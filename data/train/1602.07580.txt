    "understanding the transformation of matter in response to a change of external conditions such as temperature and pressure is one of the cornerstones of statistical physics .",
    "recently , the notion `` matter '' has come to include `` active matter ''  @xcite covering a broad class of systems in which autonomous constituents convert ( free ) energy into directed motion , ranging from flocks of birds  @xcite to bacteria  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are suspensions of self - propelled colloidal particles  @xcite due to their potential applications , _",
    "e.g. _ , for self - assembly  @xcite and sorting  @xcite .",
    "active brownian particles are a minimal model for active matter combining volume exclusion with directed motion but neglecting long - ranged phoretic and hydrodynamic interactions . for sufficiently high densities and driving speeds ,",
    "active brownian particles undergo `` clustering ''  @xcite , which strongly resembles the macroscopic liquid - vapor phase separation of passive brownian particles .",
    "this phenomenon has been described as a `` motility - induced phase transition ''  @xcite caused by the self - blocking of particles due to the interplay between directed motion and volume exclusion , the microscopic picture of which has been confirmed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "starting from the microscopic many - body dynamics , one can indeed systematically derive an effective free energy for the density  @xcite , which links active brownian particles to the scenario of liquid - vapor separation .",
    "however , such an effective description is valid only on length scales larger than the persistence length of the directed motion  @xcite .    for short - ranged interactions ,",
    "liquid - vapor phase separation of passive brownian particles falls into the universality class of the ising model and has been studied extensively  @xcite . below the critical temperature",
    "it is a first - order transition accompanied by hysteresis , which can be understood from the competition between the gain of bulk free energy driving the transition and the penalty that is associated with the formation of an interface between stable and metastable phase . as a result",
    ", the nucleation rate shows a typical non - monotonic behavior .",
    "for fixed temperature it vanishes at the `` binodal '' ( given by the coexisting densities ) and increases with increasing density ( supersaturation ) , indicating a decreasing free energy barrier .",
    "the region where this barrier becomes of the order of the thermal energy is typically identified with the `` spinodal '' ( which becomes an exact line only in mean - field models ) .",
    "increasing the supersaturation further leads to a reduced collective diffusion and consequently the nucleation rate also decreases .",
    "active brownian disks also show nucleation behavior in the vicinity of the binodal  @xcite . here",
    "we demonstrate numerically that the nucleation rate shows the same qualitative behavior as expected for liquid - vapor separation .",
    "our analysis reveals that the transition is characterized by a well - defined transition state separating the metastable homogeneous suspension ( `` reactants '' ) from the stable phase - separated state ( `` products '' ) . for systems governed by dynamics that obey detailed balance ,",
    "such a behavior is typically rationalized in terms of a free energy barrier that has to be overcome by a rare , highly collective fluctuation . in agreement with this picture",
    ", we find that when decreasing the density , the nucleation rate becomes so small that it is not observed anymore in direct simulation runs .",
    "to circumvent the prohibitively long time scales , one has to resort to numerical rare - event methods , which is an active field in computational chemistry  @xcite .",
    "here we employ forward flux sampling  @xcite , which can also be used for dynamics that explicitly break detailed balance  @xcite as is the case for active brownian particles .",
    "this allows us to obtain rates that span more than ten orders of magnitude .    finally , to gain further insights into the transition state  @xcite and the nucleation pathway , we perform a committor analysis  @xcite in the intermediate regime where nucleation is rare but still accessible by direct simulations .",
    "committor analyses have become a standard tool in computational chemistry used , _",
    "e.g. _ , to describe the demixing of a binary mixture  @xcite and crystallization  @xcite , for example of water  @xcite and hard spheres under shear  @xcite .",
    "we describe three order parameters that capture different microscopic aspects and construct a reaction coordinate through likelihood maximization  @xcite , which indicates that the polarization of particles plays a role in the nucleation of dense domains of active brownian disks .",

    "the direction motion is modelled by an effective force @xmath13 along the orientation of particles with free swimming speed @xmath14 .",

    "we employ straightforward bd simulations to obtain the nucleation times @xmath30 . to this end",
    "we run 50 independent trajectories for each packing fraction and monitor the number and sizes of clusters as a measure for dense domains .",

    "below @xmath36 no formation of dense clusters is observed anymore in direct bd simulations . to estimate the nucleation rate we thus have to resort to ffs . to this end",
    "we use the size of the largest cluster and define @xmath37 interfaces with cluster sizes @xmath38 .",
    "configurations that have @xmath39 are designated `` basin a '' ( the homogenous state ) and configurations with largest cluster @xmath40 belong to `` basin b '' ( phase - separated ) .",
    "the interfaces then guide the system from a to b by running trajectories and sequentially collecting configurations at every interface .",
    "we employ as few interfaces as possible so that conditional probabilities @xmath41 for the transitions @xmath42 are approximately independent but there is still a substantial number of trajectories reaching the next interface .",
    "the position of the last interface @xmath43 is chosen to have a numerical transfer probability of unity in the forward direction , meaning the irreversible growth of the nucleated cluster .",
    "the position of the first interface @xmath44 is determined from the distribution of cluster sizes ( obtained from direct bd runs ) so that the probability @xmath45 to observe clusters with size @xmath44 is small but not too small .",
    "values range from @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 interfaces for the highest packing fraction to @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the lowest packing fraction studied .",
    "the nucleation rate can be estimated from these simulations through @xmath52 here , @xmath53 is the rate to reach the first interface from the homogenous initial condition .",
    "this rate is multiplied by the probability to reach b , which , assuming uncorrelated interfaces , can be expressed as the product of conditional probabilities @xmath41 that trajectories reach the next interface @xmath54 when started from interface @xmath55 .",
    "we use @xmath56 independent runs to evaluate @xmath53 and collect a set of @xmath57 configurations at @xmath44 . in fig .  [",

    "we observe that , as the packing fraction decreases , the critical nucleus size increases .",
    "the critical sizes are well described by the functional form @xmath66 with fitted offset @xmath67 and coefficient @xmath68 . for passive suspensions ,",
    "classical nucleation theory  @xcite predicts a function @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the difference of chemical potential between liquid and vapor .",
    "both functions diverge as the packing fraction @xmath27 approaches the binodal at @xmath71",
    ". however , the exponent for active brownian disks is smaller such that the divergence at coexistence is less severe for active systems . even more intriguing , whereas for a passive suspension the critical cluster size approaches zero , for active brownian disks it seems to approach the constant offset @xmath72 .",
    "bd runs for packing fraction @xmath73 show that the suspension immediately starts to form dense domains , which indicates that it has become linearly unstable .",
    "still , the size of the critical cluster seems to be @xmath74 particles .",
    "this is not necessarily a contradiction since the apparent critical size is now a value that is reached by typical fluctuations , which are much stronger in the driven active system .",

    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinetics](c ) , this value agrees well with the ffs results and continues the trend .",
    "the full committor function @xmath78 is costly to determine and does not yield insights into the microscopic details of the transition _ per se_. it is often more useful to approximate @xmath88 in terms of a few order parameters , functions @xmath89 that project high - dimensional configurations onto a single number .",
    "these order parameters should provide a simplified , low - dimensional description of the progress of the `` reaction '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , the transition from basin a to basin b. in particular , they should allow to construct a good reaction coordinate @xmath90 .",
    "because the committor probability @xmath78 is the exact reaction coordinate , the isosurfaces of @xmath91 should closely approximate the isocommittor surfaces , at least close to the tse corresponding to the value @xmath92 .",

    "this order parameter takes into account the orientations of the self - propelled disks .",
    "in contrast to the net polarization ( the sum of orientations ) it projects particle orientations onto the vector from the cluster center to the particle , with particles in the rim of the cluster acquiring a larger weight ( due to their larger distance ) than the inner particles . the behavior of @xmath118 is illustrated in fig .",

    "also given are the expansion coefficients @xmath107 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab : lhood ] lists all possible linear combinations together with the normalized log - likelihood .",
    "of the three single order parameters , the cluster size @xmath32 is the best approximation to a reaction coordinate .",
    "since @xmath125 corresponds to the tse , from the coefficients for the single order parameters we can calculate their transition value . for example , the critical cluster size is found to be @xmath126 , which compares well with the direct average of @xmath127 .",
    "our analysis so far has revealed that all three order parameters , by themselves , are not good reaction coordinates .",
    "we now go a step further and test different combinations using the method of likelihood maximization , the result of which is included in table  [ tab : lhood ] .",
    "more complex models have a higher likelihood , however , the gain when using all three order parameters is marginal so that as the best model we consider the combination of cluster size @xmath32 and polarization @xmath118 . for two order parameters , from @xmath125",
    "we obtain a linear relation for the tse , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tse](d , e ) .",

    "( [ eq : tse ] ) to identify the configurations constituting the tse .",
    "the corresponding distributions @xmath93 shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : tse](i ) and  ( j ) are now indeed peaked around @xmath95 as desired .",
    "while the inclusion of the cluster density @xmath128 is already a significant improvement , the radial polarization @xmath118 is even more relevant .    of course , the three order parameters taken into account here are not the only possible choices . among others , we have also considered the anisotropy of clusters and the ratio of circumference .",
    "however , employing the described method of likelihood maximization , these three have been found to be the most relevant . this does not exclude the possibility that there is yet another order parameter that is superior in describing the nucleation of dense clusters of active brownian disks .",
    "as mentioned , the cluster size @xmath32 is a natural choice that is often sufficient to describe nucleation . as a counterexample , for the crystallization of soft particles studied in ref .",
    "it has been found that including the cluster surface improves the reaction coordinate .",
    "the physical picture for active brownian particles is quite similar , also here the particles at the cluster s surface play a role .",
    "however , it is now their orientation that is important .",
    "this can be understood quite easily .",
    "if orientations at the surface point outwards [ cf .",
    "[ fig : polarization](a ) ] they would leave the cluster , which then becomes instable and small clusters might even vanish . if the majority of particles at the surface points inwards [ cf .",
    "[ fig : polarization](c ) ] , these particles are blocked due to the inner particles , effectively stabilizing the cluster .",
    "hence , the creation of a cluster is linked to a polarization of orientations , a collective fluctuation away from the expectation value of zero for active brownian particles .     and",

    "configurations are colored according to whether they have reached the next interface , or have fallen back to the homogeneous suspension .",
    "clearly , successful configurations typically have a larger value for @xmath118 , indicating a higher polarization . even beyond the critical cluster size @xmath58",
    ", large clusters fall back if their polarization is low .",
    "computer simulations are necessarily performed in finite systems , which often has interesting and subtle consequences .",
    "for example , for liquid - vapor coexistence it has been found that in finite systems with linear dimension @xmath131 the homogeneous phase is stable also above the coexistence density @xmath132 and there is a condensation transition at a ( slightly ) higher packing fraction @xmath133 , which in passive systems in two dimensions scales as @xmath134  @xcite .     as a function of time for the lowest packing fraction @xmath130 studied .",
    "of the 5 independent runs , in one run ( arrow ) the dense domain has melted and the suspension has become homogeneous again . ]",
    "it is straightforward to see that a similar picture should hold for active brownian disks : the size of stable droplets is reduced when reducing the global packing fraction while the size of the critical nucleus increases . at some point",
    "small droplets can not be stable anymore in finite systems .",
    "interestingly , we find an `` echo '' of this evaporation transition showing that large fluctuations can destabilize clusters at low supersaturation with the suspension returning to the homogeneous state . to this end",
    ", we have run direct bd simulations at packing fraction @xmath130 initialized with configurations harvested by ffs at the last interface , which have a numerical probability of unity to commit to the phase - separated state .",
    "[ fig : stability ] shows the time series of relative cluster sizes @xmath135 ( the fraction of particles that make up the largest cluster ) .",
    "while clusters remain stable in most runs , we observe one run in which the cluster initially is stable but suddenly decays , after which the system remains homogeneous for a long time .",
    "this indicates that we are sufficiently close to the condensation / evaporation transition to observe fluctuations between homogeneous suspension and the droplet .",
    "for active hard brownian disks , we have studied the nucleation of dense domains using both brownian dynamics and forward flux sampling simulations .",
    "while active brownian particles are driven away from thermal equilibrium due to self - propulsion , it has been found previously that their large - scale behavior can be described by an effective free energy  @xcite , linking their phase behavior to that of passive liquid - vapor separation . in particular ,",
    "active hard brownian disks undergo phase separation for sufficiently large propulsion speeds . here",
    "we have shown that also the phase - separation kinetics is qualitatively very similar : the nucleation rate is exponentially small close to the binodal and increases with increasing density . at the same time",
    "the critical size of domains ( clusters ) leading to phase separation decreases .",
    "this implies an effective description in terms of a barrier that needs to be overcome by rare and collective fluctuations . performing a committor analysis we have found that the orientations of particles in the rim of clusters play an important role . in agreement with the idea of a `` spinodal '' marking the loss of linear stability , going to high supersaturation",
    "the barrier becomes low and there is a qualitative change from nucleation to demixing , _",
    "i.e. _ , domains appear almost instantaneously and coarsen over time . for the density dependence @xmath136 of critical cluster sizes we found an exponent @xmath137 in contrast to @xmath138 for passive systems .",
    "still , the kinetics of phase - separating active brownian disks is surprisingly well described by equilibrium concepts .",
    "we even find evidence that close to coexistence droplets evaporate in finite systems .",
    "the nucleation scenario unravelled in our simulations can be confirmed by experiments on light - activated diffusiophoretic colloids which exhibit phase separation  @xcite . in principle , experimental information on the cluster kinetics is directly available and the activity can be conveniently tuned to initiating the nucleation process .",
    "future work should address the impact on hydrodynamic interactions  @xcite on phase separation kinetics .",
