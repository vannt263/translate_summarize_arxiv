    "we review two scenarios in which pauli blocking has been considered previously , and then consider two new scenarios in which the experimental signature of blocking can be enhanced .",
    "whereas pioneering work treated untrapped gases @xcite , or geometries with spherical @xcite or cylindrical @xcite symmetries , we treat a generalized scenario that includes finite temperature and a tri - axial trap potential . since the high optical density of a trapped gas requires off - resonant excitation to avoid the multiple - scattering regime , we focus on scattering suppression @xcite instead of line shape @xcite .",
    "we develop , in sections  [ sec : methods ] and [ sec : basic ] , a semiclassical approach that may be applied to situations in which fully quantum calculations have proved onerous . in section  [ sec :",
    "basic ] we show that our approach reproduces fully quantum calculations in the literature .",
    "we then calculate angle - averaged finite - temperature signatures without imposing any symmetry . finding that suppression is rarely complete , we evaluate in section  [ sec : enhancement ] two approaches to stronger blocking : using a focused excitation beam , and scattering between imbalanced populations .",

    "if many states are occupied along all three harmonic axes , a semiclassical integral may capture the important physics of the problem .",
