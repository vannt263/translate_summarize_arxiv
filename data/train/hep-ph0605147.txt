    "use of the general principle of spontaneous breakdown of continuous symmetry for the @xmath1 invariant field theory description of electroweak phenomena is a necessity . hard symmetry - breaking mass terms of both gauge and fermion fields ruin , either directly or by virtue of the loops , decent high - energy behavior of certain scattering amplitudes .    in this respect",
    "the standard ` higgs ' realization of spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak symmetry deserves admiration . at the expense of introducing a sector with a condensing scalar doublet it defines the operational ( renormalizable , weakly coupled ) description of virtually all electroweak phenomena so far explored .    because of theoretical drawbacks of the higgs mechanism there are alternatives and/or generalizations thereof @xcite ( and references therein ) . in the near future the large hadron collider at cern will harshly test all of them .",
    "the aim of this paper is to add to the already existing list yet another realization of spontaneous breakdown of chiral and gauge symmetry . for clarity",
    "we illustrate it on physically and technically transparent abelian prototype .",
    "comparison with the standard abelian higgs mechanism can easily be made at any stage by heart .",
    "the basic idea @xcite is simple but subtle : as in the standard higgs realization we employ the complex scalar field but with an ordinary mass term of a complex scalar .",
    "hence , in accordance with common wisdom there will be no spontaneous symmetry breakdown in the scalar sector itself .",
    "subtle is the nonperturbative self - consistence : the chiral symmetry breaking fermion proper self - energy is both caused and causes the symmetry - breaking scalar proper self - energy , both solely due to a strong yukawa interaction .    the subsequent question of whether a massless gauge field introduced by gauging the @xmath2 axial symmetry describes a massless or a massive spin-1 particle is dynamical and it was in general answered by schwinger @xcite : if , within a given dynamics , the gauge field polarization tensor develops a massless pole , its residue approximates the gauge boson mass squared @xcite .",
    "both in the abelian higgs model and in the model presented below the massless pole in the gauge field polarization tensor is due to the ` would - be ' nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson of the underlying global symmetry . while in the higgs mechanism",
    "the ng boson is pre - prepared in the elementary scalar field , in our case it is a composite object of both the fermion and the scalar fields .    finally , it is easy to realize that due to the dynamical generation of the symmetry - breaking pieces in fermion and scalar field propagators there are new effective symmetry - breaking vertices between the mass eigenstates of the fields .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : after introducing the model by its lagrangian we discuss the possibility of the dynamical spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry and introduce the appropriate formalism .",
    "then we explore the consequences of the global symmetry : the existence of the ` would - be ' ng boson and its interaction vertices with other particles .",
    "in this part we only repeat the main results of our preceding paper @xcite so we do not go into a detail . after this",
    "we present some consequences of the local symmetry : the mass of the gauge boson , induced by the bilinear coupling with the ` would - be ' ng boson , and the existence of the effective trilinear coupling of the gauge bosons . in the end we present our numerical results , especially the possibility of an arbitrarily high ratio of fermion masses with yukawa coupling constants being of the same order of magnitude , together with the description of our numerical procedure .",
    "in the full generality the model is defined by the lagrangian @xmath3 where the yukawa interaction lagrangian reads @xmath4 the lagrangian possesses various symmetries .",
    "first , it is invariant under the _ global _ @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "the two global vector @xmath2 symmetries are generated by the fermion number operators of the fermions 1 and 2 and represent separate conservation of the number of both fermion species .",
    "the two naive independent axial @xmath2 transformations of the fermions 1 and 2 are related to each other by the yukawa couplings to the scalar field @xmath6 .",
    "second , the lagrangian is invariant under the _ local _ ( gauge ) @xmath7 transformations , acting on the fields as @xmath8 where the axial charges @xmath9 , @xmath10 are defined as @xmath11    considering two fermion species with opposite axial charges provides the simplest solution to an important theoretical constraint imposed on the model , which is the absence of the axial anomaly .",
    "the yukawa coupling constants @xmath12 , @xmath13 are arbitrary real numbers . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we do not consider a more general yukawa lagrangian , allowing them to be complex .",
    "in the first step we switch off the gauge interaction @xmath14 and demonstrate the spontaneous breakdown of the global @xmath7 symmetry by finding symmetry - breaking proper self - energies in the fermion and scalar field propagators .",
    "we follow the general self - consistent nonperturbative method suggested by nambu ( and jona - lasinio ) @xcite .    first of all , it is convenient to introduce the nambu - like doublet field for the scalar @xmath15 and its matrix propagator @xmath16 the point is that this formalism allows us to treat the symmetry - preserving ( the diagonal entries ) as well as the symmetry - breaking ( the off - diagonal entries ) scalar propagators on the same footing .",
    "similarly in the fermion sector , it is convenient to deal with the propagator @xmath17 as it also contains both the symmetry - preserving ( e.g. @xmath18 ) and the symmetry - breaking ( e.g. @xmath19 ) fermion propagators .",
    "however , although it would be possible , and even desirable , to deal with the propagators in the full generality , we will adopt for the present purposes the specific _ ansatz _ :",

    "propagators , i.e. the proper self - energies . by this ansatz",
    "we focus only on the symmetry - breaking parts of the propagators and totally neglect any possible effects of wave - function renormalization . for the purposes of the present paper",
    "this approximation is sufficient , since we wish only to demonstrate spontaneous symmetry breaking and not to make at this stage any phenomenological predictions . in a more realistic version of the model aspiring to describe the nature and make reasonable physical predictions it would be , however , a must to include systematically all radiative corrections .",
    "our general strategy in demonstrating the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath7 symmetry will be to search for the symmetry breaking parts of the propagators , i.e. the self - energies @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "our aim was to find the dependence of the spectrum ",
    "the masses of the fermions , scalar bosons and the vector boson  on the yukawa coupling constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 [ or , more precisely , on absolute values @xmath129 and @xmath130 , due to the shape of the schwinger - dyson equations ( [ sd_euclidean ] ) ] . for the calculation of masses",

    "we have probed the @xmath131-dependence along the cut depicted in fig .",
    "[ y_plane_pic ] , since it connects all the three main areas @xmath126 , @xmath123 and @xmath132 and therefore the resulting @xmath131-dependence of the spectrum can be regarded as quite typical .",

    "if @xmath143 , we considered @xmath144 to be the solution .",
    "this simple criterion is sufficient in our case because the functions @xmath144 turn out to be well behaved : there are no intersections between distinct iterations , or , loosely speaking , their shapes are similar , the only changes are in their ` size ' ( at least in the nonasymptotic region ) .",
    "usual behavior of such a nonlinear system in the case of only _",
    "one equation for one unknown function _",
    "( for instance an equation for @xmath136 with @xmath26 set to be a constant ) is such that for _ any _ initial ansatz the iteration procedure converges to some solution",
    ". the solution may be trivial ( i.e. @xmath145 , @xmath146 ) or nontrivial ( i.e. @xmath147 ) , depending whether @xmath148 or @xmath149 , respectively , for some critical value @xmath150 .    in our case of more _",
    "coupled _ equations the situation is , however , different .",
    "having some fixed ansatz , there are three possibilities : ( 1 ) the iteration procedure converges to the trivial solution [ which exists always for all @xmath120 ] .",
    "( 2 ) it blows up ( i.e. @xmath152 , @xmath153 ) .",
    "( 3 ) it converges to a nontrivial solution ( if it exists ) , depending on the @xmath120 ( see fig .",
    "[ y_plane_pic ] ) .",
    "this behavior clearly depends on the ansatz . to be specific ,",
    "our class of anstze consisted of functions @xmath154 with @xmath155 being a free parameter . for @xmath155 too small or too large",
    "the iteration procedure goes to the trivial solution or blows up , respectively . properly adjusting the value of @xmath155 between these two extremes",
    "one can manage that the iteration procedure converges to the nontrivial solution .",
    "a special care was taken to check whether the numerical procedure is stable in the sense that its results ( especially the strong @xmath131-dependence of the fermion masses ) remain unchanged upon the changes of the numerical algorithm .",
    "we tested four main variations of the algorithm :    class of anstze : :    besides ( [ ansatz_num ] ) we considered also other ansatz classes , all    functions decreasing as some power of @xmath40 or    exponentially , respectively .",
    "for some of them ( some very rapidly    decreasing exponentials ) it was not possible to adjust the variable    @xmath155 [ see ( [ ansatz_num ] ) ] to converge to any but the    trivial solution .",
    "for the other ansatz classes , however , the results    were nontrivial and they all coincided .",
    "step size : :    there is , of course , a step size dependence of the numerical    integration results , the important question is , however , how this    dependence behaves for arbitrarily small step sizes .",
    "if there is no    sensible ( i.e. finite ) limit of the integral as the step sizes are    going to zero ( the continuum limit ) , the results of the numerical    integration have no meaning .",
    "we checked that this limit does exist and    that all described phenomena , especially the strong    @xmath131-dependence of the fermion masses , are present in    it .",
    "integration method : :    having expressed the integral equations ( [ sd_euclidean ] ) in the    hyperspherical coordinates , we can do two angular integrations    analytically .",
    "the two remaining integrations ( one over momentum and    one angular ) must be performed numerically . for this purpose",
    "we    employed consecutively the trapezoidal rule and the simpson s rule ,    for the angular integration also the gauss - chebyshev quadrature    formula ( using chebyshev polynomials of the second kind ) .",
    "the final    results for all integration methods agreed , the differences were only    in the step size dependence , i.e. in the speed of convergence to the    continuum limit .",
    "momentum cut - off : :    since the momentum integral is over the infinite interval , for the    purposes of the numerical integration a momentum cut - off must be    introduced .",
    "however it turns out that one does not need to check the    cut - off dependence of the results .",
    "that is because the resulting    self - energies are so rapidly decreasing that the contribution from the    high momenta is negligible .",
    "moreover , in order to check the consistency of our numerical method by a comparison with an independent result , we calculated the equation for @xmath57 [ see ( [ sd_euclidean ] ) ] with @xmath26 set to be a constant [ up to our knowledge , there are no independent calculations of the full set of the coupled equations ( [ sd_euclidean ] ) we could compare with ] and compared our result with the results of @xcite [ eq . ( 2.11 ) and",
    "fig . 3 therein ] .",
    "they coincided .",
    "within the effective quantum field theory for electroweak interactions at forthcoming energy scale we find the use of scalar fields still welcome : their yukawa couplings with massless elementary fermion fields break explicitly the huge chiral symmetries of three electroweakly identical fermion families exactly to the sanctified @xmath1 .",
    "alternatives without scalars struggle with guaranteeing unobservability of physical consequences of these unwanted symmetries .",
    "linear dependences of the wildly wide , sparse and irregular fermion mass spectrum upon the yukawa coupling constants of the standard model are , however , a drawback .",
    "it is feasible that the fermion masses can be generated by the yukawa interactions dynamically without ever referring to the scalar field condensation @xcite .",
    "in such a case the dependences of the fermion masses upon the yukawa coupling constants would be nonanalytic . in an abelian prototype we have provided a bona fide indication that this is possible .",
    "most importantly , we have convincingly demonstrated that a small change in the ratio of the yukawa couplings may lead to an orders - of - magnitude change in the ratio of the generated fermion masses .",
    "we hope that this mechanism could provide a natural explanation of the hierarchy of fermion masses in the standard model .",
    "the price we pay is that the yukawa interactions having the expected properties must be strong .",
    "but we are accustomed to live with qcd strongly interacting at large distances even though we still do nt know how to solve it ( incidentally , apart from the ng sector ) .",
    "we are tempted to interpret our findings as manifestations of nontrivial fixed points @xcite in our model .",
    "the bonus we get is an interesting relation of fermion and gauge boson mass generation mechanisms .",
    "indeed , in contrast with the higgs mechanism in our case for the yukawa couplings set to zero both fermion and gauge boson masses vanish .",
    "we are confident that with some technical modifications the generalization of the abelian mechanism presented above to @xmath156 can be done @xcite .",
    "whether it can be converted into a phenomenologically viable alternative of the standard model remains , however , to be seen .",
