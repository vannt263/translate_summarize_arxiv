    "problems of optimal control of singularly perturbed ( sp ) systems have been studied intensively in both deterministic and stochastic settings ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for a sample of the literature ) .",
    "originally , the most common approaches to sp control systems , especially in the deterministic case , were related to an approximation of the slow dynamics by the solutions of the systems obtained via equating of the singular perturbations parameter to zero , with further application of the boundary layer method ( see @xcite , @xcite ) for an asymptotical description of the fast dynamics .",
    "this type of approaches were successfully applied to a number of important classes of problems ( see , e.g , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "various averaging type approaches allowing a consideration of more general classes of sp problems , in which the optimal and near optimal controls take the form of rapidly oscillating functions and in which equating of the small parameter to zero does not lead to a right approximation , were studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( see also references therein ) . this research lead to a good understanding of what the true limit \" problems , optimal solutions of which",
    "approximate optimal solutions of the sp problems , are . however , till recently , no algorithms for finding such approximating solutions ( in case fast oscillations may lead to a significant improvement of the performance ) have been discussed in the literature , and ( to the best of our knowledge ) first steps in this direction have been made in the recent publication @xcite .",
    "the present paper continues the line of research started in @xcite . as in @xcite ,",
    "our consideration is based on earlier results on averaging of sp control systems obtained in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and on results obtained in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that establish the equivalence of optimal control problems to certain infinite dimensional ( i d ) linear programming ( lp ) problems ( related results on idlp formulations of optimal control problems in both deterministic and stochastic settings can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , where mostly optimal control problems with time discounting criteria were dealt with , this paper is devoted to the consideration of the problems with long run average optimality criteria .    as in @xcite",
    ", we , first , asymptotically approximate a given problem of optimal control of the sp system by a certain averaged optimal control problem , then reformulate this averaged problem as an idlp problem , and then approximate the latter by semi - infinite lp problems .",
    "we show that the optimal solution of these semi - infinite lp problems and their duals ( that can be found with the help of a modification of an available lp software ) allow one to construct near optimal controls of the sp system .",
    "note that , while the approach we exploit is similar to that of @xcite , the results of this paper are obtained under different assumptions and require a more elaborated argument than those used in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "it consists of eight sections .",
    "section [ sec - contents ] is this introduction . in section 2",
    ", we establish some basic relationships between the sp and the averaged optimal control problems and their idlp counterparts ( propositions [ prop - averaging - result ] and [ prop - inequalities - equalities ] ) . in section [ sec - acg ] ,",
    "the concept of the average control generating ( acg ) families for sp problems with long run average criteria is introduced ( definition [ def - acg ] ) and sufficient and necessary conditions for an acg family to be optimal are established under the assumption that solutions of the averaged and associated dual problems exist ( proposition [ prop - necessary - opt - cond ] and remark [ remark - nec - opt - cond ] ) . in section [ n - approx - dual - opt ] , an approximating averaged semi - infinite lp problem is introduced and it is shown that solutions of the corresponding averaged and associated dual problems exist under natural controllability conditions ( proposition [ prop - existence - disc ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec - acg - construction ] , it is established that , if certain assumptions are satisfied , then solutions of the approximating averaged and associated dual problems can be used for the construction of near optimal acg families ( theorem [ main - sp - nemeric ] ) . in section [ sect - asympt - near - opt ] , we indicate a way how asymptotically near optimal controls of the sp problems with long run time average criteria can be constructed on the basis of near optimal acg families ( theorem [ main - sp - sp - nemeric ] ) , the construction being illustrated with a numerical example . in sections [ sec - selected - proofs ] and [ sec - selected - proofs - new ] , we give proofs of theorem [ main - sp - nemeric ] and theorem [ main - sp - sp - nemeric ] .",

    "<S> the paper aims at the development of tools for analysis and construction of near optimal solutions of singularly perturbed ( sp ) optimal controls problems with long run average optimality criteria . </S>",
    "<S> the idea that we exploit is to first asymptotically approximate a given problem of optimal control of the sp system by a certain averaged optimal control problem , then reformulate this averaged problem as an infinite - dimensional ( i d ) linear programming ( lp ) problem , and then approximate the latter by semi - infinite lp problems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the optimal solution of these semi - infinite lp problems and their duals ( that can be found with the help of a modification of an available lp software ) allow one to construct near optimal controls of the sp system . </S>",
