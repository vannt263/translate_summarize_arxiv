    "clusters of galaxies are thought to grow into larger systems through complex interactions between smaller systems .",
    "signatures of merging events include temperature and density inhomogeneities and bulk motions in the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",

    "measurements of the icm temperature and velocity structure , therefore , provide crucial information for understanding the evolution of clusters .",
    "velocity measurements of bulk motion and turbulence are essential for mass estimation and cosmological studies .",
    "if icm has a significant bulk velocity compared to its thermal velocity , the associated non - thermal pressure would threaten the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in deriving the total gravitational mass in a cluster .",
    "for example , factors of 23 discrepancies between the x - ray and lensing mass estimates in some objects ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) could be partly due to this effect .",
    "@xcite discovered a significant bulk motion in abell  2256 , which is a well known merging cluster .",
    "@xcite performed a fourier analysis of xmm - newton data of the coma cluster , which revealed the presence of a scale - invariant pressure fluctuation ranging between 29 and 64 kpc , and @xmath410% of the total pressure in turbulent form .",
    "however , in relaxed clusters , significant bulk motions and turbulence have not been detected .",
    "on the basis of asca and chandra data , @xcite claimed a large velocity gradient of @xmath42400 km  s@xmath3 in the centaurus cluster , which is a relaxed cluster with a cool core .",
    "however , @xcite found a negative result of @xmath5  km  s@xmath3 on the basis of suzaku observations of the centaurus cluster .",
    "@xcite also searched for possible bulk motions in the awm  7 cluster with suzaku , and observed no significant bulk motions .",

    "the coma cluster ( @xmath7 ) , also known as abell  1656 , is one of the most studied clusters @xcite and has been observed at all wavelengths from radio to hard x - ray bands .",
    "however , the physical state , particularly the dynamical state , of the coma cluster has not been completely understood .",

    "the thermal x - ray emission of the coma cluster has been observed with several x - ray satellites .",
    "@xcite constructed an x - ray map of the coma cluster using rosat all - sky - survey data and determined the x - ray surface brightness profile of the cluster out to a radius of roughly 100@xmath0 .",
    "the temperature maps of clusters provide knowledge about the history of past subcluster mergers . on the basis of asca observations , @xcite and @xcite found that icm is not isothermal .",
    "@xcite used xmm - newton to study the temperature structure in the central region of the coma cluster .",
    "the projected temperature distribution around ngc  4889 and ngc  4874 is remarkably homogeneous , which suggests that the core is mostly in a relaxed state . except at the center ,",
    "the temperature decreases slightly with radius .",

    "rosat observed a substructure around the ngc  4839 subgroup @xcite , and a hot region in the direction of ngc  4839 was observed by @xcite . by xmm - newton observations",
    ", @xcite found compelling evidence for the subgroup around ngc  4839 was on its first infall into the coma cluster , but it had not passed its core yet .",
    "this interpretation is different from that of @xcite , who suggested that the ngc  4839 group was moving out of the cluster after having already passed through the coma cluster .",
    "non - thermal electrons , observed via diffused radio synchrotron emission , have been detected in more than 50 clusters , and all of them are undergoing mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "this paper reports results from six suzaku observations of the coma cluster out to 60@xmath0 , @xmath81.5 mpc , conducted using the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) @xcite onboard suzaku @xcite . owing to its lower background level , suzaku has better sensitivity to the iron k@xmath1 lines than previous satellites .",

    "if the cluster had been an isolated system collapsing from self - gravity , the temperature structures would be symmetric .",
    "the observed asymmetry in the temperature distribution indicates that external effects or interactions , such as merging , have occurred .",
    "numerical simulations of the evolution of the cluster ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) show that nonaxisymmetric structures in the temperature distribution are erased several gyr after each merger .",
    "the presence of asymmetric temperature structures suggest that the central region of the coma cluster has experienced a merger , and the lack of hard component shows that its core have relaxed in the last several gyr .",
    "the observed cool region in the southeast of the center region coincides with the filamentary structure originating near ngc 4911 and ngc 4921 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the temperature of this cold area ranges from 5 to 7 kev .",
    "this region mostly contain the stripped subcluster gas , which is thought to be relatively cool in the initial state .",
    "the numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggest that the gas would maintain its temperature for several gyr .",
    "@xcite showed that even a single subcluster collision with supersonic velocity creates both hot and cool regions in the main cluster .",
    "although heating due to collisions occurs , cooling would also occur through the adiabatic expansion of the stripped gas .",
    "the measurements of bulk motions in icm are also important to derive the gravitational mass of clusters of galaxies .",
    "we constrained the upper limit of icm bulk motions in the center and offset regions on the scale of 117 kpc ( ) and 234 kpc ( 9@xmath0 ) , respectively , which correspond to the scales of regions for spectral accumulation ( see section [ sec : obs ] and subsection [ sec : resultred ] ) .",
    "the upper limit of gas bulk motions is @xmath297 @xmath298 1100 km s@xmath3 .",
    "as summarized in table [ tab : redshift ] , considering the systematic error of 18 ev , or 818 km s@xmath3 with a 90@xmath286 confidence level ( section [ subsec : cal ] ) , there are no significant bulk motions in the center and offset fields .",
    "compared with the sound velocity of the coma cluster , @xmath317 km s@xmath3 for a temperature of @xmath47 = 8 kev , the bulk - motion in the central region of the coma cluster does not exceed the sound velocity .",
    "our results do not conflict with the discovery of pressure fluctuations in the center of the coma cluster by @xcite which indicates that at least 10% of the icm pressure is in turbulent form .",
    "we have not constrained the turbulence , and the scale of the fluctuation ranges between 29 kpc and 64 kpc , which is smaller than our scale of spectral analysis .",
    "the velocity difference between the main cluster and the ngc 4839 subcluster from optical observations is 486 km s@xmath3 .",
    "although the best - fit line - of - sight velocity of the subcluster is higher than that of the main cluster by @xmath4 1000 km s@xmath3 , the difference is comparable to statistical and systematic errors . because the temperature of the region is about 5 kev ,",
    "the sound velocity is @xmath4 1150 km s@xmath3 . considering the error bars ,",
    "we conclude that the relative line - of - sight gas velocity in the ngc 4839 subgroup region does not greatly exceed the sound velocity .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that a major merger between clusters raises the temperature of icm and induces a bulk velocity of the order of 1000 km s@xmath3 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the late phase of mergers , turbulent motions develop in a simulation by @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of bulk - motions in icm of the coma cluster also indicates that the central region of the cluster is in a somewhat relaxed state .",
    "if so , the non - thermal electrons relevant to the radio halo of the coma cluster may have been accelerated by the intracluster turbulence rather than shocks . in conclusion",
    ", the line - of - sight gas velocity of the coma cluster in the observed region does not greatly exceed the sound velocity , and the central region of the coma cluster is in a nearly relaxed state .",
    "this means that the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is approximately valid in calculating the cluster mass of the coma cluster .",
    "the fe abundance is nearly constant at @xmath4 0.4 solar within a clustocentric radius of 0.5 mpc , and beyond that distance it decreases with the radius to 0.20.3 solar .",
    "this profile is consistent with those measured by xmm ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "suzaku has a lower level of background , and a slightly better energy resolution : therefore , systematic uncertainties in fe abundance are considered to be smaller .",
    "differences in abundance profiles of icm in central regions of clusters with and without cool cores have been reported ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed an abundance difference between the two type of clusters within 0.1@xmath312 , while at 0.10.3@xmath312 , the average values of fe abundances are both @xmath4 0.40.5 solar , and are consistent with each other .",
    "the coma cluster is thought to have experienced a major merger in the recent past and subsequently , the central region came to a somewhat relaxed state . during a cluster merger ,",
    "the mixing of icm could destroy any central fe peak .",
    "in the first stage of merging , the fe peak and cool core remain intact as observed in some ongoing merging clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , abell  2256 , an ongoing merging cluster , has an abundance gradient in the direction opposite of the merging direction owing to the remixing of the gas .",
    "numerical simulation also support this scenario .",
    "@xcite performed hydrodynamical simulations with two different merger types of clusters : cluster 1 has only small merger events , while cluster 2 undergoes a major merger ( mass ratio 1:3 ) . in cluster 1 ,",
    "the abundance is more than @xmath4 0.4 solar within a radius of 0.1 mpc , and decreases from @xmath4 0.3 solar to @xmath4 0.1 solar with a decrease in radius .",
    "the situation is different in cluster 2 . in the coma cluster ,",
    "the fe abundance is @xmath4 0.4 solar and homogeneous within a radius of 0.5 mpc .",
    "this value of the fe abundance is similar to those at 0.20.3@xmath312 in other clusters as shown in figure  [ fig : fe ] .",
    "therefore , tn the coma cluster , the merger have destroyed the cool core , and mixed the icm completely at least within 0.5 mpc .",
    "the coma cluster which was observed with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) onboard suzaku , was analyzed by the x - ray satellite in six pointings , centered on the x - ray peak and offset by west , , , , and .",
    "because of its low background , suzaku is the most sensitive x - ray satellite for observing k@xmath1 lines of fe in the intracluster medium . after obtaining accurate measurements of fe lines",
    ", we studied the temperature structure of the intracluster medium , searched for possible bulk - motions , and measured the fe abundance in the cluster .",
    "the spectra of each extracted region were well fitted by the single - temperature apec model , and the two- or three- temperature apec model did not improve @xmath2 .",
    "the temperatures derived from the observed ratios of k@xmath1 lines of h - like and he - like fe agree well with those from spectral fittings with the single - temperature apec model .",
    "because this line ratio is a strong function of plasma temperature , the observed consistency supports the accuracy of temperature measurements with suzaku , and constrains the temperature structure of icm .",
    "the observed values of the central energy of the he - like fe line of the center , , and offset regions are constant within 500 @xmath318 , which corresponds to the calibration error .",
    "because relative bulk velocities in the coma cluster are smaller than the sound velocity of the intracluster medium , 1500 km s @xmath3 , we can verify the derived total mass in a cluster on the basis of the hydrostatic icm equilibrium inside the offset region .",
    "significant bulk velocities were also not found in the offset region , which corresponds to the ngc 4839 subcluster .",
    "the results on the temperature and velocity structure suggest that the core of the coma cluster is in a fairly relaxed state .",
    "this is consistent with models in which the non - thermal electrons relevant to the radio halo are accelerated by the intracluster turbulence rather than large - scale shocks .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that numerical simulations show that the turbulence motion is developed in the late phase of mergers .",
    "the observed fe abundance of the intracluster medium is almost constant at 0.4 solar inside the offset region , and decreases with radius .",
    "the central abundance is slightly lower than that of other clusters or groups .",
    "this indicates that central regions of the gas were mixed well during the past merger growth of the cluster .",
