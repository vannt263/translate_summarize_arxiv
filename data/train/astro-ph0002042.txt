    "correlations among physical quantities of clusters of galaxies are very useful tools for studying the formation of clusters and cosmological parameters .",
    "recently , we have found that clusters at low redshifts ( @xmath1 ) form a plane ( the fundamental plane ) in the three dimensional space represented by their core structures , that is , the central gas density @xmath2 , core radius @xmath3 , and x - ray temperature @xmath4 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  i ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a simple theoretical model of cluster formation predicts that clusters should be characterized by the virial density @xmath5 ( or the collapse redshift @xmath6 ) and the virial mass @xmath7 ( @xcite , paper  ii ) .",
    "thus , assuming the similarity of the dark matter distributions , clusters should form a plane in the three dimensional space of the dark matter density in the core @xmath8 , the core radius of dark matter distribution @xmath9 , and the virial temperature @xmath10 .",
    "however , the relations between the two planes are not simple ; for example , it is found that @xmath11 is not proportional to @xmath12 . in paper",
    "i , we found that the ratio @xmath13 is not constant but obeys the relation of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the core mass .",
    "this raises the question how the segregation between gas and dark matter occurs .    in the hierarchical structure formation",
    ", dark halos are expected to obey scaling relations .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations suggest that the density distribution in dark halos take a universal form as claimed by @xcite . on a cluster scale",
    ", it can be approximated by @xmath16 for @xmath17 mpc , where detailed x - ray observations have been done @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , observations show that the slope of the density profile of the hot diffuse intracluster gas has a range of value .",
    "radial surface brightness profiles of x - ray emission are often fitted with the conventional @xmath18 model as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the slope parameter @xcite .",
    "if the intracluster gas is isothermal , equation ( [ eq : sur ] ) corresponds to the gas density profile of @xmath21 observations show that the slope parameter takes a range @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this means that for @xmath23 , the density profiles range from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , which are more diverse than those of dark matter .",
    "moreover , observations show that the clusters with large @xmath3 and @xmath4 tend to have large @xmath20 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the average gas fraction of clusters within radii much larger than @xmath26 should be universal and the dark matter distribution of clusters is also universal , the variation of @xmath20 is expected to correlate with that of the gas fraction in the core region . in other words ,",
    "the gas fraction at the core is not the same as that of the whole cluster and is not proportional to the dark matter density .",
    "this fact must be taken care of when we discuss cosmological parameters using observational x - ray data . since the emissivity of x - ray gas is proportional to @xmath27 , most of the x - ray emission of a cluster comes form the central region where @xmath28 is large .",
    "although in papers i and ii , we did not take account of the effects of @xmath20 , we did find the gas mass fraction in the core region is diverse by analyzing the x - ray emission . in this paper , we reanalyze the data taking account of @xmath20 and discuss the relation between core and global gas mass fractions",
    ". we will also show that major conclusions on the fundamental relations are not changed .",
    "the variation of gas mass fraction itself has been investigated by several authors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argue that it is partially explained if the dark matter has a significant baryonic component .",
    "another possible explanation of the diverse gas distributions is that intracluster gas had already been heated before the collapse into the cluster ; the energetic winds generated by supernovae are one possible mechanism to increase gas entropy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , @xcite find that the entropy of the intracluster gas near the center of clusters is higher than can be explained by gravitational collapse alone . in order to estimate the effect of the preheating on intracluster gas",
    ", we must take account of shocks forming when the gas collapses into the cluster ; they supply additional entropy to the gas .",
    "@xcite have investigated both the effects and predicted the relation between x - ray luminosities and temperatures ( @xmath29 relation ) .",
    "they predicted that the gas distributions of poor clusters are flatter than those of rich clusters , which results in a steeper slope of @xmath30 relation for poor clusters .",
    "this is generally consistent with the observations .",
    "it is an interesting issue to investigate whether this scenario provides a natural explanation for the observed dispersion of gas mass fraction in the cluster core and whether it reproduces the x - ray fundamental plane we found in paper i in our general theoretical scenario .    in order to clarify",
    "what determines the gas distribution , we construct as a simple model as possible .",
    "although many authors have studied the preheating of clusters ( @xcite ) , this is the first time to consider the influence of the preheating and shocks on the fundamental plane and two - parameter family nature of clusters paying attention to the difference between the collapse redshift @xmath6 and the observed redshift @xmath31 of clusters explicitly . in ",
    "[ sec : model ] , we explain the model of dark matter potential and shock heating of intracluster gas . in  [ sec : result ] , we use the model to predict @xmath32 and @xmath33 relations , and the fundamental plane and band of clusters .",
    "the predictions are compared with observations .",
    "in order to predict the relations among parameters describing a dark matter potential , we use a spherical collapse model @xcite . although the details are described in paper  ii ,",
    "we summarize them here for convenience .",
    "the virial density of a cluster @xmath5 at the time of the cluster collapse ( @xmath6 ) is @xmath34 times the critical density of a universe at @xmath35 .",
    "it is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the cosmological density parameter , and @xmath38 , where we do not take account of the cosmological constant .",
    "the index 0 refers to the values at @xmath39 .",
    "note that the redshift - dependent hubble constant can be written as @xmath40 .",
    "we adopt @xmath41 for numerical values . in practice",
    ", we use the fitting formula of @xcite for the virial density : @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "it is convenient to relate the collapse time in the spherical model with the density contrast calculated by the linear theory .",
    "we define the critical density contrast @xmath44 that is the value , extrapolated to the present time ( @xmath45 ) using linear theory , of the overdensity which collapses at @xmath46 in the exact spherical model .",
    "it is given by @xmath47                 \\;\\;\\;\\ ; ( \\omega_0 < 1 ) \\\\         & = & \\frac{3(12\\pi)^{2/3}}{20 }             \\left(\\frac{t_0}{t_{\\rm coll}}\\right)^{2/3 }                 \\;\\;\\;\\ ; ( \\omega_0 = 1 ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xcite , where @xmath48 is the linear growth factor given by equation ( a13 ) of @xcite and @xmath49 .",
    "for a power - law initial fluctuation spectrum @xmath50 , the rms amplitude of the linear mass fluctuations in a sphere containing an average mass @xmath51 at a given time is @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the virial mass of clusters which collapse at @xmath53 is related to that at @xmath54 as @xmath55^{-6/(n+3 ) }                    \\;.\\ ] ] here , @xmath56)$ ] is regarded as a variable because actual amplitude of initial fluctuations has a distribution .",
    "we relate @xmath46 to the collapse or formation redshift @xmath57 , which depends on cosmological parameters .",
    "thus , @xmath7 is a function of @xmath6 as well as @xmath58 .",
    "this means that for a given mass scale @xmath7 , the amplitude of initial fluctuations takes a range of value , and spheres containing a mass of @xmath7 collapse at a range of redshift . in the following ,",
    "the slope of the spectrum is fixed at @xmath59 .",
    "it is typical of the scenario of standard cold dark matter for a cluster mass range , and is consistent with observations as shown in paper  ii .    the virial radius and temperature of a cluster",
    "are then calculated by @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath63 is the hydrogen mass , @xmath64 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath65 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath66 is a fudge factor which typically ranges between 1 and 1.5 . in paper",
    "ii , we adopted the value @xmath67 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath66 is applied only to dark matter , but not to gas , because we do _ not _ assume @xmath68 here .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath7 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are the virial mass , density , and radius at the time of the cluster collapse , respectively .      to study the effect of preheating",
    ", we here adopt a very simple model as a first step .",
    "when a cluster collapses , we expect that a shock wave forms and the infalling gas is heated . in order to derive the postshock temperature",
    ", we use a shock model of @xcite . for a given preshock temperature @xmath71",
    ", the postshock temperature @xmath72 can be calculated from the rankine - hugoniot relations .",
    "assuming that the shock is strong and that the shock front forms in the vicinity of @xmath70 , it is approximately given by @xmath73 @xcite , where @xmath74 is the potential at @xmath75 .",
    "according to the virial theorem and the continuity when @xmath71 approaches zero , we should take @xmath76 . for @xmath77 , we assume that the gas is isothermal and hydrostatic , and that the matter accretion after the cluster collapse does not much change the structure of the central region of the cluster significantly , as confirmed by numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is to be noted that even if the density profile of dark matter is represented by the universal profile @xcite , it is not inconsistent with the isothermal @xmath18 model of gas represented by equation ( [ eq : gas_obs ] ) ( @xcite ) within the present observational scopes . on these assumptions ,",
    "the gas temperature in the inner region of a cluster is @xmath78 , and the mass within @xmath75 of the cluster center @xmath79 is related to the density profile of intracluster gas , @xmath28 , by @xmath80 since @xmath81 , equations ( [ eq : temp ] ) and ( [ eq : mdm ] ) yield @xmath82 defining @xmath83 , the gas density profile is thus given by @xmath84 as long as ( @xmath85 ) is nearly constant .    equation ( [ eq : shock ] ) shows that in this model @xmath18 is a function of only @xmath10 when @xmath71 is regarded as an external parameter , that is , @xmath86 since @xmath87 , equation ( [ eq : beta2 ] ) is written as @xmath88 thus , the @xmath89 relation can be used to determine @xmath71 by comparing with the observation .",
    "since both @xmath10 and @xmath90 are the two - parameter families of @xmath6 and @xmath91 ( equations [ [ eq : density ] ] , [ [ eq : mass]],[[eq : rad ] ] and [ [ eq : temp ] ] ) , equation ( [ eq : beta2 ] ) shows that @xmath18 can be represented by @xmath70 as @xmath92 , if @xmath71 is specified .",
    "recent numerical simulations suggest that the structure of central region of clusters is related to @xmath6 @xcite , and in particular @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath70 @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if we assume that @xmath93 and that @xmath94 is constant as in paper  ii , @xmath71 can also be determined by comparing the theoretical prediction of the @xmath95 relation with the observation . since a spherical collapse model predicts @xmath96 mpc and observations show that @xmath97 mpc ( figure 1b in paper  ii ) , we adopt @xmath98 from now on .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath99 , m_{\\rm vir , 0})$ ] .",
    "using the model constructed in  [ sec : shock ] , we predict relations between @xmath18 and @xmath4 , and between @xmath18 and @xmath100 .",
    "if @xmath71 is mainly determined by the energetic winds generated in the forming galaxies or quasars before the formation of clusters , @xmath71 should be constant if subsequent adiabatic heating or cooling is neglected .",
    "however , if , besides the winds , the gravitational energy released in the subclusters , which later merged into the observed clusters , contributes to @xmath71 , we expect that @xmath71 has a distribution produced by different merging histories . in order to determine the distribution in detail",
    ", we must calculate the merging histories by monte carlo realizations as @xcite did . in this study , however , we consider the scatter by investigating a range of @xmath71 for simplicity . we show in figure [ fig1 ] the @xmath89 relation for @xmath101 , 1 , and 2 kev .",
    "the observational data are overlaid .",
    "since equation ( [ eq : gas_obs ] ) is approximated to be @xmath102 for @xmath103 , the relation @xmath104 is obtained by comparing the relation ( [ eq : beta ] ) . thus , in the following figures , the observed values of @xmath20 are converted by relation ( [ eq : beta_beta ] ) . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we assumed @xmath67 .",
    "as the data , we use only relatively hot ( @xmath105 kev ) and low redshift ( @xmath1 ) clusters obtained by @xcite and @xcite . instead of @xmath20 , @xcite present velocity dispersions corresponding to gravitational potential well , @xmath106 , derived with the deprojection method , ignoring velocity dispersion anisotropies and gradients .",
    "thus , for the data we assume that @xmath107 and define @xmath18 as @xmath108 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that the observational data are consistent with @xmath109 kev but it seems that a single value of @xmath71 does not represent the range of data .",
    "the preheating ( @xmath110 ) is expected to reduce @xmath18 of the clusters with small @xmath4 ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) . at first glance ,",
    "no correlations between @xmath18 and @xmath4 are recognized observationally in this temperature range .",
    "however , some reports on the existence of a weak correlation have been made when clusters with lower @xmath4 are included ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our prediction is not inconsistent with the observations .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : shock ] , the @xmath95 relation is represented by two parameters @xmath6 and @xmath58 , for a given value of @xmath71 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] for @xmath67 .",
    "figure  [ fig2]a and  [ fig2]b are for @xmath111 and 0.2 , respectively . for comparison",
    ", we also present observational data @xcite .",
    "as was in paper  i , for the data of @xcite we use here only the component of surface brightness reflecting the global structure of clusters , although the central component ( so - called cooling flow component ) may also have formed in the scenario of hierarchical clustering @xcite .",
    "the mass @xmath58 corresponds to the mass of clusters collapsed at @xmath112 and takes a range of value due to the dispersion of initial density fluctuation of the universe .",
    "since observations and numerical simulations show @xmath113 @xcite , the observational data are expected to lie between the two lines of @xmath114 ( arc bc ) and @xmath115 ( arc ad ) for fixed @xmath71 in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "note that the distribution of @xmath58 degenerates on the lines in figure  [ fig1 ] . in figure  [ fig2 ] , the positions along the arcs ad and bc indicate the formation redshifts of the clusters .",
    "when @xmath116 , most of the observed clusters should have collapsed at @xmath112 because clusters continue growing even at @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "thus , the cluster data are expected to be distributed along the part of the lines close to the point of @xmath117 ( segment ab ) .",
    "in fact , calculations done by @xcite , and @xcite show that if @xmath116 , most of present day clusters ( @xmath118 ) should have formed in the range of @xmath119 ( parallelogram abcd in figure  [ fig2]a ) .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath120 , the growth rate of clusters decreases and cluster formation gradually ceases at @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "thus , in figure  [ fig2]b , cluster data are expected to be distributed between the points of @xmath122 ( segment ab ) and @xmath123 ( segment cd ) and should have a two - dimensional distribution ( parallelogram abcd ) .",
    "thus , compared with the observations , the models in figure  [ fig2 ] show that @xmath124 kev and @xmath125 are preferred .",
    "the latter result is quite consistent with that of paper ii , where we found that the @xmath126 relation suggests @xmath125 .",
    "since @xmath18 is related to @xmath4 by equation ( [ eq : beta3 ] ) , the @xmath95 relation is equivalent to the @xmath126 relation for a fixed value of @xmath71 . note that in figure  [ fig2 ] predicted regions corresponding to different @xmath71 overlap each other ; this implies that the position of a cluster in figure  [ fig2 ] does not uniquely correspond to @xmath71 in contrast to figure  [ fig1 ] . for a given @xmath18 and @xmath26 , larger @xmath71 corresponds to larger @xmath58 or larger amplitude of the initial fluctuation .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath71 appears to be caused by gravitational heating in subclusters that are to merge to the cluster ( @xmath127 kev ) at the time of the cluster formation .",
    "in fact , figure  [ fig2]b shows that observed clusters are situated close to the line of @xmath128 ( arc ad ) when @xmath129 kev , while they are situated close to the line of @xmath130 ( arc bc ) when @xmath131 kev .",
    "moreover , figure  [ fig1 ] suggests that clusters with large @xmath4 favor large @xmath71",
    ". these may reflect that clusters with larger ( smaller ) @xmath58 or @xmath4 tend to have more ( less ) massive progenitors with larger ( smaller ) @xmath71 , although these are only loose tendencies , and we need more samples and more improved models to obtain a definite conclusion .    note that gravitational heating in subclusters itself is a self - similar process and does not modify self - similar scaling relations such as the luminosity - temperature relation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , an additional entropy other than expected from purely gravitational assembly of a cluster must be injected into the gas .",
    "@xcite investigate the entropy evolution of intergalactic medium ( igm ) and find that clusters with @xmath132 kev are affected by the additional entropy when it is generated by quasar heating .",
    "this is because the additional entropy is comparable to the entropy generated by gravitational collapse of the clusters .",
    "in other words , the adiabatic compression of the gas from the preheated igm alone can heat the gas up to @xmath133 kev .",
    "therefore , in addition to the gravitational processes in subclusters , the preheating may significantly contribute to @xmath71 , and the lower bound of which is given by @xmath134 .",
    "if @xmath133 kev , this is consistent with our result ( figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "@xcite also investigate the case when only supernova heating is taken into account and quasar heating is ignored .",
    "the result is @xmath135 kev . in this case , and effects of the preheating is small and we expect that @xmath18 does not much depend on @xmath4 and @xmath26 , although @xmath18 would have a scatter owing to the difference of merging history .",
    "this is inconsistent with the observations .",
    "the insufficient power of the supernova heating is also suggested by @xcite ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "another possible source of heating is that due to shocks forming at higher redshift on the largest scales , such as filaments and sheets .",
    "@xcite indicate that most of baryons at low redshift should have a temperature in the range of @xmath136 k. the relatively large value of @xmath71 may reflect this temperature .",
    "we also investigate the case of @xmath137 and @xmath138 , which are presented in figure  [ fig3 ] . in this case ,",
    "the model of @xmath101 kev is preferred especially for the data obtained by @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath66 and @xmath71 are correlated and they can not be determined independently .",
    "however , the model of @xmath139 is inappropriate because @xmath140 exceeds unity for some observational data while relation ( [ eq : beta2 ] ) or ( [ eq : beta3 ] ) limits @xmath18 to less than one .",
    "if a cluster is not isothermal , the temperature in the central region @xmath4 should be larger than @xmath72 @xcite . in this case",
    ", the discrepancy between the model and the observations is more significant .",
    "thus , it seems to be difficult to construct a model that predicts @xmath141 .",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether the gas distribution in clusters derived above is consistent with the observations of central gas fraction , and the fundamental band and plane we found in paper  i. the shapes of the band and plane are also related to the origin of the observed relation of @xmath142 ( paper  i ) .",
    "we did not explore the origin of the variation of the central gas mass fraction in previous papers , where @xmath20 was regarded as constant .",
    "below , we will show that this is related to the variation of @xmath18 .    from relation ( [ eq : beta ] ) , the gas density at the cluster core is approximately given by @xmath143 where @xmath70 and @xmath144 are functions of @xmath6 and @xmath58 (  [ sec : model ] ) , and @xmath145 is the gas density at radius @xmath75 from the cluster center .",
    "we assume that the profile of dark matter is isothermal ( @xmath146 ) at least for @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "moreover , we assume that the average gas fraction within radius @xmath70 is @xmath149 regardless of @xmath6 and @xmath91 .",
    "the value of @xmath150 is nearly the largest gas mass fraction of observed clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) . on these assumptions , the central gas density and the gas fraction at the cluster core",
    "are respectively given by @xmath151 and @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the gas fraction at the cluster center .",
    "the above equations are valid when @xmath154 .",
    "note that in paper  ii , we derive the central gas density according to the relation @xmath155 , in which @xmath156 is differently determined by the observations and did not take account of the variation of @xmath20 when we derive @xmath156 from observations of @xmath11 , @xmath26 , and @xmath4 . ] .",
    "in contrast , in equation ( [ eq : rho_0 ] ) , we derive @xmath11 assuming that @xmath157 .",
    "the above model values ( equation [ [ eq : rho_0 ] ] or [ [ eq : frac ] ] ) can be obtained from observational data . using equations ( [ eq : rad ] ) , ( [ eq : temp ] ) , and ( [ eq : beta_beta ] ) we obtain @xmath158 where we used the relations of @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "thus , using equation ( [ eq : beta_beta ] ) , the right hand of equation ( [ eq : rho_0 ] ) should be written as @xmath161 hence , @xmath162 can be derived from the observable quantities @xmath26 , @xmath4 , and @xmath20 .",
    "figure  [ rhorho ] displays a plot of @xmath11 and @xmath162 based on the data obtained by @xcite .",
    "note that @xcite do not present @xmath163 .",
    "we do not show the uncertainties of @xmath164 to avoid complexity .",
    "here we use only @xmath11 corresponding to the global cluster component as we did in paper  i.    figure  [ rhorho ] shows that @xmath11 well agrees with @xmath162 although @xmath11 is slightly smaller than @xmath162 for clusters with large @xmath162 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the variation of @xmath156 is due to that of the slope parameter of the gas distribution @xmath18 within @xmath70 .",
    "one possible reason for the slight disagreement between @xmath162 and @xmath11 is an uncertainty of the value of @xmath165 .",
    "another is the influence of central excess emission of clusters .",
    "when the distance to a cluster is relatively large , the center and global surface brightness components may not be distinguished even if the two components exist . in this case",
    ", the cluster may be considered that it has only a global component . however , when the central emission is strong , the fitting of the surface brightness profile by one component may be affected by the central emission and may give a smaller core radius than the real .",
    "this may make @xmath166 large for the clusters .",
    "in fact , clusters with @xmath167 are regarded by @xcite as having only one ( global ) component of surface brightness .",
    "note that core radii derived by @xcite may be less affected by the central emission because they take account of cooling flows and the gravitation of central cluster galaxies , which are responsible for the central emission , for _ all _ clusters they investigate ( figures [ fig2 ] and [ fb]b ) .",
    "we present the theoretically predicted relations among @xmath163 , @xmath70 , and @xmath4 in figure  [ fb ] .",
    "although these relations are presented in paper  ii using the observed relation between @xmath156 and @xmath15 , here we plot them by directly using @xmath18 . for lines in figure  [ fb ]",
    ", we use the relation @xmath168 . for comparison",
    ", we plot the observational data in the catalogue of @xcite and @xcite . for the data",
    ", we use the relation @xmath169 .",
    "figure  [ fb ] shows that our model can well reproduce the band distribution of observational data in the ( @xmath170)-space .",
    "moreover , our model can explain the planar distribution of the observational data . in paper",
    "i , we find that the observational data satisfy the relation of the fundamental plane , @xmath171 .",
    "for @xmath172 and @xmath173 , our model with @xmath138 and @xmath174 kev predicts the plane of @xmath175 , which is approximately consistent with the observation .",
    "note that the index of @xmath163 is somewhat smaller than the observed value considering the uncertainty ( @xmath176 ) , which may be related to the slight disagreement between @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( figure  [ rhorho ] ) .",
    "the plane is represented by the two parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath58 , as discussed in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "since the cross section of the fundamental plane corresponds to the observed @xmath29 relation , and the fundamental plane corresponds to the observed dependence of @xmath177 on @xmath12 and @xmath15 ( paper  i ) , our model can also reproduce these relations .",
    "these results strengthen our interpretation that the difference of gas distribution among clusters is caused by heating of the gas before the cluster collapse and by shock heating at the time of the cluster collapse ( equation [ [ eq : beta2 ] ] or [ [ eq : beta3 ] ] ) .",
    "we have investigated the influence of heating before cluster collapse and shocks during cluster formation on the gas distribution in the central region of clusters of galaxies .",
    "we assumed that the core structure has not much changed since the formation of a cluster . using a spherical collapse model of a dark halo and a simple shock model",
    ", we predict the relations among the slope of gas distribution @xmath18 , the gas temperature @xmath4 , and the core radius @xmath26 of clusters . by comparing them with observations of relatively hot ( @xmath0 kev ) and low redshift clusters ,",
    "we find that the temperature of the preheated gas collapsed into the clusters is about @xmath178 kev .",
    "since the temperature is higher than that predicted by a preheating model of supernovae , it may reflect the heating by quasars or gravitational heating on the largest scales at high redshift . moreover , gravitational heating in subclusters assembled when the clusters formed also seems to affect the temperature of the preheated gas and produce the dispersion in the preheating temperature .",
    "assuming that the global gas mass fraction of clusters are constant , we predict that the gas mass fraction in the core region of clusters should vary correlating with @xmath18 through a simple law , which is shown to be consistent with the observations .",
    "thus , we conclude that the variation of the gas mass fraction in the cluster core is due to the shock heating of preheated gas .",
    "furthermore , we have confirmed that the observed fundamental plane and band of clusters are reproduced by the model even when the effects of preheating are taken into account .",
    "thus , major conclusions about the cluster formation and cosmology obtained in our previous papers are not changed ."

    "<S> as is suggested by our previous work , we assume that the core structure of clusters determined at the cluster collapse has not been much changed after that . the adopted model supposes that the gas distribution characterized by the slope parameter is related to the preheated temperature . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with observations of relatively hot ( @xmath0 kev ) and low redshift clusters suggests that the preheated temperature is about 0.5 - 2 kev , which is higher than expected from the conventional galactic wind model and possibly suggests the need for additional heating such as quasars or gravitational heating on the largest scales at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion of the preheated temperature may be attributed to the gravitational heating in subclusters . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the central gas fraction of a cluster from the gas distribution , assuming that the global gas mass fraction is constant within a virial radius at the time of the cluster collapse . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the central gas density thus calculated is in good agreement with the observed one , which suggests that the variation of gas mass fraction in cluster cores appears to be explained by breaking the self - similarity in clusters due to preheated gas . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that this model does not change major conclusions on the fundamental plane and its cosmological implications obtained in previous papers , which strongly suggests that not only for the dark halo but also for the intracluster gas the core structure preserves information about the cluster formation . </S>"
