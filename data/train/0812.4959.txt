    "are those involving electric fields , in particular searches for the parity and time - reversal violating permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the electron @xmath9 .",
    "there were , in fact , a series of experimental searches for the electron edm @xcite carried out at the university of washington using alkali atoms contained in paraffin - coated cells during the 1960 s and early 1970 s that set a limit of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these experiments were limited by a systematic effect involving an alteration of the cell properties due to application of the electric fields .",
    "subsequent electron edm searches using other methods have far surpassed this level of sensitivity , with the latest effort employing a thallium atomic beam resulting in a limit of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , recent developments indicated that an electron edm search employing paraffin - coated cells may , after all , be able to offer some hope of competing with the latest generation of edm experiments . combining state - of - the - art paraffin - coated cell technology @xcite with the use of nonlinear optical rotation for detection of spin precession @xcite , and assuming that an electric field of @xmath12 can be applied to cesium atoms contained in a paraffin - coated cell , one obtains an estimate for the shot - noise - limited statistical sensitivity of such an experiment to the electron edm of @xmath13 @xcite ( taking into account the factor of 120 enhancement of the cs edm relative to the electron edm @xcite )",
    ". motivated by this possibility , we initiated a study of the application of electric fields to paraffin - coated cells .",
    "unexpectedly , we discovered a dramatic effect of the electric field on the alkali vapor density in paraffin - coated cells @xcite .",
    "for sufficiently large electric fields , when the electric field magnitude was altered or if its polarity was reversed , we observed a significant and rapid ( time scale @xmath14 ) increase in the alkali vapor density , then a significant and rapid ( time scale @xmath15 ) decrease in the vapor density ( well below the initial equilibrium density ) , followed by a relatively slow ( time scale on the order of 100  s ) return to roughly the initial vapor density .",
    "experiments performed with uncoated vapor cells showed no such effects , so the behavior is attributed to the paraffin coating .    in this paper",
    "we report on a series of experiments performed to characterize this phenomenon and study its dependence on electric field magnitude , cell temperature , and cell history .",
    "this paper combines complementary sets of data taken using different experimental setups , procedures , geometries , cells , and atoms at three different institutions : california state university - east bay ( csu - eb ) , the raman research institute ( rri ) , and the university of california at berkeley ( ucb ) .",
    "we will begin by describing the experimental setups and the data acquired at each of the institutions , and then discuss possible interpretations of the results and physical mechanisms for the phenomenon .",
    "we demonstrate that the most important property of the paraffin - coated cell , its ability to significantly reduce the relaxation rate of ground - state atomic coherences , is largely unaffected by the application of electric fields .",
    "the phenomenon can be described using a rate equation model introduced previously @xcite to understand the phenomenon of light - induced atomic desorption ( liad ) from paraffin .",
    "although electric - field - induced density changes have been observed in several different paraffin - coated cells and all paraffin - coated cells tested , it is possible that there may be cell - to - cell variation . note that it is possible that details of the effect depend on the cell preparation procedure , which for the cells employed in the described experiments is discussed in ref .  @xcite .",

    "the cells were evacuated to @xmath16 at the time of manufacturing and do not contain any buffer gas .",
    "the cs vapor density was monitored by measuring absorption spectra of light resonant with the d2 ( 852 nm ) line .",
    "the light was generated by a vertical - cavity surface emitting laser ( vcsel ) and the light frequency was scanned over 10 ghz to cover the entire hyperfine structure by modulating the current of the vcsel with a triangular waveform .",
    "the intensity of the light was maintained below @xmath17 with use of neutral density filters in order to minimize distortion of the lineshape due to optical pumping ( optical pumping effects can be important even at low light powers in paraffin - coated cells because of the long lifetime of ground - state coherences ) .",
    "transmitted light power was detected by a photodiode fitted with an interference filter ( peak transmission at @xmath18 with a @xmath19 bandpass ) to reduce background noise from stray light .",
    "the photodiode was connected to a current pre - amplifier and the output was recorded by a digital oscilloscope .",
    "every five seconds an oscilloscope trace was transferred to a computer where the data were fit in real time to an absorption spectrum based on the voigt profile in order to extract the cs vapor density .",

    "experiments reported previously @xcite used electro - optic effects to verify that the applied electric field was present inside the volume of the cell with the correct magnitude ( measurement accuracy was within a factor of two ) .",
    "the temperature of the cell was controlled by blowing heated or cooled air into the electrode assembly through the port for temperature control ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hv electrodes ] ) . in some experiments",
    ", we also independently controlled the temperature of the cell stem by blowing heated or cooled air directly onto the stem while the rest of the cell remained at room temperature ( @xmath20c ) .",
    "the external flat faces of the cell were coated with silver paint and a thin layer of conductive silicone ( cho - bond 1038 ) was affixed to the surfaces of the electrode plates to ensure good electrical contact between the plates and the outer surface of the cell .",
    "two different cells of nearly identical geometry manufactured at the same time were employed in these experiments , with nearly identical results . during the experiments , the laboratory magnetic field was uncontrolled , and has since been measured to be of typical magnitude @xmath21 . during the experiments , the orientation of the setup was changed from time - to - time relative to the laboratory magnetic field with no noticeable change in the experimental results .",
    "note that the dc stark shift of the optical transition frequency does not affect the determination of vapor density in the present scheme since we fit the entire doppler - broadened absorption spectrum .",
    "furthermore , even at the highest electric field magnitudes , the dc stark shift of the optical transition frequency ( @xmath22 , see refs .",

    "when the electric field polarity is switched , at first there is a rapid increase in cs vapor density with a time scale of @xmath24  1  s , which we term the `` burst '' of cs vapor density . although the speed of the data acquisition in the experimental setup at csu - eb was too slow to reliably capture the details of the cs vapor burst , the experiments conducted at rri with rb are able to probe these relatively fast dynamics , so we defer detailed discussion of the burst until later .",

    "this general decline of the equilibrium vapor density was consistently observed as the field polarity was repeatedly switched .",
    "full recovery could take up to over an hour , as will be discussed in some detail below . due to the limitations of our present data acquisition system , the experiments at csu - eb focused primarily on the character of the drop in cs vapor density .",
    "it is also of interest to note that , as has been commonly observed in paraffin - coated alkali vapor cells ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the equilibrium cs vapor density prior to application of the electric field in both cells at room temperature ( 20@xmath29c ) was @xmath30 50% lower than the saturated vapor density for cs of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this suppression of the alkali vapor densities has generally been attributed to the continuous adsorption of atoms into the paraffin coating @xcite .",

    "[ fig : density_efield_timeplots_20c ] are in sequential order from top to bottom , so that the electric field in each plot begins at the value where the field ends in the plot above .",
    "in addition to the systematic drop in density upon polarity reversals for fields above @xmath32 , one can also observe similar , but slightly smaller , changes in the cs vapor density at the start of each sequence when the electric field magnitude was changed .",
    "a general decline in the equilibrium cs vapor density @xmath26 prior to a particular polarity reversal can be seen as the experimental run continues ( especially pronounced for the data at @xmath33 ) , indicating that the cell did not fully recover to its initial state between polarity reversals .",
    "nonetheless , the properties of the drop can be characterized in terms of the change in vapor density @xmath34 from its value @xmath26 before a polarity reversal to after the reversal , as well as the fractional change in density @xmath35 .",
    "although data acquisition is too slow to reliably capture the brief but significant increase ( burst ) in atomic density when the field is switched , however the burst is captured at @xmath36 for the 2  kv / cm data and at @xmath37 for the 4  kv / cm data .",

    "it is of interest to note that at 1  kv / cm there is minimal change in cs vapor density , whereas a significant drop is observed for polarity reversals at 2  kv / cm , possibly indicating a threshold for the effect , or at least a nonlinear increase in the effect for electric field magnitudes between 0  2  @xmath39 .",

    "it is of interest to note that although the initial equilibrium cs vapor density prior to application of the electric field changes by a factor of three between the lowest temperature and the highest temperature studied , @xmath34 is nearly the same for all the studied temperatures .",
    "also , it is important to note that at the highest electric field magnitudes , @xmath34 is approaching the initial density in the cell ( @xmath35 is approaching 1 , a 100% drop in density ) , so the linear trend observed in the data can not continue for significantly higher electric field magnitudes .",
    "we also performed experiments in which the stem of the cell was locally heated ( up to @xmath40c ) while the rest of the cell was maintained at a temperature of @xmath41c , which gave nearly the same results for @xmath34 as experiments in which the entire cell was heated .",
    "heating the stem of the cell produced approximately the same vapor density in the cell as heating the whole cell , a consequence of the equilibrium reached between the alkali atoms from the stem and relatively slow and continuous adsorption of alkali atoms into the paraffin coating , observed in several previous studies @xcite .",
    "( it is generally inadvisable to overheat the stem relative to the cell volume for extended periods of time , as this has been observed to degrade the relaxation properties of the paraffin coating by creating alkali metal deposits on the inner surface of the cell that act as relaxation sites @xcite . in our case , the stem was heated by no more than @xmath42c for only a few hours and there was no evidence of coating degradation after the experiment . ) the invariance of @xmath34 with respect to the alkali vapor density and the temperature of the cell suggest that the physical origin of the phenomenon is related to some property of the paraffin coating that is independent of both experimental parameters over the studied range .    in addition , we analyzed the time constant for recovery from the drop of cs vapor density ( taken to be the time for density to reach @xmath43 after a polarity reversal ) as a function of all the varied experimental parameters : electric field magnitude , cell temperature ( cs vapor density ) , etc .",

    "we observed a `` hysteresis '' effect in the fractional density change : the threshold for the appearance of the density drop is moved to a higher field magnitude for the run for which field magnitude was sequentially decreased .",

    "after this there is no significant change in density .",
    "however , for delay times @xmath49 , the usual drop in density is observed for every polarity reversal .",
    "this indicates a paraffin - coated cell can , for a time , be `` conditioned '' to allow field reversals without the usual drop in density , at least for electric field magnitudes in the neighborhood of the threshold field magnitude of @xmath50 .",
    "this technique of pre - conditioning offers a possibility of conducting electric - field - related experiments with paraffin - coated cells while maintaining a relatively constant alkali vapor density .",
    "the experiments discussed above provoke the questions of whether the observed effects are specific to cesium atoms or even whether the phenomenon is specific to the particular paraffin - coated vapor cells used .",
    "although there are established techniques to reliably produce high - quality paraffin - coated cells , there can be variations in the properties of paraffin - coated cells linked to details of their preparation and history .",
    "for example , in some cells needle - like alkali metal crystals of lengths up to 3 mm have been observed to grow from the paraffin coating @xcite ( no such needles have been observed in the cells used in the present study ) . therefore it is of interest to study the application of electric fields to other paraffin - coated cells containing different atoms and using different experimental procedures to assess the generality of the phenomenon of electric - field - induced density changes .",
    "such experiments were carried out at rri with a paraffin - coated rubidium vapor cell ( containing an isotopically enriched sample of @xmath51rb ) of similar size and shape as the cells used in the experiments with cs at csu - eb .",
    "since the alkali atoms used , the electric field plate geometry employed , and the details of the experimental method all differ from the experiments with cs carried out at csu - eb , the two sets of experiments offer independent measurements of the effect .",
    "indeed an electric - field - induced change in the alkali vapor density , qualitatively similar to the csu - eb results discussed above , was observed in the rb cells .",
    "furthermore , the experimental approach at rri enabled reliable measurement of the alkali atom `` burst '' occurring at the outset of an abrupt change of the electric field magnitude , allowing additional details of the effect to be studied .      the experimental setup for the rri measurements is shown in fig .",

    "the results of the experiments suggest that the observed electric - field - induced change in alkali vapor density in paraffin - coated cells is related to an electric - field - induced alteration of the properties of the paraffin coating .",
    "since the electric - field - induced changes in rb and cs vapor density are observed in paraffin - coated cells but not in uncoated cells , the effect must be related to the presence of the paraffin coating .",

    "[ fig : density_efield_timeplots_delay ] ) are too long to be associated with a purely gas - phase interaction  there must be some relatively long - term modification of the paraffin .",
    "a striking characteristic of both the burst and the drop in alkali vapor density induced by the electric field is the characteristic `` threshold '' for the effect ( or , at least , a nonlinear dependence on electric field magnitude of the amplitude of the burst and drop in vapor density in the @xmath78 range ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : density_efield_timeplots_20c ] , [ fig : densitychange_vs_efield ] , [ fig : fractionaldensitychange_vs_efield_rev ] , [ fig : rri - transient - on ] , and [ fig : rri - transient - off ] demonstrate that significant changes in alkali vapor density only occur for field magnitudes above @xmath79 .",
    "note that the experiments demonstrate that the threshold is essentially independent of temperature ( in the range @xmath80c - @xmath81c ) , alkali vapor density ( in the range @xmath82 - @xmath83 ) , and species of alkali atom ( the threshold is similar for both rb and cs ) . the electric - field - magnitude threshold is evident for both the burst and drop in alkali vapor density ( figs .",
    "[ fig : rri - transient - on ] and [ fig : rri - transient - off ] ) .",
    "the accumulated evidence indicates that the electric - field - induced change in alkali vapor density is caused by an alteration of the paraffin coating by the electric field , an alteration which has little to do with the density of alkali atoms in the cell .",
    "perhaps the effect is due to a physical restructuring of the arrangement of paraffin molecules in the coating by the electric field . in the absence of an electric field , the paraffin molecules ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ) are attracted to one another by van der waals forces and",
    "form a tangled web on the glass surface .",
    "although rough estimates based on the surface tension and polarizability of paraffin @xcite suggest that physical alteration of the paraffin coating is minimal over the studied range of electric field magnitudes , it may be possible that a small subset of weakly bound paraffin molecules begin to alter their configuration as the field magnitudes exceed the threshold value .",
    "but why would a physical restructuring of the paraffin coating affect the vapor density in the cell ? experiments using light to desorb alkali atoms from paraffin coatings @xcite have demonstrated that in paraffin - coated vapor cells a relatively large population of alkali atoms are adsorbed into the paraffin coating and are weakly bound to the paraffin molecules .",
    "if the electric field physically restructures the coating , atoms previously trapped in the coating can be released , causing the burst in vapor density , and new binding sites for alkali atoms can be created , leading to the subsequent drop in vapor density .",
    "in addition to the various lengths of the paraffin molecules , for which the surface tension and polarizibilities will be different , it is likely that there is considerable variation in binding energy of paraffin molecules due to their different locations and arrangements in the coating .",
    "thus it would seem plausible that once the threshold field magnitude is crossed , as the field magnitude is further increased a greater number of paraffin molecules will be re - oriented when the field is changed .",
    "this offers an explanation for why the amplitude of the vapor density change increases as the field magnitude is increased past the threshold : larger electric field magnitudes lead to more re - oriented paraffin molecules , which in turn leads to more alkali atoms released from old binding sites and more new binding sites opening up .    in further support of this crude model",
    ", we note that the amplitude @xmath34 of the electric - field - induced drop in vapor density is independent of the initial vapor density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : densitychange_vs_efield ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the appearance new binding sites in the paraffin coating , the number of which is unrelated to the equilibrium vapor density .",
    "lastly , the curious hysteresis behavior shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fractionaldensitychange_vs_efield_rev ] and [ fig : density_efield_timeplots_delay ] is indicative of a physical restructuring of the paraffin coating that persists even once the electric field is set to zero , with a very slow relaxation back to a configuration similar to its initial configuration .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that paraffin can exhibit electret behavior , persistent polarization even in zero electric field .",
    "the hysteresis effects observed could be connected to such persistent `` electret '' polarization .",
    "this mechanism of restructuring paraffin with electric fields resulting in creation and passivation of binding sites for alkali atomic vapor offers a consistent mechanism for the effects seen with both the dipolar and the monopolar switching of the electric field .",
    "it is also consistent with the observation of the burst and drop when the electric field is switched off in the experiments with rb .",
    "it is also important to note that different dynamic behavior is likely in paraffin with bipolar and monopolar switching .",
    "this could directly affect the number density of binding sites created , a fact that could explain the relative difference in the magnitude of the effect between the cs and rb experiments .    however , the model as presented is based on qualitative rather than quantitative features of the experimental observations , so further experimental and theoretical study is necessary to determine if this model is a viable explanation .",
    "further investigation might include experiments with different alkali atoms , other types of coatings , and possibly using light - induced atomic desorption ( liad ) @xcite in conjunction with electric fields to study the relationship between the effects .",
    "another important question left unanswered by the present set of experiments is the role , if any , of the rate of change of the electric field magnitude and direction .",
    "the present experimental setup did not offer a convenient method of controlling the rate of change of the electric field @xmath84 , but we hope to explore the dependence of the burst and drop in alkali density on @xmath84 as part of future work on this phenomenon .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , a phenomenological rate equation model describing the adsorption and desorption of alkali atoms from paraffin coatings was introduced to describe the change in alkali vapor density in paraffin - coated vapor cells exposed to light .",

    "the basic dynamics of the electric - field - induced alkali vapor density changes observed in the present experiments can also be described by this model , offering a glimpse at the essential features of an explanation of the phenomenon .",
    "based on accumulated evidence @xcite , it is known that to describe changes in alkali vapor density @xmath85 in paraffin coated cells , alkali atoms in three regions must be considered : the stem , the volume of the cell , and the paraffin coating .",
    "we assume that the vapor density in the stem of the cell , @xmath86 , is constant , and that there is an exchange rate between the stem and the volume of the cell described by a constant @xmath87 ( which has units of @xmath88 ) .",
    "it is known that the paraffin coating adsorbs and desorbs alkali atoms : the flux of atoms from the coating is @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the number of atoms in the coating , and the flux of atoms adsorbed into the coating is given by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the probability of an atom being adsorbed into the coating , @xmath93 is the average velocity of the atoms , and @xmath94 is the surface area of the paraffin coating .",
    "the probability of adsorption into the coating @xmath92 is assumed to be determined by the population of sites on the coating surface that are favorable for creating quasi - molecular bonds .",
    "the atoms in the coating are irreversibly lost at a rate of @xmath95 via diffusion to the glass walls or possibly chemical reactions with impurities in the coating .",
    "the rate equations describing the atoms in the cell with the electric field turned off are @xmath96    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rateeqns ] ) , the initial density in the cell @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 and the initial number of atoms in the coating is @xmath99    our present experiments suggest that the change in alkali vapor density may be caused by the electric field physically restructuring the paraffin coating .",
    "sites on the coating surface that previously bound atoms no longer bind the atoms , so the atoms are released causing the `` burst '' in density .",
    "the restructuring causes new binding sites to appear , leading to the subsequent `` drop '' in vapor density .",
    "the greater the restructuring of the coating , the greater the alteration of binding sites , leading to the dependence of the phenomenon on the electric field magnitude .",
    "we can model these effects using the rate equations by introducing a temporary increase in both the adsorption probability @xmath92 and the desorption rate @xmath100 when the electric field magnitude or direction is changed .",
    "( although it is entirely possible that the change of paraffin properties in not uniformly distributed over the coating , one can think of @xmath92 and @xmath100 as average values for the entire coating . )",

    "the recovery of the alkali vapor density to its equilibrium value is primarily determined by the replenishing of the atoms in the cell by the metal drop in the stem , much as is the case for liad @xcite , and thus the time scale of this recovery is unrelated to the electric - field - induced modification of the paraffin coating .",

    "[ fig : atomsincoating ] , the time scale for recovery of the number of atoms in the coating is considerably longer than the time scale for recovery of the atomic vapor density , since the coating must refill through the relatively slow process of adsorption into the coating whereas the vapor density recovers on the considerably faster time scale set by the exchange of atoms between the cell volume and the stem . also of note is the fact that the phenomenon can be explained through rather brief ( time constants @xmath15 ) modification of the coating properties : vapor density changes persist for considerably longer periods of time because of the slow dynamics of re - equilibration of alkali atom population in the stem , coating , and volume of the cell .",
