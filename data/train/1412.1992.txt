    "strongly collimated jets represent one of the most visible signs of the activity of compact astrophysical sources . they are observed both in relativistic objects such as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and microquasars , and in young stars where the motion of matter is definitely nonrelativistic .",
    "this implies that we are dealing with some universal and extremely efficient mechanism of energy release .    at present the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model of activity of compact objects",
    "is accepted by most astrophysicists  @xcite . at the heart of the mhd approach",
    "lies the model of the unipolar inductor , i.e. , a rotating source of direct current .",
    "it is believed that the electromagnetic energy flux  the poynting flux  plays the main role in the energy transfer from the ` central engine ' to active regions .",
    "the conditions for the existence of such a ` central engine ' are satisfied in all the compact sources mentioned above .",
    "indeed , all compact sources are assumed to harbor a rapidly spinning central body ( black hole , neutron star , or young star ) and some regular magnetic field , which leads to the emergence of strong induction electric fields .",
    "the electric fields , in turn , lead to the appearance of longitudinal electric currents resulting in effective energy losses and particle acceleration .",
    "the first studies of the electromagnetic model of compact sources ( namely , radio pulsars ) were carried out as early as the end of the 1960s  @xcite .",
    "it was evidenced that there are objects in the universe in which electrodynamical processes can play the decisive role in the energy release .",
    "then ,  @xcite and  @xcite independently suggested that the same mechanism can also operate in active galactic nuclei , and for nearly 40 years this model has remained the leading one .",
    "remember that within the mhd approach the total energy losses @xmath6 can be easily evaluated as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the total electric current flowing along the jet , and is the electro - motive force exerted on the black hole on the scale @xmath9 .",
    "if the central engine ( black hole for agns ) rotates withthe angular velocity @xmath10 in the external magnetic field @xmath11 , one can evaluate the electric field as on the other hand , assuming that for agns the current density @xmath12 is fully determined by the relativistic outflow of the goldreich - julian charge density @xmath13 ( i.e. , the minimum charge density required for the screening of the longitudinal electric field in the magnetosphere ) , one can write down @xmath14",
    ". it gives @xmath15 as for agns , one can set @xmath16 to obtain the well - known evaluation  @xcite @xmath17 in particular , comparing expressions ( [ iev ] ) and ( [ pjetev ] ) , one can straightforwardly obtain @xmath18 for agns it corresponds to @xmath19@xmath20  a. certainly , the question as to whether it is possible to consider a black hole immersed in an external magnetic field as a unipolar inductor turned out to be also rather nontrivial @xcite .    as a result",
    ", the mhd model was successfully used to describe a lot of processes in active nuclei including the problem of the stability of jets   and their synchrotron radiation  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown both analytically  @xcite and numerically @xcite that for sufficiently small ambient pressure the dense core can be formed .",
    "this is related both to advances in the theory which have at last formulated sufficiently simple analytical relations  @xcite , and to the breakthrough in numerical simulations  @xcite which confirmed theoretical predictions .",
    "moreover , recently  @xcite demonstrated that in qso 3c303 the jet does possess large enough toroidal magnetic field , the apropriate longitudinal electric current along the jet @xmath21  a being as large as the electric current @xmath22 ( eq .  [ igj ] ) which is necessary to support the poynting energy flux .",
    "besides , the lack of @xmath23-ray radiation as probed by the _ fermi _",
    "observatory for agn jets observed at small enough viewing angles @xmath24  @xcite can be easily explained as well .",
    "indeed , as was found ( see , e.g. , beskin 2010 ) , within well - collimated magnetically dominated mhd jets the lorentz factors of the particle bulk motion can be evaluated as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the distance from the jet axis , and @xmath27 is the light cylinder radius .",
    "thus , the energy of particles radiating in small enough angles @xmath28 with respect to the jet axis is to be much smaller than that corresponding to peripheral parts of a jet .",
    "the most important mhd parameters describing relativistic flows ( which was originally introduced for radio pulsars ) are the michel magnetization parameter @xmath29 and the multiplicity parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the first one determines the maximum possible bulk lorentz factor @xmath5 of the flow when all the energy transported by the poynting flux is transmitted to particles .",
    "the second one is the dimensionless multiplicity parameter @xmath31 , which is defined as the ratio of the number density @xmath32 to the goldrech - julian ( gj ) number density @xmath33 .",
    "it is important that these two parameters are connected by the simple relation  @xcite @xmath34 here @xmath35  erg / s is the minimum energy losses of the central engine which can accelerate particles to relativistic energies , and @xmath6 is the total energy losses of the compact object .",
    "unfortunately , up to now neither the magnetization nor the multiplicity parameters were actually known as the observations could not give us the direct information about the number density and bulk energy of particles .",
    "the core shift method has been applied to obtain the concentration @xmath32 , magnetic field @xmath36  @xcite , and the jet composition @xcite in agn jets .",
    "however , evaluation of multiplicity and michel magnetization parameters , which needs to estimate the total jet power , has not been done . from a theoretical point of view",
    "if the inner parts of the accretiondisc are hot enough , then electron - positron pairs can be produced by two - photon collisions , where photons with sufficient energy originate from the inner parts of the accretion disk  @xcite . in this case and",
    "michel magnetization parameter @xmath37@xmath38 .",
    "the second model takes into account the appearance of the region where the gj plasma density is equal to zero due to general relativity effects that corresponds to the outer gap in the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "this model gives @xmath39@xmath38 , and @xmath40@xmath41 .",
    "this large difference in the estimates for the magnetization parameter @xmath29 leads to two completely different pictures of the flow structure in jets .",
    "in particular , it determines whether the flow is magnetically or particle dominated .",
    "the point is that for ordinary jets @xmath42@xmath43 . as a result , using the universal asymptotic solution @xmath44 ( [ gamma ] ) , one can obtain that the values @xmath37@xmath38 correspond to the saturation regime when almost all the poynting flux @xmath45 is transmitted to the particle kinetic energy flux @xmath46 . on the other hand , for @xmath47 the jet remains magnetically dominated ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "thus , the determination of michel magnetization parameter @xmath29 is the key point in the analysis of the internal structure of relativistic jets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : multi ] it is shown that vlbi observations of synchrotron self - absorbtion in agn jets allow us to evaluate the number density of the outflowing plasma @xmath32 and , hence , the multiplicity parameter @xmath30 .",
    "we discuss the source sample and present the result for multiplicity and michel magnetization mparameters in section  [ s : calculation ] .",
    "the values @xmath49 obtained from the analysis of 97 sources shows that for most jets the magnetization parameter @xmath50 .",
    "since the magnetization parameter is the maximum possible value of the lorentz factor of the relativistic bulk flow , this estimate is consistent with observed superluminal motion.in section  [ s : struct ] it is shown that for physical parameters determined above , the poloidal magnetic field and particle number density are much larger in the center of the jet than near its boundary . finally , in section  [ s : connect ] the casual connectivity of strongly collimated supersonic jets is discussed . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the @xmath51cdm cosmological model with @xmath52  km  s@xmath53  mpc@xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "to determine the multiplicity parameter @xmath30 and michel magnetization parameter @xmath29 one can use the dependence on the visible position of the core of the jet from the observation frequency  @xcite .",
    "this effect is associated with the absorption of the synchrotron photon gas by relativistic electrons ( positrons ) in a jet .",
    "typically , the parsec - scale radio morphology of a bright agn manifests a one - sided jet structure due to doppler boosting that enhances the emission of the approaching jet .",
    "the apparent base of the jet is commonly called the `` core '' , and it is often the brightest and most compact feature in vlbi images of agn .",
    "the vlbi core is thought to represent the jet region where the optical depth is equal to unity .",
    "we will employ the following model to connect the physical parameters at the jet launching region with the observable core - shift .",
    "there is a magnetohydrodynamic relativistic outflow of non - emitting plasma moving with bulk lorentz factor @xmath5 and concentration @xmath32 in the observer rest frame . on the latter we superimpose the flow of emitting particles with distribution @xmath56 ,",
    "@xmath57 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath58 is concentration of emitting plasma , @xmath59 is concentration aplitude , and @xmath60 is the emitting particles lorentz factor .",
    "all the parameters with subscript ` * ' are taken in the non - emitting plasma rest frame , i.e. , in the frame which locally moves with the bulk lorentz factor @xmath5 .",
    "we suppose that the emitting particles radiate synchrotron photons in the jet s magnetic field , and these photons scatter off the same electrons , which lead to the photon absorption @xcite .",
    "the corresponding turn - over frequency @xmath61 , the frequency at which the flux density @xmath62 has a maximum , can be evaluated using expressions from @xcite as @xmath63 the function @xmath64 is a composition of gamma - functions defined by @xcite , and for @xmath65 we have @xmath66 .",
    "constants @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are the electron charge , electron mass , and the speed of light correspondingly .",
    "finally , @xmath70 is the magnitude of disordered magnetic field in an emitting region with a characteristic size @xmath71 along the line of sight .",
    "although we assume that the toroidal magnetic field dominates in the jet , an assumption of disordered magnetic field in our opinion can be retained , because , for an optically thin jet , the photon meets both directions of field .",
    "thus , the mean magnetic field along the photon path is almost zero , which mimics the behaviour of a disordered field . as a result",
    ", the parameters in the observer rest frame and plasma rest frame are connected by the following equations : @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the red - shift , @xmath77 is the doppler factor , @xmath78 is the jet half - opening angle , and @xmath79 is a viewing angle .",
    "further , the number density of emitting electrons @xmath80 is connected with the amplitude @xmath81 as @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "for @xmath65 we get @xmath84 we also put @xmath85 . here",
    "@xmath86 is a ratio of the number density of emitting particles to the mhd flow number density .",
    "the portion of particles effectively accelerated by the internal shocks was found by @xcite to be about 1% , so we take @xmath87 .",
    "finally , we assume  @xcite the following power law behavior for the magnetic field and particle density dependence on distance : @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the magnetic field and @xmath91 is the number density at @xmath92 pc respectively . for these scalings of particle density and magnetic field with the distance the turn - over frequency @xmath93 as a function of @xmath94 does not depend on @xmath95 and",
    "can be written as @xmath96 this scaling has been confirmed by @xcite in measurements of core - shifts for 20 agns made for 9 frequencies each . using these dependencies of magnetic field and particle number density of distance @xmath94 , we obtain in the observer rest frame @xmath97 where @xmath98 .    on the other hand , the values @xmath99 and @xmath91 can be related through introducing the flow magnetization parameter @xmath100  the ratio of poynting vector to particle kinetic energy flux at a given distance along the flow ( see appendix  [ a : mp ] ) .",
    "let us define the magnetization @xmath101 as a ratio of poynting vector to the total kinetic energy flux of emitting and non - emitting particles : @xmath102 here the kinetic energy flux of emitting electrons is @xmath103 and function @xmath104 for @xmath65 is defined by the following expression : @xmath105 estimating now the poynting vector as @xmath106 and particle kinetic energy fluxes as @xmath107 we obtain the following relationship between magnetic field and particle number density : @xmath108 in what follows , we neglect the term @xmath109 in comparison with @xmath5 .",
    "further on we omit the index @xmath86 . using ( [ equi ] ) ,",
    "we get @xmath110    as to the number density @xmath91 , it can be defined through the multiplicity parameter @xmath30 and total jet energy losses @xmath6 as ( see appendix  [ a : lambda ] for more detail ) @xmath111      to determine the intrinsic parameters of relativistic jets , let us consider two cases for the different magnetization at 1  pc . in what follows",
    "we assume that the flow at its base is highly , or at least mildly , magnetized , i.e. @xmath112 .",
    "first , we assume that up to the distance @xmath113  pc the plasma has been effectivily accelerated so that the poynting flux is smaller in comparison with the particle kinetic energy flux , i.e. , @xmath114 .",
    "in other words , the acceleration reached the saturation regime  @xcite .",
    "combining now ( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) , it is easy to obtain that this case corresponds to @xmath115 .",
    "accordingly , the bulk lorentz factor at @xmath113  pc can be evaluated as @xmath116 in this case eqn .",

    "the examples of importance of causal connectivity in a flow and its connection with the effective plasma acceleration has been pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .    in the case of the cylindrical jet model",
    "the question of casuality is even more severe . for a cylindrical model we take into account the force balance across a jet only ,",

    "the jet boundaries should be constrained by the `` mach cone '' following causal connection for the model to be self-consistent.thus , we come to the following criteria : we may assert that we can neglect the jet - long derivatives in a trans - field equation if any characteristic , outlet from a boundary at @xmath174 , not only reaches the axis , but does it at @xmath175 .     for different magnetic surface shapes for @xmath176 , i.e. further the equipartition .",

    "thus , the first two outflows are causally connected , and the last one may be causally disconnected .",
    "the cylindrical approach allows us to investigate the set of characteristics to check the causality of a flow .",
    "let us discuss the paraboloidal flow first .",
    "we can calculate the mach half - opening angle at each point , starting from the boundary , and so tracking the exact characteristics .",
    "this half - opening angle is defined with regard to the flow velocity direction .",
    "although in the cylindrical approach all the velocities have only the @xmath170-component , we may introduce the @xmath26-component by taking into account the given form of each magnetic surface .",
    "the latter is defined by the function @xmath193 and for inner parts of a flow @xmath194 .",
    "thus , we define the angle @xmath195 of a field - line tangent to a vertical direction as @xmath196 , and at the given point of a flow we outlet the fast characteristic with regard to thus defined flow direction .",

    "[ f : char - x2 ] ( center panel ) the net of characteristics for a paraboloidal flow depicted as described above .",
    "the characteristics are calculated starting from the jet boundary towards the axis .",
    "they are parameterized by the square of fast magnetosonic mach number @xmath197 at the axis at the same @xmath170 , where the characteristic starts .",
    "this is done uniformly regarding the mach number , thus the characteristics are plotted at different distances from each other .",
    "it can be seen that all the characteristics for parabolic jet boundary reach the axis at @xmath170 not much greater than @xmath173 .",
    "the same result holds for a flow @xmath191 either ( see fig .  [",

    "we show that the multiplicity parameter @xmath30 , which is the ratio of number density @xmath32 of outflowing plasma to goldreich - julian number density @xmath198 , can be obtained from the direct observations of core shift , apparent opening angle and radio power of a jet .",
    "the formula ( [ fin1 ] ) uses the following assumptions , taken from the theoretical model : ( i ) the acceleration process of plasma effectivily stops ( saturates ) when there is an equipartion regime , i.e. the poynting flux is equal to the plasma kinetic energy flux ; ( ii ) we assume the certain power - law scalings for magnetic field @xmath199 and number density @xmath200 as a functions of distance @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "these scalings are confirmed by @xcite .",
    "we also see that these power - laws are a good approximation from modelling the internal jet structure in section  [ s : struct ] .",
    "in contrast with @xcite and @xcite we do not assume the equipartition regime of radiating particles with magnetic field , but the relation between the particles ( radiating and non - radiating ) kinetic energy and poynting flux .",
    "we assume that only the small fraction of particles @xmath201 radiates @xcite and introduce the correlation between particle number density and magnetic field through the flow magnetization @xmath100 .",
    "although for @xmath202 both approaches give effectively the same relation between particle number density and magnetic field , for highly magnetized regime @xmath203 our approach yields the different result .",
    "probing both the equipartion regime @xmath202 and highly magnetized regime @xmath204 at parsec scales we conclude that the latter does not hold .    using the obtained michel magnetization parameter @xmath29",
    ", one can easily explain the observationally derived values @xcite , where @xmath5 is lorentz factor of bulk plasma motion and @xmath78 is a jet half - openong angle .",
    "indeed , as was found by @xcite , @xmath205 in the whole domain where @xmath206 , independent of the collimation geometry .",
    "this implies that @xmath207 up to the distance from the origin whence the transverse dimension of a jet @xmath208 . at larger distances @xmath5 remains practically constant , but for a parabolic geometry the opening angle decreases with the distance @xmath209 as @xmath210 . as a result ,",
    "one can write down @xmath211 this result is in agreement with the criteria of casual connectivity across a jet .",
    "indeed , for an outflow with an equipartition between the poynting and particle energy flux , we can write down @xmath212 for a boundary causally connected with an axis . in section  [ s : connect ] we have shown that for flows collimated better than a parabola , casuality connectivity across the jet holds further , i.e. for @xmath213 .",
    "the analysis of the frequency dependence of the observed shift of the core of relativistic agn jets allows us to determine physical parameters of the jets such as the plasma number density and the magnetic field inside the flow .",
    "we have estimated the multiplicity parameter @xmath30 to be of the order @xmath214@xmath215 .",
    "it is consistent with the blandford - znajek model  @xcite of the electron - positron generation in the magnetosphere of the black hole ( see * ? ? ? * as well ) .",
    "these values are in agreement with the particle number density @xmath0 which was found independently by  @xcite .",
    "as the transverse jet structure depends strongly on the flow regime , whether it is in equipartition or magnetically dominated , it is imporatant to know the relation between the observed and maximum lorentz factor .",
    "the michel magnetization parameter @xmath146 is equal to the maximum lorentz factor of plasma bulk motion .",
    "typical derived values of @xmath216 , in agreement with the lorentz factor estimated from vlbi jet kinematics  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and radio variability  @xcite .",
    "this implies that a flow is in the saturation regime . since for strongly collimated",
    "flow the condition of causial connection is fullfilled ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , the internal structure of an outflow can be modelled within the cylindrical approach @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the results of the modelling , such as lorentz factor dependence on the jet distance , are in a good agreement with the observations .",
    "in particular , the relative growth of lorentz factor @xmath217 with the distance along the axis is slow for the jets in saturation regime , having the magnitude @xmath218 per year .",
    "this result may account for the recent masurements of acceleration in agn jets  @xcite .",
    "we plan to address the following points in a separate paper : ( i ) the role of the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field and particle number density in a core , ( ii ) the action of the radiation drag force  @xcite , ( iii ) the possible influence of mass loading  @xcite on the jet magnetization and dynamics .",
