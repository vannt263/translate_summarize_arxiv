    ", we have had real breakthroughs in our understanding of high - energy scattering near the unitarity limit .",
    "namely , we have understood how to deal with small-@xmath0 dynamics at high energy _ beyond the mean field approximation _ ,",
    "i.e. , beyond the bk - equation . in this work , after briefly introducing the known dynamics in the mean - field case , we discuss the main steps of the recent theoretical progress as follows : we start with a discussion of the first step beyond the mean field approximation , which was done in ref .  @xcite by enforcing the bfkl evolution in the scattering process to satisfy natural requirements as unitarity limits and lorentz invariance .",
    "the consequence was a correction to the saturation scale and the breaking of the geometric scaling at high energies .",
    "then , we explain the relation between high - energy qcd and statistical physics found in ref .",
    "@xcite which has clarified the physical picture of , and the way to deal with , the dynamics beyond the bk - equation .",
    "we explain that _ gluon number fluctuations _ from one scattering event to another and the _ discreteness _ of gluon numbers , both ignored in the bk evolution and also in the balitsky - jimwlk equations  @xcite , lead to the breaking of the geometric scaling and to the correction to the saturation scale , respectively . in a next step",
    "we show the new evolution equations , the so - called pomeron loop equations  @xcite , which include a new element in the evolution , the pomeron loop .",
    "finally , we discuss the possibility of phenomenological implications  @xcite of the recent theoretical advances .",

    "consider the high - energy scattering of a dipole of transverse size @xmath1 off a target ( hadron , nucleus ) at rapidity @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3-dependence of the @xmath4-matrix in the mean field approximation is given by the bk - equation ( @xmath3-dependence is suppressed for simplicity ) @xmath5 \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : bk_eq}\\ ] ] this equation can be interpreted as follows ; if increasing the rapidity of the dipole by @xmath6 while keeping the rapidity of the target fixed , the probability for the dipole to emit a gluon increases . in the large-@xmath7",
    "limit the initial quark - antiquark state plus the emitted gluon can be viewed as two dipoles - one of the dipoles consists of the inital quark and the aniquark part of the gluon whike the other dipoles is given by the quark part of the gluon and the inital antiquark .",
    "the probability for the spliting of the inital dipole @xmath8 into two doughter dipoles with transverse sizes @xmath9 and @xmath10 is given by the weight in eq.([eq : bk_eq ] ) , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the transverse size of the emitted gluon and @xmath13 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "on the right - hand side of eq.([eq : bk_eq ] ) , the first three terms ( first one is virtual ) describe the scattering of a single dipole with the target whereas the last term gives the simultanous scattering of the two doughter dipoles with the target , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bk_eq ] . without the last term",
    ", the bk - equation reduces to a linear equation , the bfkl equation , which gives the growth of @xmath14 with rapidity , while the nonlinaer term , @xmath15 , tames the growth of @xmath16 such that the unitarity limit , @xmath17 , is satisfied .",
    "one of the main results following from the bk - equation is the _ geometric scaling _",
    "behaviour of the @xmath4-matrix  @xcite in a large kinematical window @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the so - called _ saturation momentum _",
    "defined such that @xmath20 be of @xmath21 .",
    "( [ eq : gs ] ) means that the @xmath4-matrix scales with a single quantity @xmath22 rather than depending on @xmath23 and @xmath3 separatelly .",
    "this behaviour implies a similar scaling for the dis cross section , @xmath24 , which is supported by the hera data  @xcite .",
    "another important result that can be extracted from the bk - equation is the rapidity dependence of the saturation momentum ( leading-@xmath3 contribution)@xcite , @xmath25 \\ ,    \\label{eq : qrmf}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the bfkl kernel and @xmath27 .",
    "the shape of the @xmath4-matrix resulting from the bk - equation is preserved in the transition region from weak ( @xmath28 ) to strong ( @xmath29 ) scattering with increasing @xmath3 , showing a `` travelling wave '' behaviour as sketched in fig.[fig : bk_eq1 ] , on the left hand side . with increasing @xmath3 , the saturation region at @xmath30 where @xmath29 however widens up , including smaller and smaller dipoles , due to the growth of the saturation momentum .",
    "as we will see in the next sections , the situation changes a lot once gluon number fluctuations are taken into account .",
    "let s start with an elementary dipole of size @xmath31 at rapidity @xmath32 and evolve it using the bfkl evolution up to @xmath33 .",
    "the number density of dipoles of size @xmath34 at @xmath3 in this dipole , @xmath35 , obeys a completeness relation @xmath36 where on the right hand side the rapidity evolution is separated in two successive steps , @xmath37 . with @xmath38 eq.([eq : nlf ] ) can be approximately rewritten in terms of the @xmath4-matrix as @xmath39 where @xmath40 . in ref .  @xcite it was realized that the above completeness relations , or , equivalently , the lorentz invariance , is satisfied by the bk evolution only by violating unitarity limits .",
    "this can be illustrated as follows : suppose that @xmath34 is close to the saturation line , @xmath41 , so that the left hand side of eq.([eq : tlf ] ) is large . on the right hand side of eq.([eq : tlf ] ) it turns out that @xmath42 is typically very small in the region of @xmath43 which dominates the integral .",
    "this means that @xmath44 must be typically very large and must violate unitarity , @xmath45 , in order to satisfy ( [ eq : tlf ] ) .    the simple procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite to solve the above problem was to limit the region of the @xmath43-integration in eq.([eq : tlf ] ) by a boundary @xmath46 so that @xmath44 would never violate unitarity , or @xmath42 would always be larger than @xmath47 .",
    "the main consequence of this procedure , i.e. , bk evolution plus boundary correcting it in the weak scattering region , is the following scaling behaviour of the @xmath4-matrix near the unitarity limit @xmath48 and the following energy dependence of the saturation momentum @xmath49 \\label{eq : qrbmf}\\ ] ] with @xmath50 eq.([eq : trbmf ] ) shows the breaking of the geometric scaling , which was the hallmark of the bk - equation shown in eq.([eq : gs ] ) , and eq.([eq : qrbmf ] ) shows the correction to the saturation momentum ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq : qrmf ] ) ) , both emerging as a consequence of the evolution beyond the mean field approximation .",
    "the high energy evolution can be viewed also in another way which is inspired by dynamics of reaction - diffusion processes in statistical physics  @xcite . to show it ,",
    "let s consider an elementary target dipole of size @xmath31 which evolves from @xmath51 up to @xmath33 and is then probed by an elementary dipole of size @xmath23 , giving the amplitude @xmath52 .",
    "it has become clear that the evolution of the target dipole is _ stochastic _ leading to random dipole number realizations inside the target dipole at @xmath3 , corresponding to different events in an experiment . the physical amplitude , @xmath52 ,",
    "is then given by averaging over all possible dipole number realizations / events , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the amplitude for dipole @xmath23 scattering off a particular realization of the evolved target dipole at @xmath3 .",
    "an illustration is shown in fig.[fig : bk_eq1 ] , the right - hand side plot , where the @xmath4-matrix for different events ( thin lines ) and the average over all events ( thick lines ) , @xmath55 , are shown at two different rapidities , respectivelly .",
    "the mean field description breaks down at low target dipole occupancy due to the _ discreteness and the fluctuations of dipole numbers_. because of discreteness the dipole occupancy can not be less than one for any dipole size . taking this fact into account by using the bk equation with a cutoff when @xmath4 becomes of order @xmath56  @xcite , or the occupancy of order one ( see eq.([eq : tn ] ) ) , leads exactly to the same correction for the saturation momentum as given in eq.([eq : qrmf ] ) .",
    "the latter cutoff is essentially the same as , and gives a natural explanation of , the boundary used in ref.@xcite and briefly explained in the previous section .",
    "the dipole number fluctuations in the low dipole occupancy region result in fluctuations of the saturation momentum from event to event , with the strength @xmath57 extracted from numerical simulations of statistical models .",
    "the averaging over all events with random saturation momenta , in order to get the physical amplitude , causes the breaking of the geometric scaling and replaces it by a new scaling law , the so - called _ diffusive scaling _ , in which case the scattering amplitude is a function of another variable , @xmath58 this equation differs from eq.([eq : trbmf ] ) since eq.([eq : trbmf ] ) misses dipole number fluctuations .",
    "note that because of the geometric scaling violation , the result in eq.([eq : tqs ] ) changes the shape as the rapidity increases , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bk_eq1 ] ( right - hand side ) by the decreasing slope of the thick line with growing rapidity , in contrast to the solution to the bk - equation in eq.([eq : gs ] ) .",
    "the statistical physics / high - density qcd correspondence suggests the following picture for the wavefunction of a highly evolved hadron which is probed by a dipole of transverse size @xmath23 : as the hadron is boosted to high rapidities the density of gluons inside the hadron grows .",
    "also the fluctuation in gluon numbers , which is characterized by the dispersion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp ] ) , grows with rising rapidity .",
    "however , as long as @xmath59 , which means @xmath60 , the effects of fluctuations can be neglected and the evolution of the hadron is described to a good approximation by the bk - equation . thus , for @xmath61 , as shown in fig.[fig : picture ] , to the left of the saturation line , @xmath62 , is the `` saturation region '' with the `` large - size '' ( small momentum ) gluons at a large density , of order @xmath63 or the @xmath64 , while the shadowed region is the transition region from high to low gluon density , or the front of the at @xmath4-matrix ( geometric scaling regime ) . at higher rapidities , @xmath65 , where the fluctuations become important , the geometric scaling regime is replaced by the diffusive scaling given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tqs ] ) .",
    "it was always clear that the bk equation does not include fluctuations .",
    "however , it took some time to realize that also the balitsky - jimwlk equations do miss them .",
    "it turned out  ( see first reference in @xcite ) that the balitsky - jimwlk equations do include bfkl evolution , `` pomeron mergings '' but not also `` pomeron splittings '' , which are represented by the three graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig : bjimwlk ] for two dipoles scattering off a target , respectivelly . after this insight , the so - called pomeron loop equations  @xcite",
    "have been constructed to account for `` pomeron splittings '' or dipole number fluctuations .",
