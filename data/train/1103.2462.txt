    "recall from the work of harer , mumford , penner and thurston ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) that ribbon graphs label cells in a decomposition of the moduli space of punctured riemann surfaces .",
    "the graph itself is a retraction of the surface , also known as a _ skeleton _ or _ spine .",
    "_ let @xmath5 denote a punctured riemann surface with spine @xmath2 we imagine a stein structure on @xmath5 so that @xmath0 is the skeleton ( the union of all stable manifolds ) of the stein function .",
    "kontsevich in @xcite conjectured that the fukaya category of a stein manifold can be computed locally on the skeleton and discussed applications to homological mirror symmetry for riemann surfaces . in this paper",
    ", we investigate this idea from the perspective of constructible sheaves and t - duality .",
    "we shall define , starting from a ribbon graph @xmath0 , a category @xmath1 ( `` constructible plumbing model '' ) , defined using the language of constructible sheaves .",
    "@xmath1 serves as a stand - in for the fukaya category @xmath6 of the surface @xmath5 .",
    "when the ribbon graph is appropriately decorated and carries a combinatorial version of a torus fibration with section , then we can define a `` mirror '' curve @xmath3 , an algebraic stack with toric components . exploiting a beilinson - bondal - type equivalence called the coherent - constructible correspondence @xcite ,",
    "we prove @xmath7 an equivalence of dg categories .",
    "we conjecture that @xmath8 together with the above result , this would prove a one - dimensional version of homological mirror symmetry .",
    "recall from @xcite that the fukaya category of a cotangent bundle @xmath9 is equivalent to constructible sheaves on the base , @xmath10 one can specialize to sheaves that are constructible for a particular stratification @xmath11 by only considering a subcategory of the fukaya category generated by lagrangians which are asymptotic to a conical lagrangian submanifold @xmath12 depending on @xmath13 the conical lagrangian @xmath14 encodes the `` microlocal behavior '' of the corresponding sheaf . when the conical lagrangian submanifold @xmath15 is strictly @xmath16-invariant and not necessarily @xmath17-invariant in the fibers , the corresponding subcategory of sheaves has `` singular support '' in @xmath14 a somewhat more refined microlocal condition than that defined by a stratification .",
    "for example , when @xmath18 @xmath15 will be a subset of the zero section together with a finite number of rays of cotangent fibers ",
    "i.e. , a graph with valency @xmath19 at each vertex .",
    "for instance , the category of sheaves on @xmath20 stratified by a point and its complement corresponds to @xmath15 which is the union of the zero section and the cotangent fiber of the point  a graph with one 4-valent vertex and one loop .",
    "the graph is a ribbon graph , since the symplectic geometry of the cotangent of @xmath20 determines a cyclic ordering of the edges .",
    "it was proven in @xcite that constructible sheaves on @xmath20 with this stratification are equivalent to coherent sheaves on @xmath21 since this category of constructible sheaves is equivalent to a fukaya category on @xmath22 , by @xcite , this equivalence is a form of or mirror symmetry .    the model @xmath23 is constructed by gluing pieces of a graph together , and can be inferred from the following example . consider a family of conics @xmath24 in @xmath25 defined in homogeneous coordinates by @xmath26 , or in inhomogeneous coordinates by @xmath27 these conics are all isomorphic to @xmath28 when @xmath29 but degenerate to two copies of @xmath28 attached at a node when @xmath30 the conics all have an open orbit @xmath31 of a _ common _ @xmath32 defined by @xmath33 i.e @xmath31 has an @xmath20 fibration over @xmath34 .",
    "we can pick a @xmath35-equivariant line bundle on @xmath25 such as the hyperplane bundle , give it a metric ( and thus compatible connection ) invariant under @xmath36 , restrict it to @xmath31 and compute the monodromies over the @xmath17 family of @xmath20 orbits .",
    "the resulting spectral curve , the `` t - dual lagrangian '' @xmath37 lies in @xmath38 ( the dual @xmath20 , actually ) , for @xmath39 we study the degeneration @xmath40    when @xmath41 , @xmath42 `` splits '' into two lagrangians on two different cotangents of two copies of a circle stratified by a point @xmath43 and its complement  but they are joined : @xmath44 inside @xmath45 from the perspective of one circle is glued to @xmath46 of the other circle ( just as the corresponding limits of @xmath47 orbits on the two @xmath28 components are joined ) . in terms of coordinates",
    "@xmath48 on @xmath49 the @xmath42 look like @xmath50 this splitting is illustrated for two values of @xmath51 .",
    "the picture suggests that coherent sheaves ( perfect complexes , actually @xcite ) on the degenerate conic can be described by pairs of constructible sheaves on @xmath20 such that the microlocal stalk of one sheaf along the ray to @xmath44 in @xmath45 equals the microlocal stalk of the other sheaf along the ray to @xmath46 .",
    "the graph @xmath15 for such a gluing has two 4-valent vertices attached by a single edge , and two loops  a bit like a curtain rod with two rings . extending this example",
    ", we can consider a further gluing of the toric endpoints of the two @xmath28 components .",
    "it becomes clear what to do to build a constructible model for this algebraic curve : glue the curtain rod along its two ends .",
    "the graph is a circle with two circles attached at two distinct points  a combinatorial version of a torus fibration !",
    "the algebraic curve obtained in this way is a degenerate elliptic curve  a calabi - yau manifold with toric components , such as what appears at the large complex structure limit point in mirror symmetry .",
    "the ribbon graph category is a model for the fukaya category of the exact symplectic manifold at the large radius limit ( the symplectic manifold gets compactified in deformations @xcite which are mirror to smoothing the elliptic curve ) corresponding to the ribbon graph , and is equivalent to coherent sheaves on the algebraic mirror calabi - yau . through this reasoning ,",
    "then , we get a model for homological mirror symmetry of degenerate calabi - yau manifolds .    to summarize :    * each four - valent vertex is modeled by the category @xmath52 of constructible sheaves on @xmath17 stratified by a point and its complement .",
    "* two opposing half - edges of a four - valent vertex represent the two @xmath17 directions , while the remaining two represent the _",
    "microlocal stalks _ of the constructible sheaves .",
    "more succinctly , @xmath52 has four functors to chain complexes ( constructible sheaves on edge intervals ) defined by the stalks or microlocal stalks at the rays corresponding to the four half - edges .",
    "* categories are glued as `` fiber products , '' i.e. by taking objects at each vertex category and requiring that the images of objects at two vertices agree along an edge which joins them .",
    "* when the graph has a map to a cycle graph , with circle fibers over the vertices , we can join together the toric curves corresponding to the fibers to make a degenerate calabi - yau .",
    "coherent sheaves on this calabi - yau will be isomorphic to the constructible plumbing model of the ribbon graph .",
    "the discussion thus far has been quite informal .",
    "the paper is dedicated to making these observations rigorous . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the notions needed to take fiber products and more general limits of dg categories , and review material on algebraic stacks and ribbon graphs . in section 3 , we define _ chordal _ ribbon graphs , which encode the structure of being `` locally like @xmath53 '' used to relate to constructible sheaves .",
    "we review the microlocal theory of sheaves in one dimension and define @xmath1 from a chordal ribbon graph @xmath0 by gluing , as discussed above . in section 4 , we define the notion of `` dualizable '' ribbon graph , @xmath0  the structure called a `` combinatorial version of a torus fibration '' above  which allows us to construct an algebraic curve @xmath3 with toric components such that @xmath54    our discussion of fukaya categories and skeleta suggests that the proper definition of @xmath23 should not depend on its chordal structure .",
    "instead , one should work with the more general notion of a _ graded ribbon graph_. in section 5",
    ", we introduce the category of graded ribbon graphs , then define a _ fukaya formalism _ to be a functor from this category to dg categories , such that contractions are represented by isomorphisms .",
    "proving that @xmath23 extends to a fukaya formalism is the subject of work in progress .",
    "our construction is influenced by the work of many others , and we are grateful for their inspiring works .",
    "we highlight a few .    *",

    "since the plumbing perspective we take in this paper requires us to build new dg categories out of old , we have to have a good handle on `` what dg categories form . ''",
    "the answer is contained in the work of many people , including drinfeld , tabuada , ton , and lurie .",
