    "the experimental realization of a dilute bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , a quantum - degenerate atomic bose gas , has led to a wide range of experiments in atom optics ( see , for example , ref .",
    "the macroscopically occupied ground state exhibits large - scale coherence , which can be exploited in atom optical techniques .",
    "one such technique is bragg scattering , which has been applied to make precise measurements of condensate momentum @xcite , investigate excitations @xcite , measure the phase coherence length @xcite , excite phonons @xcite , and to implement four - wave mixing @xcite and a mach - zehnder interferometer @xcite .",
    "more recently , blakie _ et al . _ showed that the velocity sensitivity of bragg scattering can provide a means of detecting superfluid flow associated with condensates in a vortex state @xcite .",
    "in all this work , the initial bose condensates have been well described as wave - functions with a stationary center of mass ( com ) , making them an ideal source for atom - optic experiments using bragg scattering .",
    "in conventional bragg spectroscopy the spectrum is given by the spectral response function of the condensate @xcite , which is related to the momentum distribution and under certain conditions is a good measure of this distribution . in this work ,",
    "we show that for an accelerating condensate , the spectrum is no longer a direct representation of the momentum distribution .",
    "we investigate bragg spectroscopy for the case of a bose condensate undergoing circular micro - motion in a time - averaged orbiting potential ( top ) trap @xcite .",
    "although the condensate micro - motion is small in amplitude , we demonstrate that the com acceleration can be large enough to dramatically alter the bragg spectrum .",
    "our experimental results are compared to a theoretical spectrum for the corresponding stationary condensate , illustrating that the effect of the acceleration is to significantly broaden the bragg spectrum and introduce complex structure .",
    "we describe two simple models to explain the underlying physics of the observed behavior , and present numerical simulations using the one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) which confirm our interpretation .",
    "in this section we summarize aspects of micro - motion in a top trap that are relevant to its affect on bragg spectroscopy , and present two simple models for describing the modified bragg scattering process .",
    "the instantaneous magnetic field for our top trap is , as given in ref .",
    "@xcite ,    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the quadrupole field gradient along the radial direction , @xmath2 is the magnitude of the rotating bias field , and @xmath3 is the angular frequency of the the bias field rotation .",
    "@xcite showed that , for time scales longer than the rotation period , the atoms experience only the leading terms in the magnitude of the time averaged magnetic field so that    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the radial coordinate . for many experiments , this time - average is an appropriate description , but for bragg spectroscopy this is not always the case @xcite .",
    "the time - varying force on the condensate results in com oscillation or micro - motion ( as pointed out by petrich _",
    "@xcite ) , to which bragg spectroscopy is sensitive .",
    "the origin of this micro - motion can be seen by considering the instantaneous potential of the top trap    @xmath6^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the so - called radius ( the radius where the point rotates in the plane ) and the time - varying force is given by . typically , in the region of the condensate in the trap , and we can approximate the magnitude of the force along the _",
    "x_-axis ( for example ) as    @xmath8    ignoring condensate mean - field effects ( since the trapping force is large ) we find that the classical solution for the magnitude of the time - varying com momentum and position are given by    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the atomic mass and we have assumed for simplicity , and .",
    "the condensate com along the _",
    "x_-axis performs simple harmonic motion , and from trap symmetry we deduce that the condensate performs circular motion in the plane of the rotating bias field .",
    "this result was first obtained and experimentally confirmed by mller _",
    "_ @xcite .    to discuss the implications of centripetal acceleration for bragg spectroscopy",
    "we first briefly summarize bragg scattering @xcite .",
    "a moving optical grating is applied to the condensate and atoms can absorb @xmath11 photons from one beam ( @xmath12 ) and emit @xmath13 photons , via stimulated emission , into the other ( @xmath14 ) where , and the detuning is .",
    "this results in the transfer of momentum and energy @xmath15 , where , and @xmath16 is the angle between the two beams forming the grating",
    ". this process will be resonant for non - interacting stationary atoms if the final kinetic energy of the atom is equal to the energy difference between the bragg beams i.e.  .    when calculating the resonance condition for atoms which are initially moving in the lab frame an additional term arises , which can be attributed to the doppler effect , and which we will call the doppler term @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the condensate momentum ) . in the micro - motion case we have giving a doppler term which results in a new time - dependent bragg detuning condition . for first order bragg scattering ( @xmath19 )",
    "this condition is    @xmath20    note that when @xmath21 is greater than @xmath22 the resonance condition can only be satisfied for , so that bragg scattering is resonant only for some instant during half of the top cycle .",
    "similarly , if @xmath23 resonance only occurs if .",
    "therefore , if the bragg pulse length , @xmath24 , is not an integer multiple of the top period the bragg spectrum will be asymmetric .",
    "we avoid this problem by having @xmath24 equal to eight top rotations .",
    "alternatively , we can picture the bragg scattering process in the rest frame of the condensate and think of the micro - motion as modifying the optical potential . in the absence of micro - motion",
    "the effective optical potential from two counter - propagating , pulsed , laser beams is given by @xcite    @xmath25    where the amplitude @xmath26 is twice the ac stark shift at the grating maximum . in this case",
    ", the potential has a spectrum centered at the frequency difference between the two bragg beams , with an _ rms _ half - width .",
    "the effect of the micro - motion can be incorporated into the optical potential by transforming to the stationary frame of the condensate .",
    "the resulting time - dependent frequency shift of the bragg resonance condition in the laboratory frame produces a frequency modulated ( fm ) optical potential in the condensates rest frame , as pointed out by cristiani _",
    "the modified potential becomes    @xmath27    where the bar denotes the com frame of the condensate and .",
    "this frequency modulation generates side - bands in the frequency spectrum of the optical potential , yielding multiple first - order bragg resonances .",
    "bragg spectroscopy involves scanning the frequency difference @xmath21 through resonance and measuring the out - coupled fraction .",
    "to resolve features in the condensate s bragg spectrum requires the frequency width of the bragg light to be narrower than the spectral width of the feature .",
    "mechanisms that contribute to the condensate momentum width @xcite are doppler broadening , where @xmath28 is the condensate radius , and mean - field ( collisional ) broadening , where @xmath29 is the chemical potential at the peak density .",
    "in addition to these effects and the spectral broadening associated with finite pulse time , there is also a power broadening contribution @xcite .",
    "our apparatus for producing bose condensates is described in martin , but with some minor modifications .",
    "briefly , we use a double magneto - optical trap ( mot ) to cool and trap @xmath30rb atoms , which is driven by injection - seeded diode lasers and with continuous loading of the low - pressure mot .",
    "the laser cooled sample is transferred to a magnetic top trap and evaporatively cooled to produce a condensate containing approximately in the hyperfine ground state .    following condensate formation ,",
    "the magnetic trap was adiabatically relaxed ( by reducing the quadrupole field gradient and increasing the bias field over 200  ms ) to trapping frequencies of . for our bias field rotation frequency ,",
    "the corresponding tangential micro - motion velocity is 3.3  mm  s@xmath31 ( compared to the two - photon recoil velocity of 11.8  mm  s@xmath31 ) .",
    "although the amplitude of the motion is only 190  nm , the high relative velocity means that the effect of the micro - motion on the bragg spectrum is substantial .",
    "counter - propagating bragg beams were generated using a coherent mbr ti : sapphire laser , the output of which was split and passed through two acousto - optic modulators ( aoms ) to provide individual frequency control .",
    "we used a detuning above the to transition , giving a spontaneous scattering rate of approximately @xmath32  s@xmath31 ( i.e.  negligible for our purposes ) .",
    "both beams were aligned in the plane of the rotating bias field .",
    "a pulse length of was chosen for a spectral width @xmath33 comparable to the width of an equivalent stationary condensate with our parameters .",
    "the pulse length is also shorter than a quarter trap period so that the bragg scattered fraction becomes well separated from the unscattered component in time - of - flight .",
    "the intensity was set between 0.26(5 ) to 0.6(1 )  mw  @xmath34 . to minimize the effect of timing differences between consecutive measurements we synchronized the bragg pulse with the rotation of the bias field . at the end of the pulse ,",
    "the condensate was released from the trap and imaged by resonant absorption after @xmath35  ms of free expansion .",
    "bragg spectroscopy was performed by measuring the first - order scattered fraction as a function of the frequency difference between the two bragg beams .",
    "for a stationary bose condensate confined in a static harmonic potential with our experimental parameters , the bragg spectrum has a simple form ( essentially gaussian ) with a narrow width .",
    "however , the presence of micro - motion introduces substantial broadening and complex structure . in fig .",
    "[ subplot+tof ] we show the bragg scattered data obtained for a condensate undergoing centripetal acceleration in the plane of the bragg beams . also shown is a theoretical spectrum for our condensate parameters , ignoring mean - field effects ( which are small in this case ) and assuming no micro - motion .",
    "the _ rms _ half - width of the theoretical curve is 0.56  khz , which is consistent with our measurements made in time - of - flight where micro - motion is absent .    to explain the complex structure in the experimental spectrum , we now present results of the simple fm picture described in the previous section .    ) and an intensity of 0.26(5 )  mw  @xmath34 ( corresponding to a power broadening contribution of 0.22(4 )  khz ) . ]",
    "we obtain the frequency components present in the bragg light by performing a fourier transform on the modified optical potential given by eq .",
    "( [ fmgrating ] ) .",
    "the result is a spectrum for the bragg light which has a carrier at the frequency difference between the bragg beams ( @xmath21 ) , and side - bands ( spaced by @xmath36 ) with relative amplitudes determined by bessel functions of the fm spectrum @xcite . in this case",
    "the modulation index , upon which the bessel functions are strictly dependent , is just the maximum doppler shift divided by the modulation frequency and can therefore be adjusted by simply changing the quadrupole field gradient . in fig .",
    "[ datamodel ] the experimental data from fig .",
    "[ subplot+tof ] is overlaid with the corresponding frequency spectrum of the modified optical potential @xmath37 ( scaled by an arbitrary factor ) .",
    "since there are a number of side - bands with significant amplitude , when we sweep the carrier frequency ( @xmath21 ) to generate the bragg spectrum we bring successive side - bands into resonance with the condensate .",
    "the exact form of the bragg spectrum is then a combination of the complex spectral character of the light and the spectral response of the stationary condensate . when the bragg spectrum of the stationary condensate is narrow compared to the bias field rotation frequency ( as in our case ) , the bragg spectrum with micro - motion has peaks at frequencies corresponding to the locations of the side - bands . to within the spectral uncertainty of our bragg experiments , approximately @xmath38  khz ,",
    "this behavior is shown in the data of fig .",
    "[ datamodel ] .",
    "although we can not resolve the predicted individual spectral peaks , the overall range of frequencies for which we get bragg scattering matches the range over which there is significant sideband intensity .",
    "our spectral resolution is limited by a number of physical processes , including the mechanical stability of the optics and the electrical stability of the currents driving the magnetic trap . from a heterodyne measurement using the two bragg beams we determined that the uncertainty due to the mechanical stability of the optics ( which doppler shifts the light ) is approximately @xmath39  khz , whereas the contribution to the uncertainty from current stability is approximately @xmath40  khz .",
    "the main effect of current instability is to put noise on the quadrupole gradient , which in turn puts noise on the time - varying com momentum , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ oscilmomentum ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties in our measurements of the fraction of scattered atoms were determined by making repetitive measurements with the same parameters , and can vary across the spectrum .",
    "the significant contributions arise from shot - to - shot condensate variation and the minimum scattered fraction we can measure with our imaging system .    the bragg scattered data from fig .",

    "the relative heights of the peaks in the fm spectrum are determined by the modulation index and the width of each peak is determined by the finite pulse length @xmath41 .",
    "each data point has an uncertainty in the scattered fraction of @xmath42 .",
    "the dashed line indicates the minimum detectable fraction for this data and below this limit we plot the data as having zero scattered fraction . ]    at low intensity the simple fm picture predicts some important features such as the frequencies and relative heights of the peaks , but the widths of each peak only include a contribution from the finite pulse time . to obtain a more accurate prediction of the experimental results we include the dynamic term of the top trap in a collisionless one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation simulation , using a one - dimensional version of eq .",

    "each data point has an uncertainty in the scattered fraction of between @xmath43 to @xmath44 depending on @xmath45 . ]    as an additional test of our interpretation we now consider a power broadened case ( i.e.  a higher value for @xmath46 ) .",
    "this alleviates the need to resolve very narrow spectral features and gives larger ( more easily measured ) bragg scattered fractions near the central region of the spectrum .",
    "[ gpe+data ] shows a power broadened bragg spectrum together with the corresponding numerical simulation .",
    "the contribution to the condensate width from power broadening is @xmath47  khz , compared to @xmath48  khz from doppler broadening ( the dominant condensate contribution ) . within the limits of our experimental uncertainty , the agreement between the data and the simulation is reasonable .",
    "the overall width of the spectrum is well predicted , and the variation in the bragg scattered fraction is reduced , as expected .",
    "the small difference between the center frequencies of the gpe simulations and experimental data spectra is likely to be due to our linear one - dimensional modeling of a nonlinear three - dimensional experiment @xcite .",
    "the slight asymmetry in the numerical spectrum ( which we can not resolve in the experimental data ) becomes apparent when transforming to the condensate rest frame through a damped drift term @xcite .",
    "additional asymmetry can occur if the bragg pulse length does not match an integer multiple of the top trap rotation period , but this is not the case for the results presented here .",
    "a process not included in our linear gpe simulations , but which can significantly alter the bragg spectrum @xcite , is the mean field collisional interaction in the condensate .",
