    "while the behavior in the charge sector in the  @xmath0-hubbard model is rather non - generic , the spin sector reflects the expected physics of correlated fermi systems : for example , the magnetic susceptibility strongly increases with interaction and develops a strong low - temperature peak at the spin - exchange energy scale  @xmath483 . after the mcit the static spin - spin correlation function displays strong antiferromagnetic correlations with a logarithmic divergence in momentum space at  @xmath389 .",
    "the  @xmath0-tj model with pair - hopping terms displays a metal - to - spin - insulator transition at  @xmath484 .",
    "the spin liquid state is described by the gutzwiller projected fermi - sea and provides an exactly solvable example of a genuine rvb - state . at the msit , simultaneously with the opening of a spin gap , the zero - frequency `` spin - conductivity '' ( drude weight for spin transport ) drops to zero , after having increased with @xmath485 ( to a finite value ) on the spin liquid side .",
    "the msit appears as a pure level - crossing effect , and thus should not be interpreted as a mott - type transition  @xcite .",

    "<S> while the magnetic properties of these models reflect the genuine features of strongly correlated electron systems , the charge transport properties , especially near the mott - hubbard transition , display a non - generic behavior . </S>"
