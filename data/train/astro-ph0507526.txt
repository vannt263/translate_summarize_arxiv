    "since their discovery in the mid-1980 s , collimated jets from young stars have played an increasingly important role in clarifying how stars form .",
    "jets provide a means for protoplanetary disks to shed angular momentum as disk material accretes onto the star , and recent observations of rotation in jets provide a direct observational link to the accretion disk that ultimately powers these flows @xcite .",
    "most stars are members of binaries , and jets provide crucial information about disks in such systems through measurements of precession @xcite , and by tracing separate flows from both components of close binaries @xcite .",
    "jets evacuate large cavities that pierce the surrounding molecular cloud and power large - scale bipolar molecular outflows which help to support molecular clouds against gravitational collapse @xcite . because outflows are driven by accretion ,",
    "knots in jets give a fossil record of the accretion history of young stars .",
    "collimated outflows also accompany accretion disks in compact galactic sources @xcite , and in extragalactic nuclei @xcite ; jets from young stars are a particularly good place to study the connection between accretion and outflow because shock waves in the flow cool radiatively , so images and spectra reveal where the flows are heated and trace how they propagate .",
    "the excellent spatial resolution provided by the hubble space telescope has greatly advanced our understanding of jet dynamics .",
    "cooling zones behind shock waves in stellar jets are typically near the limit of what can be resolved from the ground , but these zones are clearly resolvable with _ hst_. shock waves in nearby jets move @xmath4 1 arcsecond per decade , but also change their spatial structure on that timescale .",
    "hence , the subarcsecond spatial resolution provided by _",
    "hst _ makes it possible to detect real differential motions between jet knots , and thereby observe the complex dynamics of working surfaces , merging bow shocks , and fluid instabilities in real time .",
    "it is possible to observe the true density structure and calculate mass loss rates directly when jets are irradiated by ultraviolet light @xcite .",
    "the three bright stellar jets ( hh  1 , hh  34 , and hh  111 ) we have observed to date in this manner each reveal something new and unexpected about the dynamics of jets from young stars .",
    "a portion of the large bow shock hh  34 @xcite appears to be in the process of forming a rayleigh - taylor instability , and we observed new shock waves form as dense knots emerged from the source .",
    "the proper motions in hh  111 @xcite clearly show the aftermath of merging bow shocks , and faint emission wings along the shocks in the flow demonstrate that the surrounding material plays no role in collimating the jet once the jet emerges from the source . because hh  111 is in the plane of the sky , the proper motions are the true space velocities ,",
    "so here we can observe the actual velocity variations in the flow and thereby test models of radiative shocks in jets .",
    "a remarkable area of strong shear exists along the edges of the bow shock hh  1 , while the flow is much more complex and less ordered on the opposite side of the flow in hh  2 @xcite .",
    "discovered by @xcite , the famous hh  46/47 bipolar outflow is in many ways an ideal object to study jet dynamics .",
    "the jet is bright , and shows a classic structure of a collimated flow with several large bow shocks .",
    "the brightest bow shock , hh  47a , is one of the best examples of a working surface , and h@xmath0 images of the system taken with _ hst _",
    "* hereafter h96 )",
    "reveal a distinct bow shock that accelerates downstream material and a mach disk that decelerates incident jet gas .",
    "the star formation in the region is relatively simple  the jet emanates from a resolved ( @xmath5 ) low mass binary system surrounded by a circumstellar disk @xcite that has formed in the isolated bok globule eso 210 - 6a at the edge of the gum nebula .",
    "this binary is the only known young stellar system in the globule .",
    "the globule is clearly compressed to the north and west toward the source of ionizing radiation ( figure  1 of h96 ) .",
    "the nascent stellar system and circumstellar disk are thus transitioning from being embedded in the dense globule to being exposed to the uv radiation from the nearby massive stars @xmath6 pup and @xmath7 vel through photoevaporation of the surrounding envelope @xcite .",
    "the hh  46/47 outflow has been studied extensively across the electromagnetic spectrum at uv , optical , and infrared wavelengths ( h96 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the optically bright hh  46/47 jet is part of the northeast flow , and terminates in the hh  47a bow shock @xmath8 from the ir driving source . hh  47a moves outward in the wake of the larger , fainter bow shock hh  47d . a faint counterjet in the redshifted southwest lobe @xcite extends toward the bow shock hh  47c @xcite .",
    "assuming a distance of 450 pc @xcite , the visible outflow from hh  47d to hh  47c extends @xmath40.57 pc .",
    "the outflow velocities of @xmath4300 km@xmath2s@xmath3 derived from proper - motion and radial - velocity studies @xcite imply a kinematical age for the main optical / near - ir outflow of @xmath9 years , with large mass ejections occuring every 400 years or so @xcite , perhaps driven by fu orionis - type eruptions @xcite .",
    "however , as occurs with other hh flows ( e.g. hh 34 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , deep wide field images reveal that hh  46/47 extends at least 2.6  pc from the irs , and therefore must be @xmath10 years old @xcite .    in this paper we continue our investigation of stellar jet dynamics by presenting _ hst _",
    "proper motions of the optically emitting shocks in the hh  46/47 jet .",
    "the new observations were taken about 5 years after those in h96 , long enough for knots in the jet to move significantly , but short enough that morphological changes remain small for most of the knots .",
    "in addition to being able to quantify precession and differential motions in the jet with high precision , the new images make it possible to study the dynamics of a working surface in exquisite detail for the first time .",
    "we imaged the hh  47 jet through the f656n and the f673n filters with the wfpc-2 camera on _ hst _ on 26 february 1999 , a time interval of 4.9 years after the first epoch of images described by h96 .",
    "the images include the entire bright jet on one wf chip , with the extended bow shock hh  47d spread across the pc ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "three exposures each for h@xmath0 and [ s  ii ] facilitated cosmic - ray removal .",
    "total exposure times for the h@xmath0 and [ s  ii ] images in the 1999 epoch were 4100 seconds and 4000 seconds , respectively .",
    "we reduced the new images and aligned them with the previous epoch using the same procedures described in h96 .    a difference image between the two epochs ( fig .",
    "2 ) shows clearly that the jet and bow shocks move away from hh  47-irs . to measure proper motions we used a method described by @xcite , explained in more detail in @xcite",
    "the algorithm shifts two images to minimize the square of the difference of the counts over a region that defines the object .",
    "we examined each image for features that retained their overall shape between the two epochs and applied the procedure separately for h@xmath0 and for [ s  ii ] , because hh objects often have different morphologies when imaged in these two filters .",
    "figs .  3 and  4",
    "show objects in the jet , while figs .",
    "5 and  6 cover the hh  47a bow shock .",
    "variable features within hh  47a are emphasized in fig",
    "table  1 compiles proper motions of all the objects identified in the figures .",
    "coordinates in the table were obtained using the stsdas task xy2rd .",
    "errors in the proper motions come from imperfect alignment of the images between epochs , uncertainties in the centroiding routine that determines the spatial shifts , and errors in the distance to hh  47 . in the hh  47 images",
    "there are many field stars available to align the epochs , so uncertainties in the registration are small . using the proper motion code on stars",
    "after the images were aligned shows the rms error in the image registration is about 0.1 pixel .",
    "formal statistical errors in centroiding features are typically 0.05 pixel .",
    "however , an additional systematic error of @xmath4 0.1 pixel arises from using different buffer sizes to search for the centroid ( e.g. h96 ) .",
    "the distance to hh  47 derives from estimates of the distance to ngc  2547 ( 450 pc * ? ? ? * ) and to a group of coeval stars within about 5 degrees of the vela pulsar ( 425 pc * ? ? ?",
    "the projected distance of hh  47 from ngc  2547 is about 3 degrees , or 25  pc at a distance of 450  pc .",
    "we adopt 25  pc as the uncertainty in the distance , which introduces a 6%  error in the observed tangential velocities .    altogether ,",
    "internal errors in the proper motions over the 4.9 year interval between epochs are @xmath4 5 km@xmath2s@xmath3 , for all objects except the large , diffuse bow shock hh  47d , where the uncertainty is 40 km@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "the 6%  uncertainty in the distance is a multiplicative constant that affects all the measurements in the same way .",
    "proper motions in hh  47d derive from the sum of the h@xmath0 and [ s  ii ] images to improve the signal - to - noise .",
    "when combined with existing radial velocity information , our new proper motion measurements make it possible to calculate the orientation of the flow , its true space velocity , and to assess the degree to which clumpy flows and variations in the intrinsic velocity and in the ejection angles affect the jet dynamics .",
    "initial results from the analysis of these data were reported by @xcite .",
    "radial velocities along the jet observed by meaburn & dyson ( 1987 , their fig .",
    "2 ) increase from hh46  irs out to the hh  47a bow shock , and we observe the same behavior in the proper motions shown in fig .",
    "this correlation between radial velocities and proper motions implies that the jet varies intrinsically in velocity .",
    "the alternative explanation , that changes in the ejection angles cause the radial velocities and proper motions to change , is ruled out because in this model proper motions increase as radial velocities decrease and vice - versa for a constant velocity flow .",
    "the relatively poor spatial resolution of the ground - based radial velocity measurements makes it difficult to compare these directly with proper motions of specific emission features observed by _",
    "hst_. however , it is easy to identify the maximum radial velocity of the jet with respect to the cloud as being 200 @xmath1 10 km@xmath2s@xmath3 before the jet encounters hh  47a @xcite .",
    "we measure the proper motion of knot ah1 to be 300 @xmath1 18 km@xmath2s@xmath3 ( where the error is dominated by uncertainties in the distance ) , so this feature moves at an angle of 34 @xmath1 2 degrees from the plane of the sky , with a velocity of 360 @xmath1 28 km@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "because the jet is not straight , a long slit may miss some of the line emission in specific features and thereby give misleading estimates for the orientation angles . to obtain radial velocities for the entire emitting region one can use a slit map or observe with a fabry - perot , as was done by @xcite .",
    "using the datacube from that paper , the average radial velocity of the jet with respect to the cloud is 180 @xmath1 10 km@xmath2s@xmath3 . the average proper motion of the jet in fig .  8 is 235 km@xmath2s@xmath3 , with an intrinsic scatter of 10 km@xmath2s@xmath3 and a systematic error of 14 km@xmath2s@xmath3 from the distance .",
    "hence , the average orientation angle of the jet with respect to the plane of the sky is 37.5 @xmath1 2.5 degrees , in good agreement with the above measurement of ah1 and with previous estimates from ground - based proper motions @xcite .    as the last column of table  1 shows , the outer bow shock hh  47d is about 1300 years old , and hh  47a was ejected a little less than 800 years ago , assuming no significant deceleration of these objects has occurred .",
    "the average proper motion is @xmath4 235 km@xmath2s@xmath3 in the jet , @xmath4 200 km@xmath2s@xmath3 in hh  47a and @xmath4 180 km@xmath2s@xmath3 in hh  47d , so if this decline is caused by deceleration rather than source variability , then the amount of deceleration over the length of the jet is rather small compared with the velocity of the flow .",
    "the youngest knots in the jet are only a few decades old , and these knots have significantly higher proper motions than those ejected 150 @xmath11 200 years ago .    the hh  47 flow is an excellent place to observe how a jet with a variable ejection angle clears out a larger cavity .",
    "the inner 20 arcseconds of the hh  47 jet curves to the left in figs .  1 and  2 , but the proper motions are not along the jet . instead , the knots in the jet move away from the source radially , as expected for a jet with a variable ejection angle",
    "the current direction of the jet , defined by the motion of knots jh1 , jh2 , and js2 , is more northerly than its average over the past millennium .",
    "the reflection nebula along the cavity is also brighter on the northern side , as if the space between the irs and the northern cavity wall has been mostly cleared of dust , and fig .",
    "2 shows that this wall brightened between 1994 and 1999 .",
    "there is direct evidence that the jet currently collides with stationary material on this side of the cavity .",
    "a morphologically variable , but stationary , linear h@xmath0 feature noted by h96 has the spatial position and orientation expected if the jet were impacting the northern edges of the cavity obliquely .",
    "it is now possible to study deflection shocks in laboratory experiments that propagate jets into crosswinds @xcite .",
    "the hh  46/47 deflection shock is present only in h@xmath0 , and is marked in fig .",
    "shocks in stellar jets are caused by faster material overtaking slower material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "typical velocity variations along the hh  47 jet between adjacent knots are @xmath4 20 km@xmath2s@xmath3 , with a few cases up to 40 km@xmath2s@xmath3 , in agreement with shock models of the emission line ratios @xcite .",
    "two places in the flow will experience higher shock velocities in the future  proper motions in knot ah1 exceed those of hh  47a by about 100 km@xmath2s@xmath3 , so the true impact velocity should be @xmath4 125 km@xmath2s@xmath3 when this knot enters the working surface in about the year 2040 .",
    "this impact velocity should be large enough to generate [ o  iii ] line emission .",
    "the other area where proper motions change markedly is close to the source , where knots jh1 and jh2 have proper motions @xmath4 100 km@xmath2s@xmath3 higher than jh3 and other knots ahead in the flow .",
    "the first dynamical consequence of these large proper motions should be in about 30 years , when these knots encounter the current position of the deflection shock ( fig .",
    "hh  47a appears as a bow shock with a well - defined mach disk ( ah4 in fig .",
    "5 ) , and models of hh  47a have attempted to predict the emission line ratios and line widths using this scenario .",
    "based on the lack of [ o  iii ] @xmath125007 , the shock velocities in hh  47a are @xmath13 90 km@xmath2s@xmath3 @xcite , and the bow shock model that fits the line widths and the entire optical / uv spectrum the best is one where the bow shock has a velocity of 60 km@xmath2s@xmath3 and the mach disk 40 km@xmath2s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "while these shock velocities are generally consistent with the new proper motion data , it is clear that the dynamics within hh  47a is more complex than a simple bow shock / mach disk structure .",
    "figs .  5 , 6 , and  8",
    "show that individual clumps within hh  47a have different proper motions , and spread @xmath1 40 km@xmath2s@xmath3 or so relative to the mean motion of hh  47a .",
    "for example , knot ah8 clearly moves faster than the adjacent knot ah10 ( fig .",
    "7 ) , and table  1 confirms a relative velocity of @xmath4 40 km@xmath2s@xmath3 for these two knots .",
    "arrows in fig .",
    "7 mark two areas on the mach disk that have changed over the five years between the epochs .",
    "the changes could result from some sort of fluid instability , or could simply arise when a small dense blob like ah8 plunges through the mach disk .",
    "the area between the bow shock and the mach disk is particularly variable in fig .",
    "7 . in general , h@xmath0 , where the flux is determined largely by collisional excitation at the shock and",
    "so is proportional to the mass flux across the shock at any given moment , traces morphological changes more quickly than does [ s  ii ] , which radiates in a spatially extended zone that averages changes out over a cooling time of tens of years .",
    "we have measured precise proper motions from two epochs of _ hst _ images of the prototypical stellar jet hh  47 .",
    "uncertainties of the relative proper motions between knots are typically @xmath1 5 km@xmath2s@xmath3 , considerably lower than variations of the internal motions of the knots in the jet , so we can assess how the fluid dynamics operates in this system accurately for the first time .",
    "taking the source to be at a distance of 450  pc , the orientation angle of the flow is 37.5 @xmath1 2.5 degrees with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "the bright portion of the jet is about 800 years old , and has an average space velocity of 300 km@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "although the jet curves , the motion is primarily directed radially away from the source . the ejection angle of the jet varies with time by @xmath1 15 degrees or so , and currently impacts the northern side of the reflection nebula , where an oblique shock redirects the supersonic flow .",
    "proper motions in the jet increase with distance along the bright section of the jet in front of the bow shock hh  47a , similar to the behavior of radial velocities .",
    "this correlation implies that the source varies intrinsically in velocity , and it is these velocity variations that produce shocks that heat the jet internally .",
    "the observed variations in proper motion along the jet are consistent with shock models that were designed to explain the observed emission line ratios in the jet .    the bright bow shock hh  47a has a clear mach disk and bow shock , but the object is more complex than a dual shock structure , and has many clumps whose differential motions dominate much of the dynamics in this object .",
    "the region between the bow shock and mach disk has a highly variable morphology , and the mach disk also changed structure significantly over the five year interval between images .",
    "the individual knots within hh  47a are easiest to explain as small bullets that pass from the jet through the mach disk and working surface to emerge as bumps in the bow shock .",
    "understanding hh flow dynamics will require systematic work that spans decades , but the rewards are great because these objects make it possible to test our basic understanding of the time dependences of shocked supersonic flows , a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysics .",
    "additional epochs of high spatial resolution imaging of hh  47 will be able to follow the dynamics of this fascinating object in real time , and thereby provide ideal constraints for numerical models of working surfaces within collimated supersonic flows .",

    "<S> the jet curves , but motions of knots in the jet are directed radially away from the exciting source , and velocity variability in the flow drives the shock waves that heat the jet internally . </S>",
    "<S> the jet orientation angle varies with time by about 15 degrees , and currently points to the northwestern portion of a cavity outlined by a reflection nebula , where a quasi - stationary shock deflects the jet . </S>",
    "<S> the major working surface hh  47a is more complex than a simple bow shock / mach disk , and contains numerous clumps that move relative to one another with velocities of @xmath4 @xmath1 40 km@xmath2s@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> small clumps or instabilities affect the mach disk , and dense clumps may move all the way through the working surface to cause the bumpy morphology seen at the bow shock . </S>",
    "<S> a localized area between the bow shock and mach disk varies significantly between the two sets of images . </S>"
