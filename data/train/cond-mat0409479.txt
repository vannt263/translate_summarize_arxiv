    "the experimental achievements of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with various dilute trapped alkali - metal atom gases have opened new possibilities to investigate macroscopic quantum effects @xcite .",
    "indeed it is well known that phase coherence plays a crucial role in macroscopic quantum systems , and different systems have been addressed : josephson effect in superconductors @xcite , weakly linked superfluid he - b reservoirs @xcite , two coupled becs in a double well trap @xcite , and coupled condensates in different hyperfine levels @xcite . in this paper we shall address the quantum coherent tunneling between two becs trapped in a double - well potential , and we shall focus our attention to the influence of random external fluctuations . in superconductors the main origin of external noise is thermal or quantum fluctuations .",
    "mathematically the problem can be reduced to the _ pendulum _ equation ( sine - gordon equation ) with external fluctuations @xmath0 @xcite and the energy diffusion of the system can be studied .",
    "in particular stratonovich has studied this problem in the strong damping case @xmath1 @xcite .    in becs new types of problems",
    "appear due to the existence of the trap potential .",
    "coherent phase phenomena in coupled becs are described by a system of ordinary differential equations for the imbalance in atomic population @xmath2 and relative phase @xmath3 .",
    "this system can be considered as the equation for the _",
    "nonrigid pendulum_. the pendulum case recovered if the imbalance is small @xmath4 .",
    "nonrigidity leads to new phenomena , and we can distinguish two regimes in the atomic imbalance evolution .",
    "the first regime is the macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) , when the atomic population is periodically exchanged between wells with @xmath5 , which is analogous to the josephson effect .",
    "the second regime is the macroscopic quantum localization ( mql ) phenomena , when the mean field nonlinearity excesses some critical value , the mean value of the imbalance becomes nonzero @xmath6 , which corresponds to the localization of the atomic population in one of the wells in the form of small - amplitude oscillations around the bottom of the well .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the influence of fluctuations on the evolution of the system in these states .",
    "in particular we would like to pay a particular attention to the possible switching between these states .",
    "this problem has a general character and it is important for the theory of nonlinear directional couplers in nonlinear optics @xcite and nonlinear dimers @xcite .",
    "periodic variations of the parameters of the trap have already been considered , and resonant phenomena have been exhibited for the weakly - coupled bec @xcite and for the strongly overlapped bec @xcite .",
    "the influence of a periodic time - varying atomic scattering length was addressed in @xcite .",
    "dynamical tunneling between regions of regular motion was shown to be involved by strong periodic modulation of the tunnel coupling between the two modes @xcite .",
    "finally macroscopic quantum chaos driven by a time - periodic trap asymmetry was predicted in @xcite . in this work",
    "we shall study the influence of random fluctuations on the bec dynamics trapped in a double - well trap .",
    "we shall address the case of fluctuating zero point energies so that the energy difference @xmath7 is a zero - mean random process .",
    "such variations are induced by small oscillations in the barrier laser position @xcite .",
    "indeed , the barrier is generated by a gaussian laser sheet focused near the center of the harmonic trap and small oscillations of the barrier - laser position introduce the fluctuations of the zero - point energies .",
    "the problem of becs in a double - well time - dependent trap is described by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the double - well potential , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the atomic scattering length . for weakly overlapped condensates ( high barrier or well separated wells ) we can use the two - modes decomposition @xmath12 where @xmath13 are complex time - dependent amplitudes of condensates in wells and @xmath14 are approximate ground state solutions of gp equation in first and second wells respectively . substituting this solution into ( [ gp ] ) , multiplying the equation by @xmath15 and integrating over the spatial variable we obtain the system of equations for the two modes @xmath16 @xcite @xmath17 \\psi_1 - k \\psi_2 , \\\\ & & i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi_2}{\\partial t } = [ e_2(t)+ \\alpha_2 |\\psi_2|^2 ] \\psi_2 - k \\psi_1 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 are the zero point energies , @xmath19 is the coupling constant between the two modes , and @xmath20 are the mean field nonlinearities for both modes .",
    "here we take into account a small oscillation in the laser - barrier position so that @xmath21 is time - varying @xcite .",
    "we write @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the ( constant ) total number of atoms .",
    "the fractional population imbalance @xmath24 and the relative phase @xmath25 satisfy @xmath26 where we have rescaled to a dimensionless time @xmath27 and we have introduced new variables @xmath28 note that we have included the damping term @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sys1a ] ) that takes into account a non - coherent dissipative current of normal - state atoms , proportional to the chemical potential difference @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the unperturbed system ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) is @xmath32 @xmath33 can take any value between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is an integral of motion .",
    "the orbits of the motion are closed , corresponding to periodic oscillations . in order to explicit the periodic structure of the variables @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ", we introduce the action - angle variables .",
    "the orbits are completely determined by the energy @xmath33 imposed by the initial conditions .",
    "the period is denoted by @xmath36 , the motion is described by @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are smooth functions , periodic with respect to @xmath41 with period @xmath42 , the angle satisfies @xmath43 and the action is defined by @xmath44    the analysis is standard but quite cumbersome , so we only list the final results that can be written in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "we need to introduce a series of parameters .",
    "@xmath45 three cases can be distinguished .",
    "_ if @xmath46 , then @xmath47 , the period is @xmath48 where @xmath19 is the complete elliptic function @xcite , @xmath49 cn , sn , and dn are tabulated jacobian functions @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath38 is an even function with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "these solutions preserve the @xmath2-symmetry in the sense that they correspond to eigenfunctions of the gross - pitaevskii equation that are either odd or even functions . the stationary ground state has energy @xmath50 and it is given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 and the atomic population is periodically exchanged between the two modes .",
    "this is the mqt regime .",
    "if @xmath55 , then @xmath56 , the period is @xmath57 the three periodic functions @xmath38 , @xmath58 , and @xmath40 are given by @xmath59 note that @xmath38 is either always positive , or always negative - valued .",
    "these solutions correspond to eigenfunctions that break the @xmath2-symmetry .",
    "in particular there exist two stationary solutions with the maximal energy @xmath60 that are @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "their existences result from the nonlinear interatomic interaction and it is possible only when the number of atoms is large enough so that nonlinear coefficient @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath55 the population imbalance periodically oscillates around a non - zero average value @xmath6 .",
    "this is the mql regime .",
    "if @xmath64 , then @xmath65 , the motion is given , in this special case , by the non - oscillatory hyperbolic secant @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "in presence of a small damping an adiabatic approach is possible which yields that the energy decays as @xmath69 where @xmath70 @xmath71 vanishes at @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "it takes large values just above and below @xmath75 . in figure [ figdamp1 ]",
    "we plot the function @xmath76 for two different values of @xmath77 .",

    "in this paper we have considered the dynamics of two weakly - coupled becs .",
    "we have investigated the influence of small random oscillations of the barrier - laser position which induce fluctuations of the zero - point energies of the double - well trap .",
    "we have shown that random noise induces an energy diffusion which allows the system to visit symmetry - breaking states when the number of atoms ( proportional to @xmath77 ) exceeds a threshold value .",
    "we have shown that the energy distribution evolves to a stationary distribution which depends on the initial state of the bec only through the total number of atoms , and not through the initial imbalance or phase difference .",
    "we have computed the time necessary for the loss of memory of the initial conditions and the establishment of the stationary dynamics .",
    "then we have described the stationary dynamics of the bec which visits symmetric and symmetry - breaking states according to a random markovian dynamics .",
    "we have investigated the role of damping in this process .",
    "in particular we have shown that , for a given damping , there exists a critical value for the number of atoms where the proportion of time spent by the bec in symmetry - breaking states ( i.e. in a macroscopic quantum localization state ) is maximal .",
