    "in recent years , studies of transport phenomena in nonlinear systems have been attracting a growing interest . in particular ,",
    "a large and constantly growing number of papers are devoted to dynamics in systems which allow for directed [ on average ] motion under unbiased external forces and are referred to as ratchet systems .",
    "their intensive study was motivated by problems of motion of brownian particles in spatially periodic potentials , unidirectional transport of molecular motors in biological systems , and recognition of `` ratchet effects '' in quantum physics ( see review @xcite and references therein ) . generally speaking , ratchet phenomena occur due to lack of symmetry in the spatially periodic potential and/or the external forcing .",
    "it is interesting , however , to understand microscopic mechanisms leading to these phenomena .",
    "a possible approach is to neglect dissipation and noise terms and arrive at a hamiltonian system with deterministic forcing .",
    "thus , one can make use of results obtained and methods developed in the theory of hamiltonian chaos . many papers studying chaotic transport in such hamiltonian ratchets appeared in the last years ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , in @xcite",
    "the ratchet current is estimated in the case when there are stability islands in the chaotic domain in the phase space of the system .",
    "the borders of such islands are `` sticky '' @xcite and this stickiness together with desymmetrization of the islands are responsible for occurrence of the ratchet transport .",
    "we consider the problem of motion of a particle in a periodic harmonic potential @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the coordinate and @xmath2 , under the influence of unbiased time periodic external forcing .",
    "the equations are the same as in the paradigmatic model of a nonlinear pendulum under the action of external torque with zero time average .",
    "we study the case when the external forcing is a time - periodic function of large period of order @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and use results and methods of the adiabatic perturbation theory .",
    "if @xmath5 is small enough , there are no stability islands in the domain of chaotic dynamics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the mechanism of ratchet transport in this system differs from one suggested in @xcite .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to find a formula for the average velocity @xmath6 of a particle in the chaotic domain on very large time intervals .",
    "chaos in the system is a result of multiple separatrix crossings due to slow variation of the external forcing . at each crossing",
    "the adiabatic invariant ( `` action '' of the system ) undergoes a quasi - random jump ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we show that these jumps result in effective mixing and uniform distribution of the action along a trajectory in the chaotic domain . on the other hand , direction and value of velocity",
    "depends on the immediate value of the action .",
    "thus , to find the average velocity of transport on time intervals of order or larger than the mixing time , we find formulas for displacement in @xmath1 at a given value of the action and then integrate them over the interval of values of the action corresponding to the chaotic domain .",
    "we demonstrate that for an external force of general kind ( i.e. with zero time average but lowered time symmetry , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , there is directed transport in the system and obtain an analytic formula for the average velocity @xmath7 of this transport .    in section 2 ,",
    "we obtain the main equations in the case of external force of small amplitude and describe the diffusion of adiabatic invariant due to multiple separatrix crossings .",
    "this diffusion makes dynamics chaotic in a large domain of width of order 1 . in section 3",
    ", we derive the formula for the average velocity of transport on very long time intervals ( of order of typical diffusion time and larger ) and check it numerically . in section 4 , we consider the case when the external forcing is not small , of order 1 .",
    "width of the chaotic domain in this situation is large , of order @xmath3 . in this case chaos",
    "arises as a result of scattering of the adiabatic invariant on the resonance .",
    "formula for the average velocity of transport in this case turns out to be much simpler than in the case of external forcing of small amplitude .",
    "we start with a basic equation describing a nonlinear pendulum under the influence of an external force @xmath8 : + _ 0 ^ 2 q = f(t ) . [ 1.1 ] we assume that @xmath8 is small in amplitude periodic function of time of large period : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath8 is a function with zero time average .",
    "this system is hamiltonian , with time - dependent hamiltonian function h = - _ 0 ^ 2 q - f(t ) q. [ 1.2 ] we make a canonical transformation of variables @xmath11 using generating function @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "thus , @xmath14 is a periodic function defined up to an additive constant , which we are free to choose . to make the following presentation more clear , we choose this constant in such a way that the minimal value of @xmath15 is @xmath16 .",
    "note that @xmath17 .",
    "after this transformation , hamiltonian of the system acquires the form ( bars over @xmath1 are omitted ) : h = - _ 0 ^ 2 q. [ 1.3 ] phase portrait of the system at a frozen value of @xmath18 ( we call it the unperturbed system ) is shown in fig .  [ portrait ] .",
    "the separatrix divides the phase space into the domains of direct rotations ( above the upper branch of the separatrix ) , oscillations ( between the separatrix branches ) , and reverse rotations ( below the lower branch of the separatrix ) .",
    "introduce the `` action '' @xmath19 associated with a phase trajectory of the unperturbed system on this portrait . in the domains of rotation",
    ", @xmath19 equals an area between the trajectory , the lines @xmath20 , and the axis @xmath21 , divided by @xmath22 ; in the domain of oscillations , this is an area surrounded by the trajectory divided by @xmath22 .",
    "it is known that @xmath19 is an adiabatic invariant of ( [ 1.3 ] ) : far from the separatrix its value is preserved along a phase trajectory with the accuracy of order @xmath5 on long time intervals ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "location of the separatrix on the @xmath23-plane depends on the value of @xmath14 .",
    "as @xmath18 slowly varies , the separatrix slowly moves up and down , and phase points cross the separatrix and switch its regime of motion from direct rotations to reverse rotations and vice versa .",
    "recall known results on variation of the adiabatic invariant when a phase point crosses the separatrix .",
    "the area surrounded by the separatrix is constant , and hence , capture into the domain of oscillations is impossible in the first approximation ( in the exact system , only a small measure of initial conditions correspond to phase trajectories that spend significant time in this domain ; thus their influence on the transport is small ) . to be definite ,",
    "consider the situation when the separatrix on the phase portrait slowly moves down .",
    "thus , phase points cross the separatrix and change the regime of motion from reverse rotation to direct rotation .",
    "let the action before the separatrix crossing at a distance of order 1 from the separatrix be @xmath24 and let the action after the crossing ( also at a distance of order 1 from the separatrix ) be @xmath25 . in the first approximation , we have @xmath26 , i.e. the action increases by the value of the area enclosed by the separatrix divided by @xmath22 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we shall call this change in the action a `` geometric jump '' .",
    "if the separatrix contour slowly moves up , and a phase point goes from the regime of direct rotation to the regime of reverse rotation , the corresponding value of the action decreases by the same value @xmath27 .",
    "thus , in this approximation , the picture of motion looks as follows .",
    "while a phase point is in the domain of reverse rotation , the value of @xmath19 along its trajectory stays constant : @xmath28 .",
    "after transition to the domain of direct rotation , this value changes by the value of the geometric jump .",
    "the transition itself in this approximation occurs instantaneously . after the next separatrix",
    "crossing , the adiabatic invariant changes again by the value of the geometric jump , with the opposite sign , and returns to its initial value @xmath29 .",
    "we call this approximation adiabatic .    in the next approximation ,",
    "the value of action at the separatrix crossing undergoes a small additional jump .",
    "consider for definiteness the case when the separatrix contour on the phase portrait moves down , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are measured when it is in its uppermost and lowermost positions , accordingly .",
    "results of @xcite imply the following formula for the jump in the adiabatic invariant : 2(i_+ - i_- ) & = & 16_0 + 2a(1- ) ( ) + & + & a -2b(1- ) , where @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the @xmath18-derivative of @xmath15 , @xmath33 is the value of @xmath18 at the separatrix crossing found in the adiabatic approximation , @xmath34 is the gamma - function .",
    "value @xmath35 is a so - called pseudo - phase of the separatrix crossing ; it strongly depends on the initial conditions and can be considered as a random variable uniformly distributed on interval @xmath36 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , value of the jump in the adiabatic invariant at the separatrix crossings has a quasi - random component of order @xmath37 .",
    "accumulation of small quasi - random jumps due to multiple separatrix crossings produces diffusion of adiabatic invariant ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . on a period of @xmath14 ( after two separatrix crossings ) the action changes by a value of order @xmath37",
    "hence , after @xmath38 separatrix crossings the adiabatic invariant varies by a value of order one . as a result , in time of order @xmath39",
    "the value of adiabatic invariant is distributed in all the range of values corresponding to the domain where phase points cross the separatrix on the phase plane ; its distribution is close to the uniform one .",
    "we have checked this fact numerically for a sample function @xmath14 at various parameter values .",
    "poincar sections and distribution histograms of @xmath19 in all the cases look similar ; see an example in fig .",
    "[ density ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "to summarize , we have considered the phenomenon of the directed transport in a spatially periodic harmonic potential adiabatically influenced by a periodic in time unbiased external force .",
    "we have shown that for the external force of a general kind the system exhibits directed transport on long time intervals .",
    "direction and average velocity of the transport in the chaotic domain are independent of initial conditions and determined by properties of the external force .",
    "we studied two different cases : the case of small amplitude of the external force and the case , when this amplitude is a value of order one .",
    "we have obtained an approximate formula for average velocity of the transport and checked it numerically . the final formulas ( [ 2.9 ] ) and",
    "( [ 3.8 ] ) are valid for any smooth periodic potential ( not necessarily harmonic one ) .",
