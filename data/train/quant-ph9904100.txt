    "in recent proposals to perform quantum computation in nuclear spin systems using nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) techniques  @xcite , coupled logic operations are performed using spin - spin couplings that occur naturally in molecular systems . while this is straightforward for small systems with a few spins , generalization to complex molecular structures has been challenging .",
    "the complication is caused by the many spin - spin couplings which occur along with the desired one .",
    "this fundamental task to turn off spurious evolution is so difficult that , coercing a complex system to _ do nothing _  @xcite  ceasing all evolution  can be just as difficult as making it do something computationally useful .    the task of turning off all couplings is known in the art of nmr as _ decoupling _ ; doing this for all but a select subset of couplings is known as _",
    "selective recoupling_. a common method to perform these tasks is to interrupt the free evolution by carefully chosen pulses .",
    "these pulses are single spin-1/2 ( qubit ) operations that transform the hamiltonian in the time between pulses in such a manner that unwanted evolutions in consecutive time intervals cancel out each other .",
    "pulse sequences which perform selective recoupling are generally difficult to find for a large system .",
    "each pulse simultaneously affects many coupling terms in the hamiltonian . to turn off all but one of the coupling terms",
    ", these pulses have to satisfy many simultaneous requirements .",
    "ingenious sequences have been found for usual nmr applications  @xcite but they do not address the problems relevant to quantum computation . in usual nmr applications , the structure of the spin systems is not known a - priori .",
    "therefore , pulse sequences are designed to address all the spins together rather than individual spins .",
    "quantum computation brings new requirements , and initial efforts  @xcite have been made to develop pulse sequences to satisfy these needs ; however , to - date , schemes have necessitated resources ( such as total number of pulses applied ) exponential in the number of spins being controlled .",
    "in this paper , we present an _",
    "efficient _ scheme to perform selective recoupling .",
    "in contrast to the situation with traditional nmr , this scheme addresses the problem relevant to nmr quantum computation , in which the molecular structure is assumed to be well - known , and spins are individually addressible .",
    "the method is related to a class of well - known matrices called _",
    "hadamard matrices_. we derive from any @xmath4 hadamard matrix a pulse scheme that decouples @xmath0 spins using @xmath0 time intervals and @xmath5 pulses . this decoupling scheme can easily be modified ( i ) to remove zeeman evolution and ( ii ) to implement selective recoupling .",
    "this completes the construction for @xmath0 spins whenever @xmath4 hadamard matrices exist .",
    "when @xmath4 hadamard matrices do not exist , a scheme for @xmath0 spins can still be constructed using larger existing hadamard matrices . in doing so",
    ", an extra amount of effort is required , but this can be bounded using existence properties of hadamard matrices .",
    "altogether , the scheme requires @xmath1 time intervals and less than @xmath6 pulses , where @xmath3 with upper bound @xmath7 .",
    "our method applies whenever the spins couple pairwise and have very different zeeman frequencies , such as in heteronuclear spin systems .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : statement ] , we review relevant concepts in nmr quantum computing and re - state the problem precisely . in section  [ sec : scheme ] , we first motivate the construction of the decoupling scheme with examples , and then describe the general construction related to hadamard matrices .",
    "important properties of hadamard matrices are summarized .",
    "modifications of the decoupling scheme to perform selective recoupling are described .",
    "we conclude with some general remarks and discussions of various properties and limitations of the scheme .",
    "in this section , we describe the nmr system and describe how a universal set of ( non - fault tolerant ) operations  @xcite , namely , the single qubit operations and the controlled - not gate , can be realized using basic nmr primitives .",
    "we shall consider a physical system which consists of a solution of identical molecules .",
    "each molecule has @xmath0 non - magnetically equivalent nuclear spins which serve as qubits .",
    "a static magnetic field is applied externally along the @xmath8 direction .",
    "this magnetic field splits the energy levels of the spin states aligned with and against it .",
    "this is described in the hamiltonian by the zeeman terms , which , in the energy eigenbasis , are given by _ z = - _",
    "z^(i ) , [ eq : ham : zeeman ] where @xmath9 is the spin index , @xmath10 is the _ zeeman frequency _ for the @xmath9-th spin , and @xmath11 is the pauli matrix operating on the @xmath9-th spin .",
    "the convention @xmath12 is used for the rest of the paper . the spins have very different zeeman frequencies , a situation loosely termed as `` heteronuclear '' in this paper",
    ".    nuclear spins can interact via the dipolar coupling  @xcite .",

    "spin - spin coupling can also be mediated by coupling to electrons .",
    "this indirect coupling has a tensor part and a scalar part .",
    "the tensor part is usually of the same form as @xmath16 .",
    "the scalar part is given by the hamiltonian _",
    "i < j g_ij^s ^(i ) ^(j ) [ eq : scalar ] .",
    "if the molecules tumble fast and isotropically , dipolar coupling and indirect tensor coupling will be averaged away ; otherwise , the physics can be more complicated . however , in the presence of a strong external magnetic field , only the _ secular _ part ( terms that commute with @xmath17 ) is important  @xcite . for a heteronuclear system ,",
    "the resulting coupling becomes _",

    "single qubit operations are performed by applying _",
    "pulsed _ radio frequency ( rf ) magnetic fields along some directions @xmath18 perpendicular to the static field . to address the @xmath9-th spin , the frequency of the rf field is chosen to approximate @xmath10 .",
    "when the @xmath19 s are very different , very short pulses can be used , so that during the pulses , all other evolutions are negligible except for the rotation operator @xmath20 where @xmath21 is proportional to the pulse duration and the power .",
    "the lie group of all single qubit operations can be generated by rotations about @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "our scheme uses only rotations of @xmath24 along @xmath22 , which implement @xmath25 ( up to an irrelevant overall phase ) on the spins being addressed .",
    "we denote this operation by @xmath26 , superscripted by the spin index whenever appropriate .",

    "* 3 . * since the coupling is bilinear in the @xmath35 matrices , it is unchanged ( negated ) when the signs of the @xmath35 matrices agree ( disagree ) .",
    "the @xmath26 pulses therefore negate the coupling for exactly half of the time . +",
    "* 4 . * since the matrix exponents commute , negating the coupling for exactly half of the time suffices for the evolution to be cancelled out .",
    "the most crucial point leading to decoupling is that , the signs of the @xmath35 matrices of the coupled spins , controlled by pairs of @xmath26 pulses , disagree for half of the time .    in general , we consider pulse sequences which concatenate equal - time intervals and use @xmath26 pulses to control the signs of the @xmath35 of each spin .",
    "the essential information on the signs can be represented by a `` sign matrix '' defined as follows .",
    "the `` sign matrix '' of a pulse scheme for @xmath0-spins with @xmath38 time intervals is the @xmath39 matrix with the @xmath40 entry being the _ sign _ of @xmath11 in the @xmath41-th time interval .",
    "these sign matrices have one - to - one correspondence with our restricted class of pulse sequences .",

    "note that @xmath29 in @xmath46 now denotes the sum of six possible coupling terms for four spins .",
    "note also eq.([eq : dec4 ] ) is written in such a way that it corresponds visually to the sign matrix , though the evolutions are actually in reverse time order relative to @xmath43 .",
    "however , such ordering is irrelevant for commuting evolutions . since @xmath47 , eq.([eq : dec4 ] ) can be simplified to ( x^(3 ) x^(4 ) x^(4 ) ) ( x^(2 ) x^(3 ) ) ( x^(4 ) x^(2 ) x^(4 ) ) [ eq : dec4short ] .",
    "this simplified pulse sequence can also be obtained directly from eq.([eq : s4 ] ) by converting columns to time intervals and inserting @xmath48 between intervals whenever the @xmath9-th row changes sign or whenever a @xmath44 sign reaches either end of the row .",

    "note that the total time used to implement @xmath28 is the shortest possible , since the coupling is always `` on '' .",
    "the scheme requires @xmath81 time intervals .",
    "consequently , it requires at most @xmath93 pulses , since @xmath94 and the @xmath26 pulses are only used in pairs .",
    "the remaining question is : how does @xmath81 depend on @xmath0 ?",
    "for simplicity , we consider @xmath73 in place of @xmath81 . if hadamard matrices exist and can be constructed for all orders , @xmath95 .",

    "since @xmath64 exists by sylvester s construction , @xmath100 . we now show that @xmath101 is close to the ideal value 1 in most cases , due to the existence of hadamard matrices of orders other than powers of 2 .",

    "one arrives at the same conclusion by considering the gap @xmath102 , which bounds the extra number of intervals needed in the scheme caused by missing hadamard matrices . for @xmath80 , @xmath103 except for the few exceptional values of @xmath0 as a numerical fact . for completeness",
    ", we present arguments for @xmath3 for _ arbitrarily large _",
    "@xmath0 in appendix  [ sec : largen ] .",

    "if hadamard s conjecture is proven , @xmath104 @xmath105 .",
    "we reduce the problem of decoupling and selective recoupling in heteronuclear spin systems to finding sign matrices which is further reduced to finding hadamard matrices . while the most difficult task of constructing hadamard matrices is not discussed in this paper , solutions already exist in the literature . even more important is that the connection to hadamard matrices results in very efficient schemes .",
    "some properties of the scheme are as follows .",
    "first of all , the scheme is optimal in the following sense .",
    "the rows of hadamard matrices and their negations form the codewords of first order reed - muller codes , which are _ perfect codes _",
    "it follows that , for each hadamard matrix , it is impossible to add an extra row which is orthogonal to all the existing ones .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath0 , @xmath84 is in fact the minimum number of time intervals necessary for decoupling or recoupling , if one restricts to the class of pulse sequences considered .",
    "second , the scheme applies for arbitrary duration of the time intervals .",
    "this is a consequence of the commutivity of all the terms in the hamiltonian , which in turn comes from the large separations of the zeeman frequencies compared to the coupling constants .",
    "spin systems can be chosen to satisfy this condition .",
    "finally , disjoint pairs of spins can couple in parallel .",
    "we outline possible simplifications of the scheme for systems with restricted range of coupling .",
    "for example , a linear spin system with @xmath0 spins but only @xmath106-nearest neighbor coupling can be decoupled by a scheme for @xmath106 spins only .",
    "the @xmath9-th row of the @xmath107 sign matrix can be chosen to be the @xmath66-th row of @xmath108 , where @xmath109 .",
    "selective recoupling can be implemented using a decoupling scheme for @xmath110 spins .",
    "the sign matrix is constructed as in decoupling using @xmath111 but the rows for the spins to be coupled are chosen to be the @xmath110-th row different from all existing rows  @xcite .",
    "this method involving periodic boundary conditions generalizes to other spatial structures .",
    "the size of the scheme depends on @xmath106 and the exact spatial structure but not on @xmath0 .",
    "the scheme has several limitations .",
    "first of all , it only applies to systems in which spins can be individually addressed by short pulses and coupling has the simplified form given by eq.([eq : dipolar ] ) .",
    "these conditions are essential to the simplicity of the scheme .",
    "they can all be satisfied if the zeeman frequencies have large separations .",
