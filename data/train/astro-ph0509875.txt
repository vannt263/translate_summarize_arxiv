    "a recurring problem arising from the study of bright galaxy number counts has been the measured deficiency of galaxies around the southern galactic pole .",
    "this was first examined in detail by @xcite and subsequently by the apm galaxy survey @xcite , which observed a large deficit in the number counts ( @xmath450% at @xmath1816 , @xmath430% at @xmath1817 ) over a @xmath44000 deg@xmath1 solid angle .",
    "if this anomaly was due solely to features in the galaxy distribution , this would be at odds with recent measurements of the variance of local galaxy density fluctuations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the expected linear growth of density inhomogeneities at large scales .",
    "@xcite examined possible causes of this deficiency . from redshift",
    "survey results over the apm survey area @xcite , it was argued that a weak local under - density contributed to the observed deficiency at the 10% level at @xmath1917 .",
    "instead , @xcite suggested that strong low redshift galaxy evolution was the dominant contribution .",
    "this phenomenon has also been suggested as a possible explanation for large deficiencies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although models without such strong low redshift evolution provide predictions consistent with observed number redshift distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , @xcite argued that evolution could not account for the observed slope and that large - scale structure was the principal cause of the deficiency in the counts .",
    "however , another possible contribution to the low counts might be errors in the apm photometry . comparing the photographic apm photometry with @xmath6-band ccd data",
    ", @xcite detected a small residual scale error in the apm survey zeropoints for @xmath617 . correcting for this offset ,",
    "the counts were now in good agreement with homogeneous predictions at faint magnitudes ( @xmath617.5 ) ; however , the problematic deficiency at brighter magnitudes remained .",
    "more recently , @xcite used @xmath6-band ccd data over @xmath4337 deg@xmath1 within the apm survey area to provide the most accurate comparison to date with a sample of the apm survey photometry .",
    "the photometric zeropoint of this ccd data was in excellent agreement with the millennium galaxy catalogue @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey early data release @xcite .",
    "however , a comparison with the apm photometry suggested a large offset of 0.31 magnitudes for @xmath2017.35 . applying this to the apm survey counts , a deficiency of @xmath425% remained at @xmath1816 ; @xcite determined that such a deficiency in the local galaxy distribution would still be at odds with a @xmath15cdm form to the galaxy correlation function and power spectrum at large scales .    in order to examine this issue independently ,",
    "bright number counts have also been examined in the near infrared @xcite .",
    "these wavelengths are particularly useful for such analysis as the number count predictions are fairly insensitive to the evolutionary model or the assumed cosmology at bright magnitudes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) ; current observations are in remarkable agreement with predictions in the @xmath21-band to @xmath2223 for example @xcite in particular , @xcite examined @xmath7-band number counts selected from the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "first , the counts over the apm survey area were determined ; a similar deficiency was observed to the apm survey counts ( with the zeropoint offset determined by @xcite applied ) , with a @xmath425% deficit at @xmath2312 compared to the no evolution model of @xcite . using a @xmath15cdm form for the angular correlation function at large scales and assuming the observed counts were solely due to features in the local galaxy distribution , the observed counts represented a @xmath24 fluctuation .",
    "however , this result was complicated by the fact that the 2mass @xmath7-band number counts for almost the entire survey ( @xmath820@xmath9 , covering @xmath427@xmath10000 deg@xmath1 ) were also low , with a constant deficiency of @xmath420% between @xmath2310 and @xmath2313.5 .    did this surprising result perhaps indicate that the @xmath7-band @xcite model normalisation was too high ? or",
    ", as suggested previously , could low redshift luminosity evolution significantly affect the bright counts ?",
    "these issues were also addressed by @xcite : first , the @xcite model was compared with faint @xmath21-band data collated from the literature .",
    "fitting in the magnitude range 14@xmath2518 it was found that the best fit model normalisation was slightly too high , although not significantly ( this magnitude range was used so as to avoid fluctuations in the counts arising from large - scale structure at bright magnitudes and significant effects from galaxy evolution at the faint end ) .",
    "accounting for the normalisation uncertainty ( of @xmath126% ) the observed deficiency in the @xmath7-band counts over the apm survey area still represented a @xmath26 fluctuation .",
    "second , the issue of low redshift luminosity evolution was also addressed : 2mass galaxies below @xmath27 were matched with the northern and southern areas of the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dgrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting @xmath28 , covering @xmath29 deg@xmath1 in total , was consistent with the no evolution model of @xcite .",
    "in addition , these @xmath7-band redshift distributions were used to form predictions for the number counts over the northern and southern 2dfgrs areas respectively .",
    "this was done by multiplying the luminosity function parameter @xmath30 ( which governs the model normalisation ) used in the @xcite model by the relative density observed in the @xmath7-band @xmath28 as a function of redshift .",
    "these ` variable @xmath30 models ' were then compared with 2mass counts extracted for the 2dfgrs areas in order to determine whether the observed counts were consistent with being due solely to features in the local galaxy distribution ; the variable @xmath30 models were in good agreement with the number counts , indicating that low redshift luminosity evolution is unlikely to have a significant impact on the observed deficiency in the counts , in the @xmath7-band at least .",
    "in this paper we aim to address the issue of low , bright number counts in the near infrared @xmath0-band .",
    "in particular we wish to address a drawback to the @xmath7-band analysis of @xcite - the issue of the number count model normalisation ; while the @xmath7-band model used was compared with faint data and was found to be in good agreement , the level to which systematic effects , arising perhaps via zeropoint offsets between the bright and faint data or cosmic variance in the faint data , might affect the conclusions were uncertain .",

    ", we first verify that the @xmath0-band counts provide number counts over the apm survey area which are consistent with the previous results in the @xmath6 and @xmath7-bands @xcite , and that the form of the counts is not significantly affected by low redshift luminosity evolution through comparisons with the variable @xmath30 models described above . in section 3 ,",
    "we provide details of the data reduction of the new faint @xmath0-band photometry .",
    "the associated counts are presented in section 4 . in section 5",

    "the near infrared has the advantage of being sensitive to the underlying stellar mass and is much less affected by recent star formation history than optical wavelengths .",

    "the low @xmath820@xmath9 counts raise the question as to whether systematic effects are significant , or whether these counts are due to real features in the local galaxy distribution , as suggested by the agreement between the variable @xmath30 models and corresponding counts in fig .",

    "could unexpectedly high levels of luminosity evolution at higher redshifts affect our interpretation of the bright counts ?",

    "also , recent evidence from the combo-17 survey , examining the evolution of early - type galaxies using nearly 5000 objects to @xmath53 @xcite , suggests that density evolution will also not contribute ; @xmath30 appears to decrease with redshift indicating that the number of objects on the red sequence increases with time , and so acts contrary to the low counts observed at bright magnitudes .",

    "[ fig : fig5 ] and [ fig : fig6 ] ) also indicate that there is no evidence of scale error in either of the faint samples to @xmath62 .",
    "could the discrepancy between the bright and faint counts arise from an under - estimation of the total flux of the galaxies ? recall that we make no correction to total magnitude for the faint data presented in this work ; however , under - estimating the total flux in the faint data would only increase the observed deficit in the counts at bright magnitudes , if the model normalisation is adjusted to fit the faint counts .",

    "another possible contribution to the low counts could be high levels of incompleteness in the 2mass survey . as with the possible systematic effects described previously , it is differing levels of completeness in the faint and bright data which would be important .",
    "the 2mass literature quotes the extended source catalogue completeness as @xmath63% ( see the 2mass website for example ) .",
    "independently , @xcite suggest that the level of completeness is high ( @xmath499% ) , determined via comparisons with the sdss early data release spectroscopic data and the 2dfgrs .",
    "the faint data presented in this work and the lcirs data are likely to suffer less from incompleteness , as we cut well below the magnitude limit , are subject to lower levels of stellar confusion and suffer less from low resolution effects .",
    "incompleteness in 2mass will therefore affect the observed deficit in the bright counts at the @xmath14% level , although the effect is likely to be at the low end of this constraint due to incompleteness in the faint catalogues and suggestions that the 2mass extended source catalogue is fairly complete .",
    "it appears therefore , that the observed deficiency in the bright counts might be significantly affected by incompleteness in the 2mass extended source catalogue .",
    "however , the level to which other systematic effects such as the model normalisation , luminosity evolution and photometry issues appears to be small .",
    "the question then is @xmath64 accounting for these various sources of error or uncertainty , are the deficiencies in the bright @xmath0-band counts over the apm survey area and for @xmath65 still at odds with the expected fluctuations in the counts arising from local large - scale structure in a @xmath15cdm cosmology , as suggested in previous work @xcite ?    we determine the expected fluctuations in the bright number counts due to cosmic variance via @xmath15cdm mock 2mass catalogues ; these are described in detail in @xcite . to recap",
    ", we apply the 2mass selection function to 27 virtually independent volumes of @xmath66  formed from the 3000@xmath67mpc@xmath68 @xmath15cdm hubble volume simulation .",
    "this simulation has input parameters of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the mean number density of the counts at the magnitude limit is set to that of the observed 2mass density .",
    "we are now in a position to estimate the significance of the observed bright @xmath0-band counts .",
    "we use the 1@xmath49 fluctuation in the counts expected in a @xmath15cdm cosmology ( determined using the 2mass mocks described above ) , which for the apm survey area is 7.63% ( for @xmath73 ) and 4.79% ( for @xmath56 ) , and for @xmath65 is 3.25% ( for @xmath73 ) and 1.90% ( for @xmath56 ) .",
    "in addition we also take into account the uncertainty in the model normalisation ; we use the best fit normalisation of the @xcite pure luminosity evolution model ( a factor of 1.095 above the @xcite model ) and add the uncertainty of @xmath123.1% derived from the faint @xmath0-band counts ( presented in fig .  [ fig : fig8 ] ) in quadrature . regarding the possible effect arising from survey incompleteness",
    ", we first assume that the level of incompleteness is comparable in the faint and bright data ; the resulting significance for the apm survey area and @xmath65 bright counts are shown in column 3 of table  [ table : defsig ] .",
    "this represents an upper limit on the significance since we have effectively assumed that there is no difference in the incompleteness between the bright and faint datasets . in column 4 of table  [",
    "table : defsig ] , we assume that there is a difference in the completeness levels in the faint and bright data of 10% .",
    "this represents a lower limit on the significance ( assuming that there are no further significant systematic effects ) , since we assume that the completeness of the 2mass extended source catalogue is 90% ( the lower limit ) and that there is no incompleteness in the faint data .",
    "therefore , assuming a @xmath15cdm cosmology , it appears that the observed counts over the apm survey area might be in line with a rare fluctuation in the local galaxy distribution .",
    "however , the counts over 66% of the sky ( @xmath65 ) suggest a deficiency in the counts that are at odds with @xmath15cdm , even accounting for a 10% incompleteness effect and the measured uncertainty in the best fit model normalisation .     & & ( no incompleteness & ( assuming 10% + & & correction ) & incompleteness ) + apm & @xmath74 & 3.7@xmath49 & 2.5@xmath49 + apm & @xmath75 & 4.2@xmath49 & 2.4@xmath49 +   + @xmath65 & @xmath74 & 6.1@xmath49 & 3.8@xmath49 + @xmath65 & @xmath75 & 6.8@xmath49 & 4.0@xmath49 +",
    "we have presented new @xmath0-band photometry over two fields with a combined solid angle of 0.30 deg@xmath1 to @xmath3319 .",
    "the zeropoint is chosen to match that of the 2mass photometry at the bright end and is accurate to @xmath120.01 magnitudes .",
    "in addition we have examined the faint @xmath0-band data of the lcirs @xcite which covers two fields with a combined solid angle of 0.39 deg@xmath1 to @xmath3320 .",
    "the zeropoint of this data appears to be offset from the 2mass photometry by 0.28@xmath120.01 magnitudes . applying a consistent zeropoint , the faint counts determined from the new data presented in this work and the lcirs are in good agreement with the pure luminosity evolution model of @xcite , with a best fit normalisation a factor of 1.095@xmath13 higher .",
    "in contrast , the bright @xmath0-band counts extracted from 2mass over the @xmath44000 deg@xmath1 apm survey area around the southern galactic pole are low with respect to this model , corroborating previous results over this area in the optical @xmath6-band and near infrared @xmath7-band @xcite . in addition",
    ", the counts extracted for almost the entire survey , covering 66% of ths sky , are also low with a deficit of @xmath76% to @xmath11 . importantly",
    ", this discrepancy does not appear to be due to zeropoint differences between the faint and bright data or uncertainty in the model normalisation set by the faint counts .",
    "we have investigated various possible sources of systematic error which might affect this result : the counts are consistent with low levels of luminosity and density evolution , as predicted by the pure luminosity evolution model of @xcite , to extremely faint magnitudes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . also , the photometry appears to be consistent between the faint and bright @xmath77 data using a zeropoint applied via comparisons between point sources .",
    "however , differing incompleteness in the bright and faint galaxy samples might have a significant impact ; completeness in the 2mass extended source catalogue is @xmath63% .    finally , we determined the expected cosmic variance in the bright number counts from @xmath15cdm mock 2mass catalogues .",
    "allowing for the model normalisation uncertainty determined from the faint counts , and using an upper limit on the incompleteness in the 2mass galaxy sample , the deficiency in the counts over the apm survey area represent a rare ( @xmath41 in 100 ) fluctuation in a @xmath15cdm cosmology .",
    "however , the low @xmath0-band counts for @xmath65 suggest that this deficiency might extend over the entire local galaxy distribution ; allowing for incompleteness and the model normalisation uncertainty as before , this would represent a 4@xmath49 fluctuation ( @xmath421 in 10@xmath10000 ) in the local galaxy distribution , and would therefore be at odds with the expected form of clustering expected in a @xmath15cdm cosmology on large scales .",
    "the increase in faint near infrared data from the uk infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) should help to resolve this issue .",
    "the new data presented in this paper were based on observations collected at the centro astronmico hispano alemn ( caha ) at calar alto , operated jointly by the max - planck institut fr astronomie and the instituto de astrofca de andaluca ( cisc ) .",
    "this publication also makes use of data products from the 2 micron all - sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis centre / california institute of technology , funded by the aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
    "we thank peter draper for his help with sextractor .",
    "we also thank the wonderful phil outram and john lucey for useful discussion and nicholas ross for assistance with the calar alto field selection .",
