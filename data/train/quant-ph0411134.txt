    "the entanglement between different particles has recently become a focus of activity in quantum physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , because of experiments on non - local features of quantum mechanics and the development of quantum information physics .",
    "einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) entangled states with two particles have been employed not only to test bell s inequality @xcite , but also to realize quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "also , entanglement plays a central quantitative role in quantum parallelism @xcite .",
    "the demonstrations of quantum entanglement to date are usually based on various probabilistic processes , e.g. , the generation of photon pairs in parametric down conversion @xcite . however , it is very difficult to generate the entanglement of larger numbers of particles , as the probability of randomly generating the appropriate conditions decreases exponentially with the number of particles .",
    "intense activities are now focused on generating an entanglement of particles in a deterministic way , i.e. , to produce a desired entangled state . for example , the entanglements of two and four trapped ions have been produced experimentally @xcite . as first suggested by cirac and zoller @xcite ,",
    "a very promising scenario for implementing a practical quantum information processor is the system of laser - cooled trapped ions , due to its long coherence time @xcite .",
    "information in this system is stored in the spin states of an array of trapped cold ions and manipulated by using laser pulses .",
    "the ions are held apart from one another by their mutual coulomb repulsion .",
    "each ion can be individually addressed by focusing laser beams on the selected ion .",
    "the collective normal modes of oscillation shared by all of the ions form the information bus , through which all gate operations can be performed . in the past few years",
    ", several key features of the proposal in @xcite , including the production of entangled states and the implementation of quantum controlled operations between a pair of trapped ions , have already been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "also , several alternative theoretical schemes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have been developed for overcoming various difficulties in realizing a practical ion - trap quantum information processor .",
    "the lamb - dicke ( ld ) approximation is made in _",
    "almost all _ of these schemes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , in order to simplify the treatment of the laser - ion interaction .",
    "this approximation requires that the coupling between the external and internal degrees of freedom of the ion is very weak , i.e. , the spatial dimension of the motion of the ground state of the trapped ion should be much smaller than the effective wavelength of the applied laser field ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in the ld limit the interaction between the internal states @xmath0 and the external motional harmonic oscillator states @xmath1 of the ion can be expanded to the lowest order of the ld parameter @xmath2 , then the usual jaynes - cummings ( jc ) or anti - jc - type model can be derived .",
    "however , the quantum motion of the trapped ions is _ not _ limited to the ld regime @xcite .",
    "inversely , utilizing the laser - ion interaction beyond this limit could be helpful for reducing the noise in the trap and improving the cooling rate ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it would be useful to implement the trapped - ion quantum information processing outside the ld regime .",
    "in fact , several schemes @xcite@xcite have been proposed to implement the quantum computation with trapped ions beyond the ld limit by sequently applying a series of pulses . in this work ,",
    "we propose an alternative scheme for manipulating quantum information , e.g. realizing quantum controlled operations and generating entanglement , of two trapped ions _ beyond _ the ld limit by using a pair of synchronous laser pulses .",
    "the information bus , i.e , the center - of - mass ( cm ) vibrational quanta of the ions , for communicating different ions , may be either in its ground or an arbitrary excitation state .",
    "neither the auxiliary atomic level nor the lamb - dicke approximation are needed in this work .",
    "the experimental realization of this simple approach is discussed .",
    "the ion trap quantum information processor consists of a string of ions stored in a very cold linear radio - frequency trap .",
    "the motion of the ions , which are coupled together due to the coulomb force between them , is quantum mechanical in nature .",
    "the ions are sufficiently separated apart ( see , e.g. @xcite ) to be easily addressed by different laser beams , i.e. , each ion can be illuminated individually by a separate leaser beam .",
    "the communication and logic operations between qubits are usually performed by exciting or de - exciting quanta of the collective vibration ( i.e. , the shared phonon ) modes , which act as the information bus ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider an array of @xmath3 two - level cold ions of mass @xmath4 trapped in a one - dimensional harmonic potential of frequency @xmath5 .",
    "the ions are able to perform small oscillations around their equilibrium position @xmath6 , due to the repulsive coulomb force between them .",
    "each one of the ions is assumed to be individually addressed by a separate laser beam .",
    "we consider the case where an arbitrary pair ( labeled by @xmath7 ) of trapped cold ions from the chain of @xmath3 trapped cold ions are illuminated independently by two weak classical laser beams .",
    "this is different from the scheme proposed in @xcite of using raman lasers to drive the ions .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to our situation is    @xmath8\\}+h.c.\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath5 and @xmath9 are the frequencies of the collective center - of - mass ( cm ) vibrational motion ( @xmath10 ) and the higher normal modes ( @xmath11 ) of the trapped ions , respectively ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the ladder operators of cm mode , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the ladder operators of the higher normal modes .",
    "@xmath16 is the carrier rabi frequency , which describes the coupling strength between the laser and the @xmath17th ion and is proportional to the strength of the applied laser . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are pauli operators , @xmath20 is the energy separation of the two internal states @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the ion , and @xmath23 is the initial phase of the applied laser beam .",
    "the ld parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 account for the coupling strength between the internal state of the @xmath17th ion and the vibrational states of the cm mode and the higher frequency modes , respectively .",
    "expanding eq .",
    "( 1 ) in terms of creation and annihilation operators of the normal modes , we can rewrite the hamiltonian of system in the interaction picture as    @xmath26\\right]\\hspace{-0.2cm}+h.c.\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath27.\\ ] ]    we assume that the frequencies of the applied lasers to be tuned resonantly on the same lower red - sidebands of the center - of - mass ( cm ) vibrational mode , i.e. , the frequencies @xmath28 of the applied lasers are chosen to be @xmath29 . then , like the procedure described in @xcite , we make the usual rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) and have the following effective hamiltonian    @xmath30    for small @xmath31 values .",
    "the operator function @xmath32 \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{(i\\eta_j^l)^{2n}}{(n!)^2}\\hat{b}_l^{\\dagger n } \\hat{b}_l^{n},\\ ] ] involving the number operators related to the higher-@xmath33 normal modes ( @xmath11 ) , is irrelevant because we are considering the weak excitation regime ( @xmath34 , i.e. , the intensity of the applied laser beams is assumed to be sufficiently weak ) .",
    "thus , hereafter we neglect all off - resonant transitions and the excitations of the higher vibrational modes @xcite , i.e. , let @xmath35 , and only label the cm mode excitations .",
    "we stress the following important fact : the effective hamiltonian ( 3 ) reduces to that in previous works ( e.g. , @xcite under the usual ld approximation : @xmath36 ) , to the lowest order of the ld parameter @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath37 is the occupation number of the fock state of the cm vibrational quanta .",
    "also , the hamiltonian ( 3 ) reduces to that in @xcite for @xmath38 . in order to manipulate a pair of trapped ions outside the ld regime , we now wish to solve the quantum dynamical problem associated with the above hamiltonian ( 3 ) _ without _ using the ld approximation .",
    "all operations presented below are based on this solution and do not involve quantum transitions to auxiliary atomic levels . without loss of generality , the information bus ( i.e. , the cm vibrational mode of the ions ) is assumed to be prepared beforehand in a pure quantum state , e.g. , the fock state @xmath39 with @xmath40 . during the time - evolution @xmath41",

    "for example , for the case where @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( i.e. , the ions are excited by blue - sideband laser beams with equal frequencies instead of red - sideband ones ) , the effective hamiltonian and the relevant dynamics of the system can be easily obtained from eq .",
    "( 3 ) and eqs .",
    "( 4 - 6 ) by making the replacements : @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "based on the conditional quantum dynamics for the two - qubit system derived in the previous section , we now show how to effectively manipulate two - qubit quantum information stored in two ions by applying a pair of simultaneous laser pulses .",
    "generally , the motion state entangles with the spin states during the dynamical evolution .",
    "we afterwards focus on how to decouple them and realize _ in one step _ and beyond the ld limit : either a two - qubit controlled operation or an entanglement between the trapped ions .",
    "the state of the information bus ( cm mode ) remains in its initial state , which is not entangled with the qubits after the operations .",
    "this is achieved by properly setting up the controllable experimental parameters , e.g. , the lamb - dicke parameters @xmath24 , the efficient rabi frequencies @xmath67 , the frequencies @xmath28 ( @xmath68 ) and the duration of the applied synchronous pulses .      as one of the simplest universal two - qubit quantum gates , the @xmath69 logic operation between the @xmath70st and the @xmath71nd ions    @xmath72    means that if the first ion is in the state @xmath73 , the operation has no effect , whereas if the control qubit ( first ion ) is in the state @xmath74 , the state of the second ion is rotated by the pauli operator @xmath75 .",
    "the first qubit is the control qubit and the second one is the target qubit .",
    "the @xmath69 operation is also known as controlled - rotation ( crot ) .",
    "it is seen from eqs .",
    "( 4 - 6 ) that the @xmath76 gate can be implemented exactly by a _",
    "one - step _ operation , if the experimental parameters are set up so that the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied , @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the duration of the two applied synchronous pulses .",
    "notice that the second condition in ( 8) , on @xmath79 , is equivalent to requiring @xmath80 , which forces @xmath81 due to normalization .",
    "the information bus remains in its initial state after the operation . without loss of generality ,",
    "we give some solutions of the conditional equations ( 8) for @xmath82 in table i.    we see from the table i that both the small and large , both the negative and positive , values of the ld parameters may be chosen to satisfy the conditions ( 8) for realizing the desired two - qubit controlled gate",
    ". our approach does not assume the ld approximation where @xmath83 for @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the present scheme can operate outside the ld regime and @xmath24 can be large . according to previous works ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it is known that an exact two - qubit gate @xmath84 surrounded by two one - qubit rotations on the target qubit can give rise to an exact two - qubit cnot gate @xmath85 .",
    "the present work shows that the cnot gate between different ions can be realized by using a _ three - step _ pulse process , which is simpler than the previous schemes which usually employed either _ five _ pulses @xcite , _ six _ pulses @xcite or _",

    "the shortest duration of the applied synchronous pulses for realizing the above manipulations of two trapped ions is about @xmath218 seconds , of the same order of the gate speed operating in the ld regime @xcite , for @xmath219hz @xcite .",
    "of course , to excite only the chosen sidebands of the cm mode , the spectral width of the applied laser pulse has to be sufficiently small .",
    "it might seem at first , from the above numerical results , that the present scheme for realizing the desired gate operation can not be easily implemented , as the relevant experimental parameters should be set up accurately .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "simple numerical analysis shows that the lowest probability of realizing the desired operation is still very high , even if the relevant parameters can not be set up exactly .",
