    "similar to dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath7 , strong anisotropic behaviors are observed in dy - tkl that the magnetization quickly saturates at a plateau of 5.1 @xmath55/ dy@xmath8 , which is about half of its effective moment . in the pyrochlore spin ice ,",

    "moreover , the magnetization curve of er - tkl is also very similar to that of its pyrochlore cousin er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath7 for the whole field region from 0 to 6.5 t. this similarity provides a supporting evidence for the local xy anisotropy that has been confirmed in the er pyrochlore .",
    "for the kagome lattice described in the main text , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are basis vectors of the triangular bravais lattice where there are three basis sites in a unit cell for an upright triangle of basis spins , labeled as blue , red and green . the nearest distance between two spin are thus @xmath63 = @xmath64 .",

    "typically the minima lie on high symmetry lines , we evaluate all possible periodicities of the magnetic state .",
    "the eigenvectors are decomposed to find the magnitude of moments on each of the three spins , if these are normalizable to the same constant we have an acceptable solution .",
    "the case of a degenerate eigenvalue is subtle and often comes up in our analysis . in this case",
    ", we perform a test : if no linear combination of the eigenvectors can be found leading to an equal normalization of the three spins , then the solution is unphysical and must be discarded . whenever the minimizing wave vector is different from @xmath86 or m point of the bz , the solution found by this method is analogous to a mean field spin density wave .",
    "since the magnitudes of the spins , which is given by the real part of the wave , must vary in magnitude at different sites , this does not fulfill the conditions of luttinger and tisza .",

    "<S> introduction. _ the two - dimensional ( 2d ) kagome lattice magnet ( klm ) has been a favorite in the theoretical condensed matter community since the experimental work on scgo @xcite , due to the strong frustration associated with its network of corner - shared triangles . </S>",
    "<S> many exotic states are predicted , such as the quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) state @xcite , the spin - orbital liquid state @xcite , the kagome spin ice ( ksi ) state @xcite , dipolar spin order @xcite , the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) phase transition @xcite , quantum order by disorder ( qobd ) @xcite , and nematicity and supernematicity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the large variety of exotic states predicted for kagome spin systems lies in contrast to a paucity of experimental systems . </S>",
    "<S> early efforts include the exploration of langasites re@xmath1ga@xmath4sio@xmath2@xcite , which possess a distorted kagome lattice . </S>",
    "<S> recent attention has been paid to vesignieite bacu@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath5(oh)@xmath0 @xcite and herbertsmithite zncu@xmath1(oh)@xmath6cl@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the later one shows intriguing signs of qsl behavior @xcite . from a materials standpoint , however , these two systems are limited by ( i ) known defect prone structures @xcite , and ( ii ) the inability to substitute facilely on the magnetic site ( e.g with non - heisenberg spins ) to realize states other than the qsl . clearly then </S>",
    "<S> , finding new klm - containing compounds with spin - type variability is a challenge of the highest order .    </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , a 2d klm is naturally contained in the frustrated 3d pyrochlore structure . in pyrochlores re@xmath0x@xmath0o@xmath7 ( re = rare earth element , x = transition metal element ) , both the re@xmath8 and x@xmath9 sublattices form alternating kagome and triangular layers along the [ 111 ] axis as a result of the corner - shared tetrahedrons ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the strong inter - layer interaction enforces three - dimensionality . </S>",
    "<S> an exception is found in studies of dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath7 in a [ 111 ] magnetic field , which polarizes the triangular layer spins , effectively decoupling the kagome planes , leading to a ksi state @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> obviously , if one can remove the magnetic moment of the triangular layer in the pyrochlore lattice , a re@xmath8 kagome - only lattice might be realized , enabling the study of intrinsic kagome physics . </S>",
    "<S> because of various spin and spin anisotropies of different re@xmath8 ions , exotic and rich magnetic properties should be immediately available via the complex interplay among the spin - orbital coupling , dipolar interaction , and exchange couplings . in pyrochlores , for example , this interplay leads to multi-@xmath10 ordering @xcite with multiple field induced transitions @xcite for heisenberg spins in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath7 , the spin ice state @xcite for ising spins in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath7 @xcite and dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath7 @xcite , and qobd physics in the xy spin system er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath7 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , what will be the magnetic ground states in the re - based klms ?    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we have created such a klm - mg@xmath0re@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 based on partial ion substitution in the pyrochlore lattice . here </S>",
    "<S> , the triangular layers in the pyrochlore structure are occupied by non - magnetic mg@xmath11 ions , leaving the re@xmath8-kagome layer well isolated from neighboring layers . </S>",
    "<S> we studied three representative systems ( re = gd , dy , er ) by dc- , ac - susceptibility ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , and specific heat ( c@xmath14 ) measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we present a spin hamiltonian and show the fundamental differences in collective behavior between the 2d klms and their 3d pyrochore cousins .    _ </S>",
    "<S> structure. _ sample synthesis method and measurement setups are described in the supporting material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mg@xmath0re@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( re = gd , dy , er ) structure is rhombohedral with r-3 m space group in hexagonal expression . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the pyrochlore lattice , the triangular layers of both the re@xmath8 and sb@xmath15 sublattices in the klm structure are occupied by mg@xmath11 ( the mg@xmath11 site can also be replaced by co@xmath11 @xcite , mn@xmath11 @xcite and zn@xmath11 @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the chemical formula can also be written as ( mg@xmath16re@xmath17)@xmath0(mg@xmath16sb@xmath17)@xmath0o@xmath18 , which is a pyrochlore ( re@xmath0x@xmath0o@xmath7 ) structure with @xmath19 re@xmath8 and x@xmath9 ions substituted in an ordered manner ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that for the x - ray diffraction pattern of mg@xmath0re@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite , the strongest peak for pyrochlore at 2@xmath20 @xmath21 30@xmath3 disappears completely and splits into two peaks , providing evidence for the absence of mg - re or mg - sb site - disorder @xcite . as shown below </S>",
    "<S> , the c@xmath14 peaks at their phase transitions are very sharp , further underscoring the high degree of site order in the kagome layers . </S>",
    "<S> this good kagome layer separation is likely due to the large ion size difference between mg@xmath11 and re@xmath8 . in this structure , </S>",
    "<S> the nearest neighbor distance between the re@xmath8 ions within a kagome layer remains similar to that of its pyrochlore cousin , and the re@xmath8-kagome layers are well isolated from each other by the non - magnetic mg@xmath11 and sb@xmath15 layers . </S>",
    "<S> take mg@xmath0gd@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 for example , the nearest gd - gd distance within a kagome layer ( 3.678  ) is similar to that in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath18 ( 3.600  ) , and much smaller than that between different planes ( 6.162  ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the dipole - dipole energy goes as 1/@xmath22 , this leads to inter - layer energies an order of magnitude smaller than intra - layer energies . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the kagome lattice in mg@xmath0re@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 is seemingly free of structural defects .    in re@xmath0x@xmath0o@xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> one important structural feature is that each re@xmath8 ion is surrounded by eight oxygens ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ) with two shorter re - o1 bonds lying along the local-[111 ] axis and six longer re - o2 bonds forming a puckered ring . </S>",
    "<S> this feature defines the crystal electric field ( cef ) and the g - factor which determines the ionic anisotropy for the re@xmath8 spins . in mg@xmath0re@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 , this local oxygen coordination is largely preserved . </S>",
    "<S> the re ion is still surrounded by eight oxygens with the two shortest re - o1 bonds remain lying along the local-[111 ] axis ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference is that the longer six re - o bonds are divided into two sets : four longest re - o2 bonds and two intermediate re - o3 bonds @xcite . since the cef degeneracy has already been lifted by the pyrochlore - like anisotropy for an effective spin-1/2 system , the dominant anisotropy remains the one distinguishing the puckered ring from the local-[111 ] oxygens , making this in - plane anisotropy most likely irrelevant for the ground state degeneracy .    </S>",
    "<S> given the high degree of site order , the large difference in separation between intra - plane and inter - plane re ions , it is appropriate to consider this a well - formed kagome structure . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the cef - driven single - ion anisotropy , which is vestigial from the parent pyrochlore structure , defines directions for either the ising spins or the xy - spin normal vectors that are neither uniaxial nor uniplanar . </S>",
    "<S> this particular situation of three distinct axes with specific inter - axes angles will be important for understanding ordered spin configurations , as we show below . given the uniqueness of this structure and the need to distinguish it from klms with undefined local anisotropy , we call this the _  tripod kagome lattice ( tkl ) \" _ , inspired by a  tripod \" formed by three re@xmath8 and one mg@xmath11 ion ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> thus , we conclude mg@xmath0gd@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 to be a rare example of dipolar interaction mandated spin ordering on a kagome lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> the dy@xmath8 ion is an effective spin-1/2 kramers ion with ising anisotropy in an eight - oxygen - surrounding environment . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the spin ice system , the ising axis in dy - tkl variant is along the lines joining each dy to o1 ( dashed lines in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) ) . for the three sites in our bravais lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the ising directions are @xmath49 = @xmath50 , @xmath51 = @xmath52 , @xmath53 = @xmath54 in the global cartesian frame . </S>",
    "<S> the small @xmath24 of -0.18 k corresponds to @xmath45 @xmath21 1.12 k , while the dipolar energy scale @xmath44 @xmath21 1.31 k is the largest energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that ferromagnetic spins with tripod - like anisotropy on a kagome lattice are highly frustrated , which will lead to the ksi state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar to that of the pyrochlore spin ice @xcite , the ice rule ( spins with either two - in - one - out or one - in - two - out respect to the center of each triangular ) of ksi will also result in great number of ground state degeneracy and zero - point entropy @xcite .    with the tkl and strong dipolar interaction , it is tempting to view mg@xmath0dy@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 as a realization of a dipolar ferromagnet where the ksi physics could be realized . </S>",
    "<S> our luttinger - tisza method yields a metastable state at the bz center , which is an ordered ksi state . the corresponding spin structure ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(k ) ) can be viewed as a three - sublattices ferromagnetic order with @xmath10 = 0 . </S>",
    "<S> this spin structure also resembles the theoretically predicted lro state @xcite for the 3d pyrochlore spin ice observed in tb@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath7 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this @xmath10 = 0 state is not a global ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest eigenvalue of the exchange matrix is found to be at the six k points of bz corners , whose energy is somewhat lower than that of the zone center . </S>",
    "<S> such an eigenvalue corresponds to a lro state with a 3@xmath433 tripled magnetic unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the magnitude of the moment differs in space , as prescribed by a commensurate spin density wave ( sdw ) state . unlike the @xmath10 = 0 state where the ksi ice rule is preserved for every mg - dy tetrahedron ( grey triangular in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(k ) ) , here one out of six tetrahedrons violates the local ice rule . </S>",
    "<S> note that the luttinger - tisza method used here , is more akin to the mean field theory when applied away from the zone center or the m point of the bz . </S>",
    "<S> this is a nontrivial and complex problem ( see e.g. ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , and requires further theoretical investigation . </S>",
    "<S> regardless the exact nature of ordering , our tkl system then appears to enable the spin dynamics to be much more efficient , as compared to the 3d dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath7 compound . </S>",
    "<S> this interesting contrast therefore provides a strong impetus to the study of the underlying dynamics . along with the observed lro at 0.37 k , _ </S>",
    "<S> the dy - ising - tkl might provide a rare example exhibiting a lro state that breaks the ksi degeneracy_.    the er@xmath8 ion in mg@xmath0er@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 has a large angular momentum j = 15/2 . at low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> , it reduces to an effective spin-1/2 as a result of the kramers - doublet . </S>",
    "<S> the high temperature @xmath24 @xmath21 -14.52 k implies a large exchange energy @xmath45 @xmath21 11.0 k , while the dipolar energy scale is @xmath44 @xmath21 0.11 k by assuming a moment of 3 @xmath55 ( similar to that in the er pyrochlore ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that below @xmath21 10 k the spins are locked up into the state preferred by the exchange . </S>",
    "<S> the single ion anisotropy term in this case gives rise to a local - xy model , where the er@xmath8 are energetically favorable to lie in the local xy - plane perpendicular to the ising axis discussed above . in the er - pyrochlore , </S>",
    "<S> such a xy model , will give rise to a u(1 ) degeneracy in the spin hamiltonian at the mean - field level that allows the er@xmath8 spins to rotate continuously in the xy plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in er - tkl , similar xy degeneracy is preserved for the exchange part of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> however , an arbitrarily small long range dipolar interaction will break the degeneracy . by diagonalizing the interacting matrix , a lowest energy eigenvalue </S>",
    "<S> is found at the bz center whose eigenvector , by a curious coincidence , corresponds to the coplanar model exactly same as that of the gd compound ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(j ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> regarding the experimental observations for the er - tkl , since the 2.1 k anomaly in @xmath56 is extremely weak in terms of the entropy under the peak , and @xmath12 shows a similarly weak anomaly , the order parameter might be one that still allows significant fluctuations below its @xmath57 , reminiscent of a kt transition @xcite where spin - vortices form and bind . </S>",
    "<S> then the 80 mk transition shown on @xmath13 is likely related to the predicted 120@xmath3 coplanar afm ordering . </S>",
    "<S> if so , such a low ordering temperature ( frustration index @xmath58 = @xmath59 @xmath21 180 ) suggests the importance of quantum spin fluctuations in terms of suppressing the ordering temperature and selecting the ordered state . the weak frequency dependence on @xmath13 around the peak might indicate an increasing spin - lattice relaxation time as temperature </S>",
    "<S> is decreased . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of thermal coupling between a coherent spin system and the lattice needs to be understood for both identifying and potentially using quantum materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> future experiments including neutron scattering and muon spin spectroscopy will be useful to identify the nature of the two transitions at 80 mk and 2.1 k.    _ summary. _ we discovered a new 2d rare earth tkl mg@xmath0re@xmath1sb@xmath1o@xmath2 by partially substituting the ions in the cubic pyrochlore lattice . our studies on three samples with re = gd , dy , er have already related their magnetism to various exotic states including the dipolar spin order , the ksi , and the kt transition . due to the large variability of the spin sets in the rare earth family and the possibility of tuning the lattice parameters via chemical pressures , other exotic physics might also be realized . </S>",
    "<S> the future exploration of the whole tkl family members is expected to open a new field in condensed matter physics and materials science studies for coming years , such as the pyrochlore did during the last two decades .     </S>",
