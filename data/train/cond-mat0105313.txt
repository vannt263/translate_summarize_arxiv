    "there are many attempts to derive statistical mechanics from first principles .",
    "the earliest are by boltzmann  @xcite , gibbs  @xcite , and einstein  @xcite .",
    "the two central issues of statistical mechanics according to the deep and illuminating article by lebowitz  @xcite are to explain how irreversibility ( the second law of thermodynamics ) arises from fully reversible microscopic dynamics , and the other astonishing phenomenon of statistical mechanics : the occurence of phase transitions . in this paper",
    "i want to present an easy , straightforward derivation of both aspects directly out of the microscopic time - reversal invariant newton - mechanics invoking a minimum of assumptions .",
    "we will see how both problems are connected .",
    "there is an important aspect of statistical mechanics which to my opinion was not sufficiently considered up to now : statistical mechanics and also thermodynamics are _ macroscopic _ theories describing the _ average _   behavior of _ all _ @xmath2-body systems with the _ same macroscopic constraints_. it is this fact and nothing else that leads in a simple and straightforward manner to the desired understanding of irreversibility , the second law for @xmath2-body systems , which obey a completely time reversible hamiltonian dynamics , and leads simultaneously to the full spectrum of phase - transition phenomena .",
    "it is certainly essential to deduce the second law from reversible ( here newtonian ) and not from dissipative dynamics as is often done because just the _ derivation of irreversibility _ from fully _",
    "reversible _ dynamics is the main mystery of statistical mechanics . here a first hint : whereas a single trajectory in the ( finite-@xmath2)-body phase space returns after a _ finite _ poincar recurrence time a manifold of points develops in general irreversibly with time , see below .",
    "thermodynamics presents an economic but reduced description of a @xmath2-body system with a typical size of @xmath6 particles in terms of a very few ( @xmath7 ) `` macroscopic '' degrees of freedom ( @xmath8 s ) . here",
    "we will allow also for much smaller systems of some @xmath9 particles like nucleons in a nucleus .",
    "however , i assume that always @xmath10 .",
    "the believe that phase transitions and the second law can exist only in the thermodynamic limit will turn out to be false .    evidently , determining only @xmath11 @xmath8 s leaves the overwhelming number @xmath12 @xmath8 s undetermined . _ all _ n - body systems with the same macroscopic constraints are _ simultaneously _ described by thermodynamics .",

    "i will show how boltzmann s principle allows to define phase - transitions in `` small '' , non - extensive as well in normal `` large '' extensive systems where our more general definition of phase transitions ( see below ) will coincide with the conventional definition by the yang - lee singularities  @xcite .",
    "of course one should not wonder if some familiar features of conventional canonical thermo - statistics do not hold anymore in `` small '' systems .",
    "this is discussed in some more detail in subsection  [ equivalence ]",
    "during the dynamical evolution of a many - body system interacting by short range forces the internal energy is conserved",

    "i.e.  the fluctuations of the energy are @xmath32 if , however , the diameter of the system is of the order of the range of the force , i.e.  the system is `` small '' , non - extensive , details of the coupling to the container can not be ignored .",
    "in contrast , the canonical ensemble does not care about these details , assumes the system is homogeneous , averages over a boltzmann - gibbs ( exponential ) distribution @xmath33 of energy and fixes only the mean value of the energy by the temperature @xmath34 . in order to agree with the micro",
    ", @xmath35 must be sharp in @xmath19 i.e. self - averaging , what is usually not the case in non - extensive systems or at phase transitions of first order .",
    "then one _ must _ work in the micro , the only orthode ensemble .",
    "the micro - ensemble assumes precise  perhaps idealized  boundary conditions for each particle independently of whether the system is small or large .",
    "therefore , already gibbs considered the micro - ensemble as the fundamental and the canonical as approximation to it .",
    "he demonstrates clearly the failure of the canonical in cases of phase separation or other situations where both ensemble differ , footnote on page 75 of  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "there are important features where the microcanonical statistics of `` small '' systems deviates from the `` canonical '' structure of conventional thermo - statistics of extensive systems in the thermodynamical limit :    e.g. _ the familiar legendre - transform structure , a paradigm of `` canonical '' thermo - statistics , is lost_. clearly , without self - averaging , fixing an intensive parameter like the temperature @xmath36 does not fix the energy sharply .",
    "most evident example is a transition of first order in the canonical ensemble at the transition temperature where the energy per particle fluctuates by the specific latent heat even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "related is the occurrence of negative specific heat cf .",

    "the entropy is expressed by the mean - values of the extensive quantities like @xmath37  @xcite controlled by a lagrange parameter @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "of course , this is equivalent to the micro - ensemble ( is an orthode ) only if the variance of the energy is small . in one or the other way the thermodynamic limit , extensivity , and self - averaging is still demanded where legendre transformations ( may ) become one to one .",

    "the specification of a single point in @xmath142-dim phase - space and the reversion of all its @xmath244 momentum components demands of course a _ microscopic exact _ specification of all @xmath142 degrees of freedom not a determination of a few macroscopic degrees of freedom only .",
    "no entropy is defined for a single point .",
    "thermodynamics is addressed to the whole manifold , ensemble of systems with the same macroscopic constraints .",
    "the ensemble develops irreversibly even though the underlining newtonian dynamics of each phase - space point is fully reversible .",
    "it is highly unlikely that _ all _ points in the ensemble @xmath197 have commensurable recurrence times so that they can return _ simultaneously _ to their initial positions .",
    "_ once the manifold has spread over the larger phase space it will never return . _    also other misinterpretation of statistical mechanics are pointed out : the existence of phase transitions and critical phenomena are _ not _ linked to the thermodynamic limit .",

    "eventually `` small '' systems various non - trivial limiting processes are avoided .",
    "neither does one invoke the thermodynamic limit of a homogeneous system with infinitely many particles nor does one rely on the ergodic hypothesis of the equivalence of ( very long ) time averages and ensemble averages .",
    "as bricmont  @xcite remarked boltzmann s principle is the most conservative way to thermodynamics but more than that it is the most straight one also . _ the single axiomatic assumption of boltzmann s principle , which has a simple geometric interpretation , leads to the full spectrum of equilibrium thermodynamics including all kinds of phase transitions and including the second law of thermodynamics . _    in this paper , i take the fact serious that thermodynamics as well as any other _ macroscopic _ theory handles ensembles or sub - manyfolds and _ not _ single points in phase - space .",
    "_ thus the use of ensemble averages is justified directly by the very nature of macroscopic ( incomplete ) measurements_. entropy @xmath65 is the natural measure of the geometric size of the ensemble . with the boltzmann definition of @xmath65 statistical mechanics becomes a _",
    "geometric _ theory .",
    "the topology of its curvature indicates all phenomena of phase transitions independently of whether the system is `` small '' or large .",
    "coarse - graining appears as natural consequence of the ensemble - nature .",
    "the box - counting method mirrors the averaging over the overwhelming number of non - determined degrees of freedom .",
    "of course , a fully consistent theory must use this averaging explicitly . then one would not depend on the order of the limits @xmath245 as it was assumed here .",
    "presumably , the rise of the entropy can then already be seen at finite times when the fractality of the distribution in phase space is not yet fully developed .",
    "the coarse - graining is no more a mathematical ad hoc assumption .",
    "it is the necessary consequence of the averaging over the @xmath12 uncontrolled degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover the second law in the eps - formulation of statistical mechanics is not linked to the thermodynamic limit as was thought up to now  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "i did not contribute anything to the problem of describing irreversible thermodynamics of stationary dissipative systems as it is discussed e.g.  by gilbert and dorfman  @xcite , rondoni and cohen  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned already dissipation does not exist in the microscopic dynamics .",
    "it is not clear to me how far the inclusion of dissipation predefines the arrow of time already which should have been deduced from the theory .",
    "the main problem for me was the derivation of irreversibility from fully time reversible microscopic dynamics under maximally clear conditions , i.e. of a microcanonical closed system .",
    "gaspard  @xcite considers systems obeying a dynamics that preserves the phase - space volume , i.e satisfying liouville s theorem , but under non - equilibrium steady state conditions .",
    "similarly to the present approach he had to coarse grain ( width @xmath182 ) the accessible phase space . in conformity to the standard view of thermodynamics being based on the thermodynamic limit  @xcite",
    "he then proves the rise of the entropy _",
    "after the limits _ ( in that order ) @xmath246 . however , in this limit also the poincar recurrence time becomes infinite and zermelo s piercing argument becomes blunted .",
