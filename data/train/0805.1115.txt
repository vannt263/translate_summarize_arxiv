    "any supersymmetric standard models should have broken supersymmetry ( susy ) in order to be phenomenologically realistic .",
    "an intensively studied method of breaking the susy is the inclusion of soft breaking terms in the lagrangian density of the model [ 1 ] .",
    "phenomenological analyses of the supersymmetric standard model with soft breaking terms might become more realistic as well as more interesting if the soft breaking terms contain or induce some complex phases , since the presence of the complex phases may give rise to cp mixing in the higgs sector of the model [ 2 ] .",
    "the simplest version of the supersymmetric standard model is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which has just two higgs doublets in its higgs sector .",
    "the mssm at the tree level can not accommodate explicit nor spontaneous cp violation , because any complex phases in the higgs sector of the mssm can always be eliminated by rotating the higgs fields . even at the one - loop level",
    ", spontaneous cp violation is disfavored by the mssm because a very light neutral higgs boson is required , which has already been ruled out by experiments [ 3 ] . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that explicit cp violation is viable in the mssm at the one - loop level , since the radiative corrections due to quarks and squarks yield the cp mixings between the neutral higgs bosons [ 4 - 7 ] .",
    "a number of nonminimal versions of the supersymmetric standard model have been introduced in the literature , by including a higgs singlet to the higgs sector of the mssm [ 8 ] , such as the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) with @xmath0 symmetry [ 9 - 16 ] , the general nmssm with broken @xmath0 [ 17 ] , the minimal non - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mnmssm ) with tadpole terms [ 18 ] , and the minimal supersymmetric models with an additional @xmath1 [ 19,20 ] , to cite a few of them .",
    "an advantage of them over the mssm is that the vacuum expectation value of the higgs singlet may dynamically solve the problem of dimensional @xmath2-parameter in the mssm [ 21 ] .",
    "the nmssm , which is most popular among those nonminimal versions of the supersymmetric model , has been extensively studied in various aspects of phenomenology , including explicit cp violation [ 13 - 16 ] . in the nmssm",
    ", explicit cp violation may take place at the tree level , since the nmssm may have one nontrivial cp phase after redefining the higgs fields . by assuming the degeneracy of the stop quark masses in the higgs sector of the nmssm",
    ", it is found that large explicit cp violation may be realized as the vacuum expectation value of the neutral higgs singlet in the nmssm approaches to the electroweak scale [ 13 ] .",
    "we have elsewhere studied the effects of explicit cp violation in the nmssm on the neutral and charged higgs boson masses at the one - loop level by considering radiative corrections due to various particles and their superpartners [ 15 ] .",
    "also , we have recently calculated the higgs decays within the context of the nmssm with explicit cp violation [ 16 ] .",
    "the mnmssm is different from the nmssm in the sense that explicit cp violation is not possible at the tree level in the mnmssm .",
    "this is because the higgs sector of the mnmssm , unlike the nmssm , can always absorb the cp - violating complex phase by rotating the relevant higgs fields such that its tree - level higgs potential can not have any cp phase .",
    "thus , within the context of explicit cp violation in the higgs sector , the mnmssm is similar to the mssm with an additional @xmath1 rather than the nmssm . at the tree level",
    ", the mssm with an additional @xmath1 can always eliminate any complex cp phase in its higgs sector by employing the tadpole minimum condition or by rotating the three neutral higgs fields [ 20 ] .",
    "the cp symmetry of the mnmssm may be violated at the one - loop level in an explicit way as radiative corrections are taken into account .    in this article",
    ", we study the explicit cp violation scenario at the one - loop level in the higgs sector of the mnmssm . we calculate the radiatively corrected masses of the neutral higgs bosons in the mnmssm .",
    "the dominant decay modes for the neutral higgs bosons into heavy fermion pairs , gluon pairs , and weak boson pairs , are studied .",
    "we are interested in the dependency of those decays on the cp phases in the explicit cp violation scenario at the one - loop level .",
    "the branching ratios for the neutral higgs bosons with cp - undefined states are found to vary significantly against the cp phases , arising from the squark masses of the third generation .",
    "the higgs sector of the mnmssm consists of two higgs doublet superfields @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and a higgs singlet superfield @xmath5 . keeping only the yukawa couplings for the third generation of quarks , the superpotential of mnmssm may be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is totally antisymmetric with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the su(2 ) doublet quark and lepton superfields of the third generation , respectively , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the su(2 ) singlet top , bottom , and tau superfields respectively , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the yukawa coupling coefficients of top , bottom , and tau superfields , respectively , and @xmath17 is a dimensionless coupling coefficient .",
    "the tree - level higgs potential , @xmath18 , of the mnmssm may be decomposed into @xmath19-terms , @xmath20-terms , the soft terms , and the tadpole terms as @xmath21 where @xmath22 \\ , \\cr v_{\\rm s } & = & m_{h_1}^2|h_1|^2 + m_{h_2}^2|h_2|^2 + m_n^2|n|^2 - ( \\lambda a_{\\lambda } \\varepsilon_{ij } h_1^i h_2^j n + { \\rm h.c . } ) \\ ,",

    "note that the above tree - level higgs potential would additionally have a global @xmath1 peccei - quinn symmetry if there is no tadpole term .",
    "the global @xmath1 peccei - quinn symmetry gives a natural solution to the strong cp problem [ 22 ] .",
    "however , it leads to the existence of a massless pseudo - goldstone boson which emerges from the tree - level higgs potential since the determinant of the pseudoscalar higgs boson mass matrix is zero [ 23 ] .",
    "this is the weinberg - wilczek axion .",
    "the global @xmath1 peccei - quinn symmetry is eventually broken by the quantum effects arising from the triangle anomaly , since the noether current for the global @xmath1 transformation is anomalous , and the weinberg - wilczek axion acquires a small mass due to instanton effects .",
    "its mass is inversely proportional to the scale of the axion decay constant @xmath32 as @xmath33 where @xmath32 is assumed to be the electroweak scale . by considering the weinberg - wilczek axion as the candidate for the cold dark matter ,",
    "cosmology estimates @xmath34 [ 24 ] .",
    "this information predicts that the scale of the axion decay constant is bounded as @xmath35 gev .",
    "the weinberg - wilczek axion has been excluded by the negative results of experimental searches . on the other hand , in such models as the kim - shifman - vainshtein - zakharov model",
    "[ 25 ] or the dine - fischler - srednicki - zhitnitskii model [ 26 ] , the scale of the axion decay constant can be very high and thus the axion in these models becomes practically invisible .",
    "therefore , it may survive without contradicting the experimental constraints .    in order to avoid the weinberg - wilczek axion in the mnmssm",
    ", we introduce the tadpole term in the higgs potential , as seen in eq.(2 ) , thus , the global @xmath1 peccei - quinn symmetry in the mnmssm is explicitly broken .",
    "the tadpole coefficient @xmath31 in the tadpole term is intrinsically a free parameter .",
    "however , it might be assumed that it is the same order of the susy breaking scale from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "we would like to show that the higgs sector of the mnmssm can not invoke explicit cp violation at the tree level .",
    "note that , if the above tree - level higgs potential contain any complex phases , the possibility would be that @xmath27 , @xmath17 , or @xmath31 are complex . among them , without loss of generality , @xmath27 may be assumed to be real , since its phase can always be absorbed into the phase of @xmath17 .",
    "further , @xmath17 can be made real by adjusting the phases of the higgs doublets , while @xmath31 can also be made real by adjusting the phase of the higgs singlet .",
    "consequently , the higgs potential of the mnmssm at the tree level can only have real parameters , hence no explicit cp violation .",
    "it is also impossible for the higgs sector of the mnmssm at the tree level to invoke spontaneous cp violation .    in terms of the physical higgs fields , the higgs doublets and the higgs singlet",
    "may generally be expressed as @xmath36 where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) are the neutral scalar higgs fields , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) are the neutral pseudoscalar higgs fields , @xmath41 is the charged higgs field , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are respectively the vacuum expectation values of the neutral higgs fields with @xmath45 = 174 gev and @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the relative phase between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the phase of @xmath51 .",
    "now , the tree - level tadpole minimum conditions upon the tree - level higgs potential of the mnmssm , which are derived from the first derivatives of the tree - level higgs potential with respect to the two pseudoscalar higgs fields , may be written as @xmath52 where the two phases @xmath53 and @xmath54 are defined as @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "it is straightforward that the tadpole minimum conditions are satisfied only when both @xmath53 and @xmath54 are zero , in other words , only if @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , explicit cp violation is not possible in the higgs sector of the mnmssm at the tree level .    in order to accommodate any complex phases",
    "so as to induce the cp violation between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons in the present model , one has to consider higher - order corrections .",
    "the radiative corrections due to top and stop quarks are known to affect significantly the tree - level higgs sector of supersymmetric models .",

    "after the spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak symmetry , the quark masses of the third generation are given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and the squark masses of the third generation are given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the soft susy breaking mass , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the trilinear susy breaking parameters with mass dimension , and two phases @xmath73 and @xmath74 are given as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are respectively the phases of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which are in general assumed to be complex . in the expressions for the squark masses , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are now real parameters because their phases are already taken out .",

    "unlike the tree - level case , @xmath53 at the one - loop level is not zero but dependent on the other parameters .",
    "let us rename @xmath53 at the one - loop level as @xmath82 hereafter , in order to avoid any confusion with the tree - level @xmath53 that is zero . on the other hand , one can easily see that @xmath83 satisfies the second tadpole minimum condition , by substituting the first tadpole minimum condition into the second one . in other words",
    ", we have @xmath84 and @xmath85 , renamed as @xmath82 , which is expressed in terms of the other parameters .",
    "thus , we are left with @xmath73 and @xmath74 at the one - loop level .",
    "consequently , the higgs sector of the mnmssm may eventually have two physical cp phase @xmath73 and @xmath74 at the one - loop level even if there is no complex phase at the tree level",

    "therefore , the magnitude of the cp mixing between scalar and pseudoscalar neutral higgs bosons is directly dependent on @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the cp mixing would be maximal when @xmath127 .",

    "in the standard model ( sm ) , it is well known that particles acquire their masses through the interactions with the higgs field .",
    "this implies the existence of the yet - undiscovered sm higgs boson .",

    "its mass being larger than 2@xmath134 , the sm higgs boson would decay mainly into pairs of weak gauge bosons or top quarks .    from the extrapolations of the relevant couplings through the higgs decay modes in our model , the experimental constraint on the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson in our model might be derived .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the higgs decay modes is essential for the higgs searches .",
    "the total decay width of the @xmath137th neutral higgs boson in our model may be assumed as [ 30 ] @xmath138 where the notations for each particle can be understood without difficulty .",
    "note that the higgs bosons might decay into a supersymmetric particle pair if their masses are small enough . for a comprehensive analysis",
    ", the higgs decays into sfermions , neutralinos , and chargions also must be considered in explicit cp violation scenario on the present model .",
    "the higgs decays into a superparticle pair do not play an important role for relatively light higgs bosons [ 30 ] .",
    "also , it has been noted that the decay modes into supersymmetric particles acquire significant branching ratios and can be dominant ones if they are possible [ 30 ] . in our case , we set the parameter values such that a common susy breaking scale is taken to be 1 tev .",
    "thus , the squark masses are relatively heavy in our case , and therefore we speculate that the higgs decays into a squark pair would contribute weakly to the total higgs decay .",
    "we note that our speculation is based on the size of the coupling coefficients between higgs bosons and a pair of squarks , which we explicitly derive . using them , we calculate the partial decay width of a higgs boson into a pair of gluons via squarks .",

    "1 , where contours of @xmath185 is plotted on the ( @xmath190)-plane . please notice that @xmath185 increases as the tadpole coefficient @xmath31 increases , because the tadpole term prohibits a massless neutral higgs boson .",

    ", the mass of the neutral higgs boson may be released from the lep2 constraint .",
    "for example , the mssm in the explicit cp violation scenario with @xmath192 allows the existence of a neutral higgs boson with a mass as small as 30 gev [ 31 ] .",
    "this implies that discovering a neutral higgs boson depends not only on its mass but also its coupling coefficients and other factors .",

    "it is noticeable that @xmath205 is comparable to @xmath206 for @xmath207 .",
    "the fluctuations of the branching ratios of @xmath204 against the cp phase are also recognizable in fig .",
    "3e . for @xmath204 decay , @xmath208 and @xmath209 remains almost stable , whereas @xmath210 and @xmath211 decrease by an order of magnitude , as @xmath73 varies from zero to @xmath198 .",
    "the patterns of the branching ratios of @xmath131 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath214 , are nearly similar to each other .",
    "the next dominant decay channel is @xmath215 for @xmath65 = 1 - 4 .",
    "the branching ratios do not wildly fluctuate against the cp phase , and the relative size between the branching ratios are @xmath216 , for @xmath65 = 1 - 4 .",
    "we would like to remark the interesting behavior of @xmath214 at the branching ratio for the gluon channel @xmath217 . as shown in fig .",
    "3d , we have @xmath218 for @xmath219 .",
    "we note that the most part of this value comes from the scalar gluon amplitude @xmath151 rather than the pseudoscalar gluon amplitude @xmath152 for @xmath220 .",
    "this is because the top and bottom quark contributions cancel out accidently each other in the pseudoscalar amplitude @xmath152 for @xmath214 in eq .",
    "( 20 ) , that is , @xmath221 and @xmath222 in @xmath152 have accidentally almost the same value but with opposite sign , for @xmath220 .",
    "thus , the scalar gluon amplitude contributes dominantly to the @xmath217 in our analysis .    finally , we calculate @xmath223 , the total decay widths of @xmath129 ( @xmath65 = 1 - 5 ) , for the same parameter values as in fig .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "4 , where @xmath224 ( @xmath65 = 1 - 5 ) are plotted as functions of @xmath197 . their dependence on the cp phase is quite large . while @xmath225 and @xmath226 decrease as @xmath73 increases , the total decay widths of the other neutral higgs bosons increase with increasing @xmath73 . in particular , it is worthwhile noticing the increase of @xmath227 .",
    "this behavior is understandable because the decay channel into a pair of weak gauge bosons is only allowed for @xmath204 .",
    "we study the higgs sector of the mnmssm with tadpole terms .",
    "we see that the model can accommodate explicit cp violation at the one - loop level .",
    "as the squarks of the third generation with non - degenerate masses give rise to the radiative corrections , the explicit cp violation can be generated by complex phases @xmath73 and @xmath74 which appear in their mass matrices . at the tree level",
    ", neither explicit nor spontaneous cp violation would be viable in the higgs sector of the model . unlike our model , the nmssm may possess complex phases at the tree level .    in the presence of the complex phases that trigger the explicit cp violation at the one - loop level , we calculate the masses , the branching ratios for dominant decay channels , and the decay widths of the five neutral higgs bosons in our model .",
    "the masses show fluctuations up to 60 % as the cp phase varies , for given parameter values . whereas the heaviest neutral higgs boson in our model can be as heavy as 160 gev",
    ", the rest of them is relatively light .",
    "in particular , the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson in our model is predicted to be as small as 12 gev , for reasonable ranges of relevant parameter values .",
    "although the predicted mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson is well below experimental constraint of lep2 , it might have been escaped from experiments since its discovery depends on its coupling coefficients to other particles as well as on its mass .",
    "the coupling coefficients of the neutral higgs bosons to fermion pairs , weak gauge boson pairs , gluon pairs , and squark pairs have been explicitly calculated .",
    "the results of calculation , which have not been derived before , may be used helpfully for the search of higgs boson in similar supersymmetric models in the future experiments . in terms of these coupling coefficients ,",
    "the branching ratios of the five neutral higgs bosons for dominant decay channels are calculated , where the cp violation effect is included .",
    "we find that the heaviest neutral higgs boson exhibits fluctuating branching ratios against the variation of the cp phase .",
    "for the rest four higgs bosons , the decay into a pair of bottom quarks is most dominant , and the branching ratios are rather stable against the variation of the cp phase .",
    "finally , we calculate the total decay widths of the five neutral higgs bosons , which are significantly dependent on the cp phase .",
    "if cp is violated at the one - loop level in the mnmssm with tadpole terms , the result of our calculations , which has been done for a representative set or range of parameter values , suggests that the whole parameter space should be investigated in order to draw more interesting observations within the context of cp violation .",
