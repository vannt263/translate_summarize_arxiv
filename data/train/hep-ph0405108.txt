    "the study of @xmath1 physics and the associated cp violating observables has been suggested as a good means to extract information on new physics at low energy scales . since @xmath1-@xmath6 mixing is a loop - mediated process within the standard model ( sm )",
    ", it offers an opportunity to see the footprints of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the currently observed @xmath7 ps@xmath8 @xcite and its mixing phase @xmath9 extracted from the @xmath10 mode @xcite agree well with constraints obtained from other experiments @xcite .",

    ", @xmath12 is expected to be about @xmath13 ps@xmath8 and its mixing phase @xmath14 only a couple of degrees .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath15 system , the more than 25 times larger oscillation frequency and a factor of four lower hadronization rate from @xmath16 quarks pose the primary challenges in the study of @xmath3 oscillation and @xmath5 asymmetries .",
    "since the @xmath17 decay is dominated by a cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) favored tree - level process , @xmath18 , that does not involve a different weak phase in the sm , its asymmetry provides the most reliable information about the mixing phase @xmath14 .",
    "although new physics contributions may not compete with the sm processes in most of the @xmath18 decays , they can play an important role in @xmath3-@xmath19 mixing because of its loop nature in the sm @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the mixing can be significantly modified in models in which a tree - level @xmath20 transition is present .",
    "thus , measurement of the properties of @xmath3 meson mixing is of high interest in future @xmath1 physics studies as a means to reveal new physics @xcite .",
    "since the current @xmath1 factories do not run at the @xmath21 resonance to produce @xmath3 mesons , it is one of the primary objectives of hadronic colliders to study @xmath3 oscillation and decay in the coming years @xcite .",
    "flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) coupled to an extra @xmath0 gauge boson arise when the @xmath4 couplings to physical fermion eigenstates are non - diagonal .",
    "one way for this to happen is by the introduction of exotic fermions with different @xmath0 charges that mix with the sm fermions @xcite as occurs in @xmath22 models . in the @xmath22 case ,",
    "mixing of the right - handed ordinary and exotic quarks , all @xmath23 singlets , induces fcnc mediated by a heavy @xmath4 or by ( small ) @xmath24-@xmath4 mixing , so the quark mixing can be large . mixing between ordinary ( doublet ) and exotic ( singlet ) left - handed quarks",

    "off - diagonal couplings of fermions to the @xmath4 boson can be obtained without mixing with additional fermion states . in these types of models ,",
    "both left - handed and right - handed fermions can have family non - diagonal couplings with the @xmath4 , while couplings to the @xmath24 are family diagonal ( up to small effects from @xmath25 mixing ) .",
    "the @xmath4 contributions to @xmath3-@xmath19 mixing are related to those for hadronic , semileptonic , and leptonic @xmath1 decays in specific models in which the diagonal @xmath4 couplings to @xmath26 , @xmath27 , etc .",
