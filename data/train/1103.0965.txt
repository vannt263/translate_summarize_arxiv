    "recently , interest in the electronic properties of surfaces and interfaces of strongly correlated electron systems has grown due to the discovery of conducting interfaces , with a substantial high carrier mobility , between two insulating perovskites.@xcite theoretical studies of these systems@xcite concluded that the leakage of charge from one layer to the other explains the results .",
    "thus , charge transfer between materials in heterostructures can be used to stabilize interface states that otherwise would be obtained only via the chemical doping of the parent oxide compound . on the other hand ,",
    "comparing results from measurements with different surface - sensitive photoemission , it has been shown that the spectral function can be strongly modified at the surface , compared with the bulk.@xcite for example , it was shown that the weight of the coherent part of the spectral function is reduced at the surface.@xcite    interfaces obviously break translational invariance , and where present , the rotational symmetry of the bulk . beyond this significant alteration in symmetry ,",
    "there are important quantitative changes , such as a reduction of dispersion and changes of the crystal fields .",
    "stress or strain is induced by the interface , which alters the distances and bonds between the ions .",
    "the lattice may even be structurally or electronically reconstructed . due to these and other phenomena",
    ", the interface shifts and distorts the electronic states and energy levels at the ions , and modifies the entire electronic band . since the electronic states of the individual ions and the screening are altered at interfaces , their correlations are strongly modified as well.@xcite these phenomena raise an important question : how does the surface / interface electronic phase differ from the bulk ?    theoretical research on the effects of a surface or interface on strongly correlated electrons in inhomogeneous systems was initiated in large part by potthoff and nolting,@xcite who studied the hubbard model using an extension of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite appropriate to a layered system with a surface .",
    "studies of solid - vacuum interfaces have unveiled the possibility of surface ferromagnetism,@xcite and explored the penetration depth of a bulk metallic phase into an otherwise insulating surface.@xcite borghi _",
    "have indeed shown the existence of a dead layer , due to an exponential penetration of metallic excitations.@xcite yunoki _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite have studied the possibility of magnetic ordering and superconductivity at the interface between undoped high-@xmath0 cuprates and manganites .",
    "et al . _ have studied the effect of interplanar coulomb correlations on the electronic structure of strongly correlated heterostructures by applying the cluster dmft method.@xcite studies of solid - vacuum interfaces of the holstein - like models in an inhomogeneous system have shown that the polaron crossover takes place first on the surface .",
    "most of this previous work has been done for the half - filled hubbard model with particle - hole symmetry .",
    "however , at interfaces there is not only a change of the energy spectrum and of the correlation , but due to charge transfer , the state occupancy also varies . in the present work ,",
    "we focus on charge transfer phenomena in the framework of a hubbard - like model hamitonian .",
    "especially , we are interested in a doping - driven mott transition in the presence of a surface .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model hamiltonian , which is a semi - infinite hubbard model with layer dependent parameters .",
    "the corresponding results are presented and analyzed in section iii .",
    "finally , section iv is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "the simplest model hamiltonian exhibiting mott physics@xcite is the hubbard model,@xcite in which the local repulsion correlates the electronic motion . at half - filling ,",
    "this model captures many properties of the pressure - driven mott transition .",
    "the hubbard model away from half - filling can be used to investigate the density - driven mott transition . here",
    "we try to model some part of the phenomena occurring at the interfaces of the strongly correlated electron systems using the hubbard model with non - uniform model parameters .",
    "the system is a three - dimensional , bipartite simple - cubic ( sc ) lattice with nearest - neighbor hopping only .",
    "the lattice is cut along a plane perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes , e.g. the z - axis [ sc(001 ) surface ] .",
    "the system is considered to be built up by two - dimensional layers parallel to the surface .",
    "accordingly , the position vector to a particular site in the semi - infinite lattice is written as @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 stands for the coordinate origin in the layer @xmath3 , and the layer index runs from @xmath4 for the topmost surface layer to infinity .",
    "the variable @xmath5 is the position vector with respect to a layer - dependent origin , and runs over the sites within the layer .",
    "each lattice site is then labeled by indices @xmath6 and @xmath3 . in this notation ,",
    "the hamiltonian reads : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the destruction ( creation ) operator for electrons with spin @xmath9 on site @xmath6 of the @xmath3 layer .",
    "the electron density on site @xmath10 is denoted @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the hopping matrix element between two nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "@xmath13 is the layer - dependent electron - electron on - site interaction .",
    "we use a uniform @xmath14 and fix the energy scale by setting @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "the intralayer hopping @xmath17 or the hopping between the surface and the subsurface layer @xmath18 can be modified ( @xmath19 ) to simulate different correlation strengths and/or relaxation processes at the surface .",
    "our calculations are based on the embedding approach@xcite for dynamical mean field theory for a simple cubic lattice .",
    "this method is based on partitioning of the layered structure into a surface region which includes the first @xmath20 layers and an adjacent semi - infinite bulk region ( substrate ) to which it is coupled .",
    "then the effect of the substrate on the surface region is described by an energy - dependent embedding potential . in constructing the embedding potential the self - energy of a bulk crystal corresponding to the substrate",
    "is required ; this is obtained through a standard dmft calculation . after constructing the embedding potential the self energy matrix of the surface region",
    "is determined using a layered dmft calculation . in the framework of single - site dmft ,",
    "the self - energy matrix of the surface region is local [ i.e. , @xmath21 and independent of wave vector . using the converged self - energy matrix we can find quasiparticle weights and local occupancies .    in this study ,",
    "the number of surface layers is chosen to be @xmath22 and we tested that this number provides converged results .",
    "our impurity solver is exact diagonalization,@xcite where the bath is represented in terms of a finite number of levels , @xmath23 .",
    "the typical value we considered for the bath level is @xmath24 and we tested that this number provides essentially converged results .",
    "all errors associated with the use of these numbers are smaller than the points on the graphs .",
    "for a bulk lattice , in a phase with translational invariance , local occupations are site independent , @xmath25 . on the contrary , for a semi - infinite lattice , the different local environment of the surface sites causes the local occupations near the surface to differ from the bulk filling . charge transfer is present in the free - electron system@xcite and we discuss the facts already known for this case first . the reduced coordination number and probably different hopping elements connecting at least one site in the surface layer of the semi - infinite system leads to a narrowing of the surface local density of states ( ldos ) , @xmath26 , relative to the bulk , @xmath27 ( spectral weight is reduced at low and high energies but enhanced at intermediate energies ) .",
    "however , the surface ldos and the bulk ldos have the same band edges and their overall width is given by the free bulk dos.@xcite the band narrowing can be understood by referring to the moments of the ldos , @xmath28 for a site in the bulk , the width of the dos is given by @xmath29 , while for a site on the surface the result is @xmath30.@xcite clearly , if these hopping matrix elements are equal to those in the bulk , then this width is narrower at the surface than at the bulk . from this fact",
    ", it follows that in order to ensure thermodynamic equilibrium , i.e. , a common chemical potential @xmath31 , one has @xmath32 below and @xmath33 above half - filling , since the surface electron density @xmath34 is lesser ( greater ) for below ( above ) half filling than the bulk density , @xmath35 .",
    "thus the surface layer will have charge depletion ( accumulation ) below ( above ) half filling.@xcite    these effects are all due to a reduced coordination number and probably different hopping elements .",
    "in addition a strong electron - electron interaction can cause a quite complicated charge redistribution at the surface . in the following , we present results on charge transfer and its effects on spectral weight for a semi - infinite hubbard model with uniform- and non - uniform hopping elements .",
    "we start our discussion with the case of uniform parameters .",
    "[ fig : chargetransferuniform ] shows the charge transfer @xmath36 between the surface layer ( @xmath4 ) and the bulk as a function of the filling @xmath37 at @xmath38 .",
    "the three curves are for ( a ) @xmath39 as just discussed , ( b ) @xmath40 , a value chosen to be below the critical mott transition value @xmath41,@xcite and ( c ) @xmath42 , a value chosen to be above the critical mott transition value @xmath43 .",
    "as argued above , the case without interactions displays surface charge depletion for all electron densities below half filling ( and exactly the opposite for above half filling ) . for cases where there are interactions between the electrons , the situation is clearest in the strong coupling limit , where , at least at half filling , there are two well separated hubbard bands .",
    "insofar as doping into the @xmath44 regime involves only the lower hubbard band ( definitely an oversimplification ) then we should see an electron density dependence over this entire electron density regime ( @xmath45 ) similar to what is observed in the case without interactions , but over the entire density range ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this is borne out by the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : chargetransferuniform ] for non - zero interaction strength : a surface electron density depletion is observed for small to intermediate densities , and an accumulation for densities from beyond quarter filling to near half filling is seen . apparently for an interacting system the key effect of a narrowing of the surface local density of states holds quite generally , even in the presence of interactions , and even within the lower and upper hubbard bands .    upon increasing the bulk charge density , the chemical potential moves from the lower half of the lower quasiparticle sub - band to the upper half of that same sub - band .",
    "in addition , the differences between the @xmath47 and the bulk @xmath37 diminish with increasing distance from the surface and for the third layer , the occupation is almost indistinguishable from the bulk occupation ( not shown ) . finally , note that the charge transfer in the noninteracting limit is larger than in the interacting cases , so the expectation that increased interactions tend to reduce overall the magnitude of charge transfer is supported by these results .",
    "indeed , a finite charge transfer implies an ( unfavorable ) increase of the average double occupancy compared with the homogeneous charge distribution ; thus , a non - zero hubbard interaction between conduction electrons will tend to suppress charge transfer .",
    "however , due to separation of low- and high - energy states , charge transfer is not completely suppressed in the strong coupling limit , @xmath48 , even when the long range coulomb interaction is present .    also as expected , at half - filling",
    "there is no charge transfer at all , because particle - hole symmetry on a bipartite lattice with nearest - neighbor hopping requires a homogeneous charge distribution among the layers.@xcite    theoretical studies of the hubbard model for bulk systems , mainly using dmft,@xcite have shown that in a bulk system at half - filling , the system is insulating for a sufficiently large coulomb repulsion , @xmath49 .",
    "for any other filling , the ground state is metallic . in the metal the charge compressibility @xmath50",
    "remains finite even when the insulator is approached from above or below half - filling , but the chemical potential changes discontinuously from @xmath51 to @xmath52 as the filling goes from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath55 , the system is insulating and half - filled . doping away from",
    "half - filling induces states inside the mott - hubbard gap.@xcite therefore the jump in chemical potential @xmath56 for infinitesimal doping is strictly less than the single - particle gap of the insulator .",
    "another feature of the dmft treatment of the mott transition is that both the interaction - driven transition at half - filling@xcite and the density - driven transition@xcite are characterized by the coexistence of two solutions in some parameter regimes . in the latter case ,",
    "there is a region of chemical potentials , delimited by two curves @xmath57 and @xmath58 for hole doping , in which a metallic solution with @xmath59 and an insulating one with @xmath60 coexist . naturally , the stable solution is the one that minimizes the grand - canonical free energy . at @xmath38",
    "the metal is stable in the whole coexistence region and is continuously connected to the insulator . at finite temperature",
    "the energetic balance is more complicated , and a first - order transition occurs along an intermediate line between @xmath61 and @xmath62 , leading to phase separation between the two phases ( formation of a phase mixture with a fraction @xmath63 of the metal and @xmath64 of the insulator ) .",
    "is it possible to drive a mott transition on the surface at a critical chemical potential different from that required for the bulk ? to address this question , we focus on the behaviour of the electron density @xmath37 as a function of the chemical potential @xmath31 and on the density - driven mott transition . a plot of the occupation as a function of the chemical potential , shown in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : densityuniform ] for two different values of @xmath14 , clearly shows the mott transition into an incompressible state , as a plateau near @xmath65 , when the hubbard @xmath14 is greater than the critical coupling @xmath43 .",
    "when @xmath14 is lower than the critical value ( upper left panel ) then , while the filling still approaches unity at @xmath65 , there is clearly no plateau present .",
    "as can be seen in the lower left panel , for chemical potential near the critical value ( where @xmath37 becomes unity ) , the surface layer approaches an insulating state slightly faster than the bulk .",
    "nonetheless , the electron density eventually approaches unity at the _ same _ chemical potential that governs the bulk density .",
    "the net result is that the surface tracks the bulk as far as the metal - insulator transition is concerned , and a metal in the bulk implies a metal at the surface .    to examine this transition in more detail , the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : densityuniform ] show the quasiparticle weight for the @xmath66 layer , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 is the self - energy for layer @xmath3 ) as a function of occupation for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this figure shows the existence of a so called dead layer at the surface characterized by an exponentially decaying quasi - particle weight near half - filling ( lower panel ) . in the upper panel ,",
    "the quasiparticle weight in the bulk does not reach zero , indicating that the @xmath14 is below the critical value .",
    "smaller @xmath71 at the surface at small doping means the coherent peak near the fermi energy is narrower at the surface and the incoherent hubbard band is more pronounced than in the bulk , in agreement with experiment.@xcite such a trend has been reported in studies of the correlation - driven metal - insulator phase transition at half - filling.@xcite however , the reduction of the surface quasiparticle weight seen here is much weaker than in the experiments .    at low electron density",
    "the quasiparticle weight for the surface layer is greater than for the bulk ( not shown ) . in this region",
    "the depletion of charge from the surface to the bulk ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : chargetransferuniform ] ) causes a reduction of correlation effects , which leads to a more robust quasiparticle at the surface .    to illustrate to",
    "what extent charge transfer is responsible for the differences at the surface vs. the bulk , we try to eliminate the effect of enhanced correlation at the surface . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : quasiparticleuniform ] we show the bulk and surface quasi particle weights for @xmath70 as a function of electron density very close to half - filling .",
    "this figure also include several bulk calculations for larger values of @xmath14 .",
    "if the enhanced correlation effect is responsible for the differences at the surface , we should recover the original value of the surface @xmath71 in a bulk calculation with a larger value of @xmath14 . as is seen from the figure , even for a very large value of @xmath14 , the bulk calculation is unable to reproduce the original surface result .",
    "therefore charge transfer effects play an important role in a doped mott insulator . as another test for this statement , in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : quasiparticleuniform ] we use @xmath72 in the bulk , and then show several semi - infinite calculations with reduced surface correlation @xmath73 .",
    "this figure also shows that upon reducing the value of @xmath73 it is not possible to have the same quasiparticle weights at the surface as in the bulk calculation .",
    "thus , the charge transfer effect is more important than enhanced correlation effects in a doped mott insulator .",
    "this is expected because the interaction strength is already large enough to give a mott insulator at half - filling , so enhancing that value would not lead to any significant change .",
    "indeed , the occupation distance from half - filling is more important here .",
    "this quantity tunes with the charge transfer effect .      in the previous section , we mentioned that the reduction of the quasiparticle weight at the surface is smaller when compared to the reduction found in experiments . here",
    "we show that a modified hopping at the surface causes a larger charge transfer and then the reduction in surface quasiparticle weight is greatly amplified . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chargetransfernonuniform ] we show the charge transfer for the case where the hopping from a site on the surface to one on the layer beneath is lower , @xmath74 , and the case where the intralayer hopping on the surface layer is reduced with respect to that in the bulk , @xmath75 .",
    "these figures show that reduced hopping matrix elements on the surface sites enhance the amount of charge transfer . in the case of @xmath75 ,",
    "the value of charge transfer is sufficiently large that including the long - range coulomb interaction will have some effect in reducing the total amount . for simplicity",
    ", however , we exclude this point here ; we believe that including the long - range coulomb interaction will lessen some of the effects described below , but the basic results will still hold .",
    "[ fig : densitynonuniform ] shows the electron density as a function of the chemical potential ( left panels ) and quasiparticle weights as a function of electron density ( right panels ) for reduced hopping parameters near the surface . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : densitynonuniform ] the tendency toward an insulating state is certainly enhanced as we lower the hopping parameters near the surface .",
    "for reduced parameters , particularly for reduced @xmath76 , the plateau region is considerably extended ( left panels ) .",
    "close examination , however , verifies that even in the case of non - uniform parameters , there is only one transition for the entire sample .",
    "also , results for quasiparticle weights ( right panels ) show that the reduction in @xmath71 is considerably more pronounced in the case of reduced parameters and is almost negligible for a wider range of doping . it is a matter for experiment to decide if such changes in surface parameters can explain the data in a consistent manner .    to further illustrate to what extent charge transfer is responsible for the differences at the surface vs. the bulk , even in cases where the surface parameters can vary from those in the bulk , we reshow in fig .  [ fig : quasiparticle2 ] the results for @xmath71 for @xmath42 and @xmath77 for both the bulk ( open squares joined by solid ( black ) lines ) and the surface ( filled red squares joined by dashed ( red ) lines ) .",
    "there are clear and significant differences , particularly at low ( @xmath78 ) and high ( @xmath79 ) electron concentration ; however , to account for charge transfer effects we use the information in fig .",
    "[ fig : chargetransfernonuniform ] and show the surface quasiparticle weight on the same plot as a function of @xmath80 ; this is shown by open circles joined by ( green ) short - dashed lines .",
    "the trend as a function of electron concentration now is qualitatively similar to that of the bulk .",
    "however , one can improve upon this even further , since , in reality the electrons on the surface experience a stronger relative coulomb repulsion due to the reduced intralayer hopping parameter .",
    "for this reason we include a calculation in the bulk for @xmath81 ( since the intralayer hopping in this layer is half what it is elsewhere ) ; this is shown with open triangles joined by ( pink ) dot - dashed lines , and these results are in excellent quantitative agreement with the renormalized surface quasiparticle weights.@xcite thus , we find that essentially the entire change of the quasiparticle weight at the surface can be accounted for once the charge transfer effects are taken into consideration .",
    "in conclusion we have investigated the surface electronic properties of a doped mott insulator by applying the embedding approach for dmft . as a model system",
    ", we considered a semi - infinite hubbard model .",
    "we have shown that the reduced coordination number and probably reduced hopping elements at the surface causes an accumulation of charge at the surface in the strong coupling limit , that makes the surface approach the condition of half - filling more quickly than the bulk . the accumulation of charge at the surface , in turn , makes the correlation effects more effective .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated that the reduction of the quasiparticle weight detected by surface sensitive photoemission experiments of a doped mott insulator are caused by both charge transfer and enhanced correlation effects at the surface .",
    "the expected modification of the intra - layer hopping at the surface and inter - layer hopping between the surface and the subsurface layer lead to more significant differences between the surface and the bulk ."
