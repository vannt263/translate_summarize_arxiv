    "since the value of @xmath0 in the standard model ( sm ) is @xmath4 @xcite , a positive measurement of @xmath5 may be a signal that the radiation content of the universe was due not only to photons and sm neutrinos , but also to some additional light particle called generically `` dark radiation '' .",
    "in this paper we consider the possiblity that the dark radiation is made of the light sterile neutrinos ( see @xcite ) whose existence is indicated by recent results of short - baseline ( sbl ) neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite . in particular , we consider the simplest possibility of a 3 + 1 scheme , in which the three active flavor neutrinos @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , are mainly composed of three very light neutrinos @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , with masses much smaller than 1 ev and there is a sterile neutrino @xmath12 which is mainly composed of a new massive neutrino @xmath13 with mass @xmath14 .    the problem of the determination of @xmath0 from cosmological data is related to that of the hubble constant @xmath15 , because these two quantities are positively correlated in the analysis of the data ( see refs .",

    "we discuss this problem in section  [ cosmological ] , where we present the results of a fit of cosmological data with a prior on @xmath15 determined by the weighted average of the local astrophysical measurements .",
    "since the neutrino oscillation explanation of sbl data requires the existence of a massive neutrino at the ev scale , we discuss also the bounds on the effective sterile neutrino mass @xmath16 defined by the planck collaboration as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the reduced hubble constant , such that @xmath20 . here",
