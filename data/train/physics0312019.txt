    "over the last decade , the performance of positron emission tomography ( pet ) scanners have considerably improved .",
    "for instance , commercial cameras dedicated to small animals now feature a space resolution below 2  mm along with a sensitivity better than 1%  @xcite .",
    "no matter how beneficial this performance gain has been to users , for instrument designers , it has somehow hardened the challenge of finding new solutions which would go beyond the present instrumental limits at an affordable cost .",
    "this is why the complete simulation of new tep configurations under study has now become even more justified than in the past , and calls for the development of a dedicated simulation framework , sufficiently versatile to allow fast and very detailed approaches with the best - existing emulation of all the underlying physical processes .",
    "since its first public release in 1998 , the stability , the validity and hence the popularity of geant4  @xcite- the object - oriented particle tracking and transport simulation framework developed by the high energy physics community - have noticeably progressed . in our opinion , it has become the best toolkit from which any common and public tep simulation framework should be developed .",
    "gepetos : * ge*ant4 * p*ositron * e*mission * to*mography * s*imulation , is a first attempt that we have made over the last few years to reach this goal .",
    "as we aimed at providing the possibility to fully simulate all the processes taking place during the short life of a positron and then in the transport and interaction of its two 511  kev annihilation photons , efforts were made to check the validity of geant4 and if needed corrections or modifications were done .",
    "hence , we have added as part of gepetos the possibility to generate positrons according to their respective @xmath1 spectra for @xmath2f , @xmath3o , @xmath4c ( figure  [ enerf18 ] for @xmath2f ) .",
    "table [ tab : ener ] shows the good agreement between our simulation and experimental data for the maximum and the most probable energies for each spectrum . after this step ,",
    "the positrons are fully tracked down until they annihilate .",

    "_ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as geant4 presents the capability to transport and track charged particles in strong magnetic fields , we used gepetos to evaluate the potential image resolution gain of a p4 concorde @xmath0pet camera  @xcite which would be operated in the strong axial field of a mri scanner .",
    "we found no improvement for @xmath2f and a marginal gain for @xmath4c .",
    "however for @xmath3o and providing the device is operated in a 15  t solenoidal field , figures  [ fig : imagebfield1 ] and  [ fig : imagebfield2 ] show that the magnetic field allows to resolve two point - like sources separated by 4  mm .",
    "the physical explanation of this effect is very comparable to what happens in a tpc ( time projection chamber ) operated in a magnetic field .",
    "the axial magnetic field blocks the transaxial diffusion of electrons and confines them within a spiral around their creation points .",
    "our results are in good agreement with what was found in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "15  t mri scanners are now becoming available for small animals , but the operation of photo - sensors in such a strong magnetic field remains a very difficult challenge for the future .",

    "we have established the basis of a pet simulation package ( gepetos ) based on geant4 as a transport and tracking engine .",
    "gepetos has been validated against the available data of a siemens ecat exact hr+ pet scanner .",
    "we used gepetos to guide our development effort toward a lxe pet camera dedicated to the small animal imaging .",
    "the sources of gepetos can be freely downloaded from this site  @xcite .",
    "this work was made possible thanks to the financial grants allocated by the rhne - alpes region through its `` emergence '' science program and by cnrs / inserm via its ipa program dedicated to the small animal imaging .",
