    "what are the physical conditions leading to formation of different populations of young , isolated ( single ) neutron stars , namely anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , dim isolated neutron stars ( xdins ) , central compact objects ( ccos ) and rotating radio transients ( rrats ) ?",
    "all these systems involve a single , young or middle - aged neutron star ( see mereghetti 2011a for a recent review of isolated neutron stars ) . despite striking differences , like energetic soft gamma bursts peculiar to sgrs and axps , there are also striking similarities , like the periods of axp / sgrs and xdins being clustered in the same range ( @xmath2 s ) . considering the estimated birth rates of these objects together with the galactic supernova rate ,",
    "it is likely that there are evolutionary connections between some of these populations ( keane & kramer 2008 ) .",
    "recent efforts concentrate on the unification of the long - term x - ray luminosity and the rotational evolution of these neutron star systems in a single picture . with the assumption that these sources are evolving in vacuum with dipole torques ,",
    "their surface dipole fields , b , inferred from the dipole torque formula range from @xmath3 g for ccos to more than @xmath4 g for axp / sgrs . in this picture , the diversity of evolutionary paths is attributed to the differences in the initial dipole and the crustal toroidal fields of the sources ( kaspi 2010 ) .",
    "sources with magnetar dipole fields ( @xmath5 g ) are posited to go through a rapid field decay , which is required for the model to explain the recently discovered so - called low - b magnetars(turolla et al .",
    "2011 , rea et al . 2012 ) .",
    "evolution of the x - ray luminosities of these sources , which are much higher than the rotational powers , are suggested to be governed by the field decay history of the neutron stars depending on the initial crustal and dipole field strengths ( vigano et al .",
    "2013 ) . in this model ,",
    "the apparently missing link between ccos and other classes was suggested to be due to field burial to the crust by the accretion of the supernova matter in the early phase of evolution ( vigano & pons 2012 ) .",
    "the timescale for the subsequent reemergence and the growth of the field to its original strength is estimated to be @xmath6 yr depending on the initial conditions by the same authors .",
    "the dipole field s decay is supposed to proceed after the initial burial and re - emergence .",
    "if there are fallback disks around these systems the picture is rather different .",
    "it was proposed by alpar ( 2001 ) that the source properties , in particular the period clustering , could be explained by the presence ( or absence ) and the properties of fallback disks around these systems .",
    "fallback disk models do not involve burial , re - emergence or decay of the dipole field , which is taken to be constant at its initial value .",
    "neutron stars with fallback disks and conventional dipole magnetic fields @xmath7 g ) could evolve into the x - ray luminosity , period and period derivative range of axp / sgrs on timescales of @xmath8 a few @xmath9 yr ( ertan et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the infrared ( ir ) and optical emission properties of these sources in the quiescent state are consistent with the emission from an irradiated active disk ( ertan et al .",
    "2007 , ertan & 2006 ) .",
    "the model fits to optical and ir data also constrain the dipole field strength to below @xmath10 g on the surface of the star ( ertan et al .",
    "recently discovered low - b magnetars  sgr 0418 + 5729 ( rea et al .",
    "2013 ) and swift j1822.3@xmath111606 ( scholz et al . 2012 ) clearly showed that the sgr bursts do not require magnetar strength dipole fields .",
    "this suggests that the sgr bursts could be powered by the quadrupole or higher multipole fields which are localized close to the surface and do not affect the rotation history of the star .",
    "the inner disk applies torque on the star through interaction with the large - scale dipole component of the magnetic field .",
    "the x - ray luminosity and the rotational properties of the low - b magnetarsand the so - called high - b radio pulsar  psr j1734@xmath113333 , including its anomalous braking index n = 0.9 @xmath12 0.2 ( espinoza et al .",
    "2011 ) , can also be reproduced by the same model and with @xmath13 g. as an independent and complementary support for this model , recent analyses show that the high energy spectra of axp / sgrs could be produced in their accretion columns consistently with the accretion rates of these sources inferred from the x - ray luminosities ( trmper et al . 2010 , 2013 ; kylafis , trmper & ertan 2014 ) .",
    "these results obtained from the application of the same model with similar basic parameters to sources with rather different observational properties encourages us to investigate the evolution and possible evolutionary links between axp / sgrs ( see mereghetti 2008 ; 2011b for recent reviews ) and other young neutron star populations .",
    "this will help us understand the differences in the initial conditions that lead to emergence of different classes of neutron stars .",
    "in particular , understanding whether there is a relation between the disk masses and the dipole field strengths requires detailed investigations of axp / sgrs and other young neutron star populations . in the present work ,",
    "we concentrate on the dim isolated neutron stars ( xdins ) .    at present , there are seven known dim isolated neutron stars ( haberl 2007 ; turolla 2009 ) .",
    "all these sources lie within a distance of @xmath14 pc .",
    "since the solar neighborhood is part of the gould belt , a ring of young stellar systems , the relatively high rate of supernova events in the gould belt should be taken into account in estimating the birth rate of xdins . in the vicinity of the sun ,",
    "about two thirds of the neutron stars are born in the gould belt , while the remaining fraction belongs to the galactic disk ( grenier 2000 ) .",
    "assuming the ages of xdins are @xmath15 myr , simple statistical calculations give a galactic birth rate of @xmath16 century@xmath17 ( popov , turolla & possenti 2006 ) .",
    "the thermal x - ray luminosities of xdins are in the @xmath18 erg s@xmath17 range .",
    "the ages corresponding to these luminosities on the theoretical cooling curves are a few @xmath9 yr . kinematic ages of four xdins estimated from the space velocities and likely birth places are , with large uncertainties , in the range of @xmath19 myr ( motch et al .",
    "2009 ; tetzlaff et al .",
    "2010 ; mignani et al .",
    "these kinematic ages and the cooling ages estimated from the x - ray luminosities of xdins , imply that the characteristic ages , estimated assuming isolated pulsar spin - down , @xmath20 myr , could be significantly greater than the true ages of these sources .",
    "xdins do not show pulsed radio emission .",
    "weak radio emission from two sources were reported ( malofeev , malov & teplykh 2007 ) , but not confirmed yet ( turolla 2009 ; haberl 2007 ) .",
    "strength of the surface dipole fields of xdins inferred from the dipole torque formula are @xmath21 g. if these sources are indeed evolving in vacuum with dipole torques , many of them should be active as radio pulsars .",
    "nondetection of radio pulses from these sources might be due to narrow beaming angles of long - period system .",
    "nevertheless it is not clear why a large population of galactic xdins with rotational properties of the known sources do not show up as radio pulsars .",
    "alternatively , these sources may not have sufficiently strong dipole fields for radio emission .",
    "our results support the latter possibility . in the present work ,",
    "we try to explain the long - term evolution of xdins in the frame of the fallback disk model as applied earlier to axp / sgrs and psr j1734@xmath113333 .",
    "we also discuss the radio properties of xdins based on the predictions of our evolutionary model .",
    "we briefly describe the model in section 2 .",
    "the results of the simulations are given in section 3 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "we use the code developed to investigate the long - term evolution of axps and sgrs ( see ertan & erkut 2008 ; ertan et al . 2009 ; alpar et al .",

    "we examine the period , the period derivative and the total x - ray luminosity evolution of the model sources , tracing the initial conditions , namely the initial period , @xmath22 , strength of the magnetic dipole field on the pole of the star , @xmath1 , and the initial disk mass , @xmath23 .",
    "in addition to these initial parameters , the evolution is also affected by the irradiation efficiency @xmath24 and the minimum critical temperature , @xmath25 , for the disk to be viscously active . the magneto - rotational instability",

    "we assume that there is no accretion onto the neutron star .",
    "we solve the diffusion equation for an extended disk with an initial surface - density distribution in the power - law form , @xmath39 , which is the characteristic surface - density profile for steady thin accretion disks ( see e.g. frank , king & raine 2002 ) . at a given time , the temperature in the disk decreases with increasing radial distance @xmath40 from the center . at a given @xmath40 ,",
    "the temperature decreases with time because of fallback disk evolution and decreasing irradiation strength.in the calculations , for numerical reasons , we start with @xmath41 cm .",
    "after the first time step , the radius at which the disk temperature is as low as the minimum temperature @xmath25 for the disk to be active is identified as the dynamical outer radius , @xmath42 , of the viscously active disk .",
    "as the temperatures , starting from the outermost disk , decrease below @xmath25 , @xmath42 propagates inward .",
    "the x - ray irradiation of the disk is important in the evolution of the neutron star , since it prolongs the lifetime of the disk by delaying the inward propagation of @xmath42 .",

    ", we found the value of the irradiation efficiency @xmath24 to be in the range of @xmath45 which is similar to the range of @xmath24 estimated for low - mass x - ray binaries ( dubus et al .",

    "similar evolutionary curves can be obtained by changing @xmath25 only by a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "the range of @xmath24 obtained in our earlier work constrains @xmath25 to below @xmath47 k ( ertan et al . 2009 ) , consistent with the results of inutsuka & sano ( 2005 ) .",
    "accretion onto the surface of the neutron star is the dominant source of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the accretion rate , @xmath48 , is related to the x - ray luminosity through @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the radius of the neutron star . in the fallback disk model of axp / sgrs ,",
    "the sources are in the propeller regime and a fraction of the matter arriving at the inner disk radius is accreted onto the star ( alpar 2001 ; chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ) .",
    "this can be written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "for simplicity , we take @xmath53 in all our calculations .",
    "similar results can be obtained with @xmath54 .",
    "depending on the initial conditions , the sources can enter the accretion phase at different epochs of the evolution .",
    "some sources may never enter the accretion phase and probably continue their evolution as radio pulsars until their rotational power is no longer sufficient to produce pulsed radio emission .",
    "other sources , with different initial conditions , may evolve through an initial pulsar phase into a subsequent accretion epoch .",
    "when accretion is not possible , that is , when the inner disk can not penetrate the light cylinder , the x - ray emission is mainly due to intrinsic cooling of the star . for the cooling luminosity , @xmath55",
    ", we use the theoretical cooling curves calculated for the neutron stars with conventional magnetic dipole fields ( page 2009 ) . in the luminosity calculation , in addition to @xmath55 we also include the intrinsic dissipative heating of the neutron star under the dipole and disk torques acting on the star ( alpar 2007 ) .",
    "we use the @xmath56 prescription for the kinematic viscosity @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the local sound speed and the pressure scale - height of the disk respectively ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . in the long - term evolution of the disk , the mass - flow rate from the outer to the inner disk",
    "is determined by the viscosities in the cold outer disk . following the results of the detailed work on the x - ray enhancement light curves of axp / sgrs ( & ertan 2012 ) we take @xmath60 .",
    "the disk could remain stable ( i.e. , not blown away by radiation pressure ) when @xmath61 for a certain range of @xmath30 values depending on the angle @xmath62 between the magnetic dipole and the rotation axes of the neutron star ( eki & alpar 2005 ) .",
    "the maximum @xmath30 for the disk to remain stable is a few @xmath36 for large @xmath62 , while the disk is stable for all @xmath30 values if the axes are aligned ( eki & alpar 2005 ) .",
    "even if the disk remains stable , it can not apply an efficient torque on the star if the inner disk loses contact with the closed field lines .",
    "an alternative and stronger possibility in this regime is that the inner disk matter can not be propelled efficiently from the system and piles up at the inner disk . in this case , because of the increasing surface - density gradient at the inner disk , @xmath30 approaches to @xmath36 and a steady state is reached with an inner disk that remains in contact with the closed dipole field lines .",

    "the model curves given in figure 3 are obtained with @xmath25 values that remain in a narrow range between 80 and 110 k. assuming that axp / sgrs and xdins have similar disk compositions , we expect that they have similar critical temperatures",
    ". the irradiation efficiency might change with the accretion rate ; it is expected to be similar for sources in the same accretion regime .",
    "we perform simulations tracing all possible values of @xmath23 and @xmath1 with @xmath137 ms . for the model sources that can enter the accretion phase , the source properties at the end of this phase are not sensitive to @xmath22 ( ertan et al .",
    "for all xdins , the @xmath1 values that can produce the reasonable evolutionary curves remain in the @xmath138 g range .",
    "the ranges of model parameters that can produce the individual properties of the six xdins are listed in table 1 .     and @xmath1 that can produce the source properties ( see table 1 ) . here , we show illustrative model curves that can represent the long - term evolution of these xdins .",
    "the values of @xmath1 and @xmath23 used in the models are given in the top panel in units of @xmath101 g and @xmath125 respectively . ]",
    "values inferred from the dipole torque formula .",
    "vertical bars show the ranges of @xmath1 that can produce the properties of the sources in the fallback disk model ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "it is seen that all these sources remain below the lower boundary of the death valley ( death line ) indicating that these xdins can not be normal radio pulsars , if they are evolving with fallback disks . ]",
    "our results imply that all six xdins completed the long - term accretion phase .",
    "they are not accreting matter from the disk at present , while they are still being slowed down by the disk torques . without accretion , these sources are free to emit pulsed radio emission .",
    "however , the dipole fields @xmath1 inferred in the fallback disk model are significantly weaker than those inferred from the dipole torque formula , so that at present the xdins do not have sufficient voltages to sustain pulsed radio emission .",
    "allowed ranges of @xmath1 values for each xdin are given in table 1 and plotted in figure 4 .",
    "all these sources are indeed well below the lower border of the radio pulsar death valley in the extended galactic population , and are not expected to show radio pulses .",
    "younger xdins with shorter periods should be able to emit radio pulses , but they would still be evolving in the long - term accretion phase during which mass - flow onto the neutron star hinders the radio emission . once the accretion epoch is over ,",
    "xdins have weak rotational power and are not likely to produce radio emission .",
    "the inner disk conditions of xdins in the efficient propeller phase could be rather different from those of persistent axps in the accretion phase , for which the boundary layer extends down to the co - rotation radius in a steady state with magnetic heating in the boundary layer negligible compared to viscous dissipation ( rappaport , fregeau & spruit 2004 ) .",
    "by contrast , in the propeller phase , magnetic heating in the boundary layer could be a significant extra heating source in addition to viscous dissipation and irradiation .",
    "this additional heating in the propeller phase can supply the difference ( @xmath139 orders of magnitude ) between the observed r band flux ( kaplan et al .",
    "2011 ) and the model calculation , for an irradiated face on thin disk .",
    "a calculation of the magnetic heating is beyond the scope of the present work ; a detailed study is in progress and will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "we have examined the long - term evolution of the six xdin sources , with measured @xmath76 out of the current total 7 xdins .",
    "first , we find that the fallback disk model is successful in producing the observed individual properties of all these sources .",
    "xdin properties are obtained after the source has gone through a past accretion phase with spin - down , with the fallback disk protruding into the neutron star s magnetosphere . at present , the fallback disk is tracking the light cylinder , with continuing spin - down under the disk torques , but no accretion onto the neutron star .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of xdins are provided by cooling .",
    "next , tracing the initial parameters , we have determined the allowed ranges of the dipole field strength on the pole of the star , @xmath1 , and the disk mass , @xmath23 , for each source ( table 1 ) .",
    "our results constrain the @xmath1 values of the six xdins into the @xmath140 g range . comparing this range of dipole field strength with earlier results obtained by ertan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for axp / sgrs , we surmise that xdins tend to have dipole fields weaker than those of most known axp / sgrs .",
    "this result should be confirmed through further detailed work on the persistent and transient axp / sgrs .",
    "reasonable evolutionary model curves for xdins can be obtained with a wide range of initial fallback disk masses , @xmath23 , for all sources ( table 1 ) .",
    "we could not test whether there is a correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath1 , since our results do not constrain the disk masses .",
    "for the sources that do not accrete at present , like xdins , it is not possible to constrain the initial mass of the disk in most cases .",
    "a possible @xmath141 correlation could be tested through further investigation of persistent axp / sgrs which are powered by accretion onto the star .",
    "this analysis will help us understand the differences in the initial conditions of different young neutron star populations .",
    "all known xdins are close - by objects within @xmath14 pc of the sun . statistical analysis considering the properties of the gould belt gives a galactic birth rate of @xmath142 1 century@xmath17 ( popov et al .",
    "2006 ; see also section 1 ) .",
    "this raises a critical question for the models : only the xdins in the solar neighborhood are observable in x - rays",
    ". the inferred large galactic population should be detectable in the radio band if they are active radio pulsars .",
    "if these sources evolve in vacuum without fallback disks , their dipole field on the pole of the star can be estimated as @xmath143 g. observed @xmath77 and @xmath76 values give @xmath144 g. it is expected to see these sources as radio pulsars , if xdins indeed slow down by magnetic dipole torques with these strong fields .",
    "five out of seven xdin sources , located within 0.4 kpc , have periods greater than 7 s. among the currently known radio pulsars in the atnf pulsar catalog ( manchester et al .",
    "2005 ) , there is only a single radio pulsar with @xmath145s ( @xmath146 s ) and @xmath147 g which is located at a distance of 3.3 kpc .",
    "we are not sure whether this can be accounted for with the selection effects and even the most conservative beaming fraction formulas for the long - period systems , if xdins and radio pulsars with large dipole magnetic fields are taken to be members of the same population . a detailed population synthesis or statistical analysis",
    "will not be attempted here .    this problem encountered in the dipole torque model",
    "is naturally resolved in the fallback disk model . during the initial long - term accretion phase radio emission",
    "is suppressed due to mass - flow onto the star .",
    "is it possible to observe pulsed radio emission from these sources after the mass accretion terminates ?",
    "the neutron stars that evolve like the six xdins we studied here are not likely to produce beamed radio emission when accretion stops , because : ( 1 ) their dipole fields are much weaker than inferred from the dipole torque formula ( table 1 ) , and ( 2 ) at the end of the accretion phase , they have already attained long periods . in figure 3 , accretion phases correspond to the epochs with constant @xmath76 given in the lower panel .",
    "the period at the end of the accretion phase corresponds to a location in the @xmath148 plane which is already below the lower border of the death valley .",
    "subsequent evolution moves the source even further away from the death valley , to the present locations shown in figure 4 .    to sum up : ( 1 ) the rotational properties and the x - ray luminosities of xdins",
    "can be explained by the fallback disk model that was employed earlier to explain the general properties of axp / sgrs ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the main disk parameters used in the present work for different xdin sources are similar to each other and also to those used in the long - term evolution models of axp / sgrs ( table 1 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the distinction between xdins and axp / sgrs seems to be that the former have weaker dipole magnetic fields . finally ,",
    "( 3 ) the model can also account for non - detection of many radio pulsars evolving to the properties of known xdins .",
    "a neutron star with a conventional dipole field must have passed through the long - term accretion phase to acquire the periods of known xdins within the cooling timescale . in the accretion phase ,",
    "the radio emission is quenched by the mass flow onto the neutron star .",
    "after termination of the accretion phase , the sources no longer have sufficient rotational power for radio emission .",
