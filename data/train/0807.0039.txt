    "the recent measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and polarization @xcite , alone or in combination with other cosmological data sets , have provided confirmation of the standard cosmological model and an accurate determination of some of its key parameters .    in particular , the new determination of the age of the universe @xmath6 gyrs improves by an order of magnitude previous determinations from , e.g. , cosmochronology of long - lived radioactive nuclei @xcite and population synthesis of the oldest stellar populations @xcite and by a factor of 2 previous determinations from cmb data .    with cosmological parameters so tightly constrained within the framework of the standard flat-@xmath1cdm model , it is important however to constrain possible deviations from the standard cosmological model . beyond the primordial parameters describing the shape of the primordial power spectrum and late - time parameters such as the optical depth to the last scattering surface , cmb observations",
    "so far constrain directly parameters such as @xcite the angular size distance to last scattering combined with the sound horizon at decoupling , the baryon - to - photon ratio and the redshift of matter radiation equality .",
    "this implies that , for models beyond the standard flat-@xmath1cdm , cmb data alone still show large degeneracies among  derived \" , @xmath7 , etc .. ] cosmological parameters such as the matter density parameter @xmath8 , the curvature @xmath9 , the dark energy equation of state paramenter @xmath10 , the effective number of relativistic neutrino species @xmath11 , the sum of neutrino masses @xmath12 and the hubble parameter @xmath13 . for example ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , departures from the standard model described by a deviation from @xmath14 neutrino species , can arise from the decay of dark matter particles @xcite , quintessence @xcite , exotic models @xcite , and additional hypothetical relativistic particles .",
    "this affects the matter - radiation equality yielding , even for a flat , cosmological constant - dominated model , a degeneracy between @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath8 .",
    "a departure from dark energy being described by a cosmological constant ( i.e. a component with equation of state @xmath15 ) , yields a different angular size distance to last scattering , and thus degeneracy between @xmath10 , @xmath13 and @xmath8 even for a flat universe . finally , relaxing the flatness assumption yields the so - called  geometric degeneracy \" ( between age or @xmath13 and @xmath8 and @xmath16 ) .    in order to go beyond the concordance @xmath1cdm model parameters determination",
    ", one needs extra data sets that probe different physics and are affected by different systematics . in this work we concentrate on the measurements of @xmath0 using passively evolving red - envelope galaxies and how using them helps to constrain cosmological parameters dropping the assumption of the concordance model .",
    "in particular we show that the recent determinations of @xmath13 from the hst key project @xcite and @xmath0 provided by @xcite ( svj ; based on @xcite and references therein ) can provide , when combined with cmb and other cosmological data , new and tighter constraints on deviations from the standard @xmath1cdm model , as first shown in @xcite .",
    "this approach of combining different data - sets to constrain parameters that are otherwise poorly constrained , is called  concordance approach \" .",
    "while it is a very powerful approach , the same  concordance \" approach is used to test data sets for systematic errors .",
    "it is therefore important to consider enough data sets to have an over - constrained problem and as diverse data sets as possible , relying on different physics and affected by different systematics . only in this case , if all data sets agree , one can be confident that the systematic errors are safely below the statistical errors and that the cosmological constraints are robust .    after obtaining constraints on deviations from the simple @xmath1cdm model obtained with wmap 5-years data and @xmath0 measurements , we compare them with those obtained from the combination of wmap 5-years with baryon acoustic oscillations and",
    "supernovae data .",
    "we find good agreement between the two approaches .",
    "we conclude that any possible systematic effect in the non - cmb data sets is below the statistical errors , and that there is no evidence for a deviation from the flat-@xmath1cdm model , thus offering support to the standard cosmological model .",
    "the method to extract cosmological parameters from the different datasets that we adopt is based on the publicly available markov chain monte carlo package ` cosmomc ` @xcite and the sampling of the posterior distribution given by monte carlo markov chains released with the wmap 5-years data @xcite .",
    "the standard @xmath1cdm model is described by the following set of cosmological parameters : the physical baryon and cdm densities , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the density parameter of dark energy @xmath16 , the scalar spectral index , @xmath19 and amplitude @xmath20 , and the optical depth to reionization , @xmath21 .",
    "for all these parameters the chosen boundaries of the priors do not affect the cosmological constraints .",
    "we consider deviations from this model described by the addition of a single extra parameter .",
    "the models which show a significant degeneracy between @xmath0 and the additional parameter are : models where we add the possibility of having an extra - background of relativistic particles ( parametrized by @xmath22 ) , or where we fix the effective number of neutrinos to @xmath23 but allow them to have significant non zero mass @xmath24 , models where we consider the possibility of a ( constant ) dark energy equation of state @xmath25 , and finally models with non - flat geometry @xmath26 .",
    "we then study how determinations of the rate of expansion @xmath0 can constrain these deviations .",
    "we consider the hubble key project determination of the hubble constant @xcite ( hst ) and the determination of the redshift dependence of the hubble parameter @xmath0 from observations of passively evolving galaxies @xcite ( svj ) .",
    "this combination ( wmap5+hst+ages ) is referred to as  wmap5+h \" .",
    "finally , we also consider a model which deviates from the standard @xmath1cdm by the addition of two parameters : @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and investigate how the @xmath0 data helps break the cmb - only degeneracy .    to conclude , we compare these constraints to those obtained with the combination wmap 5-years with supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations ( @xcite ) .",
    "this combination is referred to as  wmap5+sn+bao \" .",
    "an important observable to constrain cosmological parameters is a direct measurement of the hubble parameter @xmath27 , as this measures directly the expansion rate of the universe at a given redshift .",
    "for example , @xmath0 is a more direct measurement of the equation of state of dark energy than the angular diameter distance @xmath28 or the luminosity distance @xmath29 .",
    "this is easy to see by recalling that , adopting a frw metric , using einstein s equations and considering a flat universe composed of matter and dark energy with equation of state @xmath30 , @xmath31 $ ] and thus @xmath32 \\right ] ^{1/2},\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 refer respectively to the dark energy , the matter , and the total contents .",
    "the quantities @xmath28 and @xmath29 are related to @xmath0 via @xmath36 .    while some of the current constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath37 , are based on integrated measurements of @xmath0 ( like the angular - diameter distance ) , other observables",
    "have already provided direct measurements of @xmath0 , like the determination of the star populations of luminous red galaxies @xcite .",
    "other techniques that can provide a direct measurement of @xmath0 are the power spectrum of the peculiar velocities , as measured , for example , by the ksz effect @xcite or the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) scale in the radial direction @xcite .",
    "the bao technique has recently received renewed attention because its potential to provide a standard ruler at different redshifts , and because of its robustness to systematic effects ; it is thus being considered a powerful method to determine the nature of dark energy .    in this paper",
    "we constrain cosmological parameters for models beyond the standard @xmath1cdm , using the @xmath0 determinations provided by @xcite , obtained from the study of the evolution of the star populations in massive ( @xmath38 ) luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) .",
    "recent studies @xcite have clearly established that masive lrg have formed more than 95% of their stars at redshifts higher than 4 .",
    "these galaxies , therefore , form a very uniform population , whose stars are evolving passively after the very first short episode of active star formation @xcite . because the stars evolve passively , these massive lrg are excellent cosmic clocks , i.e. they provide a direct measurement of @xmath39 ; the observational evidence discards further star formation activity in these galaxies .",
    "dating of the stellar population can be achieved by modeling the integrated light of the stellar population using synthetic stellar population models , in a similar way to what is done for open and globular clusters in the milky way .",
    "the dating of the stellar population needs to be done on the integrated spectrum because individual stars are not resolved and therefore the requirements on the observed spectrum are stringent as one needs a very wide wavelength coverage , spectral resolution and very high signal - to - noise . in  @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the spectra of these massive lrg at a redshift @xmath40 are extremely similar , with differences of only 0.02 mag , which is another evidence of the uniformity of the stellar populations in these galaxies .",
    "there have already been examples of accurate dating of the stellar populations in lrgs @xcite where it has been shown that galaxy spectra with sufficient wavelength coverage ( the uv region is crucial ) , wavelength resolution ( about 3 ) and enough @xmath41 ( at least 10 per resolution element of 3 ) can provide sensible constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 data obtained from these studies and used in this paper , are the points with error - bars shown in figure  [ fig : h(z ) ] .",
    "the interested reader can find more details in @xcite .",
