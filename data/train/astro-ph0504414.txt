    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are semi - detached , interacting binaries consisting of a white dwarf and a late - type star ( hereafter , the companion ) that overflows its roche lobe . in most cases",
    "the overflowing material settles into a disk around the white dwarf before accreting onto its surface . at the point where the stream of material from the companion collides / interacts with the accretion disk a `` hot - spot '' or `` bulge '' forms .",
    "much of our understanding of the three - dimensional structure of cv disks has been obtained from studying their light curves ; for cvs seen nearly edge - on , light curves show broad modulations ( either in emission or absorption , depending on the wavelength regime ) and deep eclipses .",
    "the broad modulation is due to the hot - spot orbiting with the binary system and the eclipses are due to occultation of the white dwarf and/or hot - spot by the companion ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a subset of the cvs , the so - called magnetic cvs , contain white dwarfs with magnetic fields that are sufficiently strong to force the accreting material away from the orbital plane of the binary and onto one or both of the white dwarf s magnetic poles .",
    "the accreting material approaches the white dwarf supersonically and so passes through a stand - off shock before cooling and settling onto the surface of the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the material in the shock is hot ( @xmath0100  kev ) , so magnetic cvs are powerful x - ray sources .",
    "magnetic cvs are divided into two subclasses : polars and intermediate polars ( ips ) . in polars",
    "the stars are tidally locked ; this `` static '' configuration results in an accretion flow from the inner lagrangian point of the binary along the magnetic field lines of the white dwarf onto its magnetic pole(s ) . in ips ,",
    "where the white dwarf is spinning faster than the orbital period , matter also accretes onto the white dwarf along the magnetic field lines , but it first accumulates in an accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the x - ray light curves of the ip ex  hydrae(hereafter , ex  hya ) obtained with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "( _ chandra _ ) high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) spectrometer and the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ euve _ ) deep survey ( ds ) photometer .",
    "ex  hya  consists of a @xmath1 white dwarf with a spin / rotation period of 67 minutes and a @xmath2 companion @xcite .",
    "the binary system has an orbital period of 98 minutes and an inclination @xmath3 .",
    "ex  hya  light curves have been studied extensively in the optical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    the x - ray white dwarf light curve , i.e. , the observed flux as a function of the white dwarf spin phase ( hereafter ) shows a broad sinusoidal modulation that peaks around @xmath4 .",
    "its amplitude increases with increasing wavelength of the emission .",
    "two origins have been suggested for this broad modulation .",
    "one is the `` accretion curtain '' model @xcite , in which the pre - shock material absorbs emission created in the post - shock region .",
    "since the pre - shock material is confined to the magnetic field , its projected column density changes as the white dwarf rotates , hence the amount of absorption varies ( see figures 7 and 8 of * ? ? ?",
    "the other is the occultation model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the  modulation is due to occultation of the emission by the limb of the white dwarf .",
    "the x - ray binary light curve of ex  hya , i.e. , the observed flux as a function of binary phase ( hereafter ) , shows two main features : a broad modulation , thought to be due to photoelectric absorption of white dwarf and accretion column emission by the hot spot or bulge material on the accretion disk , and a sharp partial eclipse , due to the occultation of the lower accretion pole of the white dwarf by the companion ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this paper focuses on the binary light curve using data obtained with _",

    "4 discusses the results , and   5 presents the conclusions .",
    "ex  hya  was observed by using the hetg in combination with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer in its spectroscopy layout ( acis - s ) on 2000 may 18 for 60 ks .",
    "the observation was continuous and covers @xmath0 orbital revolutions of the binary system and @xmath5 rotations of the white dwarf .",
    "we reduced the data using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao version 3.0 ) software package , making only two departures from the standard reduction : ( 1 ) we turned randomization off to minimize any artificial line broadening ( i.e. , we set _ rand_pix_size _ equal to zero in the _ tg_resolve_events _ tool ; note that in ciao version 3.1 and later _ rand_pix_size",
    "_ = 0 is the default setting ) , and ( 2 ) we applied a solar system barycentric correction so that the event times are in barycentric dynamical time instead of spacecraft time .",
    "light curves were constructed using the ciao tool _",
    "we note that since the hetg grating spectra span several ccds on the acis detector , it is recommended in the _ dmextract _ documentation that light curves be extracted for each ccd individually so that the correct good time interval ( gti ) table for each ccd is used ( the gtis usually differ from ccd to ccd ) .",
    "the individual ccd light curves can then be combined to form the correct light curve , for example , a spectral order light curve . for the ex  hya",
    "observation , the gtis for acis ccds # 4 through # 9 differed by less than 6.6  s , or @xmath6 of the 60  ks integration time , so we chose to ignore this small difference and extract the light curves for spectral orders spanning several ccds in the same extraction ( in this case the first gti table available to _ dmextract _ is used , i.e. , the ccd # 7 gti , which contains the zeroth order ) .",
    "we generated light curves for the combined first orders of the high energy grating ( heg ) and medium energy grating ( meg ) as a function of binary phase  for the optical ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we created light curves for the following wavelength intervals : 15  , 510  , 1015  , and 1520  . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we refer to these light curves as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 indicates the wavelength range .",
    "we also generated light curves for the hetg background and conclude that they are constant with time and account for less than 0.4% of the signal in the source light curves .",
    "ex  hya  was observed by _",
    "@xcite between 2000 may 2 and 2000 june 15 .",
    "the data were extracted from the heasarc data archive in the form of 11 fits - format events files , which were manipulated with custom idl software developed over many years of _ euve _ observations of cataclysmic variables ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "source counts were collected from a 2 arcmin radius circle centered on ex hya , while background counts were collected from a surrounding annulus having an inner radius of 3 arcmin and an outer radius of 5.385 arcmin ( such that the ratio of source to background areas was 1:5 ) . after discarding numerous short ( @xmath9  s ) data intervals comprising less than 1% of the total exposure , we `` manually '' adjusted the start and stop times of the nominal good time intervals to include only those times when the source was above earth s limb and the background and primbsch / deadtime correction was low .",
    "this filtering resulted in 719 good time intervals for a total exposure of 967 ks .",
    "event times were corrected from spacecraft time to hjd , hjd was converted to binary phase using the ephemeris of @xcite , phase - folded source @xmath10 , background @xmath11 , and primbsch - weighted exposure @xmath12 light curves were accumulated , and the background - subtracted light curves and errors were calculated as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows the _ chandra _ light curves of ex  hyafolded on the binary phase . a narrow partial eclipse is visible around @xmath15 , as is the broad modulation centered on @xmath16 .",
    "we discuss the eclipse and the broad modulation separately in the following two sections .",
    "we measured the position and duration of the eclipse by fitting @xmath7 for @xmath17 $ ] , using 10 s bins ( or 0.0017 in ) , with a second - order polynomial to represent the overall shape of the light curve , and a gaussian to represent the eclipse ( note that the bins used for the fit are much smaller than those shown in fig .",

    "we found for @xmath1820   ) that the eclipse is centered on @xmath19 , which is slightly ( 31 s ) before the time of eclipse predicted by the ephemeris of @xcite , but well within its errors ( @xmath20 at the time of the observation ) .",
    "the eclipse has a fwhm of @xmath21 or @xmath22  s , and has an eclipse deficit of @xmath23 .",
    "we find no evidence , at the @xmath24 level , for any dependence of the time of eclipse , its width , or its deficit with wavelength ( see table  [ tab:2 ] ) .",
    "the fwhm of the eclipse is in good agreement with the measurement by @xcite of @xmath25  s based on 49 eclipses observed with _",

    "* ) .      the broad modulation in the ex  hya  binary light curve is thought to be due to absorption by the hot spot or bulge on the accretion disk . in our first attempt to describe the broad modulation , we modeled the light curves assuming a constant count rate and two gaussians : a narrow one centered on @xmath28 representing the eclipse discussed in the previous section , and a broad one centered on @xmath16 representing the broad modulation .",
    "table  [ tab:2 ] lists the centroids , fwhm , and depth of the gaussian fit to the broad modulation and the fits are shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] .    as has been reported before ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the depth of the broad modulation becomes more pronounced for the longer wavelengths .",
    "however , we also find that the phase of the minimum of the broad modulation changes with wavelength . both of these trends continue into the euv wavelength band , as can be seen from figures  [ fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] , which show the _ chandra _ hetg @xmath185   ) , @xmath2910   ) , @xmath3015   ) , and @xmath3120   ) light curves and the _ euve _ ds @xmath32180   ) light curve .",
    "we argue below that the shift in the phase of the minimum of the broad modulation ( hereafter ) with wavelength from x - rays to the euv is most likely due to a variation with  in the photoelectric absorption characteristics of the absorbing material .      in the following ,",
    "we assume that the bulge dip can be modeled by a single column density that fully covers the source of x - ray and euv light . in this case",

    "we assume that the source spectrum is constant with , that the abundances are solar @xcite , and that the photoelectric cross sections are as given by @xcite",
    ". with these assumptions , variations in @xmath33 with  can be due to changes in the column density and/or the ionization state of the absorbing material .    to investigate the hypothesis that a changing ionization state could produce the ex  hya  light curves , we consider two physical processes that affect the ionization state of the absorbing material : collisional ionization ( ci ) and photoionization ( pi ) .",
    "for both processes we assume that the absorber is optically thin and has a homogeneous ionization balance ( but see   3.4 ) . with these assumptions , the ionization balance is given for ci by the temperature @xmath47 and for pi by the ionization parameter @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the luminosity ( in @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 is the h density ( in @xmath52 ) , and @xmath53 is the separation between the absorber and the source of the ionizing radiation ( in cm ) . in the ci case , we assume that the ionization fractions are as given by @xcite as a function of @xmath54 . in the pi case , we calculated the ionization fractions with the cloudy photoionization code @xcite as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "in addition to @xmath49 , @xmath51 , and @xmath53 , it is necessary in cloudy to specify the shape of the ionizing spectrum . for this",
    ", we used a combination of ( 1 ) a multi - temperature apec @xcite thermal plasma model fit to the _ chandra _ data , representing the emission from the accretion columns , ( 2 ) a blackbody spectrum to represent the white dwarf surface ( radius @xmath56  cm and temperature @xmath57  k , * ? ? ?",

    "we thus assume that the absorber is photoionized from only one side by the white dwarf and accretion columns .",
    "the ionizing radiation from the disk and the companion are negligible and can be ignored .",

    "consistent with @xcite , we set the total luminosity @xmath74 between 1  ryd and 1000  ryd , which results in luminosities of 13 , 3 , 1.5 , and @xmath75 @xmath76 in the @xmath77  kev , 0.281.0  kev , 0.0670.028  kev , and 0.01360.067  kev bands , respectively .",

    "the fits are poorly determined outside the @xmath87 $ ] interval due to the fact that no appreciable absorption is present , so we do not show the fit parameters in this region .",
    "based on the trends shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] we fitted @xmath47 and @xmath82 by a linear function : @xmath89 where @xmath90 represents either @xmath47 or @xmath82 , and fitted @xmath86 by a gaussian",

    "this difference is readily explained by the fact that the other studies assumed neutral absorbers , while our model of the _ chandra _ and _ euve _ light curves requires a partially ionized absorber .",
    "specifically , we require an absorber with no or opacity ; in our model , most of the absorption in the _ euve _ wavelength band is due to .    given the parameters inferred for our fits to @xmath40 , it is possible to draw a schematic picture of the location and extent of the absorbing material in ex  hya . in the sketch shown in figure  4 , we have assumed that the inner edge of the disk lies at @xmath93  cm @xcite and that the outer edge of the disk lies at @xmath94  cm ( 75% of the white dwarf roche lobe radius of @xmath95  cm , * ? ? ?",

    "the absorber can be drawn on this figure if we assume that its density @xmath96 is constant with  and its thickness @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "two representative absorbers are shown in the figure for @xmath100 and @xmath101 and @xmath102 and @xmath103 .    in the pi case ,",
    "additional constraints are imposed on the absorber by the definition of the ionization parameter .",
    "eliminating @xmath51 between the relationships @xmath104 and @xmath105 gives @xmath106 , where @xmath107 and @xmath53 are expressed in units of @xmath81  cm .",
    "this is further constrained by the requirement @xmath108 so that the ionization parameter does not vary significantly from the front to the back of the absorber .",
    "these constraints are satisfied only if the absorber is very near the white dwarf : for @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "however , this analysis requires that the pi absorber be optically thin to the ionizing radiation , while figure 3 shows that during the dip the _ euve _ light curve is extinguished by approximately 95% , corresponding to an optical depth @xmath112 .      to allow the possibility of an optically thick pi absorber",
    ", we ran a set of full cloudy models to account for the dilution of the radiation field and the resulting change of the ionization balance with depth into the absorber .",
    "the dashed curve in the middle panel of figure  [ fig:6 ] shows the full cloudy light curves based on our best fit paramaters of the optically thin model for @xmath113  cm .",
    "this clearly shows that including the optical depth effects and physical size of the absorber results in more absorption , particularly at the longer wavelengths .",
    "we are able to produce full cloudy models that fit our light curves as well as we did for the ci and optically thin pi models , but these models require that the inner radius of the absorber be at @xmath114  cm , i.e. , smaller than the inner radius of the accretion disk .",
    "while the accretion curtain is a source of absorption at this close distance to the white dwarf , this absorption should be visible only on the white dwarf period and not on the binary period .",
    "we thus conclude that the white dwarf in ex  hya  is not luminous enough to ionize the absorber by photoionization processes alone .",
    "we can solve the problems with the pi model described above by imposing a base temperature to the absorber of order @xmath115  k. this ensures that no and and almost no is present in the absorber , as is required by the ionization balances found by the ci and pi models .",
    "this is crucial , since even small traces of these ions result in large amounts of absorption in the _ euve _ waveband . since this base temperature is significantly higher than the temperature of the outer disk ( 30007000  k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we conclude that viscous heating alone is insufficient to keep the absorber hot .",
    "other sources of heat , such as shocks due to the interaction between the accretion stream and the accretion disk , are needed .",
    "as shown above , the dominant source of ionizing radiation in ex  hya , the white dwarf and accretion columns , are not sufficiently luminous to ionize the accretion disk bulge by photoionization alone .",
    "therefore , the bulge must be ionized through a different process and , assuming that it is in , or close to , ci equilibrium , its temperature is of order @xmath116 or @xmath117  k. furthermore , to reproduce the shift of  with wavelength , the bulge must have a temperature gradient that steadily decreases from @xmath118 at @xmath119 to @xmath120 at @xmath121 .",
    "we speculate that this temperature gradient is caused by the interaction , e.g. , shocks , between the stream of accreting material from the companion and the accretion disk .    our simple analysis in   3.4 places the location of this interaction region on the disk at @xmath122 0.61.0 corresponding to a range of angles of approximately @xmath123@xmath124 from the line joining the two stars .",
    "the location and shape of the absorber is uncertain because we measure only the column density along the line of sight , although figure  4 shows two possibilities that are consistent with our data . in interpreting this figure ,",
    "it must be kept in mind that what we are seeing in the x - ray and euv wavelength bands is only that portion of the accretion bulge that rises an angle of @xmath125 above the orbital plane .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of close binary systems show that the inflowing material from the companion star forms a spiral - like structure in the accretion disk instead of the canonical hot spot on the edge of the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the location of such spiral structures appears to coincide with the position of the ex  hya  absorber .",
    "furthermore , simulations show that shocks occur in regions where the inflowing material interacts with the accretion disk",
    ". these shocks might be responsible for the heating needed in our ex  hya  absorber model .",
    "unfortunately , most of the hydrodynamic simulations do not include the effects of heating and cooling on the accretion disk structure ( but see , * ? ? ?",
    "the ex  hya  results presented in this paper provide an excellent constraint for new hydrodynamic simulations of close binary systems .    a hot absorber like the one in ex  hya  will generate its own emission , mainly in the uv band , the strength of which is given by the emission measure .",
    "unfortunately , we know only the column density and temperature along a slice through the absorber .",
    "it is unknown what the total volume of the absorber is and whether the temperature distribution is similar throughout the absorber .",
    "furthermore , the emission measure depends on the density of the absorber , which is also an unknown .",
    "estimates and assumptions for all these quantities can be made , but the result will be highly unreliable . to our knowledge there is no mention in the literature that the absorber has ever been observed in emission .",
    "we do however , see evidence of the absorber in _ orfeus ii _ data @xcite and , more clearly , in _ fuse _ data , for which the analysis is in progress , as line absorption features of the @xmath126 doublet lines and the @xmath127 , @xmath128 lines at binary phases @xmath129 .",
    "the absorption features are not visible at other binary phases .",
    "this range of binary phases agrees well with the absorber described in this paper .",
    "furthermore , the fact the shows line absorption confirms that the absorber contains highly ionized oxygen .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] shows that both the ci and pi model fits do not perform very well in the 15    band and the 510    band : both models tend to underpredict the amount of absorption .",
    "we found that adding a second absorber to our model improves the fit : it lowers the reduced @xmath130 from @xmath131 to @xmath132 ( see bottom panel fig .  [ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "the second absorber was modeled with a gaussian for the column density and a single temperature or ionization parameter .",
    "the results are that this absorber needs to be highly ionized [ @xmath133 or @xmath134 and have a large column @xmath135 . using similar arguments as in ",
    "3.4 we can constrain the position of the absorber , in the pi case , to be very close ( @xmath136  cm ) to the source of the ionizing emission , i.e. , basically at the shock front .",
    "it is hard to understand why this feature would appear on the binary period rather than the white dwarf period .",
    "if real , the second absorber is most likely to be near the inner edge of the accretion disk , somehow uncoupled to the magnetic field of the white dwarf . a long observation of ex  hya  could confirm the existence of a second absorber and perhaps better constrain its location .",
    "we report a new feature in the binary light curves of the magnetic cataclysmic variable ex  hya . based on _ chandra _",
    "hetg and _ euve _  ds data we have shown that the phase of the minimum in the broad modulation , associated with the bulge or hot spot on the accretion disk , increases with wavelength .",
    "collisional ionization and photoionization models explain this characteristic as a change in ionization state of the bulge plasma with binary phase .",
    "however , the ionizing radiation originating on the white dwarf and its accretion columns is insufficient to account for the ionization state of the bulge .",
    "moreover , the required ionization state also excludes viscous heating in the accretion disk as the main source of ionization .",
    "we thus conclude that the bulge plasma is heated by shocks resulting from the interaction between the inflowing material from the companion and the accretion disk .",

    "<S> we discuss several scenarios that could account for this trend and conclude that , most likely , the ionization state of the bulge gas is not constant , but rather decreases with binary phase . </S>",
    "<S> we also conclude that photoionization of the bulge by radiation originating from the white dwarf is not the main source of ionization , but that it is heated by shocks originating from the interaction between the inflowing material from the companion and the accretion disk . the findings in this paper </S>",
