    "particle physics experiments at the highest possible energies , with their unique ability to explore the uncharted territory at the energy frontier , provide exciting opportunities for great advances . for the past two decades",
    "hadron colliders , the cern @xmath1 collider and the fermilab tevatron , have held the high energy frontier and have resulted in the discovery of the @xmath2 and @xmath3-bosons , and the top quark . for at least the next half - decade , the tevatron will continue discovery physics experiments at the energy frontier and in a few years ( @xmath4 ) , the lhc will become the highest energy accelerator by colliding proton beams at a center of mass energy of @xmath5  tev .",
    "the lhc will provide excellent chances to discover the higgs boson and new physics at the tev scale . with the construction of the lhc and its detectors",
    "well under way , and in view of the substantial time needed for planning and construction of large scale high energy physics projects , it is timely to consider possibilities for upgrading the lhc and for constructing a new hadron collider capable of reaching energies of @xmath6  tev ) .",
    "such a machine should be viewed as post lhc and linear collider ( lc ) and would allow access to unprecedented energy scales breaking completely new ground .    for the lhc both a luminosity upgrade by a factor  10 to @xmath7 and an energy upgrade by a factor  2 to @xmath8  tev are being discussed ( so - called superlhc ( slhc ) ) .",
    "doubling the center of mass energy of the lhc would require new magnets with a field strength of about 17  t. such magnets currently do not exist .",
    "in contrast , a gradual increase of the luminosity by up to a factor  10 by increasing the bunch intensity to the beam  beam limit , replacing the quadrupole magnets near the interaction point , and reducing the bunch spacing by a factor  2 to 12.5  ns appears to be technologically feasible and , if so , can probably be achieved within 5  years after the lhc begins operation . from the experimental point of view ,",
    "an increase in the center of mass energy is easier to exploit than an increase in luminosity . even with major upgrades ,",
    "the performance of the lhc detectors atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite will be degraded at @xmath9 , due to the increased occupancy , radiation and pile - up noise .",
    "the impact of both possibilities on the physics capabilities of the atlas detector are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an example of a design study for a very large hadron collider ( vlhc ) capable of reaching energies of @xmath6  tev ) has recently been presented in ref .",
    "the design discusses a representative two stage @xmath10 collider .",
    "both stages might be housed in a tunnel with a total circumference of 233  km .",
    "the first phase ( vlhc - i ) would use 2  t super - ferric magnets in order to achieve a total center of mass energy of @xmath11  tev and a luminosity of @xmath12 . if the technology of super - ferric magnets can be pushed to 3  t as anticipated  @xcite , the center of mass energy of the vlhc - i could be increased to about 50  tev .",
    "stage  2 of the vlhc ( vlhc - ii ) would make use of the vlhc - i ring as an injector and could reach energies between 125  tev and 200  tev , depending on the field strength of the magnets  @xcite .",
    "the luminosity for @xmath13  tev would be of order @xmath14 , and would gradually decrease to approximately @xmath15 at @xmath16  tev . at vlhc - i ,",
    "the number of interactions per bunch crossing would be similar to that at the lhc ( @xmath17 ) . at vlhc - ii",
    ", one would expect between  50 and  100 interactions per bunch crossing , depending of the center of mass energy .",
    "luminosities up to @xmath7 at the highest center of mass energies considered are possible if the heat generated by synchrotron radiation  @xcite can be efficiently removed .",
    "furthermore , the design can be modified to a single stage machine with @xmath18  tev . in that scenario ,",
    "a separate 5  tev injector would be built in a new 15  km circumference tunnel , which could also house a gigaz @xmath19 collider  @xcite .    in order to reach a center of mass energy of 200  tev in the vlhc tunnel , superconducting high field magnets with a field strength of about 11  t",
    "would be necessary .",
    "such magnets could in principle also be installed in the tevatron tunnel , or a site  filling tunnel at fermilab , raising the possibility of a @xmath1 collider with a luminosity of @xmath20 and a center of mass energy of @xmath21  tev and 12  tev , respectively .",
    "studies have shown  @xcite that such a machine has a discovery potential for the higgs boson and supersymmetry which is similar to that of the lhc .",
    "however , it would be very difficult to complete such a project before 2010 , approximately 4  years after the lhc will commence operation .    with the tevatron now running and the lhc on the horizon ,",
    "it is appropriate to think ahead  to begin the investigation of the physics potential of and the detector requirements for hadron colliders with center of mass energies reaching the 100  tev region and/or luminosities which are up to a factor  10 larger than the lhc design luminosity . in this report",
    "we explore both aspects for a generic very large hadron collider ( vlhc ) , selecting    * @xmath11  tev ( vlhc - i ) , * @xmath22  tev ( vlhc - ii , low energy ) , and * @xmath16  tev ( vlhc - ii , high energy )    as reference energies .",
    "results will be presented for integrated luminosities in the range of 100  fb@xmath23 to 1  ab@xmath23 .",
    "whenever possible , we compare the physics reach of a vlhc with that of the slhc .",
    "we shall assume that the vlhc is a @xmath10 collider .",
    "for a given center of mass energy , the production cross section for a particle of mass @xmath24 in @xmath10 and @xmath1 collisions is very similar due to the large sea ",
    "sea quark flux .",
    "the valence quark  anti - quark flux only contributes measurably to the cross section for @xmath25 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] for a heavy @xmath2 boson with standard model ( sm ) like couplings .",
    "since the luminosity of a @xmath1 collider is estimated to be about a factor  10 smaller than that of a @xmath10 collider with the same center of mass energy , we shall only consider @xmath10 collisions in the following .",
    "boson with sm like couplings in @xmath10 and @xmath1 collisions as a function of the center of mass energy . for each value of @xmath26 ,",
    "the upper ( thin ) line gives the cross section for @xmath27 , while the lower ( thick ) line shows the cross section @xmath28 . ]    the remainder of this report is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : two ] we consider in some detail the physics opportunities at a vlhc .",
    "we discuss precision higgs boson physics , the search for supersymmetry , and aspects of strong electroweak symmetry breaking relevant for future hadron colliders .",
    "we also discuss the search reach for new gauge bosons , compositeness of quarks and leptons , and extra dimensions . for completeness",
    ", we also give results for selected sm cross sections . at the lhc and a linear @xmath19 collider ,",
    "the search for the higgs boson and precision higgs boson physics provide well - motivated , specific `` physics cases '' .",
    "not surprisingly , this is not the case for a vlhc .",
    "since such a machine will explore _ terra incognita _ , we can speculate about the physics to be discovered with such a facility , but can not at present make the case that a particular discovery is likely to occur . in section",
    "[ sec : three ] we discuss the detector requirements for a vlhc and outline a r&d program necessary in order to achieve the detector performance needed .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : four ] , we summarize our results and discuss future perspectives .",
    "in this section , we explore the physics opportunities at a vlhc .",
    "all results reported here are preliminary and represent only first steps towards a more complete analysis of the physics capabilities of such a machine . as noted above , a vlhc will come after at least two discovery machines ( tevatron and lhc ) will have had considerable experience .",
    "we expect that the physics panorama will be different from what we face today",
    ". therefore , it is important to note that the various scenarios considered often serve as place - holders for the physics menu of 15  20 years from now . we can be confident that pathways to this new physics will still pass through the need to be able to measure jets , leptons , photons and missing energy and have to function within radiation and rate environments which can be reliably predicted .",
    "however , the physics reactions chosen primarily act as illustrations of capabilities and indications of challenges which might be faced .",
    "they do not pretend to function as 2001 justifications for a 20 ? ?",
    "vlhc or slhc machine . the lead - time for design and construction will possibly prevent us from working within a realm of confident prediction of specific physics predictions",
    "whenever appropriate we compare the physics reach of the vlhc with that of the slhc and that of linear @xmath19 colliders under consideration , such as tesla  @xcite , the nlc  @xcite , the jlc  @xcite ( @xmath29  gev , @xmath30 ) , or clic @xmath31  tev , @xmath32  @xcite .      by the time a vlhc - i would begin operation those parameters of the sm which are currently not well constrained , such as the top quark mass , @xmath33 ,",
    "the higgs boson mass , @xmath34 , or the gauge boson self - interactions , should be known very accurately from data collected at the lhc and/or a linear @xmath19 collider .",
    "the reason for building a vlhc therefore is _ not _ to test the sm but to directly search for new physics .",
    "however , many sm processes , such as top quark production , weak boson or weak boson pair production , are important sources of backgrounds for new physics processes",
    ". accurate knowledge of the cross sections for sm processes , including higher order qcd and electroweak corrections is necessary .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] we show expected event rates for an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath23 for selected sm processes as a function of @xmath35 , taking into account minimal acceptance cuts listed on the figures for the observed final state particles .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      tracking using gaseous drift cells larger than about 1  cm",
    "is too slow for the central tracker , but would be acceptable for the muon system .",
    "all silicon central tracking is an option , with strips or ministrips ( e.g. 50  @xmath36  mm ) or pixels of the pad variety or columns .",
    "we consider up to @xmath37 elements ( 40  layers about 4  m long out to 2  m radius ) . in the column or 3d geometry electric field lines",
    "end on cylinders with axes normal to the detector plane , so the drift is transverse to the particle direction .",
    "one can then have short collection distances and times ( most of the signal is induced when the charge is close to the electrode , where the electrode solid angle is large ) so the 3d signals are concentrated in time .",
    "keys to the technology are being able to etch deep , near vertical holes and coat them with polysilicon .",
    "the first 3d detectors have been successfully fabricated .",
    "there is a wide plateau and calculations indicate a pulse duration of about 1  ns .",
    "r&d on these column detectors includes developing techniques for fabricating large areas , minimizing the amount of material for multilayer trackers , and studies of radiation hardness .      both electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters are essential for measuring electrons , photons and jets .",
    "one requires radiation hardness , high granularity , and speed .",
    "the different technology choices with their advantages and disadvantages should be clearly spelled out following on experience at run  iib and lhc .",
    "scintillator read out with embedded wavelength - shifting fibers to a light detector ( pmt , apd , hpd ) is a well - established technique which may be considered especially for the central region .",
    "lead tungstate pbwo@xmath38 or other crystals make a good electromagnetic calorimeter but compromise the jet resolution .",
    "quartz fibers embedded in ( e.g. ) cu gives a low ( cerenkov ) signal but are very radiation hard .",
    "silicon pads make a compact calorimeter but radiation hardness is an issue .",
    "( cvd ) diamond pads should be radiation hard enough but at present the cost would be prohibitive .",
    "this is a clear r&d issue : to bring down the cost of diamond films so that they can be realistically considered for forward ( if not central ) calorimetry .",
    "high pressure gas calorimetry is cheap , radiation hard and promising , especially for the forward direction .",
    "liquid argon is intrinsically slow ( compared to 18  ns ) but with signal shaping and leading - edge recognition has been shown to be robust in a relatively high rate environment .",
    "a particularly interesting new idea is to use unsegmented dual read - out calorimetry . in this concept ,",
    "longitudinal quartz fibers , which see mostly the electromagnetic shower , and scintillating fibers , which see mostly the hadronic shower , are embedded in a metal absorber matrix .",
    "this can achieve the essential advantages of compensating calorimetry , eliminating the effect of fluctuations in @xmath39 .",
    "the sampling fraction could be as large as needed for optimizing the em response , and the hadronic resolution would not suffer .",
    "it is an important r&d project to construct and test such a dual readout calorimeter .",
    "muons are important for @xmath40 and @xmath41-physics as well as knowing the missing @xmath42 , @xmath43 . because of multiple scattering and energy loss fluctuations in the calorimeter ,",
    "it is best to measure the muon momentum before the calorimeter , and use the track behind the calorimeter to identify the muon .",
    "there are large fluctuations ( @xmath44  gev ) in @xmath45 for a 1  tev muon  @xcite .",
    "a goal is to measure the sign of @xmath46  tev muons with a combination of field integral ( 8  tm ) , number of points ( @xmath47 ) , and precision per point ( 50  @xmath48 m ) .",
    "the tracking outside the calorimeter , which is very large in area , can then be relaxed .",
    "when muons are isolated one can and should measure any showering losses along their tracks , as these are significant .      in order to make optimal use of the enormous center of mass energy of a vlhc , hadron calorimeter coverage out to @xmath49 and luminosities in the range @xmath50 are necessary . at the upper end of this range ,",
    "numerous technological challenges are present for almost all detector components . from the very preliminary survey  @xcite",
    "described here , one can begin to form tentative conclusions which should lead to specific r&d efforts .",
    "these tentative conclusions are :    1 .",
    "early indications suggest that with existing and anticipated technologies , tracking may be manageable at the necessary level . however , a significant amount of r&d directed towards radiation hard , precise and fast approaches ( e.g. silicon pads , 3d pixels ) is necessary to conclusively answer this question .",
    "2 .   it may be possible to identify , sign , and momentum analyze muons at the necessary level for all luminosities .",
    "the main issue is the momentum resolution for muons with momenta larger than 1  tev .",
    "this needs to be looked at in detail in the context of punch - through and backgrounds .",
    "central calorimetry will likely survive the anticipated radiation doses .",
    "however , the large number of interactions per crossing will make jet identification and the measurement of missing transverse momentum difficult , even in the multi hundred gev region .",
    "the alternative of extremely short bunch spacing represents major challenges for triggering and data acquisition .",
    "4 .   in the forward region , which is important for jet tagging in wbf events ,",
    "radiation hardness is a major issue . here ,",
    "a large scale r&d effort directed towards quartz fibers , scintillating fibers and silicon / diamond pads is needed in order to see to what rapidities the hadron calorimeter can be extended .",
    "a general conclusion reached was that if lhc detectors function as expected at @xmath51 then scaled detectors with atlas / cms technologies would also work at vlhc - i ( @xmath52  tev ) at the same luminosity .",
    "in an important sense the major r&d for vlhc detectors is the construction and successful use of lhc detectors atlas and cms .",
    "if the lhc detectors were scaled up a factor  1.4 linearly ( 2.7 in volume ) that would be a fair starting point for a vlhc - ii at @xmath53 .",
    "but for all detectors we need more radiation hard technology , we need more precision / granularity , and we generally need them to be faster .",
    "these are the areas of r&d needed , together with finding ways of making the detectors cheaper .",
    "it is not unreasonable to suppose that we have some 10  years ( until @xmath54 ) for the r&d and then one will have 10  years to build the detectors , for operation @xmath55 .",
    "in this report we have presented preliminary results of a survey of the physics capabilities of a hadron collider operating in the 100  tev region .",
    "we have also studied the detector requirements so that the physics goals can be achieved .",
    "if the higgs boson is light ( @xmath56  gev ) , as indicated by present precision electroweak data , a lc will be an ideal tool to precisely study the properties of such a particle .",
    "no such `` gold plated '' physics case exists at this point for a vlhc .",
    "however , although the lhc has excellent prospects of making fundamental discoveries beyond the sm , it is unlikely to provide complete answers to all ensuing questions .",
    "it is easy to construct scenarios where a convincing reason for building a vlhc emerges . in the following we list some which directly follow from the topics discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : two ] .    *",
    "the tevatron and/or lhc / slhc finds a higgs boson and nothing else .",
    "a lc will then measure most of the higgs boson properties if @xmath34 is sufficiently small .",
    "the vlhc would extend those measurements and be the only device capable of searching for the necessary next scale . *",
    "the tevatron and/or lhc / slhc finds a light higgs boson consistent with a supersymmetric interpretation and nothing else .",
    "this could happen for certain points in parameter space of msugra models . in this case",
    "the first stage of the vlhc would find supersymmetry .",
    "* the lhc / slhc finds some supersymmetric particles , but no squarks associated with the first two generations .",
    "this situation could easily happen in inverted mass hierarchy models .",
    "the vlhc would then find the missing squarks and give important hints which model is realized in nature . *",
    "the lhc / slhc finds supersymmetry and determines that the messenger scale is of @xmath57  tev ) . in this case , the messenger fields which communicate supersymmetry breaking would be directly produced at the vlhc . * the lhc / slhc does not find anything except for a weak indication of an enhanced rate in vector boson scattering at the highest accessible energies .",
    "this could happen in certain models where the electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically , such as the k - matrix unitarization scheme .",
    "vlhc - i would see a clear signal . *",
    "the lhc / slhc finds evidence for contact interactions with a scale @xmath58  tev .",
    "the vlhc would then be able to directly probe the scale of new physics , eg .",
    "in composite models of quarks and leptons , excited quarks would be produced .",
    "for such measurements , vlhc - i , ii are the obvious devices to exploit that finding . *",
    "the lhc / slhc finds kk excitations of gravitons and/or the sm gauge bosons . in this case",
    "the vlhc could perform detailed measurements of the excitation spectrum .",
    "this would make it possible to determine how the additional spatial dimensions associated with the kk excitations are warped or compactified . *",
    "if the lhc / slhc finds evidence for extra dimensions , the vlhc may well operate sufficiently far above the ( higher dimensional ) planck scale such that black holes are produced .",
    "bh production would make it possible to actually measure the number of extra dimensions .    in all cases information obtained at the lhc / slhc",
    "gives important clues on what physics lies beyond the sm .",
    "however , it is not necessary to wait for results from the lhc in order to start planning for a vlhc now . at some point one ,",
    "inevitably , will want to explore the multi 10  tev region .",
    "a hadron collider is the only machine we in principal know how to build which can directly discover new physics in this region . with the long lead time for a large project like a hadron collider it is essential to start this process now .",
    "furthermore , this must be done as part of a coordinated and coherent international plan which is part of a comprehensive and global high energy physics program .    at this workshop",
    "we have begun to investigate the physics potential of a very large hadron collider with a center of mass energy up to 200  tev .",
    "we have also identified several important areas of detector r&d for such a machine . in the three weeks",
    "available we have barely scratched the surface of many topics .",
    "more serious and detailed studies in the next several years are essential to fully unravel the potential of a vlhc .",

    "<S> we discuss the physics opportunities and detector challenges at future hadron colliders . as guidelines for energies and luminosities we use the proposed luminosity and/or energy upgrade of the lhc ( slhc ) , and the fermilab design of a very large hadron collider ( vlhc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the physics capabilities of future hadron colliders for a variety of new physics scenarios ( supersymmetry , strong electroweak symmetry breaking , new gauge bosons , compositeness and extra dimensions ) . we also investigate the prospects of doing precision higgs physics studies at such a machine , and list selected standard model physics rates .    </S>",
