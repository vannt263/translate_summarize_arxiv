    "here we use nebulae from this larger sample to study the metallicity distribution in the milky way .",
    "since the measurement uncertainty in deriving the hii  region electron temperature from single - dish radio data is dominated by continuum measurements , we first performed a continuum survey of 143 hrds nebulae to select the best sources .",
    "we chose the relatively unexplored galactic azimuth range between @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2@xmath1 .",
    "the continuum observations were made in excellent weather conditions using the gbt dynamic scheduling system ( see below for details about continuum observations ) .",
    "we select 21 of the best continuum sources based on the following criteria .",
    "( 1 ) sources having a continuum intensity signal - to - noise ratio greater than 10 . ( 2 ) since we are probing trans - galactic paths , source confusion can be a significant problem .",
    "we chose sources where the hii  region was either isolated or where any blending of components could be well - fit by gaussian profiles .",
    "( 3 ) we select sources with either flat rrl spectral baselines or with baseline structure that could be well - fit by a low order polynomial function . ( 4 ) since we seek to explore metallicity structure , we chose sources that span a wide range of galactic radii over the specified azimuth range .",
    "these hrds sources are shown as red circles in figure  [ fig : dist ] .",
    "hereafter , all the hii  regions shown in figure  [ fig : dist ] will be called the green bank sample .",
    "the green bank sample contains 90 nebulae with accurate electron temperatures .",
    "we used the gbt to observe the rrl and continuum emission toward the 21 hrds hii  regions in the sample that did not yet have data of sufficient quality to derive their metallicities .",
    "the observations spanned 10 distinct observing sessions between 2011 march 25 and 2012 april 24 .",
    "the observing procedures and data reduction were similar to that of @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe them below .",
    "total power , position - switched spectra were taken with the gbt auto - correlation spectrometer ( acs ) .",
    "we first observed a reference ( off ) position for 6 minutes and then , tracking the same sky path , observed the target position ( on ) for 6 minutes , for a total time of 12 minutes .",
    "the acs was tuned to 8 distinct frequencies , each with a bandwidth of 50@xmath13 .",
    "since the x - band receiver samples two orthogonal circular polarizations , each total power pair contains 16 independent spectra .",
    "the 8 spectral windows included seven hn@xmath10 rrls ( 87 - 93 ) covering 8 - 10@xmath14  with half - power beam - widths ( hpbws ) from 73 to 90 arcsec .",
    "there are eight hn@xmath10 rrls within the x - band receiver , but the 86  rrl is confused with higher order rrls .",
    "therefore , we tuned the last spectral window to the h114@xmath15 and h130@xmath16 rrls .",
    "the center rest frequencies include : 8045.6 , 8300.0 , 8584.8 , 8665.3 , 8877.0 , 9183.0 , 9505.0 , and 9812.0 mhz .",
    "we made continuum observations at two circular orthogonal polarizations with the digital continuum receiver ( dcr ) at a frequency of 8556@xmath13 , near the 91  rrl , with a bandwidth of 320@xmath13 .",
    "we scanned the telescope at a rate of @xmath17 in r.a .",
    "and then in decl . for 60s .",
    "the data were sampled by the dcr at 0.1s .",
    "we performed offset pointing and focus observations on a calibrator every two hours to ensure that we were centered on the hii  region .",
    "each continuum scan is twice the size of that used in @xcite to better establish the zero level in these directions with more complex continuum emission structure .",
    "the line - to - continuum ratio is used to derive the electron temperature .",
    "therefore , we observed the continuum before each set of spectral line observations for each source so that fluctuations in the weather or telescope gain between the continuum and spectral line observations would be minimized .",
    "we reduced and analyzed the rrl and continuum data following the procedures in @xcite .",
    "six hn@xmath10 spectra were averaged to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the 90  rrl was not included because a nearby , higher order rrl effected the baseline fit .",
    "we re - sampled the velocity scale to that of the 87  rrl , and shifted all spectra to match the doppler tracked 89  rrl .",
    "since the gbt s beam varies by 20% across the x - band receiver , we assume gaussian source brightness distributions and hpbws to scale the rrl intensities to the 91  rrl ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the electron temperature depends on the line - to - continuum ratio , therefore , in principle , we only require a relative intensity calibration .",
    "this is not true here since we have only measured the continuum at one frequency , near the 91  rrl . following @xcite",
    "we calculate an average rrl intensity relative to the 91  line .",
    "the continuum data were taken at 8665@xmath13  over a bandwidth that includes the 91  transition , so we calibrated the hn@xmath10 lines relative to the 91  line .",
    "in figure  [ fig : ta ] , we plot the ratio of the interpolated 91  intensity ( ih91 ) and the average rrl intensity ( ah91 ) , scaled to the 91  frequency as discussed above , for all 21 hrds sources .",
    "the ih91/ah91 ratios are @xmath18 for ll and @xmath19 for rr .",
    "the ratios are offset by less than 5 - 10% from unity and are caused by errors in the noise tube calibration ( @xmath20 ) and any systematic errors in our data reduction .",
    "the dispersion in ih91/ah91 may be caused by several factors that include systematic errors in the spectral baseline fits , random noise , elevation gain fluctuations , weather fluctuations , etc .",
    "the dispersion here is three times larger than in @xcite because the sources are weaker by more than a factor of 5 .",
    "nevertheless , we deem that the line - to - continuum calibration scale is accurate to within @xmath21% . using these procedures we calculated and applied corrections factors of @xmath22 for ll and @xmath23 for rr .    comparing the rrl intensity for each polarization",
    "provides an additional check on our calibration .",
    "we derive polarization ratios of @xmath24 and @xmath25 for ih91 and ah91 , respectively using all 21 hrds sources ( see figure  [ fig : pol ] ) .",
    "these ratios are less than the expected @xmath20 uncertainties of about 10% .",
    "moreover , the dispersion in the distribution from ih91 to ah91 decreases as @xmath26 as expected for random gaussian noise .",
    "we used the idl single - dish software package tmbidl , written by our team , to analyze these data .",
    "the spectral line parameters were determined by first fitting the spectral baseline with a third - order polynomial , which was subtracted from the data , and then fitting gaussian functions to the h , he , and c rrls .",
    "three parameters were derived for each rrl : the peak antenna temperature , the fwhm line width , and the local standard of rest ( lsr )  toward ( @xmath10 , @xmath27 ) = ( @xmath28 , @xmath29@xmath1 ) [ 1900.0 ] @xcite . ] velocity center .",
    "the continuum parameters were determined by first removing the background zero - level with a third - order polynomial and then using gaussian functions to model the peak continuum intensity and the fwhm angular source size .",
    "here we use radio observations of hii  regions to determine the metallicity structure of the milky way disk .",
    "accurate measurement of the line - to - continuum ratio is necessary to derive the electron ( thermal ) temperature .",
    "metals such as oxygen and nitrogen are the primary coolants in hii  regions and are well correlated with electron temperature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore we use the derived electron temperatures as a proxy for metallicity .",
    "hiiregion locations are determined from the lsr velocity and a model of the rotation of the galactic disk .",
    "together these provide the information necessary to produce a map of the metallicity distribution in the galactic disk .",
    "table  [ tab : line ] summarizes the rrl measurements for our 21 hiiregion sample .",
    "listed are the source name , the element , gaussian fit parameters , the total integration time , the root - mean - square ( rms ) spectral noise , and the quality factor ( hereafter qf ; see below ) .",
    "the gaussian fits include the peak intensity , the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) line width , and the lsr velocity with their associated errors .",

    "directions relative to the nominal source position .",
    "the qf is a qualitative assessment of the line and continuum measurement where `` a '' is excellent and `` d '' is poor .",
    "baseline structure and confusion are difficult to quantify and thus visual inspection is used to assess the quality of line and continuum data . since the gbt rrl baselines are excellent with little line confusion at x - band , we follow @xcite and calculate the qf for the line data using the signal - to - noise ratio and the percent error of the gaussian fit of the line area . for the continuum data the qf includes a visual assessment of the baseline structure , source confusion , the consistency of the peak intensity between the r.a . and decl . scans , and the repeatability between the forward and backward scans .",
    "there are no qf = a sources for the rrl data since the signal - to - noise ratio is not sufficient for these more distant , weaker sources .",
    "since our sample was selected based on the quality of the continuum data there are no qf = d sources for the continuum data .    to better assess the level of source confusion we made crude 8.7@xmath14continuum images for each hii  region .",

    "but there are examples where the more accurate direct method , involving the [ o iii]@xmath1044363 auroral line , was used to derive the [ o / h ] abundance ratio and the flattening persists ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "explanations for the flattening include variations in gas density , the presence of a bar ( e.g. , radial migration ) , the corotation resonance ( the radius where the rotation speed of the spiral arm equals that of the material in the disk ) , and mergers .",
    "@xcite measured the oxygen abundance radial gradient in the disks of 306 galaxies using hii  regions .",
    "they find a slope that is independent of morphology , the presence of bars , absolute magnitude , or mass ; but the gradient is flatter for interacting galaxies .",
    "most galaxies with sufficient data indicate a flattening of the gradient beyond two effective radii .",

    "they find a correlation between the corotation radius and the radius where there exists a metallicity break in the radial gradient for most galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , the empirical evidence for any radial break in the metallicity is not clear in the milky way .",

    "but when the more accurate direct method is used to derive the [ o / h ] abundance ratio , non - radial metallicity structure is not detected : m31 @xcite , m33 @xcite , and m101 @xcite . unlike the milky way these galaxies do not contain a bar .",
    "galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) models have become more complex over the last decade .",
    "early gce models divided the disk into annuli with no radial exchange of material , and typically employed a schmidt - kennicutt star formation law that included infalling gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these models can generally reproduce the observed radial metallicity gradient but they include free parameters that can be tuned to match the observations .",
    "it has been known for many years that non - axisymmetric forces , such as spiral arms , can change the angular momentum of stars in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the dominant effect of spiral arms is the resonant scattering of stars located at corotation ; stars can therefore migrate radially while maintaining a circular orbit .",
    "chemodynamical models consider both the chemical and dynamical evolution of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they produce radial metallicity gradients that are within the range observed , but , as discussed above , the derived gradient slopes vary by a factor of three between the different studies and is therefore not well constrained . @xcite considered the chemical evolution of both the stars and gas in a bar dominated disk galaxy .",
    "there are no azimuthal variations in either the stars or gas at early times , but at late times ( 10@xmath107 ) the corotation of the bar moves outward allowing metal poor gas to flow inward creating azimuthal variations up to a factor of two in the gas in the outer regions ( @xmath55= 12@xmath46 ) .",
    "this may explain the lower radial metallicity gradients we observe in the direction of the bar .",
    "since most of the stars have already been formed at all radii before radial gas flows are induced by the bar , stars show little azimuthal metallicity structure in these simulations ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with metallicity measurements of red clump stars in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "one caveat is that these simulations do not include infall , which could also create azimuthal variations .",
    "we measure the rrl and continuum emission with the gbt toward 21 galactic hii  regions between galactic azimuth @xmath108@xmath1  at x - band ( @xmath109@xmath14 ) .",
    "we derive electron temperatures from the line - to - continuum ratio assuming lte , and use the @xmath34[o / h ] calibration from @xcite to determine the metallicity .",
    "we combine these results with our previous efforts using the nrao 140 foot @xcite and gbt @xcite to produce a high quality sample of 90 sources over @xmath110@xmath1 , spanning galactic radii @xmath55  = @xmath111@xmath46 .",
    "we find radial metallicity gradients , [ o / h ] vs @xmath55 , between @xmath112 and @xmath113@xmath4  depending on the azimuth range sampled .",
    "we see no evidence for a break or flattening of the radial gradient near @xmath55= 10@xmath46 .",
    "we confirm the azimuthal metallicity structure detected by @xcite between @xmath114@xmath1 , but the magnitude of the metallicity variations is reduced by 25% .",
    "monte carlo simulations , however , indicate that the azimuthal metallicity structure in this azimuth zone is not statistically significant .",
    "nevertheless , the large variations in the [ o / h]@xmath55  slope , by almost a factor of two , between azimuth zone @xmath7@xmath1@xmath6@xmath1and @xmath115@xmath1@xmath2@xmath1  is significant .",
    "we suggest that the lower radial metallicity gradients over @xmath114@xmath1  may be the result of radial mixing from the bar .",

    "hii  regions are very young and probe metallicity at the current epoch ",
