    "we detected rotational co transitions from j@xmath25@xmath261421 and some water lines in both lobes .",
    "the co emission is on average 1.5 times stronger in the southern outflow lobe , suggesting a higher filling factor of the beam or a higher co abundance .",

    "the co - added fluxes of the 00s lines in the two lws apertures are given in table[flux ] .",
    "the two outflow lobes are also present in the co(32 ) map ( fig.[cepe_gray ] ) .",
    "note that the two lobes are elongated in a direction mis - aligned from the overall outflow direction . at the brightest points",
    ", the line shape shows signs of being optically thick ( self absorption and re - emission ) .",
    "high velocity bullets with v@xmath27100kms@xmath6 are also detected . in the cs(76 ) map we found weak emission only near the source position and extremely weak emission at the three brightest knots of the outflow ( s1 , na and nd ) .",
    "nevertheless , the outflow structure is visible in this line . at the three positions where the co(43 )",
    "line is observed we see the same line structure as for the co(32 ) line : optically thick in the line centre and very fast co bullets ( v@xmath27100kms@xmath6 ) .",
    "the northern positions observed in sio(87 ) show no sign of a line . only at the two positions in the south very weak emission",
    "is detected .",
    "to determine the luminosity and excitation of a deeply - embedded outflow it is necessary to remove the extinction .",
    "extinction reduces observed fluxes from their intrinsic values , especially for those from the shorter wavelength kspec data .",
    "hence , in order to test shock models , we first adjust the kspec fluxes .",
    "since the cepe outflow is embedded in the parental cloud of the source ( only the southernmost part is visible at optical wavelengths as hh377 ) , the extinction is high .",
    "moreover , the extinction may vary not only over the field of the lws aperture but also through a lobe .",
    "that is , the k - band data will be more representative of emission arising from low - excitation regions while iso and co data will sample more evenly . here",
    ", however , since we do not have an extinction map and can not distinguish components of contrasting extinction , we determine the extinction for each kspec location and then apply one value per lws and isocam beam .",
    "three means are at our disposal to estimate the extinction .",
    "first , 1.25 mm continuum emission from cool dust is spatially coincident with the outflow @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as an h column of 6  @xmath20  10@xmath28  cm in the lobe locations , corresponding to 34  mag of k - band extinction ( incorrectly converted by @xcite ) .",
    "if half of this emission lies on average in front of the lobe , an extinction of 1.52  mag would result .",
    "submillimeter continuum observations yield a mean h@xmath0 column of 3  @xmath20  10@xmath28 cm within a 30@xmath29 radius , consistent with the above result @xcite .",
    "second , the q - branch 10 lines beyond 2.4@xmath16 m arise from the same upper energy levels as the s - branch 10 lines within the k - band .",
    "hence , differential extinction between these wavelengths can , in theory , be determined exactly since the number of emitted photons must be proportional to their einstein coefficients ( radiative decay rates ) .",
    "absolute extinction can then be derived from the differential value provided the properties of the dust are known .    to apply this second method ,",
    "we adopt a differential extinction of the form @xmath30 . using just the 10s(1 ) and 10q(3 ) lines ( both originating from the same upper energy level ) , we determine k - band extinctions of a@xmath31 2.6 ",
    "3.2mag for the three kspec slit positions .",
    "in contrast , the q(2)/s(0 ) ratio yields a uniform extinction of just 1.1@xmath70.1  mag .",
    "the q - branch lines are , however , greatly effected by transmission and are often inaccurate .",
    "one good test for accuracy is to inspect the ratio of the q(3)/q(1 ) lines which should be within the range [ 0.91,1.12 ] if filter or transmission distortions are low and if the gas is excited within the range [ 1500k,3000k ] .",
    "this was not case for the previously derived values in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite find values of 0.58 and 0.86 for locations in the two lobes and @xcite find 0.78 and 0.88 .",
    "differential extinction would only exacerbates the inconsistency",
    ". here , we derive q - branch q(3)/q(1 ) ratios of 1.18 , 1.16 and 1.10 for the 3 slits , which are comfortably consistent when some differential extinction is taken into account .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case , extinctions derived from the s(1)/q(3 ) and s(0)/q(2 ) ratios do not agree .",
    "the third method also employs differential extinction but makes use of a large fraction of the data .",
    "we plot the h@xmath0 columns from all the levels across the h and k bands and then determine the extinction range which best correlates the accumulated data . to achieve this result , however , one must apply the normalised column density ratio ( cdr ) method . plotting the derived absolute columns of h@xmath0 , n@xmath32 against the upper energy level",
    ", e@xmath32 hides the information in the data since columns are spread out over three orders of magnitude while error bars are only 10% on many data points . in the cdr method ,",
    "the columns are normalised to the 10  s(1 ) flux and divided by the equivalent lte column of a gas at 2000k ( see @xcite and for details ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ extinction ] .",
    "[ extinction ] confirms that high extinction is present .",
    "extinction is responsible for the distribution of the data points along the edges of a rhombus ( top panels ) , which collapses to a line on applying the extinctions indicated .",
    "the four sides of the rhombus consist of ( i ) the k - band 10  s - branch , ( ii ) 10  q - branch , ( iii ) 21  s - branch and ( iv ) h - band 10  s - branch .",
    "we note no evidence for uv excitation and fluorescent emission ( as usually identifiable from rotational transitions within the higher vibrational levels ) .",
    "hence , the cdrs from the 21 lines should lie level or below those from the 10 lines .",
    "however , we also require that the q - branch lines are not too far below the s - branch lines . in this manner ,",
    "a good approximation for extinction is reached in each case .",
    "the higher k - band extinction in the northern lobe by @xmath5 0.7  mag implies that this lobe is _ not _ intrinsically weaker than the southern lobe in molecular hydrogen emission .",
    "the north - south 10 s(1 ) ratio was found by @xcite to be 0.54 .",
    "this suggests that the outflow may be much more symmetric than appears .",
    "since the northern lobe is redshifted , this is also consistent with the lobe dynamics within a spherical cloud .",
    "the mean density can be estimated on assuming the geometry of the enveloping cloud . taking a uniform spherical cloud of radius 30@xmath29 , corresponding to 0.11pc , and an average column to the outflow of @xmath33  cm@xmath22 ,",
    "yields a mean ( h nuclei ) density estimate of @xmath35 .",
    "the extinction also implies that the intrinsic h@xmath0 luminosity from the 10  s(1 ) line _ alone _ is 0.33  l@xmath4 , and the total h@xmath0 luminosity will probably lie in the range 39  l@xmath4 , depending on the type and strength of shock waves involved .",
    "notably , this total is very close to that estimated for the complete far - infrared cooling by @xcite of 2.8  l@xmath4 , which includes co , h@xmath0o , o and oh emission .",
    "planar shock models for cepe south .",
    "in addition to the symbols described in fig[extinction ] , the isocam data are represented by stars . * ( a ) * a hot c - shock component with 32kms@xmath6 provides a fit to the vibrationally - excited columns but does not contribute to the co rotational lines ( other critical parameters are a density of 10@xmath1  @xmath2 , an alfvn speed 1.5  km  s@xmath6 , ion fraction @xmath36 , a transverse magnetic field and n(h@xmath0)/(n(h)+2n(h@xmath0 ) )  =  0.3 ) .",

    "l  =  10@xmath49  cm emits 0.016  l@xmath4 in the h@xmath0 10  s(1 ) line .",
    "therefore , 20 such bows in each lobe would suffice to provide the observed luminosity .",
    "note that these bows would appear larger than l in size , with h@xmath0 being thermally dissociated until the normal component of velocity falls below 45  km  s@xmath6 . for a paraboloid , it is straightforward to show that this occurs at r  =  2.47  l and z  =  3.05  l.    a single j - type bow with s  =  1.5 , v@xmath48 = 60  km  s@xmath6 and scale size",
    "l  =  10@xmath49  cm emits 0.02  l@xmath4 .",
    "hence , 16 such bows would be needed to account for the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the apparent bow size is , however , larger . with a dissociation speed limit of 25  km  s@xmath6 , we find molecules survive only for bow locations at r  @xmath50  4.76  l and z  @xmath50  4.36  l.    the [ o i ] 63@xmath16 m line is potentially a good shock diagnostic . however , the column density of hydrogen nuclei which provides unit optical depth at line centre is just @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "this may explain why the model line flux is overpredicted by factors of a few ( see table[bowfluxes ] ) .",
    "given gas columns of @xmath52 , the observed [ oi ] emission may well not have a shock origin .",
    "furthermore , we also detected the [ cii](158@xmath16 m ) line in the lws spectrum .",
    "the measured ratio [ oi](63@xmath16m)/[cii](158@xmath16 m ) is about 1.3 ( 1.5 ) for the north and south lobes , respectively . in shocks ,",
    "the [ cii](158@xmath16 m ) line is usually several orders of magnitute fainter than the [ oi](63@xmath16 m ) @xcite .",
    "hence these lines may have a pdr origin , as already discussed by @xcite .",
    "the observed oh luminosity is , according to @xcite , to be treated with caution since it may well be due to continuum pumping .",
    "we conclude from table[bowfluxes ] that the long wings of the j - type bow produce extremely high fluxes in the lines from the cooler molecular gas .",
    "this is inconsistent with all expectations since the total cooling then exceeding the bolometric luminosity of the protostar .",
    "furthermore , in a shock - dissipative momentum - driven outflow , we expect the mechanical power of the flow to be very close to the total cooling .",
    "we estimate here the mechanical power through co j=21 observations by first noting that most of the emission is from low - speed co but most of the kinetic energy lies in the co moving with radial speeds of 1525  km  s@xmath6 ( a result of the very flat line profile found for cepheus e ) . hence , given a blue lobe mass of 0.16  m@xmath4 @xcite",
    ", we derive a mechanical energy of @xmath53  erg and a mechanical power @xmath54 .",
    "although this estimate is subject to considerable uncertainty , it is consistent with the c - type bow model .",
    "a further diagnostic is provided by the integrated intensity of the co(32 ) emission shown in fig.[cepe_gray ] .",
    "the c - bow model predicts a co(32)/co(1817 ) ratio of 6.0 in contrast to the j - bow model ( 276 ) for the southern outflow lobe . the measured ratio is 4 ( north ) and 2 ( south ) ,",
    "much nearer to the predictions of the c - type bow model .",
    "the columns in the 0 - 0  s(3 ) and 0 - 0  s(5 ) appear lower than predicted in the southern lobe .",
    "this suggest that the ortho - to - para ratio of h@xmath0 may be under three , the lte value for high temperatures .",
    "this can occur in c - shocks since the gas is gradually heated from a low pre - shock temperature .",
    "therefore , the gas maintains the pre - shock ortho - para ratio .",
    "after some heating , however , atomic hydrogen can induce ortho - para conversion .",
    "note that the distribution of shocks generated by a supersonic turbulent velocity field can produce an excitation that mimics that from a bow shock surface .",
    "it can be shown that a power law number distribution of shock speeds ( with power law index @xmath55 where @xmath56 ) is required .",
    "this also assumes that there is no systematic magnetic field effects although , for bow shocks with moderate alfvn speeds , we find that the magnetic field direction has an insignificant influence on the excitation .",
    "we have analysed the molecular outflow from the cepheuse - mm source over a broad wavelength range , from the near infrared into the sub - millimeter regime .",
    "we combined kspec nir data , iso mid- and far - infrared spectra and jcmt sub - mm observations .",
    "we have concentrated on the properties of the vibrationally and rotationally excited h@xmath0 and co since sufficient data points exist to permit a _",
    "simultaneously _ interpretation in terms of shock models using j- and c - type physics .",
    "we investigated planar and curved shocks .      1 .",
    "extinction is most accurately derived by satisfying multiple constraints on the complete nir data set rather than from specific line ratios .",
    "the southern blueshifted lobe has a mean k - band extinction of 1.4  mag and the northern redshifted lobe has extinction in the range 2.1  2.4  mag .",
    "this is consistent with the extinction being internal to a spherical cloud , with a density of 10@xmath1  @xmath2 and radius @xmath57 .",
    "remarkably , the extinction - corrected h@xmath0 columns , including the iso data , demonstrate a state close to local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "2 .   we interpret all the measured h@xmath0 and co line fluxes simultaneously in terms of shock models .",
    "the best fitting models are obtained using _ shock distributions _ in the form of bow shocks .",
    "c - type physics is strongly favoured mainly because j - type physics predicts extremely strong emission from the low - excitation flanks of a bow , which is not observed .",
    "moreover , for the j - shock model , the outflow power and momentum become implausibly large in comparison to the values found for the protostar and the bipolar outflow , respectively .",
    "4 .   high resolution h@xmath0 10",
    "s(1 ) imaging has shown that the lobes consist of numerous emission knots of size @xmath58  cm @xcite .",
    "we find that of order 20 such bow shocks , close to paraboloidal in shape , are required by the model to explain the intergrated emission for each lobe .",
    "no significant differences in the density or abundances are found between positions .",
    "we also find no significant differences in the h@xmath0 excitation when analysing the integrated spectra of a whole outflow lobe or a 6@xmath206 pixel - sized part .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite and suggests that the large bows are built up of smaller unresolved bow shocks , generated by flow instabilities .",
    "the pre - shock medium is not fully molecular in these models .",
    "we have found a mean atomic fraction of @xmath59 . with bow speeds of 120  km  s@xmath6 ,",
    "extensive bow apices are predicted within which molecules are completely destroyed .",
    "the reformation time is of order 10@xmath60/n@xmath61(h ) , where n@xmath61(h ) is the atomic density in the compressed layers .",
    "hence , a reformation time of @xmath5 3000  yr may be achieved for n@xmath61(h )  =  10@xmath62  @xmath2 .",
    "the total mass set into motion by the outflow is low , 0.25m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we estimate a total cloud mass of 5m@xmath3 given a density of 10@xmath1  @xmath2 and radius 2.2@xmath2010@xmath60  cm . with an outflow half - opening angle of @xmath12 , a fraction f@xmath61 = 1-cos@xmath12 of the cloud",
    "would be disturbed by two lobes .",
    "taking @xmath12  =  20@xmath11 , yields f@xmath61  =  0.06 , and thus provides a consistent basic model .",
    "high outflow powers have been uncovered from many other class 0 protostars .",
    "mechanical luminosity exceeds 50% of the bolometric luminosity for all of the perseus class 0 sources @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a few class 0 protostars such as l1527 and b335 possess relatively weak outflows as measured by total far - infrared luminosities @xcite and co momentum flow rates . in this respect ,",
    "the cepheus e outflow could represent a powerful but abrupt evolutionary phase , about to be brought to a halt as underlying jets exit a compact 0.1  pc cloud .",
