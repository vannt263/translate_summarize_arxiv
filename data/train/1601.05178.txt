    "however , recent findings from analysis of the supergranulation dynamics on the sun @xcite and helioseismology inversions @xcite put in question the results of the mean - field models predicting a single - cell meridional circulation structure of the solar convection zone . global 3d simulations of the flows in the solar convection zone also show the multiple - cell structure of the meridional circulation @xcite .    in this note",
    "we show that the double - cell meridional circulation structure can be compatible with the solar - like rotation law in the framework of the mean - field theory .",

    "this model has a slightly stronger latitudinal shear at the surface than model m1 .",
    "the amplitude of the meridional flows in model m3 is larger than in m2 .",
    "the flow speed reaches about 18 m / s at the surface and about 5 m / s at the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "model m3 qualitatively preserves the angular velocity profile of model m1 .",
    "we investigated the mean - field models of the solar differential rotation using a simple description of the turbulent @xmath0-effect .",
    "our goal was to study how the distributions of the non - dissipative angular momentum fluxes affects the meridional circulation structure in the solar convection zone .",
    "the study is motivated by the recent findings of helioseismology showing the existence of a double - cell meridional circulation pattern @xcite , and also results of the global 3d numerical simulations which often demonstrate that circulation structure can be multicellular ( see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "( background color ) and @xmath76 ( contours , in the same range as @xmath77 ) , for models : a ) m1 ; b ) m2 ; c ) m3 . ]    inspecting eqs.([eq : trf],[eq : v ] ) we see that the transport of angular momentum due to the turbulent @xmath0- effect changes from outward to inward near the equator .",
    "the near equatorial inward flux is minimal in model m1 and it grows with the decrease of parameter @xmath74 .",
    "the non - monotonic spatial dependence of the angular momentum fluxes , and the extent of the near - equatorial region occupied by the inward non - dissipative angular momentum flux provides conditions for destabilization of the taylor - praudman balance , which results to the increasing complexity of the meridional circulation pattern .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the reynolds stresses @xmath77 and @xmath76 for our set of models . in model m3 , characterized by a triple - cell circulation pattern ,",
    "the outward turbulent angular momentum fluxes are concentrated close to the surface in the mid - latitude of the solar convection zone .",
    "also , in model m3 the amplitude of the inward flux near the equator is about factor three larger than in model m1 .",
    "the turbulent reynolds stress tensor component @xmath77 is symmetric about the equator and @xmath76 is anti - symmetric . figure 5c ( model m3 ) shows a similarity with the global 3d simulations results presented by @xcite ( see figures 4,5 for run a6 in their paper ) .",
    "thus the origin of the multicellular merdional circulation pattern in their model can be explained by the latitudinal variations of the @xmath0-effect .",
    "this question should be studied further .",
    "the rotation profiles in all three models are qualitatively similar , while model m1 is , probably , in the best agreement with the results of helioseismology inversions of @xcitem models m2 and m3 also have the radial profile of the angular velocity in qualitative agreement with helioseismology .",
    "thus , we conclude that the multicellular meridional circulation structure can be explained by the mean - field models",
    ". however our models do not include the solar tachocline . from the results of @xcite",
    ", we can guess that inclusion of the tachocline may affect the taylor - paudman balance near the bottom of the convection zone and change the magnitude of the meridonal circulation .",
    "the turbulent part of the angular momentum transport is not well understood .",
    "the mean - field theory of the @xmath0-effect @xcite has some issues that are rarely discussed in the literature .",
    "the theory is constructed for forced isothermal turbulence rather than for turbulent convection .",
    "calculation of @xcite show that the @xmath0-effect functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 may have dependence on the coriolis number that is different from the results of @xcite .",
    "thus , theoretically , there is some uncertainty in the description of the turbulent angular momentum fluxes in rotating stellar convection zones .",
    "these uncertainties should be resolved using the global 3d numerical simulation and assimillation of the observational data in theoretical models .    *",
