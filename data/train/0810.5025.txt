    "supernova 1993j ( ra  =  09h",
    "55 m  24.7747s , @xmath2  =  + 69@xmath3  01  13.7031  ) was discovered on 28 march 1993 in the nearby spiral galaxy m81 ( ripero et al . , 1993 ) and became the brightest radio supernova ever observed .",
    "its brightness and high declination have allowed this object to be studied in great detail at radio wavelengths .",
    "a shell - like radio structure associated with sn1993j was resolved using vlbi techniques as early as 239 days after the supernova explosion ( marcaide et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "an extensive vlbi monitoring program then followed which tracked the expansion of the shell over seven years at three frequencies ( bietenholz , bartel & rupen , 2001 ; bartel et al .",
    ", 2002 ; bietenholz , bartel & rupen , 2003 ) .",
    "these observations yielded a wealth of information about the supernova , including accurate determination of the explosion centre , measurement of the deceleration of the ejecta and radio light curves and spectra .",
    "images of the resolved shell allowed direct monitoring of its development , from its initial barely resolved state , through expansion into partial shell structures , to the complex structure apparently present in the final epochs 3000 + days later .",
    "behaviour such as apparent rotation of features in the shell in the plane of the sky are seen between epochs of vlbi observations , as are phenomena such as coherent structures dividing into a series of peaks which apparently change in azimuthal position as the remnant expands .",
    "bietenholz , bartel and rupen ( 2003 ) discuss possible physical mechanisms which could explain the structure in the shell , including rayleigh - taylor cooling instabilities , evolving magnetic field structure and interactions with inhomogeneous circumstellar material .",
    "this paper presents a new investigation of this intriguing evolution of the brightness distribution in the expanding shell .",
    "we explore whether the development of apparently complex structure may be due to incomplete sampling of the @xmath0 plane , which is problematic especially for sparse interferometer arrays such as vlbi networks .",
    "similar effects had also been a cause for concern when interpreting 6-cm merlin images of nova cassiopeiae 1995 ( heywood et al .",
    "2005 ; heywood & obrien , 2007 ) where the apparently complex development of the radio emission could be accounted for by a spherically symmetric shell model and sparse sampling of the @xmath0-plane . with this in mind we simulated 8.4-ghz vlbi observations of the radio shell of sn1993j at nine epochs , for comparison with the genuine vlbi images .",
    "further discussion regarding the non - uniqueness of deconvolved radio images ( particularly due to the clean deconvolution method ) may be found in e.g. cornwell , braun and briggs ( 1999 ) and briggs ( 1995 ) .",
    "the latter contains a particularly relevant case study of the radio shell of sn1987a whereby different deconvolution methods yield subtle variations in apparent structure .",
    "creation of the simulated vlbi images requires two components .",
    "first , a model of the assumed source brightness distribution is required .",
    "this model should represent how an ideal instrument would image the source at a given frequency .",
    "the second component of the simulation is a @xmath0-plane sampling function which accurately represents that of the real instrument .",
    "a synchrotron shell model is used as the basis for our simulated radio images .",
    "the expansion of the shell in this model is not self - similar because the radial density profile is time dependent as the physical shell boundary expands , and reverse shocks propagate back through the ejecta .",
    "the model is fully spherically symmetric however , and the density variations are purely radial with no azimuthal component .",
    "a detailed description of this model is provided by mioduszewski et al .",
    "simulated radio images were used with ages that closely matched the epochs of the vlbi observations , and were evenly spaced throughout the evolution of sn1993j .",
    "mioduszewski et al . (",
    "2001 ) also parametrized and fitted their models to the radio observations to give consistent angular sizes and flux density values , and kindly allowed us to use their models in the investigations presented here .",
    "figure [ fig : inputmodels ] shows three epochs of the simulated radio images and their corresponding flux density profiles .    ( 16,11.0 ) ( -0.5,0.0 )      in addition to the model images being chosen to coincide as best as possible with the genuine vlbi observations the model array for each epoch is defined to be the same as those used during the sn1993j vlbi campaign .",
    "only stations which were used during an actual observation are included for the corresponding simulation .",
    "the aips task uvcon is used to generate the model @xmath0-data sets . by examining vlba archive files ,",
    "the start and end time for any observation are used to determine the total duration . using the relevant model image and an antenna file describing the stations present for a specific observation ,",
    "uvcon is executed , resulting in a track length equivalent to this total duration . in the case of the real observation",
    ", this track would encompass all sources and frequencies .    in order to reduce the @xmath0-data set such that it only includes visibilities related to sn1993j at 8.4  ghz",
    "three flag tables are applied , documenting the frequency switching information , the sn1993j scan times , and the automated flagging that occurred at the receivers .",
    "these flag tables are constructed from archival data files , and converted to a format that can be directly read by the uvflg task in aips .",
    "bad data that are manually removed from the true vlbi observations in the pre - calibration stage can not be accounted for as the simulations are not prone to problems such as radio frequency interference .",
    "this means that in each case the simulations are over - estimating the @xmath0-plane sampling , and that our analysis errs on the side of being conservative .",
    "multi - frequency interferometric observations often employ a technique to improve @xmath0-plane coverage , whereby the observing frequency is switched periodically .",
    "consider an 18-hour track at three frequencies .",
    "rather than observing at each frequency in three successive six - hour blocks the observing frequency is switched , for example every 20 minutes .",
    "the visibilities for a given frequency are therefore more spread out on the @xmath0-plane , facilitating the sampling of more diverse fourier components and reducing linear biases .",
    "determining this frequency switching information allows us to flag out scans which do not occur at 8.4  ghz .",
    "once the simulated @xmath0-tracks are consistent only with the scans at 8.4  ghz we flag out times where the calibration sources are being observed . from the archive data we can obtain the times when",
    "sn1993j was being observed and use this information to retain only these time ranges in the simulation .",
    "aips - readable flag tables describing data that were flagged at the time of the observation ( e.g. due to slewing or pointing errors , source changes etc . ) are also available , and this is the final flag table applied to the simulated data set .    note also that a 15@xmath3 elevation cut off for each antenna is also imposed on the simulation .",
    "data are routinely flagged below this elevation because system temperatures rise as the antenna points closer to the horizon , and local geographical features can often obscure the line of sight . for a source at the declination of sn1993j",
    "this condition only slightly affects the longest baselines in the vlba network .",
    "the uvcon task also adds random gaussian noise to the simulated data set , the level of which is governed by the parameters of each antenna in the array , such as the antenna efficiency and system temperature .",
    "the simulated @xmath0-data sets were imaged using the clean algorithm ( clark , 1980 ) using the aips task imagr . for each simulation",
    "the circular restoring beam used is consistent with that of the nearest epoch of the vlbi observations , as reported by bietenholz , bartel and rupen ( 2003 ) .",
    "briggs ( 1995 ) weighting was utilised with the robust parameter in imagr set to zero .",
    "for the nine simulated maps presented in figure [ fig : ninemaps ] the data were reweighted by the square roots of the data weights using the uvwtfn parameter .",
    "this is a common technique for vlbi observations and is consistent with the imaging methods of bietenholz , bartel and rupen ( 2003 ) .",
    "deconvolution was carried out interactively and the clean cycle terminated when it was judged that all substantial flux has been removed .    since no antenna - based or baseline - based amplitude or phase errors",
    "are included in our simulations , this means no self - calibration procedures will be responsible for spuriously enhancing features in our simulations .",
    "our simulations will only underestimate the extent to which small compact features could become _ reinforced _ in self - calibration and cleaning cycles .",
    "contouring of the simulated images is also carried out in a way that is consistent with the images presented by bietenholz , bartel and rupen ( 2003 ) .",
    "the greyscale in each image runs from 8% to 100% of the peak brightness for epochs below 1253 days and from 16% to 100% for epochs above .",
    "contour levels are 1% , 2% , 4% , 8% , 16% , 32% , 45% , 64% and 90% of the peak brightness in each case , starting with the first contour level that is brighter than three times the root mean square background brightness levels ( 3@xmath1 ) .",
    "presenting the simulated images in a consistent way better facilitates comparison with the real observations .",
    "in this section we first present the nine simulated radio images which best recreate the genuine vlbi observations of sn1993j .",
    "we discuss aspects of the real vlbi observations which differ from our simulations .",
    "also presented in this section are residual images created by differencing the simulated radio image from a convolved input model .",
    "figure [ fig : ninemaps ] shows the resulting images from nine simulated vlbi observations of sn1993j .",
    "a summary of the relevant image parameters can be found in table [ tab : images ] .",
    "the total shell flux density values for the simulated vlbi maps are measured by using the aips task tvstat to define the region of emission .    [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the first part of this section presents simplified simulated observations to demonstrate the coupling between the @xmath0-plane sampling and the resulting image .",
    "the second subsection takes a more realistic simulation and shows how subtle changes to the visibility data ( e.g. antenna flagging ) affect the image .      as a simplified illustration of the effects of incomplete @xmath0-sampling on azimuthal structure , figure [ fig : sixhours ] shows a simulated continuous six - hour vlbi simulation for seven different hour - angle ranges . note that",
    "the tracks are truly continuous ; there are no gaps in the visibilities .",
    "these simulations are constructed with an antenna configuration and input model both consistent with those of day 2787 of the actual vlbi observations of sn1993j .",
    "the left hand column shows the @xmath0-coverage and the right hand column shows the resulting map .",
    "the most notable feature in this series of images is that as the @xmath0-coverage rotates with hour angle , _ so does the structure of the corresponding image_. the position of the peaks on the ring rotate , as does the central ` bar ' in the image .",
    "note that the input model is purely circularly symmetric with no angular structure variations ( see figure [ fig : inputmodels ] ) , therefore _",
    "none of the complex structure in the final images is real _    in order to quantify the azimuthal structure that is imparted to an image , and demonstrate how it is radically affected by the @xmath0-coverage , the pixel values as a function of angle are presented in figure [ fig : greyscales ] . this simulation is carried out 24 times with the hour - angle coverage drifting by 30 minutes each time , using day 2787 as the input model .",
    "the resulting images are 512 @xmath4 512 pixels in size , and the pixel values are measured around a ring with a radius of 141 pixels with respect to the image centre , which on these images corresponds to 3.8 milliarcseconds .",
    "this value was chosen as it corresponds to the radius of the brightest annulus of emission on the input model .",
    "( 16,11.9 ) ( -1.0,-0.6 )    plotting the brightness distribution in this way allows one to clearly see how the structure rotates with the @xmath0 coverage .",
    "the brightest peaks in the image appear as dark patches and the rotation manifests itself here as the diagonal striping in figure [ fig : greyscales ] .      to illustrate how apparently subtle changes to the visibility data",
    "can alter the structure in the final image , figure [ fig : uv_decay ] presents @xmath0 plots and corresponding images for three different simulated observations .",
    "these are created using the simulation corresponding to day 2525 .",
    "contour and greyscale levels , and the restoring beam , are consistent with the day 2525 simulation presented in figure [ fig : ninemaps ] .",
    "the left hand pair shows the simulation with the 15 degree elevation cut off applied . for a source at the declination of sn1993j the effect this cut off",
    "has on the @xmath0 coverage compared to that of a zero degree elevation cut off is minimal ; in our simulation it reduced the number of visibilities by less than 3% .",
    "the effect this elevation cut off has on the plot of @xmath0-plane coverage is subtle and difficult to notice by eye .",
    "as such the complete plot is not presented here .    to illustrate potential problems that may be caused by local geographical features the centre pair of images simulation has an asymmetric ( + 35@xmath3/+15@xmath3 ) elevation cut off imposed on the mauna kea station .",
    "this drastically affects the longest baselines and consequently alters the structure in the corresponding image . for the final image the st .",
    "croix station is entirely removed , which mainly affects the intermediate length baselines as shown by the two prominent gaps in the @xmath0 plot .",
    "further simulations can be found in appendix a where we present a range of simulated images corresponding to the day 2787 epoch for a range of declinations , track lengths and hour angle ranges .",
    "( 16,9.9 ) ( 0.6,-0.3 )",
    "we have demonstrated in this paper how sparse @xmath0 coverage can impart apparently complex azimuthal structure to a radio brightness distribution that is in reality morphologically simple .",
    "rotation of the @xmath0-plane sampling pattern determined by varying hour angle coverage leads to a corresponding rotation in the radio image .",
    "this is just one example of the kind of structures that are vulnerable to errors arising from sparse @xmath0-plane sampling . for a full discussion of other structures and their vulnerabilities",
    "we refer the reader to the works by cornwell ( 1999 ) and briggs ( 1995 ) who investigate the use of different deconvolution methods which further undermine these structures and can not completely overcome the problems caused by incomplete information .    by reconstructing the @xmath0-plane distributions achieved in the sn1993j vlbi campaign and convolving these with a perfect spherically symmetric model of the supernova ,",
    "we have shown that sparse @xmath0 coverage may be wholly or partially responsible for the evolving complex azimuthal structure observed in real supernova remnant .",
