    "it is a well - known fact that solutions to general relativity which describe traversable wormholes require the existence of exotic matter , i.e. , matter which violates the null energy condition ( nec )  @xcite .",
    "the latter states that for any null vector @xmath0 , the energy - momentum tensor @xmath1 satisfies @xmath2 .",
    "the violation of the nec is a consequence of the `` flaring - out condition ''  @xcite which follows from the existence of a wormhole throat where its radius is minimal , and where @xmath3 for some null vector @xmath0 .",
    "the einstein equations @xmath4 then imply that also @xmath5 .",
    "this was first shown for static , spherically symmetric wormholes  @xcite and later generalized to non - static , non - symmetric wormholes  @xcite . however ,",
    "this result crucially depends on the gravitational field equations , and indeed in modified gravity theories the requirement of exotic matter can be minimized or even completely avoided  @xcite . in these theories",
    "the nec , being a condition on the matter energy - momentum tensor , does not translate to a geometric constraint in the same way as in general relativity , and instead leads to possibly weaker conditions on the allowed geometries  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to show that wormhole solutions without exotic matter also exist in multimetric gravity theories . in the following",
    "we present a simple , static , spherically symmetric , traversable wormhole solution and show that it satisfies all energy conditions .",
    "in this article we study wormholes in the context of a recently discussed class of multimetric gravity theories containing @xmath6 metric tensors @xmath7 and a corresponding number of standard model copies @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the action of these theories is of the common form @xmath9 + \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}s_m[g^i , \\varphi^i]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 $ ] denotes the standard model action and the gravitational part of the action is given by @xmath11 here @xmath12 are constants , @xmath13 denotes the mixed volume form @xmath14 and @xmath15 is quadratic in the connection difference tensors @xmath16 formed from the christoffel symbols of the different metrics .",
    "it follows from the structure of the action   that each standard model copy couples only to its own metric tensor @xmath17 , and therefore obeys a well - defined causality .",
    "it moreover follows that the interaction between the different standard model copies is mediated only through gravity , so that they mutually appear dark .",
    "this can also be seen from the gravitational field equations , which are derived by variation of the total action with respect to the metric tensors .",
    "they take the form @xmath18 = 8\\pi t^i_{ab}[g^i , \\varphi^i]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 are the usual standard model energy - momentum tensors derived from the matter action @xmath20 and the curvature tensors @xmath21 are analogously derived from the gravitational action @xmath22",
    ". a closer look at the terms in the gravitational part   of the action further shows that @xmath21 is of second derivative order and contains only terms which are built from the ricci tensors @xmath23 and originate from the first two terms in @xmath22 , as well as terms which are either quadratic in the connection difference tensors @xmath24 or linear in their covariant derivatives @xmath25 with respect to the levi - civita connection @xmath26 of @xmath17 .",
    "we further restrict ourselves to theories which employ the copernican principle in the sense that the action and in consequence also the field equations are symmetric with respect to permutations of the @xmath27 sectors . in the newtonian limit",
    "the gravitational field equations then yield the most general poisson equations compatible with this symmetry , @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the matter densities and the newtonian potentials @xmath30 enter the metric in the form @xmath31 .",
    "the constants appearing here are the usual newtonian constant @xmath32 , which measures the gravitational force within each of the sectors and which we rescale to @xmath33 by a choice of units , and a second newtonian constant @xmath34 measuring the gravitational force between different standard model copies .",
    "this newtonian limit is implemented if the constants @xmath12 satisfy @xmath35 in order to elucidate this we explicitly write out the simplest possible case @xmath36 , where the poisson equation   takes the form @xmath37 in units where @xmath33 , and is achieved if the constants   satisfy @xmath38 . note that this relation excludes the value @xmath39 , for which the two matter types @xmath40 would repel each other with equal strength compared to the gravitational attraction within each of the two sectors .",
    "this exclusion has been proven earlier in terms of a no - go theorem  @xcite .",
    "the theorem states at its core that the matrix on the right hand side of the poisson equation   must be invertible , which is equivalent to the right hand side of   being non - singular .",
    "this no - go theorem together with the intent to examine also the simple choice @xmath39 are the reason why we extend our discussion to the more general multimetric case @xmath6 here .",
    "we finally remark that experimental consistency at the post - newtonian level further requires a non - vanishing term @xmath15 and restricts its form  @xcite .",
    "however , we will not discuss these constraints here since they will turn out to be irrelevant for the remainder of this article .",
    "we now turn our focus to a particular class of solutions to multimetric gravity which are symmetric under permutations of the sectors , i.e. , in which all metrics @xmath17 are equal .",
    "it then follows from our assumption on the symmetry of the field equations   that also all energy - momentum tensors @xmath19 are equal .",
    "we further see from the structure of the gravitational action   that the field equations simplify in the case of equal metrics : all connection difference tensors @xmath24 vanish , all ricci tensors @xmath23 are equal and the remaining terms take the simple form @xmath41 here we have already dropped the sector indices @xmath42 , since also all einstein tensors @xmath43 are equal , and introduced an effective gravitational constant @xmath44 .",
    "we have thus reproduced the einstein equations , up to an additional factor .",
    "hence , every solution to general relativity induces a symmetric solution to our multimetric gravity theories , where @xmath1 is to be replaced by @xmath45 .",
    "the effective gravitational constant appearing here deserves particular attention .",
    "it follows from the relation   that @xmath46 becomes negative provided that the gravitational interaction between different standard model copies is repulsive and of sufficient strength , @xmath47 in the simple bimetric case @xmath36 this condition is satisfied for @xmath48 , which means that the mutual repulsion between different standard model copies must be stronger than the gravitational attraction within each matter sector .",
    "another arguably simple case is to fix @xmath39 , which then requires the number of metrics to be @xmath49 .",
    "the latter choice has been considered earlier in the context of cosmology , where the negative effective gravitational constant in the simplified field equations   yields an accelerating expansion of the universe  @xcite .",
    "we remark that this accelerating expansion can also be achieved in the bimetric case @xmath36 with @xmath48 since it depends only on the sign of the effective gravitational constant @xmath46 .    in the remainder of this article",
    "we will consider both cases , since it will turn out that @xmath46 is the only crucial ingredient for our discussion of the energy conditions , so that any choice of @xmath6 is allowed .",
    "the solution we discuss in the following is the static , spherically symmetric , traversable wormhole connecting two asymptotically minkowski spacetimes , which is given by the metric  @xcite @xmath50 the radial coordinate @xmath51 we use here is chosen so that the circumference of a circle around the center of the wormhole is given by @xmath52 .",
    "the spacetime manifold consists of two charts in both of which @xmath53 for a constant @xmath54 , and which are glued together at the wormhole throat @xmath55 . for the functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 , called the redshift and shape functions , we choose @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "one easily checks that the spacetime defined by this choice is asymptotically flat , since @xmath60 and @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "it does not possess any horizons , since @xmath63 is everywhere finite .",
    "finally , from the flaring - out condition @xmath64 follows that it has indeed the shape of a wormhole  @xcite .",
    "the latter can also be seen from an isometric embedding of the wormhole spacetime in a flat @xmath65-dimensional spacetime . denoting the additional spatial coordinate by @xmath66 , the embedded hypersurface is given by @xmath67\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath68 denotes the euler gamma function and @xmath69 denotes the incomplete euler beta function @xmath70 the upper half @xmath71 of this embedding",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : whembed ] .",
    "-dimensional flat spacetime for @xmath72 from top to bottom .",
    "the plot shows only the coordinates @xmath51 and @xmath66 for the upper end @xmath71 of the wormhole.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "inserting the metric   into the symmetric gravitational field equations   we find the energy - momentum tensor @xmath73 in order to test whether the energy conditions are satisfied we use the tangent space basis @xmath74 which is orthonormal with respect to the metric  . in this basis the non - vanishing components of the energy - momentum tensor  , @xmath75 are the matter density @xmath76 , the radial pressure @xmath77 and the lateral pressure @xmath78 . using these variables",
    "we find the expressions @xmath79 for the null energy condition , @xmath80 for the weak energy condition , @xmath81 for the dominant energy condition and @xmath82 for the strong energy condition  @xcite .",
    "one can immediately read off that all energy conditions are satisfied for the values   provided that the matter density @xmath76 is positive .",
    "this is the case for a negative effective gravitational constant @xmath46 .",
    "the negative factor in the symmetric gravitational field equations   therefore allows us to sustain a traversable wormhole using only ordinary , non - exotic matter .",
    "as another interesting property we calculate the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass  @xcite of our wormhole solution . for the metric   we find @xmath83 where the last equality follows from the definition   of the shape function @xmath84 .",
    "the ( undisturbed ) wormhole therefore appears massless to observers in the two asymptotically minkowski spacetimes .",
    "this is no longer true if we consider massive objects passing through the wormhole  @xcite ; however , this goes beyond the scope of this article .",
    "given a wormhole solution which is sustained by only non - exotic matter , one may speculate on the possibility to create and maintain such a wormhole .",
    "unfortunately already a simple thought experiment shows that the construction of a multimetric wormhole is beyond any practical feasibility , and unlikely to happen naturally .",
    "the main problem arises from the fact that in order to work with the simplified field equations   we needed to construct a solution in which all metrics @xmath17 , and therefore the energy - momentum tensors @xmath19 for all standard model copies , are equal .",
    "we further needed to assume that different standard model copies repel each other , so that the effective gravitational constant @xmath46 in the field equations   becomes negative .",
    "it thus follows that the assembly of a wormhole sustained by equal amounts of all @xmath27 matter types is obstructed by their mutual repulsion , and thus unlikely to occur naturally . also for a civilization constituted by one of the standard model copies the construction of a multimetric wormhole is practically impossible , since the only way to interact with and assemble the other @xmath85 matter types , which appear dark to this civilization , is by means of gravity .",
    "it would rather need the cooperation of @xmath27 civilizations , each constituted by a different matter type , coordinating their efforts using gravitational communication , to effectively manipulate the sustaining matter of the wormhole .",
    "finally , even if these civilizations should manage to assemble a wormhole , it is very likely to be unstable against fluctuations , since any shift of the different matter types with respect to each other would cause them to further separate and disrupt the wormhole due to their mutual repulsion .",
    "we conclude that even though non - exotic wormhole solutions to multimetric gravity theories exist , their construction and maintenance is far from being feasible even by the joint effort of several advanced civilizations .",
    "similar considerations may apply to other spacetime geometries which require exotic matter in general relativity , such as warp drives : even if one finds a warp drive spacetime which does not require exotic matter in multimetric gravity , it will probably suffer from the same drawbacks which obstruct its practical realization .",
