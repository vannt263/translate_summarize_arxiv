    "lavo@xmath11 and lamno@xmath11 attract a great scientific interest by more than 50 years [ 1,2 ] .",
    "despite of it there is still strong discussion about the description of its properties and its electronic structure .",
    "a controversy starts already with the description of the electronic ground state . for v@xmath12o@xmath2 , a canonical compound of lavo@xmath11",
    "there is within a localized paradigm a long - standing controversy between a _",
    "s_=1 model without an orbital degeneracy [ 3 ] and the historically first @xmath13=1/2 orbitally degenerate model of castellani et al.[1 ] . a spin-1 model with three degenerate orbitals",
    "was worked out by di matteo [ 4 ] whereas refs [ 5,6 ] develop a model where the fluctuations of t@xmath14 orbitals and frustrations play prominent role in magnetism of lavo@xmath2 .    in all of these considerations",
    "it is agreed that lavo@xmath11 is an insulating antiferromagnet with the neel temperature of 135 - 140 k. lamno@xmath11 is also insulating antiferromagnet with t@xmath15 of 140 k. the basis for all theories is the description of the v@xmath1 ion ( 2 d electrons ) and the mn@xmath1 ion ( 4 d electrons ) and their electronic structure in the perovskite crystallographic structure . in the perovskite - based structure of lavo@xmath2 and",
    "lamno@xmath2 the v and mn ions are placed in a distorted oxygen octahedron .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a consistent description of the low - energy electronic structure and of the magnetism of lavo@xmath11 and lamno@xmath11 as originating from the atomic - like electronic structure of the strongly - correlated 3@xmath16 and 3@xmath17 electronic systems occurring in the v@xmath1 and mn@xmath1 ions . in our description",
    "local atomic - scale effects , the orbital magnetism and the intra - atomic spin - orbit coupling play the fundamentally important role in determination of properties of the whole compound .",
    "according to our approach to 3d compounds , that seems to be very natural , but is far from being accepted within the magnetic community , two @xmath19 electrons of the v@xmath1 ion in the incomplete 3@xmath19 shell in lavo@xmath11 form the strongly correlated intra - atomic 3@xmath16 electron system .",
    "these strong correlations among the 3@xmath19 electrons we account for by two hund s rules , that yield the @xmath20 ground term , fig . 1a . in the oxygen octahedron surroundings , realized in the perovskite structure of lavo@xmath11 , the @xmath20 term splits into two orbital triplets @xmath21t@xmath6 , @xmath21t@xmath14 and an orbital singlet @xmath22 . in the octahedron with negative oxygen ions",
    "the ground subterm is orbital triplet @xmath21t@xmath6 as is shown in fig .",
    "all orbital states are triply spin degenerated .",
    "this degeneration is removed by the intra - atomic spin - orbit coupling that is always present in the ion / atom .",
    "the effect of the spin - orbit coupling is shown in fig .",
    "1c . for low - temperature properties the lowest 5 states of nine states of the @xmath21t@xmath6 subterm are important .",
    "off - octahedral distortions causes further splitting of the shown states - important is that there is no more low - energy states as only shown .",
    "the present calculations have been performed with a realistic octahedral cef parameter b@xmath23= -40 k ( = 10dq = 600b@xmath23= 2.06 ev ) and the spin - orbit coupling as is observed in the free ion , i.e. @xmath24= + 150 k. the spin - orbit coupling effect amounts only to 3@xmath25 the cef effect but it has enormous influence on the eigen - functions and low - temperature properties .    the derived many - electron electronic structure of the d@xmath0 configuration is completely different from very simplified electronic structure , shown in fig .",
    "1d , usually presented in the current literature with two parallel spin - electrons in the triply degenerated t@xmath14 orbitals .",
    "we do not know , why such an oversimplified scheme is usually shown despite of the fact that the many - electron cef approach is known already by almost 70 years , though it is true that it was rather used not to a solid , but to 3d ions as impurities in electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) experiments [ 7 ] .",
    "for completeness of the description of the d@xmath0 configuration we can add that for two @xmath19 electrons there is in total 45 states that in the free v@xmath1 ion are arranged into 5 terms ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "the 21-fold degenerated @xmath26 term is the lowest one according to two hund s rules ( @xmath13=1 , @xmath31=3 ) - it is a reason that its splitting we show in fig .",
    "1 . the octahedral cef splits these 45 states in 5 terms into 11 subterms as has been calculated almost 50 years ago by tanabe and sugano [ 8 ] . a @xmath32 state , usually recalled in the literature ,",
    "is related to the very strong crystal - field limit notation and is 15-fold degenerated .",
    "it contains 4 subterms : @xmath5t@xmath6 , @xmath33t@xmath14 , @xmath33e@xmath10 , @xmath33a@xmath6 with the lowest @xmath5t@xmath6 subterm . in our approach , quantum atomistic solid - state theory , to 3d - ion compounds",
    "we assume the cef to be stronger than the spin - orbit coupling , but not so strong to destroy intra - atomic correlations .",
    "thus we are working in an intermediate crystal - field limit .",
    "2 we present results of our calculations for the paramagnetic susceptibility for different physical situations , without the spin - orbit coupling and with and without octahedral crystal field , which are shown in the @xmath34 @xmath35 t plot .",
    "these two curves , without the spin - orbit coupling , resemble the curie law but with the paramagnetic effective moment much larger than expected for the free @xmath13=1 spin , of 2.82 @xmath4 .",
    "an introduction of the spin - orbit interactions causes dramatic change of the @xmath34 @xmath35 t plot - the curie law is broken . if one would like to analyze this @xmath34 @xmath35 t plot within the conventional paradigm would infer a curie - weiss law with an appearance of af interactions with @xmath36 of about 500 k. however , such the c - w behaviour appears here as the effect of the intra - atomic spin - orbit coupling .",
    "for calculations of the magnetic state apart of the a single - ion like cef hamiltonian we take into account additionally intersite spin - dependent interactions ( n@xmath38 - molecular field coefficient , magnetic moment @xmath39 = -(l+2s)@xmath4 ) [ 9 ] : + h=@xmath40+@xmath41= @xmath42    in equation ( 1 ) the first term is the crystal - field hamiltonian : here we work with b@xmath23= -40 k ( an ordinary point - charge octahedron with the v - o distance of 2.0 @xmath43 gives b@xmath23= -18 k ) and a small tetragonal distortion b@xmath12=",
    "-60 k. the second term takes into account intersite spin - dependent interactions that is necessary to produce the magnetic order below t@xmath15 .",
    "the self - consistent calculations have been performed similarly to that presented in ref .",
    "[ 9 ] for febr@xmath44 .",
    "the calculated temperature dependence of the magnetic moment is shown in fig .",
    "3 . a value of 1.3 @xmath45 and @xmath46 of 140 k are in perfect agreement with experimental observations . we have to add , however , that due to 5 closely lying discrete states the v@xmath1 ion is very susceptible to lattice distortions and details of magnetic interactions .",
    "in our view , the four @xmath19 electrons of the mn@xmath1 ion in the incomplete 3@xmath19 shell in lamno@xmath11 form the strongly correlated intra - atomic 3@xmath17 electron system . these strong correlations among the 3@xmath19 electrons we account for by two hund s rules , that yield the @xmath48 ground term , fig .",
    "1a , with @xmath13=2 and @xmath31=2 . in the oxygen octahedron surroundings , realized in the perovskite structure of lamno@xmath11 , the @xmath48 term splits into the orbital doublet @xmath49 as the ground subterm , fig .",
    "1b , and the excited orbital triplet @xmath50t@xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath51 ground subterm comes out from _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for the octupolar potential , the a@xmath52 cef coefficient acting on the mn@xmath1 ion from the oxygen negative charges .",
    "such the atomic - like 3@xmath17 system interacts with the charge and spin surroundings in the solid .    in ref .",
    "10 we have described lamno@xmath2 with the octahedral cef parameter @xmath53 = -13 mev , @xmath54=+10 mev , the spin - orbit coupling parameter @xmath55=+33 mev and the molecular - field coefficient n=-26.3 t/@xmath56 .",
    "we get a value of 3.72 @xmath56 for the mn@xmath1-ion ordered magnetic moment that orders magnetically along the @xmath57 axis within the tetragonal plane .",
    "the magnetic interactions set up at 0 k the molecular field of 108 t ( in case of lavo@xmath2 we get 156 t ) .",
    "the calculated magnetic moment of 3.72 @xmath56 is built up from the spin moment of + 3.96 @xmath56 and from the orbital moment of -0.24 @xmath56 .",
    "although the orbital moment is relatively small its presence modifies completely the electronic structure similarly as occurs in case of the v@xmath1 ion .",
    "we advocate by years for the importance of the crystal - field - based approach to transition - metal compounds . of course",
    ", we do not claim that cef explains everything ( surely cef itself can not explain the formation of a magnetic ordering , for which in eq .",
    "1 we add the second term ) , but surely the atomic - like 4f/5f/3d cation is the source of the magnetism of a whole solid .",
    "the atomic - scale magnetic moment is determined by local effects known as crystal field and spin - orbit interactions as well as very strong electron correlations .",
    "these strong electron correlations are predominantly of the intra - atomic origin and are taking into account , in the first approximation , via on - site hund s rules .",
    "these strong correlations lead to many - electron version of the cef approach in contrary to the single - electron version of the cef presently popular .",
    "finally , we use a name `` @xmath19 electrons '' , as often is used in literature .",
    "of course , @xmath19 electrons are not special electrons but it means electrons in @xmath19 states .",
    "@xmath19 states have well defined characteristics , like the orbital quantum number @xmath58 . by identifying states in a solid",
    "we can identified @xmath19 electrons , in particular their number .",
    "we have calculated electronic structures of d@xmath0 and d@xmath3 systems occurring in v@xmath1 and mn@xmath1 ions in lavo@xmath2 and lamno@xmath2 taking into account strong electron correlations and the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "on basis of our studies we reject a possibility for an orbital liquid both in lavo@xmath2 and lamno@xmath2 .",
    "both ions are strongly susceptible to lattice distortions .",
    "we reproduce a value of 1.3 @xmath56 for the v@xmath1-ion magnetic moment as well as the neel temperature .",
    "we advocate for years for an atomistic crystal - field approach to 3d - ion compounds with a discrete electronic structure and the insulating ground state as an alternative to the band picture [ 11 ] knowing its enormous shortage in description of 3d oxides ( metallic instead ionic ground state , for instance ) .",
    "our approach accounts both for the insulating ground state , magnetism as well as thermodynamical properties .",
