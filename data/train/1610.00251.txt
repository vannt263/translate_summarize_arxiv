    "seismic imaging attempts to obtain detailed images of the subsurface from seismic data .",
    "such data are obtained by placing explosive sources on or near the surface and recording the response with a large array of receivers at the surface . by repeating the experiment many times for varying source position ,",
    "enough data can be gathered to form useful images .",
    "the scale of these experiments varies from tens of meters , for instance , for near - surface imaging , to tens of kilometers in oil and gas exploration , up to the whole earth in global seismology . for hydrocarbon exploration",
    ", depths typically extend to several kilometers .",
    "one of the main challenges of seismic imaging is that the propagation velocity of the seismic waves traveling through the subsurface is unknown .",
    "since this velocity can vary significantly , both laterally and with depth , it has to be estimated prior to applying a conventional imaging method .",
    "a wrong subsurface velocity can lead to severely distorted images .",
    "the conventional workflow for seismic imaging , therefore , is to first estimate the subsurface velocity and subsequently back - propagate the data to obtain an image .",
    "the success of this two - step approach relies crucially on the ability to separate propagation and reflection effects in the data .",
    "this can only be done if the earth structure is relatively simple , e.g. smoothly varying with small perturbations .",
    "a particularly relevant setting in which the separation - of - scales argument fails to hold is in the presence of strong contrasts , such as salt diapirs , salt slabs , anhydrite or basalt layers .",
    "salt geometries are of particular interest because they often have hydrocarbon reservoirs on their sides or underneath .",
    "full - waveform inversion ( fwi ) attempts to fit the data using a fairly precise numerical model for wave - propagation in heterogeneous media . by posing the inverse problem as a non - linear least - squares problem , the velocity structure in the subsurface can ,",
    "in principle , be estimated quantitatively . however , this optimization problem is severely non - linear and ill - posed , making it very difficult to obtain reasonable results without a good initial guess of the velocity parameters . starting from an initial guess that is far away from the truth often leads to an incorrect subsurface model .",
    "while many approaches have been proposed to mitigate this problem , the issue remains unsolved .    in this paper , we aim to alleviate the ill - posedness of the problem to some extent by adding an appropriate regularization .",
    "in the particular setting of salt bodies , it is reasonable to assume that the subsurface can be described as one or more continuous bodies ( salt ) with known constant material parameters , surrounded by continuously varying parameters ( sediment ) .",
    "our approach is based on a level - set method , where we explicitly represent the shape of the salt body with a level - set function . by expanding the level - set function in some basis ,",
    "we greatly reduce the effective number of parameters and obtain a non - linear optimization problem that is better behaved than the original non - linear least - squares problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ fwi ] , we review the details of the classical fwi approach and give an overview regularization approaches specifically aimed at the reconstruction of salt bodies . in section [ levelset ] , we present the basics of the parametric level - set method and discuss several practical issues in detail .",
    "numerical results on a stylized seismic example are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "full waveform inversion ( fwi ) is non - linear data - fitting scheme aiming to retrieve detailed estimates of subsurface properties from seismic data .",
    "the basic workflow of fwi is as follows : _ ( 1 ) _ predict the observed data by solving a wave - equation , given an initial guess of the subsurface velocity , _ ( 2 ) _ compute the difference between predicted and observed data , and _ ( 3 ) _ update the velocity in order to improve the data fit .",
    "this process is repeated in an iterative fashion until the residual drops below some tolerance .",
    "an excellent overview of various flavors of this basic scheme can be found in @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to model seismic wave propagation , we refer the reader to the reviews by @xcite and @xcite . for our purpose , it suffices to consider a two - dimensional scalar helmholtz equation that models the acoustic pressure :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 denotes the subsurface position , @xmath2 is the squared slowness with units @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the angular frequency , @xmath5 the source term and @xmath6 the pressure wavefield .",
    "we consider an unbounded domain and impose sommerfeld radiation boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the observed data are modeled by solving for several sources @xmath7 and sampling the resulting wavefields @xmath8 at locations @xmath9 and frequencies @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11    the inverse problem is now to retrieve @xmath2 from a set of observations @xmath12 .",
    "this problem has been extensively studied and uniqueness results are available for a few specific cases , including layered earth - models , small perturbations around a known smooth reference medium and asymptotic versions of the problem .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an extensive overview .",
    "a common approach to the inverse problem is to first discretize and solve the wave equation for forward modelling and to subsequently formulate a finite - dimensional data - fitting problem .",
    "a fintie - difference discretization of on an @xmath13-point grid with absorbing boundary conditions leads to a sparse system of equations @xmath14 where @xmath15 is structurally symmetric and indefinite .",
    "various dispersion - minimizing finite - difference stencils have been proposed in the literature @xcite and several absorbing boundary conditions are described in @xcite .",
    "the system of equations can be solved by a decomposition of @xmath16 such as the lu ( lower and upper triangular ) decomposition .",
    "the advantage of this direct approach is that , once the decomposition has been performed , the system can be solved efficiently for multiple sources by forward and backward substitution @xcite .",
    "the direct approach with nested dissection @xcite is efficient for 2-d problems @xcite .",
    "however , the time and memory complexities of lu factorization and its limited scalability on large - scale distributed memory platforms prevent its application to large - scale 3-d problems that may involve more than 10 million unknowns @xcite .",
    "helmholtz - specific factorization methods have been developed @xcite , but these are only suitable when the computational cost can be amortized over many sources .",
    "iterative solvers provide an alternative approach for solving the helmholtz equation @xcite .",
    "these iterative solvers are usually implemented with krylov subspace methods @xcite that are preconditioned by solving a damped helmholtz equation .",
    "the solution of the damped equation is computed efficiently with a multigrid method .",
    "the main advantage of the iterative approach is the low memory requirement , although the main drawback results from the difficulty to design an efficient preconditioner because @xmath16 is indefinite @xcite . also , the iterative scheme has to be started again for each source .",
    "organizing the observations in a vector @xmath17 with @xmath18 , we introduce the forward operator @xmath19 application of the forward operator on a given model @xmath20 involves the solution of @xmath21 helmholtz equations , including the lu - decomposition , and constitutes the main computational cost of fwi .",
    "the conventional least - squares formulation of fwi can now be expressed as @xmath22 this optimization problem is typically solved with a newton - like algorithm @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the step size and @xmath25 denotes ( an approximation of ) the hessian of @xmath26 at iteration @xmath27 .",
    "the gradient of the objective is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the jacobian of @xmath30 and @xmath31 denotes its adjoint .",
    "in practice , the jacobian matrix is never formed explicitly but its action is computed using the _ adjoint - state method _ @xcite .",
    "this entails solving @xmath32 linear systems with @xmath33 and the residual as right - hand sides .",
    "the action of the ( gauss - newton ) hessian may be computed in a similar fashion at the cost of additional helmholtz - solves @xcite .",
    "this can be done cheaply in 2d if the lu factors are stored in memory @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , waveform inversion is hampered by the presence of local minima in @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "in practice , this requires a good initial estimate of the parameters @xmath20 . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "the data can be inverted in a multi - scale fashion , starting at some lowest frequency available in the data and using the inversion result to initialize a next pass at a higher frequency @xcite .",
    "the low frequencies are important in reconstructing the large - scale variations in the model , while high frequencies fill in the details .",
    "other multi - scale continuation approaches have been proposed as well @xcite .",
    "all of these will fail , however , when the initial guess does not explain the observations well enough for the lowest available frequency .",
    "many alternative formulations have been proposed that depart from the usual data - fitting approach @xcite .",
    "while these approaches can to some extent mitigate the non - linearity of the problem , they do not solve the inherent ill - posedness of the problem .",
    "this means that some features of @xmath20 are simply not recoverable , regardless of the method we use to estimate the parameters . to address this problem ,",
    "we need to add regularization .",
    "we distinguish two types of regularization : _ implicit _ regularization , where we add a penalty @xmath34 to the objective in to penalize unwanted features , and _ explicit _",
    "regularization , where we expand @xmath20 in an appropriate basis that contains only the features we desire .",
    "for example , when we expect the model to vary smoothly , we can penalize the second derivative by a penalty term @xmath35 with @xmath36 the discrete laplace operator .",
    "alternatively , we can choose a representation of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 consists of smooth basis functions such as b - splines .",
    "this type of regularization works well when the scales of the model are separable , since we can invert for a smoothly varying velocity from low - frequency data @xcite .    in some geological settings , however , the scales do _ not _ separate , and we need to find an alternative form of regularization . if we expect our model to have strong discontinuities , a popular choice is a total - variation ( tv ) regularization with @xmath39 , with @xmath40 a discrete gradient operator @xcite .",
    "a natural basis is hard to define in this case .",
    "alternatively , we can regularize the model by imposing the constraint @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage is that tv regularization acts globally and causes the model to be blocky everywhere .",
    "nevertheless , some promising results have been obtained recently @xcite .",
    "here , we investigate an alternative to tv regularization and propose a mixed representation for the particular case of salt bodies .",
    "we represent @xmath2 as being constant in a certain region and continuously varying elsewhere .",
    "we start again from the continuous formulation of the inverse problem and derive a finite - dimensional optimization problem analogous to .",
    "we represent @xmath42 as @xmath43 here , @xmath44 indicates the salt - body , @xmath45 is the constant value of the model parameter inside the salt body and @xmath46 denotes the spatially varying parameters in the sediment .",
    "[ fig : models ] sketches three different models , representing the smooth variation , blocky structure and a combination of both .",
    "model 1 is a typical sediment structure , while model 2 represents the salt geometry .",
    "we generally expect a seismic velocity distribution similar to model 3 , combining model 1 & 2 .",
    "we can represent the model formally as @xmath47m_0(\\mathbf{x } ) + \\chi_{\\omega}(\\mathbf{x})m_1,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the indicator function of @xmath44 .",
    "the inverse problem now consists of finding the set @xmath44 and the model parameters @xmath46 and @xmath45 .    the basic idea behind the level - set method is to represent the domain @xmath44 through a level - set function as @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "this then leads us to represent the indicator function as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the heaviside function @xmath52 .    to be able to compute sensitivities ,",
    "one typically uses a smooth approximation of the heaviside function .",
    "a common choice is @xmath53 where @xmath54 as @xmath55 .",
    "this function has the nice property that its derivative is everywhere non - zero .",
    "a disadvantage is that , in order to accurately represent the indicator function , the level - set function @xmath56 will need to tend to @xmath57 .",
    "this induces very steep gradients in @xmath56 around the boundary of the level - set . in turn",
    ", these steep gradients in @xmath56 require that we pick a proportionally large @xmath58 to remain sensitive to changes in the level - set .",
    "this suggest that we pick @xmath58 in accordance with the ( maximum ) gradient of @xmath56 .",
    "we will get back to this observation in section [ shape ] .    to avoid some of these issues",
    ", we use a smooth heaviside defined by @xmath59   & \\quad \\text{if } -\\epsilon \\leq s \\leq",
    "\\epsilon , \\\\      1   & \\quad \\text{if } s > \\epsilon.\\\\    \\end{cases}\\ ] ] to avoid getting trapped in the region where @xmath60 , we again have to pick @xmath58 in accordance with the ( maximum ) gradient of @xmath56 .",
    "a practical heuristic to pick @xmath58 and adapt it to the current @xmath56 will be discussed in section [ shape ] .",
    "the level - set method was originally introduced for tracking regions in fluid flow applications , providing a natural way to evolve the level - set by solving a hamilton - jacobi equation @xcite . in applications like fwi , it is not obvious how to update @xmath56 away from the boundary of @xmath44 , because @xmath61 quickly tends to zero .",
    "the problem of finding the level - set function is ill - posed .      to mitigate this ,",
    "we adopt a method proposed in @xcite and represent the level - set function with a finite set of radial basis functions ( rbfs ) : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a rbf , @xmath64 are the nodes and @xmath65 is a scaling parameter .",
    "the choice of rbf will be discussed in more detail in the next subsection .",
    "discretization on an @xmath13-point grid leads to the so - called rbf - kernel matrix @xmath66 with elements @xmath67 , allowing us to represent the parameters as @xmath68 where @xmath69 represents element - wise multiplication , also known as hadamard product .",
    "we can now define the corresponding optimization problem for the parametric level - set approach , for fixed @xmath70 , as @xmath71 the gradient of this objective is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73      radial basis functions are a means to approximate smooth multivariate functions .",
    "they have been extensively studied in the context of the interpolation of scattered data in high dimensions and for meshless methods @xcite .",
    "rbfs are classified into two main types , global rbfs , which have infinite support , and compactly supported rbfs .",
    "next , we discuss some relevant properties when we consider approximating a given smooth function @xmath56 using rbfs .",
    "global rbfs have infinite support and hence the rbf kernel matrix @xmath74 is dense .",
    "an overview of several common global rbfs is given in table [ table : globalrbf ] and their radial behavior is shown in fig .",

    "accurately determining the geometry of subsurface salt bodies from seismic data is a difficult problem .",
    "when casting the inverse problem into a non - linear data - fitting problem , both the presence of local minima and the ill - posedness of the problem prevent accurate recovery of the salt - geometry .",
    "we have investigated the application of a parametric level - set method to address this problem .",
    "we represent the earth model as a continuously varying background with an embedded salt body.the salt geometry is described by the zero contour of a level - set function , which in turn is represented with a relatively small number of radial basis functions .",
