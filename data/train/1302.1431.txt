    "the robinson congruence features prominently as a framework to which many different physical fields are associated via the penrose transform . from the twistor perspective @xcite all solutions of the massless spin-@xmath0 field equations in minkowski space",
    "are seen to arise from the singularities of homogeneous functions on twistor space .",
    "of particular note are the elementary states of penrose @xcite which are constructed from homogeneous twistor functions whose vanishing defines a robinson congruence .",

    "moreover , the relationship between the vacuum maxwell , massless dirac , massless rarita - schwinger , and linearized vacuum einstein equations , as expressed in the form of the massless spin-@xmath0 field equations , suggests that all linear physical fields possess analogous topologically non - trivial field configurations .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : spinn ] by giving the spin-@xmath0 analogue of the em hopfion . in section  [ sec : spin1 ] we show that for @xmath1 this reproduces exactly the em hopfion of ref . @xcite . in section  [ sec : spin2 ] the spin-2 solution is analyzed within the framework of gravito - electromagnetism @xcite .",
    "we decompose the weyl tensor into spatial gravito - electric and gravito - magnetic tensors and characterize their evolution in terms of the em hopfion .",
    "although this article does not concern novel results in twistor theory itself , it will be beneficial to those readers unfamiliar with twistor theory to be exposed to a summary of those aspects of the formalism that are relevant for this article .",
    "this material is mainly placed in the appendix and some is reviewed in the following section for clarity .",

    "however , equation ( [ eqn : twistor_helicity ] ) as it stands simply specifies the helicity associated to the momentum structure encoded in @xmath13 . in order to convert the helicity into an operator from which we may deduce eigenfunctions , we must first quantize @xmath2 .",

    "classical electromagnetism resides in the spin-1 sector of equation ( [ eqn : spinnfield ] ) @xcite with source - free field equation and field strength spinor given by @xmath40 the standard electric and magnetic fields are recovered by decomposing @xmath27 using a 4-velocity @xmath41 so that @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the hodge dual .",

    "linearized general relativity makes up the spin-2 sector of the spin-@xmath0 equations @xcite .",
    "the field equation and associated field strength spinor are given by @xmath52 in analogy with the spin-1 case , following maartens @xcite et al . and nichols et al .",
    "@xcite , we decompose the weyl tensor using a 4-velocity @xmath41 into a tidal ( gravito - electric ) field and frame - drag ( gravito - magnetic ) field , @xmath53 taking @xmath44 we define the spatial tensors @xmath54 the symmetric traceless tensors @xmath55 and @xmath56 are called tidal and frame - drag fields since two orthogonal observers separated by a small spatial vector @xmath57 will experience a relative tidal acceleration given by @xmath58 and a gyroscope at the tip of @xmath57 will precess with angular velocity @xmath59 relative to inertial frames at the tail of @xmath57 . since the tidal and frame - drag fields are symmetric and traceless , each may be characterized entirely by its eigenspaces .",
    "thus , if @xmath60 is an eigenvector of @xmath61 or @xmath62 then the integral curves of @xmath60 are the gravitational analog of field lines . the tidal field stretches or compresses objects , and its associated field lines are referred to as tendex lines .",
    "the frame - drag field rotates gyroscopes , and its associated field lines are referred to as vortex lines .",
    "the tidal field has an associated eigenvalue @xmath63 which has a physical interpretation given by the tidal acceleration equation ( [ eqn : tidal_acceleration ] ) .",
    "thus , if the tendex eigenvalue is negative ( respectively , positive ) then an object oriented along the tendex line is stretched ( compressed ) along the tendex line .",
    "similar relations hold for the frame - drag field whose eigenvalues are interpreted using equation ( [ eqn : gyroscope_precession ] ) , where an object oriented along a vortex line observes counter - clockwise ( clockwise ) precession of gyroscopes around the vortex line .    the gravito - electromagnetic hopfion ( gem hopfion ) is constructed in the same fashion as the em hopfion since linearized gravitational fields are taken to be spin-2 fields on @xmath64 .",
    "thus , taking @xmath65 in equation ( [ eqn : spinn_knot ] ) , we have @xmath66 where @xmath38 defines the totally degenerate principle null directions of @xmath28 making it a petrov type n linearized gravitational field . taking the dual twistors @xmath67 and @xmath68 to be the same as in the em hopfion we construct the weyl curvature from equation ( [ eqn : weyl_spinor ] ) .",
    "then we perform the gravito - electric and gravito - magnetic decompositions as in equation ( [ eqn : spatial_tensors ] ) .",
    "the tidal and frame - drag fields are characterized by their spectral decomposition which provides a three dimensional picture of the spacetime via the integral curves of their eigenvector fields and their various physical interpretations , as in figure [ fig : shuttle ] . performing the spectral decomposition we find that both fields possess an eigenvalue structure @xmath69 corresponding respectively to the eigenvectors @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the positive eigenvalue which determines the field strength , for both the tidal and frame - drag fields .",
    "considering first the eigenvector fields which correspond to the zero eigenvalue , we find that @xmath73 which is , up to an overall scaling function , the poynting vector of the em hopfion .",
    "constructing riemann - silberstein structures for the remaining fields @xmath74 we find that @xmath75 where @xmath76        this defines the tidal and frame - drag fields in terms of the em hopfion .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : rs1 ] ) shows that the frame - drag field is a rotation of the tidal field about the poynting vector of the em hopfion .",
    "thus in passing to spin-2 we obtain two independent gravitational hopfion structures : a gravito - electric hopfion and a gravito - magnetic hopfion which differ simply by a global rotation .",
    "equations ( [ eqn : rs2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : theta ] ) show that the tidal field is a local duality transformation of the em hopfion . at @xmath77 , @xmath78 and thus provides no duality transformation .",
    "hence the tendex structure of the tidal field is the same as the field line structure of the em hopfion .",
    "furthermore , the vortex lines are the same as the tendex lines but rotated by @xmath79 in the @xmath80-plane .",
    "ergo , the @xmath77 tendex and vortex configuration is given by the six hopf fibrations of figure [ fig : time0 ] ( rows 2 and 3 ) so that for each fixed eigenvalue the associated tendex ( vortex ) lines are closed and linked exactly once .",
    "for @xmath81 , @xmath82 is complex and hence the tendex lines differ from those of the em hopfion by a local duality transformation as shown in figure [ fig : time1 ] with the vortex structure different again by only a rotation of @xmath83 .    for electromagnetic fields , there are two quantities that are invariant under local duality transformations : the energy density and poynting vector . for the em hopfion ,",
    "these are given in equations ( [ eqn : emenergy ] ) and ( [ eqn : empoynting ] ) . in direct analogy with the local duality invariants of electromagnetism",
    ", a covariant super - energy density and super - poynting vector that are invariant under a local duality transformation can be defined @xcite .",
    "for the gem hopfion , we find the super - energy density and super - poynting vector are given by @xmath84 there is a striking similarity between the local duality invariants for the spin-1 and spin-2 cases , which differ only by the power of the scalar factor which shows the energy falls off more rapidly for the higher spin fields .",
    "according to robinson , for each null shear - free geodesic congruence in minkowski space there exists a null solution of maxwell s equations @xcite . indeed",
    ", it has recently been shown using kerr s theorem that the em hopfion is derivable via the method of robinson @xcite .",
    "here we took a closer look at the fundamentals of twistor theory and showed that the em hopfion represents the simplest non - trivial classical solution to the spin-1 massless field equation in twistor space .",
    "this enabled the extension of the spin-1 em hopfion solution to the spin-@xmath0 equations . taking the @xmath85 solution as a linearized weyl tensor and aided by the concept of tendex and vortex lines , recently developed for the visualization of solutions in general relativity , we investigated the physical properties of the @xmath85 gem hopfion and characterized its evolution in terms of the riemann - silberstein structure of the em hopfion .",
    "these results capitalize on of one of the greatest strengths of the twistor program .",
    "it is precisely the unifying power of the twistor philosophy , deeply connected with the concept of spin , which allows for such a physically sweeping generalization of an em radiation field to both matter and linearized gravitational fields .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge discussions with roger penrose while he was the lorentz chair at the university of leiden in the summer 2011 .",
    "this work is supported by marie curie ext - ct-042580 and nwo vici 680 - 47 - 604 .",
    "the fundamental relationship between relativistic @xmath8 2-spinors and light - like 4-vectors , as illustrated in figure [ fig : bloch ] , defines the spin geometry of minkowski space @xmath64 and underlies the entire twistor program laid out by penrose @xcite .",
    "one can think of twistor space @xmath2 as the total momentum space for massless particles @xcite in which the linear and angular momenta are combined into a single object called a twistor .",
    "this is accomplished by using their @xmath8 representations .",
    "it turns out that , combined , linear and angular momentum possess two spinorial degrees of freedom denoted by @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "since the linear momentum @xmath3 is light - like it can be decomposed as the flagpole @xmath88 of some spinor @xmath87 .",
    "the second spinor @xmath89 is related to the relativistic angular momentum @xmath4 in that @xmath90 and its conjugate represent the self - dual ( sd ) and anti - self - dual ( asd ) parts of @xmath4 respectively ( where the parentheses denote normalized symmetrization over the indices ) .",
    "the dependence of the momentum structure @xmath91 on the origin induces a position dependence in @xmath92 , making them spinor fields on spacetime defined by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the @xmath8 representation of the 4-vector @xmath95 given by @xmath96 the @xmath8 representation of a 4-vector allows an algebraic realization of the flagpole relation of figure [ fig : bloch ] where we associate with the spinor @xmath87 a light - like 4-vector @xmath97 , called its flagpole , which has coordinates defined by @xmath98        we now define a twistor @xmath6 as the momentum structure @xmath99 encoded in a kinematically related pair of 2-spinors @xmath100 such that    1 .",
    "the flagpole of @xmath10 represents a linear momentum @xmath101 and 2 .",
    "the symmetrized product @xmath102 and its conjugate represent respectively the sd and asd components of the angular momentum tensor , @xmath103    the kinematic pair @xmath104 comes together to yield a 4-dimensional complex object , called a twistor , with components @xmath105 which is commonly abbreviated @xmath9 .",
    "the twistor dual is given by @xmath106 and allows one to construct a very useful expression for the helicity associated to the momentum structure @xmath6 given by @xmath107 helicity provides for a natural geometric partition of @xmath2 into three parts , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , according to whether the helicity is positive , negative , or zero .",
    "twistors from @xmath110 are said to be null , otherwise they are non - null .",
    "only null twistors have a direct geometric correspondence with @xmath64 .",
    "twistor geometry in @xmath64 is determined by the vanishing of @xmath111 , yielding the incidence relation @xmath112 this relation can be solved for hermitian @xmath94 , and thus points in @xmath64 , only when @xmath6 is null . in that case",
    "the solution is @xmath113 for arbitrary real @xmath114 .",
    "the geometry of equation ( [ eqn : incidence_solution ] ) is shown in figure [ fig : twistorsminkowski ] and represents a light - like worldline in @xmath64 parallel to the flagpole of @xmath115 , which meets the lightcone of the origin along the flagpole of @xmath116 at the point @xmath117 .    for non - null twistors ,",
    "equation ( [ eqn : incidence_relation ] ) possesses no hermitian solutions , and thus its direct geometric interpretation is in terms of complexified minkowski space .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ fig : twistorsminkowski ] , we can obtain an indirect geometric correspondence by exploiting the more direct relation for null twistors .",
    "if @xmath118 is non - null then its dual @xmath67 is a plane in @xmath2 .",
    "this plane is uniquely defined by its intersection with @xmath110 and hence by the solution of the system @xmath119 by equation ( [ eqn : incidence_solution ] ) , each point in this intersection represents a null geodesic .",
    "the set of all null twistors in the intersection corresponds to a space - filling set of null geodesics in @xmath64 called the robinson congruence .",
    "if we project the tangent vector field of one of these congruences onto a hyperplane of constant @xmath120 then we find that it forms the tangent vector field of a hopf fibration .",
    "the integral curves of the vector field are a special family of circles which lie on a set of space - filling nested tori .",
    "each circle , called a villarceau circle , is linked with every other one exactly once , and the entire structure propagates with the speed of light along its axis of symmetry without deformation .",
    "in fact , it was the hopf structure of the robinson congruence which inspired penrose with the name `` twistor . ''",
    "the momentum correspondences , equations ( [ eqn : linear_momentum_correspondence ] ) and ( [ eqn : angular_momentum_correspondence ] ) , clearly possess @xmath121 invariance .",
    "yet the geometric correspondence defined by the incidence relation , equation ( [ eqn : incidence_relation ] ) , is projective .",
    "that is , a twistor @xmath6 multiplied by any non - zero complex number corresponds to the same object in @xmath64 as @xmath6 itself .",
    "this leads us to consider as most fundamental the projective twistor space @xmath122 defined as @xmath2 under the equivalence relation @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "the partitions of @xmath2 naturally extend to partitions of @xmath122 , denoted by @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 .",
    "the geometric correspondences are most succinctly characterized in terms of the partitions of @xmath122 , as shown in figure [ fig : projectivetwistors ] .     and @xmath64 .",
    "a point in either @xmath125 ( red ) or @xmath126 ( green ) corresponds to a robinson congruence in @xmath64 .",
    "an entire @xmath128 ( celestial sphere ) in @xmath127 ( blue ) corresponds to a point in @xmath64 .",
    "any two points which lie on a @xmath128 in @xmath127 correspond to light - like world - lines which lie on the lightcone of the point corresponding to that @xmath128 . ]",
    "the approach to twistor quantization proceeds in much the same way as in standard quantum theory .",
    "we first identify a set of canonical variables .",
    "next we impose commutation relations on these variables .",
    "once commutation relations are imposed , we fix a representation in which half of the variables become derivatives and the other half remain parameters . fixing this representation allows us to construct explicit equations for some observable of interest for which we can seek eigenfunctions parameterized by only one of the canonical variables .",
    "choosing @xmath6 and @xmath129 as our canonical variables , we impose the commutation relations @xmath130 & = [ \\overline{z}_\\alpha,\\overline{z}_\\beta ] = 0 , \\\\ [ z^\\alpha,\\overline{z}_\\beta ] & = \\delta^\\alpha_\\beta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while this may seem rather ad hoc , it turns out that these relations , under the momentum correspondences , equations ( [ eqn : linear_momentum_correspondence ] ) and ( [ eqn : angular_momentum_correspondence ] ) , induce the standard commutation relations between @xmath4 and @xmath131 which generate the poincar group . therefore , twistor quantization can be consistently viewed as total momentum quantization .    next , we are faced with a choice of representation @xmath132 or @xmath133 once a representation is chosen , the eigenfunctions are confined to be functions of only one of @xmath6 or @xmath134 .",
    "this is tantamount to specifying that the eigenfunctions be either holomorphic , @xmath135 or antiholomorphic , @xmath136 in the twistor parameter @xmath6 .",
    "following penrose @xcite we choose the holomorphic case defined by equations ( [ eqn : choicez ] ) and ( [ eqn : holomorphic ] ) .    for massless free fields , helicity is the only quantum number and so the dynamics is entirely determined by the eigenfunctions of the helicity equation ( [ eqn : twistor_helicity ] ) . polarizing to avoid factor ordering issues and converting to our chosen representation",
    ", we have that @xmath137 the operator @xmath138 is known as the euler homogeneity operator and its eigenfunctions satisfy @xmath139 we recognize equation ( [ eqn : holomorphic_helicity ] ) as representing a shifted euler homogeneity operator on twistor space , and thus its eigenfunctions are homogeneous twistor functions where the relation between the homogeneity @xmath18 and the eigenvalue @xmath19 is given by @xmath140    the penrose transform is an integral transform , dependent on helicity , which maps these holomorphic eigenfunctions onto sd and asd solutions of the spin-@xmath0 field equations on @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "since we are interested only in real fields , and thus fields whose sd and asd components are conjugate , we require only the penrose transform for positive helicity , @xmath23 where @xmath141 is a contour on the celestial sphere of @xmath24 ( figure [ fig : shuttle]b ) which separates the poles of @xmath142 .",
    "the result is a spinor field which satisfies the spin-@xmath0 massless field equation @xcite @xmath143    from equation ( [ eqn : homogeneity ] ) we see that the positive helicity eigenfunctions of equation ( [ eqn : holomorphic_helicity ] ) are twistor functions of negative homogeneity .",
    "the simplest twistor function which is homogeneous of degree @xmath21 is given by @xmath144 however , the penrose transform is manifestly an integral over the celestial sphere of figure [ fig : bloch]b and there must be at least two poles in order for the contour integral to be non - vanishing .",

    "consider the integral expression @xmath148 where @xmath142 given by @xmath149 is homogeneous of degree @xmath21 .",
    "now let @xmath150 , @xmath151 be dual twistors such that @xmath152 where @xmath153 .",
    "now @xmath154 introducing the canonical spin bases @xmath155 into the primed spin space @xmath156 we have that @xmath157 moreover , the relations @xmath158 imply that equation ( [ eqn : penrosetransform ] ) becomes an integral manifestly over @xmath128 .",
    "thus @xmath159 where @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 represent the projective coordinate and poles respectively .",
