    "the number of gluons is @xmath5 , whereas the number of quarks is @xmath6 , so gluons are much more prevalent than quarks .",
    "an analysis of the @xmath0-dependence of quark - gluon diagrams is required to define the large-@xmath0 limit of the theory .",
    "the leading @xmath0-dependence of quark - gluon diagrams can be determined by replacing the gluon gauge field @xmath7 in the adjoint color representation by a tensor @xmath8 with one lower index and one upper index in the fundamental color representation , as depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "when feynman diagrams are drawn using double line notation , the power of @xmath0 of a diagram is obtained by counting the number of closed quark loops since each quark loop implies an unconstrained summation over the color index of the quark , which produces a factor of @xmath0 .",

    "the @xmath0-dependence of meson amplitudes can be determined by studying quark - gluon diagrams .",

    "the coupling of @xmath12-mesons is given by the planar diagrams with @xmath12 meson insertions on the quark loop .",
    "there is a single factor of @xmath0 from the single quark loop of the diagram and @xmath12 factors of @xmath24 , so the @xmath12-meson coupling is @xmath25 . from this @xmath0 counting ,",

    "the number of quarks inside a large-@xmath0 baryon grows as @xmath0 in the large-@xmath0 limit , but the size of the baryon is governed by @xmath20 and remains fixed .",

    "witten realized that this situation could be described by a hartree approximation in which each quark in the @xmath0-quark bound state interacts with the average potential produced by the other @xmath6 quarks  @xcite . in the large-@xmath0 limit ,",
    "the hartree picture becomes exact , and each quark experiences the same average hartree potential .",
    "when @xmath0 is very large , the hartree hamiltonian for a large-@xmath0 baryon is given by the sum of @xmath0 identical quark hamiltonians @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the hamiltonian for any one quark in the baryon , and is @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the hartree hamiltonian is trivial for large @xmath0 , so instead of solving for the baryon many - body wavefunction , one can consider the much simpler problem of finding the wavefunction of a single quark .",
    "the baryon wavefunction is given by the product of @xmath0 identical quark wavefunctions , @xmath36 for the lowest - lying ground state baryons , all of the quarks are in the same rotationally invariant ground state solution of the hartree hamiltonian @xmath37 , and the @xmath0 quark wavefunctions are combined in an @xmath38-wave , so the baryon wavefunction reduces to @xmath39 note that the baryon wavefunction is totally antisymmetric in the @xmath0 color indices of the quarks , so it is totally symmetric in the bosonic wavefunctions @xmath40 of the quarks .",
    "the hartree hamiltonian can be given in closed form only for heavy quarks .",
    "however , one expects the qualitative picture and the large-@xmath0 power counting to remain valid for light quarks where the relativistic hartree equations are not known .",
    "a second picture of large-@xmath0 baryons is obtained by considering the weakly - coupled meson sector of large-@xmath0 qcd .",
    "it has been speculated that large-@xmath0 baryons are solitons  @xcite of the large-@xmath0 meson lagrangian @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an arbitrary polynomial of the meson fields @xmath43 .",
    "the skyrme model  @xcite is an explicit model realization of this idea using the chiral lagrangian for pseudoscalar pions .",
    "the soliton mass is order @xmath0 , but its size and shape is independent of @xmath0 . the large-@xmath0 couplings of mesons to baryons can be obtained by expanding the action in the meson functional integral @xmath44 about the baryon soliton configuration , and solving the linear equations of motion for the semiclassical meson field in the presence of a background baryon soliton  @xcite . the @xmath0-dependence of baryon - meson scattering amplitudes can be determined by studying quark - gluon diagrams .",
    "typical graphs which contribute to the process baryon + meson @xmath45 baryon + meson are given in fig .",

    "3(a ) , both mesons are inserted on the same quark line of the baryon , so the color structure of the quark lines is preserved .",
    "there are @xmath6 possible choices for the quark line with the meson insertions , and each meson couples to a quark - antiquark pair with amplitude @xmath24 , so the overall diagram is @xmath27 .",
    "alternatively , the two mesons can be inserted on two different quark lines of the baryon , as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) . in this case",
    ", a gluon must be exchanged between the two quark lines to transfer energy between the incoming and outgoing mesons .",
    "the gluon interchanges the colors of quarks , so color conservation requires the exchange of the two quark lines .",
    "there are @xmath46 possible choices for the pair of quark lines with meson insertions ; each meson insertion is accompanied by a factor of @xmath24 ; and the gluon exchange is proportional to @xmath47 , so the overall diagram is @xmath27 .",
    "the generalization to multimeson - baryon scattering amplitudes is straightforward . in general , the scattering amplitude for the process baryon + meson @xmath45 baryon + @xmath48 mesons is @xmath49 , since each additional meson in the scattering process reduces the scattering amplitude by a factor of @xmath24 .",
    "mesons are strongly coupled to baryons for large @xmath0 .",

    "there are @xmath6 possible choices for the quark line with the meson insertion , and the meson insertion is accompanied by a factor of @xmath24 , so the overall diagram is @xmath26 .",
    "instead , the quark line of the meson can be reinserted into the baryon at another position ( fig .",
    "this color rearrangement is mediated by the exchange of a gluon .",
    "there are @xmath50 possible choices for the pair of quark lines involved ; the meson insertion gives a factor of @xmath24 ; and the gluon exchange yields a factor of @xmath47 , so the overall diagram is @xmath26 .",
    "the large-@xmath0 power counting of vertices containing a single baryon and @xmath12 mesons is determined from the same quark - gluon diagrams analyzed for baryon - meson scattering amplitudes . a baryon coupling to @xmath12 mesons",
    "is @xmath49 , since each additional meson in a vertex is accompanied by a factor of @xmath24 .",
    "( note that the above large-@xmath0 power counting rules apply for a single quark flavor . for more quark flavors , one must keep track of the flavor of each quark line in the quark - gluon diagrams .",
    "the flavor content of the mesons and baryons places restrictions on which quark lines can be chosen for the meson insertions .",
    "if the baryon contains @xmath6 quarks of the relevant quark flavors , then the @xmath0 counting remains the same .",

    "the recent work on the baryon @xmath1 expansion distinguishes between group theoretic relations of the skyrme and quark models which are model - independent and true in large-@xmath0 qcd , and results which are model - dependent and not consequences of large-@xmath0 qcd .",
