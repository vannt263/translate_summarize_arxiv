    "systems containing few fermions are interesting by their own . from one side , they are analyzed because of their _ in principle _ importance , as for example providing lower bounds to the ground state energy of more complicated systems containing identical , but arbitrary high number of particles @xmath4 @xcite , lead to potentially valuable and non - perturbative information regarding the many - body behavior @xcite as demonstrated by @xcite , or directly relate to basic principles of quantum theory , as for example non - locality derived from entanglement in the four - particle case @xcite . from the other hand , experimental developments of the last years allow to confine small number of atoms in a trap and address directly their quantum state @xcite . on this background ,",
    "the few - fermion states have been intensively studied with focus on different aspects , as for example emergence possibilities of inhomogeneous condensate @xcite , effect of the coulomb interaction @xcite , or study of bound states @xcite .",
    "the investigations start in fact from the two - particle level @xcite , the three - particle cases abound for example in the study of the behavior in harmonic trap @xcite , development of effective theories @xcite , study of the efimov effect @xcite , characterization of contact parameters in 2d @xcite , behavior in 1d trap @xcite , or in describing quantum dot systems @xcite . besides experimental observations @xcite , theoretical investigations for the four - particle cases are also present , mostly by numerical descriptions using exact diagonalization @xcite , or effective theories @xcite .",
    "however , connected to , and originating from the search for techniques leading to non - approximated results for non - integrable systems in one @xcite , two @xcite , and three @xcite dimensions , also exact results are present for the four particle problem in the 2d square hubbard case @xcite , or hubbard ladders @xcite .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on 2d systems built up from periodic hexagonal repeat units , as encountered in honeycomb or graphene type of lattices , being interested to deduce valuable good quality information relating the effects of the interaction on the many - body behavior .",
    "one knows that in such systems , because of the coupling constant value , nor perturbative expansions , nor strong coupling theories are properly justified @xcite , but in the same time , in the study of graphene type of materials , a strong need of non - perturbative input is present @xcite .",
    "furthermore , controversies relating the differences in the caused effects of the interaction in 2d systems with square and hexagonal repeat units @xcite also demand good quality input relating interaction driven many - body effects in these systems .    starting from these requirements , in the present paper we present exact four - particle ground states for 2d honeycomb samples with periodic boundary conditions taken in both directions .",
    "the method @xcite is based on deducing a small subspace @xmath0 containing the @xmath1 ground state wave function in exact terms , followed by the non - approximated calculation of different ground state characteristics .",
    "the technique itself starts from a wave vector @xmath5 containing the most interacting particle configuration translated to each site of the lattice and added .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath2 acting on the vector @xmath5 generates vectors @xmath6 with similar properties ( i.e. a local particle configuration taken at each site and added ) , and the linear system of equations closes in itself @xmath7 after a number of steps much less than the dimensionality of the full hilbert space .",
    "this generates the subspace @xmath0 containing the exact ground state .",
    "the method in principle can be applied independent on the system size and independent on the fixed number of identical particles inside the system .",
    "the results are interesting not only because provide in 2d honeycomb systems an exact four particle ground state which has its fingerprint in more complicated ground states holding an arbitrary high number of particles n @xcite .",
    "the results are also important because in the last years , procedures generating limited functional spaces based on the system in ( [ eq0 ] ) cut after a given number of steps ( i.e. using an incomplete @xmath0 basis ) , started to be used in different approximations and numerical approaches @xcite , for which , exact results could provide an important insight .    turning back to the deduced exact four particle ground state ,",
    "the results show that the ground state of the system is a total spin singlet @xmath8 state which has a ground state energy @xmath9 that interestingly saturates at a finite value , for increasing interaction strength , in the @xmath3 limit .",
    "furthermore , @xmath1 has a special property not present in the 2d square hubbard system , namely that the emergence probability of different particle configurations in the ground state wave function present trembling ( `` zittern '' ) in function of @xmath10 .",
    "because of this , small modifications in the interaction strength in 2d honeycomb systems could cause main changes in the many - body behavior , which underlines differences in the many - body effects of the interaction in 2d lattices with hexagonal and square repeat units ,    the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows : section ii . presents the studied system , section iii . describes the method and the deduced four - particle ground state , section iv .",
    "describes the observed properties of the ground state , section v. contains the discussions and summary , while finally , two appendices a , and b containing mathematical details close the presentation .",
    "in order to analyze the four - electron problem in a graphene type of system , one takes a two dimensional array of periodically displaced hexagons with equivalent sites , cutting from this @xmath11 neighboring hexagons and treating them with a hubbard type of model and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a such kind of system becomes in fact a torus with @xmath12 hexagons displaced along the ring of the torus ( i.e. along the toroidal direction ) and @xmath13 hexagons along the poloidal direction , providing the thickness ( i.e. the ring circumference ) of the sectioned torus ring .",

    "@xcite , it was shown that for @xmath28 electrons and @xmath29 sites , for which the hilbert space dimensionality is @xmath30 , the subspace @xmath0 containing @xmath1 has only the dimension @xmath31 .",
    "hence , in the process of deducing @xmath1 for the square system in ref.@xcite , working in @xmath0 instead of @xmath27 , one has a 170 times of dimensionality reduction ( i.e. two orders of magnitude ) .",

    "the @xmath10 value is expressed in @xmath71 units.,width=302,height=241 ]    comparing the results deduced for hexagonal repeat units with the case of the square lattice ( see figs.16 - 18 ) , one observes that the decrease of the @xmath91 coefficients in function of @xmath10 remains , but the trembling is missing , and the maximum disappears .",
    "the trembling ( `` zittern '' in german language ) is known mostly because of the trembling motion ( `` zitterbewegung '' ) of the dirac electron , namely the trembling of the relativistic electron velocity ( hence also the electron position ) in function of time @xcite observed by schrdinger ( see for the original derivation ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however , it is clear that trembling is not connected to relativity , since can occur also in classical wave propagation phenomena @xcite .",
    "in the present case the trembling occurs not in a time dependent phenomenon , but in the @xmath10 dependence of the emergence probability @xmath91 of a particle configuration @xmath23 described by the state vector @xmath6 present in the ground state .",
    "the trembling appears ( as in the dirac electron case ) because of an interference between two states influencing each other in the frame of the concrete event ( particle and antiparticle states in zitterbewegung of dirac electrons ) . in the present case",
    "the interference is caused by the proximity of two states on the energy scale . in order to check this statement , if one calculates the @xmath104 quantity taking @xmath105 from @xmath86 , @xmath85 ,",
    "one finds a continuous ( i.e. trembling free ) behavior , as observed from fig.19 .",
    "as seen from figs.16 - 19 , for relatively small u values , an oscillatory contribution is present in trembling ( such behavior is present also in the relativistic zitterbewegung ) , whose period is close to the @xmath71 value ( note that u is measured in t units ) , but this is transient , since disappears in @xmath3 limit ( see for example the high u region of fig.14 ) .",
    "we note that if @xmath86 , @xmath85 describe a rigorously degenerate state , the described trembling behavior remains present in a realistic system .",
    "this is because even under the action of an infinitesimally small perturbation , the degeneracy is broken ( see for example the case of a short ranged impurity @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , let us consider @xmath105 , @xmath85 , the coefficients of the particle configuration @xmath23 described by the state vector @xmath6 in the degenerate ground state @xmath86 .",
    "one knows that @xmath105 are trembling , but as observed from fig.19 , the function @xmath106 defined by @xmath107 is a continuous non - trembling ( i.e. possessing continuous u derivative ) function .",
    "then , from the stationary degenerate perturbation theory one knows that the emerging non - degenerate ground state @xmath1 becomes a linear combination of @xmath86 vectors with fixed prefactors .",
    "hence in @xmath1 , the vector @xmath6 has the coefficient @xmath108 , where k is fixed , and is explicitly determined by the degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "it depends in fact on the matrix elements of the perturbation expressed in terms of the non - perturbed eigenstates belonging to the degenerate level .",
    "it can be seen that because of ( [ eq9 ] ) , in @xmath109 the trembling will be automatically preserved .",
    "the deduced results show that , contrary to square lattices , in 2d systems with hexagonal repeat units strong variations in the system are possible to appear following small , even infinitesimal modifications in the value of the interaction .",
    "given by this property , the interaction dependent behavior of a honeycomb system as graphene could substantially differ from the behavior of a square lattice , even for concentrations which place far away the fermi level from the dirac points .",
    "such in principle differences in the behavior could cause controversies as encountered in refs.[@xcite ] .",
    "one notes that the presented technique can be applied also in the presence of non - local interactions . on this line",
    "we expect that density - density type of non - local interactions essentially will not modify the observed properties .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of local interactions , the brick - wall lattice ( see for example ref.[@xcite ] ) at @xmath97 has the spectrum of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "taking next - nearest neighbor hoppings into account , differences appear relative to the honeycomb case , because @xmath110 must be defined instead of a single next - nearest neighbor @xmath111 hopping term .",
    "however , we do not expect that this difference will alter in main aspects the behavior described in this paper .",
    "we deduced the exact interacting four particle ground state of a 2d finite sample described by a hubbard type of model and build up from hexagon repeat units .",
    "the ground state is obtained exactly from a restricted space @xmath0 with dimensionality much smaller than the dimension of the full hilbert space @xmath27 of the problem , @xmath112 .",
    "the used technique begins from a starting wave vector @xmath5 containing the most interacting particle configuration ( i.e. two nearest neighbor double occupancies ) translated to all sublattice sites and added ) .",
    "the application of the hamiltonian ( @xmath2 ) on @xmath5 leads to further vectors @xmath6 with similar properties , i.e. a local particle configuration translated to different sites and added .",
    "taken together , the @xmath113 equalities build up a closed system of linear equations for @xmath114 , whose minimum energy solution represents the ground state .",
    "we note that the ground state was always found a non - magnetic singlet state .    with the exact ground state in hands , different properties of the system",
    "have been analyzed .",
    "we have found that contrary to expectations , the singlet ground state energy saturates in the limit of infinite on - site coulomb repulsion , and the emergence probability of different particle configurations in the ground state presents trembling ( `` zittern '' ) in function of @xmath10 , this property being absent in the case of a square lattice .",
    "the trembling behavior has been shown to appear because of the interference between states placed in the proximity of each other on the energy scale .",
    "it can lead to strong modifications of the system properties caused by small variations of the interaction strength , and can be the source of the differences in the interaction dependent behavior of square and honeycomb 2d systems .",
