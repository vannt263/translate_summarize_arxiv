    "we can rewrite our optimization problem as follows : @xmath292 the numerical solution to this optimization problem gives us the estimator @xmath293 to get an idea about the speed of convergence to the limiting distribution in ( [ toillustrate ] ) we simulate @xmath294 risk estimators @xmath295 for a given sample size @xmath253 and draw their histogram .",
    "the number of bins for the histogram is determined by the rough  squared root of the sample size \" rule .",
    "this histogram is superimposed to the @xmath296 density .",
    "as @xmath253 is increased , our theory suggests that the histogram and the normal density graph will look more and more similar in shape .",
    "their closeness indicates how quickly the central limit theorem pops up in this case .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that the central limit theorem indeed represents a very good approximation which improves significantly with increasing sample size .",
    "the small downward bias that appears in figure 1 a ) is getting increasingly irrelevant with growing sample size .",
    "we have experimented with different values of @xmath5 such as @xmath297 and @xmath298 and we have also changed the value of @xmath299 ( respectively @xmath300 ) . the tendency shown in figure [ fig1 ] is largely upheld , however , as expected , the standard errors are increased when @xmath301 and/or @xmath5 is increased .",
    "also , the limiting normal approximation seems to be more accurate for the same sample sizes when a smaller value of @xmath5 is used .",
    "this discussed effect is illustrated on figure [ fig3 ] where @xmath151 ( i.e. , the case of avar ) , @xmath302 @xmath303 ( where a different sample in comparison to the sample in figure [ fig1 ] , ) and @xmath304 was simulated ) .",
    "the remaining quantities have been kept fixed to @xmath305 and @xmath286 we stress that increasing the sample size in figure [ fig3 ] d ) makes the histogram look much more like the limiting normal curve so that the discrepancy observed there is indeed just due to the limiting approximation popping up at larger samples when @xmath5 is increased .",
    "we also experimented with different distributions for the random variable @xmath306 we took specifically @xmath307-distributions with degrees of freedom @xmath308 such as 4 , 6 , 8 and 60 , shifted to have the same mean of 10 like in the normal simulated data .",
    "the results of this comparison for @xmath309 and @xmath310 are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the variances of the @xmath307-distributed variables , being equal to @xmath311 are finite and even smaller than the variance of the normal random variable in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "however the heavier tails of the @xmath307 distribution adversely affect the quality of the approximation . despite the fact that the limiting distribution of the risk estimator is still normal when @xmath312 and @xmath313 the heavy tailed data cause the normal approximation to be relatively poor even at @xmath314 the case @xmath315 is closer to normal distribution and hence the approximation works better in this case .",
    "note that the limiting distribution when @xmath303 involves the fourth moment of the @xmath307 distribution and this moment is finite for @xmath316 and @xmath317 but is infinite when @xmath318 as a result , it can be seen from figure [ fig2 ] d ) that the normal approximation collapses in this case .",
    "also , figure [ fig2 ] shows that for attaining similar quality in kolmogorov metric for the asymptotic approximation like in the case of normally distributed @xmath319 in figure 1 c ) , much bigger samples are needed .",
    "for the fixed sample size of 4000 , the quality of the normal approximation worsens as @xmath308 decreases from 60 to 8 and then to 6 .",
    "furthermore , and outside of the scope of the present paper , we note that if the distribution of @xmath1 has even heavier tails than the @xmath307 distribution with ( for example , if it is in the class of stable distributions with stability parameter in the range ( 1,2 ) ) then the limiting distribution of the risk may not be normal at all .",
    "the infinity dimensional delta method is a standard statistical technique to evaluate the asymptotic distribution of estimators of statistical functionals .",
    "the applicability of the procedure hinges on veryfing smoothness conditions of the related functionals .",
    "motivated primarily by the need to estimate coherent risk measures we introduce a general composite structure for such functionals in in which all known coherent risk measures can be cast .",
    "the potential applicability of our central limit theorems however extends beyond functionals representing coherent risk measures .",
    "our short simulation study indicates that the central limit theorem - type approximations are very accurate when the sample size is large , @xmath5 is in reasonable limits between 1 and 3 and the distribution of @xmath1 is with not too heavy tails .",
    "we note that for smaller sample sizes , the technique of concentration inequalities may be more powerful and accurate when evaluating the closeness of the approximation .",
    "it is possible to derive concentration inequalities for estimators of statistical functionals with the structure that has been introduced in our paper .",
