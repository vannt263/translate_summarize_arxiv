    "entanglement in many - body spin systems is a topic of high interest @xcite where  quantum correlations \" or long range entanglement between individual spins is notoriously difficult to achieve .",
    "here we propose to generate such entanglement through a non - perturbative dynamical mechanism which requires only a _ minimal action _ on a spin chain , namely a sudden quench of a single bond .",
    "we consider spin chains with a magnetic impurity @xcite located at one end ; under certain conditions , the ground state of the chain is such that the impurity is maximally entangled to the block of spins forming the kondo cloud ( kc ) @xcite .",
    "we will show that , during the dynamics induced by the quench , it is the kondo cloud which mediates entanglement between the two ending spins of the chain .",
    "the generated entanglement is measurable through two spin correlations and enables a direct detection of the presence of a kc within the system before quenching .",
    "this is important since , despite several manifestations , the direct observation of a kc is still an open challenge @xcite . besides being a quantum informational tool for probing a condensed matter paradigm ,",
    "the long range entanglement created by local quenching is _ substantial _ and potentially useful for linking separated quantum registers @xcite .",
    "though entanglement in condensed matter systems is typically very short ranged @xcite , there have been a few other proposals for long distance entanglement  however they come at a high price .",
    "for example , there are proposals exploiting weak couplings of two distant spins to a spin chain @xcite , which have limited thermal stability or very long time - scale of entanglement generation .",
    "otherwise , a dynamics has to be induced by large - scale changes to the hamiltonian of a system @xcite , as opposed to the minimal change required in our proposal .",
    "additionally , the exploitation of a non - perturbative cooperative feature of a condensed matter system , such as a kondo cloud , has not been addressed so far .",
    "quantum spin chains allow to investigate non - perturbative phenomena arising from the presence of impurities @xcite .",
    "for instance , the spin chain kondo model @xcite arises when a magnetic impurity @xcite is coupled to the end of an antiferromagnetic @xmath0 spin-1/2 chain , where @xmath1 is the ( next ) nearest neighbor coupling .",
    "the model supports a crossover from a gapless kondo regime ( kr ) for @xmath2 to a gapped dimerized regime ( dr ) for @xmath3 .",
    "it is called a kondo model since the impurity spin forms , in the kr , an effective singlet with a the spins inside the kc . recently",
    ", the entanglement of the ground state of this system has been characterized by varied means @xcite .",
    "the kondo spin chain is described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the vector of pauli operators at site @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xmath8 is the anti ferromagnetic ( next ) nearest neighbor coupling constants ( we always put @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 is the impurity bond strength and @xmath11 is the number of spins , which we assume to be even through this paper .",
    "@xmath12 is the initial hamiltonian of our dynamical scheme .",
    "tuning @xmath13 enables one to shift the spin chain between the kondo and drs .",
    "we consider the _ finite _ kondo chain ( [ hamil_nnn ] ) in its ground state @xmath14 .",
    "we , then , pertinently quench the coupling at the opposite end of the impurity allowing for the dynamics to develop entanglement .",
    "we show that , in the kr , the entanglement between the two ending spins oscillates between high peaks with a periodicity determined by @xmath15 , while the dynamics is very fast ( thereby decoherence hardly gets time to act ) and is robust against thermal fluctuations . in the dimer phase ,",
    "the dynamics is much slower , qualitatively different and , in finite chains , it generates some entanglement due to unavoidable end to end effects , which are drastically tamed if one `` cuts off '' the impurity from the chain during the dynamics . in the kr",
    ", cutting off the impurity has minimal effect on the final entanglement between the ending spins since , here , the process is mediated by the cloud .",
    "entanglement is expected to be very different @xcite as @xmath13 crosses @xmath16 since , for @xmath17 , there is a characteristic length - the so called kondo screening length @xmath18 - determined only by @xmath15 through @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a constant . in the kr , for any given @xmath15 and @xmath11 , @xmath18 determines the size of a domain whose spins are maximally entangled with the impurity spin sitting at the origin @xcite .    initially , the system is assumed to be in the ground state @xmath14 of @xmath12 .",
    "a minimal quench modifies only the couplings of the @xmath11th spin by the amount @xmath15 ( same as @xmath15 in eq.([hamil_nnn ] ) ) so that @xmath12 is changed to @xmath21 since @xmath14 is not an eigenstate of @xmath22 it will evolve as @xmath23 an entanglement @xmath24 between the ending spins emerges as a result of the above evolution . to compute @xmath24",
    ", we first obtain the reduced density matrix @xmath25 of spins @xmath26 and @xmath11 by tracing out the remaining spins from the state @xmath27 .",
    "then , we evaluate @xmath24 in terms of a measure of entanglement valid for arbitrary mixed states of two qubits called the concurrence @xcite .",
    "entanglement takes its maximum @xmath28 at an optimal time @xmath29 and an optimal coupling @xmath30 such that @xmath31 .",
    "as we shall see @xmath30 is not a perturbation of @xmath32 and @xmath13 .",
    "if , as expected from scaling in the kr @xcite , the dependence on @xmath11 and @xmath33 can be accounted for by a redefinition of @xmath15 ( equivalently @xmath18 ) , then @xmath29 and @xmath30 can not be independent quantities .",
    "our numerical analysis shows indeed that , in the kr , @xmath34 and that @xmath30 yields @xmath35 ; since @xmath19 one gets @xmath36 .    for our choice of @xmath37 and",
    "@xmath13 the spin - chain dynamics is not analytically solvable and one has to resort to numerical simulations .",
    "recent methods of many - body simulations allow handling exponentially big hilbert spaces with pertinent truncations . here , for @xmath38 , we use the time - step targeting method , based on the dmrg algorithm introduced in @xcite . for @xmath39 ,",
    "instead , we resort to exact diagonalization .    ) and dimer ( @xmath40 ) regimes .",

    "[ fig1](a ) shows that fast long - lived ( non - decaying ) periodic oscillations with a period of @xmath44 characterize the time evolution in the kr and that the maximal entanglement is achieved when the impurity coupling @xmath15 equals the value @xmath30 associated to a kc of size @xmath35 ( the kc generated by the impurity sitting on the left side touches the other side of the chain ) ; in the dr the dynamics appears more dispersive and not oscillatory for any @xmath15 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) we plot the maximum of entanglement , @xmath28 , induced by bond quenching as a function of the length @xmath11 : though the entanglement decreases as @xmath11 increases , its value , in the kr , stays rather high and becomes almost _ distance independent _ for very long chains ; furthermore , as @xmath11 increases , the entanglement generated in the kr is significantly bigger than the one in the dr . despite its lower value ,",
    "achieving entanglement in the dr costs more time , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "it is also clear from fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) that @xmath29 increases by @xmath11 linearly .",
    "finally , in the kr , @xmath30 slowly decreases as @xmath11 increases while it stays essentially constant in the dr ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ) .",
    "this is commensurate with the expectation that @xmath45 in the kr , while , in the dr , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are two independent quantities .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a shows the exponential dependence of @xmath29 on @xmath46 realized , in the kr , for long enough chains .",
    "how the dynamics creates - even for very long chains of size @xmath11- high entanglement oscillations between the ending spins of the chain in the kr ? to understand this , one should recall that , in the kr , the impurity spin forms an effective singlet with all the spins inside the cloud @xcite and that , only in this regime , one can always choose @xmath15 so that @xmath18 may be made comparable with @xmath11 ; at variance , in the dr , the impurity in @xmath14 picks out - no matter what the values of @xmath15 and @xmath11 are- only an individual spin in the chain to form a singlet ( a valence bond ) while the remaining spins form singlets ( _ local dimers _ ) with their nearest neighbors @xcite .",
    "thus , only in the kr , one may use the remarkable resource to select - for any @xmath11- an initial state @xmath14 which is free from local excitations : in fact , when @xmath35 ( @xmath47 ) there is only a _ _ s__ingle entity , namely the @xmath11th spin , interacting with the impurity - cloud composite .",
    "as this situation can always be engineered by choosing , for any @xmath11 , @xmath47 , this explains the distance - independent entanglement in fig .",
    "the proposed scenario provides an intuitive grasp on why , only in the kr , an optimal entanglement between the ending spins may emerge from quench dynamics as the result of the interplay between very few states . at variance , in the dr , the energy released by quenching is dispersed over the variety of different quantum modes associated to the local dimers .    to provide a more quantitative analysis",
    ", one may expand @xmath27 in terms of eigenvectors of @xmath22 . by exact",
    "diagonalization ( up to @xmath48 ) , one finds that , in the kr , only two eigenstates of @xmath22 ( the ground state @xmath49 and one excited state @xmath50 ) predominantly contribute to the dynamics : @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eigenvectors ] ) the first and the last spin are projected onto the singlet ( @xmath52 ) and the triplets ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) while the states of all spins in the body of the chain have been specified by the index @xmath55 . after a time @xmath33 the state evolves as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the energy separation between the two levels .",
    "one defines @xmath58 as the time for which the contribution of @xmath59 is most enhanced in @xmath27 due to a _",
    "constructive interference_.    the condition for the onset of constructive interference is latexmath:[\\[\\label{interference }    terms other than @xmath59 in @xmath27 do not contribute at @xmath58 .",
    "when @xmath61 ( very small cloud ) then @xmath62 while @xmath63 as the ground state is hardly changed on quench : thus , constructive interference between @xmath49 and @xmath50 it is impossible .",
    "the condition of eq .",
    "( [ interference ] ) can not be satisfied also when @xmath64 , since one has now that @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( the end spins form a singlet and triplet with each other in @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively @xcite ) .",
    "thus , only for intermediate @xmath15 entanglement may peak .",
    "when @xmath67 ( @xmath68)- and particularly for @xmath69- the entanglement between the ending spins is frustrated by the existence of local excitations whose number increases as the size of the cloud gets smaller .",
    "in addition , when @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , the kc overtakes the chain and the @xmath11th spin is already _ included in the cloud _ and its tendency is to screen the original impurity as in @xmath59 rather than to pair with it to form a spin one ( as in the last three terms of @xmath49 ) .",
    "this makes @xmath72 quite small , and it becomes smaller as the cloud overtakes the chain and again the condition of eq .",
    "( [ interference ] ) can not be fulfilled .",
    "consequently , the optimal situation is realized when @xmath47 ( @xmath35 ) , i.e just before the cloud overtakes the chain .",
    "thus , only in the kr , one can convert - for any @xmath11- the _ useless entanglement _ between the impurity spin and the kc into a _ usable entanglement _ between the ending spins of the chain .",
    "the emerging long distance entanglement analyzed in this paper is , indeed , a genuine footprint of the presence of the kc in @xmath14 ( fig . [",
    "fig3](a ) ) .     vs. @xmath73 in the kr .",

    "[ fig2]b we plot- for both regimes- the entanglement reached after waiting for a time interval of the order of @xmath76 .",
    "one notices that , for @xmath3 , the entanglement peak decreases sensibly and goes to zero rather soon .",
    "the plot of the maximal entanglement vs. @xmath15 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c : here one sees that , in the kr , the entanglement rises from zero already at very small values of @xmath15 .",
    "this is expected since , in the kr , to a small @xmath15 is associated a large cloud containing the impurity sitting on the left side .    the essential role of the kc in the entanglement generation is further probed if one let evolve the ground state @xmath14 with a doubly quenched hamiltonian obtained from ( [ hamil_nnn_quenched ] ) by isolating ( i.e. , putting @xmath77 ) the left hand side impurity while keeping fixed to @xmath30 the bond connected to the last spin ( see fig . [ fig3]b ) .",
    "this forbids the dynamical build up of that  portion \" of the total entanglement which is only due to end to end effects . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we have plotted the @xmath28 vs. @xmath11 after double quenching in both regimes . fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that entanglement in the dimer phase collapses already when @xmath78 while it stays _ unexpectedly _ high - and almost independent on @xmath11 - in the kr ; the existing entanglement of the kc with the impurity @xcite is dynamically swapped over to the last spin .",
    "note that a long distance singlet between the end spins may be realized in a ground state when those spins are very weakly coupled ( @xmath79 ) to a spin chain @xcite .",
    "this static approach to generate entanglement relies on couplings which are so weak that they can merely be regarded as perturbations .",
    "such entanglement is not robust against thermal fluctuations due to the smallness of the gap ( @xmath80 ) between the ground state and a triplet state between the end spins . on the other hand",
    "our approach enables to generate entanglement dynamically even for @xmath15 as high as @xmath81 .",
    "even when temperature is increased , the entanglement is not seriously disrupted till @xmath82 exceeds the kondo temperature ( @xmath83 ) after which the kc does not form . as a result , while in the dynamical approach @xmath84 , in the static approach one has @xmath85 : thus , the long distance entanglement generated through the dynamical approach is thermally more stable .",
    "for instance , for @xmath86 , our dynamical approach is robust for temperatures 100 times higher than those required for the static approach . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d , we plot @xmath28- as obtained in both approaches- vs. temperature for @xmath75 . in the static approach ,",
    "the ground state is replaced by the thermal state , whereas in our dynamic approach it is the initial state which is taken to be the relevant thermal state .",
    "we ignore thermalization and relaxation during dynamics since the dynamical time scale , set by @xmath29 , is fast enough ( this is also an advantage over slow dynamical schemes with weak couplings @xcite ) .     for entanglement generation through quench dynamics .",

    "we have shown that substantial _",
    "long range distance independent _ entanglement can be engineered by a non - perturbative quenching of a _ single _ bond in a kondo spin chain .",
    "this is the first example where a _ minimal local _ action on a spin chain dynamically creates long range entanglement .",
    "in contrast to all known schemes for entanglement between individual spins in spin chains , here the entanglement attains a constant value for long chains rather than decaying with distance .",
    "we showed that , in the kr , the entanglement between the ending spins is mediated by the the kc .",
    "as the coupling is non - perturbative in strength ( @xmath81 ) , the entanglement generation is both fast and thermally robust . in the kr ,",
    "the entanglement is periodic in time with a period of @xmath44  this is a curious instance of exciting a long lived regular oscillation in a gapless system .",
    "both , the long distance entanglement mediated by the cloud and the periodic dynamics , provide a clear signature of the existence of the kc in a quantum system with impurities .",
