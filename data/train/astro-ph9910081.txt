    "after attending this conference , i think that everyone will agree that the subject of the origin of asymmetrical planetary nebulae , in particular the problem of the `` shaping '' , is a matter of passionate debates , probably because our current observational knowledge of the problem still leads to too many possible solutions . from our point of view , this lack of knowledge is partially due to that planetary nebulae ( pne ) themselves are not very good targets to study how this shaping process occurred .",
    "pne are too old in two senses . on the one hand , regarding the problem of the shaping , we can consider pne as mainly consisting in freely expanding gas : the interactions presently active do not bear information on the large - scale shaping process ( the origin of the axis - symmetry , etc . ) . on the other hand , when observing gas in pne , it is very difficult to detect more than just a little fraction of the total mass of the progenitor agb envelope : we do not probe the whole dynamics .",
    "one way to overcome these two difficulties is to study the objects in the phase between the agb and pn stage , the proto - pne ( ppne ) .",
    "since they are younger , one expects them to show features of the more recent shaping processes , that could be even still active .",
    "they also have the advantage of being rich in molecular content , because the central star is not hot enough to drive a strong photo - ionization in its envelope . due to this",
    ", mm - wave observations of the emission from co rotational lines can efficiently trace the bulk of the mass in the envelope .",
    "traditionally , this type of observations was of limited use because ppne are rare ( the ppn phase is very brief , it lasts less than 2000 yr ) , and therefore they are usually very far away and angularly small .",
    "now , with instruments like the iram plateau de bure ( pdb ) interferometer , we are able to image these sources with resolutions better than 1@xmath3 , providing simultaneously spectral resolutions better than 1  kms@xmath4 and total mass sensitivities of the order of 0.01  @xmath5 . here",
    "we summarize our results from the co mapping of several post - agb envelopes using pdb : m192 , m256 , oh231.8 + 4.2 , and 89her ( co maps of crl2688 are also presented by lucas et al@xmath6 in this volume ) . for oh231.8 + 4.2",
    "we have also mapped lines other than co ; these chemical studies are outlined in the contribution by snchez contreras et al@xmath6 in addition , we also present the preliminary results of a survey of co lines in post - agb sources , carried out with the iram 30  m radiotelescope .",
    "we want to stress here the importance of this type of studies to understand pn shaping .",
    "note that every pn was once a ppn , and that whatever the properties of these ppne were , models trying to reproduce the final stage of a certain pn should predict ppn stages similar to those we do observe .",
    "m192 is a bipolar ppn with a 20000  k central star , located 3  kpc away and with a luminosity of 10@xmath7 @xmath8 , that was known to show high velocity wings in molecular line emission .",
    "this is the object in which we started our mm - wave interferometric maps of ppne , and therefore , the one we have studied in more detail . in addition to the high resolution maps of @xmath1co and @xmath9co we are discussing here , we have performed detailed imaging in the optical and nir ( using the wfpc2 and nicmos2 on - board the hst ) , and continuum observations at 6 and 1.3  cm , and 2.6 and 1.3  mm ( alcolea et al@xmath6 1999 ) .    the co observations were conducted between 1993 and 1997 , using the pdb interferometer , reaching a spatial resolution better than 10 in the @xmath9co @xmath0=21 line ( see bujarrabal et al@xmath6 1994 , 1997 , 1998a ) .",
    "the quality of the data and the good spatial resolution in comparison with the total size of the nebula , 10@xmath3 , fully revealed the structure and kinematics of the molecular envelope , which consist of three main components ( fig.1a ) .",
    "the densest parts of the nebula lie in an equatorial disk ( or torus ) dividing the two reflecting lobes ; this equatorial structure is expanding radially , at a constant agb - like velocity of 8  kms@xmath4 . at both sides of this component ,",
    "the reflecting lobes are surrounded by two molecular shells , elongated along the symmetry axis of the nebula , and showing a constant velocity gradient ( 7.5  kms@xmath4 per @xmath3 ) in this direction .",
    "the walls of these shells are very thin ( 06 ) : the two shells are practically empty .",
    "the two lobes are ended by two high - velocity knots , moving at an expansion velocity of 70  kms@xmath4 along the axis . from the comparison of the different co lines ,",
    "we conclude that the kinetic temperature of the gas is very low , 1030  k.    the total mass of the neutral nebula detected by the co observations is 0.9  @xmath5 , i.e. , we are probably seeing the whole agb envelope , strongly modified during the post - agb evolution .",
    "we suggest that the present nebular configuration , which is only 900  yr old , derived from the `` constant '' velocity gradient .",
    "this hubble - like velocity field suggest that the interaction responsible for the present kinematics lasted much less than age@xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11  100200 yr ] , is due to some post - agb mass ejection , highly bipolar and very fast , which impinged on two opposite sites of the agb shell , accelerating and stretching it along the newly formed axis of symmetry , via a momentum ( quasi - isothermal ) driven shock . assuming that during the agb the nebula was spherically symmetric , and expanded at the velocity now only present in the thick equatorial disk , the axial momentum won by the envelope during the post - agb phase is 310@xmath12  grcms@xmath4 .",
    "this figure is nearly 10@xmath13 times the amount of momentum available from photon pressure since the post - agb interaction started .",
    "this result points out that not only the central star and the envelope change during the post - agb evolution . the mass loss mechanism and its source of energy should also change , since photon pressure can not account for the observed momentum .",
    "we have detected in sii and oi lines the present bipolar post - agb flow in m192 , as a chain of compact ( 02 ) knots along the symmetry axis inside the co empty shells ( bujarrabal et al@xmath6 1998b ) ; the momentum carried by this wind is now very small , not affecting the kinematics of the envelope , but we can not rule out that it were much larger in the past .",
    "m256 is also a ppn with a clear bipolar appearance in the optical , the axis of symmetry being oriented in the east - west direction .",
    "located @xmath14  3  kpc away , the central star shows a b0 ( 30000  k ) spectral type and a luminosity of 10@xmath7  @xmath8 .",
    "in addition to pdb 4@xmath3 to 2@xmath3 resolution maps of the @xmath1co @xmath0=10 and 21 emission , we have also performed spectro - imaging of optical lines tracing shocked excited gas .",
    "our co observations are still not finished ( there are some additional data to be taken ) and therefore their analysis is very preliminary",
    ". however , the main results outlined here should not change ( snchez contreras et al@xmath6 in prep . ) .    from the co maps",
    ", m256 looks quite similar to m192 , except that in the former , only the central parts of the nebula and the high velocity knots at both ends of the axis of symmetry are clearly detected .",
    "the two empty shells , characteristic of m192 , appear weak and very fragmented in this case ; they are mostly detected near the equatorial disk , which so resembles a sort of a flattened hourglass .",
    "because of this lack of molecular emission between the equator and the poles of the nebula , and also because the symmetry axis lies almost in the plane of the sky , the constant velocity gradient is not so conspicuous here .",
    "however , when taking into account projection effects , we also obtain large values for the velocity gradient along the symmetry axis , 8.5  kms@xmath4 per @xmath3 , the two high - velocity clumps escaping from the star at a velocity of 90  kms@xmath4 .",
    "as for m192 , the equatorial disk shows radial expansion with an agb - like velocity ( 815  kms@xmath4 ) .",
    "we have measured a total envelope mass of 0.1  @xmath5 , the corresponding axial momentum being 710@xmath15  grcms@xmath4 . from the velocity gradient",
    ", we estimate that m256 is twice older than m192 : age@xmath16 16002000  yr .",
    "this result agrees with other age indicators that also point out that m256 should be more evolved than m192 ; the bluer spectral type and the weaker co emission .",
    "in fact , the most likely explanation for the nearly absence of molecular emission in the lobe walls , is that , because of this aging , photo - dissociation by uv radiation has partially destroyed the molecular envelope .",
    "we conclude that m256 is an object very similar to m192 , and therefore originated in a similar way , but somewhat more evolved .",
    "in particular we suggest that the high - velocity knots detected in m256 , which are detached from the rest of nebula , could be progenitors of fliers .",
    "oh231.8 + 4.2 is a very peculiar ppn . in the optical and nir it shows a clear bipolar structure , but very asymmetric , the south lobe being more extended than the one in the north .",
    "the central star is also unique ; located @xmath14  1.5  kpc away and with a luminosity of 10@xmath7  @xmath8 , it consists of a m9iii mira variable and maybe a hotter companion ( it could be a symbiotic system ) . not surprisingly , this nebula is also very peculiar in molecular line emission , showing a very fast wind in co and a particularly rich chemistry .",
    "in addition to pdb @xmath1co high resolution maps , we have also performed interferometric observations of other molecular species ( see the contribution by snchez contreras et al@xmath6 ) , and ground based optical long - slit observations and nir imaging ( sanchez contreras et al@xmath6 1999 ; some beautiful nir images from the hst nicmos2 camera have been presented by bieging et al@xmath6 in this conference ) . by the end of this year , we will also have hst wfpc2 images of the nebula in various atomic lines .",
    "our pdb interferometric maps of @xmath1co @xmath0=10 and 21 are not so detailed as those of m192 ( partly because the low declination of the source ) , but are good enough as to show the structure of the nebula at a 2@xmath3 scale .",
    "the most outstanding feature of the molecular envelope is its shape ; the co nebula is extremely elongated , 1.610@xmath17  cm long ( along the symmetry axis ) but only 1.510@xmath18  cm across ( taking into account an inclination of this axis with respect to the line of sight of 5055@xmath19 ) .",
    "this distribution of matter agrees very well with the ground based nir images , but strongly contrasts with the optical picture , especially in the south lobe ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the kinematics of the molecular gas is dominated , once again , by the presence of a strong ( 8.9  kms@xmath4 per @xmath3 , deprojected ) and constant velocity gradient along the symmetry axis .",
    "we detect gas expanding up to 375  kms@xmath4 in the south ( 210  kms@xmath4 in the north ) : to our knowledge , this is the highest expansion velocity ever measured in molecular line emission from evolved stars .",
    "the total mass of the nebula is 0.51.0  @xmath5 , and the axial momentum carried by the molecular flow , which is 750 yr old , is 310@xmath12  grcms@xmath4 .",
    "although the most remarkable feature in the maps is the presence of the very elongated fast emission in both lobes , the central core of the nebula is not less important . because of the somewhat lower resolution attained for oh231.8 + 4.2 , the structure of the central parts of the nebula is not so clear .",
    "however , from the detailed inspection of the maps and its comparison with our first ( also with 2@xmath3 resolution ) observations of m192 , we conclude that the two objects are very similar : there is a compact component at the very center of the nebula , and two hollow shells at both sides of it ( fig.1b ; see also the discussion of the hco@xmath20 observations in the contribution by snchez contreras et al@xmath6 ) .",
    "therefore the main structural difference between the envelopes in m192 , m256 , and oh231 + 8 + 4.2 is that , in the latter , the two high - velocity knots have been replaced by two asymmetrical jets expanding a high velocity . in any case",
    ", we suggest that the origin of the bipolarity of all three cases should be similar . the presence of the long high velocity co jets in oh231.8 + 4.2 and not in the other two cases , could be due to differences in the details of the interaction responsible for the present shape ( degree of collimation of the post - agb jets , density contrast between the two colliding winds , etc . ) .",
    "the three objects just discussed provide many clues to investigate the origin of bipolar ppne and pne , suggesting a similar formation mechanism in all cases .",
    "however the sample is far from being statistically significant . because of the relatively small number of dishes per instrument and total collecting area , one of today s problems in high - quality imaging in mm - interferometry is that it is highly time consuming .",
    "typically , high quality imaging , like that performed in any of the four targets here presented , takes about 1.52.5 full days of observing time .",
    "given the large observing pressure in this type of instruments , to map a large ( statistically significant ) sample of sources results prohibitive in these days .",
    "( this situation may change drastically if instruments like the planned alma become available . ) to overcome these difficulties , we have carried out single dish observations , using the iram 30  m mrt , of a large number of ppne , to study the global properties of the high - velocity molecular emission that characterizes this type of objects .",
    "the resolution of the telescope , 12@xmath3 , does not allow to map the sources in almost all cases , but under certain assumptions , one can determine the mass , momentum , and kinetic energy of the high velocity outflow . to better estimate the effects of line excitation and opacity , we have simultaneously observed the @xmath0=10 and 21 lines of @xmath1co and @xmath9co .",
    "`` very preliminary '' results ( castro - carrizo et al@xmath6 in prep . ) of these observations are summarized in table1 .    in about 80% of the studied ppne",
    "we have found high - velocity co wings , with expansion velocities between 25 and 375  kms@xmath4 . the derived total envelope mass can be as large as 0.51.0  @xmath5 ; in these cases it is clear that we have detected the whole circumstellar envelope .",
    "the measured axial momentum is always very large : the co flows are `` hyper - luminous '' in the sense that the time required to obtain that momentum from photon pressure only ( age@xmath21 ) , 4000100000 yr , is larger than the expected duration of the ppn phase .",
    "this problem becomes more severe if we consider the kinetic age ( age@xmath10 ) of the flows in those objects in which it has been measured .",
    "we note that the age@xmath21 ",
    "@xmath22/(@xmath23/@xmath24 )  does not depend on the distance assumed for the source , which is the main source of uncertainty in all these computations .",
    ".summary of the results from the iram 30  m observations for sources showing high velocity molecular emission .",
    "figures are corrected for distance , opacity , and axial inclination .",
    "@xmath25 is the maximum expansion velocity measured in co ; @xmath26 is the total mass of the molecular envelope ; @xmath22 is the linear momentum along the axial directions ; age@xmath21 is the time required for the photon pressure to account for the axial momentum , i.e. @xmath22/(@xmath23/@xmath24 ) ; age@xmath10 is the kinetic age of the high velocity outflow when measured [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these results , in addition to those obtained from the high resolution maps of ppne ( bipolarity , relative high degree of collimation , absence of large scale rotation in the envelopes ) , impose very strong constrains for the possible mechanisms capable of powering these molecular ejections , that we believe are also the responsible for the shaping of bipolar and point symmetric pne .",
    "in fact , the large momentum and energy released in just a few hundred years rule out not only photon pressure , but probably all other mechanisms not powered by the accretion of material or by explosive nuclear reactions . on the other hand , the similitude between the post - agb high - velocity molecular flows and those in young stellar objects , suggests that maybe also here the accretion of material is the right answer .",
    "so far , our observations do not tell us anything about the collimation mechanism except that it must be very efficient : in the southern jet of oh231.8 + 4.2 the collimation factor is @xmath14  20 ; a similar number is found for the present post - agb mass loss in m192 .",
    "this object is the prototype of the so called luminous high - latitude stars ( lhl ) , which are though to represent the post - agb phase of low - mass stars , although maybe it can not be considered as a low - mass ppn , since it is not clear whether this type of objects will evolve into pne .",
    "89her is a f2ibe star ( 7000 k ) with a luminosity of 3300  @xmath8 for an estimated distance of 600 pc ( see alcolea & bujarrabal 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the star is a regular pulsator with a period of 60  d and , based on an additional 288 d period of its radial velocity , it is believed to be a close binary system ( waters et al@xmath6 1993 ) .",
    "the star was also known to present a strong ir excess due to a dusty circumstellar envelope , and a peculiar co profile consisting of a very narrow component ( fwhp @xmath14  3.5  kms@xmath4 ) plus weaker wings ( fwzp @xmath14  20  kms@xmath4 ) .",
    "we observed this object with pdb in 19941995 using 4 antennas and in the 3  mm band only .",
    "we mapped the @xmath1co @xmath0=10 line emission with a spatial resolution of @xmath14  4@xmath3 ( 2@xmath3 when using uniform weighting ) .",
    "the results of these observations are that the molecular envelope consists of two components : a compact core , only partially resolved by the observations , and a detached shell .",
    "both components show , in first approximation , spherical symmetry , in spite of that 89her is a close binary system ( see alcolea & bujarrabal 1995 ) .",
    "this result does neither support nor rejects binarity as responsible for the bipolarity in pne , but certainly supports the idea that maybe high - latitude ( low - mass ) objects are less likely to show strong deviations from spherical symmetry ( corradi & schwarz 1995 )      alcolea j. , & bujarrabal v. , 1995 , a&a 303 , l21 alcolea j. , & bujarrabal v. , 1999 , in iau symp .",
