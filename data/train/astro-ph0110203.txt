    "the explosive phenomenon of classical novae occurs on the surface of accreting white dwarfs , in close binary systems of the cataclysmic variable type , whenever certain initial conditions of white dwarf mass and luminosity and mass - accretion rate are met .",
    "the hydrogen - rich accreted matter , mixed with matter from the underlying white dwarf core , burns in degenerate conditions , leading to a thermonuclear runaway and the ensuing explosion .",
    "an important increase in visual luminosity and the ejection of a fraction of the accreted envelope are some of the consequences of the explosion .",
    "the outburst is accompanied by the release of gamma - rays , with different time scales .",
    "the prompt @xmath3-ray emission from classical novae has its origin in e@xmath4-e@xmath5 annihilation , with the positrons coming mainly from @xmath0n and @xmath1f decays ( see the pioneering work from @xcite ) .",
    "the positrons emitted by @xmath2na decay also contribute to the prompt emission , but with a much lower flux than those from @xmath0n and @xmath1f , because of its much longer decay time .",
    "in general , the released positrons annihilate and produce a line at 511 kev and a continuum below it .",
    "the continuum is produced both by the positronium emission ( when it is formed in triplet state ) and by the comptonization of the photons emitted in the line ; it has a cut - off at around 20 - 30 kev , because of photoelectric absorption ( this mechanism has larger cross - sections than compton scattering at low energies ) .",
    "the isotopes @xmath0n and @xmath1f have relatively short lifetimes , which makes the corresponding emission of short duration and tightly related to the conditions in the expanding envelope ( opacity to gamma - rays ) .",
    "the prompt gamma - rays from novae are emitted very early in the explosive phase , i.e. , before the maximum in visual luminosity and , therefore , before optical discovery for the majority of novae .",
    "there is another type of gamma - ray emission , related to line emission from the decay of medium - lived radioactive nuclei ( such as 478 kev from @xmath6be and 1275 kev from @xmath2na ) , lasting for months and years after the explosion , which has not been detected in any nova up to now @xcite , but its study is out of the scope of this paper ( see for instance the pioneering papers from @xcite , @xcite , and the recent ones from @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "complete evolution of various nova models ( both of the co and one type , depending on the chemical composition of the underlying white dwarf , which , in turn , depends on its core mass ) from the accretion phase up to the ejection one , has been computed , with a hydrodynamical code ( see @xcite , for details about the code ) .",
    "it is important to stress that some nuclear reaction rates play a very important role on the synthesis of the most relevant radioactivities in nova explosions . in particular ,",
    "@xmath1f synthesis is affected mainly by @xmath1f+p reactions ( @xmath1f(p,@xmath3 ) and @xmath1f(p,@xmath7 ) , which are still quite uncertain ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the final amount of @xmath1f , which almost directly translates into the flux of positron annihilation gamma rays emitted promptly , will be as close to reality as the measured nuclear cross sections are .",
    "it is also important to treat accurately the initial composition of the underlying white dwarf core , specially for the case of the one novae , as well as the amount of mixing between accreted and white dwarf matter ( see discussion in @xcite ) . in table",
    "[ radioac ] we show the radioactivities , relevant for the positron annihilation gamma rays , for a handful of computed nova models .",
    "one important result is that similar amounts of @xmath1f are produced in both nova types , contrary to what happens with other longer lived radioctivities ( i.e. , @xmath6be , mainly produced in co novae , and @xmath2na , mainly produced in one novae ) .",
    "the main properties of the emission of positron annihilation gamma rays from novae are displayed in figure [ lcannihil ] , where the time axis origin is at peak temperature ( which occurs before visual luminosity maximum ) . first we show ( figure [ lcannihil ] left ) the light curve of the 511 kev line , for the four models from table [ radioac ] .",
    "although the amount of ejected @xmath1f is similar in all the models , the less massive co nova ( 0.8 m@xmath8 ) emits a smaller flux than the other ones ; that s because its outer expanding shells move at smaller velocities and , therefore , are more opaque to gamma - rays .",
    "it is important to notice that there is also an initial peak in the light curves , related to @xmath0n decay , of even shorter duration than that produced by @xmath1f decay ( because of the shorter lifetime of @xmath0n as compared with @xmath1f ) .",
    "another interesting aspect is that in one novae the 511 kev line has a longer duration , because of the contribution of the positrons from @xmath2na - decay : a low - level `` plateau '' becomes visible at the tail of the light curve ( see figure [ lcannihil ] ) .",
    "however , when the envelopes finally become transparent ( one or two weeks after t@xmath9 ) e@xmath4 escape without annihilating .",
    "a similar behavior is displayed by the continuum light curves ( see figure [ lcannihil ] right ) ; here one can see that there is much more flux in the continuum than in the 511 kev line ( which has widths fwhm between 3 and 8 kev ) .",
    "other important factors , beyond the critical nuclear reaction rates mentioned above , concern aspects of the envelope . as an illustrative example",
    ", the low mass co nova ( 0.8 m@xmath8 ) emits a flux in the 511 kev line , which is smaller than that emitted by other more massive novae by a factor larger than their ratio of @xmath1f yields ( see figure [ lcannihil ] left and table [ radioac ] ) . in order to study these factors ,",
    "we varied ejected masses and velocity profiles in some of our models , leaving the abundances of radioactive material unchanged .",
    "these models are interesting for illustrative purposes , although they are not self consistent .",
    "an additional interest comes from the fact that all current theoretical nova models still fail to reproduce some observed ejected masses ( observed larger than theoretical ) .",
    "the effect of ejected mass is shown in figure [ paramm ] for a co ( left ) and an one ( right ) nova . in both cases ,",
    "the effect of ejected mass at early epochs is opposite to that at later times . at early times , the larger the ejected mass the larger the opacity of the envelope to gamma - rays ; therefore , novae with larger ejected masses emit smaller fluxes . on the contrary , at later times ( after @xmath101 day , see figure [ paramm ] ) , the envelope is more transparent and the fluxes almost directly reflect the amount of @xmath1f ( i.e. , the larger the ejected mass the larger the flux ) . in the one novae ,",
    "the fluxes emitted in the `` plateau '' phase directly reflect the amount of @xmath2na ( thus the ratio of fluxes equals the ratio of ejected masses ) .",
    "the influence of the velocity of the ejecta is displayed in figure [ paramv ] . at early epochs ,",
    "the gamma - ray flux increases with envelope velocities because of increased transparency .",
    "later on ( around 1 day after peak temperature ) , one novae differ from co novae , because of their much larger @xmath2na content : the decline of the gamma - ray flux in one novae is delayed by @xmath2na positrons annihilating in the envelope , until the moment when the envelope becomes transparent to positrons and also these annihilations fade away .",
    "this happens some weeks later , the exact figure depending on the transparency of the envelope ; therefore , the smaller the velocity , the smaller the transparency at a given time and the longer the duration of this phase ( see figure [ paramv ] right ) .",
    "we have shown that the continuum ( 20 - 511 kev ) and 511 kev line light curves provide a direct insight into the dynamics of the expanding envelope , as well as information about the nova type and its @xmath1f ( co and one novae ) and @xmath2na ( one novae ) content .",
    "the fluxes in various continuum bands and in the 511 kev line are more intense than those in the 478 kev line and 1275 kev lines , but their short duration and early appearence makes them impossible to detect with standard pointed observations .",
    "only all - sky monitors , able to do surveys in the range from 20 to 600 kev , are suited for such type of detection .",
    "attempts have been made with the tgrs instrument onboard the wind satellite @xcite , the batse onboard the compton gamma - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "the negative results obtained up to now are consitent with our predicted fluxes .",
    "therefore , we have to wait for more sensitive instruments ( exist , advanced compton telescope ) , or hopefully the shield of the future integral spectrometer spi @xcite , to confirm the theoretical predictions and to extract all the crucial information about the nova phenomenon that only the gamma - rays can provide .",
