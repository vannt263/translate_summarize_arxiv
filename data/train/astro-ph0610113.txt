    "after a short and often violent phase of formation , galaxies undergo a long , quiet phase of evolution , called secular evolution ( e.g. kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) . given its duration , this can have very important effects on the galaxy properties .",
    "for barred galaxies , secular evolution is driven by the bar which grows as the angular momentum is exchanged within the galaxy .",
    "this is emitted by near - resonant material in the bar region and absorbed by near - resonant material in the halo and , to a much lesser extent , in the outer disc ( athanassoula 2002 , 2003 ) . here",
    "we will discuss specific aspects of this secular evolution , linked to the bar and to the boxy / peanut bulge .",

    "time is given in computer units , with a 100 computer units being roughly equivalent to @xmath1 gyrs.,height=302 ]        the backbone of two - dimensional ( or very thin ) bars consists of a family of periodic orbits elongated along the bar and closing after one revolution around the center and two radial oscillations ( contopoulos & papayannopoulos 1980 ; athanassoula et al .",
    "these orbits are called x@xmath2 and , when stable , they trap around them regular orbits of roughly the same orientation and shape .",
    "the orbital structure in three dimensions is similar , but richer and more complicated ( pfenniger 1984 ; skokos , patsis & athanassoula 2002a , b ; patsis , skokos & athanassoula 2002 ) . the backbone of three - dimensional bars is the x@xmath2 tree , i.e. the x@xmath2 family plus a number of two- and three - dimensional families bifurcating from it ( skokos , patsis & athanassoula 2002a ) .",
    "the three - dimensional families , together with the regular orbits trapped around them , make an edge - on box or peanut shape ( patsis , skokos & athanassoula 2002 ) , such as observed in some edge - on disc galaxies and referred to as a boxy or peanut bulge .",
    "thus , boxy / peanut bulges are _ parts _ of bars seen edge - on .",
    "the interpretation of slit spectra of such structures link them to bars ( kuijken & merrifield 1995 ; bureau & freeman 1999 ; merrifield & kuijken 1999 ; chung & bureau 2004 ) as was established by the exhaustive modeling of athanassoula & bureau ( 1999 ) and bureau & athanassoula ( 2005 ) .",
    "this link was reinforced by a study of the nir photometry of a sample of edge - on disc galaxies ( bureau et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the formation and evolution of boxy / peanut bulges is witnessed in many @xmath0-body simulations ( e.g. combes & sanders 1981 ; combes et al . 1990 ; pfenniger & friedli 1991 ; raha et al .",
    "1991 ; berentzen et al .",

    "[ fig : barpntgrowth ] , they form rather abruptly , roughly at the same rate as bars , but after some delay ( combes et al .",
    "1990 ; martinez - valpuesta & shlosman 2004 ) .",
    "the formation , often referred to as buckling , is accompanied by a decrease of the bar strength ( raha et al .",
    "1991 ; martinez - valpuesta & shlosman 2004 ; athanassoula 2005c ; martinez - valpuesta et al .",
    "2006 ; debattista et al .",
    "2006 ) . several cases with more than one buckling episode have been reported in the literature ( athanassoula 2005c ; martinez - valpuesta et al .",
    "athanassoula & misiriotis ( 2002 ) , based on a few simulations , showed that the strongest bars have , when viewed edge on , the strongest peanuts , or ` x ' shapes .",
    "this was further established , on the basis of a very large number of simulations , by athanassoula & martinez - valpuesta ( in prep . ) who find a strong correlation between bar and peanut strength ( fig .",
    "[ fig : barpntcorrel ] ) .",
    "thus , the trend between bar and peanut strengths , initially found in observations ( ltticke , dettmar & pohlen 2000 ) , is well reproduced by simulations .",
    "[ fig : barpntcorrel ] also shows that simulations in which two bucklings occurred tend to have stronger bars and peanuts than simulations with only one buckling ( athanassoula & martinez - valpuesta , in prep . ) .",
    "the upper panels give a side - on view ( i.e. edge - on , with the line of sight along the bar minor axis ) , the lower ones a face - on view and the middle ones a view at @xmath3 .",
    "the length of the bar , as estimated from the face - on view , is given by a solid vertical line .",
    "the length of the box / peanut , as estimated by the edge - on view , is given by a vertical dashed line .",

    "the length of the box / peanut , as estimated by the edge - on view , is given by a vertical dashed line .",
    "it is clear that the extent of the boxy / peanut feature is much shorter than the extent of the bar .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=377 ]    orbital structure studies , as well as @xmath0-body simulations , have shown that boxy / peanut bulges , being a _",
    "part _ of the bar , should have a shorter extent than that of the bar ( for a discussion see athanassoula 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3views ] , which shows the disc and classical bulge components of two simulations at a time after the bar and peanut have grown .",
    "the length of the bar is estimated from the face - on view and the length of the box / peanut from the side - on one .",
    "i extend the vertical lines in all three panels and this makes it evident that the bar is considerably longer than the boxy / peanut feature .",
    "thus , both orbital structure studies and @xmath0-body simulations conclude that the bar , being a three - dimensional object , has a thick inner part of shorter extent and a thin outer part , of longer extent .",
    "this view of the bar structure is in good agreement with observations ( see athanassoula 2005a for a compilation ) .",
    "thus , it is necessary to be careful when comparing observations to simulations , or when comparing observations of galaxies seen at different orientations , because a different part of the bar is seen in face - on and in edge - on views ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3views ] ) . further evidence that boxy / peanut bulges are just _ parts _ of bars seen",
    "edge - on has been presented and discussed by athanassoula ( 2005a ) .",
    "this is based on detailed comparisons of @xmath0-body simulations to observations and includes morphology , photometry ( density / light profiles along horizontal and vertical cuts , results from median filtering ) and kinematics ( cylindrical rotation , gaseous and stellar position velocity diagrams ) .",
    "fig .  [ fig:3views ] displays also the disc and classical bulge at an intermediate inclination of @xmath3 , the bar major axis being again along the galaxy major axis ( @xmath4 axis ) .",
    "one can distinguish three regions with different isodensity shapes .",
    "in the inner region , ending roughly where the thick part of the bar ends , the isophotes have a rectangular - like shape .",
    "this is due to the shape of the thick part of the bar .",
    "the outermost region has elliptical isophotes , due to the disc .",
    "the intermediate region has isophotes of a more complex shape , with two clear protuberances ( elongations ) along the bar major axis on either side of the center .",
    "this is , in fact , due to the projected shape of the thin outer part of the bar .",
    "this intermediate region extends , as expected , from the end of the thick part of the bar to the end of the thin part ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3views ] ) .",
    "let us now compare the isodensity structure of the simulations , discussed above , to the isophotes of m31 in the nir , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m31_iso ] .",
    "such a comparison was done initially by athanassoula and beaton ( 2006 ) , while the nir data from the 2mass `` 6x survey '' are presented and discussed by beaton et al .",
    "similar structures are seen on the 3.6 @xmath5 m image from the infrared array camera on the spitzer space telescope ( barmby et al .",
    "it is clear that the m31 isophotes have the same three regions as presented above .",
    "an inner region with boxy isophotes , an outer region with elliptical isophotes and an intermediate region with protuberances ( elongations ) pointing to a direction not far from that of the galaxy major axis .",
    "this argues that m31 has a bar with the standard three dimensional shape , i.e a thick inner part and a thin outer part .",
    "such isophotal shapes are also found in other disc galaxies observed at similar intermediate orientations , as ngc 7582 ( quillen et al . 1997 ) and ngc 4442 ( bettoni & galletta 1994 ) , again revealing the existence of a bar .",
    "athanassoula & beaton ( 2006 ) made a comparison of m31 to fiducial @xmath0-body barred galaxy models , including isophotal / isodensity shapes , light / mass profiles along cuts parallel to the galaxy major axis and kinematics .",
    "they argue that m31 has a bar , whose length can be estimated to be roughly 22 and whose major axis is at a small angle with respect to the galaxy major axis .",
    "they also present arguments that m31 has both a classical and a boxy / peanut bulge .",
    "this model accounts for the pseudo - ring at roughly 50 as an outer ring due to the bar , as observed in a large fraction of barred galaxies ( e.g. buta 1995 ) .",
    "indeed , 50 is compatible with the radius of the outer lindblad resonance of the bar , where outer rings form ( schwarz 1981 ; athanassoula et al .",
    "1982 ; buta 1995 ) .    a similar bar structure , with a thick inner part ( consisting of the boxy / peanut feature ) and",
    "a thin outer part of longer extent , has been found by a number of studies of our own galaxy ( e.g. hammersley et al .",
    "1994 ; lpez - corredoira et al .",
