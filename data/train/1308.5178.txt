    "there are basically two approaches to perturbation theory in general relativity ( gr ) : the lifshitz s method @xcite which was rigorously improved by the work of bardeen @xcite and others @xcite and the covariant method given by the quasi - maxwellian ( qm ) equations @xcite , which was first proposed by hawking @xcite and improved by olson @xcite , ellis _",
    "et al _ @xcite and novello _ et al _ @xcite . the former includes perturbations of non - observable quantities such as @xmath0 and it mixes true perturbations with coordinate transformations coming from the gauge freedom due to the arbitrariness of the correspondence between a fictitious background space - time and the physical inhomogeneous one . in bardeen",
    "s approach gauge - invariant quantities are constructed as combinations of the perturbations of the metric and of the matter content , but no clear physical interpretation can be given to those variables .",
    "on the other hand , the qm equations offer a natural covariant approach to perturbation theory , in which it is possible to find suitable gauge - invariant variables that are directly linked to observational quantities , thus making the physical interpretation clear and providing an elegant description . in this approach , it is possible to find a set of perturbed quantities which are considered as `` good '' ones as their unperturbed counterparts are null in the background and , therefore , stewart & walker s lemma @xcite ensures that the associated perturbed quantities are gauge - invariant . in @xcite for instance this method was applied to the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) models in order to find the minimal closed set of variables necessary to the perturbative analysis , in terms of which all other quantities could be written .",
    "remarkably , this minimal set contained only two of the full set of perturbation variables providing a planar dynamical system , from which all the other quantities could be expressed .",
    "the relation between the covariant formalism and bardeen s approach have been clarified in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in our case , the presence of an anisotropic pressure due to a primordial magnetic field ( pmf ) removes some symmetries of the flrw models and makes the analysis a bit more complex .",
    "we show that it is possible to construct a minimal set consisting of three gauge - invariant variables contained in the full set we have at our disposal .",
    "the latter includes the fractional gradient of the energy density and the gradient of the expansion coefficient , both orthogonal to the fluid flow , which were introduced by ellis and bruni @xcite . in the special case of large wavelengths , when the equations for the perturbations reduces to a planar system ,",
    "it is possible to construct a second order equation from which we can analyze the growth of inhomogeneities .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section [ notation ]",
    "we give the main definitions needed for the description of perturbations in the qm approach . in section [ background ]",
    "we briefly introduce the background model and its important features . in section [ basis ]",
    "we construct the complete basis for the perturbations and derive from them the necessary quantities for the subsequent analysis . afterwards , in section [ set ] , we present the set of variables needed to describe the perturbations and their corresponding evolution equations . in section [ pert ]",
    "we perform the perturbative analysis focusing on the large wavelength behavior . then",
    ", we compare our results with the standard flrw model in order to verify how the growth of perturbations are modified in this new scenario and if the anisotropic pressure could play a role similar to a dark matter component in the standard cosmological model .",
    "the full set of the quasi - maxwellian equations , the conservation laws for the matter content and the evolution equations for the kinematical quantities are presented in the appendix .",
    "we consider the standard definitions given in @xcite to introduce the qm approach to general relativity , except for some conventions ( for details see the appendix ) .",
    "the weyl conformal tensor is defined as @xmath1 where the auxiliary tensors are @xmath2 and @xmath3    the weyl tensor can be separated into its electric and magnetic parts , defined as @xmath4 h_{\\alpha\\beta}&\\doteq&-^{*}w_{\\alpha\\mu\\beta\\nu}v^{\\mu}v^{\\nu } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the dual weyl tensor constructed with the skew - symmetric levi - civita tensor .",

    "the metric @xmath9 and the normalized vector field @xmath8 ( tangent to a timelike congruence of curves @xmath10 ) induce a projector @xmath11 which splits tensors in terms of quantities defined along @xmath10 plus quantities defined on the three - dimensional space orthogonal to @xmath8 .",

    "we introduce the so - called kinematical quantities through the decomposition of the covariant derivative of @xmath16 into its irreducible parts : @xmath17 where the expansion coefficient is @xmath18 the acceleration is @xmath19 the traceless and symmetric shear tensor is @xmath20 and the skew - symmetric vorticity tensor is @xmath21},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 means symmetrization and @xmath23 $ ] means anti - symmetrization .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the recent proposal @xcite in which it is assumed a friedmann - like geometry @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 represents the cosmic time , @xmath26 is the scale factor and @xmath27 is an arbitrary function .",
    "we consider as source the linear lagrangian of maxwell s theory of electromagnetism @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to this lagrangian is @xmath30 whose decomposition into irreducible parts with respect to a normalized time - like vector field @xmath16 yields @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the energy density , @xmath35 is the isotropic pressure , @xmath36 is the heat flux and @xmath37 is the anisotropic pressure .",
    "it is convenient to assume the cosmic observer @xmath38 . due to the special symmetries of the metric  ( [ fried ] ) ,",
    "the electromagnetic field can be considered as source of the gravitational field only if an averaging process is performed ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . the standard way to compute the volumetric spatial average of an arbitrary quantity x at the instant @xmath39",
    "is defined by    @xmath40    where we denote @xmath41 and @xmath42 is a sufficiently large time dependent spatial volume .",
    "therefore , the first and second moments of the electric @xmath43 and magnetic @xmath44 fields are usually given by the so - called tolman relations :    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    we keep only the magnetic component of this mean field due to the high conductivity of the primordial plasma .",
    "moreover , we do not impose homogeneity of the space - time but keep only the isotropy .",
    "therefore , part of the tolman relations are preserved [ eq .  ( [ rel_tol_1 ] ) ] .",
    "however , our choice leads us to slightly modify the tolman relation concerning the second moment of the magnetic field ( [ rel_tol_3 ] ) , as follows    @xmath48    where we introduce an arbitrary traceless matrix @xmath49 that will be identified to an anisotropic pressure term , through eq .",

    ", the time evolution of this cosmological model is driven by the usual friedmann equations and the anisotropic pressure produces a non - vanishing weyl tensor .",

    "this geometry is no longer maximally symmetric due to the presence of the last two terms .",
    "finally , making the coordinate transformation given by @xmath56 , the line element  ( [ fried ] ) becomes    @xmath57    the corresponding qm equations of this solution are ( see details in appendix ) :    [ qm_gfried ] @xmath58 & & \\dot\\rho+(\\rho+p)\\,\\theta=0,\\label{qm_gfried2}\\\\[2ex ] & & e_{\\mu\\nu}=-{\\frac{\\textstyle{1}}{\\textstyle{2}}}\\pi_{\\mu\\nu},\\label{qm_gfried3}\\\\[2ex ] & & e^{\\alpha}{}_{\\mu;\\alpha}=0,\\label{qm_gfried4}\\\\[2ex ] & & h^{\\epsilon}{}_{\\mu}h^{\\nu}{}_{\\lambda}\\dot e^{\\mu}{}_{\\nu } + \\frac{2}{3}\\,\\theta\\ , e^{\\epsilon}{}_{\\lambda } = 0.\\label{qm_gfried5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eqs .",

    "( [ qm_gfried3 ] ) yields immediately the electric part of the weyl tensor in terms of the anisotropic pressure .",
    "( [ qm_gfried4 ] ) represents the compatibility condition of the einstein equations with the ( constant ) spatial curvature and eq .",
    "( [ qm_gfried5 ] ) provides the time evolution of @xmath61 .",
    "note that these equations do not imply that the weyl tensor is identically zero .",
    "once eqs .",
    "( [ qm_gfried1]-[qm_gfried2 ] ) are decoupled from eqs .",
    "( [ qm_gfried3]-[qm_gfried4 ] ) we see that this model can be extended to any equation of state ( eos ) of the form @xmath62 , which is also valid for a mixture of non - interacting fluids .    from a straightforward calculation ,",

    "we conclude that the friedmann equations modify the weyl tensor through the solution for @xmath26 , but the weyl tensor does not change the friedmann equations .",
    "the remarkable exact relation  ( [ qm_gfried3 ] ) , which was not highlighted in the literature before , informs us that the dissipative process to which the fluid is subjected is compensated in such a way that the tidal forces of the constituting microscopic parts of the fluid produce a reversal effect .",
    "this fact is confirmed in the geodesic deviation of the fluid flow which remains undistorted by these quantities .",
    "we now proceed with the set up of the framework for treating the perturbed version of this model .",
    "since the seminal lifshitz paper @xcite and the improvements displayed by lifshitz and khalatinikov @xcite , it has been useful to expand all perturbed quantities in the spherical harmonics basis .",
    "once we are interested only in the linear regime of the perturbations , the laplace - beltrami operator defined at the 3-hypersurface orthogonal to @xmath16 provides a complete set of functions which expand all perturbed quantities lying on this surface .",
    "this is also achieved due to the isotropy of the metric  ( [ fried_r_pi ] ) , which allows the separation of variables transforming the eigenvalue problem in a set of ordinary differential equations to be solved .",
    "it suffices for our purposes to take into account only the spatial scalar harmonic functions @xmath64 and its derived vector and tensor quantities @xmath65 for a while , it is necessary to distinguish covariant derivative in the 4-dimensional space - time by the symbol ( ;) and the derivative on the spatial hypersurface by ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath64 obey the following eigenvalue equation in the 3-dimensional background space for each mode @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a constant ( the wave number ) and @xmath69 defines the 3-dimensional laplace - beltrami operator .",
    "the general solution of this equation is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 , are the spherical harmonics and @xmath74 satisfies    @xmath75 - [ m^2r^2+p(p+1)]r=0.\\ ] ]    note that only the complete integration of the above differential equation can inform the range of values allowed for @xmath76 .",
    "however , it does nt have a known analytic solution for arbitrary values of the parameters , particularly , @xmath77 and @xmath78 which we are interested in .",
    "we define the traceless operator @xmath79 and its divergence can be computed yielding @xmath80 in the expression above the einstein equations were used and @xmath81 is a tensor involving only the spatial coordinates .    in particular , all possible projections of the anisotropic pressure . ] on the basis components can be rewritten in terms of this basis , if we assume that it is a complete one .",
    "therefore , we write    @xmath82    @xmath83    and @xmath84 where the coefficients @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are constants for each of the modes @xmath68 and @xmath88 . note that the summation symbol should be replaced by an integration symbol depending on the spectrum of the laplace operator .    for our purposes",
    ", it is not important the explicit form of the scalar functions , but instead only the fact that such functions form a complete set with which it is possible to expand all perturbed quantities . therefore , assuming a small deviation of the metric given in ( [ fried ] ) when compared to flrw , the quantities @xmath89 should be necessarily bounded , but they are not arbitrarily small . note that @xmath90 and @xmath91 are not independent quantities : from eqs .",
    "( [ scalar_exp ] ) and ( [ vector_exp ] ) we have @xmath92 note also that once the free parameter @xmath52 of the metric  ( [ fried_r_pi ] ) is fixed , and this should be achieved through observations , all these quantities should be completely determined .",
    "in this section we search for a set of gauge - invariant variables needed to perform the perturbative analysis and their correspondent evolution equations . according to the evolution equation for the shear tensor ( [ evol_quant_cine2 ] ) , we have @xmath93 which is a good variable as it is null in the background , hence a perturbation on it yields a true physical perturbation . to this variable",
    "we add the shear @xmath94 itself , which is also null in the background .",
    "following @xcite , we also consider as good variables the comoving fractional energy density gradient    @xmath95    and the comoving gradient of the expansion coefficient @xmath96    to this set of variables , we can still add other quantities that are null on the background : the acceleration @xmath97 and the divergence of the anisotropic pressure @xmath98 .    the unperturbed equations for the above variables follow from the evolution equations ( [ quase_max4 ] ) , ( [ expl_proj_conserv_mom_eneg1 ] ) , ( [ evol_quant_cine1 ] ) and ( [ evol_quant_cine2 ] ) and are written as    @xmath99    @xmath100    @xmath101    @xmath102    where @xmath103 and terms that would generate second order perturbations have already been discarded .",
    "the quantities @xmath104 and @xmath105 represent the total energy density and pressure , respectively , of a non - interacting mixture of simple fluids .",
    "they are related through the equation of state @xmath106 where we have introduced an effective eos parameter @xcite which , in the case of a universe filled with dust and radiation , is given by and we can always assume that it has the value of the dominating fluid , cf .  @xcite . ] @xmath107 the frame chosen is such that there s no energy flux , that is , @xmath108 . to these equations",
    "we must add the non - trivial constraint equations ( [ quase_max1 ] ) , ( [ expl_proj_conserv_mom_eneg2 ] ) and ( [ eq_vinc_quant_cine1 ] ) .",
    "the term @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) is determined by the causal thermodynamical relation @xcite restricted by the symmetries of ( [ fried ] ) .",
    "it reads @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the relaxation time and @xmath112 is the viscosity parameter .",
    "this equation is valid only in the linear perturbation regime and was derived guided by the principle that the entropy flux is to be strictly local , that is , independent of gradients of the energy - momentum tensor and of the particle flux vector . in our case ,",
    "in the background we have @xmath113 such that relations ( [ pi ] ) give the relaxation time @xmath114 the relation @xmath115 was already considered in previous works in different contexts @xcite .",
    "from the original qm equations we have obtained equations for a set of suitable variables as described in the last section and now we aim to construct the perturbed version of them up to first order scalar perturbations .",
    "similar analyses have been performed in refs @xcite where they have considered the contribution of anisotropic stresses on top of the usual perfect fluid content to the evolution of perturbations of a standard flrw universe using the covariant approach . in particular , in @xcite , this anisotropic stress is due specifically to a vector magnetic field that should be small in order not to break isotropy . in both cases , terms that couple the anisotropic pressure with shear",
    "have been considered as second order as they indeed are in a flrw background . in our case , however , as seen in section [ background ] , we restrict ourselves to an anisotropic pressure component non - null at the background caused by random pmf  which has no vector character  and whose effect can not be perceived at the zeroth order due to a compensation by the electric part of the weyl tensor . in short , @xmath116 at the background , which turns out to be a modified flrw , and that s the reason why we have to consider terms like @xmath117 as first order ones .    in what follows",
    "we present the full set of equations for perturbations at linear order .",
    "in particular , in the long wavelength regime , we get a system that is closed in only two variables allowing to perform a simpler phenomenological analysis and to obtain a second order equation for the evolution of such perturbations .",
    "then , a comparison with the standard cosmological scenario in this regime is made .",

    "we have shown that , depending on the values of the parameters involved , it is possible to have a larger growth of the perturbations when compared to the standard flrw model , which could in principle play the role of dark matter or at least diminish its contribution in structure formation .",
    "clearly , an analysis of the dependence on the wavenumber of the constants involved is needed to confirm it and in particular to treat the issue of scale invariance of the perturbations and the asymptotic behavior for small scales , which shall be treated in a future work .",
    "anyhow , it is a very interesting fact that taking into account a non - null anisotropic pressure component which is hidden at the non - perturbative level could give us a scenario where perturbations are enhanced and that might not fully rely on an unknown dark component .",

    "we know that a riemannian geometry satisfies the bianchi identities . in particular , in the case of general relativity , the bianchi identities together with the einstein equations yield the quasi - maxwellian equations of gravity .",
    "these equations are easily obtained if we rewrite the riemann tensor in terms of its traces and the weyl tensor , according to the relations defined in section [ notation ] .",

    "the reason of the nomenclature is due to several analogies between the quasi - maxwellian and the maxwell equations .",
    "however , this similarity does not go further because the qm equations are in fact highly non - linear and of higher order of differentiability in comparison to maxwell s theory , leading to situations that never happen in the last case .",
    "indeed , the similitude appears when we make the projection of the qm equations with respect to the vector field @xmath183 and its orthogonal hypersurface . at this point , it is very useful to replace the weyl tensor by its electric @xmath6 and magnetic @xmath7 parts :      where @xmath5 is the dual of weyl tensor constructed with the skew - symmetric levi - civita tensor . in the same way as the faraday tensor @xmath184",

    "<S> in a previous work the authors have solved the einstein equations of general relativity for a class of metrics with constant spatial curvature , where it was found a non vanishing weyl tensor in the presence of a primordial magnetic field with an anisotropic pressure component . here , we perform the perturbative analysis of this model in order to study the gravitational stability under linear scalar perturbations . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we take the quasi - maxwellian formalism of general relativity as our framework , which offers a naturally covariant and gauge - invariant approach to deal with perturbations that are directly linked to observational quantities . </S>",
