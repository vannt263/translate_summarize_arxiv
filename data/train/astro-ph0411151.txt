    "it is important to understand the distribution , physical conditions , and metallicity of the baryons in the universe , both as a function of redshift ( i.e. , time ) and as a function of environmental factors ( e.g. , proximity to galaxies , galaxy groups / clusters , or voids ) .",
    "ordinary baryonic matter plays a fundamental role in galaxy formation and evolution , and the state of the baryons often provides a stringent test of cosmological theories .",
    "measurements of deuterium abundances in low - metallicity qso absorption systems ( e.g. , burles & tytler 1998 ; omeara et al . 2001 ; sembach et al .",
    "2004a ) and observations of the cosmic microwave background ( e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) provide good estimations of the _ total _ quantity of baryons expected to be found in the universe ; expressed as the usual units of the closure density , these measurements indicate that @xmath7 . at high redshifts , it appears that the matter in the ly@xmath1 forest can account for the majority of the expected baryons ( weinberg et al . 1997 ; rauch et al . 1997 ; schaye 2001 ) , but attempts to inventory the baryons in the nearby universe generally fail to find enough ordinary matter in the form of stars , hot ( x - ray emitting ) gas in clusters , and cold gas ( see fukugita et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) ; the sum of these well - observed baryon reservoirs appears to be at least a factor of 2 lower than the predicted amount at the present epoch .",
    "a variety of solutions to this `` missing baryons '' problem have been proposed , and considerable observational effort is currently being invested to test these ideas .",
    "one possible solution has emerged from hydrodynamic simulations of cosmological structure growth .",
    "these simulations predict that at high redshifts , all of the baryons were indeed in the cool , photoionized ly@xmath1 forest , but as time passed , much of that matter collapsed and turned into galaxies , and much of the ly@xmath1 forest that did nt turn into stars was shock heated into the @xmath8 k temperature range . in these models , at the present time the @xmath8 k baryons remain located in the low - density intergalactic gas , the so - called `` warm - hot intergalactic medium '' ( whim or whigm ) . as shown in figure  [ models ] , many different cdm cosmological simulations robustly make the same prediction with regard to baryonic content of the whigm : currently , roughly 1/3 of the baryons are in stars in galaxies , 1/3 are in the shock - heated whigm , and 1/3 remain in the cool photoionized ly@xmath1 forest ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "since the whigm result reproducibly emerges from a diverse set of cosmological simulations , observational evidence that a significant portion of the baryons are located in the low@xmath0 whigm would therefore not only solve the long - standing missing baryons problem and provide important constraints for galaxy evolution modeling , this would also indicate that at least in some regards , the cosmological simulations are able to capture enough of the igm physics adequately to make correct predictions .",
    "due to its low density and temperature range , the whigm is expected to be exceedingly difficult to detect in emission .",
    "absorption spectroscopy provides a much more sensitive means to study low - density gas , and in the near term this technique is likely to provide the primary observational constraints on the low - redshift whigm . in the ultraviolet , the resonance line doublet of li - like at 1031.93 and 1037.62   is particularly useful for whigm observations because ( 1 ) in collisional ionization eq .",
    ", peaks in abundance at log @xmath9 5.5 , ( 2 ) oxygen is the most abundant metal , and ( 3 ) the lines have relatively large @xmath10values .    to search for low@xmath0 absorbers and the missing baryons ,",
    "we have been observing low - redshift qsos for several years with both the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse)_. these observations have revealed a large number of intervening and associated ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) systems .",
    "examples of the detected lines are shown in figures  [ stisexample ] and [ fuseexample ] .",
    "the first qso that we observed for this purpose ( h1821 + 643 , shown in figure  [ stisexample ] ) unveiled a surprisingly large number of intervening systems ( tripp , savage , & jenkins 2000 ; oegerle et al .",
    "the detection of six intervening absorbers toward h1821 + 643 indicated an incidence of systems per unit redshift @xmath12 50 for lines with rest equivalent width @xmath13 m . observations of other sight lines confirmed the redshift density of lines at @xmath14 ( tripp & savage 2000 ; savage et al .",
    "2002 ; richter et al .",
    "2004 , sembach et al . 2004b ; prochaska et al . 2004 ) . to estimate the baryonic content of the systems , information ( or assumptions ) about the gas metallicity ( o / h ) and ionization fraction @xmath15 ( ) are required . however , since @xmath16 ( ) @xmath17()@xmath18(o / h)@xmath18 , it is possible to place useful lower limits on @xmath19 ( ) by assuming the maximum plausible values for @xmath15 ( ) and ( o / h ) . for , the ion fraction rarely exceeds 0.2 ( tripp & savage 2000 ) , but it is less clear what the maximum ( or even the typical ) metallicity might be . assuming ( o / h ) = 0.1 ( o / h)@xmath20 and @xmath15 ( ) @xmath6 0.2 , we find that low@xmath0 absorbers harbor 5% or more of the baryons .    the baryonic content and @xmath3 of the low@xmath0 lines derived from the first observations are consistent with the predictions from a variety of cosmological simulations ( cen et al .",
    "2001 , fang & bryan 2001 ; chen et al .",
    "however , the first observational papers suffered considerably from small - sample statistics . to rectify this problem ,",
    "we have acquired additional observations of low@xmath0 qsos with the e140 m echelle mode of stis . combined with additional e140 m data from the _ hst _ archive",
    ", we now have a sample of 16 qsos with @xmath21 . at the time of this writing",
    ", we have found 44 intervening absorbers and 14 associated systems in these spectra .",
    "we have carefully assessed the total redshift path probed by this sample ( e.g. , we have corrected the path to account for regions that are blocked by strong ism or unrelated extragalactic lines , and we have accounted for s / n variations vs. @xmath22 for each sight line ) . with this substantially larger sample ,",
    "we find for the intervening systems @xmath3 ( ) = @xmath4 for lines with rest equivalent width @xmath5 30 m . again assuming ( o / h ) = 0.1 ( o / h)@xmath20 and @xmath15 ( ) @xmath23",
    ", we obtain @xmath16 ( ) = 0.0027 or @xmath19()/@xmath16(total ) @xmath24 0.068 , i.e. , 7% of the baryons .",
    "it is important to note that we have used the recent revision of the solar oxygen abundance reported by allende prieto et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to determine the value of ( o / h ) = 1/10 ( o / h)@xmath20 for this calculation of @xmath19(o  vi ) . our previous papers used ( o / h)@xmath20 from grevesse & coworkers ( e.g. , grevesse et al . 1996 ) ; the allende prieto et al . value for (",
    "o / h)@xmath20 is substantially lower . since @xmath19 ( ) @xmath25 ( o / h)@xmath18 , the substantial reduction in the solar oxgyen abundance reported by allende prieto et al .",
    "leads to an increase in @xmath19(o  vi ) .",
    "taking into account the revision of ( o / h)@xmath20 , the new constraints on @xmath19 ( ) are in excellent agreement with the earlier findings .",
    "our sample applies to systems with @xmath26 0.12 ; we note that a largely independent sample of systems at @xmath27 0.15 compiled by danforth & shull ( 2004 ) yields very similar values for @xmath3 and @xmath19 ( ) .",
    "we are continuing to add data to our sample , mainly by adding _ fuse _ observations of the same sight lines , which provide information about lines at @xmath27 0.13 .",
    "but what about the ionization and metallicity of the systems ? is 1/10 solar metallicity an appropriate assumption , and moreover are the absorbers collisionally ionized as expected for the ( shocked ) whigm ?",
    "low@xmath0 absorption systems appear to have a wide range of metallicities : some show very low abundances ( e.g. , tripp et al . 2002 ; 2004 ) while others have attained @xmath28 ( e.g. , savage et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; jenkins et al .",
    "2005 ) . likewise , some systems appear to be photoionized by the uv background ( e.g. , savage et al .",
    "2002 ) , but some lines arise in collisionally ionized , hot gas ( e.g. , tripp et al . 2001 ; savage et al .",
    "moreover , there is undeniable evidence that many systems are multiphase entities ( tripp et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; shull et al . 2003 ; richter et al .",
    "2004 ; sembach et al .",
    "2004b ; savage et al .",
    "2004 ; tumlinson et al .",
    "2004 ) . in the near term",
    ", the multiphase nature of the systems complicates the interpretation of the absorbers , but ultimately the rich information in these cases will likely be very valuable for understanding their detailed nature .",
    "what about baryons in the cool , photoionized ly@xmath1 clouds at low redshifts ? there is good agreement regarding the statistics ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) of low@xmath0 ly@xmath1 lines ( compare tripp et al .",
    "1998 ; penton et al . 2000a , 2004 ; richter et al .",
    "2004 ; sembach et al .",
    "2004b ) . to estimate the baryonic content of the ly@xmath1 absorbers , very large ionization corrections must be applied , but at least no metallicity information is needed .",
    "estimations of the total baryonic mass in the low@xmath0 ly@xmath1 forest ( e.g. , shull , stocke , & penton 1996 ; penton et al .",
    "2000a,2004 ) indicate that @xmath2930% of the baryons are in these systems , in agreement with the cosmological simulations .",
    "there is certainly overlap between and ly@xmath1 absorbers , and this raises a concern about how to fold the contributions of the and ly@xmath1 absorbers into the overall inventory of baryons : if some of the systems are photoionized and have corresponding lines ( e.g. , savage et al .",
    "2002 ) , then these baryons could be double - counted .",
    "however , it is probably also true that some of the ly@xmath1 lines which are assumed to arise in cool , photoionized gas actually originate in hot gas , so the double - counting problem operates in both directions . and , it is possible ( even likely ) that many systems contain a mix of hot and cool gas .",
    "we note that photoionized systems are expected in the cosmological models ( cen et al .",
    "2001 ; fang & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "solution of this problem will require large samples of absorbers with good - quality line measurements .",
    "several papers have presented evidence of broad ly@xmath1 lines with @xmath30values in excess of 40 km s@xmath18 ( e.g. , tripp et al . 2001 ; bowen , pettini , & blades 2002 ; richter et al .",
    "2004 ; sembach et al .",
    "penton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have found broad ly@xmath1 lines as well but in some cases have mandated that these be fit with multiple components .",
    "similarly , the automatic profile fitting algorithm used by dav & tripp ( 2001 ) forced the broad features to be fitted with multiple components . some examples of broad ly@xmath1 lines are shown in figure  4a ; see richter et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and sembach et al .",
    "( 2004b ) for additional plots of these broad lines .",
    "figure  4b shows the @xmath30values and columns for all ly@xmath1 lines identified by richter et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and sembach et al .",
    "( 2004b ) ; this panel shows a significant population of strikingly broad lines .",
    "if the broadening of these lines is predominantly due to thermal motions , then the implied temperature is in the whigm range , and their baryonic content is substantial ( similar to the systems ) .",
    "it remains possible that the breadth of these features is not due to the gas temperature .",
    "however , many of the broad ly@xmath1 lines are well - detected ( see , e.g. , figure 7 in sembach et al .",
    "2004b ) and can not be instrument artifacts . while they could be continuum undulations intrinsic to qso spectrum",
    ", this appears unlikely .",
    "a more likely explanation is that the broad ly@xmath1 lines are multiple , blended components as assumed in some of the papers above .",
    "very high s / n spectra would be valuable for testing this possibility : if the lines are multiple blended features , departures from a simple gaussian shape could be evident in high s / n data .",
    "we note that some of the broad ly@xmath1 lines presented in sembach et al .",
    "( 2004b ) have good signal - to - noise and appear to be well - described by a single , smooth feature , i.e. , there are no obvious indications of multiple components at the current signal - to - noise level ( see figure 7 in sembach et al .",
    "it would also be useful to compare the observed @xmath31 vs. n ( ) ( as in figure  4b to predictions from hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "many papers have investigated the relationships between low@xmath0 ly@xmath1 lines and nearby galaxies / structures .",
    "a review of this literature is beyond the scope of this paper ; a reasonable synopsis is that the majority of the low@xmath0 ly@xmath1 lines are strongly correlated with galaxies but a few are found in voids ( e.g. , penton et al .",
    "2000b ; mclin et al .",
    "2002 ) , but despite the strong correlation , the detailed nature of the ly@xmath1-galaxy relationship is not yet well - understood .",
    "the ly@xmath1 lines almost certainly have a variety of origins including ( 1 ) bound interstellar gas in the halo ( or even disk ) of individual galaxies , ( 2 ) tidally stripped debris , ( 3 ) galactic wind ejecta , and ( 4 ) truly intergalactic gas far from galaxies .",
    "our understanding of the absorber - galaxy connection is even more immature , but already it is clear that the systems are strongly correlated with galaxies as well .",
    "several studies have revealed galaxies within a few hundred kpc from systems ( savage , tripp , & lu 1998 ; tripp et al .",
    "2000 ; tripp & savage 2000 ; chen & prochaska 2000 ; tripp et al .",
    "2001 ; savage et al . 2002 ; shull et al . 2003 ; sembach et al .",
    "2004b ; tumlinson et al .",
    "2004 ) . as an example",
    ", figure  [ galaxies ] compares the locations of galaxies found in the redshift survey of tripp et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to the redshifts of and ly@xmath1 lines detected by sembach et al .",
    ". visual inspection of figure  [ galaxies ] suggests that the lines are correlated with the galaxies ( see also figure 21 in sembach et al .",
    "2004b for a striking visual comparison ) , and this is corroborated by statistical tests : sembach et al .",
    "( 2004b ) find that the probability that the absorbers are randomly distributed with respect to the galaxies shown in figure  [ galaxies ] is @xmath32 to @xmath33 ( depending on assumptions made ) . with the advent of powerful multiobject spectrographs on 8 - 10 m telescopes , future studies of the nature of absorbers ( as well as other classes of absorption lines ) and their connections with galaxies hold great promise for understanding the role and implications of these absorbers for galaxy evolution and cosmology .",
    "this research was supported in part by nasa ltsa grant nng04gg73 g .",
    "many of the stis observations were obtained under the auspices of _ hst _ program 9184 , with financial support through nasa grant hst - go-9184.08-a from the space telescope science institute .",
