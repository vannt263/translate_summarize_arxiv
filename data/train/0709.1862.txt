    "supersymmetry ( susy ) has been considered to be the best candidate beyond the standard model ( sm ) from a viewpoint of both the hierarchy problem and the gauge coupling unification .",
    "recent astrophysical observations showing the existence of a substantial amount of non - relativistic and non - baryonic dark matter seem to make susy even more promising .",
    "the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) of r - parity conserving models , in most cases the lightest neutralino , can serve as a good candidate for dark matter ( dm ) .    the parameter space of the constrained mssm , however , is strongly restricted by the requirement of matching the precise measurement of the dm relic density as measured by the wmap .",
    "the mssm also suffers from a naturalness problem ( the so - called @xmath0 problem ) : why the dimensionful parameter @xmath0 of the supersymmetric higgs mass term @xmath1 has to be of ew scale .",
    "this problem can be solved in the next - to - mssm ( nmssm ) by promoting the @xmath0 parameter to a new singlet superfield @xmath2 coupled to higgs doublets , @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this triple - higgs coupling term also helps to push up the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs boson , relaxing the fine - tuning necessary to comply with the lep bounds .",
    "postulating an additional u@xmath4(1 ) gauge symmetry  @xcite avoids a massless axion , or domain wall problems of the nmssm .",
    "such a u(1)-extended mssm ( ussm ) can be considered as an effective low - energy approximation of a more complete e@xmath5ssm model  @xcite , with other e@xmath5ssm fields assumed heavy .",
    "in addition to the mssm superfields , the ussm contains a chiral superfield @xmath6 and an abelian gauge superfield @xmath7 .",
    "thus the mssm particle spectrum is extended by a new cp - even higgs boson @xmath2 , a gauge bozon @xmath8 and two neutral inos : a singlino @xmath9 and a bino @xmath10 ; other sectors are not enlarged . as a result",
    "the phenomenology of the neutralino sector can be significantly modified both at colliders  @xcite and in cosmology - related processes  @xcite . to illustrate this we consider a physically interesting scenario with higgsino and gaugino mass parameters of the order @xmath11  gev ) , and we take the interaction between the singlino and the mssm fields to be of the order of the ew scale , @xmath12  gev ) .",
    "we assume the mssm gaugino unification relation @xmath13 and unified couplings @xmath14 , but @xmath15 will be taken as independent to investigate the impact of new states as a function of @xmath15 . for the numerical values",
    "we take @xmath16 tev , @xmath17 tev , @xmath18 tev , @xmath19 , @xmath20 tev , neglect ( small ) @xmath21-@xmath10 mixing , and adopt the e@xmath5ssm assignment for the u@xmath4(1 ) charges  @xcite .",
    "unlike the 4x4 mssm case , the full 6x6 neutralino mass matrix can not be diagonalised analytically .",
    "however , since the mixing between the new and mssm states is small @xmath22 compared to @xmath23 , one can perform first the diagonalisation of the 4x4 mssm and the 2x2 @xmath9-@xmath10 submatrices separately .",
    "then the perturbative expansion of the block - diagonalisation in @xmath24 provides an excellent approximation to masses and mixings @xcite .",
    "the mass spectrum is shown in fig.[fig : kalinowski1 ] ( left ) as a function of @xmath15 . for small @xmath25 the eigenstates ( denoted by numbers with primes )",
    "are almost pure mssm u(1 ) and su(2 ) gauginos @xmath26 , mssm higgsinos @xmath27 , and maximally mixed u@xmath4(1 ) gaugino and singlino states , @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath25 is shifted to higher values , the mass eigenvalues in the new sector move apart , generating strong cross  over patterns whenever a ( signed ) mass from the new block comes close to one of the ( signed ) mssm masses .",
    "this happens at @xmath29 tev for @xmath30 and @xmath31 states , and at @xmath32 tev for @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for higher @xmath15",

    "@xmath25 the presence of @xmath43 has little influence on @xmath55 which is of similar size as in the mssm for mixed higgsino pairs .",
    "however it significantly enhances diagonal higgsino pairs @xmath56 and @xmath57 compared with the mssm , even though the light neutralino masses are nearly identical in the two models . at and beyond the cross  over with singlino , @xmath58 tev , dramatic changes set in for pairs involving the lightest neutralino .    at the lhc",
    "the neutralinos will be analyzed primarily in cascade decays of squarks or gluinos . in the ussm",
    "the cascade chains may be extended compared with the mssm by an additional step due to the presence of two new neutralino states , for example , @xmath59 with partial decay widths significantly modified by the singlino and bino admixtures .",
    "also the presence of additional higgs boson will influence the decay chains .",
    "moreover , in the cross  over zones the gaps between the masses of the eigenstates become very small suppressing standard decay channels and , as a result , enhancing radiative decays of neutralinos .",
    "these decays are particularly important in the cross  over at @xmath60 , where the radiative modes @xmath61 become non  negligible , see fig.[fig : kalinowski1 ] ( right ) .",

    "the lsp is almost an mssm higgsino and for a mass @xmath63 gev the predicted value falls below the wmap result . as @xmath15 increases , the singlino admixture increases suppressing the lsp annihilation cross section and the predicted relic density increases .",
    "the singlino lsp predominantly annihilates via an off - shell s - channel singlet higgs , which decays to two light higgs bosons .",
    "as @xmath15 increases , the lsp mass decreases and at @xmath64 tev it reaches @xmath65 gev making the resonant annihilation via the heavy higgs boson efficient enough to lower the relic density .",
    "further increase of @xmath25 switches off the heavy higgs resonance and eventually the wmap value is met ( shown as a horizontal band in fig.[fig : kalinowski2 ] ( left ) @xcite ) . around @xmath66",
    "tev the lsp becomes lighter than the light higgs .",
    "this switches off the annihilation via an off - shell singlet higgs , @xmath67 , normally the dominant annihilation mode of a singlino lsp . as a result",
    "the relic density rises sharply . further increasing @xmath15 decreases the lsp mass until it matches the resonant annihilation channels of the light higgs ( at around 14 tev ) and @xmath44 boson ( at around 20 tev ) . in both cases",
    "this results in a significant dip in the relic density .",
    "the singlino nature of the lsp is also of importance for direct dm searches .",
    "it has a strong impact on the elastic spin - independent scattering off the nuclei , e.g. as shown in fig.[fig : kalinowski2 ] ( right )  @xcite for the @xmath62ge nucleus ( the numerical codes have been developed in  @xcite ) . for small @xmath15 the two lightest neutralinos ( 3 and 4 in fig.[fig : kalinowski1 ] ) are almost pure maximally mixed mssm higgsinos .",
    "when @xmath15 increases , the mixing with singlino lowers @xmath68 so that at @xmath69 tev the state 4 becomes the lsp . since the higgsino mixing angles are such that the elastic scattering of the state 4 is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than for the state 3",
    ", it explains a sudden drop seen in fig.[fig : kalinowski2 ] ( right ) . at the same time",
    "the singlino and bino admixture of the lsp increases , which explains a local maximum around 2.8 tev .",
    "as the singlino component ( the state 5 ) of the lsp becomes dominant for higher @xmath15 values , the elastic cross section becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "the u(1 ) extended mssm provides an elegant way of solving the @xmath0 problem . as the neutralino sector is extended , the collider phenomenology can significantly be altered and new scenarios for matching the wmap constraint can be realised .",
    "one example , in contrast to the nmssm , is that the ussm contains regions in which predominantly singlino dark matter can fit the wmap relic density measurement without the need for coannihilation , or resonant s - channel annihilation processes , where the lsp annihilates via @xmath70 .",
