    "fluid - structure interaction ( fsi ) problems have important applications in various areas including bio - fluids and aero - elasticity .",
    "they have been extensively studied from the numerical , as well as analytical point of view @xcite .",
    "a set of popular numerical schemes for fsi in blood flow includes partitioned schemes ( loosely or strongly coupled ) .",
    "partitioned schemes typically solve an underlying multi - physics problem by splitting the problem into sub - problems determined by the different physics in the coupled problem .",
    "in particular , in fluid - structure interaction problems the fluid dynamics and structure elastodynamics are often solved using separate solvers . in loosely coupled schemes",
    "only one iteration between the fluid and structure sub - problem is performed in each time step , while in strongly coupled schemes several sub - iterations between the fluid and structure sub - problems need to be performed at each time step to achieve stability .",
    "the main advantages of _ loosely coupled partitioned schemes _ are modularity , simple implementation , and low computational costs . however , in @xcite it was proved that for certain combinations of physical and geometric parameters ( which are realistic in blood flow ) `` classical '' dirichlet - neumann loosely coupled schemes are unconditionally unstable . in the same paper , the authors showed that this instability is due to the `` added - mass effect '' .",
    "namely , it was shown that a portion of the fluid load to the structure in the coupled fsi problems can be written as an additional inertia term in the structure equation coming from the fluid mass ( added mass ) . in numerical schemes",
    "in which this term appears _ explicitly _ , which is the case in the classical dirichlet - neumann loosely coupled partitioned schemes , the added mass term acts as a source of instabilities when the structure is too `` light '' to counter - balance the kinetic energy of the `` heavy '' fluid load .    to get around these difficulties ,",
    "several different loosely coupled algorithms have been proposed .",
    "the method proposed in  @xcite uses a simple membrane model for the structure which can be easily embedded into the fluid problem where it appears as a generalized robin boundary condition . in this way",
    "the original problem reduces to a sequence of fluid problems with a generalized robin boundary condition which can be solved using only the fluid solver .",
    "a similar approach was proposed in  @xcite where the fluid and structure were split in the classical way , but the fluid and structure sub - problems were linked via novel transmission ( coupling ) conditions that improve the convergence rate .",
    "namely , a linear combination of the dynamic and kinematic interface conditions was used to artificially redistribute the fluid stress on the interface , thereby avoiding the difficulty associated with the added mass effect .    a different approach to stabilization of loosely coupled ( explicit ) schemes was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "there , a stabilization based on nitsche s method  @xcite was used with a time penalty term giving an @xmath2-control on the fluid force variations at the interface .",
    "we further mention the scheme proposed in  @xcite where a robin - robin type preconditioner was combined with krylov iterations for a solution of an interface system .    for completeness",
    ", we also mention several semi - implicit fsi schemes .",
    "the schemes proposed in  @xcite separate the computation of fluid velocity from the coupled pressure - structure velocity system , thereby reducing the computational costs .",
    "similar schemes , derived from algebraic splitting , were proposed in  @xcite .",
    "we also mention  @xcite where an optimization problem is solved at each time - step to achieve continuity of stresses and continuity of velocity at the interface .",
    "recently , a novel loosely coupled partitioned scheme , called the `` kinematically coupled @xmath0-scheme '' , was introduced in @xcite .",
    "this scheme successfully deals with problems associated with the added mass effect in a way different from those reported above .",
    "the kinematically coupled @xmath0-scheme is a modification of the kinematically coupled scheme first introduced in @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 was introduced in @xcite to increase the accuracy .",
    "this parameter distributes the fluid pressure between the fluid and the structure sub - problems . for @xmath3",
    "the entire pressure is considered in the fluid sub - problem giving no pressure loading in the structure sub - problem , while for @xmath4 , the entire fluid pressure is used to load the structure sub - problem .",
    "the case @xmath3 corresponds to the classical kinematically coupled scheme @xcite .",
    "the first version of the scheme , presented in @xcite , concerns fsi problems in which the structure is described by a thin structure model ( a thin membrane or shell model ; elastic or viscoelastic ) .",
    "extensions of the scheme have recently been developed by the authors to handle fsi problems with thick structures modeled by the equations of 2d or 3d elasticity @xcite , and to handle fsi problems with multiple layered structures ( thin - thick - thin - thick  ; elastic or viscoelastic ) @xcite .",
    "modeling fsi with multi - layered structures is particularly useful in the blood flow application since the walls of major arteries are composed of several layers : the _ tunica intima _ , the _ tunica media _ , and the _ tunica adventitia _ ,",
    "separated by the thin elastic laminae .",
    "recently , the authors have used the kinematically - coupled scheme to prove the existence of a weak solution to a fully nonlinear fsi problem between an incompressible , viscous fluid and a thin structure modeled by either the elastic or viscoelastic shell equations @xcite . the existence proof is based on constructing approximate solutions using the kinematically - coupled scheme , and showing that the approximate solutions converge to a weak solution as the time - discretization tends to zero .",
    "this existence result relies on energy estimates which show that in the kinematically - coupled scheme the energy of the coupled fsi problem is well - approximated by the discretized problem .",
    "a consequence of this result is that the kinematically - coupled scheme is stable .",
    "the stability of the kinematically coupled scheme is achieved by a clever splitting of the structure problem into the inertia part ( combined with the viscoelastic part when the ( thin ) structure is viscoelastic ) and the elastic part .",
    "the structure inertia is then used as a boundary condition in the fluid sub - problem , while the elastodynamics part is solved separately .",
    "the inclusion of the structure inertia ( and possibly the viscoelastic part of a thin structure ) into the fluid sub - probem was enabled by an implicit enforcement of the kinematic coupling condition , which enforces the no - slip condition at the fluid - structure interface .",
    "the present manuscript reveals , explicitly , how and why the kinematically - coupled @xmath0-scheme does not suffer from the added mass effect for any @xmath5 .",
    "the method of proof is different from the one presented in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the approach presented in @xcite where it was shown that the classical dirichlet - neumann loosely - coupled scheme is unconditionally unstable .",
    "the result in @xcite was proved on the simplest fsi problem which still retains all the main features responsible for the stability issues associated with the classical loosely coupled schemes .",
    "the present manuscript considers the same test problem for which it is shown that the kinematically - coupled @xmath0-scheme is unconditionally stable for all @xmath6 .",
    "the theoretical results are confirmed by numerical simulations which where used to solve a fully nonlinear benchmark problem in fsi in hemodynamics , originally presented in @xcite and used for testing of various numerical schemes @xcite .",
    "the hemodynamics and structure parameters in this benchmark problem fall into the critical regime for which the classical loosely - coupled dirichlet - neumann schemes are unstable .",
    "our results show that the kinematically - coupled @xmath0-scheme is stable for those parameters , as predicted by the theory .",
    "we also show that the kinematically - couped @xmath0-scheme compares well with the simulations obtained using a monolithic scheme by badia , quaini , and quarteroni @xcite .",
    "further numerical results obtained using the kinematically - coupled @xmath0-scheme and a comparison with experimental measurements can be found in @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section by mentioning the most recent generalization of the kinematically - coupled scheme by fernndez et al .",
    ", called `` the incremental displacement - correction scheme '' @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors prove convergence of this numerical scheme by analyzing a simplified linear model problem .",
    "the incremental displacement - correction scheme threats the structure displacement explicitly in the fluid sub - step and then corrects it in the structure sub - step .",
    "this scheme can also be viewed as a kinematic perturbation of a semi - implicit scheme .",
    "this observation was crucial for proving convergence of the scheme @xcite . a different approach",
    ", however , needs to be used to prove stability of the kinematically coupled @xmath0-scheme due to its particular splitting of the normal stress .",
    "this gives rise to the various difficulties in estimating the pressure terms which can not be handled by using the classical methods presented in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the present manuscript provides an original look at the study of stability of the kinematically coupled @xmath0-scheme .",
    "the method of proof is different from those used in @xcite .",
    "the results of this manuscript provide the information about the stability of the kinematically coupled @xmath0-scheme and its relation to the added mass effect which is not captured by the results in @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by an `` explicit calculation '' of the solution to the simplified fsi problem considered here .",
    "the main contribution of this work is in explicitly showing how the implicit enforcement of the kinematic coupling condition and the inclusion of the structure inertia into the fluid sub - problem avoid the presence of the added mass effect in the kinematically - coupled @xmath0-scheme .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by a description of the kinematically - coupled @xmath0-scheme for a full fsi problem in which the structure is modeled by a cylindrical , linearly viscoelastic membrane shell model , also known as the 1d generalized string model .",
    "see section [ fullproblem ] .",
    "then , a simplified fsi problem is introduced , and the corresponding application of the kinematically coupled @xmath0-scheme is presented , see section [ simplifiedproblem ] .",
    "an analysis showing the reasons why the kinematically coupled @xmath0-scheme does not suffer from the added - mass effect and is unconditionally stable for any @xmath7 , is presented in section  [ proof ] .",
    "numerical results are presented in section [ numericalresults ] where a fully nonlinear fsi benchmark problem in hemodynamics is considered .",
    "stability of the scheme is shown for the parameter values well within the range of instability of dirichlet - neumann schemes .",
    "a remark discussing a comparison with the classical dirichlet - neumann loosely coupled scheme , and a discussion related to the `` added mass effect '' are presented in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the flow of an incompressible , viscous fluid in a channel of radius @xmath8 and length @xmath9 , see figure  [ fig : domain ] . to fix ideas we will be assuming that the channel is a subset of @xmath10 , although none of the ideas related to the definition of the kinematically coupled @xmath0-scheme depend on the dimension of the problem .",
    "the channel reference domain is denoted by @xmath11 and the lateral boundary by @xmath12    the lateral boundary of the channel is assumed to be deformable , with a negligible longitudinal displacement . without loss of generality , we consider only the upper half of the fluid domain with a symmetry boundary condition at the bottom boundary @xmath13 . the fluid domain which depends on time is not known _",
    "a priori_. denote by @xmath14 the fluid domain at time @xmath15 , and the lateral ( top ) boundary by @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the vertical ( radial ) displacement of the lateral boundary .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath18 denote the bottom portion of the boundary , while @xmath19 , @xmath20 denote the inlet and outlet parts , respectively .",
    "we consider the flow of an incompressible , viscous fluid driven by the inlet and outlet pressure data @xmath21 , with the fluid velocity on @xmath22 given by @xmath23 , and the symmetry boundary condition at the bottom part of the boundary .",
    "thus , the * fluid problem * reads : find the fluid velocity @xmath24 and pressure @xmath25 such that @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fluid density , and @xmath28 is the fluid stress tensor . for a newtonian fluid the stress tensor is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fluid viscosity and @xmath31 is the rate - of - strain tensor .",

    ", we consider the kinematically coupled @xmath0-scheme , introduced in @xcite .",

    "we introduce a family of ( arbitrary , invertible , smooth ) mappings @xmath46 defined on the reference domain @xmath47 such that , for each @xmath48 $ ] , @xmath46 maps the reference domain @xmath47 onto the current domain @xmath49 . now",

    "when the structure is viscoelastic , the structural viscosity can be treated together with the structure inertia as a part of the same boundary condition ( i.e. , all the terms in the structure equation involving the trace of fluid velocity on @xmath42 can be used as a boundary condition for the fluid sub - problem ) .",
    "the elastodynamics of the structure problem is solved separately in the structure sub - problem .",

    "part i of the fluid stress is used in the fluid sub - problem , while part ii of the fluid stress ( the @xmath0-fraction of the pressure ) is used to load the structure in the elastodynamics sub - problem .",

    "we show that the kinematically coupled @xmath0-scheme is unconditionally stable when applied to a simplified problem , introduced in @xcite as the simplest problem which captures the main features related to the instabilities in classical loosely - coupled schemes caused by the `` added mass effect '' .",
    "the simplified problem consists of solving the time - dependent stokes equations for an incompressible , inviscid fluid in a 2d channel with deformable walls , and with the elastodynamics equations given by the 1d generalized string model .",
    "moreover , it is assumed that the displacement of the deformable wall is small enough so that it can be neglected in the fluid flow problem . in this case",
    "the geometry of the fluid domain is fixed while the small deformation of the boundary is calculated using the elastodynamics equations which are coupled with the fluid flow through the kinematic and dynamic coupling conditions .",

    "we will be assuming that the inlet and outlet pressure data , which are functions of time , are uniformly bounded .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for the blood flow application , since the pressure is typically a periodic function of time , with a bounded amplitude .",
    "the * fluid problem * reads : find the fluid velocity @xmath90 and pressure @xmath25 such that @xmath91 with the initial velocity and pressure equal to zero .",
    "the * structure problem * is defined by solving for @xmath32 the 1d generalized string model : @xmath92 with boundary conditions @xmath34 , and initial conditions given by the zero initial displacement and zero initial structure velocity .",
    "notice that the simplified problem does not have the viscoelastic terms .",
    "the addition of the viscoelastic terms only contributes to the stability of the scheme . for more details about the analysis of the fully nonlinear fsi problem with and without the viscoelastic terms",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the * coupling * between the fluid and structure is defined by the kinematic and dynamic lateral boundary conditions , which , in this simplified problem , read : @xmath93    the coupled fluid - structure interaction problem can be written as follows :    [ ps1 ] @xmath94    to perform the lie splitting , this system is written as a first - order system by using the kinematic coupling condition to obtain : @xmath95 as before , this point is crucial in order to perform the splitting which gives rise to a stable scheme .",
    "namely , in the fluid sub - problem , which we write next , the structure inertia will be taken into account implicitly in the boundary condition on @xmath42 , which is a crucial ingredient for the stability of the @xmath0-scheme .",
