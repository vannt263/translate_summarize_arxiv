    "it is necessary to consider , in addition to loglinear models , some linear constraints .",
    "loglinear models with linear constraints ( lmlc ) ( see definition [ def1 ] ) and product - multinomial sampling were considered for the first time by haber and brown @xcite .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to consider divergence measures in order to make statistical inference ( estimation and testing ) in the class of lmlc but not only with product - multinomial sampling .",
    "we shall present a joint study for different sampling plans ( multinomial , product - multinomial and poisson ) .",
    "in addition , this article highlights the fact that the choice of additional lineal constraints is another way for nesting lmlc , in contrast to the traditional manner of nesting only log - lineal constraints by reducing the number of columns of the design matrix . from this idea",
    "arises a new way for comparing lmlc that has not been previously considered in any paper and covers the preexistent hypothesis - testing techniques as special case ( this point will be clarified in section [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec1b ]",
    "we shall consider some notation as well as some preliminary concepts that will be important in the other sections of the paper .",
    "we pay special attention to the definition of phi - divergence measures between two non - negative vectors .",
    "section [ sec2 ] is devoted to define and study the minimum phi - divergence estimator of lmlc .",
    "the performed _ constrained estimation method _ will allow us  to retain the advantage of dealing with poisson loglinear models ( specially to become estimation theory easier ) , even we could have , in fact , a multinomial or product - multinomial sampling plan .",
    "moreover by an extension of such a method , if a marginal modeling itself is required , a compact estimation methodology is provided .",
    "as generalization of the constrained maximum likelihood estimation method , the constrained minimum @xmath19-divergence estimation theory for  lmlc is provided .",
    "based also on @xmath19-divergences , in section [ sec34 ]  some  test statistics for lmlc are proposed , specifically section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the problem of goodness - of - fit in lmlc and in section [ sec4 ] the problem of nested hypothesis in lmlc is studied . for both problems the asymptotic distribution of the @xmath19-divergence  test statistics under the null hypothesis",

    "are obtained as special case . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "three hypothesis tests , which share the aim for testing essentially a marginal model , are presented .",
    "the common framework of the lmlc developed in the previous cited sections , will allow us to carry out an easier comparison between them .",
    "an example of the potential versatility of such models  will be shown in remark [ rem1 ] , by considering apparently so different models , such as loglinear models and marginal models , within the same type of models .",
    "some particular cases of loglinear models ( symmetry , quasi - symmetry and ordinal quasi - symmetry ) on one hand , and a marginal model on the other hand ( marginal homogeneity model ) are compared and the exact size and power of their hypothesis testing is analyzed .",
    "by single index notation of @xmath20 we are able to unify a broad class of contingency tables , and by convention the terms of multiway contingency tables can be considered to be located in lexicographical order but by assigning a single index .",
    "for example in the usual double index  notation for a a two - way @xmath21 contingency table @xmath22 , @xmath23 can be expressed by a one - to - one index transformation @xmath24 , and therefore @xmath25 . in a three - way @xmath26 contingency table ,",

    "it is well - known that there are some equivalences between the inferential results associated with the parameters for the three sampling plans ( see for instance or instance in lang @xcite and agresti ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 14.4 ) ) .",
    "the main reason why poisson loglinear model is simpler to handle is based on the independence of the components of the sampling data .",
    "the parameter space is given by@xmath46 where @xmath47 if @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a vector of zeros @xmath50 if @xmath45 ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) .",
    "when @xmath52  a stronger assumption than @xmath53 is taken into account , @xmath54 , and therefore if the first @xmath31 columns @xmath49  for @xmath8  are considered the @xmath55-th term @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) of @xmath18 is referred to the independent term for the model focussed only on the @xmath55-th contingency subtable .",

    "taking into account remark [ rem1 ] , it is important to clarify that apart from the possibility of reproducing all inferential results obtained previously in martn and pardo @xcite , the new results of this paper are important because the lmlc cover a broad range of models .",
