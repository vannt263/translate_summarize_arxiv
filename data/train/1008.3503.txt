    "we , in contrast , are interested in centrality measures that aim at monitoring communication or traffic .",
    "we investigate a centrality measure called _ shortest path betweenness centrality _ @xcite .",
    "this measure can be motivated by the following scenario that relies only on very basic assumptions .",
    "communication occurs between a pair @xmath5 of distinct nodes that is selected uniformly at random among all node pairs . the communication is always established along a shortest @xmath2@xmath3 path where each such path is chosen with equal probability .",
    "the centrality of a node @xmath6 is defined as the probability of detecting the communication , that is , the probability that @xmath6 lies on the communication path .    as a possible application",
    "we refer to the task of placing a server in a computer network so as to maximize the probability of detecting malicious data packets .",
    "another example is the deployment of toll monitoring systems in a road network .    as suggested by the previous application example ,",
    "a natural extension of the above scenario is to measure the probability of detecting communication for a whole set of nodes .",
    "the resulting centrality measure is called _ group betweenness centrality _ @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the problem of finding a given number @xmath0 of nodes such that the group betweenness centrality is maximized .",
    "we call this problem maximum betweenness centrality ( mbc ) .    [",

    "our reduction also allows us to derive a new algorithm for a budgeted version of the problem , which achieves the same approximation factor .",
    "one remarkable property of our reduction is that it is _ not _ a polynomial time reduction .",
    "rather , the reduction is carried out implicitly and aims at analyzing the algorithms .",
    "we show that the analyses of these algorithms can not be improved by providing tight examples ( see section [ sec : tight_examples ] ) .",
    "we also prove that mbc is apx - complete thereby showing that mbc does not admit a ptas ( section [ sec : apx - completeness ] ) .",
    "finally , we develop an exact polynomial - time algorithm for mbc on tree graphs ( see section [ sec : polyn - time - algor ] ) .",

    "therefore , the group betweenness centrality of a set of nodes equals the weight of the corresponding set of shortest paths in the maximum coverage instance . of course the feasible solutions of mbc and the feasible solutions of the reduced instance of maximum coverage are in 1 - 1-correspondence and have the same goal function value .",
    "hence corresponding feasible solutions have also the same approximation ratio for the respective problem instances .",

    "an implementation of the greedy approach for mbc outlined before has been developed by dolev et al.@xcite .",

    "the authors , however , give a modified greedy algorithm with an approximation factor of @xmath45 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the difference to the naive approach is not to start with an empty set @xmath30 but to try all initializations of @xmath30 with at most three sets of @xmath61 that respect the budget bound @xmath12 .",

    "this lower bound , however , does not carry over immediately to mbc because we have only a reduction from mbc to maximum coverage and not the other way round .    in what follows",
