    "are easily identified using even low - resolution x - ray detectors .",
    "however , only 10 galactic objects are listed as supersoft sources   in the latest compilation of greiner ( 2000a ) while population synthesis studies ( di  stefano & rappaport 1994 , yungleson et al .",
    "1996 , di  stefano & nelson 1996 ) predict of order 1000 supersoft sources  could be active in ordinary galaxies like our own .",
    "local objects are therefore of limited use for supersoft sourcepopulation studies .",
    "the best opportunity is to explore nearby galaxies at high galactic latitude where intervening absorption is low , all the sources are at a common distance , a single pointing can detect a large number of sources , and their spatial distribution can be measured .",
    "indeed , surveys conducted using the _ rosat _  and _ einstein _   observatories have identified 8 supersoft sources  in the lmc , 4 in the smc , and 34 in m31 ( see greiner 1996 for a detailed listing ) . the high sensitivity and moderate spectral resolution make the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory an ideal facility to systematically extend supersoft source  population studies to other nearby galaxies .",
    "this is the rationale for the present investigation .",
    "a 50  ks _ chandra _  acis - s imaging observation of the nearby galaxy m81 reveals nine supersoft source  candidates identified by broadband x - ray colors (  [ s : observations ] ) .",
    "four of these sources are located within the old population of bulge stars and all but one of the remainder are coincident with m81 spiral arms .",
    "a search of known objects finds two of the bulge sources are spatially coincident with sources of enhanced [ oiii ] @xmath115007    emission ; consistent with nebulae photoionized by the x - ray sources .",
    "no other spatial correlations were discovered in searches of multiwavelength archival data , contemporary radio and h@xmath12 images , or published source catalogues .",

    "for this purpose , two background spectra were defined for sources on s3 : one for the bulge where contributions from the wings of the psf of the bright nucleus and from a relatively high level of unresolved x - ray emission was previously detected in the data ( tennant et al .",

    "those sources with color values @xmath37 were tenatively classified as supersoft sources .",
    "this criteria selects 10 sources on s3 , two sources on s2 , and none on the remaining ccds .",
    "the list of sources was compared to catalogues of objects to eliminate those with properties inconsistent with supersoft sources .",
    "supernova remnant candidate no .",
    "17 in the catalogue of matonick & fesen ( 1997 ) lies within the positional uncertainty of one of the supersoft source  candidates detected on s3 .",

    "this source is therefore excluded from the list of candidate supersoft sources  even though its colors ( @xmath38 ) lie within our selection criteria .",
    "both candidate sources on s2 are coincident with bright ( @xmath39@xmath59 mag ) g0 stars in the ppm catalogue of stars .",

    "late - type stars with active coronae and am  her - type magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are the only foreground objects with x - ray colors falling within our selection criteria .",
    "foreground late - type stars are easily identified in optical images as their x - ray flux is typically a small fraction of their optical flux .",
    "am  her - type mcvs have a soft component ( @xmath41100  ev ) that may dominate any hard bremsstrahlung ( @xmath42  kev ) component and appear supersoft .",
    "however , their k or m star companions should be visible optically out to distances well beyond the galactic disk in the direction of m81 .",
    "it remains possible that some of the weakest supersoft source  candidates could be very bright cvs , with late m - type companions , and escape optical detection provided they are located some @xmath57  kpc above the plane of the galaxy .        the observed properties of the remaining 9 candidate supersoft sources , all located on the bi s3 device , are listed in table  1 and their positions are shown superimposed on the second generation dss image of m81 in figure  [ f : full - dss - image ] .",
    "hereafter , individual supersoft sources in m81 will be referred to in order of observed brightness , column  1 of table  1 , as source n1 through source n9 .",
    "the lack of candidate supersoft sources  on the fi devices is attributable to the small fraction of m81 falling within the viewing field of the fi devices , to the scarcity of x - ray sources ( of all types ) found far from the central regions of m81 , to the weaker low energy response of the fi devices , and to the decreased off - axis source sensitivity .",
    "the detection limit for supersoft sources  on the fi devices is @xmath43  erg  s@xmath2  or about 6 times brighter than the corresponding limit on the bi device s3 .",
    "none of the candidate supersoft sources  appear extended in the _ chandra _  data .",
    "as listed in table  1 , candidate sources are found throughout the bulge and disk of m81 and several lie within @xmath5200  pc of spiral arms ( @xmath44  kpc for the adopted distance of 3.6  mpc to m81 , freedman et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "while several of the candidate supersoft sources  are in crowded , source - rich regions of this well - studied galaxy , only two can be unequivically identified with catalogued objects observed at other wavelengths based on positional coincidence .",

    "the observed x - ray luminosities of these sources exceeds that of typical planetary nebulae ( @xmath45 to @xmath46  erg  s@xmath2 ) by several orders of magnitude assuming they are at the distance of m81 .",

    "the lack of detectable emission at other wavelengths , particularly in _",

    "the [ oiii ] @xmath115007    emission could come from regions ionized by the x - ray source in a way similar to that observed in the lmc supersoft source  cal  83 ( remillard , rappaport , & macri 1995 ) .",

    "the spectra of all 9 candidate sources are shown in figure  [ f : all_spectra ] .",
    "they typically show a rise from low energies to a peak at @xmath50.45 to @xmath50.7  kev followed by a rapid decline toward higher energies .",
    "the shape of the low - energy portion of the spectra is determined by a combination of extinction and a decreasing acis detection efficiency at low energies . above the peak ,",
    "the shape is determined by a roughly exponential decline of the intrinsic source spectra .    in spectra such as these , the inferred bolometric luminosity is much higher than that observed with the peak of the intrinsic spectral energy distribution occuring at energies lower than observed .",
    "the inferred luminosities are very sensitive to the model parameters and to calibration uncertainties in the low - energy response of the bi devices .",
    "though there is often significant flux below 0.2  kev , data at energies below this value were excluded from the fitting because of these uncertainties .",
    "a sufficient number of counts for spectral analysis were accumulated from only the three brightest sources listed in table  1 .",
    "the spatial regions selected for spectral analysis were chosen centered on each source as described above (  [ s : selection ] ) . accompanying background spectra",
    "were extracted for each source from annular regions centered on the source with inner and outer radii of 30 and 50 pixels , respectively , and containing of order 200 counts .",
    "note this procedure differs from the large background regions selected for constructing the broadband colors described previously .",
    "the procedure used in this section more accurately represents local variations in background .",
    "spectra have been grouped into spectral bins containing a minimum of 20 counts and fitted using the xspec spectral fitting package ( arnaud 1996 ) to blackbody and to model atmosphere spectra of hot white dwarfs calculated in the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) approximation .",
    "the x - ray emission from supersoft sources  is believed to originate from nuclear burning on the surface of a wd star .",
    "the nuclear burning takes place at high optical depth within a geometrically thin , high density atmosphere with the resulting emergent spectrum highly modified by the cooler outer layers . under these conditions ,",
    "hot wd lte model atmosphere spectra is a more appropriate approximation than is a simple blackbody assumption .",
    "therefore , we developed tables of plane - parallel lte model atmospheres as an alternative model for spectral fitting . under certain circumstances",
    "the wd atmosphere may become extended or even partially ejected as a result of rapid nuclear burning .",
    "spectra of extended , expanding , spherical atmospheres tend to be flatter than that from plane - parallel hydrostatic atmospheres with the same color temperature at maximum flux .",
    "model atmospheres including an optically thick wind are currently in preparation .",
    "the fundamental parameters of our plane - parallel lte model atmospheres are the effective temperature , @xmath13 , surface gravity , @xmath48 , and luminosity scale factor @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the bolometric luminosity , @xmath24 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath51 is the distance from the source to the observer .",
    "the model atmospheres were constructed following standard temperature - correction procedures as outlined in mihalas ( 1978 ) in order to satisfy the hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium constraints .",
    "the 15 most abundant elements from h  through ni  are included with bound - free opacities computed from the photoionization cross sections of verner et al .",
    "( 1993,1995 ) .",
    "line blanketing is included using @xmath51200 of the strongest spectral lines from the chianti ( v.3.0 ) atomic database ( dere et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "a series of lte model atmosphere spectra were constructed in this fashion spanning the range of parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53  log(@xmath48 )  @xmath54 , as appropriate for wd atmospheres , with the scale factor @xmath55 used as the model normalization in xspec .",
    "tables of these models were used in conjunction with a photoelectric absorption component in fitting to the observed spectra .",
    "a separate table was constructed for each of two values of photospheric metal abundances , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , relative to the solar composition given by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "the lower metal abundance is roughly compatible with the observed m81 metallicities ( @xmath50.03 ) recently reported by kong et al .",
    "in addition , a he - rich model consisting of @xmath58 metals and 99% he by weight was also constructed .    for reference , computed hot wd lte model atmosphere spectra at several temperatures are shown in figure  [ f : lte_models ] .",
    "many of the edges seen in these spectra will prove key diagnostics of the properties of the candidate supersoft sources .",
    "the spectral fit results for the brightest supersoft source  candidate , source n1 , are listed in table  2 .",
    "this and subsequent tables for the other bright sources include one column for each model .",
    "rows list the @xmath59 fit statistic , the fitted model parameters @xmath60 ( hydrogen column density ) , @xmath13 ( blackbody or effective temperature ) , log(@xmath48 ) ( surface gravity ) , @xmath61 ( absorption edge energy ) and the accompanying @xmath62 ( edge optical depth ) .",
    "all models include photoelectric absorption from a solar abundance column . in the case of model _ zvarabs _ , the abundance of c and o in the absorbing column are allowed to vary .",
    "the table lists the enhancement of these elements relative to the solar values .",
    "also listed are the observed luminosity , @xmath18 , in the 0.22.0  kev band , the unabsorbed luminosity , @xmath63 , in the same band and the bolometric luminosity , @xmath15 , as scaled from the model normalizations assuming a distance of 3.6 mpc to m81 .    the observed spectrum , best - fit absorbed blackbody model with added absorption edge at 0.26  kev ( second model of table  2 ) , and fit residuals for source n1 are shown in figure  [ f : sn1_spectralfit ] .",
    "a simple blackbody model is statistically superior to either of the lte wd atmosphere models because of the lack of absorption edges in the observed spectrum .",
    "however , there is a feature in the blackbody fit residuals near 0.3 kev .",
    "this feature can be modelled as an edge at @xmath64  kev ( second column of table 2 ) which is very close to the neutral c k - edge at 0.277  kev .",
    "since there is no reason to expect the galactic absorbing column to have exactly solar abundances , we also tried a variable abundance model .",
    "if a small `` redshift '' ( z=0.04 ) is applied , this model also provided an excellent fit to the data as shown by the third column in table 2 .",
    "it is worth noting that the acis energy scale is uncertain at the lowest energies and thus the feature is likely a carbon edge and the `` redshift '' is due to this uncertainty .",
    "as the acis response is also uncertain at these energies we can not determine whether the excess carbon is intrinsic to the source in m81 , lies within our galaxy , or is a detector effect .",
    "lte models with an additional raymond - smith thermal emission component are an improvement over the single lte component models because this added thermal component tends to fill the @xmath50.71.0  kev region of the model spectrum underestimated due to the presence of absorption edges in the lte component . while the physical basis for such a thermal component has precedence in modeling of , _",
    "e.g. _ , the recurrent nova u  sco ( kahabka et al .  1999 ) and the symbiotic nova smc  3 ( jordan et al .",
    "1996 ) , and there is reason to believe source n1 may be near a state of dynamical outflow ( see discussion in  [ s : discussion ] ) , the fact that a simple blackbody model provides an equally - acceptable fit allows one to conclude that the thermal component is not necessary .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath52% of the incident flux at 0.5  kev is piled up in the spectrum of source n1 resulting in detected events near 1  kev .",
    "the observed flux at 1.01.1  kev is 3.5% of that in the 0.50.55  kev band .",
    "thus some 60% of the observed flux at 1.01.1  kev is due to pileup .",
    "he - rich lte model atmospheres were also fitted to this spectrum but no statistically - acceptable fits were obtained and they are omitted from table  2 for brevity .",
    "the larger he opacity near the heii edge in these models leads to a slightly lower temperature and a slightly steeper temperature gradient in spectrum - forming ( 0.1@xmath651 , where @xmath66 is the rosseland mean opacity ) regions of the atmosphere .",
    "the emergent flux therefore decreases near the heii edge ( due to lower temperatures ) and increases slightly at the peak of the spectral energy distribution ( due to the steeper gradient ) .",
    "the overall effect in the _ chandra _  observable energy band is to produce a steeper spectrum than the h - rich lte models .",
    "the spectrum is further steepened by the bound - free edges from intermediate - mass metals resulting in a poorer model of the data .",
    "the blackbody shape of the observed spectrum of source n1 is reminiscent of that expected from a geometrically thin optically thick accretion disk surrounding a black hole ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "for completeness , therefore , an accretion disk emission model was also fitted to the observations .",
    "this model accumulates the spectrum from an optically thick accretion disk observed at inclination angle @xmath8 from a superposition of blackbody spectra from concentric annular elements representing the radial dependence of the disk temperature profile ( mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 , makishima et al .  1986 ) .",
    "the model parameters ( model _ diskbb _ , table 2 ) are the normalization , proportional to the innermost disk radius , @xmath67 , for a known inclination angle and distance to the source , and the temperature at @xmath67 . assuming @xmath67 corresponds to the last stable keplerian orbit ( makishima et al .",
    "2000 ) implies a mass for the central object .",
    "the best - fit normalization for source n1 corresponds to a black hole mass @xmath68@xmath51200/(cos@xmath69 assuming the last stable orbit is at 3  schwarzschild radii .",
    "the best - fit temperature at @xmath67 , @xmath70@xmath5100  ev , implies a bolometric luminosity @xmath15@xmath5@xmath71  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "not surprisingly , the color temperature @xmath70 is slightly higher than that obtained from the blackbody models .",
    "the shape of the blackbody disk model is a power law of photon index @xmath72 at low photon energies steepening to the wien portion of a blackbody of temperature @xmath73 at higher energies ( makishima et al .",
    "thus the combination of an innermost disk radius temperature slightly higher than the blackbody model temperature and a higher absorption column density is just what is needed to make the disk blackbody model mimic a standard blackbody spectrum .",
    "this is especially true in view of the fact that only the steep wien portion of the spectrum lies within the _ chandra _  energy band for low values of @xmath70 and the power law portion of the blackbody disk model spectrum lies entirely below the low - energy instrumental cutoff .",
    "the lack of detectable emission at longer wavelengths at the position of source n1 (  [ s : environments ] ) and the lack of an observable hard power - law tail argues against the blackbody disk model .",
    "the luminosity of source n1 is exceptionally high .",
    "the observed 0.22.0  kev luminosity , @xmath18@xmath5@xmath16  erg  s@xmath2 , is slightly above the eddington limit for a 1.4 m@xmath7  h - accreting star .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosity on the same energy range and the inferred bolometric luminosities are much higher though with high uncertainties .",
    "in contrast , @xmath18 is tightly constrained and its value does not vary among the models ( table  2 ) .",
    "another source of uncertainty , independent of model fit uncertainties , is the gain behavior in the bi device at low photon energies and at the -120@xmath27c focal plane temperature in use at the time of observation .",
    "very nearly 1/3 of the observed flux from source n1 falls in the 0.20.4  kev energy band .",
    "a 20% uncertainty in the flux below 0.4  kev corresponds , therefore , to an additional 7% uncertainty in @xmath18 .",
    "conservatively , then , the estimated bolometric luminosity of source n1 is at least several times @xmath10 erg  s@xmath2  and , depending on the model , may be as high as a few @xmath71 erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "this result places severe constraints on physical models for this source (  [ s : discussion ] ) .",
    "it is notable that the large range of @xmath74 and @xmath15 is not obviously reflected in a large range of the model fit parameters @xmath60 and @xmath13 . from table  2 ,",
    "the range of these parameters among the various models ( excluding _ diskbb _ ) are @xmath75  @xmath76 and @xmath77  ev .",
    "this substantiates the previous conjecture that the inferred luminosities are very sensitive to small variations in the model parameters .",
    "however , the differences in shape of the blackbody and lte model atmosphere spectra do not give systematically large differences in the derived temperatures , column densities , and luminosities as is often reported for supersoft sources .",
    "the hot wd lte model parameter log(@xmath48 ) is directly related to the mass of the assumed white dwarf .",
    "the resulting white dwarf mass is estimated to be 0.9 to 1.1 m@xmath7  for source n1 .",
    "the spectral fit results for source n2 are listed in table  3 . the observed spectrum , best - fit lte atmosphere model , and fit residuals are shown in figure  [ f : sn2_spectralfit ] .",

    "assuming the source is exiting an eclipse phase during the last @xmath5300  s of the short exposure , then the eclipse lasts only of order 1800  s. the orbital period must then be of order a few hours only since @xmath515% of the period is spent in eclipse .",
    "a period this short could not be missed in the 50  ks observation .",
    "alternatively , nuclear burning on the surface of a wd may be occuring through weak shell flashes that either cause expansion which quenches burning or expels material which obscures the underlying atmosphere as it cools with more violent flashes followed by a larger flux decline .",

    "nevertheless , the spectrum is definitely harder ( or , hotter in the context of blackbody spectral models ) during this bright phase .",
    "there is no clear signature of increasing absorption as the source enters the low rate region of the 2.4  ks light curve as would be expected in the onset of an eclipse .",
    "no other source shows a similar harder spectrum during the 2.4  ks observation .",
    "the other alternative discussed previously in the context of spectral models for source n1 is x - ray emission from an accretion disk around a mid - mass black hole .",
    "variability on many timescales is observed in both massive black holes ( agns ) and in stellar - mass black holes ( x - ray transients ) .",

    "although source n1 has x - ray properties similar to those of u  sco , it is unlikely that source n1 is a nova .",
    "novae occur in systems with relatively low mass transfer rates where a layer of fuel is accumulated for a period of time before compressional heating causes ignition .",

    "if the outcome of a high mass transfer rate is formation of an envelope then this system should be observable optically as a hot giant or red giant star , contrary to the _ hubble _  observations (  [ s : environments ] ) and not as a strong x - ray source .",

    "visual magnitudes of novae can be as high as @xmath137 to 23 at the distance of m81 but the visible light rapidly declines after maximum light as the spectrum hardens and the x - ray flux rises . a 0.6  m@xmath7  wd nova , for instance , only becomes x - ray visible @xmath54  yr after optical outburst .",

    "the estimated @xmath15 corresponds to a range of wd masses @xmath99@xmath50.7 to @xmath138 . however , wds in this mass range should be considerably cooler ( @xmath139  ev ) than the 4050  ev temperatures suggested by the instrumental selection effect .",
    "below @xmath99@xmath50.65  m@xmath7 , the photospheric radius expands in the steady nuclear burning case and @xmath13 plummets ( iben 1982 ) .",

    "this was shown to be , in part , a natural consequence of the higher sensitivity of _ chandra _  to the high - temperature region of the supersoft source  distribution .",
    "bolometric luminosities deduced here from the spectral fits often exceed the eddington limit for spherical accretion onto a 1.4 m@xmath7  star .",
    "such extreme luminosities lie beyond the previously - observed distribution of supersoft sources  and , more importantly , can not be reconciled with prevailing theories for supersoft sources  as wds powered by stable , steady - state , surface nuclear burning .",
    "but , the study of supersoft sources  with the _ chandra _  observatory is still in its infancy .",
    "important uncertainties remain . as in the _ rosat _  era ,",
    "spectral modeling remains problematic .",
    "simple blackbody models , like those used in this work , are known to greatly overestimate bolometric luminosities in some cases .",
    "lte model atmospheres , also applied here , are appropriate when a well - defined photosphere is present such as in the high density gradient at the surface of a wd .",
    "even this model fails when the nuclear burning is near the stability limit , the atmosphere becomes extended , and a wind drives mass loss as may be the case in the brightest supersoft source  candidate in m81 .",
    "in addition , the energy calibration of the bi devices at low photon energies is uncertain and could also have a significant effect on the results reported here .",
    "many of these uncertainties may be resolved or at least mitigated as pending _",
    "_  observations of well - studied supersoft sources  are analyzed and compared to previous observations and to specific theoretical expectations .",
    "high - resolution grating spectroscopy will be indispensible in this regard as many of the calibration uncertainties can be circumvented while , at the same time , models for the x - ray spectra can be more tightly constrained .",
    "an example of the richness of such a spectrum is that of cal  83 obtained by xmm - newton / rgs ( paerels , et al .",
    "the population of supersoft source  candidates discovered in m81 also reveals the value of isolating sources to investigate their local environments and of obtaining precise locations for future observations at x - ray and other wavelengths .    in spite of the current uncertainties ,",
    "the remarkable properties deduced for the brightest supersoft source  candidate in m81 should not be overlooked .",
    "this source exhibits large variations in x - ray brightness on timescales of order hours yet maintains a high average x - ray brightness throughout the roughly 8 year span of combined _ rosat _  and _ chandra_observations of the region . in the context of the nuclear burning wd scenario ,",
    "its high temperature and luminosity imply a high mass , near the chandrasekhar limit for wds , and a high accretion rate , above that for steady - state nuclear burning .",
    "while optical monitoring would be difficult , at best , future observations are strongly encouraged to more fully understand this source .",
    "the accurate location provided in table  1 should aid substantially in this regard .",
    "the most extensive study of supersoft sources  in an external spiral galaxy similar to our own and m81 is the _ rosat _  survey of m31 ( supper et al .",
    "1997 , kahabka 1999 ) . based on hardness ratios , supper et al.(1997 ) identified 15 supersoft source  candidates",
    "not associated with snrs or foreground objects in a 6.3 square degree m31 field .",
    "kahabka ( 1999 ) , using a slightly modified selection criteria , identified an additional 26 candidates in the field .",
    "kahabka ( 1999 ) found a total of 7 of the combined 41 supersoft sources  are within the @xmath56  kpc bulge of m31 with the remainder evenly distributed over @xmath512 to 25  kpc radii .",
    "the lack of detected sources in the region @xmath56 to 12  kpc was explained as a consequence of a higher h column within this annulus .",
    "kahabka ( 1999 ) suggests that the spatial distribution favors a disk population of younger stars by comparing to the populations of cepheids and ( older ) blue stars .",
    "the supersoft source  distribution does not follow that of novae which are bulge - dominated and follow the old stellar population found in the bulge .",
    "after accounting for possible foreground objects and snrs , kahabka ( 1999 ) finds 1 bulge source for every 47 disk sources .",
    "this is marginally less than reported here for m81 where 4 bulge sources were found for an extrapolated total population of 9/0.57@xmath516 supersoft sources  within the @xmath26 area of m81 .",
    "kahabka ( 1999 ) also estimates the temperatures for all the sources and finds they range from @xmath53060  ev , typically , up to @xmath573  ev for the recurrent transient rx  j0045.4 + 4154 .",

    "again , these values are consistent with those estimated here for the weak sources in m81 although , as shown above , a temperature of order 4050  ev is expected on the basis of instrumental selection effects and the shape of the parent population estimated from population synthesis models .",

    "these comparisons are intriguing .",
    "they suggest that perhaps there is another supersoft source  population of anomolously x - ray bright and hot objects in nearby galaxies similar to our own .",
    "care must be exercised , of course , as there are , to date , only a handful of objects with these properties , no corroborating evidence in support of this conjecture from other wavebands , and no satisfatory theory predicting such extreme x - ray behavior .",
    "these comparisons also suggest a trend across the hubble sequence with fewer supersoft sources  in early type galaxies compared to late types .",

    "<S> a _ chandra _  acis - s imaging observation of the nearby galaxy m81 ( ngc 3031 ) reveals 9 luminous soft x - ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> the local environments , x - ray spectral properties , and x - ray light curves of the sources are presented and discussed in the context of prevailing physical models for supersoft sources . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the sample falls within expectations based on population synthesis models taken from the literature though the high observed luminosities ( @xmath0 to @xmath1 erg - s@xmath2 in the 0.22.0  kev band ) and equivalent blackbody temperatures ( @xmath3 to 80  ev ) place the brightest detected m81 objects at the high luminosity end of the class of supersoft sources  defined by previous _ rosat _  and _ einstein _   studies of nearby galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this is interpreted as a natural consequence of the higher sensitivity of _ chandra _  to hotter and more luminous systems . </S>",
    "<S> most of the sources can be explained as canonical supersoft sources , accreting white dwarfs powered by steady surface nuclear burning , with x - ray spectra well - fit by hot white dwarf local thermodynamic equilibrium atmosphere models . </S>",
    "<S> an exceptionally bright source is scrutinized in greater detail as its estimated bolometric luminosity , @xmath4 erg  s@xmath2 , greatly exceeds theoretical estimates for supersoft sources . </S>",
    "<S> this source may be beyond the stability limit and undergoing a phase of mass outflow under extreme conditions . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , a model in which the observed x - ray spectrum arises from an accretion disk around a blackhole of mass @xmath51200/(cos@xmath6 m@xmath7(viewed at an inclination angle @xmath8 ) can not be excluded . </S>"
