    "it can be shown using the standard calculus optimization technique that of all rectangles with a given perimeter , the square has the largest area .",
    "( it also follows that of all rectangles with a given area , the square has the smallest perimeter . )",
    "there is also an easy geometric way to prove this .",
    "the picture below shows two rectangles : one of them , @xmath0 , is a square , and the other , @xmath1 , is not .",
    "they have the same perimeter ( @xmath2 ) , but the square has a larger area since the areas of the shaded parts are equal , but the square also contains a region that the other rectangle does not .",
    "the above area inequality can also be seen algebraically : @xmath3    as proved on p. 50 in @xcite , even among all quadrilaterals with a given perimeter , the square has the largest area .",
    "we can ask a similar question in 3d : of all rectangular prisms with the given volume , which one has the smallest surface area ? or , equivalently , of all rectangular prisms with the given surface area , which one has the largest volume ?",
    "the answer to both of these questions is a cube .",
    "notice that these problems are too general for a single variable calculus course : there are too many degrees of freedom .",
    "namely , there are three unknowns ( three dimensions ) , but only one constraint ( the given surface area or the given volume ) .",
    "so typically in the first semester calculus class we only consider the 2-variable problem of optimizing a square prism .",
    "this would actually be sufficient for our work below , however , we ca nt resist the temptation to show our reader the following geometric argument that works for all rectangular prisms .",
    "suppose we have any rectangular prism that is not a cube .",
    "choose any face that is not a square and make it the base .",
    "consider the square that has , say , the same area .",
    "it will have a smaller perimeter .",
    "construct a prism with the same height as the original one :        it will have the same volume but a smaller surface area !",
    "( it will have the same volume because both the area of its base and its height are the same as those of the original prism ; and a smaller surface area because the areas of the base and the top are the same but the area of the sides is smaller since the perimeter of the base is smaller . )",
    "thus a prism that is not a cube can not have the smallest possible surface area among all rectangular prisms with a fixed volume .",
    "now we are ready to consider some more interesting problems .",
    "some version of the following rectangular field optimization problem can be found in almost every calculus textbook ( see e.g. exercise 7 on p. 337 in @xcite ; example 1 on p. 258 in @xcite looks different at first , but actually is an equivalent optimization problem ) .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the reader is invited to check that the optimal dimensions are @xmath4{500/\\pi}$ ] cm and @xmath5{500/\\pi}$ ] cm .",
    "@p8.9cm@p3cm@      notice that in the optimal can @xmath6 , and the same relationship holds for an optimal square prism box if we let @xmath7 be the distance from the center of the base to any side ( note that @xmath7 is the radius of the inscribed circle , called the inradius of the square ; the line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the middle of any side is also called its apothem ) . &    is this a coincidence",
    "? we will show that it is not , but rather these two problems ( optimizing the can and optimizing the square prism ) are equivalent .",
    "let us see how the volume and the surface area of the can and the square prism are related : @xmath8",
    "so @xmath9 now , @xmath10    notice that the expressions for both surface areas contain twice the area of the base , and @xmath11 .",
    "if only the other two terms in these expressions were related in the same way , namely , if @xmath12 was @xmath13 times larger than @xmath14 , that would mean that @xmath15 was also @xmath13 times larger than @xmath16 , which , in turn , would mean that the two problems are equivalent .",
    "so here is our question : is @xmath17 ? it is easy to see that these quotients are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , so indeed they are equal .",
    "but is that a coincidence , or is there something deeper here ?",
    "why @xmath17 ?",
    "let us rewrite the above equation as follows : @xmath20",
    ".    now look again at the above equation in terms of @xmath7 : @xmath21 . on each side ,",
    "the denominator is the derivative of the numerator !",
    "this property is briefly illustrated below , while its formal proof for any regular polygon is given in @xcite and a more general case is explored in @xcite .",
    "imagine increasing the radius of a circle by @xmath22 ( see picture below ) .",
    "its area is increased by @xmath23 .",
    "that s why the derivative of the area is @xmath24 .",
    "the same is true for the square !",
    "now , both areas ( of the circle and of the square ) are quadratic power functions of @xmath7 .",
    "for any two quadratic power functions , say , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , their derivatives are @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively , so the ratios of the function to its derivative would be @xmath29 .",
    "it does not matter what the coefficient @xmath30 or @xmath31 is , since it appears in both the function and its derivative and gets canceled in the ratio .",
    "so the above observation is not at all a coincidence .",
    "moreover , as we will see in the next section , this applies to any prism that has a regular polygon as the base !",
    "suppose we want to construct a box in the shape of some other prism whose base is a regular polygon",
    ". what would be the optimal shape then ?",
    "for example , given the desired volume , what ratio of the height @xmath32 to the inradius @xmath7 would minimize the surface area ( and thus minimize the amount of material needed ) ?        as we know , area grows proportionally to the square of the length .",
    "therefore , the area of any regular polygon is a square function of the inradius , i.e. of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is some constant .",
    "the perimeter of the polygon is then @xmath35 .",
    "this means that both the volume and the surface area of any such prism differ from those of a square prism by a constant multiple ( namely , @xmath36 ) , thus the problem of optimizing any such box is equivalent to the problem of optimizing a square prism .",
    "so , in all cases the optimal shape is the one for which @xmath6 !",
    "the following is a modification of problem 9 on p. 979 in @xcite .        of all ellipses inscribed in a semi - circle of radius 1 , find the one with the largest possible area .",
    "hint : if the semicircle is given by the equation @xmath37 , @xmath38 , the ellipse should have equation of the form @xmath39 . &",
    "let us dig a bit deeper and calculate the points of intersection of the ellipse with the semicircle .",
    "they are @xmath42 .",
    "notice that these are exactly vertices of the largest - area rectangle inscribed in a semi - circle ( see e.g. example 5 on p. 336 in @xcite ; see also p. 130",
    "in @xcite for a generalization of this problem ) :          are the problems of optimizing the ellipse and optimizing the rectangle inscribed in a semi - circle equivalent ?",
    "it certainly appears so , but what do the inscribed ellipse and the inscribed rectangle have in common ?",
    "try to figure it out",
