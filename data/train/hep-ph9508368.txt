    "the soft particle production in a very high energy hadron - hadron or nucleus - nucleus collision is an interesting phenomenon .",
    "occasionally , the collision creates a large number of low energy ( small @xmath6 ) particles , mainly pion quanta , initially populating in a small interaction volume and subsequently undergoing a rapid expansion .",
    "the perturbative qcd is not applicable in describing the dynamics since it involves a large number of quanta and the interactions are highly nonlinear .",
    "one may anticipate some novel dynamical feature of the nonperturbative qcd . although there is some evidence that the @xmath6 distribution of these particles follows the scaling law with an effective temperature ,",
    "it is not clear whether or not these low energy particles can actually thermalize so that their distribution can be described by thermodynamics .",
    "in fact , some deviation from the thermal distribution in the very small @xmath6 region , say , @xmath7 mev , has been observed though data are poor in this region at present .    on the other hand , it has been suggested , first by horn and silver @xcite , that these low energy pions may be described by a classical theory .",
    "the number ( @xmath8 ) of quanta involved is large , the quantum fluctuation is suppressed by @xmath9 . in addition , the low energy theorem on the pion - pion scatterings dictates that the quantum corrections to the scattering amplitudes are suppressed by a factor of @xmath10 .",
    "more recently , a scenario of disoriented chiral condensate @xcite suggests that these low energy pions may be out of equilibrium and undergo a quench following a chiral phase transition , and their interactions should be described by the classical chiral dynamics .    in this paper , we shall determine the possible classical field evolutions that these low energy pions may follow based on the nonlinear @xmath0-model .",
    "the advantage of the _ nonlinear _",
    "@xmath0-model over the _ linear _",
    "@xmath0 model is that the constraint of the vacuum expectation value on the fields is built in and that the pion fields always describe the massless modes irrespective of the vacuum orientation in the background .",
    "the @xmath0 mass is taken to be infinity so the low energy structure of the theory is evident .",
    "we have obtained in an analytic form a class of classical solutions to the nonlinear @xmath0-model in @xmath1 space - time dimensions as the candidates of the disoriented chiral condensate in qcd .",
    "our general solutions have a transverse momentum distribution and need not be subject to a boost - invariance constraint .",
    "the solution with a nonuniform isospin orientation is constructed by the chiral @xmath11 rotation from a uniformly oriented solution . in the limit of a boost invariance and no transverse momentum ,",
    "our solutions reduce to those of blaizot and krzywicki @xcite .",
    "we study the distribution of the neutral pion fraction @xmath12 for the pions that disintegrate from the disoriented vacua .",
    "we find that the distribution dp / df = 1/(2@xmath13 holds for the uniformly oriented vacua and also for the boost - invariant vacua with an infinitely large uniform spread in the transverse direction , but it does not hold for the vacuum whose isospin orientation is nonuniform in space - time",
    ". however this distribution should be correct if one selects pions from within a small region in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plot event by event .",
    "this conclusion is reached through the analysis using the classical field theory method and also by studying the quantum pion states .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in sec .  2 ,",
    "we start with the analysis for the boost - invariant solutions with no transverse momentum . in sec .  3",
    ", we make the observation that all solutions with a nonuniform isospin orientation are obtained by the chiral rotations from a uniformly oriented solution whose energy is degenerate with the nonuniform ones . in sec .  4 , we give a general solution with a uniform isospin orientation , from which we can obtain the nonuniform solutions by the chiral rotations according to the prescription given in sec .",
    "the general solution has a nontrivial transverse momentum distribution and is not subject to the boost - invariance constraint . in sec .  5 ,",
    "we examine the charge distribution of the pions disintegrating from these disoriented vacua .",
    "the picture of classical field theory leading to the distribution dp / df = 1/(2@xmath13 does not apply to the nonuniformly oriented vacua except in the boost invariant limit with zero transverse momentum . for a general solution which has rapidity and transverse momentum dependence , the distribution holds only within each small segment in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plot .",
    "the charge distribution is also studied from the viewpoint of quantum multipion states , following horn and silver @xcite .",
    "the modification of the distribution is attributed to the fact that for the general nonuniform solution , more than one orbital state is available for pions to occupy so that there are many different ways to construct multipion states .",
    "in high energy hadron or nucleus collisions , the configurations approximately invariant along the collision axis are of particular interest .",
    "we first focus on this class of solutions ignoring the transverse spatial dependence .",
    "we choose a _ nonlinear _ @xmath0-model as the dynamical model for qcd at low energy .",
    "the solutions that we obtain in this section are equivalent to those of blaizot and krzywicki @xmath16 though they are dervied in a slightly different way in order to clarify a relation between the uniformly oriented solutions and the nonuniformly oriented ones which plays an important role when we extend our argument to the more general case later .",
    "the phase and radial representation of the nonlinear @xmath0-model is , @xmath17 no matter what values the classical phase fields take , the state remains at the bottom of the potential valley because @xmath18 .",
    "this facilitates greatly the search for the dcc - type solutions which are realized at the bottom of potential well .",
    "define the pion field @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an unit isovector field obeying @xmath21 .",
    "alternatively one defines @xmath22 by @xmath23 with the constraint @xmath24 . in this case",
    "the pion fields are given by @xmath25 . in either case , @xmath26 determines the isospin orientation of the pion field .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 transforms like @xmath29 under @xmath30 rotations .",
    "in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath20 , the lagrangian is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a lagrange multiplier .",
    "we will not include an explicit chiral symmetry breaking throughout this paper .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations are @xmath34 @xmath35 the chiral @xmath36 symmetry assures the conservation of the vector and axial - vector currents . in terms of @xmath37 and @xmath26 ,",
    "the current conservation is written as @xmath38 @xmath39 the isospin current conservation ( 7 ) follows also from ( 6 ) , while the axial - vector current conservation ( 8) can be derived from ( 5 ) by repeated use of @xmath40 .",
    "( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) are most general with no assumptions or approximations made .",
    "we consider a boost - invariant case in 1 + 1 dimensions where the fields @xmath31 and @xmath20 are only functions of the variable @xmath41 : @xmath42 for a function only of @xmath41 , a partial derivative @xmath43 is equal to @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the current conservation relations can be integrated into @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are constant vectors in the isospin space whose magnitudes are denoted as @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "it is immediately obvious from ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are orthogonal to each other : @xmath53 the isovector field @xmath54 stays perpendicular to @xmath49 as @xmath41 varies . by multiplying ( 10 ) with @xmath26",
    "vectorially and using @xmath55 , one obtains @xmath56 a standard equation for a vector @xmath26 to precess around a constant vector @xmath49 .",
    "the precession frequency @xmath57 varies with the proper time @xmath41 .",
    "the relations among @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath26 are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "squaring ( 11 ) gives @xmath58 eliminating @xmath59 from the these equations , one obtains the differential equation for @xmath60 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 15 ) combined contain the same information as the first integrals of the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath37 and @xmath26 so that we may proceed with the current conservation laws .",

    ", one obtains the general solution for @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath54 and @xmath50 both lie in the plane perpendicular to @xmath49 , it is convenient to express the unit isovector field @xmath54 in terms of a single angle @xmath67 measured from the direction of @xmath50 : @xmath68 the solution for @xmath69 can be expressed in terms of @xmath60 @xmath70 the dcc configuration may be obtained from the boost - invariant solution multiplied by a step function @xmath71 : @xmath72 such that the causality condition is satisfied .",
    "our solutions should only apply to the inside of the light - cone .",
    "once @xmath73 is inserted , there appears a source on the light cone at @xmath74 which triggers the formation of a dcc .",
    "the energy density @xmath75 of our solution is singular as we approach the light cone : @xmath76 for both the uniform and nonuniform solutions .",
    "the isospin vectors @xmath49 and @xmath50 enter the energy density in the combination of @xmath77 as required by @xmath11 invariance .",
    "the lowest energy solution of @xmath78 is a trivial solution obtained from ( 16 ) , ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) by taking the limit of @xmath79 : @xmath80 blaizot and krzywicki @xcite expressed the pion fields by @xmath81 .",
    "if we choose our @xmath82 condition such that @xmath83 , that is , @xmath84 , our general solution given by ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) coincides with theirs .",
    "in this section we focus on the relation between the space - time dependence of the isovector field @xmath26(x ) and @xmath11 invariance of the lagrangian .",
    "it is easy to see in ( 18 ) that our solutions have a uniform isospin orientation when the isospin vector @xmath49 vanishes .",
    "when @xmath85 , @xmath86 , that is , @xmath26 points to the direction of @xmath50 for all uniform dcc s .",
    "because of the @xmath11 invariance , it is always possible to rotate the vector @xmath49 by an appropriate axial rotation to the direction of the vector @xmath50 .",
    "after the rotation the solution has a uniform isospin orientation and is degenerate in energy with the nonuniform solution prior to the rotation .",
    "it is not unfamiliar that if a system possesses some symmetry , a set of infinitely many new solutions may be obtained by making the symmetry transformation on a single solution .",
    "to be explicit in the present case , let us rotate a uniform solution @xmath87 where @xmath88 is space - time independent . upon a general chiral rotation parametrized by @xmath89 and @xmath90 ,",
    "the uniform solution is rotated into @xmath91 .",
    "the transformed @xmath37 and @xmath26 fields are given by @xmath92 and @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 stand for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively , and so forth , while @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "for an isospin rotation , we choose @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "we have obtained in sec .  2 all nonuniform solutions by solving explicitly the nonlinear differential equations .",
    "we have shown that they are all related by the axial rotations to the nonuniform solutions with the same energy density @xmath75 .",
    "all possible solutions are exhausted in this way .",
    "even without boost invariance , it is straightforward to solve for the uniformly oriented solutions . once we obtain a uniform solution , we can transform it into the nonuniform solutions by @xmath11 rotations .",

    "2 are also valid in the boost - noninvariant case .",
    "we look for the uniform solution in which @xmath110 so that @xmath111 . in this case",

    "the z - axis is chosen along the collision axis of the initial hadrons .",
    "note that the meaning of variable @xmath41 is a little different from the 1 + 1 dimensional case .",

    "if we require that the solution be regular on the collision axis @xmath120 , the neumann functions are excluded .",
    "note however that a singular behavior means an infinite oscillation toward @xmath121 , not an indefinite increase , in terms of the pion field @xmath122 .",
    "one may also require that @xmath123 should not increase indefinitely as @xmath124 . with these requirements",
    ", the parameter @xmath125 defined by @xmath126 must be positive .",

    "@xmath128 is expressed in terms of the bessel functions of integer order : @xmath129 where @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 are the numerical coefficients to be determined by the boundary conditions .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath133 determines a transverse size of a dcc and therefore a spread of the @xmath6 distribution of the final pions .",

    "the magnitude of @xmath33 is much smaller than unity .",
    "the region of large values of @xmath138 corresponds to the forward and backward edges of dcc where energetic leading hadrons are moving outward while the small values of @xmath138 describe the cool central region . in this picture",
    ", it appears appropriate to choose @xmath135 such that the pion density is higher at a larger @xmath138 than at a smaller @xmath138 .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath33 to be real ( and positive ) in the following .",
    "it should be emphasized however that our choice for a real @xmath33 over purely imaginary or complex @xmath33 is more for the convenience of the presentation .    given @xmath123 and @xmath135 , @xmath139 obeys the differential equation @xmath140 the solution is given by @xmath141 and/or @xmath142 .",
    "the main difference between @xmath143 and @xmath144 is their different behavior as @xmath145 approaches @xmath146 . in the limit of a boost - invariance , @xmath147 , @xmath148 approaches unity while @xmath149 . if there is no transverse momentum , the latter approaches the uniform solution ( @xmath150 , @xmath151 ) described in sec .  2 , while the former coincides with the lowest energy solution given in ( 21 ) .",
    "putting all together , one obtains the uniform solution in a complete form : @xmath152 where one may superpose these solutions in @xmath33 , @xmath133 , and @xmath153 .",
    "it is much harder to solve directly for nonuniform solutions when there is no boost - invariance constraint . though some simple special solutions can be obtained by luck , finding all nonuniform solutions is a formidable task .",
    "in contrast , it is straightforward to perform @xmath11 rotations on the uniform solutions . the rotation formulas ( 23 ) and ( 24 )",
    "are most general and applicable to the boost - noninvariant case as well .",
    "therefore the nonuniform solutions can be obtained by the chiral rotation from the uniform one in ( 36 ) .",
    "an important question is whether we exhaust all nonuniform solutions by the axial rotations from the uniform solutions .",
    "in other words , are there any nonuniform solutions that can not be rotated into a uniform one ?",
    "if such a class of solutions exists , it would have some topological quantum number like a soliton .",
    "note however that the solutions of our interest are time - dependent , and that their energies and actions are not necessarily finite . unless these topologically nontrivial solutions exist , the uniform solution ( 36 ) and the @xmath11 rotations on it exhaust all solutions .",
    "it has been predicted that the pions decaying from a dcc will show a distinct charge distribution when the charge ratio is plotted event by event in @xmath154 . the distribution @xmath155 has been derived in two very different ways .",
    "the first derivation assumes that an isosinglet multipion state is created by the decay of a dcc @xcite .",
    "all pions decaying from a given dcc are assumed to occupy an identical orbital state that is determined by the spatial configuration of dcc .",
    "the bose statistics allows only one isosinglet @xmath156-pion state : @xmath157 where @xmath158 are the creation operators of the pions in the same single orbital state . making a binomial expansion of the right - hand side at large @xmath8 , one obtains a simple rule @xmath159 .",
    "it is later pointed out that the relative phase between @xmath160 and @xmath161 is inessential to the final prediction of @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "the second derivation is based on a more intuitive picture in classical field theory . assuming that the isospin orientation is uniform in space - time and that all isospin directions are equally probable , one obtains @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the solid angle for an isospin direction in isospin space . since the @xmath165 fraction @xmath12 is proportional to the square of the third component of the pion field , ( @xmath166 ) , one obtains again distribution ( [ dpdf ] ) . in this derivation",
    ", the interference effects are completely ignored .",
    "let us examine whether or not this prediction remains valid for the nonuniform dcc s .",
    "in the first derivation , it is crucial that only one orbital state is available for pions and therefore the isosinglet state is unique : for two pions , the isosinglet is nothing but @xmath167 by the clebsch - gordan coefficients . for four pions ,",
    "the group theory alone would allow two isosinglets .",
    "one is to combine the @xmath168 from @xmath169 with the other @xmath168 from @xmath170 .",
