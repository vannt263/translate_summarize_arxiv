    "according to kalkofen ( 2001 ) the problem of chromospheric heating is a question of energy supply for the radiative emission .",
    "it is thought that high frequency acoustic oscillations may provide this energy supply .",
    "the generation of acoustic oscillations can be described by the lighthill mechanism ( lighthill , 1951 ; proudman , 1952 ) .",
    "deubner ( 1983 ) argues that high frequency bursts are either generated by rising granules , or propagate more or less uniformly from deeper layers into the convection zone .",
    "the frequencies of acoustic oscillations depend on various fluid flow parameters @xcite .",
    "the most energetic oscillations should be generated in those regions where the convective velocities are largest @xcite .",
    "kalkofen ( 1990 ) suggests that the location of acoustic oscillations depend on their frequency . in areas of strong magnetic fields at the cell boundary",
    ", kalkofen calculates that heating is done by oscillations with frequencies of @xmath4mhz .",
    "the bright points are heated by oscillations with periods around @xmath5mhz ; while areas free of magnetic fields will be heated by oscillations of higher frequencies .",
    "observations @xcite show that acoustic events occur preferentially in dark intergranular lanes , i.e. corresponding to down flows of plasma and conclude that the excitation of solar oscillations is associated with rapid cooling occurring in the upper convection layer .",

    "domingues ( 2004 ) found that the magnetic flux in the quiet internetwork is smeared by insufficient resolution and therefore underestimated .",
    "he also found that there are areas in the quiet internetwork which have magnetic fields comparable to those from the pores .",

    "km for fe i @xmath0 nm . in nlte the corresponding heights are @xmath11 km and @xmath12 km for fe i @xmath1 nm and fe i @xmath0 nm respectively ( n. shchukina , private correspondence ) .    for the wavelet analysis used in this work we chose the morlet wavelet :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the non - dimensional frequency and @xmath15 the non - dimensional time parameter .",
    "the wavelet analysis code used is based on the work by torrence and compo ( 1998 ) .",
    "the associated fourier period , p , is @xmath16 for @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the wavelet scale ( see table 1 in torrence and compo ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "one - dimensional wavelet analysis is done for each spatial coordinate . at the beginning and end of the wavelet transforms",
    "there are regions where spurious power may arise as a result of the finite extent of the time series .",
    "these regions are referred to as the cone of influence ( coi ) , having a temporal extent equal to the @xmath19-folding time ( @xmath20 ) of the wavelet function . in our case",
    "it is @xmath21 .",
    "this time scale is the response of the wavelet function to noise spikes and is used in our detection criteria by requiring that reliable oscillations have a duration greater than @xmath20 outside the coi .",
    "this imposed a maximum period of @xmath22s ( or @xmath23mhz ) above which any detected periods were disregarded .",
    "the automated wavelet analysis carried out in this work has previously been presented in detail by bloomfield _",
    "( 2006 ) . in the current study",
    "only the power outside the coi is retained .    to determine whether registered oscillations are located above down - flows or up - flows , a comparison with velocity maps is performed .",
    "in this analysis the power has been normalized and only power in excess of @xmath24% of the normalised value is considered ( figure [ mapa ] . ) .",
    "mhz to @xmath2mhz , with power above @xmath24% of the maximum level .",
    "the remainder is set to a zero value.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    a comparison of the spatial distribution of high frequency oscillations with white - light structures was performed .",
    "high frequency oscillations power maps are compared pixel by pixel with the corresponding white - light image . in figure [ skater1 ] .",
    "a scatter plot for one frame in the time sequence is shown . the temporal difference between the white - light image and the power map",
    "is calculated according to the assumption that the high frequency oscillations travel with the speed of sound .",
    "this assumption is oversimplifying the true picture of the lower solar atmosphere and the oscillations within . up to the present , theoretical models of stellar atmospheres",
    "have been based on several simplifying assumptions , such as the restriction to a 1-dimensional ( 1d ) stratification in hydrostatic equilibrium with only a rudimentary parametrization of convection through .",
    "based on such models ( e.g. howleger and mller 1974 ) it is assumed that in the solar atmosphere the acoustic transit time is approximately 5 minutes ( for a height of @xmath25 km and a sound speed of @xmath26kms@xmath27 ) .",
    "for the propagation of acoustic waves in the solar atmosphere over several scale heights , their frequency has to be above the cut - off frequency equation ( [ cutoff ] ) .    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath30 the adiabatic coefficient , and @xmath31 with @xmath32 as density scale height , given as :    @xmath33    ( stix ( 2002 ) , chapter 5.2.4 ) .",
    "therefore in a 1d model the cut - off frequency varies only with atmospheric height .",
    "thus , at a certain height in the atmosphere a reflection layer exists where the values of @xmath29 and @xmath34 yield the appropriate cut - off frequency . for a given frequency ,",
    "a wave can be oscillating at one height and be evanescent at another .",
    "this situation can cause standing waves for almost the whole range of acoustic frequencies .",
    "fleck ( 1989 ) explain that there is a possibility for standing waves , originating from the total reflection of upward propagating waves at the chromosphere - corona transition region .",
    "this discovery of standing patterns was confirmed by espagnet _",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "virtually all information about the sun is deduced from its emergent spectrum .",
    "directly observable manifestations of solar convection ( granulation ) thereby influences the emergent spectrum .",
    "also most of our present empirical knowledge of solar surface magnetism stems from the analysis of the zeeman effect in spectral lines .",
    "routine magnetograms give the impression that cell interiors are non - magnetic , while some recent research showed that s not case ( domingues , 2004 ; andjic and wiehr , 2006 ; andic and voki , 2007 ; trujillo bueno _",
    "et al . _ , 2004 ) .    in light of this information ,",
    "the assumption that the observed oscillations are purely acoustic is oversimplifying and does not give the full picture of the processes .",
    "never the less , since current theories for the heating of the chromosphere favor acoustic oscillations , part of the current analysis is conducted with this assumption .",
    "for this part of the analysis the intergranular lanes ( darker areas ) were defined as areas where the intensity of the corresponding pixel is less than the modal intensity of the whole field of view .",

    "this coverage is calculated by summing the positions of all oscillations with power above @xmath24% of the maximum power over the complete time sequence .",
    "inspection of the table shows that oscillations observed in the @xmath0 nm line , which is formed higher in the atmosphere , cover more of the field of view than the @xmath1 nm line .",
    "this percentage is lower for ds3 .",
    "this is because no oscillations were registered over the pore .",
    "the observation used in this work were obtained in quiet solar regions , active regions with g - band structures and an active region containing a pore .",
    "our findings do not show a dependency on the selected solar locations .    in the data sets from the vtt , the higher formed spectral line @xmath0 nm show no preference in oscillation site location ( figures.[skater1 ] and [ procentaza ] and table [ tpodaci2 ] . ) , while for the lower formed line , @xmath1 nm , there is a slight preference towards down flow regions ( figures.[skatervtt ] and [ procentaza2 ] and table [ tpodaci2 ] ) .",
    "the influence of atmospheric seeing is mainly visible during speckle reconstruction .",
    "the work by von der lhe ( 1984 , 1993 , and 1994 ) estimates an error of @xmath47% in intensity introduced by speckle reconstruction .",
    "noise filtering was done following the recommendations of de boer ( 1996 ) , so that error levels remain at @xmath47% .",
    "seeing influences are most visible with differing data cadences . in the case of good seeing ,",
    "the cadence was lower than in the case of very good and excellent seeing conditions .",
    "therefore the amount of noise remaining after speckle reconstruction tended to vary only inside predicted error levels ( von der lhe , 1984 ; von der lhe , 1993 ; von der lhe,1994 ; de boer , 1996 ) . a full description of the errors is presented by andic ( 2007 )      observations ( espagnet _ et .",
    "al _ 1996 ) show that acoustic events occur preferentially in dark intergranular lanes .",
    "wunnenberg _ et . al _",
    "( 2002 ) claim that high frequency oscillations occur preferentially above down - flows .",
    "observations with the same spectral line as in the work of wunnenberg _ et . al _ ( 2002 ) shows no evidence for this preference .",
    "one of the main differences between the work of wunnenberg _ et .",
    "al _ ( 2002 ) and the present study has to do with the velocity response functions of the fe i @xmath0 nm line . in this work , velocity response functions were not used .",
    "kalkofen ( 1990 ) suggests that the location of acoustic oscillations should depend on their frequency .",
    "however , our findings do not agree with this prediction .",
    "the difference in the location of oscillations of various frequencies is too small to be taken as a serious indicator of their different positions .",
    "figure [ pozicije ] shows that differences in position with frequency do not exceed @xmath44% .",
    "also for this line those differences are mainly positive indicating that upward velocities are dominant . only in the frequency range @xmath48mhz to @xmath49mhz",
    "are there indications for dominance towards donward velocities . nevertheless ,",
    "since the difference is less than @xmath6% this can not be considered as a significant result .    also , all observed oscillations tend to follow similar patterns , which contradict the statement by espagnet _ et . al _ ( 1996 ) that most energetic oscillations are associated with down - flows in dark areas which are well separated from each other in time and space .",
    "considering the fact that espagnet _ et .",
    "al _ ( 1996 ) were working with oscillations of much lower frequencies , this could explain the difference .    the formation height of this spectral line places the core of the line in the vicinity of the temperature minimum .",
    "this opens consideration that some of the granulation motions could be registered as oscillations in this work .",
    "espagnet _ et .",
    "al _ ( 1995 ) show that intensity fluctuations associated with granules disappear in a very short distance , below @xmath50 km above the continuum level . yet , velocity fluctuations associated with granulation cross the whole thickness of the photosphere .",
    "this is typical for larger granules ( @xmath51 ) above which velocities spread throughout the whole photosphere .",
    "therefore it is possible that some of the oscillations detected here from the velocity maps could be originating from granulation . to remove such velocities , without imposing the limit on the registered frequency range ,",
    "those oscillations with height depended amplitude decay are eliminated .",
    "the maximum velocities from averaged granules on this height were noted to be below @xmath6 km/h , while the maximum observed velocities in this work were around @xmath5 km/h , therefore all velocity oscillations with amplitudes below @xmath24% were not analysed in this work . this method does not exclude velocities associated to very large granules where the decay is slower .",
    "the slight preference for oscillatory appearance above downwards velocities is found in observations with the this line .",
    "comparing to the intensity of the continuum image shows substantial preference toward darker areas in the granulation pattern .",
    "figures [ skatervtt ] and [ procentaza2 ] show that oscillations registered in this line do show preference in their location .",
    "figure [ pozicije ] shows that difference in position with frequency does not exceed @xmath44% . for this line",
    "those differences are mainly negative indicating that downward velocities are dominant .",
    "but since the difference is less than @xmath6% , this also can not be taken as a significant result .    the formation height of this spectral line places the core of the line in the middle of the photosphere",
    "this makes the results even more sensitive to granulation overshooting .",
    "again , the main concern are velocities which on this level can be , on average , around @xmath6 km/h",
    ". since maximum velocities noted for this height are also around @xmath5 km/h , the method mentioned above can not successfully remove all velocities which could be associated with granulation .",
    "therefore the error in the results for this line is larger , but no more than @xmath52% .        during the work itself , i had lots of stimulating discussions for which i wish to thank r. cameron , a. vgler and e. wiehr .",
    "i wish to thank p. sutterlin and k. janssen for giving me the software for the data reduction . for the help with the observations",
    "i wish to thank j. hirzberger and k. puschmann .",
