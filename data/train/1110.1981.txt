    "when studying global properties of smooth , singular maps , a typical approach is to first solve problems locally , and then glue the local solutions together . when the map @xmath9 in question is stable , the typical local situation is the following : singularities of @xmath9 are found along stratified subsets of source and target of @xmath9 .",
    "each stratum consists of points where a certain singular germ @xmath3 appears as a singularity of @xmath9 .",
    "these strata are submanifolds of source and target , respectively , and in tubular neighborhoods of these submanifolds , @xmath9 restricts to a fibered family of germs @xmath3 , as illustrated in fig .  [ tubedmap ] .",
    "such decompositions are discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the singular germs are determined up to changes of local coordinates in source and target of the germ , also called a _",

    "two germs @xmath10 are right - left - equivalent , and hence define the same singularity , if there exist diffeomorphism germs @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that @xmath13 .",
    "the group @xmath1 of all such equivalences @xmath14 coincides with the product of groups @xmath15 , where @xmath16 consists of source diffeomorphism germs @xmath17 and @xmath18 consists of target diffeomorphism germs @xmath19 .",
    "these groups all act on the space of multigerms @xmath20 through composition of maps , e.g. , @xmath21 .     and @xmath22 of the source manifold @xmath23 , we find singularities @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which are both mapped onto the submanifold @xmath26 of the target manifold @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath9 is stable , then in tubular neighborhoods @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath9 will restrict to a fibered map @xmath30 , where @xmath31 . in order to combine constructions on such local decompositions back into a global construction ,",

    "[ tubedmap ] defines a fiber bundle , whose structure group is the stabilizer @xmath2 of @xmath1-equivalences leaving @xmath3 invariant . in order to patch local constructions on such local fiber bundles together , it becomes essential to understand @xmath2 . in reality",
    ", the germ @xmath3 will often be a multigerm , where each point in the target of the map corresponds to several source points , just like in fig .",
    "[ tubedmap ] .",
    "thus , we need to understand @xmath2 in the case where @xmath3 has several source basepoints . for instance , knowledge of the structure of @xmath2 for multigerms @xmath3 is used in @xcite to prove topological stability of maps .    in this article , we show that given a finitely @xmath1-determined multigerm @xmath3 , the group @xmath2 has a maximal compact subgroup , which is unique up to conjugacy .",
    "we denote an arbitrary representative of the conjugacy class by @xmath4 , and we show that the quotient @xmath5 is contractible , where contractibility is defined through a smooth map extension property .",
    "geometrically , this means that we can reduce the non - topological structure group @xmath2 of the tubular neighborhood bundle to the compact , finite - dimensional lie group given by @xmath4 .",

    "the step from monogerms to multigerms is trivial .",
    "it is easy to see that we can decompose the groups @xmath33 and @xmath34 , defined on p.  , for multigerms @xmath35 to a product of @xmath33-groups for monogerms : @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "[ unionk ] similarly , for the group of source diffeomorphisms , or @xmath16-_equivalences _ , we have @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "what is easy to show is that the axes @xmath60 are left invariant under @xmath61 , since this is where the singularities @xmath43 are found , but this is not enough .",
    "we had hoped that it might be easier to find a decomposition for compact subgroups @xmath62 , as these are conjugate to linear subgroups of @xmath1 .",
    "however , we meet yet another problem  can we find coordinates that _ simultaneously _ give @xmath3 in the form ( [ multigermdecomp ] ) _ and _ linearize @xmath63 ?",
    "this problem might be solved by replacing @xmath63 by the @xmath64-jet of @xmath63 , which is isomorphic to @xmath63  but @xmath65 would not generally leave @xmath3 invariant , and hence would not be a subgroup of @xmath2 .",

    "the set @xmath610 is a reductive complex algebraic subgroup of the algebraic group @xmath611 , and if we write @xmath612 and @xmath613 for the lie algebras of @xmath63 and @xmath610 , respectively , then @xmath614 .",
