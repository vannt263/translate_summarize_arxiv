    "disorder in materials induces the frustration effect and makes it difficult for cooperative phenomena to occur@xcite .",
    "for example , in random magnets , conventional magnetic orders such as ferromagnetic ( fm ) and nel orders are suppressed by the frustration that arises from disorder .",
    "consequently , the ordering temperature of random systems is lower than that of pure systems and the ordered phase disappears due to random interactions between magnetic moments in some cases .",

    "this model can be considered as a fundamental model of isotropic materials .",
    "however , we can not adapt this model in the present case because origins of interaction depend on the direction in the infinite - layer structure treated in this paper . in this case , the emergence of disorder of interaction should depend on the direction . in isotropic random systems ,",
    "the key element is the concentration density of each ion . in anisotropic random systems , in addition to that , the spatial distribution of disorder is also important",
    ". then it is an interesting issue to investigate phase transition and spin structure in anisotropic random systems . since recent developments in synthetic methodology enable us to design the spatial structure of materials , the above - mentioned issue has become increasingly important in materials science .",

    "thus , we performed neutron diffraction measurements at low temperature .",

    "figure  [ fig : intensity ] shows the neutron diffraction pattern for sr(fe@xmath6mn@xmath7)o@xmath2 at 10 k. as expected from the previous report@xcite , the diffraction profile has magnetic peaks such as ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) and ( 1/2,3/2,1/2 ) characterized by a wave vector ( @xmath13 ) , together with a nuclear reflection with a tetragonal @xmath27 cell ( @xmath28 = 4.001  , @xmath29 = 3.441  ) .",

    "[ fig : intensity_temp ] . here , it is seen that the two peaks lose their intensities gradual with increasing temperature , and at and above 240 k , both peaks disappear and the intensities decrease to the background level .",
    "the pure srfeo@xmath2 system exhibits ( @xmath13 ) order only , and thus the appearance of the ( @xmath200 ) peak is caused by the effect of substitution on mn ions .",
    "we can not predict the sign of direct exchange interaction along the interlayer direction , because the direct exchange interaction strongly depends on the environment around it .",
    "in contrast to the interlayer interaction , from the goodenough - kanamori rule@xcite , fe - o - mn and mn - o - mn superexchange intralayer interactions must be antiferromagnetic .",
    "thus , the simultaneous appearance of @xmath4 and @xmath5 wave vectors indicates that interlayer fm interactions appear at mn sites .",
    "a simple explanation of the observed simultaneous ( @xmath13 ) and ( @xmath200 ) wave vectors is phase separation into the ( @xmath13)-type spin structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cg_configuration ] ( a ) ) and the ( @xmath200)-type spin structure ( fig .  [ fig : cg_configuration ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the other scenario is the emergence of a bulk spin structure in which ( @xmath13 ) and ( @xmath25 ) wave vectors coexist .",
    "since sr(fe@xmath0mn@xmath1)o@xmath2 is an anisotropic random system that has never been investigated theoretically , it is possible this type of bulk spin structure emerged in sr(fe@xmath0mn@xmath1)o@xmath2 . indeed , as we will see in the following theoretical argument , we find a novel type of magnetic structure that can explain the simultaneous appearance of ( @xmath13 ) and ( @xmath200 ) wave vectors . from these considerations , in sec .",

    "to investigate whether there is a bulk spin structure that explains the simultaneous appearance of ( @xmath13 ) and ( @xmath25 ) wave vectors without any phase separation , we construct a simplified effective model of sr(fe@xmath0mn@xmath1)o@xmath2 . we introduce a classical heisenberg model with site - random interlayer couplings on the cubic lattice .",
    "this model includes the characteristic features of sr(fe@xmath0mn@xmath1)o@xmath2 : ( i ) the system consists of two types of magnetic ions randomly placed on the lattice and ( ii ) competition between fm and af interactions exists along only the interlayer direction .",

    "a and b ions correspond to fe and mn ions in sr(fe@xmath0mn@xmath1)o@xmath2 .",
    "the first term of the hamiltonian denotes the uniform af nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath36 in the @xmath37-plane .",
    "the sign of the nearest - neighbor interaction in the second term depends on the arrangement of a and b ions along the interlayer direction ( @xmath29-axis ) : the interactions between a ions are assumed to be af where @xmath38 , and other interactions are assumed to be fm where @xmath39 .",
    "we assume that absolute values of the interactions are the same ( @xmath40 ) for simplicity .",
    "the interactions of this model are summarized in table  [ tab : interaction ] . under this rule of interactions , we assume that the interlayer interaction at b ion sites is always fm",

    "in the case of @xmath48 , the af interaction is dominant ( @xmath49 ) along the interlayer direction .",
    "in contrast , the fm interaction is dominant ( @xmath50 ) for @xmath51 .    in the site - random model , the signs of interactions along the interlayer direction",
    "are correlated , and thus the fm correlation between next - nearest layers ( nnls ) emerges .",
    "in fact , the effective fm interaction between nnls exists regardless of @xmath19 in our model .",
    "the sign of the effective interaction between next - nearest - neighbor sites is defined by @xmath52 where @xmath32 and @xmath53 denote next - nearest - neighbor sites along the interlayer direction through the site @xmath54 . to show that effective interactions are always fm , we investigate the arrangements of three ions including two interactions along the interlayer direction .",
    "if the signs of both interactions are the same , that is , @xmath55 , the effective interaction is fm ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "in contrast , if one of the interactions is fm coupling and the other is af coupling , that is , @xmath57 , the effective interaction is af ( @xmath58 ) . for example , the effective interactions of arrangements a - a - a and a - a - b are fm and af , respectively .",
    "we summarize the effective interactions and probabilities depending on arrangement of three ions in table  [ tab : nnn_interaction ] . from table  [",
    "tab : nnn_interaction ] , the probabilities of fm and af effective interactions are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively . the spatial average of signs of effective interactions between nnls , @xmath61 , is given by @xmath62 from this equation , it is clear that @xmath61 is negative regardless of @xmath19 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "thus , the effective interaction between nnls is always fm . from this fact",

    "moreover , we have constructed the phase diagram of temperature versus b ion concentration . in the phase diagram , the successive phase transitions have been observed .",
    "we have also found the critical exponents of each phase transition .    in sec .",
    "v , to clarify the emergence mechanism of the mixed phase , we have investigated the effects of random interlayer couplings by using mean - field calculations .",
    "it is important for the existence of a mixed phase that spins be more susceptible to transverse field than longitudinal field . since the transverse component of the random field from neighboring layers becomes large in the mixed phase , the magnetization vectors of neighboring layers are not parallel or antiparallel .    in sec .",
    "vi , we have discussed whether the random fan - out state is robust with respect to the details of the model .",

    "furthermore , in our model , the spin - fan structure exists in the ground state without an external field . in frustrated magnetic systems ,",
    "the well - known spin - fan structure is realized by applying an external field along the direction parallel with the spiral plane@xcite .",
