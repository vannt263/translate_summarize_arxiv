    "<S> inspired by the notion that environmental noise is in principle observable , whilst fundamental noise due to spontaneous localisation would not be , we study the estimation of the diffusion parameter induced by wave function collapse models under continuous monitoring of the environment . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account finite measurement efficiencies and , in order to quantify the advantage granted by monitoring , we analyse the quantum fisher information associated with such a diffusion parameter , identify optimal measurements in limiting cases , and assess the performance of such measurements in more realistic conditions .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction . _ - spontaneous localization models @xcite , in their many flavours and variations , were introduced from the late eighties primarily as an attempt to unify the dynamics of microscopic and macroscopic systems , encompassing measurement apparata , which customary quantum mechanics only describes through ad hoc prescriptions that can not be relied to the fundamental dynamical principles . </S>",
    "<S> while such models reproduce quantum and classical mechanics in the extreme regimes of few ( @xmath0 ) and very many ( @xmath1 ) elementary constituents , they do deviate substantially from standard quantum mechanics in the intermediate mesoscopic regime . as molecular interferometry @xcite and quantum opto - mechanics , especially in the levitating paradigm @xcite , are swiftly advancing into this mesoscopic middle ground , there is currently a lively interest in designing and carrying out experiments that would falsify either standard quantum mechanics or its spontaneously localized variants @xcite .    in a nutshell , </S>",
    "<S> spontaneous localization models postulate the presence of an additional stochastic term in the schrdinger equation , that would be responsible for the wave - function collapse and the perceived discontinuous dynamics of quantum projective measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this would essentially imply the existence of a source of `` fundamental '' decoherence , in the form of momentum dissipation , acting on a mesoscopic system , such as a levitating opto - mechanical nanosphere . </S>",
    "<S> it has hence been recently noted that , if the sources of `` environmental '' decoherence  due to the interaction and entanglement with the environment  are well known , the additional fundamental decoherence could be directly observed by tracking the system s dynamics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the detection of fundamental effects over the background of environmental ones is however obviously difficult , as the two may take the same form and imply qualitatively similar effects . </S>",
    "<S> the primary intent of this work is emphasising that a possible distinction between fundamental and environmental decoherence is that , while the former is unavoidable and beyond repair , the latter can in principle be reversed through measurements : if the physical degrees of freedom of the environment are completely or partially accessible , one can perform measurements on them that partly restore information about the quantum state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> drawing from this notion , we will hence consider the estimation of the free parameter of qmupl ( `` quantum mechanics with universal position localization '' ) or of an equivalent function of the two parameters of the csl ( `` continuous spontaneous localization '' ) wavefunction collapse model , under time - continuous measurements on the environment of a quantum degree of freedom , such as the centre of mass of a levitated nanosphere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter will be our system of reference , bearing in mind that similar results would apply to more general settings . </S>",
    "<S> the monitoring we consider , aided by markovian linear feedback , has the added bonus of stabilising the dynamics @xcite , so that we will be in a position to base our investigation entirely on steady state properties and not on the features of the transient dynamics , which may be more elusive to record in practice .    as a further element of novelty </S>",
    "<S> , we will not just consider specific empirical signatures of the different values of the collapse parameter but instead address their systematic , ultimate discrimination by applying quantum estimation techniques and deriving the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) associated with such a parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we will quantify exactly the advantage provided by continuous monitoring as a decrease in the achievable uncertainty on the parameter estimation , and hence on the discrimination between different theories . </S>",
    "<S> we shall derive analytical expressions for both the qfi and the optimal final measurement for parameter discrimination in limiting instances , and show the latter performs remarkably well in realistic situations too .    _ </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics . _ - to fix ideas , we shall consider a single noisy continuous variable quantum degree of freedom subject to a positive definite harmonic hamiltonian and to momentum diffusion , as would be the case for a trapped nanosphere undergoing heating via photon scattering , background gas collisions and blackbody radiation @xcite . in order to simplify our treatment , we shall not include the typically smaller effects of position diffusion and friction @xcite , which could be accounted for promptly within our formalism but would not add much conceptual insight . </S>",
    "<S> the additional stochastic term acting on the state vector according to the qmupl model is equivalent to a momentum diffusion lindblad superoperator entering the master equation for the quantum state @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the same is approximately true for the centre of mass of motion of mesoscopic objects in the csl model , since the position fluctuations are expected to be much smaller than the model localization length and one can perform a first order expansion of the superoperator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the overall dynamics we shall consider is the following : @xmath3 + \\gamma \\ : \\mathcal{d}[\\hat{x}]\\varrho \\ ; , \\label{eq : me}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4=i$ ] ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 and @xmath7\\varrho = o\\varrho o^\\dag - ( o^\\dag o \\varrho + \\varrho o^\\dag o)/2 $ ] . the momentum diffusion rate is the sum of two contributions : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is due to environmental effect , while @xmath10 is fundamental . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is analysing the estimation of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that such a parameter is equivalent to the only fundamental parameter of qmupl and constrains the parameters of the csl models through the formula @xmath11 @xcite , where @xmath12 is the mass of the object , @xmath13 is a factor that depends on its geometry , and the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 characterise the model ( the value for the intrinsic length scale is typically chosen at @xmath16 nm , while bounds on the collapse rate are currently placed at @xmath17 @xcite ) . since we will consider only one mode , we will assume that after having trapped the nanosphere and cooled its motion down by sideband cooling , one will either turn off or detune the driving field in order to decouple the nanosphere motion and the cavity field . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we will focus on the evolution of the mechanical oscillator alone .    </S>",
    "<S> as already argued , in principle one can always counter the environmental decoherence by monitoring the environment . here , we suppose to monitor the nanosphere position through the scattered light , obtaining a conditional dynamics described by the following conditional master equation @xcite : @xmath18 \\varrho \\ : { \\rm d}w \\ : , \\label{eq : sme}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 denotes the monitoring efficiency , @xmath20\\varrho = o \\varrho + \\varrho o^\\dag - \\tr[\\varrho ( o + o^\\dag)]$ ] and @xmath21 represents a standard wiener increment . as the hamiltonian @xmath22 is quadratic in the position and momentum operators , the evolution described by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sme ] ) sends gaussian states into gaussian states , and thus we can fully describe it by looking at the evolution of the covariance matrix @xmath23 and the first moments vector @xmath24 of the quantum state @xmath2 , defined in components as @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] for the operator vector @xmath27 . remarkably , due to a very specific property of quantum and classical conditional gaussian statistics , one obtains @xcite that , while the evolution of the first moments is , as expected , stochastic , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ depends on the results of the measurement performed on the environment , the covariance matrix evolves deterministically . in formulae : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a vector of independent wiener increments . </S>",
    "<S> the matrices @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are given in the supplemental material @xcite as functions of the dynamical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the efficiency parameter @xmath33 $ ] will allow us to describe realistic situations where the environmental degrees of freedom are only partially accessible ( as would be the case for the imperfect collection of light scattered by a nanosphere ) . </S>",
    "<S> note also that setting @xmath34 obviously yields the original , unmonitored dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the deterministic evolution of the second moments , one can prove that real - time linear feedback ( _ i.e. _ real - time displacement in phase space depending on the measurement current ) can be applied in order to obtain a steady state with zero first moments and thus remove the stochasticity of the evolution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may not be the optimal strategy in terms of the estimation of @xmath10 , but we will nonetheless consider this regime in what follows and set the first moments to zero , as it does allow for a deterministic steady state and will let us illustrate the advantage granted by the monitoring with a very compact , entirely analytical treatment . </S>",
    "<S> also , in an experiment , a stable steady state is certainly much more desirable than a stochastically fluctuating one , on which one would have to perform an optimal discriminating measurement that would also fluctuate stochastically . </S>",
    "<S> now , if all the other dynamical parameters are known , the steady state solutions of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : evolutioncm ] ) yield a family of gaussian states with zero first moments parametrized by the different values of @xmath10 . to assess the effectiveness of our strategy , in the following we will derive the ultimate limits on the estimation of @xmath10 , quantified by the quantum and classical cramr - rao bound evaluated on such a family of states .    _ quantum estimation theory . _ </S>",
    "<S> - let us consider a family of quantum states @xmath35 parametrized by a parameter @xmath36 that we want to estimate . </S>",
    "<S> if one performs a measurement described by a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) @xmath37 , the ultimate limit on the precision of any unbiased estimator for the parameter @xmath36 is set by the cramr - rao bound @xcite @xmath38\\ : , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the number of measurements performed , @xmath40 is the so - called ( classical ) fisher information ( fi ) , and @xmath41 $ ] denotes the conditional probability describing the whole measurement process .    by optimizing over all the possible povms , </S>",
    "<S> one derives the quantum cramr - rao bound ( qcrb ) @xcite @xmath38 \\geq 1/[m h(\\gamma ) ] \\ : , \\label{eq : qcrb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 $ ] is the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) and @xmath43 is the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) that is implicitly defined by the equation @xmath44 . as apparent from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : qcrb ] ) , the qfi quantifies with how much precision one can estimate the parameter @xmath36 independently from the specific measurement performed . </S>",
    "<S> geometrically , the qfi corresponds to the bures metric in the hilbert space @xcite : large values of the qfi correspond to large bures distances between two quantum states @xmath35 and @xmath45 obtained via an infinitesimal variation of the parameter @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> we also remark that for single - parameter estimation it is guaranteed that an optimal povm saturating the quantum cramr - rao bound always exists @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ fundamental diffusion estimation . _ - as detailed above , we want to assess the estimation of the parameter @xmath10 , whose information is encoded in the gaussian steady state obtained through the monitoring described by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sme ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we will focus only on the steady state covariance matrix solution @xmath46 of the riccati equation ( [ eq : evolutioncm ] ) , as we can assume that the first moments will be equal to zero . </S>",
    "<S> it should be remarked here that the linear driving needed to set the first moments to zero does depend on the parameter @xmath10 we need to estimate . and so will the final optimal quantum measurement to be performed on the steady state . </S>",
    "<S> however we can invoke , as customary in _ local _ quantum estimation problems , a multi - step adaptive protocol in order to solve this possible conundrum : one can apply the optimal protocol valid for an initial rough guess of the parameter @xmath10 ( say , in our case , @xmath47 ) , estimate the parameter through the measurement just performed , and then refine the operation and optimal measurement to be implemented given the latest estimate of the parameter . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in several cases that , after a few adaptive steps , one obtains an estimator giving the true value of the parameter and saturating the cramr - rao bound @xcite .     as a function of the monitoring efficiency @xmath19 , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and and for different values of the estimated fundamental diffusion @xmath10 . from top to bottom : @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> [ f : qfi ] right : ratio between the classical fi for the povm introduced in the main text ( optimal for perfect monitoring and no collapses ) , and the qfi @xmath51 as a function of the monitoring efficiency @xmath19 and of the ratio between fundamental decoherence @xmath10 and environmental decoherence @xmath9 ( the environmental decoherence is kept fixed to @xmath49 ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ f : optimalpovm],title=\"fig : \" ]    under these assumptions ( gaussian steady state with zero first moments ) , the qfi can be evaluated analytically from the covariance matrix @xmath46 , as described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the general analytical formulae for the steady state covariance matrix @xmath46 and the qfi @xmath51 are rather cumbersome and are reported in the supplemental material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we start our analysis by discussing the general properties of the qfi by looking at fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f : qfi ] . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , it is apparent from the graph that the qfi increases monotonically with the detection efficiency @xmath19 , providing one with a quantitative confirmation that countering the environmental decoherence through continuous measurements would help in the estimation of the collapse - induced diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> also , the qfi decreases monotonically with @xmath10 , implying that , in principle , smaller values of the parameter can be estimated more efficiently in terms of absolute error . </S>",
    "<S> next , it is instructive to consider the limiting case of perfect monitoring efficiency ( @xmath52 ) , where the qfi takes the compact analytical form @xmath53 one can easily check that in the limit of both perfect monitoring and zero fundamental decoherence ( @xmath47 ) , the qfi diverges . </S>",
    "<S> this can be intuitively understood by looking at how the steady state @xmath54 changes in the hilbert space by varying the parameter of interest : as we have already remarked , for perfect monitoring and zero fundamental decoherence , the steady state is pure ; however , increasing the value of @xmath10 from zero introduces a diffusion that can not be neutralized by monitoring the environment and , therefore , a mixed steady state ( the same reasoning applies to the case of fixed @xmath47 and measurement efficiency @xmath19 decreasing from the maximum value ) . </S>",
    "<S> the abrupt change from pure to mixed states is responsible for the diverging qfi , and also yields insight as to the identification of the optimal quantum measurement saturating the qcrb . in point of fact , this argument singles out a dichotomic measurement corresponding to projecting either on the steady state itself @xmath55 or on the rest of the hilbert space , in order to be sensitive to the change from a pure to a mixed state . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding povm , described by the operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 , is indeed optimal , as it can be shown to achieve the quantum cramr - rao bound . </S>",
    "<S> this povm can be realized by first applying the symplectic operation that sends the vacuum state into the pure steady state @xmath55 ( this operation involves some squeezing @xcite , that could be obtained by modulating the trap potential @xcite ) , and then by performing a vacuum projection ( which , in optomechanics , could in principle be achieved by a mapping of the mechanical state onto the light mode through red sideband driving , followed by a measurement of the latter with an avalanche photodiode , that distinguishes between zero and any positive number of photons ) .    </S>",
    "<S> more revealing than the quantum fisher information itself is the associated signal to noise ratio @xmath58  quite simply , the ratio between the estimated value and its standard deviation  which can be easily determined from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eta1 ] ) in the case of perfect monitoring , and reads @xmath59 which , in the regime @xmath60 , goes like @xmath61 ( let us remind the reader that @xmath39 is the number of estimation runs ) , and hence vanishes as @xmath10 vanishes .    </S>",
    "<S> the limits of perfect continuous monitoring of the environment and zero fundamental decoherence are clearly idealizations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the continuity of the qfi assures us that very high precision can be obtained in their neighbourhood , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ for high but not perfect efficiency @xmath62 and for the interesting case of small csl decoherence , when @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> we have in fact also investigated the performance of the povm just described also for different values of @xmath19 and @xmath10 , where we know it is no longer optimal . </S>",
    "<S> as apparent from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f : optimalpovm ] , the ratio between the classical fi and the qfi is still above @xmath64 for a reasonably large region of values of @xmath19 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly relevant since the optimal measurement , as is often the case , depends on the parameter to be estimated ; given these results , one can indeed apply the optimal measurement for the case of zero fundamental decoherence , and still achieve a very high precision in the most interesting region of small , but not zero , values of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the most convincing evidence for the advantage granted by the continuous monitoring comes from considering the number of measurements needed to achieve a signal to noise ratio of one in the plausible scenario of continuous spontaneous localization with @xmath65 , for a hypothetical nanosphere of radius @xmath66 , mechanical frequency @xmath67 khz and subject environmental diffusion @xmath68 as a function of the monitoring efficiency @xmath19 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : snr ] . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the number of runs goes from around one million for the unmonitored case to around @xmath69 for perfect monitoring . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one concludes that environmental monitoring would help in designing experiments able to improve the existing bounds on @xmath10 .    as a further piece of analysis , one can consider the dependence of the signal to noise ratio @xmath70 on the mechanical frequency @xmath71 in the csl model , where @xmath71 and the oscillator mass @xmath12 determine @xmath10 . for perfect efficiency </S>",
    "<S> , this reads @xmath72 with @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a decreasing function of @xmath74 , confirming that oscillators at lower frequencies ( which , however , are more challenging to cool down to the quantum regime ) would prove advantageous in this context , as already indicated in proposals such as @xcite , where an ion trap , rather than optical tweezers , was considered .     and for @xmath65 ( other parameters are set considering a nanosphere of radius @xmath66 , with mechanical frequency @xmath67 khz and with environmental diffusion @xmath68 kzhz ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ f : snr ] right : ratio between the qfi @xmath75 obtained for the state at time @xmath76 and the steady state qfi @xmath51 as a function of the evolution time @xmath76 , for @xmath77 khz , @xmath68 khz and @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> [ f : finitetime],title=\"fig : \" ]   and for @xmath65 ( other parameters are set considering a nanosphere of radius @xmath66 , with mechanical frequency @xmath67 khz and with environmental diffusion @xmath68 kzhz ) . [ </S>",
    "<S> f : snr ] right : ratio between the qfi @xmath75 obtained for the state at time @xmath76 and the steady state qfi @xmath51 as a function of the evolution time @xmath76 , for @xmath77 khz , @xmath68 khz and @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> [ f : finitetime],title=\"fig : \" ]    _ finite time analysis . _ - all the results reported above have been derived considering the mechanical oscillator steady state . in order to validate such an analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the transient dynamics of the qfi and in particular its ratio with the qfi obtained at steady state . </S>",
    "<S> the results are plotted for experimentally reasonable values of the parameters in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : finitetime ] . </S>",
    "<S> we focus in particular on small values of the fundamental decoherence parameter @xmath10 , but we have numerical evidence that similar results are obtained for larger values . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from the graph , the ratio goes indeed to one in a relatively small time ( around @xmath79 with our parameters ) , _ i.e. _ the precision on the estimation of the parameter @xmath10 can be safely obtained at finite time . while in the case of perfect monitoring ( @xmath80 ) , the ratio increases monotonically to @xmath81 , in the case of @xmath82 one observes a maximum , indicating the possibility of a better estimation at finite times . </S>",
    "<S> however , this marginal advantage would come at the price of having to perform fast measurements at a certain fixed time : as argued above , in a laboratory it may be more expedient to wait for the stable steady state .    _ discussion and outlook . </S>",
    "<S> _ - it should be noted that our estimation analysis assumed perfect knowledge of all the dynamical parameters other than our target @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this may be particularly delicate , especially in regard to the environmental diffusion @xmath9 , which would have to be inferred from other parameters through theoretical considerations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantum estimation theory could however be adapated to allow for uncertainties in dynamical parameters other than the estimated one ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the optomechanical paradigm </S>",
    "<S> , one could also take into account the coupled light field : the extension of the present study to the full , two - mode optomechanical system , and the identification of associated optimal global detection strategies , will be an interesting development of this line of inquiry .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , as it stands , our study clearly highlights the substantial advantage that monitoring environmental decoherence , whenever and to whatever extent possible , would grant . </S>",
    "<S> this notion , we argue , should hence inform the design of experiments aimed at setting bounds on wave function collapse models . here </S>",
    "<S> monitoring would be , in a sense , an active way of `` putting aside the impediments of matter '' that hinder the detection of fundamental effects , much in the same fashion as friction was standing in the way of galileo s analysis of free fall motion @xcite . </S>",
