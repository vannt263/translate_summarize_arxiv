    "since 80s of the 20th century the condensed matter realization of the @xmath1 - dimensional dirac fermions @xcite attracts attention of researchers .",
    "the discovery of graphene in 2004 @xcite was a tremendous breakthrough in the experimental realization of the massless dirac fermions .",
    "now a family of the solid - state dirac materials which includes both the brothers of graphene , viz . made in 2010 silicene , announced in 2014 germanene @xcite , and cousins such as mos@xmath2 , topological insulators , weyl semimetals , etc .",
    "there are even artificially designed in 2012 nephews such as molecular graphene @xcite and ultracold fermionic atoms in optical honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "an exciting feature of the latter artificial condensed matter system is that it allows one the experimental realization @xcite of the haldane model @xcite where the time - reversal symmetry is broken and a quantum hall effect appears as an intrinsic property of the band structure in the _ absence _ of an external magnetic field .    as a matter of fact",
    ", the low - energy description of these systems is based on a pair of the independent effective dirac hamiltonians @xmath3 where the pauli matrices @xmath4 act in the sublattice ( pseudospin ) space , the two - dimensional wave - vector @xmath5 is counted off the two independent @xmath6 points ( with @xmath7 ) in the brillouin zone , and @xmath8 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath9 is the mass ( gap ) term .",
    "although the spin degree of freedom is neglected for simplicity , it can be easily included if necessary .",
    "accordingly , the most general expression for the gap is given by @xmath10 where the gap @xmath11 is invariant with respect to the time - reversal symmetry , and @xmath12 is not .    in the simplest case @xcite , @xmath13 , the mass term @xmath11 originates from a different on - site energy on two triangular sublattices that form hexagonal lattice .",
    "the fermion doubling @xcite guarantees that the ordinary solid - state dirac materials are always described by pairs of the hamiltonians ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , so that the full hamiltonian @xmath14 respects time - reversal symmetry ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview of the discrete symmetries for the various mass terms ) , @xmath15 that involves operator @xmath16 swapping @xmath17 and @xmath18 valleys . here",
    "@xmath19 is the unit matrix .",
    "the inversion symmetry is , however , broken because the sublattices are inequivalent for @xmath20 .",
    "obviously , when a separate @xmath21 point is considered , the time - reversal symmetry is always broken .",
    "a more sophisticated case , @xmath22 , with broken time - reversal symmetry is realized in the haldane model @xcite by including next - nearest - neighbour ( nearest - neighbour on the same sublattice ) hopping and periodic local magnetic flux density with zero total flux through the unit cell .",
    "the experimental implementation of this model in @xcite is highly nontrivial",
    ". an earlier history of searches of the condensed matter realization of the time - reversal anomaly is presented in @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the specifics of the haldane model appears to be more transparent when one considers the spectrum of the hamiltonians ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in an external magnetic field @xmath23 applied perpendicular to the plane along the positive @xmath24 axis .",
    "accordingly , the momentum operator @xmath25 has to be replaced by the covariant momentum @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 is the electron charge and @xmath28 is the vector potential in the landau gauge .",
    "the corresponding landau level energies are @xmath29 where @xmath30 .    in @xmath31 dimensions",
    "there are two inequivalent irreducible @xmath32 representations of the dirac algebra labelled by @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) corresponds to the representation @xmath34 with @xmath35 . in general",
    ", one can relate the sign of the energy of the @xmath36 landau level to the sign of the product of the mass , @xmath9 , and the signature , @xmath37 , of the dirac matrices @xmath38 .",
    "the signature is defined as @xcite @xmath39 = \\pm 1\\ ] ] and is called sometimes `` chirality '' .",
    "thus , instead of putting the @xmath40 sign in the matrix @xmath41 , one can instead include this sign in the mass term ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    as mentioned before , in the time - reversal symmetric case , @xmath42 , the spectrum of the full hamiltonian @xmath43 is particle - hole symmetric and invariant under @xmath44 .",
    "the case @xmath45 and @xmath46 corresponds to the so called haldane mass that breaks time - reversal symmetry . as the result , the @xmath36 `` zero - mode '' level breaks both the particle - hole symmetry and invariance under @xmath44 .",
    "it is crucial that the difference between these cases survives even in the @xmath47 limit , making possible the quantum hall effect in the absence of magnetic field .    the vast majority of the literature ( see e.g. refs .  @xcite and references therein ) on the thermodynamic properties of the dirac fermions including magnetic oscillations",
    "is devoted to the case of the particle - hole symmetric spectrum .",
    "this concerns both the papers that consider the reducible @xmath48 representation of the dirac algebra in @xmath31 dimensions and present a field theoretical perspective of the problem @xcite and the works devoted to the condensed matter systems @xcite with even number of fermion species .",
    "since the time - reversal symmetry is preserved , a finite hall conductivity is only possible in nonzero external magnetic field . respectively , the first magnetic field dependent term of the grand thermodynamic potential @xmath49 is proportional to @xmath50 , so that there is no net magnetization in the limit @xmath51 .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to study the thermodynamic properties of the dirac fermions with the broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "in other words , we focus on the asymmetric spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) associated with the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) for one fixed value of @xmath52 , viz .",
    "we take @xmath13 , and have @xmath53 . having the thermodynamic potential for `` unphysical '' case with a fixed @xmath52 , it is straightforward to obtain , for example , the result for two @xmath54 points with the haldane mass and include the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we already began by presenting in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] the problem and the model hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : grand - omega ] we consider the grand thermodynamic potential .",
    "we show that the unboundedness of the landau level spectrum for the negative energies results in the diverging carrier density and discuss the relativistic form of the thermodynamic potential that corresponds to the finite carrier imbalance . the magnetic field dependent parts of the carrier imbalance and density are obtained in sec .  [ sec : density ] using the euler - maclaurin formula .",
    "the main results of the present paper that include thermodynamic potential and magnetization in the low magnetic field regime are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : magnetization ] . using the steda formula we overview in sec .",
    "[ sec : hall ] how the obtained expressions can be linked to the known results for the hall conductivity in the anomalous and normal cases . in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , the main results of the paper are summarized .",
    "the grand thermodynamic potential @xcite can be written as follows @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the temperature , @xmath57 is the chemical potential , and @xmath58 is the density of states ( dos ) . we have also set the boltzmann constant @xmath59 .",
    "the derivative of the thermodynamic potential ( [ omega.nonrel-def ] ) with respect to the chemical potential @xmath57 , @xmath60 determines the density of carriers @xmath61 in nonrelativistic many - body theory as a function of @xmath56 , @xmath62 , and @xmath57 . here",

    "we observe that eq .",
    "( [ number - nonrel-1 ] ) diverges because the spectrum ( [ spectrum ] ) is unbound for the negative energies @xmath65 .",
    "since the dirac hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) has to be regarded as an effective model hamiltonian derived from the tight - binding model , the divergence can be removed by using the appropriate band - width cutoff .    the other way to remove",
    "this divergency is to begin with so called relativistic thermodynamic potential ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath73 to clarify the physical meaning of the potential ( [ omega.rel-def ] ) we differentiate it with respect to @xmath57 and obtain the relativistic carrier density @xmath74 then for the particle - hole symmetric spectrum , i.e. when the dos @xmath58 is an even function of the energy @xmath75 , @xmath76 one can see that @xmath77 .",
    "further , using the identity @xmath78 with @xmath79 being a step function , one can rewrite the last equation in the following form @xmath80 \\theta(- \\epsilon ) \\right].\\ ] ] this shows that @xmath81 corresponds to the relativistic carrier density or the carrier imbalance , viz .",
    "@xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the densities of `` electrons '' and `` holes '' , respectively . accordingly",
    ", when the dos is the even function of energy , the relativistic thermodynamic potential ( [ omega.rel-def ] ) can be presented as a sum of the vacuum , electron and hole terms @xcite illustrating its physical meaning .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath85 for the case of the asymmetric dos is discussed in detail in @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .    substituting the dos , @xmath67 given by eq .",

    "one can see that , in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ number - nonrel-1 ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ number - rel1 ] ) converges .",
    "thus the use of the relativistic potential ( [ omega.rel-def ] ) makes the calculation free of divergencies , but at the end one should prove that the physical results do not change as compared to the results that follow directly from the initial potential ( [ omega.nonrel-def ] ) .    in general , one can relate the grand thermodynamic potential ( [ omega.nonrel-def ] ) and the relativistic potential ( [ omega.rel-def ] ) as follows @xmath89 when the @xmath58 is an even function of the energy @xmath75 , the last term with the integral in eq .",
    "( [ omega - linked ] ) reduces to @xmath90 then the carrier imbalance @xmath81 and total carrier density @xmath61 are related by the expression @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the density of particles for a half - filled band ( in the lower dirac cone ) .",
    "note that both @xmath93 and @xmath92 are divergent , so that the appropriate cutoff has to be introduced .",
    "this reflects the already mentioned fact that in the continuum field theory there is no lower bound to the dirac sea of filled electron states .",
    "the thermodynamic potential ( [ omega.rel-def ] ) can be restored from the particle density @xmath94 by integration @xmath95 here @xmath96 is a constant of integration .",
    "similarly , integrating @xmath97 one restores the potential ( [ omega.nonrel-def ] ) .",
    "the magnetization @xmath98 in the direction perpendicular to the plane is defined in the grand canonical ensemble by the derivative with respect to @xmath62 at fixed chemical potential , i.e. @xmath99 thus one needs only the magnetic field dependent part of the grand thermodynamic potentials ( [ omega.rel-def ] ) and ( [ omega.nonrel-def ] ) .",
    "a special interest for us represents a linear in magnetic field part of the thermodynamic potential those presence would imply a nonzero net magnetization in the limit of @xmath51 .",
    "since we are interested in the weak field regime , there is no need to evaluate the sum over landau levels exactly .",
    "the simplest way to extract the magnetic field dependent terms is to use the euler - maclaurin formula @xmath100 following the seminal paper on landau diamagnetism @xcite .",
    "firstly we calculate the carrier imbalance @xmath88 from eq .",
    "( [ number - rel1 ] ) , so that @xmath101 with @xmath102 repeating the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite one can see that the use of the euler - maclaurin formula is justified in the weak - field regime , @xmath103 with @xmath104 being the landau scale .",
    "one can see that the term with the integral in eq .",
    "( [ e - m ] ) is independent of the magnetic field similarly to the original landau consideration @xcite .",
