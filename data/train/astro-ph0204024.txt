    "modern theories of star formation predict the evolution of the density structure , @xmath10 , and velocity structure , @xmath11 , of the gas and dust envelope of protostars .",
    "optically thin dust emission at submillimeter wavelengths provides an observational constraint on the density distribution of the protostellar envelope and therefore constrains theoretical models of star formation .",
    "class 0 protostars represent an early , highly embedded phase during the formation of low mass stars ( @xmath12 few @xmath13 ) .",
    "the original evolutionary sequence for low mass protostars ( class i , ii , and iii ) is based on the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from observations at near and mid - infrared wavelengths ( lada 1987 ) .",
    "low mass protostars are thought to evolve from a thick dusty envelope where most of the energy is re - radiated by dust in the far - infrared ( class i ) to progressively less embedded objects with near and mid - infrared excesses from dusty disks ( class ii or classical t tauri stars and class iii or weak - line t tauri stars ) .",
    "the discovery of extremely embedded objects with submillimeter telescopes led to a new class of protostars , class 0 objects , which are so highly enshrouded that their near infrared emission has generally not been detected and their seds peak longward of 100 .",
    "observationally , class 0 sources are cores that have @xmath14 , where  is the total luminosity detected longward of 350  ( andr et al . 1993 ) .",
    "alternatively , class 0 sources are characterized by @xmath15k , where  is the temperature of a blackbody with the same mean frequency as the observed sed ( chen et al .",
    "based on the relative numbers of class 0 and class i objects , it has been argued that the timescale for class 0 objects is short , perhaps @xmath16 years ( andr et al .",
    "class 0 objects have powerful outflows , which suggest high accretion rates ( bontemps et al . 1996 ) .",
    "as data improve , some class i sources are being reclassified to class 0 sources ( e.g. , shirley et al . 2000 , young et al .",
    "2001 ) , suggesting a reexamination of this argument ( see also visser , richer , & chandler 2001 ) .    it is important to understand the structure of the envelope of class 0 objects since they are likely to be the earliest observed phase of star formation with a central accreting protostar ( andr et al .",
    "the emission from an optically thin dust shell observed at an impact parameter , @xmath17 , with dust opacity , @xmath18 , that does not vary with radius , is given by @xmath19 ( adams 1991 ) , where @xmath20 is the outer radius .",
    "for an optically thin envelope ( at all wavelengths ) dominated by a central source of luminosity , @xmath21 , the dust temperature distribution can be approximated by a power law : @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( cf . doty & leung 1994 ) and @xmath24 is the power law exponent of the dust opacity ( @xmath25 ) , which typically lies between 1 and 2 in the submillimeter .",
    "if we also assume the density distribution follows a power law , @xmath0 , then in the rayleigh - jeans limit ( @xmath26 ) , the specific intensity integral simplifies to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "previous studies of the density structure of class 0 objects assumed a temperature power law of the form @xmath29 ( walker et al .",

    "2000 , and motte & andr 2001 ) . however , this approach is @xmath30 valid in the outer envelopes of low luminosity sources due to a breakdown in the rayleigh - jeans approximation at wavelengths shorter than 1 mm and due to external heating from the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) ( shirley et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it then becomes necessary to calculate  self consistently in the integral in equation ( 1 ) to reveal the density distribution of the envelope .    in paper i ( shirley et al .",
    "2000 ) , 21 low mass cores within 325 pc were observed at 850  and 450 using the submillimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ) ( holland et al . 1999 ) on the jcmt 15-m radio telescope .",
    "thirteen sources from the original sample were classified as class 0 , three sources having been previously classified as class i. in this paper , we present 1d dust radiative transfer models for seven of the class 0 sources selected for spatial isolation and high signal - to - noise radial profiles ( @xmath31 ) : b335 , b228 , l723 , iras03282 + 3035 , l1448c , l1527 , and l483 .",
    "b335 , b228 , iras03282 + 3035 , and l1448c appear circular in the dust continuum maps down to the 20% contour , while l1527 , l483 , and l723 are clearly aspherical at that level .",
    "the bolometric temperature ranges from 23k ( iras03282 + 3035 ) to 52k ( l483 ) and the bolometric luminosity ranges from 1.2  ( iras03282 + 3035 and b228 ) to 13  ( l483 ) . in paper ii",
    "( evans et al . 2001 ) , three pre - protostellar cores ( l1512 , l1544 , and l1689b ) were modeled using one - dimensional radiative transfer and a beam convolution code . in this paper , the seven class 0 sources will be modeled using the same procedure used in paper ii , with the addition of an internal luminosity source .",
    "the modeling procedure and inputs are discussed in section 2 .",
    "we use b335 as a test object ( section 3.1 ) to model the sensitivity to the model input parameters .",
    "individual sources are modeled in sections 3 and 4 , while the implications of our best fit models are discussed in section 5 .",
    "the 1d dust models are calculated from a modified version of the egan , leung , and spagna ( 1984 ) continuum radiative transfer code .",
    "this code iteratively calculates the equilibrium dust temperature on a 1d radial grid by simultaneously solving the combined moment radiative transport equations in quasi - diffusion form and the energy balance equations as a two - point boundary value problem .",
    "the radiation field is constructed by solving a set of ray equations along impact parameters , @xmath17 , through the cloud .",
    "there are four physical inputs to the radiative transfer code : the density distribution , @xmath32 ; the internal source luminosity , @xmath21 ; the scaling factor for the interstellar radiation field , @xmath33 ; and the dust opacity , @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , the radial grid ( 100 points ) and impact parameters , as well as the wavelength grid ( 59 wavelengths ) are chosen to cover the relevant range so that results are insensitive to the details of these grids . the equilibrium dust temperature distribution , , which is the output from the dust code ,",
    "is used by an observation simulation code ( paper ii ) to calculate the normalized radial intensity profiles , , by solving equation ( 1 ) , performing beam convolutions , and simulating chopping .",
    "the code also models the observed sed , , by convolving the model intensity with the beam ( ) used in each observation .",
    "the internal radiation field is assumed to be a blackbody with an effective temperature of 6000 k. since all of the objects we are modeling are very opaque at near - infrared wavelengths , the exact shape of the spectrum of the internal radiation field is not important ; only the total internal luminosity is important .",
    "the shape of the isrf was determined from cobe results ( black 1994 ) plus the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the ultraviolet  component of the isrf ( @xmath35 ) from van dishoeck ( 1988 ) .",
    "this isrf is considerably stronger in the infrared than the previous versions of the isrf ( mathis , mezger , & panagia 1983 ) ( see figure 2 of paper ii for a plot of the different isrfs ) .",
    "we modify the strength of the isrf by multiplying all portions of the isrf spectrum except the cmb with a factor denoted by .",
    "for the models discussed in this paper , we used a coarse grid with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "these factors for the far - uv ( fuv ) portion of the isrf correspond to 0.45 , 1.5 , and 4.5  respectively , where  is integrated fuv flux between @xmath39 nm and @xmath40 nm in units of @xmath41 erg s@xmath42 @xmath43 ( cf .",
    "hollenbach et al .",
    "1991 ) . in paper ii , the best fit to the observed radial profiles and",
    "sed suggest a lower strength to the isrf ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the dust opacity , @xmath34 , was taken from the models of ossenkopf and henning ( 1994 ) for grains that have coagulated for 5 yr at a density of 6 , both with ( oh5 ) and without ( oh2 ) accreted ice mantles .",
    "we assume a gas to dust ratio of 100 by mass to convert oh5 opacities ( per gram of dust ) to opacity per gram of gas .",
    "oh5 opacities have been successful at reproducing the sed of both high mass ( van der tak et al .",
    "2000 ) and low mass star forming cores ( paper ii ) . oh5 opacities at submillimeter wavelengths can be approximated by a power law ( @xmath45 ) with @xmath46 and an opacity of @xmath47 @xmath48 per gram of gas at 850 .",
    "the oh2 dust opacities are lower at far - infrared  wavelengths but up to 1.6 times higher at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths than oh5 dust opacities .",
    "the cross - over point is near 350   ( see fig . 2 of paper ii ) .",
    "the jcmt beams derived from afgl618 and uranus were used for the beam convolution of the model profiles at 850 and 450  ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "it is very important to convolve the model specific intensity distribution with a realistic beam profile to derive an accurate estimate of the envelope density distribution . using a gaussian beam shape instead of the actual beam profile",
    "can profoundly distort the interpretation of the power law index , @xmath4 , by up to 0.5 ( shirley et al . 2000 ) . since the beam shape was stable during the second half of the night in april 1998",
    "( see paper i ) , nine uranus profiles were added together to use an average beam profile with high signal - to - noise out to 70   from the center of the map .",
    "no planets were available to make beam maps for the january 1998 sources ( l1527 , iras03282 , l1448c ) ; so the secondary calibrator , afgl618 was observed .",
    "the january 1998 observations were taken in the first half of the night when the beam shape is not so stable and changes shape continuously as the telescope cools .",
    "afgl618 is much weaker than uranus at 850 and 450 ; therefore the beam maps have much lower signal - to - noise at large radii .",
    "the january beam map was produced by averaging together three afgl618 maps observed during the same time of night that our objects were observed . because the 450  profile of afgl618 becomes too noisy beyond 34 ,",
    "the average uranus beam profile from april was used for the 450  january beam beyond 34 .",
    "these beam calibration difficulties introduce larger uncertainties , @xmath49 , in the best fit models for the january sources .",
    "many of the radial profiles from paper i show a turn - down in the intensity profile beyond 60  from the center of the map .",
    "this turn - down could be due to a steepening of the density profile or due to the effects of chopping . to test the possibility of a steeper density profile ,",
    "we must account for the chop throw .",
    "the scuba observations were chopped in azimuth with a 120  chop throw .",
    "since the scuba array is 2d , all of the positions within a single annulus chop different distances from the center of the map .",
    "therefore , our 1d model can only include an approximate simulation of the true effects of chopping .",
    "the details of how we simulate chopping has a noticeable effect on the shape of the model intensity profiles beyond 60 ; consequently , we do not attempt to model normalized intensity profiles beyond this radius .",
    "the agreement between the model and the data can be quantified in terms of the reduced chi - squared for the normalized intensity profile at wavelength @xmath50 : @xmath51 ^ 2 / \\ ; n_{b } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the azimuthally averaged , normalized intensity in a circular aperture at impact parameter @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the uncertainty in the data , and @xmath55 is the number of impact parameters .",
    "only points spaced by a full beam are used in computing @xmath56 to avoid introducing correlations .",
    "we calculate @xmath56 for the 850 and 450  profiles and define  as the sum of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the signal - to - noise was higher for the 850  maps and therefore the @xmath57 has the most weight in determining the best fit .",
    "the agreement between the model sed and the observed one is quantified by @xmath59 , calculated from a similar equation : @xmath60 ^ 2 / \\ ; n_{\\nu } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the observed flux into a beam and @xmath62 is the modeled flux into the same beam . when photometry at the same wavelength with different beams exists , the points are both considered in calculating @xmath63 .",
    "wavelengths shorter than 60  are not included because they are expected to be optically thick and therefore very sensitive to asymmetric geometries ( e.g. , outflow cavities , flattened envelopes ) , which we are currently unable to model .",
    "in addition , much of the far - infrared photometry has large and uncertain calibration errorbars , and the opacities as a function of frequency are uncertain .",
    "for all these reasons , poor fits to the sed are not considered a serious problem in constraining the density distribution ; however we often find that the best , which considers only the profiles , occurs for the model with the best @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , the sed and the normalized radial intensity profiles provide nearly orthogonal constraints on model parameters (  3 ) .",
    "the sed is sensitive to the strength of the isrf and a mass@xmath65opacity product ( paper ii ) .",
    "in particular , the flux density at 850 constrains the mass , while the full sed provides information on the the variation of dust opacity with frequency , subject to the caveats mentioned above .",
    "measurements of the flux density into different beams at the same wavelength provides some constraint on the density distribution , but the _ shape _ of the density distribution is much better constrained by the normalized radial profile ( ) .",
    "the simplest models to test are single power laws , @xmath66\\ ] ] in  for the gas density .",
    "the density , @xmath67 , is normalized to a fiducial radius , @xmath68 , of 1000 au and represents the total gas number density ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) .",
    "there are seven parameters in the power law models : the power law exponent , @xmath4 ; the density at a fiducial radius , @xmath67 ; the inner radius , @xmath71 ; the outer radius , @xmath20 ; the internal source luminosity , @xmath21 ; the dust opacity , @xmath72 and the strength of the interstellar radiation field , @xmath73 . in these models , the shape of the density profile , defined by @xmath4 is constrained by , and only slightly affected by other parameters .",
    "in contrast , @xmath67 and hence the mass , are constrained by the observed flux density at optically thin wavelengths ; we use @xmath74 because the calibration errors are lowest .",
    "the resulting mass depends inversely on the opacity at 850  ( @xmath75 ) and weakly on other parameters .",
    "we also test models of inside out collapse ( shu 1977 ) , hereafter referred to as shu77 models .",
    "these are characterized by seven parameters : @xmath76 , the effective sound speed ; the radius that encloses the infalling gas , ; @xmath71 ; @xmath20 ; @xmath21 ; @xmath72 ; and .",
    "inside , the density distribution tends toward @xmath77 , while @xmath78 outside .",
    "the shape of the density profile is thus set by , while the normalization is set by .",
    "we fix  based on observations of optically thin spectral lines ; thus shu77 models have no freedom in the normalization of the density profile , unlike power law models .",
    "the constraints on the other parameters are similar for the two types of density profiles .",
    "the internal source luminosity ( ) is constrained by the integral of the sed and secondarily by .",
    "the internal luminosity dominates the bolometric luminosity over heating from the isrf for sources with @xmath79 .",
    "the model internal luminosity is tuned until the model bolometric luminosity ( @xmath80 ) matches the observed bolometric luminosity ( @xmath81 , paper i ) , using the same method to integrate over the sed .",
    "the model bolometric luminosity is calculated using the same wavelengths and beams as the observed bolometric luminosity . @xmath81 and",
    "@xmath80 may be greater than @xmath21 for low luminosity sources because the isrf adds energy .",
    "in some cases , especially for more luminous sources  underestimates  because the beams used at some wavelengths do not capture all the emission ( see butner et al .",
    "1990 for a full discussion ) .",
    "the choice of the overall opacity law ( ( @xmath82 ) ) is constrained by the _ shape _ of the sed once other parameters , like @xmath4 , , and  are constrained .",
    "models of b335 are used to test our assumptions of nearly orthogonal constraints and the effects of changing various parameters in the model (  3 ) .",
    "b335 ( iras 19345 + 0727 , l663 ) is an extensively studied class 0 object within the barnard 335 dark cloud .",
    "its submillimeter emission is very nearly circularly symmetric ( huard et al . 1999 , paper i , motte et al .",
    "the core is the one of the best cases for a collapse candidate as deduced from models of observed asymmetric line profiles in cs and h@xmath83co  ( zhou et al .",
    "1993 , choi et al .",
    "rotation , if any , is very slow ( frerking et al .",
    "1987 , zhou , 1995 ) , making simple spherical models reasonable .",
    "b335 has an outflow that lies nearly in the plane of the sky along an east - west direction ( goldsmith et al .",
    "there is little direct evidence in the submillimeter continuum maps of extensions or flattening along or perpendicular to the outflow direction , making this core a suitable choice for 1d modeling .",
    "harvey et al . (",
    "2001 ) have recently studied b335 using a near - infrared extinction mapping technique to probe the density structure ( cf .",
    "alves , lada , & lada 2001 ) .",
    "these observations provide an important check on the consistency of our submillimeter continuum models .",
    "we shall model the density structure of the outer envelope of b335 using both a single power law and the inside - out collapse model of shu ( 1977 ) .",
    "a @xmath84 power law is a good starting model because it has the same density distribution as a singular isothermal sphere , until it is truncated at an inner radius .",
    "the outer radius was chosen to allow proper simulation of chopping at the distance of b335 ( 250 pc ; tomita et al .",
    "the chop throw for our observations was 120 , corresponding to 30,000 au at the distance of b335 .",
    "both the radial profile and the observed beam profile contain useful information 60  from the center of the map ; therefore , to allow the beam to chop onto the model density distribution for radial points 60  from the center , the modelled density distribution must extend to twice the chop throw ( 240 ) or 60,000 au at the distance of b335 .",
    "nicmos observations of b335 indicate that reddening of background stars blend into the background noise beyond 125  ( harvey et al .",
    "2001 ) , which is within the range of the outer radii tested in our models .",
    "we initially chose the inner radius such that @xmath85 so that @xmath86au for b335 .",
    "for the initial test model , we used oh5 opacities . the fiducial density , @xmath67 , was varied to match the observed flux at 850 microns ; @xmath87 , and the internal luminosity , @xmath21 , was varied until the model matched @xmath88 ( paper i ) .",
    "the resulting best fit was @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this basic model was used to test the effects of varying @xmath20 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath4 , , and distance .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath4 and @xmath21 to changes in the other parameters is summarized in table 2 .",
    "changes in @xmath20 result in changes in the total envelope mass proportional to @xmath91 for a power law ; however , the column density along a line of sight , and hence the emission at long wavelengths into a fixed beam becomes insensitive to @xmath20 for @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "for the test model , the density is @xmath94  at 60,000 au .",
    "this low value is probably not realistic as the dense core is embedded in an extended cloud ( frerking et al .",
    "even if a constant density of @xmath95  is used for the lower limit to the density in the envelope , doubling the outer radius to 120,000 au only increases a@xmath96 by slightly less than 1 magnitude of visual extinction .",
    "this lower limit is used for all subsequent models . allowing the density to fall below @xmath95  results in no significant change in the best fit fiducial density or internal luminosity .",
    "factor of two changes in  have negligible effect on the best fit parameters .",
    "if  is made small enough ( @xmath97 au ) , the fit degrades ( table 1 ) , but this @xmath20 is smaller than the extent of observed emission in the scuba map .",
    "while the column density increases as @xmath71 decreases , beam dilution is more important .",
    "the scuba beams are much larger than the inner radii in our models ( the 450  beamwidth of 8  corresponds to a radius of 520 au for our nearest source , b228 ) ; therefore changes in the inner radius will not have substantial effects unless the inner radius gets too large .",
    "factor of two changes in  have negligible effects ; a factor of 4 increase in  begins to degrade the fit to the 60  point on the sed ( figure 2 ) .",
    "however , 60  observations can be affected by deviations from spherical geometry , so the 60  flux should not be considered a strong constraint on one dimensional models .",
    "we do not model the effects of a disk ( see section 5.5 ) .",
    "the result of these tests is that the best - fit model parameters are not sensitive to changes of factors of 2 in  or .",
    "larger changes worsen the fit , indicating that there is no evidence in our data for either inner or outer boundaries in the power laws .",
    "calculations of dust opacities differ substantially between dust models , especially at long wavelengths ; for example oh5 and oh2 dust models have opacities at @xmath98  that are 6 and 12 times those of the model for dust in the diffuse interstellar medium ( draine & lee 1984 ) . with no further information",
    ", these differences would result in substantial uncertainties in @xmath67 , or equivalently the mass since @xmath99 .",
    "however , the sed is strongly affected by the choice of opacity law and can be used to distinguish dust models ( e.g. , butner et al .",
    "1991 , van der tak et al . 2000 ) if the density distribution is independently constrained . if oh2 opacities are used instead of oh5 opacities , the best fit power law remains @xmath100 with @xmath67 about one - third that of the test model .",
    "the higher ( 850 ) of oh2 dust requires less column density to match the flux at 850 .",
    "none of the power law fits using oh2 dust produce enough emission to match the sed at @xmath101  @xmath102  ( figure 2 ) , yielding quite large values of @xmath103 . changing the submillimeter opacity by a factor of a few",
    "does not strongly affect the _ shape _ of the model density profiles , confirming our conclusions about the orthogonality of the radial profile and the sed .",
    "a dust opacity that varies with radius could in principle affect the fit to the shape of the density profile ; however , we see no evidence for variation of opacity with radius ( see  5.3 ) .",
    "other models of star formation predict density distributions different from the singular isothermal sphere ( e.g. mclaughlin & pudritz 1997 , ciolek & basu 2000 ) . without explaining the details of these models we note that the differences often can be approximated by variations in the power law index ( @xmath4 ) in the bulk of the envelope .",
    "we therefore considered models with @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "both the @xmath104 and @xmath107 models fit very poorly ( fig .",
    "the @xmath107 model shows that the predicted radial profile becomes very sensitive to the beam shape for steep power laws .",
    "variations in @xmath4 of 0.1 produce noticeable changes in the intensity profiles . in summary , we find that the @xmath100 initial test model is the best fit profile for oh5 dust and @xmath108 , and that variations in @xmath4 of 0.1 can be distinguished if all other parameters are fixed .",
    "heating by the isrf affects the temperature distribution in the outer envelope .",
    "the temperature levels off and eventually rises again towards the outer boundary of the cloud .",
    "the location of the minimum in the temperature is dependent on the isrf strength and  ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the strength of the isrf could affect the intensity profiles and the sed .",
    "we tested these effects on the best fit power law by multiplying the ultraviolet  to far - infrared  portion of the isrf by factors of @xmath109 and @xmath36 . with @xmath110 ,",
    "the best fit is obtained with @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "obviously , the greater contribution to the flux from the isrf explains why a lower internal luminosity is appropriate .",
    "even though @xmath113 and @xmath103 are not significantly different from the standard model , the predicted sed is too bright at fir wavelengths and severely underestimates the 60  flux . using @xmath36 ,",
    "the best fit is obtained with @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( figure 4 & 5 ) .",
    "this model clearly yields the best fit to the intensity profiles of all of the power law models that we have considered , but the model sed has too much flux at shorter wavelengths ( i.e. , 60 )",
    ". a lower strength of the isrf is consistent with the best fit models in paper ii .",
    "a study of [ cii ] and [ oi ] emission lines with iso towards b335 is consistent with a slightly higher strength of the isrf , @xmath116 ",
    "@xmath117   ( nisini et al .",
    "clearly , there is uncertainty in the strength of the isrf around b335 .",
    "we conclude that uncertainties of a factor of 10 in cause changes in @xmath4 by @xmath118 , but that the sed provides some constraints that can decrease this uncertainty .",
    "the effect of the uncertainty in distance was checked on the initial test power law by assuming b335 was at half the published distance ( 125 pc ; cf .",
    "harvey et al .",
    "since the core is now closer , smaller inner and outer radii ( 30 pc and 30,000 pc ) were used .",
    "the best fit power law index and shape of the model profile are very insensitive to the uncertainty in the distance (  increases by less than @xmath119 ) .",

    "the effect of changing the observed beam shape was tested by substituting the january 1998 beamshape into the best fit power law model for b335 .",
    "the difference in beamshape between january and april 1998 beams was greater than the difference between individual beam profiles observed during april 1998 .",
    "the best fit power law was slightly lower , @xmath122 , indicating that uncertainties in the beam shape may effect the interpretation of the best fit model by as much as @xmath49 .",

    ". however , the  is not as good for this model as for the test model .",
    "a somewhat different opacity law would fit better .",
    "the fit to the radial profiles is not perfect , with some systematic deviations as a function of impact parameter that suggest deviations from a simple power law , but given uncertainties in the beam shape , we consider this fit to be adequate .    in summary ,",

    "a factor of @xmath116 decrease in @xmath205 from the oh5 value would bring the dust model mass and virial mass into agreement on average .",
    "the spectral index , @xmath206 , was calculated from the model fluxes at 450 and 850  in a 120  aperture ( l1448c excluded due to confusion ) using @xmath207 the model spectral index calculated within a 120aperture agrees extremely well with the observed spectral index from paper i ; @xmath208 . the model spectral indices are within the observed error bars ; however , the total uncertainty on the 450  flux ( @xmath209 ) makes the observed spectral index fairly uncertain .",
    "oh5 opacities are also successful in reproducing the observed submillimeter spectral indices for class 0 sources .",
    "we also considered possible changes in the spectral index as a function of impact parameter . to avoid calibration uncertainties we compare",
    "the _ normalized _ specific intensity , @xmath210 , for the best fit models to the observed ratios ( figure 13 ) .",
    "the variations in the model ratio match those in the observed ratio .",
    "apparent variations in the spectral index can be removed by taking into account beam effects and a realistic temperature distribution .",
    "for example , the first sidelobe at 450  results in a large increase in the ratio .",
    "the lower signal - to - noise in outer annuli would mask any subtle variations in the dust opacity .",
    "l483 is a clear exception as the model specific intensity ratio does not decrease as fast as the observed ratio .",
    "the 450  model is too flat at large radii .",
    "however , this discrepancy may be caused by our use of a spherical model on an aspherical source rather than an actual variation in the dust properties .",
    "there is thus little evidence for variations of the dust opacity with radius .",
    "this result contrasts with some earlier work ( e.g. , visser et al . 1998 , johnstone & bally 1999 ) in regions forming more massive stars , but agrees with the conclusions of chandler & richer ( 2000 ) , who were studying regions similar to those in this study .",
    "it is extremely important to use a realistic beam profile and for modeling both the 850 and 450  scuba maps .",
    "the contribution from the isrf can be important to the heating of the region of the outer envelope probed by scuba observations of low luminosity cores . scaling the ultraviolet  to far - infrared  portion of",
    "the isrf by a factor of 3 in either direction resulted in changes of the best fit power by factors of @xmath5 .",
    "every source profile except l1448c was better fitted by a lower strength of the isrf , @xmath36 , in agreement with models of pre - protostellar cores ( paper ii ) .",
    "modest shielding of the isrf by surrounding gas in the molecular cloud surrounding the dense core could account for this .",
    "l1448c is forming in a much more crowded region and may be subjected to a stronger isrf .",
    "our models provide an estimate of the internal luminosity of the central protostar . for all of our sources , the internal luminosity accounts for nearly all of the observed luminosity ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "while the heating from the isrf is important for the temperature structure of the outer envelope , it does not contribute significantly to the overall observed luminosity of the class 0 sources we modeled .",
    "there is a wide range of internal luminosities modeled , from @xmath37  to @xmath168 , with an average internal luminosity of @xmath212 . for each of the best fit models ,",
    "the flux at 850  and the observed bolometric luminosity were fitted simultaneously . for sources with seds",
    "not observed shortward of 60 , the model internal luminosity is a lower limit .",
    "all of the luminosities were calculated using the distances from paper i. since the distance to many globules are uncertain to 50% , a true determination of the internal luminosity is uncertain to 100% ; however , the model and observed internal luminosities are consistent for the distance adopted .",
    "interestingly , the most luminous source , l483 , has about the same envelope mass as the others .",
    "the greater luminosity should reflect either a higher stellar mass or a higher accretion rate .",
    "if the former , it would imply a higher starting mass for the condensation ; if the latter , it might be reflected in the linewidths .",
    "in fact , the linewidth of the n@xmath83h@xmath137  line is similar to that of the other sources .",
    "alternatively , the accretion might be in a transient high state , similar to an fu orionis event .",
    "while our models take into account heating from a central source , heating from the isrf , realistic beam effects , and simulated chopping , they can not effectively model asymmetries seen in the dust continuum maps , flattening due to rotation or effects of magnetic fields , and clearing of material in outflow cavities .",
    "five of the cores modeled ( b335 , b228 , l723 , iras03282 + 3035 , l1448c ) appear sufficiently symmetric that the most important effect not included would be lower densities in outflow cavities .",
    "harvey et al . ( 2001 ) found a strong asymmetry in the ( h  k ) colors along the outflow directions in b335 , indicative of clearing of material along the outflow axes .",
    "the resulting best fit models included an outflow opening angle of 35  to 45 .",
    "while no such asymmetry is observed in the submillimeter continuum maps of b335 ( paper i ) , extensions along the outflow directions ( e.g. , l1527 , l723 ) and perpendicular to the outflow direction ( e.g. , l483 ) are observed in submillimeter maps of class 0 sources .",
    "the overall impact outflows have on the density structure of the envelope will become clearer with finer resolution and higher sensitivity .",
    "future multi - dimensional modeling of the dust continuum emission should attempt to account for the effects of the outflow .",
    "we have neglected the emission from a disk .",
    "chandler & richer ( 2002 ) showed that the flux from a disk is negligible compared to the the total flux from the envelope of class 0 sources ; however , class 0 sources may have a substantial fraction of emission from a compact component within the central beam .",
    "the interpretation of the density structure of the outer envelope may be strongly affected when a centrally normalized radial profile is used . only a few class",
    "0 sources have been observed at submillimeter wavelengths with interferometers ( cf .",
    "brown et al . 2000 ) resulting in few constraints on submillimeter disk fluxes .",
    "observations of 2.7 mm continuum towards l1527 with ovro and bima find a flux of @xmath213 mjy from a compact component ( terebey et al .",
    "1994 , shirley et al . unpublished observation ) . using a model for an active disk ( @xmath214 ; butner et al .",
    "1994 ) , we find an upper limit of @xmath215 jy at 850 . in this scenario , the disk accounts for up to @xmath6 of the flux within the central beam , decreasing @xmath4 by @xmath216 .",
    "it is likely that the 7  aperture included flux from the envelope , thereby overestimating the flux from a disk .",
    "if the disk has a steeper temperature power law ( @xmath217 ) , then the flux contribution drops to @xmath218 jy at 850  and the change in the best fit power law model is @xmath219 . as another example , the choi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) shu77 model fits the b335 radial profile when the disk flux equals the envelope flux within the central beam ( @xmath220 jy at 850 ) . however , bima millimeter observations of b335 do not support such a high disk flux ( shirley et al .",
    ", unpublished observation ) .",
    "constraints on the disk flux and modeling of bima observations of the dust continuum towards class 0 protostars will be presented in a future paper .",
    "we have modeled seven class 0 sources using single power law and shu77 density distributions .",
    "power law models suitably fit the 850   profiles and sed of all class 0 sources .",
    "five sources with circular contours are best fitted by a steep value of the power law index @xmath173 ( b335 , b228 , l723 , iras03282 + 3035 , l1448c ) , while two sources with aspherical emission are fitted by flatter power law indices @xmath221 ( l1527 , l483 ) .",
    "uncertainties in the strength of the isrf , , and beam shape limit the accuracy in the power law index to @xmath118 .    the shu77 model from choi et al . ( 1995 ) does not fit the b335 radial profiles .",
    "smaller infall radii are able to fit the profiles ( b335 , b228 , l723 , iras03282 + 3035 , l1448c ) , but the infall radius is within the central 450   beam , effectively making the density distribution appear like a single power law throughout the region of the envelope probed by scuba .",
    "the average mass within a 120  aperture is @xmath138  and is reasonably consistent with virial mass estimates and observed mass estimates from paper i and models of the initial conditions from paper i. we find little evidence for variations in the dust opacity with radius .",
    "oh5 dust reproduces the observed spectral index on average and provides a good fit to many seds .",
    "in addition , it leads to masses determined from dust emission that are consistent with virial masses to a factor of 2 .",
    "heating from the isrf is very important for correctly interpreting the temperature profile of the outer envelope of low mass star forming cores but does not significantly contribute to the total bolometric luminosity .",
    "the dust models constrain the internal luminosity of class 0 protostars , but distances to isolated cores remain the largest uncertainty in determining accurate masses and luminosities .",
    "outflow cavities and asymmetrical density distributions should be modeled using higher dimensional dust modeling . in particular , l483 and l1527 have large asymmetries in the dust continuum emission that can not be modeled with a one dimensional code .",
    "the presence of a disk within the central beam may affect the interpretation of the best fit density distribution in the outer envelope , decreasing @xmath4 by as much as @xmath216 .",
    "we can now use a more realistic @xmath32 and @xmath222 in monte carlo molecular line radiative transfer models to test infall models ( which provide @xmath223 ) and the origin of line asymmetries , to test predictions of chemical models , to investigate amounts of depletion , and to improve estimates of the ionization fraction .",
    "our primary conclusion is that a simple power law for the density distribution fits all of the class 0 sources that we have considered , while shu77 models with substantial @xmath224 do not fit .",
    "firmer conclusions await stronger constraints on the submillimeter flux from a possible disk and modeling of interferometric observations of class 0 protostars .",
