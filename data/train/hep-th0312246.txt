    "in view of the evidence for the accelerated expansion of the universe , it is of interest to understand whether there exist consistent and phenomenologically acceptable gravitational theories which deviate from general relativity at cosmological scales .",
    "the simplest possibility would be to give a mass to the graviton by adding the fierz ",
    "pauli term  @xcite to the einstein action . at the linearized level",
    ", this would modify classical gravity even at energy scales exceeding the graviton mass , due to the van dam  veltman ",
    "zakharov phenomenon  @xcite , but this undesirable feature may be cured by non - linear effects  @xcite .",
    "more serious problem emerges at quantum level : it has been argued  @xcite that the theory becomes strongly coupled above the energy scale @xmath2 where @xmath1 is the graviton mass . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the present value of the hubble parameter , this scale is unacceptably low .",
    "possible higher order terms do not improve the ultraviolet behaviour to phenomenologically acceptable level  @xcite . similar problem is inherent also in brane - world models  @xcite with gravity modifed at ultra - large distances : they either are strongly coupled at unacceptably low energies  @xcite or have ghosts  @xcite .",
    "a possible way out is related to the breaking of the lorentz invariance , as suggested recently  @xcite .",
    "the energy scale  ( [ scale ] ) was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite in a somewhat indirect way , namely , by making use of a gravitational analogue of the sigma - model approach .",
    "it is of interest to see this scale directly in scattering amplitudes and loop corrections .",
    "this is precisely the purpose of this paper : we calculate directly the @xmath4 scattering amplitude of longitudinal gravitons ( figs .",
    "[ scat4 ] and [ scat3 ] )            and the loop correction to the graviton propagator ( fig .",
    "[ interact ] ) , both in flat background .",
    "we confirm that the strong coupling scale in massive gravity is given by eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) .",
    "this scale appears in the two calculations in a way which is not completely trivial : a nave power couting would suggest even lower energy scale , but two leading orders in @xmath5 cancel out in both cases . as an example",
    ", the wave function of the longitudinal graviton is proportional to @xmath6 , while the largest term in the graviton propagator is proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "thus , nave power couting would suggest that the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ scat3 ] are of the order @xmath8 .",
    "however , on - shell amplitude is in fact of order @xmath9 , due to cancellations .",
    "this immediately implies that the strong interaction scale is indeed given by eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) .",
    "the graviton field @xmath10 is the perturbation about the minkowski metric @xmath11 , @xmath12 the graviton is given a mass by adding the fierz - pauli term  @xcite to the einstein action , @xmath13 where the indices of @xmath10 are raised by the minkowski metric .    by solving the linearised field equation",
    ", one finds that the graviton field has a mass , @xmath14 , and is decomposed as follows , @xmath15 where the five polarisation tensors have the following proprieties , @xmath16 and the creation and annihilation operators are normalized in the standard way , @xmath17 = ( 2\\pi)^3 ( 2k^0 ) \\delta^3({\\bf k}-{\\bf k ' } ) \\delta^{\\alpha\\beta}\\ ] ]    the five polarisation tensors @xmath18 of the massive graviton can be expressed in terms of the three polarisation vectors @xmath19 of the massive vector field , @xmath20 where the two first polarisation tensors ( as well as the two first polarisation vectors ) are the ones of the massless case .    in a frame where @xmath21 , one has @xmath22 hence , the longitudinal tensor @xmath23 is the most singular one as @xmath24 . for further calculations it is convenient to express it in terms of momentum",
    ", @xmath25    the graviton propagator obeys the following equation , @xmath26g^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\nu}(k)&=&\\frac{i}{2 } \\left ( \\delta_\\gamma^\\mu \\delta_\\delta^\\nu + \\delta_\\gamma^\\nu \\delta_\\delta^\\mu \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one finds that the massive graviton propagator contains terms of order @xmath27 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath28\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the propagator can also be written as follows , @xmath29\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 . the coefficient @xmath31 here is different from @xmath32 of the massless case ; this is precisely the van dam  veltman ",
    "zakharov discontinuity  @xcite .    as a cross check ,",
    "near mass shell one has @xmath33 which is precisely the expected contribution of the nearly on - shell gravitons .",
    "interaction between gravitons comes from non - linear terms in the einstein action .",
    "the corresponding three - point and four - point vertices are given in appendix .",
    "we use them for calculating the amplitude of scattering of two massive gravitons ; at the tree level it is given by the sum of the diagrams shown in figs .",
    "[ scat4 ] and [ scat3 ] .    by nave",
    "power counting , one might think that the term of order @xmath7 in the massive propagator  ( [ prop ] ) dominates the scattering amplitude .",
    "however , once the explicit form of the vertex  ( [ 3pt ] ) is used , and external legs are taken on - shell , its contribution in fact picks up a factor @xmath34 . likewise , the term in the propagator with @xmath6 in front picks up a factor @xmath35 , so effectively the propagator is of order @xmath36 .",
    "these cancellations occur for each diagram in fig .",
    "[ scat3 ] separately , and for all polarisations of gravitons in the legs , provided these are on - shell .",
    "then , the inverse powers of the mass @xmath1 in the scattering amplitude come only from the polarisation tensor @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the largest amplitude at @xmath37 involves longitudinal gravitons in all four legs . making use of eq .",
    "( [ polapprox ] ) , we obtain for the diagram of fig .",
    "[ scat4 ] , the diagram of fig .",
    "[ scat3 ] and their sum : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the mandelstam variables .",
    "these expressions are symmetric in @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 as they should .",
    "thus , at high energies the @xmath4 amplitude for longitudinal gravitons is of the order @xmath42 where @xmath43 is precisely the scale  ( [ scale ] ) .",
    "the standard unitarity argument implies then that the theory is strongly coupled at @xmath44 , in agreement with ref .",
    "another way to see the strong coupling scale is to study the loop correction to the graviton propagator .",
    "we do this by adding external sources of the form @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and calculating the interaction between @xmath47 and @xmath48 . at the tree level ,",
    "the interaction between two symmetric conserved sources @xmath49 and @xmath50 is @xmath51    we now calculate the interaction at the one loop order ; the corresponding diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ interact ] .",
    "we are interested in the regime @xmath52 .",
    "as the sources are transverse , all terms in the propagator enhanced by @xmath7 and @xmath6 vanish upon contracting with @xmath47 or @xmath53 , exept for one term .",
    "this non - vanishing term is of the form @xmath54 , where the two indices of the minkowski metric are contracted with the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "so , one might think that for the first diagram of fig .",
    "[ interact ] , the two propagators in the loop each contribute as @xmath7 , and the two external propagators each contribute as @xmath6 .",
    "this would lead to a result of the order @xmath55 , but as in the previous section there are cancellations . unlike in the previous section , however , these cancellations have nothing to do with the mass - shell condition . by direct calculation",
    "one finds that the terms of order @xmath55 and @xmath56 vanish , so one is left with contribution of order @xmath57 from the first diagram of fig .",
    "[ interact ] .",
    "the second diagram has only one propagator inside the loop , so it is at most of order @xmath57 .    to check that the terms of order @xmath57 do not cancel out , it is sufficient to consider traceless sources , @xmath58 this simplifies algebra considerably ( in particular , the second diagram in fig .",
    "[ interact ] does not contribute to the order @xmath57 ) , and we obtain for the sum of the tree level and one - loop interactions , @xmath59 { { \\tilde{t}}'}{}^{\\gamma\\delta}(-k)\\nonumber\\\\&= & \\int \\frac{d^4k}{(2\\pi)^4 } \\tilde{t}^{\\alpha\\beta}(k ) { { \\tilde{t}}_{\\alpha\\beta}'}(-k ) \\frac{32 \\pi i}{m_{pl}^2 ( k^2 - m^2)}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left(1+\\frac{k^{10}}{2160\\pi m_{pl}^2 m^8 } \\log(k^2 ) + \\frac{p(k)}{m_{pl}^2 m^8}+\\frac{{\\cal o } ( m^{-6})}{m_{pl}^2}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is a polynomial in @xmath61 .    thus , the correction of order @xmath57 does not cancel out in the graviton propagator , even for traceless sources .",
    "this correction becomes comparable to the tree level term at the energy scale @xmath43 , eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) .",
    "this again demonstrates that @xmath43 is indeed the strong coupling scale in massive gravity .",
