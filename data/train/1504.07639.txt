    "the physical processes relevant to star formation have conspired to produce stars of predominantly low mass for most of the history of the universe .",
    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) appears to be so robust to variations in environment that debate over its universality primarily concerns whether the statement `` the imf is universal '' should include the word _",
    "excellent reviews of this subject have been provided by @xcite and more recently , .",
    "the one notable exception to the universality of the imf is the case of metal - free ( population iii or pop iii ) stars .",
    "the mid 2000s was a boom for quality reviews of this subject .",
    "in short , neutral metal - free gas cools very inefficiently as it collapses , resulting in jeans mass - scale fragments that are of the order of thousands of m@xmath1 .",
    "early simulations found that this resulted in the formation of only one @xcite or two @xcite dense cores that were free to accrete from this massive envelope and grow uncontested .",
    "more recent simulations have found that the disks surrounding the massive , central core can be unstable to fragmentation , potentially providing a channel for lower mass pop iii stars @xcite .",
    "however , simulations that follow the late - time accretion onto the central object find that they will grow to be 10s to 1000s of m@xmath1 in final size @xcite , making it quite clear that the pop iii star formation mode is , at a bare minimum , unquestionably distinct .",
    "even on the low mass end of the pop iii imf , @xcite claim that the existing sample size of low - metallicity star surveys in the milky way can already rule out the existence of metal - free stars below 0.65 m@xmath1 with 95% certainty , barring enrichment via accretion of metals from the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "following naturally from the idea that the first stars to ever form in the universe represent an exception to the universal stellar imf is the question of how this necessary transition in star formation modes took place .",
    "the universe was forever changed when supernovae from the first stars created the first metals , whose introduction to star - forming gas enhanced its ability to cool and fragment . from this argument of increased cooling and fragmentation , two `` critical metallicities '' have been found for yielding a significant departure from the thermal evolution of collapsing metal - free gas . at low densities , @xmath3 @xmath4 ,",
    "fine - structure lines of atomic c and o allow collapsing gas to continue to cool past the limitations of metal - free coolants ( primarily h@xmath5 ) at a metallicity of @xmath6 z@xmath1 @xcite . at much higher densities , @xmath7 @xmath4 ,",
    "dust emission can induce a sharp cooling phase when the metallicity is only @xmath8 z@xmath1 , assuming the dust - to - gas ratio scales with the gas - phase metallicity @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations have shown that the cooling phases that occur when these critical metallicities are reached can indeed trigger fragmentation in their associated density regimes ( @xcite for the atomic and @xcite for the dust critical metallicity ) .",
    "however , it has also been found that the ability of gas to actually fragment depends sensitively on the initial conditions , no matter what the metallicity @xcite . in particular , without a small amount of turbulence to create seed perturbations , monolithic collapse can not be avoided @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems that further progress requires understanding the true physical conditions in which the first metal - enriched stars formed .",
    "this paper is the first in a series that will investigate the range of scenarios in which star formation producing the near - universal imf first occurred . noting the ability of pop iii stars to completely evacuate their host mini - halos through ionizing radiation and supernovae @xcite , a number of recent works have sought to characterize the required conditions for metal - enriched star formation in terms of ( i ) incorporation of metals via hierarchical structure formation into more massive halos @xcite or ( ii ) fallback onto the original halo after after a recovery period @xcite .",
    "these are both viable scenarios , but because they typically involve stars forming with metallicities of z @xmath9 z@xmath1 , they are unlikely to be the formation mechanisms of the most metal - poor stars observed with [ fe / h ] refers to the log@xmath10 of the iron abundance relative to the sun . ]",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we report on a third scenario for low - metallicity star formation , whereby mini - halos that have yet to form stars are externally enriched by a pop iii supernova from a nearby halo .",
    "we note that while this channel has not before been shown conclusively to give rise pop ii - like stars , it was previously suggested as a possibility by @xcite , who found a halo similar to what we describe here but did not have the ability to follow the collapse and fragmentation .",
    "this is also similar to the `` gravitational enrichment '' scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "the simulations presented here are the first of their kind to follow the metal creation , non - uniform enrichment of the surrounding medium , and eventual collapse to high density within a single , coherent run .",
    "as such , they represent a significant leap forward in understanding the origins of the first low - mass stars .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : methods ] , we describe the simulation code and the setup of the simulations .",
    "we present the results in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we first describe the general evolution of the simulation in section [ sec : evolution ] .",
    "we then investigate the process by which the pop ii star - forming halo is enriched through turbulent mixing with the supernova blast - wave in section [ sec : enrichment ] .",
    "following this , we characterize the physical conditions within the star - forming cloud , including fragmentation , the role of dust , and the velocity structure of the gas in section [ sec : phys - cond ] .",
    "we conclude the results in section [ sec : andthen ] by estimating how often stars will form via this external enrichment mechanism . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the implications of these results and some limitations of our work . finally , we summarize the results and discuss the ways in which this work may be extended in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we use the simulation code @xcite for all simulations presented here .",
    "is an open - source , adaptive mesh refinement + n - body cosmological simulation code that has been heavily used for simulating cosmological structure formation over a large range of scales .  has been employed by numerous works to study high - redshift structure formation , including pop iii star formation @xcite , low - metallicity star formation @xcite , and the first galaxies .",
    "all functionality of the  code is thoroughly detailed in @xcite , but we briefly describe the most relevant machinery here",
    ".  uses a block - structured adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) framework @xcite to solve the equations of ideal hydrodynamics in an eulerian frame , with multiple hydrodynamic solvers implemented . for these simulations",
    ", we use the piecewise parabolic method of @xcite .",
    "this is coupled to an n - body adaptive particle - mesh gravity solver @xcite .",
    "when ionizing radiation fields from stellar sources are present ( described below in sections [ sec : chem ] and [ sec : starff ] ) , we also use the  adaptive ray - tracing radiation transport method of @xcite .",
    "the amr framework dynamically creates ( refines ) and destroys ( de - refines ) grid patches at varying levels of resolution based on multiple criteria .",
    "this enables the study of astrophysical phenomena with processes occurring over a large range of spatial and temporal scales .",
    "we list the refinement criteria employed in this work below in section [ sec : simsetup ] .",
    "we use a chemistry model that follows the non - equilibrium evolution of 12 primordial species ( h , h@xmath12 , he , he@xmath12 , he@xmath13 , e@xmath14 , h@xmath15 , h@xmath16 , h@xmath14 , d , d@xmath12 , and hd ) following the method originally described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this method has been updated to include h@xmath5 formation via three - body reactions @xcite , h@xmath15 formation heating , and collisionally - induced h@xmath15 emission @xcite .",
    "we include the effects of ionizing radiation from pop iii stars by coupling the chemistry network to the  radiation transport solver @xcite .",
    "we also include optically thin , h@xmath15 photo - dissociating lyman - werner ( lw ) radiation with an intensity decreasing as @xmath17 from the source together with the h@xmath5 `` sobolev - like '' self - shielding model of @xcite .",
    "just as primordial chemistry appears simple enough to allow for the hope that it can be computed entirely without limiting assumptions in a large , three - dimensional simulation , the introduction of the first heavy elements by pop iii supernovae adds a level of complexity to the universe that crushes that hope .",
    "we calculate the cooling from gas - phase metals following the method of @xcite , which uses multidimensional tables pre - computed with the photoionization code , cloudy @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the cooling from metals corresponds to a solar abundance pattern .",
    "when pop iii stars are present , we use a four - dimensional cooling table that spans the parameter space of density , metallicity , temperature , and electron fraction to account for the increased ionization from the radiation field .",
    "when metal - enriched gas begins to reach high densities , we switch to a table that covers only density , metallicity , and temperature , but was computed up to higher densities than the four - dimensional table .",
    "in addition to gas - phase chemistry and cooling , we also take into account the contribution of dust grains , which provide an additional channel for h@xmath5 formation and an efficient cooling mechanism at high densities .",
    "the implementation used here closely follows the work of @xcite and @xcite , with modifications motivated by @xcite , and is detailed in @xcite .",
    "the primary assumption to note is that the gas - to - dust ratio scales with the metallicity and that the grain size distribution and abundances follow the model of @xcite , as in @xcite .",
    "we model the formation and feedback of pop iii stars with the method presented in @xcite . during the simulation , we insert a pop iii star particle into a grid cell where the following conditions are met :    1 .",
    "the _ proper _ baryon number density exceeds @xmath18  @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   the gas flow is convergent ( @xmath19 ) .",

    "4 .   the metallicity is less than 10@xmath25 z@xmath1 .",
    "if the metallicity is greater than this , we will explicitly follow the collapse .",
    "these physical conditions are typical of metal - free molecular clouds nearing the end of the ` loitering ' phase observed in simulations of pop iii star formation @xcite . in the simulations here",
    ", we adopt a delta function at m = 40 m@xmath1 for the imf of the pop iii star particles .",
    "when a star particle is created , the mass of the star is removed evenly from a spherical region containing twice the particle mass .",
    "once formed , the star particle isotropically emits ionizing and lw radiation following the stellar evolution models of with no mass loss . following this ,",
    "the main - sequence lifetime of the 40 m@xmath1 pop iii star is 3.86 myr .",
    "furthermore , we treat the star as a radiation point source , whose spectrum is discretised into four energy groups with the following photon energies and luminosities : ( i ) hydrogen ionizing photons with @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; ( ii ) helium singly - ionizing photons with @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; ( iii ) helium doubly - ionizing photons with @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; ( iv ) h@xmath15 dissociating photons with @xmath32 .",
    "the ionizing radiation field is transported using the  radiation transport solver @xcite .",
    "as stated previously , we model the h@xmath5 photo - dissociating lw flux to be declining simply as r@xmath33 with a self - shielding correction .",
    "when the pop iii star s main - sequence lifetime ends , it explodes as a standard type ii core - collapse supernova with an explosion energy of @xmath34  ergs .",
    "following the calculations of @xcite , the supernova has a metal yield of 11.19  m@xmath1 and a total ejecta mass of 38.6  m@xmath1 .",
    "we model the blast - wave by depositing the explosion energy and mass into a sphere with a radius of 10 proper pc that has been smoothed at its surface to improve numerical stability @xcite .",
    "we choose this radius as it marks the end of the free - expansion phase of the supernova . at the time of instantiation ,",
    "the blast - wave is extremely well - resolved and agrees with the sedov - taylor solution .",
    "we initialize the simulation with a 500 kpc / h comoving box at @xmath35 using the music initial conditions generator @xcite with the wmap 7 best - fit cosmological parameters , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , h@xmath39  km / s / mpc , @xmath40 , and n@xmath41 @xcite , and using a @xcite transfer function and second - order lagrangian perturbation theory .",
    "we first run an exploratory dark matter - only simulation with 512@xmath42 particles to @xmath43 .",
    "we then use the rockstar halo finder ( * ? ? ?",
    "* interfaced through the  analysis toolkit ) and the consistent - trees merger tree algorithm @xcite to locate a halo with total mass ( at @xmath44 ) of @xmath45  m@xmath1 and the highest number of unique progenitor halos with m @xmath46 m@xmath1 .",
    "the second of these criteria was added to maximize the number of pop iii stars formed , and hence the amount of metals produced , by the time the halo has reached z = 10 .",
    "the halo selected , referred to from here on as the `` target halo '' , has a total mass at @xmath43 of @xmath47 m@xmath1 and 4 unique progenitors with m @xmath46 m@xmath1 ( and 7 with m @xmath48 m@xmath1 . )    we generate the initial conditions for the primary simulation using the same configuration and random seed as the exploratory run , including baryons as well as dark matter , and with two additional levels of telescoping refinement around the target halo .",
    "the high resolution region is a rectangular prism minimally containing all of the dark matter particles that end up within 3 virial radii of the target halo .",
    "it has an effective resolution of 2048@xmath42 , corresponding to a comoving spatial resolution of 0.244  kpc / h , and a baryon ( dark matter ) mass resolution of 0.259  m@xmath1 ( 1.274  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "we evolve the simulation from @xmath49 with the physics described in section [ sec : code ] , allowing adaptive mesh refinement to occur only within the high resolution region .",
    "grid cells are adaptively refined by factors of 2 in each dimension when any of the following conditions exist :",
    "the dark matter mass within a grid cell is greater than 4 times the initial mass ( i.e. , when more than 4 dark matter particles are in the same cell ) .",
    "2 .   the gas mass within a grid cell is greater than 4 times the mean baryon mass per cell on the root grid multiplied by a factor , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the refinement level .",
    "the local jeans length is resolved by less than 64 cells .",
    "the negative exponential factor used with the baryon mass criterion ensures that refinement is mildly super - lagrangian . requiring that the local jeans length be resolved by at least 64 cells ( a factor of 16 higher than the criterion put forth by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been shown to be necessary to guarantee that fragmentation is purely physical in origin @xcite .",
    "we place no strict limit on the maximum number of amr levels in the simulation .",
    "however , in practice , the simulation typically reaches 15 levels of refinement before forming a pop iii star , corresponding to a comoving spatial resolution of 0.03 pc / h .",
    "finally , we stop the simulation once gas with metallicity of at least 10@xmath25 z@xmath1 reaches a maximum number density of @xmath52 @xmath4 .",
    "this occurs at 27 levels of refinement , for a spatial resolution of approximately 1.5 au / h comoving . as discussed in section [ sec : phys - cond ] ,",
    "after the first pop iii supernova occurs , we start a second simulation from this point with all physics the same except without dust grains .",
    "we run the simulations on the blue waters supercomputer at the national center for supercomputing applications on 64 nodes of the machine , using 8 cores / node .",
    "the primary run took roughly 42 days , with a total computational cost of approximately @xmath53 node - hours .",
    "for all of the analysis and images presented here , we use the simulation analysis toolkit @xcite .",
    "the two simulations proceed identically until the collapse of metal - enriched gas first occurs at @xmath54 , at which time their behaviors diverge due to the presence / absense of dust grains .",
    "the qualitative evolution prior to this is as follows . from here on , we refer to the halo in which metal - enriched collapse occurs as the `` action halo . '' within the high resolution region , two pop iii stars form in separate halos , shine , and explode .",
    "the evolution of the halos hosting pop iii stars agrees well with earlier studies of this scenario @xcite .",
    "as the halos are only a few hundred thousand m@xmath1 , the pop iii star is able to completely photo - evaporate them .",
    "the central baryon density is reduced to roughly 0.1 @xmath4 before the core - collapse supernova occurs and totally evacuates the gas from the halo . as in @xcite ,",
    "the supernova shockwave has a density of just under 1 @xmath4 and catches up with the expanding shell of the hii region within a few million years of the explosion .",
    "this collision enhances the density by a factor of roughly 10 to 30 , after which the shell proceeds to break up into small knots .",
    "these knots eventually dissolve , but they carry metals out into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , creating finger - like structures in the metal field , which are clearly visible in the upper - right panel of figure [ fig : halos ] .",

    "prior to this , the action halo has a relatively low central baryon fraction , about a few percent of the cosmic baryon to dark matter ratio . over the main sequence lifetime of the star , the central density of the action halo increases by a factor of a few , raising the baryon fraction to over 10% of @xmath58 .",
    "the gas in the action halo remains almost entirely neutral , with an hii fraction of about 10@xmath59 in the central 10 pc , increasing to 10@xmath33 at 50 pc .",

    "it also happens that the blast - wave encounters the action halo just prior to colliding with the hii region shell and thus meets the halo with an enhanced density .",
    "this process is illustrated in figure [ fig : mixing ] .",
    "finally , runaway collapse occurs in the center of the action halo where the metallicity has reached @xmath0 z@xmath1 . while this is happening , the action halo and the gas - depleted pop iii halo continue on a near collision course . by the time collapse occurs , the two halos have passed close enough that the halo finder considers them to be a single halo , although distinct cores are still visible .",

    "note , the refinement region is in a large - scale overdensity and has roughly 2.8 times more mass than an average region of that size .",
    ", scaledwidth=47.0% ]        finally , we briefly examine the velocity structure of the collapsing gas cloud in figure [ fig : velocities ] . here , as in figures [ fig : timescales ] and [ fig : metal_mass ] , we calculate the center of the cloud by creating a sphere of 100 pc centered on the halo , and iteratively recalculating the center of mass after decreasing the radius of the sphere by 10% until reaching a radius of 1 au proper . for the velocity profiles , we subtract off the bulk velocity of the central 1 au .",
    "we define the rotational velocity as the component that is orthogonal to both the radial and angular momentum vectors , where the angular momentum vector is calculated from the central 1 au .",
    "the cloud is dominated by turbulent , or at least unordered , motion as the variance of the velocity magnitude ( minus the bulk velocity of the center ) is higher than both the radial and rotational components at all radii . at large radii",
    ", the velocity variance is between 1.5 and 2 times the sound speed and closely follows the sound speed at lower radii , only exceeding it at r @xmath57 10 au where the cooling leads to rapid cooling .",
    "though less than the variance at all radii , there is still a significant infall component that is generally trans - sonic .",
    "we find that in the simulation without dust where the gas temperature slightly higher , the infall is similarly raised .",
    "the gas shows almost no coherent rotation with an average rotational velocity that is near zero at virtually all radii .",
    "this is not simply an effect of where we have chosen to calculate the angular momentum vector as we find that calculating it at r = 10 and 100 au gives qualitatively similar results .",
    "the gravitational binding energy of mini - halos is well below the energy of even a standard core - collapse supernova . as such",
    ", it will be some time before metal - enriched stars are able to form in - situ from self - enrichment of the progenitor halos that form pop iii stars .",
    "however , just two pop iii stars have enriched a considerable amount of space and material by z @xmath57 16.6 , when this simulation stops . in figures [ fig : metal_volume_profile ] and [ fig : metal_mass_profile ] , we show the volume and mass enriched to metallicities high enough to transition to a metal - enriched star formation mode .",
    "roughly 1% of the mass and just under 1% of the volume within the high - resolution region of the simulation are enriched to a metallicity of 10@xmath63 z@xmath1 by the final output .",
    "only a small fraction of the metals created in the two supernovae will be captured by nearby halos and be incorporated into stars by the time the target halo has assembled at @xmath43 with a total mass of @xmath57@xmath89 m@xmath1 , about 250 myr from the current time in the simulation .",
    "if metal - enriched star formation occurs on free - fall timescales , this 250 myr time period corresponds to a density of roughly 10@xmath90 g / cm@xmath42 . following this assumption",
    ", we can estimate the number of additional halos externally enriched by these two pop iii supernovae that will be able to form pop ii stars in this time period by searching for all the halos with metallicities of at least 10@xmath25 z@xmath1 in gas with @xmath91 g / cm@xmath42 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : halos ] , we show the results of this attempt to predict the future . in this exercise ,",
    "we consider halos with masses as low as 10@xmath42 m@xmath1 .",
    "we identify 21 halos in which pop ii stars could form before the target halo has assembled . in cases where the metallicity is less than @xmath84 z@xmath1",
    ", gas - phase metal cooling will be insufficient at low densities , requiring a critical h@xmath5 fraction in a scenario analogous to the filtering mass for pop iii star formation @xcite . to account for this , we require halos with z @xmath92 z@xmath1 to have a minimum mass of 10@xmath93 m@xmath1 . in other words ,",
    "halos with m @xmath94",
    "10@xmath93 m@xmath1 must have metallicities of at least 10@xmath59 z@xmath1 such that they are able to cool via metal lines .",
    "this constraint lowers the number of candidate halos to 16 .",
    "of these 16 halos , 7 have masses of 10@xmath42 m@xmath95 m @xmath96 m@xmath1 , 6 have masses of 10@xmath97 m@xmath95 m @xmath98 m@xmath1 , and 3 have masses of 10@xmath93 m@xmath95 m @xmath99 m@xmath1 . despite having a 66 myr head",
    "start , only 1 of the 16 candidate halos exists in the region enriched by the first of the two supernovae .",
    "in fact , this halo is the original host of the pop iii star . out of random chance , the halo hosting the first pop iii star has significantly fewer neighbors than that of the second pop iii star .",
    "it has been approximately 96 myr since the explosion of the first supernova .",
    "that this halo has not yet recovered is consistent with @xcite , who find a recovery time of 140 myr for a 3@xmath100 m@xmath1 halo experiencing a 10@xmath101 erg explosion .",
    "the lower panels of figure [ fig : halos ] show that the halo hosting the second pop iii star ( as well as the action halo ) formed in a significantly denser region with many more neighboring halos . out of the 22.39 m@xmath1 of metals created , about 1.8 m@xmath1",
    "have been captured by neighboring halos .",
    "it is important to note that as metal - enriched stars form within region b of figure [ fig : halos ] , their feedback may influence other nearby candidate halos , either inhibiting star formation with radiation or contributing additional metals via supernovae .",
    "thus , the resulting star formation in this region may be slightly different from the picture presented here , although it is difficult to know for sure without running the simulation into the future including pop ii star particles .",
    "what is most striking is the range in metallicities resulting from a single enrichment event .",
    "a total of 7 halos have metallicities in their dense gas ( @xmath91 g / cm@xmath42 ) of at least 10@xmath61 z@xmath1 , with a single halo as high as 0.1 z@xmath1 .",
    "the halo with the highest metallicity is , in fact , the combined action / pop iii halo , represented in figure [ fig : halos ] as the large , red circle in the center of region b. the core of the pop iii halo is just barely visible to the lower - right of the main core of this structure . just after the collision with the blast - wave but before encountering the pop iii halo , the action halo experiences a major merger . the final object , including the not yet totally merged pop iii halo , has a mass of 9.8@xmath100 m@xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , it seems that it will likely form both the lowest and highest metallicity pop ii stars from the metals created thus far .",
    "more importantly , the picture presented here shows that _ the first generation of metal - enriched stars was highly heterogeneous in metallicity , encompassing significantly more than just the most metal - poor stars . _",
    "the one - zone collapse models with their extremely sophisticated chemistry networks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and related works ) have paved the way toward understanding the required conditions for fragmentation from the perspective of the ability of low metallicity gas to cool .",
    "the simplicity of the collapse model has enabled the exploration of a large parameter space of non - solar abundance patterns motivated by pop iii supernova yield predictions @xcite and varying levels of dust @xcite .",
    "encouragingly , the idealized three - dimensional simulations @xcite have confirmed that the thermal evolution predicted by these models can , indeed , induce fragmentation provided there is a small degree of turbulence to seed density perturbations .",
    "this is particularly interesting given that the recently discovered most metal - poor star , smss j031300.36 - 670839.3 @xcite , has abundance patterns compatible with the yield of a single pop iii supernova @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite have shown that , under a range of dust abundances , a collapsing gas - cloud with the chemical composition of smss j031300.36 - 670839.3 would have undergone low - mass fragmentation .",
    "what has been missing from this picture is a means to implant such low metallicities into a star forming environment .",
    "we have provided such a mechanism in this work .",
    "the frequency with which this mechanism operates is uncertain , although it is also encouraging that @xcite appear to have identified a similar situation , albeit with a higher metallicity ( z @xmath102 z@xmath1 ) .",
    "we have , so far , only followed this one occurrence , although we identify a number of other externally enriched halos that could potentially form stars with metals from a single supernova .",
    "however , it is clear that the number of halos externally enriched by a given pop iii supernova will vary greatly .",
    "for example , the region around the first pop iii star in our simulation has no viable externally enriched halo candidates and will see second generation star formation only after the pop iii halo itself recovers .",
    "by contrast , the region around the second pop iii star has a number of such candidates .",
    "to first order , the likelihood of the external enrichment mechanism depends on the average separation of pop iii star - forming halos from mini - halos that have yet to undergo star formation .",
    "we provide a crude estimate of this in figure [ fig : neighbors ] . using the exploratory simulation ,",
    "we identify all halos with masses greater than 10@xmath93 m@xmath1 and calculate the distance to the nearest halo with a mass in the range of 10@xmath93 m@xmath103 m @xmath2 m@xmath1 .",
    "the former group is assumed to have a high probability of forming a pop iii star , where the latter may be just about to do so .",
    "we allow the mass ranges to overlap noting that the action halo is actually more massive than the pop iii halo . during the period from z = 20 to z = 10 ,",
    "the average separation of these pairs is roughly 500 pc and evolves very little .",
    "the high resolution region of the simulation shows a similar evolution but with a slightly lower value of about 300400 pc owing to the fact that it is located within a large - scale overdensity .",
    "the distance between the pop iii halo and the action halo is slightly more than 1 standard deviation lower than the average pair separation within the full simulation volume .",
    "this suggests that the external enrichment mechanism is a non - negligible component of low - metallicity star formation .",
    "@xcite find that the recovery time for mini - halos with m @xmath104 m@xmath1 ( similar to the pop iii star - forming halos in our simulations ) is of the order of 100 myr . in the simulations presented here ,",
    "the time between the explosion of the second supernova and the collapse of metal - enriched gas is roughly 25 myr .",
    "the shorter timescale is not surprising , as the mixing of metals into a nearby halo will occur early on when the blast - wave is still moving outward quickly .",
    "thus , if the conditions are right for the external enrichment mechanism to occur , it should typically produce metal - enriched stars before they can form from fallback of metals onto the pop iii halo .",
    "m@xmath1 , and the nearest halo with mass , 10@xmath93 m@xmath103 m @xmath2 m@xmath1 as a function of redshift for the entire simulation volume .",
    "the red line and shaded region shows the measurement for just the high resolution region . the green line shows the distance between the action halo and the pop iii star - forming halo .",
    "the three black stars indicate the moments when the pop iii star forms , explodes , and when the supernova blast - wave collides with the action halo .",
    ", scaledwidth=47.0% ]    finally , the candidate halos surrounding the second pop iii star have a wide range of metallicities , from just over 10@xmath59 z@xmath1 to nearly 10@xmath33 z@xmath1 .",
    "this range of metallicities is , itself , a striking result as it implies that there may be stars that are only moderately metal - poor by observational standards ( with , e.g. , thousands existing in the sdss segue sample ) yet trace a single progenitor .",
    "this could present a new opportunity to gain access to the pop iii imf , although one that will certainly not be without its own challenges .",
    "we make strong assumptions about the properties of the metals and dust grains in these simulations .",
    "we assume that gas - phase metals have a solar abundance pattern and that the dust grains are of a composition , size distribution , and fraction of total metal mass identical to the interstellar medium of the milky way .",
    "while these assumptions are not explicitly correct , the thermal evolution we observe is still in reasonable agreement with studies that use realistic abundance patterns and dust properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also assume that the dust grain population is static after the inital grain formation , although it has been shown recently that grains can continue to grow during collapse and that their effects can be important even when the initial depletion fraction is very small @xcite .",
    "these effects , along with more realistic abundance patterns , will be important to consider in the future when these simulations can be carried to the point where an imf can be reasonably extrapolated from their final state .",
    "however , given the current lack of understanding of the physical origin of the stellar imf , such an exercise is not warranted at this time . in relation to the chemistry model employed here , the primary goal of this work is to show that the high density cooling phase associated with dust can induce fragmentation in realistic conditions .",
    "we have chosen the formation of a 40 m@xmath1 pop iii star followed by a 10@xmath101 erg core - collapse supernova as the sole outcome of the collapse of metal - free gas . since this",
    "work deals with enrichment of star forming gas by a single supernova , this assumption is as valid as choosing from a realistic imf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provided that the mass chosen is plausible within that imf , which in this case is true .",
    "however , given the range of alternative pop iii explosion scenarios , such as energetic hypernova @xcite and pair - instability supernova @xcite , determining the robustness of the external enrichment mechanism to different explosion energies and yields has significant merit and is a topic we will explore in a future study .",
    "for example , @xcite claim that the lack of observational evidence for pop iii pair - instability supernova does not necessarily rule out their existence entirely .",
    "instead , they argue that the transition to pop ii star formation may simply be dominated by low energy supernovae whose ejecta fall back quickly while pair - instability events are masked by the fact that they evacuate their host halos and have very long recovery times . however ,",
    "if pair - instability supernovae can just as easily give rise to the external enrichment mechanism presented here , it could present a problem for this explanation .    given the nature of our code ,",
    "which is both grid - based and uses adaptive mesh refinement , it is possible that the mixing of metals is artificially enhanced in our second - generation halo .",
    "this is a known property of grid - based codes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and must be kept in mind when interpreting results such as those presented in figure  [ fig : metallicity ] . in this particular simulation",
    ", however , there is reason to believe that numerical mixing is not the origin of the uniform metallicity seen in the center of our second - generation halo .",
    "this is due to the nature of the fluid flow in the halo , which is highly turbulent .",
    "turbulence results in the efficient mixing of metals over the length scales of the turbulent cascade on the scale of a few local eddy turnover times , which are comparable to the local dynamical time in supersonic turbulence @xcite . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : timescales ] , the dynamical , cooling , and vortical ( i.e. , turbulence ) scales are quite comparable over the inner parsec of the second - generation halo , suggesting that the gas is well - mixed .",
    "this thorough mixing may also be observed in nature ",
    "@xcite shows the tentative existence of a dissolved star cluster with [ fe / h ]  @xmath105 in the sextans dsph galaxy .",
    "this star cluster was found using chemical tagging , and found a handful of very old stars that are highly clustered in a multi - dimensional chemical abundance space .",
    "this clumping indicates chemical homogeneity in the gas cloud out of which these stars formed , which is estimated to be substantially more massive than the one under consideration in our calculation , and supports the assertion that gas should be well - mixed due to turbulent processes .",
    "we present the first results from a study designed to characterize the physical conditions associated with the transition from pop iii to pop ii star formation .",
    "we have simulated the formation of the first pop ii stars in the universe in a single , coherent simulation beginning from cosmological initial conditions .",
    "the simulations have a dark matter particle mass of just under 1.3 m@xmath1 , allowing us to well - resolve the small ( few@xmath100 m@xmath1 ) mini - halos that host the first stars .",
    "we insert 40 m@xmath1 pop iii star particles in metal - free molecular clouds that have evolved past the loitering phase and simulate their main - sequence lives with radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "each pop iii star explodes in a 10@xmath101 erg core - collapse supernova and we follow the non - uniform enrichment of the igm and turbulent mixing that occurs as the blast - wave washes over neighboring halos .",
    "the simulation ends when metal - enriched gas is able to cool and collapse into dense , pre - stellar cores .",
    "the key results from this work are as follows :    1 .",
    "the first metal - enriched stars form at z @xmath106 when a single pop iii supernova blast - wave washes over a neighboring mini - halo of comparable size that has yet to form its own pop iii star .",
    "turbulence caused by the virialization of the halo and collision with the blast - wave allows metals to reach the interior of the halo .",
    "the gas within 0.01 pc of the dense core is uniformly mixed to a metallicity of @xmath0 z@xmath1 .",
    "2 .   because the metallicity of the dense core is less than the gas - phase critical metallicity ( z@xmath107 z@xmath1 )",
    ", the thermal evolution of the gas as it collapses is similar to the metal - free case until dust cooling becomes efficient at n @xmath57 10@xmath108 @xmath4 . at this point ,",
    "a sharp drop in temperature occurs that induces significant fragmentation into many small clumps with masses of roughly 10@xmath59 m@xmath1 .",
    "we run a second version of this simulation without dust and observe greatly reduced fragmentation .",
    "the velocity structure of the gas is dominated by turbulent motions at all scales , from @xmath57100 pc ( the outskirts of the halo ) down to a few au .",
    "the turbulent velocity , defined as the variance in the total velocity magnitude , roughly follows the local sound . at large radii , where efficient mixing occurs , the turbulent velocity reaches as high as mach 2 .",
    "the radial velocity also follows the local sound speed , but is somewhat smaller .",
    "the gas shows virtually no coherent rotation on any scale .",
    "4 .   by the end of the simulation",
    ", two pop iii supernovae have exploded in separate regions .",
    "the region in which the first supernova explodes has relatively few halos . as a result , only the original host halo of the pop iii star exists as a potential site for second generation star formation in this region . however , 15 halos exist in the region around the second supernova that have metal - enriched gas dense enough to form stars by the time that the larger structure encompassing them has assembled at z = 10 . not counting the pop iii host halo ,",
    "these halos have metallicities ranging from slightly over 10@xmath59 z@xmath1 to nearly 10@xmath33 z@xmath1 .",
    "thus , the first pop ii stars may have had a wide range of metallicities .",
    "we have identified one pathway , however small , from the exoticism of the early universe to the normalcy of the present day .",
    "it is likely that multiple scenarios contributed to the transition from pop iii to pop ii star formation .",
    "while its overall contribution to pop ii star formation is probably minor , the external enrichment mechanism offers the best explanation for the origin of the most metal - poor stars observed and the clearest window into imf of the first stars .",
