    "this idea was formulated in a two - tensor theory of strong and gravitational interactions , where the strong tensor fields are governed by einstein - type field equations with a strong gravitational constant @xmath2 times the newtonian constant @xmath3 . within the framework of this proposal ,",
    "tensor fields were identified to play a fundamental role in the strong - interaction physics of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",
    "all the calculations done in the numerical lattice qcd and other related experiments indicate that qcd , the worthy theory of strong interactions , possesses gauge symmetry based on the group @xmath4color of quantum yang - mills theory ( qymt ) .",
    "gravitational interactions also have similar symmetry ( the coordinate invariance in a space - time manifold ) , but resist quantization .",
    "this prevents physicists from constructing a quantum theory of gravity based on the gauge principle , and also inhibits the direct unification of gravity with strong interaction _ @xcite .",
    "the origin of the difficulties is now clear to us : qcd action is scale invariantly quadratic in the field strengths @xmath5 ( i.e._non - unitary _ ) and _ renormalizable , _ while the einstein - hilbert action for pure gravity is _ unitary _ and _ nonrenormalizable_. thus , the unification of gravity with qcd seems unattainable ; however , that is not the case : the valiant attempt to disprove this _",
    "prima facie _",
    "impossibility offers an outstanding example of the inspiring effect which such a very special and apparently important solution may have upon physics community .",
    "having now recalled to mind the origin of the problem , let us turn to the question of whether there is an existing unification scheme that can be used to solve the problem .",
    "strong gravity formulation is such the unification scheme that allows the gravity to be merged with qymt . in this case ,",
    "a gravitational action which possesses quadratic terms in the curvature tensor has been shown to be renormalizable ( @xcite , p.963 & p.967 ) . here , the resulting non - gauge - invariant divergences are absorbed by nonlinear renormalizations of the gravitational fields and becchi - rouet - stora transformations ( @xcite , p.953 ) . in the following , _ the dynamical breaking of the scale invariance of _ _ weyl action ( which describes the short distance behavior of strong gravity theory )",
    "induces : ( 1 ) perturbative / short - range component of  the  non - relativistic qcd potential , and non - relativistic quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) potential .",
    "( 2 ) einstein general relativity as an effective long distance limit of the theory _ @xmath1 * * this is the _ fons et origo _ of the gauge / gravity duality ; and the solution to the quantum yang - mills existence on r**@xmath0 * and dark matter problems , within the strong gravity formulation . *",
    "the catch here is that quantum gravity ( i.e. a quantum mechanically induced gravity ) can not be derived straightforwardly by quantizing nonrenormalizable einstein gr but weyl action which leads to einstein s theory of gravity at large distances@xcite ; in the same way the gauge theory of glashow - weinberg - salam , @xmath6 reduces to @xmath7 after the spontaneous symmetry breakdown@xcite .",
    "qcd possesses four remarkable properties that strong gravity must have for it to be called a complete theory of strong interactions . the   * first * is _ asymptotic freedom _ ( i.e. , the logarithmic decrease of the qcd coupling constant @xmath8 @xmath9 at large momentum transfers , or equivalently the decrease of @xmath10 at small distances , @xmath11 ) which permits one to perform consistent theoretical computations of hard processes using perturbation theory .",
    "this property also implies an increase of the running coupling constant at small momentum transfer , that is , at large distances .",
    "the * second * important property is the _",
    "_  confinement , _ _ in which quarks and gluons are confined within the domain of their strong interaction and hence can not be observed as real physical objects .",
    "the physical objects observed experimentally , at large distances , are hadrons ( mesons and baryons ) .",
    "the * third * characteristic property is the _ dynamical breakdown of chiral symmetry _ , wherein the vector gauge theories with massless dirac fermion fields @xmath12 are perfectly chiral symmetric .",
    "however , this symmetry is broken dynamically when the vector gauge theory is subjected to chiral @xmath13 rotations .",
    "this is the primary reason why chiral symmetry is not realized in the spectrum of hadrons and their low energy interactions@xcite .",
    "the * fourth * property is the _ _ mass gap(__@xmath14 _ ) . here , _ every _ _  _ _ excitation of the qcd vacuum has minimum positive energy ( i.e. @xmath15 ) ; in other words , there are no massless particles in the theory@xcite .",
    "additionally ,    strong gravity must also be able to reproduce the two fundamental parameters of qcd ( i.e. , coupling @xmath10 and fundamental quark mass @xmath16 @xcite , p.178 ) .",
    "thus , the three demands that must be met by strong gravity theory for it to be called a unification scheme for qymt - gr are :    * ( 1 ) * it must admit the four qcd properties afore - listed .    *",
    "( 2 ) * it must be able recover the fundamental parameters of qcd ( i.e. , @xmath10 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "* ( 3 ) * it must be able to reproduce einstein s general relativity as the limiting case of its long - distance behavior .",
    "any theory that fulfills these three demands can be termed `` * * a unified theory of nature**''**. * *    in the present paper , we study the structure of a dynamically broken scale - invariant quantum theory ( weyl s action ) within the context of strong gravity formulation , and its general properties .",
    "the major problem which has to be faced immediately is the unresolved question of unitarity of pure gravity : weyl s action is non - unitary while the einstein - hilbert action for pure gravity is unitary .",
    "this problem is circumvented within the framework of strong gravity : where the unitary einstein - hilbert term is induced after the breakdown of the scale invariance of weyl s action ( @xcite , p.324 ) .",
    "to put it in a proper and succinct context , einstein gr emerges from the weyl s action after the dynamical breakdown of its scale invariance .",
    "hence einstein s theory of gravity is not a fundamental theory of nature but the classical output of the more fundamental  gluon - dependent weyl s action .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . *  in section ii * , we briefly review the bcj double - copy construction of gravity scattering amplitudes . *",
    "section iii * is devoted to the review of strong gravity theory .",
    "most importantly , we prove that bcj double - copy construction exists within the strong gravity formulation .",
    "the calculation of the dimensionless strong coupling constant is done in the * section iv . *",
    "the * *  * * theoretically obtained value is tested experimentally in the * *  section v. * * we present strong gravity as a massive spin - two theory in the * section vi*. here , we show that the dynamics of strong gravity theory is fully symmetric , but its vacuum state is asymmetric .",
    "we also show in this section that electroweak and custodial symmetries can be induced dynamically .",
    "critical temperature , fundamental mass and mass gap of the qcd vacuum are obtained in the * section vii*. this leads to the derivation of the effective pure yang - mills potential .",
    "the gauge - gravity duality property of strong gravity theory is studied in the * *  section viii**. we also show that strong gravity possesses uv regularity and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in this same section .",
    "confinement and asymptotic freedom properties of the strong gravity is studied in the * section ix*. in this section , we calculate the energy density of qcd vacuum .",
    "the existence of quantum yang - mills theory on @xmath17 is established in the * section x*. the vacuum stabilizing property of higgs boson with mass @xmath18 is studied in * section xi .",
    "* the solutions to the neutrino mass , dark energy and dark matter problems are presented in the * sections xii * , * xiii * and * xiv * respectively .",
    "the physics of the repulsive gravity and cosmic inflation is presented in the * section xv*. conclusion is given in the * section xvi . *",
    "research in strong gravity has always had a rather unique flavor , due to conceptual difficulty of the field , and remoteness from experiment .",
    "we argue , in this paper , that if the conceptual misconception @xmath1 namely , that gravity is bedeviled with many untamable infinities @xmath1 that beclouds the field could be circumvented , then the complexity enshrined in the field would become highly trivialize .",
    "the most powerful tool for removing this conceptual difficulty is encoded in a long - known formalism : that the asymptotic states of gravity can be obtained as tensor products of two gauge theory states ( i.e. @xmath19 ) .",
    "this idea was extended to certain interacting theories , in 1986 , by kawai , lewellen and tye @xcite ; and to strong - gravitational theory by a. salam and c. sivaram in 1992 @xcite .",
    "the modern understanding of this double - copy formalism is largely due to the work of * * b**ern , * * c**arrasco and * * j**ohansson ( bcj ) .",
    "formally , double - copy construction ( also known as * bcj * construction ) is used to construct a gravitational scattering amplitude by using modern unitarity method , and the scattering amplitudes of two gauge theory as building blocks @xcite .",
    "this pathbreaking technique of computing perturbative scattering amplitudes , which led to a deeper understanding of quantum field theory , gravity , and to powerful new tools for calculating qcd processes , was awarded the _",

    "* bcj * construction has overturned the long - accepted dogma on einstein s gr , which posits that gr is nonrenormalizable",
    ". this new approach breaths new life into the search for a fundamental unified theory of nature based on the `` supergravity '' approach .",
    "supergravity tries to tame the infinities encountered in the einstein s theory of gravity by adding `` supersymmetries '' to it . in a variant of the theory called @xmath20 supergravity , which has eight new `` mirror - image '' particles ( gravitinos )",
    "allow physicists to tame the infinities present in the einstein s theory of gravity : other variants of supergravity are @xmath21 yang - mills - einstein - supergravity ( ymesg ) and @xmath22 yang - mills - einstein ( yme ) theories ( @xcite , and the references therein ) @xmath1 supergravity is like a * `` young twig , which thrives and bears fruit only when it is grafted carefully and in accordance with strict horticultural rules upon the old stem''*.    as to the @xmath22 yme theory ( where @xmath22 means that there are no supersymmetries in the theory ) , we claim that this theory is by no means different from the broken - scale - invariant weyl s action .",
    "this assertion can only be true if this action naturally possesses bcj and guage - gravity duality properties .",
    "the bcj property is established in the next subsection , and we show that the potential , carried by the broken - scale - invariant weyl s action , possesses this property in the * subsection d * of * section iii * of this paper",
    ". the gauge - gravity duality property of strong gravity is established in * section viii * : this is our * `` guide post on the mazy paths to the hidden truths '' * of neutrino mass and dark energy problems .",
    "the discovery made here is that both problems are connected by the effective vacuum energy ( or effective weyl lagrangian ) .",
    "qcd ( one of the variants of yang - mills theory ) is the current well - established theory of the strong interactions . due to its asymptotic - free nature",
    ", perturbation theory is usually applied at short distances ; and the ensuing predictions have achieved an astonishing success in explaining a wide range of phenomena in the domain of large momentum transfers . upon closer consideration",
    "the question arises : can perturbation theory be used to explore the quantum behavior of gravity at short distances as well ?",
    "the answer to that question is a resounding yes ! the discovery of * bcj * principle is now our window into the quantum world of gravity with tamable infinities at short distances .",
    "this principle states that , regardless of the number of spacetime dimensions and loops , a valid gravity scattering amplitude is obtained by replacing color factors with kinematic numerators in a gauge - theory scattering amplitude . the resulting gauge - coupling doubling is called * bcj / double - copy * property @xcite .",
    "the gluon s scattering amplitudes , ( in terms of cubic graphs ) at l loops and in d dimensions , are given by ( @xcite , and the references therein):@xmath23    where @xmath24 is the number of points , @xmath25 is the dimensionless gauge coupling , @xmath26 are the standard symmetry factors and @xmath27 are denominators encoding the structure of propagator in the cubic graphs .",
    "@xmath28 are the color factors and @xmath29 are the kinematic numerators .",
    "bcj construction posits that within the gauge freedom of individual cubic graphs , there exist unique amplitude representations that make kinematic factors @xmath29 obey the same general algebraic identities as color factors .",
    "hence , color / kinematics duality holds : @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the double - copy principle then states that once the color / kinematics duality is satisfied ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) , the l - loop scattering amplitudes of a supergravity theory ( with @xmath31 ) are given by@xmath32    where dimensionless @xmath33 is the gravity coupling ; and it is assumed that the two involved gauge fields are from the same yang - mills theory . from eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we have@xmath34    eq.(3 ) , which is valid for all variants of supergravity with @xmath31 , is the expected gauge - coupling doubling or bcj property .",
    "this property shows that gravitons and gluons should be part of a fundamental unified theory of nature .    however , the devil is in the detail : the color - kinematics duality ( @xmath35 ) is more or less a conjecture ; and the scattering - amplitude method of probing the quantum nature of gravity is full of many mathematical _",
    "landmines_. nevertheless , the conclusions of n = 8 supergravity theory are indisputable . for",
    "we are convinced that the gauge - coupling doubling and gauge - gravity duality should exist in the correct theory of quantum gravity without appealing to supersymmetries .",
    "this is where strong gravity theory ( or point - like gravity ) kicks in .",
    "our present knowledge of the theory of strong gravity puts us in a position to _ attack successfully _ the problem of * quantum gravity / point - like gravity * by using powerful - mathematical tools ( _ formula operators from differential geometry with their duality and supersymmetry - like properties _ ) _ bequeathed _ to us by _",
    "we conclude this section with a great quote from one of the greatest revolutionary mathematicians the world has ever known ( _ david hilbert _ ) @xcite : `` if we do not succeed in solving a mathematical problem , the reason frequently consists in our failure to recognize the more general standpoint from which the problem before us appears only as a single link in a chain of related problems . after finding this standpoint ,",
    "not only is this problem frequently more accessible to our investigation , but at the same time we come into possession of a method which is applicable also to related problems '' @xmath1the * `` standpoint '' * discovered in this paper is the * strong gravity theory*.",
    "we briefly review the standard formulation of strong gravity theory in this section : ( for more details see @xcite and the references therein ) . beginning with the two - gluon phenomenological fields ( i.e. double - copy construction ) ,",
    "we re - establish strong gravity as a renormalizable four - dimensional quantum gauge field theory by varying _",
    "weyl action _ with respect to the spacetime metric constructed out of the two - gluon configuration . in this case",
    ", the two - point configuration ( which leads to the quantization of space - time itself ) naturally introduces a minimum length @xmath36 ( i.e. `` intergluonic distance '' ) ; where @xmath37 is the `` gluonic radius '' .",
    "it should be emphasized here that this way of quantizing space - time begins from the trajectories of _ two 2-gluons_,i.e . ,",
    "curves or paths of the geometry used .",
    "this method of constructing spacetime geometry from 2-gluon phenomenology has been shown to be compatible with nature : the visualization of the qcd vacuum ( i.e.*visualization of action density of the euclidean - space qcd vacuum in three - dimensional slices of a * @xmath38 * *  spacetime lattice * * ) , by d. b. leinweber , has shown that empty space is not empty ; rather it contains quantum fluctuations in the gluon field at all scales ( this is famously referred to as `` gluon activity in a vacuum '' ) @xcite .",
    "this can only mean one thing : that gluon field is the fundamental field of nature , and the spacetime metric / gravity is emergent from 2-gluon configuration .",
    "this is the main argument of bcj / double - copy construction . _",
    "simpliciter ! _    by taking the vacuum states of hadron to be colorless ( i.e. color - singlet ) , the approximation of an external qcd potential ( the hadron spectrum above these levels ) can be generated by color - singlet quanta .",
    "based on the fully relativistic qcd theory , these contributions have to come from the summations of suitable feynman diagrams in which dressed n - gluon configurations are exchanged between several `` flavors '' of massless quarks .",
    "thus , the simplest such system ( with contributions from n - gluon irreducible parts @xmath39 and with the same lorentz quantum numbers ) will have the quantum numbers of 2-gluon .",
    "the color singlet external field is then constructed from qcd gluon field as a sum ( @xcite , p.572):@xmath40    where @xmath41 is the @xmath42 color - metric , @xmath43 is the totally symmetric @xmath44 coefficient and @xmath45 is the dressed gluon field .",
    "the curvature would be generated by the derivatives of @xmath45 ( @xcite , p.323 ) .",
    "the 2-gluon configuration can then be written from eq.(4 ) as@xmath46    with @xmath47    eq.(5 ) is taken as the dominating configuration in the excitation systematics . in this picture , the metric is constructed from a gluon - gluon interaction , and the gluon - gluon effective gravity - like potential ( effective riemannian metric , @xmath48 ) would act as a metric field passively gauging the effective diffeomorphisms ( general coordinate transformations ) , just as is done by the einstein metric field for the general coordinate transformations of the covariance group ( @xcite , p.174 ) .",
    "it is crystal - clear that eq.(5 ) , as put forward by the proponents of strong gravity , is by no means different from the double - copy structure of gauge fields in the bcj construction ( @xmath49 ) ; as such we should be able to arrive at the same conclusions .",
    "the bcj formalism ( double - copy construction ) is formulated by using scattering - amplitude method .",
    "similarly , we show that double - copy construction can be obtained by using formula operators from the differential geometry .",
    "our approach puts bcj formalism on a proper mathematical footing : _ it puts flesh on the bones of bcj formalism .",

    "the fact that most of the calculations done using planck epoch parameters ( i.e. , planck time , planck energy and planck length ) conform to what is obtainable in nature strongly suggests that any epoch less than planck epoch is operationally meaningless .",
    "thus , a plausible theory can be constructed ( starting from the planck time @xmath647 ) by bringing the calculations done in the * *  section ix * * of this paper to bear : after about @xmath648  ( with planck length @xmath455 ) the repulsive gravity was @xmath649 this caused the universe to undergo an exponential expansion ( due to the exponential nature of @xmath643 ) .",
    "the exponential expansion lasted from @xmath648 after the big bang / bounce to time @xmath650 this is the time that produced the stable - flat curve ( red curve in the fig.(3 ) ) , signaling the demise of the exponential era .",
    "following this cosmic inflationary ( exponential expansion ) epoch , the dark matter @xmath1 which is nothing but the remnant of yang - mills - gravity force , @xmath651 @xmath1 dominates and the universe continues to expand but at a less rapid rate .",
    "the battle of supremacy between dark energy ( repulsive gravity ) and dark matter ( attractive gravity ) was won by dark energy during the time @xmath652 : since dark energy is intimately connected to the spacetime metric itself ( see eq.(189 ) ) , it would have increased tremendously during the exponential expansion period , when the space increased in size by factor of @xmath653 in a small fraction of a second !",
    "the victory of dark energy over dark matter means that our universe will continue to expand _ ad infinitum _ : _ we are living in a runaway universe .",
    "_    another formal way of explaining the inflationary epoch ( i.e. the vacuum - dominated universe approach ) of the universe @xmath1 which makes the pre - existing universe scenario conceivable @xmath1 can be effected by using *",
    "fig.3*. in this approach , it is believed that the universe passed through an early epoch of vacuum dominance ( i.e. inflation ) , presided over by the varying potential energy ( i.e. eq.(113 ) ) of the scalar field , called inflaton ( @xcite , p.564 ) .",
    "when the scalar field reached the minimum of the potential ( which corresponds to the minimum of the potential curve ( blue curve ) in the fig.3 ) exponential expansion ended .",
    "based on the law of conservation of energy , the reduction in the potential energy ( due to the rolling down of the inflaton from the top of the potential curve , i.e. the decaying of the inflaton field ) generated hot ( quark - gluon ) plasma epoch ( which later generated the matter and radiation epoch ) .",
    "so from then on , the big bang evolved according to the standard cosmological model ( @xcite , p.564 ) ; and governed by the eqs.(105 ) , ( 134 ) , ( 189 ) and ( 193 ) .",
    "we conclude this section with the following facts : ( 1 ) the initial conditions of our universe are the planck epoch parameters ( i.e. , planck time , planck energy and planck length ) .",
    "( 2 ) inflationary theory is correct . ( 3 ) the expansion epoch of the universe consists two phases : ( i ) the exponential expansion ( governed by @xmath654 ) and the normal accelerating expansion ( governed by eq.(189 ) ) .",
    "we have shown , in this paper , that the point - like theory of quantum gravity ( strong gravity theory ) is geometrically equivalent to the four - dimensional , nonlinear quantum gauge field theory ( i.e. qymt ) , and the einstein general relativity .",
    "the inherent uv regularity , bcj and gauge - gravity duality properties of this renormalizable theory allowed us to solve four of the most difficult problems in the history of physics : namely , dark matter , existence of quantum yang - mills theory on @xmath17 , neutrino mass and dark energy problems .    in any geometric field theory ,",
    "all physical quantities and fields should be induced from one geometric entity ( weyl s action ) and the building blocks of the geometry used ( 2-gluon configuration / double - copy construction ) .",
    "this principle has been inspired by einstein s statement @xmath1 `` a theory in which the gravitational field and electromagnetic field do not enter as logically distinct structures , would be much preferable''@xmath1 and established in this paper . as we have demonstrated",
    ", this principle implies that the weyl lagrangian density used to construct the field equations of the strong gravity theory is composed of the building blocks ( two gluons ) of the geometry and their derivatives ( in which the curvature arised in terms of derivatives of the dressed gluon field ) . in other words ,",
    "weyl lagrangian is not constructed , _ a priori _ , * from different parts * ( each corresponding to a certain field ) as usually done .",
    "this makes strong gravity theory to pass the test of unification principle .",
