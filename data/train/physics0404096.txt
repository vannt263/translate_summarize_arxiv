    "dusty ( or complex ) plasmas ( dp ) have been attracting an increasing interest among plasma physicists for more than a decade due to to the appearance of many novel phenomena .",
    "of particular importance is the possibility of the existence of new plasma configurations ( states ) , due to the strong intergrain coupling , including the spontaneous formation of crystal  like dp structures , when charged microparticles ( dust grains ) are trapped in the sheath region between the electrodes , in plasma discharge experiments @xcite .",
    "such crystals , which are generally horizontally arranged in a position of equilibrium which is levitated above the negative electrode in discharge experiments , have been shown to support longitudinal ( acoustic ) as well as transverse ( optic - like ) oscillation modes @xcite .",
    "force equilibrium in dp crystals is `` traditionally '' ensured by the sheath electric force which exactly balances gravity at the levitation height .",
    "crystalline complex plasma structures have been observed in recent rf discharge experiments @xcite in which the plasma sheath was embedded in an external magnetic field .",
    "gravity compensation was thus attributed to magnetic forces , thanks to the paramagnetic properties of the magnetized dust grains .",
    "theoretical studies then followed for the investigation of conditions for magnetic - field - assisted crystal equilibria involving paramagnetic charged dust grains .",
    "the role of various forces acting on paramagnetic grains has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where magnetic forces ( due to magnetic dipole interactions ) have been shown to prevail over the ( weaker ) electric polarization forces ( especially under experimental conditions considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where magnetic fields as strong as a few thousand gauss were used ) .",
    "according to these considerations , the properties of transverse magnetized dust lattice ( tmdl ) oscillations were investigated @xcite , where both isolated grain linear oscillatory modes and propagating linear waves were discussed .",
    "the dependence of the dynamics of ( linear ) grain oscillations on the specific characteristics of the ( inhomogeneous ) magnetic field was studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the possible occurrence of a linear instability depending on the field profile was pointed out .",
    "it is now established that the investigation of the linear regime of a dynamical system only unveils part of its dynamical profile .",
    "nonlinearity may be present in dp crystal dynamics , either due to intergrain interactions or due to the sheath environment . in a generic manner ,",
    "as the oscillation amplitude becomes large , nonlinearity is first manifested via the generation of wave harmonics leading to the amplitude modulation of the waves . increasing displacements even further",
    ", one may come up with the formation of localized structures ( solitons ) , which propagate and interact with each other in a remarkably stable manner , thanks to a compensation between nonlinearity and dispersion .",
    "the present study is devoted to an investigation of weakly nonlinear effects , with respect to magnetized transverse dust - lattice oscillations .",
    "nonlinearity is explicitly shown to be related to the magnetic and/or electric field profile , as well as to the intergrain electrostatic and/or magnetic ( dipole - dipole ) interactions . by using a perturbative approach ,",
    "the generation of phase harmonics is elucidated and exact expressions are obtained for the ( weak ) vertical displacement of the paramagnetic dust particles .",
    "once these oscillations propagate in the dusty crystal as a transverse wave , the amplitude is shown to be potentially unstable to external perturbations , under conditions which depend explicitly on the magnetic field characteristics .",
    "finally , the possible formation of localized envelope excitations is discussed , and the dependence of these coherent structure characteristics on the plasma parameters is pointed out .",
    "let us consider the vertical motion of a charged dust grain ( mass @xmath0 and charge @xmath1 ) , subject to an external static electric and magnetic field , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , both in the vertical ( @xmath4 ) direction .",

    "@xmath9 , in the @xmath10 direction , the force of gravity , and the usual ( epstein ) damping term , which involves the phenomenological damping rate @xmath11 due to dust  neutral collisions .",
    "we shall assume a smooth , continuous variation of the ( generally inhomogeneous ) field intensities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as well as the grain charge @xmath1 ( which may vary due to charging processes @xcite ) near the equilibrium position @xmath8 .",
    "thus , we may develop @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath15 and the subscript ` @xmath16 ' denotes evaluation at @xmath17 , viz .",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 and so forth .",
    "accordingly , the electric force @xmath20 and the magnetic force @xmath21 ( where the grain magnetic moment @xmath22 is related to the grain radius @xmath23 and permeability @xmath22 via @xmath24 @xcite ) , which are now expressed as @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath28 may be combined into @xmath29 where we have introduced the phenomenological potential @xmath30 @xmath31 the definitions of @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 ; the superscript @xmath34 denotes order in partial differentiation ) are obvious @xmath35 and so forth .",
    "note the force balance equation @xmath36 which is satisfied at equilibrium .",
    "given the above definitions , the equation of motion ( [ eqmotion1 ] ) takes the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 and higher order terms are omitted .",
    "one immediately notices the intrinsically nonlinear character of the transverse dust oscillations due to the electric / magnetic field inhomogeneity . in the linear limit ( @xmath39 for @xmath40 ) , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are exactly recovered .",
    "once the set of parameter values are determined , eq . ( [ eqmotion2 ] ) can be solved , e.g. via a lindstedt  poincar method . assuming small displacements of the form @xmath41 , where the reduced time variable @xmath42 incorporates a frequency shift due to nonlinearity : @xmath43 .",
    "one thus obtains the solution @xmath44 along with a nonlinear frequency shift @xmath45 .",
    "we see that the nonlinearity of the force acting on the paramagnetic dust grains typically results in the generation of frequency harmonics once the oscillation amplitude becomes slightly significant in magnitude .",
    "the occurrence of this effect depends on the relative magnitude of the coefficients @xmath46 and @xmath47 in eq .",
