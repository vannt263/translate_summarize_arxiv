    "<S> we introduce a general symmetrisation method that allows for direct experimental characterisation of relevant features of the noise . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this framework to develop an efficient experimental protocol for characterising multi - qubit correlations and memory effects in the noise . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , the estimated noise parameters are immediately relevant for optimizing experimental control methods . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this optimization through an implementation of the protocol on a solid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) qip .    </S>",

    "<S> a distance-@xmath6 code refers to class of codes that correct all errors simultaneously affecting up to @xmath7 qubits . </S>",

    "<S> markovian noise is guaranteed to satisfy the semi - group property @xmath57 and hence memory effects in the noise are implied by any observed deviations from the condition @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> the estimates @xmath53 also give estimates for @xmath48 , but the statistical uncertainty for @xmath48 grows exponentially with @xmath28 . using a bound on @xmath47 derived in the appendix , we show that all @xmath48 for which @xmath59 can be estimated with @xmath60 trials . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for characterisation of other important features of the noise . </S>",
    "<S> the probability @xmath61 is directly related to the entanglement fidelity of the channel and hence this protocol provides an exponential savings over recently proposed methods for estimating this single figure of merit @xcite ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . hence , by actually implementing any given code we can bound the failure probability of that code with only @xmath62 experiments without making any theoretical assumptions about the noise . </S>",

    "<S> this holds quite generally in the context of the symmetry considered above because the failure probability of a generic distance-@xmath65 code is bounded above by the total probability of error terms with pauli weight greater than @xmath7 and this weight remains invariant under conjugation by any element @xmath66 .    </S>",
    "<S> our method provides an efficient protocol for the characterisation of the noise in contexts where the target transformation is the identity operator , e.g. a quantum communication channel or quantum memory . </S>",
    "<S> however , the protocol also provides an efficient means for characterising the noise under the action of a non - identity unitary transformation such as a quantum gate . </S>",
    "<S> there are two ways to adapt the protocol to this setting . </S>",

    "<S> a second approach is to estimate the average error - per - gate for a sequence of @xmath56 gates such that the composition gives the identity operator . </S>",
    "<S> such a sequence can be generated by making use of the cyclic property @xmath69 of any gate in a universal gate set , or by choosing a sequence of @xmath70 random gates followed by an @xmath56th gate chosen such that the composition gives the identity transformation @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> let @xmath82 denote any subset of the group of permutations of @xmath0 qubits , @xmath83 , such that @xmath84 , where @xmath85 denotes each distribution of the @xmath40 @xmath44-pauli operators . as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figcirc ] , the symmetrisation consists of conjugating the process @xmath1 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 . let @xmath88 stand for the conjugated noise - map , then , given input operator @xmath89 , the output is @xmath90 . </S>",

    "<S> * results for experiments # 5 and # 6 in table [ tabresults ] . * shown are projections of the 4-dimensional likelihood function onto various probability planes . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry seen in some of the confidence areas is a result of this projection . </S>",

    "<S> the rate set by a pulse - spacing of 10@xmath94s leads to a poor overall fidelity for the time - suspension sequence , and , in particular , a significant probability of two - qubit errors from the residual terms in the effective hamiltonian . under two repetitions of the sequence with the pulse - spacing of 5@xmath94s ( which has twice as many pulses as the single sequence with the 10@xmath94s spacing ) , the probability of two - qubit errors in the residual terms decreases substantially . </S>",
    "<S> the overall fidelity of either pulse - sequence is still limited by incomplete heteronuclear decoupling of the qubits ( carbon nuclei ) from the environment ( nearby hydrogen nuclei ) : at the 5@xmath94s pulse - spacing the carbon nuclei are being modulated on a time - scale close to the proton decoupling frequency , so that the decoupling sequence no longer averages the heteronuclear coupling to zero . </S>",
    "<S> a simple extension of the protocol allows for determining which qubit accrues the greatest single qubit errors from this effect . </S>",
    "<S> the results were consistent with identifying the primary source of single - qubit errors as the qubit whose coupling to the hydrogen is an order of magnitude larger than that of the other two . by increasing the decoupling power we were able to reduce these errors though they could not be removed completely due to hardware limitations . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate an implementation of the above protocol on both a 2-qubit ( chloroform chcl@xmath95 ) liquid - state and a 3-qubit ( single - crystal malonic acid c@xmath95h@xmath96o@xmath96 ) solid - state nmr qip ( see the appendix for more information on methods ) . the results of six sets of experiments are summarized in table [ tabresults ] , and detailed results for one liquid - state set are shown in fig .

    "<S> the first four sets of experiments were performed under engineered noise to both characterize the performance of the protocol and to confirm high - fidelity control . </S>",
    "<S> two final two sets of experiments were performed in the solid - state to characterize the unknown residual noise occurring under ( a ) one cycle of a c48 pulse sequence @xcite with 10@xmath72 pulse spacing , and ( b ) two cycles of c48 with 5@xmath72 pulse spacing . </S>",
    "<S> the c48 sequence is designed to suppress the dynamics due to the system s internal hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the system under this pulse sequence can be evaluated theoretically by calculating the magnus expansion @xcite of the associated effective hamiltonian , under which the residual effects appear as a sum of terms associated with the zeeman and dipolar parts of the hamiltonian , including cross terms . </S>",
    "<S> roughly speaking , effective suppression of the @xmath97 term of the hamiltonian takes places when @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the strength of the term and @xmath100 is the rate at which it is modulated by the pulse sequence . </S>",
    "<S> generally shorter delays lead to improved performance unless there is a competing process at the shorter time - scale or there are limitations due to pulse imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> hence the performance of the pulse sequence is best evaluated via experimental characterisation . </S>",
    "<S> the results shown in table [ tabresults ] and fig . [ figssresults ] illustrate how the protocol can compare the performance of the two multiple - pulse time - suspension sequences both in terms of the overall fidelity and in terms of the relative probability of one , two and three body noise terms .    </S>",
    "<S> the method above is an illustration of the first step in a hierarchy of tests that are available under the general approach , with each test giving more fine - grained information . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a variation of the protocol in which only a pauli - twirl is applied enables a estimation of the @xmath101 relative probabilities of pauli @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath44 errors </S>",
    "<S> . this more fine - grained information is useful not only for optimisation over qecc in eventual applications , but also to characterize current performance of a given experimental set - up . </S>",
    "<S> the full scope of information that can be estimated efficiently via this general symmetrisation approach is an important topic for further research . </S>",
    "<S> a specific question in this direction is to determine whether this approach might enable efficient detection of the presence of noiseless subsystems . </S>"
