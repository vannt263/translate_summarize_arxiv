    "bennett :  entanglement is monogamous `` ( cf . @xcite ) .",
    "this is maybe one of the main characteristics of entanglement and it clearly distinguishes entanglement from classical correlations . the present paper is devoted to investigate this ' ' monogamy property  of entanglement in symmetric multipartite systems with the particular focus on the relation to frustration , the existence of local hidden variable models and to ground states of hamiltonians having the considered symmetry .",
    "the article is based on a talk given at the qit - eqis workshop in kyoto 2003 and it essentially reviews and extends results from @xcite and @xcite .    in order to understand a characteristic feature of entanglement it is useful to study the counterpart in classical correlations first  this will clarify the difference between the quantum and the classical world . to this end sec.[secbell ] will as a starting point discuss frustration in classical systems and their relation to bell inequalities . in sec.[secextensions",
    "] we will then utilize these observations in order to prove in a simple way that there exists a local hidden variable model for quantum states having symmetric extensions .",
    "sec.[secenergy ] considers more general symmetries and investigates the relation between the problem of maximizing the entanglement between nearest neighbors under a global symmetry constraint ( e.g. translational symmetry ) and the task of calculating ground state energies of certain nearest neighbor interaction hamiltonians .",
    "finally , sec.[secgauss ] will apply the ideas of the preceding section to gaussian systems with symmetries characterized by symmetric graphs .",
    "constraints on the possible range of correlations in the form of inequalities have been investigated for many years , even before physicists developed an interest in that subject due to the work of bell @xcite ( see the monograph by frchet @xcite ) .",
    "the relation between bell inequalities and frustration in classical systems was then pointed out and studied in the early eighties in particular by fine @xcite .    in spite of the simplicity of this connection",
    "there are , however , surprisingly many publications in the field of quantum information theory in which this knowledge has apparently disappeared .",
    "the following section will recall the relations between joint distributions , local hidden variable models , frustration and bell inequalities .",
    "let us consider a set of observables @xmath0 described within classical probability theory and let us denote the probability that observable @xmath1 leads to the outcome @xmath2 by @xmath3 .",
    "obviously , there exists always a _ joint probability distribution _",
    "@xmath4 which returns all the single distributions as marginals . however , if we fix in addition the pair distributions @xmath5 for a certain subset of pairs @xmath6 in a non - trivial way , a joint distribution with these marginals in general no longer exists .",
    "a necessary condition for the existence of @xmath7 is of course the _ compatibility _ of overlapping distributions in the sense that @xmath8 however , it is in general not sufficient , and the standard counter - example is a set of three observables with three pair distributions corresponding to total anti - correlations .",
    "it is very useful to depict the problem graphically and to assign a vertex to every observable and an edge to each of the fixed pair distributions . in this picture ,",
    "compatibility of the pair distributions is sufficient for the existence of a joint distribution @xmath7 if the graph does not contain any loops :    [ proploops ] consider a graph , such that every vertex @xmath9 corresponds to one of @xmath10 observables @xmath11 and every edge @xmath12 corresponds to a given pair distribution @xmath13 .",
    "if all overlapping distributions are compatible in the sense of eq.([eqcompatibility ] ) and the graph does not contain any loop , then there exists a joint probability distribution @xmath7 which returns all the given distributions as marginals .",
    "* proof : * the proof can easily be formulated in terms of an induction .",
    "assume there exists already a joint distribution @xmath14 which is compatible with all fixed pair distributions @xmath13 where @xmath15 and has the same marginal @xmath16 as all given pair distributions @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "then we can construct a new distribution @xmath19which has all the required properties for a set of @xmath20 vertices .",
    "since each step in the induction adds one edge and one vertex to the graph corresponding to the previous step , the construction only works for tree graphs , i.e. , graphs without loops  otherwise one would at some point have to add an edge without adding a new vertex .    the final joint distribution is then given by @xmath21\\cdot\\left[\\prod_j p^{(1-e_j)}_{x_j}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the number of edges at the @xmath23th vertex and the products have to be taken over all edges @xmath12 and vertices @xmath23 respectively , @xmath24 and joint probability @xmath25 . in this case",
    "we could as well take @xmath26 where @xmath27 is any function fulfilling @xmath28 and @xmath29 . ] .",
    "[ proploops ] shows that classically frustration is due to loops .",
    "this is in contrast to quantum mechanical systems , which can be frustrated even without loops .",
    "if the graph characterizing the fixed correlations between pairs of observables is _ _ two - colorable _ _ like in fig.[figgraphs1](c ) then a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a joint distribution is given by the complete set of bell inequalities , i.e. , by the existence of a local hidden variable model . in this sense",
    "the correlations of a quantum state which violates a bell inequality lead to unresolvable frustration when described within classical probability theory .",
    "let us briefly recall the above mentioned result .",
    "we say that a set of measured correlations @xmath30 between observables @xmath31 and @xmath32 admit a description within a local hidden variable model @xcite , if we can write @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the _",
    "hidden variable _ and the source of the correlation experiment is characterized by the probabilities with which the different @xmath35 occur , i.e. , by a probability measure @xmath36 on @xmath37 .",
    "the _ response function _ @xmath38 gives the probability that measuring the system in state @xmath35 with observable @xmath39 leads to the outcome @xmath40 .",
    "the locality assumption in eq.([lhiv2prob ] ) is expressed in the fact that the response functions factorize , such that @xmath38 does not depend on @xmath41 and @xmath42 is independent of @xmath39 .",
    "the local hidden variable description of a set of correlations is equivalent to the existence of a joint probability distribution @xcite :    [ propbelljoint ] there exists a joint probability distribution for all given pair distributions @xmath30 if and only if the correlations admit a description within a local hidden variable model .    *",
    "proof : * let @xmath43 , @xmath44 be vectors of observables and their respective outcomes , and similarly for @xmath45 . if @xmath46 is the joint distribution for all pair distributions @xmath47 , then @xmath48is an admissible ( deterministic ) local hidden variable model with @xmath49 playing the role of the measure @xmath36 and the two delta functions corresponding to the characteristic functions in eq.([lhiv2prob ] ) .",
    "conversely , if @xmath50 , @xmath36 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 are probability space , measure and response functions for a local hidden variable model , then @xmath53 is a joint distribution , which returns all pair distributions @xmath54 as marginals .",
    "note that prop.[propbelljoint ] naturally generalizes to @xmath10-partite systems , where correlations of the form @xmath55 instead of pair distributions are given .",
    "as already mentioned frustration in quantum systems are possible even without loops in the configuration .",
    "the simplest example is a system of three qubits distributed to alice , bob and charlie , where alice wants to be maximally entangled with both her colleagues .",
    "clearly , this is not possible and one way to see this is to realize that in such a scenario alice could teleport an unknown qubit perfectly to both , bob and charlie , which contradicts the no - cloning theorem@xcite .",
    "in fact , if alice is maximally entangled with bob she can not share _ any _ correlations with charlie , neither entanglement nor classical correlations and it has recently been proven that there is even a quantitative trade - off between the amount of entanglement alice shares with bob and the maximal amount of classical correlations shared with charlie @xcite .",
    "we will in the following restrict to symmetric situations , where we have for instance alice being surrounded by several bobs and charlies in a symmetric manner . using the observations of the previous section",
    ", we can easily recover results of @xcite and @xcite :    [ propbellext ] let @xmath56 be a density matrix acting on a hilbert space @xmath57 such that all bipartite reduced states of the form @xmath58 are equal . then the state @xmath59 admits a local hidden variable model with respect to all correlations between @xmath60 observables on site @xmath61 and an arbitrary number of observables measured on site @xmath62 .",
    "* proof : * let @xmath63 , @xmath64 be the povm operators corresponding to the measurement devices @xmath39 and @xmath41 with respective measurement outcomes @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath67}\\ ] ] is an admissible joint probability distribution compatible with all pair distributions @xmath68}$ ] . by applying prop.[proploops ] and prop.[propbelljoint ]",
    "we have then that there exists a local hidden variable model for all correlations of an arbitrary number of observables acting on @xmath62 and @xmath60 measurement devices for @xmath61 .",
    "[ propbellext ] shows that if the number @xmath60 of equal neighbors in a quantum system is increased , then the bipartite correlations between the central particle and one of the neighbors become more and more classical .",
    "in fact , is was conjectured by schumacher and proven by werner ( cf.@xcite ) that if @xmath60 tends to infinity , then @xmath69 can not contain any entanglement  this is the only possibility of having a starlike extension with arbitrary many parties .",
    "the following result generalizes prop.[propbellext ] to cases in which local hidden variable models for more than two parties can be constructed :    [ propbellextmulti ] let @xmath56 acting on @xmath70 be a density operator characterizing a state of @xmath71 particles with permutation symmetry within each of @xmath72 disjoint sets of @xmath60 particles ( see fig.[figlayers ] ) .",
    "take the @xmath10-partite reduced state @xmath73 which contains one particle of each set plus the remaining particle .",
    "then @xmath73 admits a local hidden variable description for all correlations of an arbitrary number of observables on the @xmath10th `` single particle '' site and @xmath60 observables on each of the remaining @xmath72 sites .",
    "* proof : * let @xmath74 be the povm corresponding to the @xmath23th observable on site @xmath75 with respective outcome @xmath76 . then @xmath77}\\ ] ] is an admissible joint distribution for one observable ( @xmath23 ) on the @xmath10th site and @xmath60 observables on the remaining @xmath72 sites .",
    "having the tensor factors properly ordered , this distribution is compatible with all correlations measured on @xmath73 .",
    "this is seen by noting that taking the sum over @xmath78 in eq.([manytensors ] ) corresponds to tracing out the @xmath9th particle in the @xmath75th set ( `` layer '' in fig.[figlayers ] ) . due to the assumed permutation symmetry of @xmath56 it does , however ,",
    "not matter which @xmath79 particles in each layer are traced out  we will always end up with the @xmath10-partite reduced state @xmath73 .    by prop.[proploops ] the probability distribution in eq.([manytensors ] ) can be extended to a joint distribution including an arbitrary number of observables on the @xmath10th site and by the multipartite generalization of prop.[propbelljoint ] there exists a local hidden variable model for all the considered correlations . can be weakened in two directions : first , permutation symmetry within each layer is not required  it is sufficient that all possible @xmath10-partite reduced states are equal to @xmath73 .",
    "second , as mentioned in ref.@xcite , positivity of @xmath56 is only required on product operators . moreover",
    ", the numbers of particles per layer may be different . ]",
    "prop . [ propbellext ] and prop .",
    "[ propbellextmulti ] show that an increasing symmetry of a quantum state ( in the sense of an increasing number of equal neighbors ) constrains the entanglement in such a way that violating bell inequalities of a certain type is no longer possible . in the following",
    "we will consider multipartite quantum systems which have more general symmetries with respect to the ordering of the particles and investigate quantitatively how this global symmetry constraints the entanglement between two neighboring particles .",
    "the considered symmetry group will always be a subgroup @xmath80 of the group @xmath81 of all permutations of @xmath10 parties .",
    "the global density operator @xmath56 then commutes with all group elements is represented by unitary operators @xmath82 which permute the tensor factors of the total hilbert space @xmath83 . ] and it is in particular invariant under the group averaging @xmath84 it is in many cases again advantageous to depict the problem graphically and to assume that the group @xmath80 is the symmetry group of a graph whose vertices correspond to particles , i.e. , tensor factors of the total hilbert space . for simplicity we will only consider _ edge transitive graphs _ here .",
    "this provides a natural notion of `` neighboring '' particles , namely those corresponding to adjacent vertices in the graph , and we will not have to specify which neighbors we are considering since they are all equal .",
    "prominent examples of edge transitive graphs are stars , rings , cubic , hexagonal and trigonal lattices , permutational invariant clusters and the platonic solids .",
    "typically , states with these symmetries appear as ground states ( or equilibrium states ) of particles on a lattice with equal nearest neighbor interaction along the edges of the considered graph .",
    "we will show that the state which has the largest nearest neighbor entanglement under such a symmetry constraint is always the ground state of a certain nearest neighbor interaction hamiltonian and that , moreover , the maximal achievable amount of entanglement is a function of the ground state energy .",
    "this statement is rather obvious if we quantify the entanglement using a linear functional like the the overlap @xmath85 with the singlet state @xmath86 of two qubits .",
    "in fact , in this case the maximum is always achieved for the ground state of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg hamiltonian , since we can write @xmath87.\\ ] ] in this way we can for instance relate the ground state energy density of the infinite antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin-@xmath88 chain to the maximal achievable singlet fraction of a state with infinite translation symmetry , which is then given by @xmath89 .    however , an analogous statement is still true if we measure the entanglement in terms of a highly nonlinear functional , the _ _ entanglement of formation__@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the singlet fraction the entanglement of formation is a proper _ entanglement measure _ and it is closely related to the amount of pure state entanglement needed to prepare a state by means of local operations and classical communication .",
    "it is defined as @xmath90 where @xmath91\\big)$ ] is the pure state entanglement of @xmath92 given by the von neumann entropy @xmath93 of the reduced state . due to the fact that eq.([eqeofdef ] )",
    "is a so - called _ convex hull _ construction , we can prove the following :    [ prophvsef ] consider the set @xmath94 of multipartite quantum states with ( permutation ) symmetry group @xmath80 of an edge transitive graph .",
    "the maximal entanglement @xmath95 between two neighboring particles of a state @xmath96 is attained for the ground state projector of a nearest neighbor interaction hamiltonian with interactions along the edges of the considered graph .",
    "the maximal achievable entanglement is then a function of the ground state energy .",
    "* proof : * first note that by the concavity of the entropy we can take the infimum in eq.([eqeofdef ] ) over all decompositions of @xmath69 into mixed states @xmath97 as well .",
    "moreover , @xmath98 is by construction the convex hull of the functional @xmath99\\big)$ ] , which can equivalently be expressed as the supremum over all affine functions , which lie below it ( cf.@xcite ) . that is @xmath100\\big)\\big|\\sum_i p_i\\sigma_i=\\rho\\right\\}\\\\ & = & \\sup_h\\left\\{{{\\rm tr}\\left[\\rho_{ab}h\\right]}\\big|\\forall\\sigma : { { \\rm tr}\\left[\\sigma h\\right]}\\leq s\\big({\\rm tr}_a[\\sigma]\\big)\\right\\}\\\\ & = & -\\inf_h \\left\\{{{\\rm tr}\\left[\\rho_{ab}h\\right]}\\big|\\forall\\sigma : { { \\rm tr}\\left[\\sigma",

    "there are two drawbacks concerning the application of prop.[prophvsef ] .",
    "first of all , the parametrization of @xmath101 is in general not known explicitly .",
    "in fact , there are only very few systems for which we are able to calculate @xmath95 .",
    "besides highly symmetric one - parameter families of states @xcite this is at present only feasible for systems of two qubits @xcite and symmetric two - mode gaussian states @xcite .",
    "the second problem is the calculation of the ground state energy @xmath107 for large systems .",
    "though some particular two - qubit interactions lead to exactly solvable models in one dimension , the set of these models is apparently not large enough in order to answer the question about the maximal possible @xmath95 for an infinite qubit chain in a straight forward manner . using results from ref.@xcite",

    "this leads to a somehow deformed xxz + z - field model which is , unfortunately , not exactly solvable .",
    "however , for hamiltonians which are quadratic in bosonic operators , i.e. , interactions with gaussian ground states , both problems  calculating @xmath98 ( that is parameterizing @xmath101 ) and calculating @xmath107are feasible .",
