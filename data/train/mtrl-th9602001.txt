    "the study of liquid binary alloys has been an extremely fruitful source of insights into the relations between structure and electronic properties in condensed matter .",
    "there has been a vast amount of experimental work on metallic and semiconducting binary liquids , and it has been well known for many years that their properties often vary dramatically with composition@xcite .",
    "famous cases are the cs - au and mg - bi alloys@xcite , in which the pure elements are good metals , but nevertheless the stoichiometric mixtures ( csau and mg@xmath9bi@xmath4 ) have very low conductivities , and their structures are characteristic of molten salts .",
    "these effects arise from the electronegativity difference between the elements , and the resulting charge transfer , partial ionicity and heterocoordination . in systems where one of the elements is a semiconductor in the liquid state  for example alloys of metals with s or se ",
    "even richer behavior can be expected , since variation of composition should change the bonding from metallic through partially ionic to covalent .",
    "we report here a set of simulations of the liquid ag - se system performed using _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) , which we have used to explore these effects .",
    "the electrical conductivity @xmath8 of the ag@xmath0se@xmath1 system has been measured over most of the composition range at temperatures from 973 to 1573  k@xcite . as the composition goes from pure @xmath5-ag to the stoichiometric alloy ag@xmath4se",
    ", @xmath8 decreases from the typically metallic value of @xmath10  50000  @xmath11@xmath12 to typical semiconducting values of @xmath10  500  @xmath11@xmath12 .",
    "this strongly suggests the formation of a pseudogap in the electronic density of states at the stoichiometric composition , with the fermi energy lying in this gap . as the se content",
    "is further increased , @xmath8 varies rather little over the range between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and then descends to very low values of @xmath10  1  @xmath11@xmath12 at 700  k as the ag content goes to zero@xcite .",
    "the properties of pure @xmath5-se have been very extensively studied@xcite , and it is known to have a gap of _ ca . _  1.9  ev in the density of states just above its melting point ( @xmath10490  k ) ,",
    "so that it is a wide - gap semiconductor . this gap decreases with increasing temperature , and appears to be _ ca . _  0.7  ev at 1350  k and 100  bar  @xcite .",
    "pure @xmath5-ag has the rather closed - packed structure and high coordination number ( _ ca . _  12 )",
    "expected from its f.c.c .",
    "crystal structure@xcite . until very recently ,",
    "the structure of @xmath5-ag@xmath4se had been measured only at the level of the neutron - weighted structure factor@xcite , but neutron diffraction combined with isotope variation has now been used to measure the partial structure factors and hence the partial radial distribution functions@xcite .",
    "these reveal the heterocoordination characteristic of ionic or partially ionic liquids , as will be discussed more fully below .",
    "diffraction studies on @xmath5-se have been made by several independent groups@xcite , and it is well established that the average coordination of the atoms is close to 2.0 over a wide range of temperatures and pressures from the melting point up to 1773  k and 815  bar .",
    "it is widely believed that this coordination indicates the presence of extended chain - like structures , and there is support for this from simulation work@xcite .",
    "these facts imply that there must be major changes of atomic ordering as the composition is varied from pure @xmath5-ag to pure @xmath5-se .",
    "however , nothing is yet known about the structure of the alloys except at the stoichiometric composition .",
    "the aim of the work reported here is to use _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulation ( aimd ) @xcite to investigate the structure , the atomic dynamics and the electronic structure of the liquid ag - se alloys at different compositions .",
    "the issues we want to address are : the relationship between the electronic structure of the liquid and the solid ; the characteristics of the electronic density of states and electron distribution as a function of composition ; the variation of liquid structure with composition , and particularly how the apparently ionic structure of @xmath5-ag - se goes over to the chain - like structure of @xmath5-se ; and the way this liquid structure is related to the dynamics of the ions . at present",
    ", there is almost no experimental information about any of these questions . of course",
    ", before we address any of these issues , we have to show that our aimd techniques are able to give a faithful representation of the real material .",
    "because of this , we will begin by presenting calculations on the @xmath3-ag@xmath4se crystal , which has a rather complex structure and gives a good test of our methods .",
    "our study of the crystal also provides an essential reference point for discussing the properties of the liquid .",
    "aimd is ideally suited to this type of problem .",
    "the energetics of the system and the forces on the ions are calculated by first - principles quantum methods , with no adjustable parameters , and without the need for the empirical interionic potentials used in earlier simulations on many liquid mixtures , including @xmath5-ag@xmath4se @xcite .",
    "in addition , the thermal - equilibrium structure , atomic dynamics and electronic structure are all calculated together in a completely unified and self - consistent way .",
    "aimd techniques have been used to investigate a number of other liquid metals and semiconductors , including the binary alloys k - si@xcite , na - sn@xcite , cs - pb@xcite and ga - se@xcite .",
    "preliminary results of the work presented here have already been published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we summarize the simulation techniques , and we then present in sec .",
    "iii our calculations on the equilibrium structure and the electronic structure of @xmath3-ag@xmath4se .",
    "our simulation results on the liquid ag - se alloys are reported in sec .",
    "iv , where we examine successively the structure , the atomic dynamics and the electronic properties , including the density of states and the electronic conductivity .",
    "we present a brief , discussion of the relation between atomic ordering and electronic properties in sec .",
    "v , and our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "our _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) technique is closely related to the car - parrinello approach @xcite .",
    "we use density functional theory within the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite .",
    "only the valence electrons are treated explicitly , the interaction of the valence electrons with the atomic cores being represented by norm - conserving non - local pseudopotentials@xcite .",
    "the simulations are performed in a periodically repeated cell with the wave functions expanded in plane waves .",
    "the basis set includes all plane waves whose kinetic energy is less than a chosen cut - off energy @xmath15 .",
    "an important difference between our calculations and the original car - parrinello approach is that instead of treating the electronic degrees of freedom by ` fake dynamics ' we relax the electrons to the born - oppenheimer surface for every ionic configuration , using conjugate - gradients minimization @xcite . as in the original scheme",
    ", we calculate the forces acting on the ions via the hellmann - feynman theorem , and these are then used to integrate the classical equation of motion of the ions .",
    "it is computationally more expensive to bring the electrons to the born - oppenheimer surface than to do one step in the car - parrinello method , but the extra cost is compensated by the fact that we can use a larger molecular dynamics time step . to handle the semi - metallic nature of the system , we use fermi - surface smearing , with the electronic occupation numbers treated as auxiliary dynamical variables @xcite .",
    "a detailed report on how this is done in practice has been presented in our work on @xmath5-ga@xcite .",
    "although aimd has become a standard technique , very few simulations have been reported on systems containing transition or post - transition metals @xcite .",
    "because of the important role of the @xmath16-electrons , it is essential to include them explicitly , and this brings two kinds of problems .",
    "firstly , the number of occupied orbitals is substantially increased .",
    "secondly , the compact nature of the @xmath16-orbitals means that a large cutoff @xmath15 is needed , and this implies a large plane - wave basis set .",
    "our aimd simulations on the ag - se system were performed with a version of the cetep code@xcite running on a cray t3d parallel supercomputer .",
    "we note that the version of the code used here reaches the ground state by minimizing with respect to all bands simultaneously , rather than by the band - by - band method of earlier versions . in the liquid simulations",
    ", we needed about 12 minimization steps for every ionic configuration to converge the total free energy within 10@xmath17  ev / atom .",
    "technical details of our _ ab initio _ pseudopotentials are as follows .",
    "the ag pseudopotential has been optimised using the method of lin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which is a refinement of the scheme due to rappe _",
    "the se pseudopotential does not require optimisation and the standard kerker method @xcite suffices . for ag ,",
    "all states below @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are treated as core states .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 components of the ag pseudopotential were generated using the atomic configuration 4@xmath235@xmath245@xmath25 , and the @xmath16 component using the configuration 4@xmath235@xmath26 .",
    "the core radii were 2.0 , 2.0 and 2.5 a.u .",
    "for the @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath16 components respectively . for se , we used 4@xmath274@xmath28 for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 waves and 4@xmath274@xmath294@xmath30 for the @xmath16 wave ; the core radii were chosen to be 2.0 , 2.0 , and 2.3 a.u . for the @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath16 components respectively .",
    "we work with the pseudopotentials in kleinman - bylander separable form@xcite , with the @xmath21-wave treated as local ; the non - local parts of the pseudopotentials are treated in real space @xcite .",
    "we use a plane - wave cut - off of 400  ev . as a preliminary test of our pseudopotentials",
    ", we have performed calculations on the low temperature phase @xmath3-ag@xmath4se , which we present in more detail in the next section .",
    "we also tested the pseudopotentials in our work on agcl@xcite and the liquid ga - se alloy@xcite .",
    "at atmospheric pressure silver selenide , ag@xmath4se , exists in two polymorphic forms .",
    "the high temperature form , @xmath32-ag@xmath4se , is stable above 406  k. the structure is b.c.c .",
    "with spacing @xmath33   , and the unit cell contains two ag@xmath4se units .",
    "the se atoms form a stable b.c.c lattice , while the ag atoms are statistically distributed among several interstitial sites@xcite . in this structure ,",
    "all the ag atoms are mobile , and in fact @xmath3-ag@xmath4se is a typical superionic conductor similar to @xmath3-agi and @xmath3-ag@xmath4s @xcite .",
    "( 85,100)(0,0 )    ag@xmath4se transforms from the @xmath32 phase to a low temperature form , @xmath3-ag@xmath4se , at 406  k. the structure of @xmath3-ag@xmath4se has been resolved by x - ray powder diffraction as orthorhombic with cell constants @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36   .",
    "the space group is p2@xmath372@xmath372@xmath37 and there are four ag@xmath4se units in the unit cell@xcite .",
    "a three dimensional representation of the structure is shown is in fig .",
    "[ fig : solid ] .",
    "the four se atoms are equivalent by symmetry , and they almost lie on two planes perpendicular to the @xmath38 axis .",
    "there are two inequivalent ag sites .",
    "the first type , ag@xmath39 , lie just above or below the planes of the chalcogen atoms .",
    "these atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated by se atoms , three in the nearest se plane and one in the next , at distance 2.62 , 2.79 , 2.86 and 2.71   , respectively .",
    "the other silver atoms , ag@xmath40 , lie almost halfway between the planes of chalcogen atoms .",
    "the arrangement of the se around the ag@xmath40 atoms is almost triangular , at distances 2.72 , 2.74 and 2.81   , with two second neighbors at 3.28 and 3.50   .",
    "each se atom is surrounded by seven ag atoms , or nine if the second neighbors are taken into account .",
    "silver is well known to exist in various solid - state compounds with coordination numbers ranging from 2 up to 8@xcite .",
    "examples of coordination 2 , 3 , and 4 are given by ag@xmath4o@xcite , ag@xmath9ass@xmath9@xcite and agi@xcite . in this respect the binary compounds of silver with the chalcogen elements , ag@xmath4x ( x = o , s , se and te ) , are remarkable since the coordination of silver varies from linear to trigonal bipyramidal when going down the via column@xcite . with a valence of one for silver these compounds may be regarded as ionic which makes these low coordinations all the more striking , since ionic bonds usually imply higher coordination .",
    "the stability of the ag @xmath23 ion in such compounds may be attributed to the mixing of the silver @xmath16 and @xmath21 states which occurs when the atom is placed in a low - symmetry environment@xcite .",
    "the electronic properties of @xmath3-ag@xmath4se are those of a semiconductor with a small energy gap .",
    "the exact value of the energy gap , is however controversial , and values ranging from 0.02 to 0.22  ev have been published@xcite .",
    "0.0 [ tab : solid ]    .comparison of calculated and experimental crystallographic parameters for ( experimental values in parentheses ) .",
    "the lattice constants are given in   .",
    "the internal parameters @xmath7 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the coordinates of the atoms in units of @xmath43 , @xmath38 and @xmath6 .",
    "the three other positions equivalent by symmetry are given by ( @xmath44+@xmath7,@xmath45,@xmath46 ) , ( @xmath47,@xmath48,@xmath44+@xmath42 ) and ( @xmath49,@xmath44+@xmath41,@xmath50 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : conduc ]    the conductivity @xmath51@xmath12 found at stoichiometry is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data .",
    "however , as @xmath7 increases , the calculated @xmath8 first increases dramatically to @xmath101500 @xmath11@xmath12 at @xmath52 and then decreases slightly to @xmath10  1250 @xmath11@xmath12 at @xmath14 .",
    "these values are 3 - 4 times higher than the experimental values . for pure @xmath5-se",
    "the calculated @xmath8 is too large by at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "we believe that these large discrepancies with experiment arise from the approximations implicit in the kubo - greenwood approach .",
    "there are two major deficiencies in the kubo - greenwood formula as applied here .",
    "first , it completely ignores electron - electron collisions , and includes only the effect of scattering of the electrons by the ions .",
    "second , and much more serious , it works with the kohn - sham energies , rather than with quasi - particle energies . for metallic systems having free - electron - like dos ,",
    "the errors are probably small , and in cases like @xmath5-si @xcite and @xmath5-ga@xcite the method has been shown to work well .",
    "but in systems having a pseudogap , like the liquid alloys considered here , the use of the ( artificial ) kohn - sham energies is very likely to cause serious errors .",
    "the case of pure @xmath5-se is particularly instructive , since experimentally there is a band - gap of @xmath100.7 ev @xcite under the conditions of interest , whereas our aimd simulations show no gap , but only a deep minimum in the dos .",
    "it is important to be clear that this does not point to any error in the dft calculations as far as liquid structure and dynamics are concerned .",
    "what is at issue here is the ( unsurprising ) consequence of trying to use kohn - sham energies in an unjustified way .",
    "similar large overestimates of the electronic conductivity have been reported in recent aimd simulations on @xmath5-mg@xmath9bi@xmath4@xcite .",
    "however , it is not yet clear under what circumstances one should expect these large errors , and it is worth noting that the conductivity calculated in our very recent aimd simulations on the @xmath5-ga - se system@xcite agreed quite well with experiment in spite of their low values and the existence of a deep pseudogap .",
    "we have remarked in a number of places on the ionic nature of the solid and liquid ag - se system , and the implications of this for understanding the structure .",
    "we now try to bring these remarks together into a coherent picture .",
    "the ionic nature of solid @xmath3-ag@xmath4se is clear from an analysis of the dos , and we have seen that the electronic structure changes little an melting , so that @xmath5-ag@xmath4se can be regarded as consisting approximatively of ag@xmath53 and se@xmath54 ions . in the more se - rich liquid",
    "we have used the dos and ldos to argue that isolated se ions are in the se@xmath54 state , while the chains consist of neutral se atoms terminated by se@xmath55 dangling bonds .",
    "this means that the hyperstoichiometric liquid consists of ag@xmath53 , se@xmath54 and ( se@xmath56)@xmath54 complexes .",
    "this picture can be tested by using simple charge - balance arguments to predict the average number of se - se bonds in the liquid at any composition , and hence the coordination number of the short distance peak in @xmath57 .",
    "if the system consisted entirely of ag@xmath53 and se@xmath54 ions , the net charge on a system of @xmath58 and @xmath59 ions would be @xmath60 .",
    "if the clusters are all ( se@xmath56)@xmath54 then the formation of every se - se bond reduces the charge by two units . for electroneutrality ,",
    "the number of bonds must therefore be @xmath61 , and the coordination number of the short distance peak in @xmath57 must be @xmath62 .",
    "this formula gives predicted values of 0 , 0.62 and 1.46 for the se - se coordination number at the compositions @xmath13 , 0.42 and 0.65 , which are quiet close to the values 0.1 , 0.6 and 1.5 that we reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : coord ] .",
    "this agreement confirms the picture we propose .",
    "we can interpret the composition dependence of the experimental electrical conductivity in the light of this picture .",
    "for pure @xmath5-ag , the dos is expected to be rather free - electron - like near @xmath63 .",
    "as se is added , electrons are drained from the ag(5@xmath64 ) band into the se(4@xmath22 ) states until , at the stoichiometric composition , @xmath63 is in a pseudogap at the top of the se(4@xmath22 ) band .",
    "if the dos remained rigid beyond this point , @xmath63 would move into a region of higher dos , and @xmath8 would increase strongly . instead of this , se - se bonding starts to occur , and this creates a pseudogap between se non - bonding and antibonding states .",
    "it is this that maintains @xmath8 at low values .",
    "finally , as pure @xmath5-se is approached , this pseudogap widens , and @xmath8 falls to even lower values . as we have seen in the previous section , our numerical values of @xmath8 do not reproduce this behavior quantitatively in the hyperstoichiometric region .",
    "if this picture is correct , it should also be rather general .",
    "it is worth noting that chalcogen pairing has been observed by diffraction experiment in some equiatomic liquid mixtures , e.g.  cuse@xcite and kte@xcite .",
    "the conductivity of @xmath5-cu - se has been measured over a range of composition and behaves in a similar way to that found in our simulations , showing a strong minimum at the composition cu@xmath4se and then passing through a maximum in the region of cuse before falling to the low values associated with @xmath5-se .",
    "it would clearly be interesting to investigate these and other related systems by aimd simulation .",
    "the aimd simulations we have presented lead us to the following conclusions .",
    "the reliability and realism of the dft - pseudopotential methods we have used are demonstrated by the satisfactory predictions of the equilibrium structure of the @xmath3-ag@xmath4se crystal a the quite close agreement with neutron diffraction results for the partial structure factors and rdfs .",
    "nevertheless , there are significant discrepancies , which need further investigation .",
    "the simulations have shown that a large structural change in the ag@xmath0se@xmath1 liquid begins when the se content exceeds @xmath65 , and this consists of the covalent bonding of se atoms to form clusters .",
    "these clusters are mainly chain - like , but at @xmath66 there is a significant fraction of three - fold coordinated se atoms ; the concentration of rings is extremely small . the equilibrium fraction of se present in the form of clusters can be understood on a simple charge - balance argument based on an ionic interpretation . in spite of the se clustering , the diffusion coefficients of both ag and se increase with se content .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the existence of the clusters , because the se - se bonds turn out to have very short lifetimes of less than 1  ps .",
    "the electronic density of states of liquid ag@xmath4se closely resembles that of the solid . with increasing se content , the main changes in the density of states are the splitting of the se(4@xmath21 ) into bonding and anti - bonding states and the formation of se(4@xmath22 ) bonding and anti - bonding states associated with se chains .",
    "the calculated electronic conductivity is in fair agreement with experimental values for the stoichiometric liquid , but is too large by a factor of 3  4 for higher se contents .",
    "we have suggested that this error comes partly from the use of kohn - sham energies rather than quasiparticle energies in the conductivity calculations .",
