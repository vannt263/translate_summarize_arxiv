    "dirac s somewhat unfortunate statement about  interference between two ( or more ) photons never occurring  has led to fruitful discussions clarifying the understanding of interference from a quantum mechanical point of view .",
    "these days textbook presentations elucidate that single photon light fields behave just like classical states of light  @xcite when used in a young s double - slit interference experiment  @xcite . to exhibit non - classical features , measurements which detect two- or more photon _ coincidences _",
    ", phase sensitive measurements such as homodyning and quantum tomography  @xcite , and waiting - time distribution ( anti - bunching ) measurements can be performed  @xcite .",
    "single photon detection , however , i.e. intensity or first - order coherence measurements  @xcite , are often held to be classical in character  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion stems from the analysis of young s interference patterns for single photon and glauber - coherent states of light  @xcite , single photons emitted from two atoms  @xcite and thermal fields  @xcite . in these examples quantum and classical predictions for the form and visibility of interference patterns are identical  @xcite .",
    "some physicists have therefore concluded that `` experiments of this kind which measure the first - order correlation functions of the electromagnetic field do not distinguish between the quantum and classical theories of light ''  @xcite .",
    "one can even find more generalized statements such as `` for fields with identical spectral properties it is not possible to distinguish the nature of the light source from only the first - order coherence properties ''  @xcite .",
    "differences between classical and quantum expressions for first - order coherence phenomena are commonly attributed to different frequency modes only  @xcite , but we will see that they can occur for monochromatic fields as well  @xcite .    to explain the perceived equivalence between the classical and quantum behaviour in first - order coherence phenomena some books refer to dirac s assertion regarding interference between two photons not occurring  @xcite .",
    "let us seek a more detailed explanation instead .",
    "the purpose of this @xmath1 is twofold .",
    "firstly i will give a simple general proof for the equivalence between the classical and quantum behaviour in first - order coherence phenomena for the conventional young s double - slit setup .",
    "and then , i will derive the simplest possible example based on photon statistics which should show maximal violation of the classically expected behaviour : whereas in the classical case an interference pattern with perfect visibility is observed , one should find the same in one but zero visibility in another corresponding quantum case .",
    "firstly , let us briefly reexamine young s double - slit : it is , assuming very narrow slits , a pedagogically appealing choice for explaining classical and quantum interference effects since it is an intuitive , geometrically simple , pure two - mode system . in its classic form",
    "it has the drawback , though , of not representing the most general case since both slits are illuminated from the same source .",
    "this limits the choice of states inside the interferometer to binomially distributed states of light which indeed can not show a behaviour different from classical states  @xcite . the proof is given below .",
    "giving up on this restriction allows us to tailor the quantum states needed for the non - classical behaviour of the first - order coherence we want to demonstrate here .",
    "a young s double - slit setup can be cast into the general form of a two - mode interferometer illuminated with two _ different _ fields at its two input ports by being illuminated through a semitransparent beam - splitter positioned right between its two slits .",
    "such a modified young s setup would correspond to a spatially constricted mach - zehnder interferometer . in order to avoid all issues regarding the spatial mode arrangement and parameterization of slit and screen locations  @xcite we",
    "will therefore , from now on , consider a general two - mode ( mach - zehnder ) setup as displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "= 2.6 in = 1.4 in    assuming that both beam - splitters are balanced and equal we choose the modes such that the action of the first beam splitter is described by  @xcite @xmath2 the photons following channel _ 1 _ are delayed by a tunable phase @xmath3 and are subsequently mixed with the _ 2_-channel to form the detector modes @xmath4 and @xmath5 : @xmath6 see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . for the case of a single photon entering the interferometer through mode",
    "@xmath7 we thus receive the final state @xmath8 and the well known classical photo - detector response probabilities or intensities @xmath9 note that for a single photon entering through mode @xmath10 the role of @xmath11 and @xmath12 or the signs are exchanged .",
    "a simple calculation furthermore confirms that this state is intensity balanced , that is , inside the interferometer intensities are equal @xmath13 let us summarize and generalize this result .",
    "the input modes expressed in terms of the output modes are @xmath14 as can easily be read off eq .",
    "( [ state.1.out ] ) .",
    "the result for @xmath10 is @xmath15 for a conventional young s double slit setup the chances of a single photon to pass slit _ 1 _ are equal to it passing slit  _ 2 _ , for every passing photon @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "every fock - state component results in a symmetric binomial distribution of photons , since they randomly pass one hole or the other  @xcite . in order to find the general expression for these binomial states ,",
    "let us recast this result in the operator language employed in the first equation of  ( [ mode.transformation ] ) .",
    "we find that an arbitrary pure input state for a conventional young s setup has the form @xmath17 using eq .",
    "( [ a.mode.in ] ) it immediately follows that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the average photon number of @xmath20 in equation  ( [ young.state.in ] ) . comparing this expression with ( [ signal.1.a ] )",
    "we see that the textbook case of a conventional young s double - slit indeed always shows classical behaviour .",
    "let us now study the general case of any pure states occupying modes @xmath7 and @xmath10 simultaneously . in order to get a better understanding for what we are in search of ,",
    "let us however briefly remind ourselves of some basics of the theory of optical coherence .",
    "the absolute value of the relative first - order coherence function  @xmath21 is connected with the visibility  @xmath22 of the interference pattern by  @xcite @xmath23 in our case of equal intensities this yields the result that visibility equals first order coherence  @xcite . with eq .",
    "( [ signal.a.young ] ) we have , in other words , shown that in a young s double slit setup all light states  @xcite appear to be first - order coherent , meaning @xmath24 everywhere  @xcite .",
    "since this is obviously the largest possible degree of first - order coherence the signatures of a modification due to quantum statistics can only lead to its _",
    "suppression_.    in order to study the general case of any pure states occupying modes @xmath7 and @xmath10 simultaneously we will , for simplicity , expand this state in terms of the modes _ 1 _ and _ 2 _ _ inside _ the interferometer .",
    "@xmath25 with eqs .",
    "( [ mode.transformation.2 ] ) we find @xmath26 and the corresponding expectation value for state  ( [ general.state.in ] ) is @xmath27 of the state s density matrix only the diagonal terms contribute to the background intensity and only the first off - diagonal terms determine the interference pattern . to completely erase the interference pattern we want to get rid of the first off - diagonal terms . for single photon states that is obviously impossible if one maintains the restriction of balanced illumination of both interferometric paths . indeed assuming @xmath28 immediately recovers  up to a phase",
    " our classical result  ( [ signal.1.a ] ) .    adding a second photon changes this picture considerably",
    "let us first consider the conventional young s setup again , a two - photon fock - state incident in mode @xmath7 impinging on the first beam - splitter @xmath29 leads to the inside state @xmath30 the amplitudes precisely match the corresponding weight factors in the general intensity expression  ( [ expec.a.general ] ) rendering this state first - order coherent .",
    "removal of the @xmath31-term will completely suppress this first - order coherence .",
    "the two - photon state furthest deviating from the conventional young s mono - mode input is obviously the balanced bimodal input state @xmath32 which , indeed , does not show any first order interference .",
    "this state is intensity balanced inside the interferometer .",
    "it therefore only remains to be shown that this state s non - classical behaviour can not be attributed to some kind of randomness in phase .",
    "guided by the discussion of the general intensity expression  ( [ expec.a.general ] ) we can expect that a second - order coherence measurement  @xcite ( two - photon coincidence detection with probability @xmath33 ) should give us an interference pattern of higher order since it connects diagonal density matrix elements with second off - diagonal elements .",
    "the corresponding expectation value for the detection of two photons in channel @xmath34 has indeed perfect visibility @xmath35 here the prefactor @xmath36 normalizes the sum of all detection probabilities per shot to unity .",
    "we note that the effective de broglie wavelength of this interference effect is halved with respect to the single photon detection case  @xcite . for our present considerations",
    "the most striking feature is the perfect visibility of this interference pattern which holds for @xmath33 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 as well .",
    "these are the probabilities to detect two photons in coincidence in the respective channels indicated by the subscripts  @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to show that a second - order pattern with perfect visibility can not coexist with a first - order pattern .    with these perfect second - order visibilities state  ( [ two.photon.a.b ] ) has to be free of random phase fluctuations .",
    "we are led to consider a state that has a stable relative phase  @xmath39 across both arms of the interferometer and illuminates both channels of the interferometer with equal intensity .",
    "when we seek a classical description of this state inside the interferometer before it passes the phase shifter we have to choose a combination of coherent states  @xmath40 of the form @xmath41 classically we would expect this state to be first - order coherent , quantum mechanically , however , _",
    "the first - order coherence is suppressed .",
    "_    it is clear from our discussion of the general intensity expression  ( [ expec.a.general ] ) that , by moving to the second off - diagonal of the density matrix , we have found the simplest possible case of complete suppression of first - order coherence through quantum statistics .",
    "in order to study the transition from classical to quantum behaviour let us look at states that linearly interpolate ( @xmath42 $ ] ) between the above extremes  ( [ two.photon.a ] ) ( @xmath43 ) and  ( [ two.photon.a.b ] ) ( @xmath44 ) @xmath45 these states first - order visibilities are @xmath46 , as can be seen from @xmath47 the respective channel intensities inside the interferometer are no longer balanced @xmath48 we will therefore have to compare classical and quantum behaviour using a channel intensity - independent measure , namely the ratio of first order coherence functions @xmath49 , where the subscripts stand for quantum and classical case . because of the stable relative phase  @xmath50 across both arms of the interferometer and our assumed perfect mode match  @xcite we expect @xmath51  @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ connection.visibility.g1 ] ) we can hence infer that the expected classical visibility only depends on the channel intensities , @xmath52 , which are given above . dividing the visibilities yields @xmath53 falls far below the classically expected value of 1 when we approach the bimodal input state  ( [ two.photon.a.b ] ) at @xmath54 .",
    "= 3.0 in = 1.4 in    in the quantum - classical comparison leading to fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we assumed the same channel intensities @xmath55 and @xmath56 and stability of the cross - phase  @xmath57 .",
    "one can compare the classical to the quantum case employing a different set of assumptions .",
    "we could for example keep the input intensities @xmath58 and @xmath59 matched and also vary the relative phase between modes @xmath7 and @xmath10 by , say , multiplying the latter with a phase factor : @xmath60 .",
    "input state @xmath61 of eq .",
    "( [ interpolation.state.in ] ) now depends on @xmath62 and @xmath63 and so does its classical counterpart @xmath64 here the glauber - coherent state amplitudes  @xcite match the input intensities @xmath65 and @xmath66 of state  ( [ interpolation.state.in ] ) .",
    "the interference signals seen by detector @xmath34 for the phase tunable version of  ( [ interpolation.state.in ] ) are @xmath67 and @xmath68 for its classical counterpart  ( [ interpolation.state.classical ] ) .",
    "the resulting visibilities are the pythagorean combinations of the trigonometric coefficients @xmath69 the quantum - statistical suppression @xmath70 @xmath71 is again strongest for @xmath54 .",
    "the two classical models , just presented , are incompatible with each other since the second model s input intensities @xmath58 and",
    "@xmath59 do not yield the first model s channel intensities @xmath55 and @xmath56 and vice versa .",
    "consequently this discussion is to some extent arbitrary but it still serves to show that a physically reasonable classical model can not explain the quantum - statistical suppression of first - order coherence .",
    "for experimental confirmation of the results presented here it is important to realize how easy it is to prepare the interpolation state , let us therefore rewrite eq .",
    "( [ interpolation.state.in ] ) with @xmath72 as a mixing angle @xmath73 this form can be synthesized using spontaneous parametric down - conversion  @xcite and passive linear devices .",
    "let us think of a configuration where signal  @xmath74 and idler  @xmath75 photons of a single pair are mode - matched except for orthogonal polarization , say horizontal @xmath76 and vertical @xmath22. the initial state is thus in the state @xmath77 .",
    "next the @xmath78-mode s polarization is turned such that it overlaps @xmath79 by an amount @xmath80 , subsequently the two spatial modes @xmath79 and @xmath78 are mixed with a polarization - insensitive beam splitter according to transformation  ( [ mode.transformation.2 ] ) .",

    "the presence of the @xmath85 photon allows us to identify the unwanted @xmath86-component which otherwise would pollute the contribution from the desired first two terms which constitute state  ( [ interpolation.state.in.angle ] ) .",
    "to conclude , we have given a general proof for the equivalence of the first - order coherence function for the classical and the quantum case measured with a conventional young s double - slit setup .",
    "we have shown that this equivalence does not hold for arbitrary two - mode interferometers and have derived the simplest possible case for maximal quantum - statistical suppression of first - order coherence .",
    "this case was analyzed by comparing it to two classical scenarios .",
    "finally have we shown how to synthesize the quantum states used in this paper in order to allow for experimental confirmation of the predicted quantum - statistical suppression of first - order coherence .",
    "i use the terminology of references  @xcite and refer to @xmath87 as a _ first _ order function since it is of first order in the measured intensities , this is at variance with the terminology in other parts of the literature  @xcite where it is refered to as a function of _ second _ order , in terms of amplitudes .",
    "i will only consider pure states populating single spatio - temporal modes  @xcite ( quasi - monochromatic , one polarization ) of sufficient transversal coherence length as to coherently illuminate both slits . in the case of paths overlapping at the beam splitters",
    "i always assume perfect matching of these modes .",
