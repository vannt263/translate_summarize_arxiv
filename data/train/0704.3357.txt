    "separability is one of the central issues in quantum information theory ( see horodecki @xcite for a review ) in that in a separable density matrix all correlations are of classical origin and no real quantum information processing , as based on the presence of quantum entanglement of some kind , is impossible .",
    "the solution to the separability problem has been proved to be np - hard  @xcite and hence every partial solution constitutes an important achievement .",
    "seminal corner stones in that direction have been the peres - horodecki criterion  @xcite , and entanglement witnessing operators  @xcite .",
    "the first method exploits the fact that positive operators conserve the positivity of all separable density matrices , whereas some entangled density operators are mapped to non - positive operators .",
    "the latter approach uses limits for expectation values of suitably chosen witness operators to distinguish between separable and entangled states . a systematic analysis of the so called _ bound _ entangled states has been initiated by means of unextendible product bases ( upb )  @xcite which in turn also paved the way towards a formulation of the separability problem in terms of roots of complex polynomial equations  @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , this route has not been pursued any further and in particular no direct test of separability via the convex roof extension of a pure state separability criterion has been probed so far .",
    "the main obstacles for such an approach have their origin in the complications involved in the minimization procedure over all decompositions of the density matrix under consideration .",
    "a proposal in this direction however has been presented by osborne  @xcite . in this work",
    "we follow this route proposing a similar approach for studying the bipartite separability problem in finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath7 encoding the convex roof minimization in a way familiar from statistical - mechanics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after a formal definition of the separability problem and a short discussion of pure state separability criteria in the next section , we give a geometrical view on the space of @xmath8-ensembles and a formulation of the bipartite separability problem in terms of a set of nonlinear equations in section  [ rho - ens ] .",
    "a mechanical analogy of these equations is drawn in section  [ costfun ] in terms of a hamiltonian or cost function on a restricted `` phase space '' and constitutes the basis for the statistical mechanical approach presented in section  [ statmech ] . after presenting a proof - of - principles calculation for two - qubit werner states in section  [ wernerstates ]",
    "we draw our conclusions and give a short outlook of the presented formalism .",
    "in order to formulate the problem , let us recall the following definition :    a state @xmath9 of a bipartite system @xmath10 , described by @xmath11 , is called separable if there exists a convex decomposition of @xmath9 composed entirely of product vectors : @xmath12    a natural problem arises , known as the separability problem : _ given a state @xmath9 , decide if it is separable or not .",
    "_ this problem has been proven to be np - hard ( gurvits  @xcite ) and ( a part of ) its difficulty lies in the fact that a convex decomposition of a given mixed state @xmath9 into pure states : @xmath13 is highly non - unique ( see e.g. bengtsson and @xmath14yczkowski  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the following definition makes sense :    [ roens ] unordered collection @xmath15 , @xmath16 of probabilities and vectors satisfying ( [ decomp ] ) is called a @xmath9-ensemble of length @xmath17 .    in this work",
    "we develop the following approach to the separability problem : we propose to search the space of all @xmath9-ensembles of a given state @xmath9 for product @xmath9-ensembles ( @xmath9-ensembles containing only product vectors ) , by applying one of the existing necessary and sufficient entanglement tests to each member of the ensemble .",
    "we want the test which has the simplest functional form  a polynomial .",
    "such a test is provided by the square of generalized concurrence ( see e.g. rungta  @xcite , mintert  @xcite , hulpke  @xcite ) :    [ warprod ] for any vector @xmath18 one has that : @xmath19 and the equality holds if and only if @xmath20 is product .",
    "this leads to a set of real polynomial equations describing separable states .",
    "the resulting system is very complicated due to the fourth order of some equations and a large number of variables .",
    "our idea is to study it using methods of classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the motivation is that such methods have proven to be very efficient not only within classical mechanics , but also in many other , distantly related areas ( for an application to fundamental combinatorial problems see e.g. kubasiak @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "hence , we first develop a mechanical analogy for our system .",
    "then we define a suitable cost function , or `` energy '' , introduce a canonical ensemble , and study the resulting partition function .",
    "let us begin with describing the space of all @xmath9-ensembles of a given state @xmath9 . for convenience",
    "we pass from normalized @xmath9-ensemble vectors @xmath21 to subnormalized ones : @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 .",
    "let us fix an eigenensemble @xmath24 of @xmath9 , where all the vectors @xmath25 correspond to non - zero eigenvalues @xmath26 of @xmath9 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the rank of @xmath9 .",
    "then , all @xmath9-ensembles are characterized by the well known theorem by schrdinger  @xcite ( see also  @xcite )    [ hjw ] any @xmath9-ensemble @xmath29 of length @xmath30 can be obtained from a subnormalized eigenensemble @xmath24 such that @xmath31 through the following linear transformation : @xmath32 where the matrix @xmath33 is an @xmath34 block of a unitary @xmath35 matrix , and hence satisfies @xmath36    theorem  [ hjw ] gives us the characterization of all possible @xmath9-ensembles in terms of @xmath34 matrices @xmath37 , satisfying the condition ( [ stiefel ] ) .",
    "geometrically , this condition defines the so called _ stiefel manifold _ @xmath38 it forms a principal fiber bundle over the grassmann manifold @xmath39 ( the set of @xmath40-dimensional subspaces of @xmath41 ) with a fiber diffeomorphic to @xmath42 ( we refer to kobayashi and nomizu vol .  1  @xcite for the definition and basic properties of fiber bundles and to spivak vol",
    ". 5  @xcite for more information on the stiefel and grassmann manifolds ) .",
    "however , note that there is some additional symmetry : from eq .",
    "( [ decomp ] ) we see that the order of vectors in a @xmath9-ensemble does not matter , and thus two @xmath43 matrices @xmath37 , @xmath44 satisfying eq .  ( [ stiefel ] ) and differing only by a permutation of their rows define the same @xmath9-ensemble . to fix this freedom , observe that a @xmath37-matrix satisfying eq .",
    "( [ stiefel ] ) has necessarily rank @xmath40 , and hence we may consider only those matrices @xmath37 , for which the first @xmath40 rows are linearly independent .",
    "the set of such @xmath37 s constitutes a simply connected open subset of @xmath45 ( which is nevertheless dense in @xmath45 ) and over such a neighborhood the bundle @xmath46{u(r)}g_{n , r}$ ] is trivial by construction .",
    "this allows us to formally write down an explicit solution of the constraints ( [ stiefel ] ) @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the @xmath50 unit matrix , @xmath51 is an arbitrary , complex @xmath52 matrix , and @xmath53 denotes the gram - schmidt orthonormalization  @xcite applied to the columns .",
    "there are no more symmetries , since we have defined in definition  [ roens ] @xmath9-ensembles using vectors @xmath54 rather than more physical projectors @xmath55 , as the latter are harder to work with . in case of @xmath9-ensembles defined through projectors",
    ", there would be an additional symmetry of multiplying each row of @xmath37 by a ( different ) phase .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "( [ srozw ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ens ] ) , one sees that an arbitrary @xmath9-ensemble of length @xmath17 is obtained from the fixed eigenensemble by i ) applying a unitary rotation to @xmath56 s and ii ) subsequent increasing of the length of the ensemble along the grassmannian @xmath39 .",
    "so far we have characterized @xmath9-ensembles of a fixed length @xmath17 .",
    "it seems that in the search for product ensemble we would have to consider all possible lengths @xmath30 .",
    "however , from caratheodory s theorem ( see e.g. kelly and weiss  @xcite ) we know that a separable state can be decomposed into at most @xmath57 linear independent ( in @xmath58 ) product states .",
    "hence , it is enough to consider only @xmath9-ensembles of the length @xmath57 .",
    "( there is a natural inclusion of space of shorter ensembles in the space of longer ones ) .",
    "let us now examine the entanglement test given by proposition  [ warprod ] .",
    "first , we quote some well known facts regarding the geometry of pure product states ( see e.g. bengtsson and @xmath14yczkowski  @xcite ) .",
    "note that the polynomial @xmath59 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ test ] ) , is in fact a sum of modulus squared of quadratic , complex - analytical polynomials in @xmath20 : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 are orthonormal bases of the skew - symmetric spaces @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath65 , and hence @xmath20 is product , if and only if @xmath66 it is worth noticing that this is just the condition for the matrix of components of @xmath20 to have rank one .",
    "geometrically , the system of homogeneous equations ( [ segre ] ) , or equivalently the single equation @xmath65 , describes the image of the so called _ segre embedding _ @xmath67 given by @xmath68,[y])\\mapsto [ x\\otimes y]$ ] . as we can see from eqs .",
    "( [ segre ] ) , this image , i.e. the set of product vectors , is a complex - analytical manifold  as an intersection of complex quadrics  in contrast to the stiefel manifolds @xmath45 , which are real .    since for all @xmath69 polynomials @xmath70",
    "are non - negative and equal to zero if and only if @xmath54 is product , we can sum them up for a given @xmath9-ensemble , and thus obtain a collective separability test for the whole @xmath9-ensemble , given by a single polynomial function . combining this with the parametrization ( [ ens ] ) and the constraint ( [ stiefel ] )",
    ", we obtain the following description of separable states :    [ p2 ] a states @xmath9 of rank @xmath40 on @xmath71 is separable if and only if the following system of equations possesses a solution @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the projectors from @xmath75 , @xmath76 onto the skew - symmetric subspaces @xmath77 , @xmath78 respectively .",
    "we note that the pure state entanglement measure we use is the square of the generalized concurrence @xmath79 ( cf .",
    "rungta  @xcite , mintert  @xcite ) , however , instead of the convex roof construction @xmath80 ( where @xmath21 are normalized vectors ) , we analyze @xmath81 as a `` quantifier '' of entanglement .",
    "we remind the reader that no caveats are introduced by this , since we are only interested in the detection of zero entanglement rather than in the full construction of an entanglement monotone .",
    "note that the eqs .",
    "( [ h ] ) , ( [ wiaz ] ) are invariant with respect to local unitary transformations , since when @xmath9 is separable also @xmath82 is , for arbitrary @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "the latter transformation can be viewed either as a local change of basis ( passive view ) or as an active rotation ( active view ) .",
    "indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ test ] ) one immediately sees that @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the function @xmath86 and all quantities derived from it are constant on the whole unitary class of @xmath9 , i.e. on @xmath87:=\\{u_a\\otimes u_b\\varrho u_a^\\dagger\\otimes u_b^\\dagger\\ , ; \\ , u_a\\in u(m ) , u_b\\in u(n)\\}$ ] . in",
    "what follows , we refer with @xmath9 to its local unitary class @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "we give a brief comparison to a previous analysis carried out by wu in ref .",
    "@xcite , also leading to a different set of polynomial equations .",
    "these authors have used a higher order polynomial test for separability : let @xmath88 , then @xmath20 is product if and only if @xmath89 . the relation to eq .",
    "( [ test ] ) is established by observing that @xmath90 , where @xmath91 s form a basis of @xmath92-invariant polynomials ( see e.g. ref .",

    "( [ test ] ) ) . for testing separability , it is sufficient to consider only @xmath94 .",
    "equations ( [ h ] ) and ( [ wiaz ] ) form a system of real ( after taking real and imaginary parts ) polynomial equations .",
    "let us denote by @xmath95 the set of its solutions for a given @xmath9 .",
    "then the separability problem is equivalent to the question whether @xmath95 is empty or not . in principle",
    "there is a general solution to such problem , provided by the so called _ real nullstellensatz _",
    "( see e.g. bochnak  @xcite ) .",
    "it says that @xmath96 if and only if the ideal generated by the polynomials @xmath86 , @xmath97 , and by all ( real ) sum - of - squares ( sos ) polynomials contains the constant @xmath98 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath96 if and only if there exist a sos polynomial @xmath99 , a real polynomial @xmath100 , and ( complex ) polynomials @xmath101 such that : @xmath102.\\ ] ] however , finding such a certificate is computationally very difficult and inefficient , due to the fact that the degrees of polynomials @xmath103 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 are a priori unbounded ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    here",
    "we develop a different approach based on a statistical analysis of a classical - mechanical analogy .",
    "namely , we treat @xmath104 as a collection of complex row vectors @xmath105 and treat each row @xmath106 as a complex phase - space coordinate of a fictitious particle moving in @xmath40-dimensional space . then the whole matrix @xmath104 becomes a phase - space coordinate of a system of @xmath17 such particles in their composite phase - space @xmath107 .",
    "now , let @xmath108 and @xmath109 be defined by eqs .",
    "( [ h ] ) and ( [ wiaz ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath86 depends on the separability class of the analyzed state @xmath9 through the fixed eigenensemble @xmath110 . from the property ( [ test ] ) it follows that @xmath111 we will think of @xmath86 as a cost function or hamiltonian ( it is extensive in the number of fictitious particles @xmath17 ) , of our fictitious mechanical system .",
    "then , we can treat @xmath112 as at the primary constraints imposed on the a priori independent phase - space coordinates @xmath113 .",
    "we note that even if the mechanical system corresponds to free particles ( if @xmath114 was diagonal ) the resulting model is nevertheless interacting due to the forces of inertia induced by the non - linear constraints .    the corner stones of the mechanical interpretation of the separability problem ( [ h ] ) , ( [ wiaz ] ) can be summarized as follows : the @xmath9-ensembles of density matrices with a fixed rank @xmath40 form the stiefel manifold @xmath45 , which we can be viewed at as a constraint surface in the phase - space @xmath115 .",
    "each state @xmath9 defines the non - negative cost operator @xmath116 which uniquely defines the cost function @xmath86 on @xmath115 , which probes the separability of the ensembles .",
    "the cost function @xmath86 assumes the value zero on the constraint surface @xmath45 ( which is then its global minimum ) if and only if @xmath9 is separable .",
    "although in principle one could tempt to solve the constraints explicitly by eq .",
    "( [ srozw ] ) , the resulting parametrization of the constrained manifold is rather hard to work with due to the iterative nature of the gram - schmidt orthonormalization .",
    "we circumvent the complications with an explicit incorporation of the constraints by using a standard method of implicit treatment of constrained systems due to dirac  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the introduction of lagrange multipliers . to this end",
    "we define the full hamiltonian of the systems as @xmath117 where @xmath118 are the lagrange multipliers .",
    "note that the constraints written in the matrix @xmath112 are not all independent : it is in fact a hermitian matrix and we need to employ one lagrange multiplier for each independent constraint only .",
    "on the other hand we have considerable freedom for choosing the spurious lagrange multipliers in the lagrange matrix @xmath119 .",
    "we choose @xmath119 to be hermitian .",
    "then , @xmath120 is hermitian and has only real eigenvalues .",
    "moreover , in order to take into account all independent constraints , we require that @xmath121 . the constraints @xmath122",
    "are then realized on average by setting to zero the variation of @xmath120 with respect to @xmath118 : @xmath123 .",
    "the number of fictitious particles @xmath17 will in general be notably large  in dimension @xmath124 for example we have @xmath125 .",
    "thus , the direct analytical study of our fictitious mechanical system seems rather hopeless and we proceed further using methods of statistical mechanics and numerical simulations .",
    "the most natural framework would be microcanonical ensemble , however it is also difficult to work with .",
    "hence , we will introduce a canonical ensemble , keeping in mind that this is just a technical tool , so , for example , the inverse temperature @xmath126 plays only a role of a parameter here , without any physical meaning .",
    "we proceed to define the canonical partition function @xmath127 for our system .",

    "( [ constr ] ) one has to search for a saddle point of @xmath242 with respect to @xmath162 ( or equivalently with respect to @xmath243 ; cf .",

    "we also obtained some numerical evidence that in the generic case the minima of @xmath250 were attained for matrices @xmath232 very close to ( [ choice ] ) .",
    "the results of the simulations for @xmath241 are presented in fig .",
    "[ wykres1 ] ( the results for higher values of @xmath126 did not differ from those for @xmath241 ) .",
    "we see that for @xmath251 the constraints ( [ constr ] ) can be satisfied .",
    "we shall call the interval where it happens `` equipartition region '' .     the plot of @xmath252 for @xmath253 on a double log scale . ]    next , the dependence of the average entanglement @xmath252 ( cf .",
    "( [ avh ] ) ) of the continuous ensemble ( [ cont_ens ] ) on @xmath126 within the equipartition region was examined ( recall that outside this region the one - particle constraints ( [ cont_ens ] ) are no longer satisfied ) .",
    "[ wykres2 ] shows a sample plot for @xmath254 .",
    "one sees that the average `` energy '' indeed scales like @xmath146 , just like predicted by the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ 1/b ] ) .",
    "the estimated exponent @xmath148 at this value of @xmath240 is @xmath255 . we have also checked that in the limiting case @xmath256 the equipartition region is not altered .",
    "hence , our procedure seems to detect separability of the werner states ( [ werners ] ) at least for @xmath257 and thus can serve only as a sufficient condition for separability .",
    "we did not check the behavior of @xmath252 outside the equipartition region @xmath258 .",
    "the statistical mechanical approach to the separability problem as presented here differs from the more traditional techniques in that we studied the space of convex decompositions of a given state , rather than the convex set of all states .",
    "the resulting polynomial equations are real due to the constraint ( [ wiaz ] ) and this real structure makes the analysis more complicated than it would be in a complex case .",
    "hence , we applied statistical - mechanical methods to study possible zeros of this system .",
    "as an example we studied @xmath147 werner states ( [ werners ] ) . however , the numerical difficulty already at this simple example was quite high and we have applied several simplifications .",
    "nevertheless , the numerical results suggest that at least for separable states in a vicinity of the identity , the partition function and the average `` energy '' , related to the ensemble entanglement ( cf . eq.([p^2 ] ) , show some qualitative change in their behavior .",
    "there are obviously some important questions left .",
    "first of all , we postulated rather than derived the power - law state density behavior ( [ 1/b ] ) for entangled states .",
    "it would be an interesting , albeit difficult , task to try to analytically derive this law . or at least to find some arguments in its favor .",
    "another thing is that in passing from the full @xmath17-particle constrains ( [ constr_stare ] ) to the one - particle one ( [ constr ] ) we have tacitly assumed a sort of `` equipartition '' of the constraints , i.e. that the constraints are divided equally among the particles .",
    "but it actually does not have to be like that .",
    "in particular , the shape of the curve in fig .  [ wykres1 ]",
    "tells us that below @xmath259 the constrains are not `` equiparted '' .",
    "thus , in principle one should work with the full @xmath17-particle partition function ( [ z_stare ] ) and seek regions were full constraints ( [ constr_stare ] ) can be satisfied",
    ". then the scaling of the average `` energy '' with @xmath126 within that regions will be able to discriminate between separability and entanglement .    as a side remark",
    ", we note that quite surprisingly , the value @xmath259 appears in braunstein  @xcite separability criterion , based on an estimation of the size of a ball of separable states around the normalized identity ( see also bengtsson and @xmath14yczkowski  @xcite and the references therein )",
    ". it will be worth analyzing this curious coincidence in order to gain a deeper understanding of the strengths and weak points of the presented approach .",
    "finally , let us mention that in principle one can try to directly numerically calculate integral ( [ zinna ] ) using monte carlo method .",
    "the points of @xmath45 can be generated either using eq .",
    "( [ srozw ] ) or , what seems more feasible , directly from definition ( [ st ] ) .",
    "the latter method amounts to generating random unitary matrices from @xmath260 and discarding @xmath261 of their columns ( for the methods of random generation of unitary ensembles see e.g. poniak  @xcite ) .",
