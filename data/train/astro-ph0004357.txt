    "observations of the angular power spectrum of the cmb temperature fluctuations are a powerful probe of the fundamental parameters of our universe .",
    "the amplitude and spatial distribution of these fluctuations can discriminate between competing cosmological models .",
    "most inflationary models predict more power on scales of 02    2@xmath0 , in the form of a series of peaks .",
    "these are due to acoustic oscillations in the photon - baryon fluid , which are frozen into the cmb at recombination , with the peaks corresponding to regions of maximum compression and troughs regions of maximum rarefaction .",
    "hence , the position of the first acoustic peak is a strong test for the geometry of the universe , since it corresponds to a fixed physical scale at the time of recombination projected onto the sky .    the previous result from the jodrell  bank  ",
    "iac 33  ghz interferometer of @xmath3 , reported in dicker ( 1999 ) , corresponds to an angular spherical harmonic @xmath4 , equivalent to @xmath5 2@xmath0 structure . to investigate smaller angular scales",
    "the baseline was doubled ; in this paper we analyze the data from this wide spacing configuration which corresponds to an angular spherical harmonic @xmath6 .",
    "the data presented here were taken at the teide observatory , tenerife , between 27 may 1998 and 9 march 1999 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the instrumental configuration is summarised in section  [ int33 ] ; a full description can be found in melhuish ( 1999 ) .",
    "the basic data processing is outlined in section  [ bdpcal ] ; for a more complete discussion see dicker ( 1999 ) .",
    "the calibration method is also discussed in section  [ bdpcal ] and the data analysis in section  [ like ] .",
    "a derivation of the fluctuation amplitude , after an estimate of the contribution of possible foregrounds , is given in section  [ fore ] .",
    "( 20,10.5)(0,0 ) ( 0.7,-6 )    the interferometer consists of two horn - reflector antennas positioned to form a single e  w baseline , which has two possible lengths depending on the separation of the horns .",
    "the narrow spacing configuration has a baseline of 152 mm while in its wide spacing configuration the horns are 304 mm apart . for the observations presented here , the baseline was 304 mm .",
    "observations were made at a fixed declination of dec=+41@xmath0 , using the rotation of the earth to `` scan '' 24@xmath7  in ra each day .",
    "this `` scan '' runs through some of the lowest background levels of synchrotron , dust and free - free emission .",
    "the horn polarization is horizontal ",
    "parallel with the scan direction .",
    "there are two data outputs representing the cosine and the sine components of the complex interferometer visibility .",
    "the operating bandwidth covers 31    34ghz , near a local minimum in the atmospheric emission spectrum ; the antenna spacing corresponds to 32.9 wavelengths .",
    "the low level of precipitable water vapour , which is typically around 3 mm at teide observatory , permits the collection of high quality data .",
    "only 16 per cent of the data have been rejected , due to bad weather and the daily sun transit .",
    "the measured response of the interferometer is well approximated by a gaussian with sigmas of = 225 @xmath8 003 ( in ra ) and = 100 @xmath9 002 ( in dec ) , modulated by fringes with a period of @xmath10 = 174 @xmath9 002 in ra .",
    "this defines the range of sensitivity to the different multipoles @xmath11 of the cmb power spectrum ( @xmath12 ) in the range corresponding to a maximum sensitivity at @xmath11 = 208 ( 08 ) and half sensitivity at @xmath1318 .    a known calibration signal ( cal ) is periodically injected into the waveguide after the horns allowing a continuous calibration and concomitant corrections for drifts in the system gain and phase offset .",
    "the first step in the analysis is the removal of any variable baseline offsets from the data and the correction of a small departure from quadrature between the cosine and sine data .",
    "the data are calibrated relative to the cal signal and re - binned into 2  -  minute bins to ensure alignment in ra between successive scans .",
    "the data affected by the sun and bad weather are removed and individual scans are weighted , with respect to their rms error , to form a `` stack '' . the total stack of all the data used for this analysis is shown in fig .   [ stack ] .",
    "the number of observations at each ra varies from 210 to 180 days due the removal of @xmath14 about the sun transit each day .",
    "the data are calibrated relative to cal , although cal itself needs to be calibrated by an astronomical source .",
    "the large size of the primary beam results in a reduced sensitivity to point sources and many days of observation are required to achieve a signal  -  to  -  noise ratio sufficient for calibration purposes .",
    "consequently , the moon is used as the primary calibrator as the power received from a single moon transit is large enough to give signal  -  to  -  noise ratios of @xmath15 . +",
    "the moon was modelled as a uniform disk of radius @xmath16  and a 33  ghz brightness temperature , @xmath17 given by :    @xmath18    where @xmath19  is the phase of the moon ( measured from full moon ) and @xmath20 = 41@xmath0  is a phase offset caused by the finite thermal conductivity of the moon @xcite .",
    "it is sufficient to model the moon as a uniform disk when correcting for its partial resolution by the interferometer .",
    "the effect of temperature variations across the moon are negligible when compared to the error , 5.5 per cent , of the gorenstein and smoot model for the moon s brightness temperature . the expected antenna temperature , @xmath21 ,",
    "can then be found by integrating over the disk of the moon , multiplied by the normalized interferometer beam function :    @xmath22    where @xmath23  and @xmath24 .  and",
    "are the ra and dec beam sigmas ( dispersion ) and @xmath10 is the fringe spacing .",
    "regular observations of the moon were made ; for each observation , equation  [ dilute ] was evaluated numerically and an amplitude for cal found such that the amplitude of the moon in the processed data was equal to the predicted value . using 27 observations of the moon , an average amplitude for cal of 14.7 @xmath8 0.8k was found .",
    "the error consists of a 1.4 per cent error in the measurements and an estimated 5.5 per cent in the moon model @xcite .",
    "[ moon1 ] shows our observations and how the measured brightness temperatures of the moon change with phase .",
    "the moon model used in this paper differs from the model given in dicker  ( 1999 ) .",
    "this data together with the addition data taken in the narrow spacing , section  [ conclusions ] , will be the subject of a forthcoming paper , using the moon model given in this paper .",
