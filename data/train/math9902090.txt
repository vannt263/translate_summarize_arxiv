    "in a recent paper @xcite , m. kontsevich gave a general formula for the deformation quantization @xcite of the algebra of functions on a poisson manifold .",

    "we review kontsevich s formula in sect .",
    "[ s-2 ] .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe this quantum field theory explicitly .",
    "it turns out that it is a simple bosonic topological quantum field theory on a disc @xmath0 with a field @xmath1 taking values in the poisson manifold @xmath2 and a one - form @xmath3 on @xmath0 taking values in the pull - back @xmath4 of the cotangent bundle . the formula for the star product is @xmath5}dx\\,d\\eta,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 are three distinct points on the boundary of @xmath0 .",
    "the integral is normalized in such a way that in the case of the trivial poisson structure the star product reduces to the ordinary product .",
    "the action @xmath7 is described in sect .",
    "[ s - sigma ] and was originally studied for manifolds without boundary in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular the canonical quantization on the cylinder was considered .    in the symplectic case the above formula essentially reduces to the original feynman path integral formula for quantum mechanics , as pointed out to us by h. ooguri .",
    "the quantization of the theory is somewhat subtle , due to the presence of a gauge symmetry which only closes on shell , as already noticed in @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the action @xmath7 is a function of the fields annihilated by a distribution of vector fields which is only integrable on the set of critical points of @xmath7 . as a consequence",
    ", the brst quantization fails and one has to resort to the batalin  vilkovisky method ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this method yields a gauge fixed action , which turns out to have a superconformal invariance .",
    "its perturbative expansion around constant classical solutions reproduces kontsevich s formula .    as an application",
    ", we show in sect .",
    "[ s - centre ] by quantum field theory methods that there exists a star product equivalent to kontsevich s whose center consists of the power series in @xmath8 whose coefficients are in the center of the poisson algebra .",
    "a rigorous proof of this statement will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "more generally , we may consider a path integral associated to an arbitrary _ polyvector field _",
    ", a formal sum of skew - symmetric contravariant tensor fields of arbitrary rank , the star product being the special case of bivector fields . correlation",
    "functions of boundary fields yield then a map @xmath9 from polyvector fields to polydifferential operators .",
    "formal properties of this map can be deduced from bv and factorization methods of quantum field theory .",
    "this leads to identities , also found by kontsevich , which may be thought of as the open string analog of the wdvv equations @xcite .",
    "they may be formulated by saying that @xmath9 is an @xmath10 morphism @xcite .",
    "they imply the associativity of the star product and , in the general setting of arbitrary polyvector fields , the formality conjecture @xcite .",
    "these constructions are explained in sect .",
    "[ s - linfty ] .",
    "although the non - rigorous quantum field theory arguments of this paper are of course no substitute for the proofs in @xcite , this approach offers an explanation for why kontsevich s construction works , and puts it in the context of feynman s original picture of quantization @xcite . moreover , our approach indicates the way for more general constructions .",
    "in particular , one can consider the perturbative expansion around a non - trivial classical solution , one can insert a hamiltonian and one can consider this quantum field theory on a complex curve of higher genus .",
    "we plan to study these variants in the future",

    "in @xcite , m. kontsevich wrote a beautiful explicit solution to the problem of deformation quantization of the algebra of functions on a poisson manifold @xmath2 .",

    "the bidifferential operator @xmath39 corresponds to the diagram @xmath23 with vertices @xmath40 and edges @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "kontsevich s formula is then @xmath43 the weight @xmath44 is the integral of a differential form over the configuration space @xmath45 of @xmath22 ordered points on the upper half plane @xmath46 .",
    "it is defined as follows : for any two distinct points @xmath47 in the upper half plane with the poincar metric @xmath48 , let @xmath49 be the angle between the ( vertical ) geodesic connecting @xmath50 to @xmath51 and the geodesic connecting @xmath50 to @xmath52 , measured in counterclockwise direction .",
    "let @xmath53 denote the differential of this angle .",
    "then the weight is @xmath54 where we set @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the orientation is induced from the product of the standard orientation of the upper half plane .",
    "for example , we have two graphs of order one , differing in the ordering of edges .",
    "let us compute the weight of these diagrams .",
    "let @xmath23 be the diagram with @xmath57 . to compute the integral over @xmath58 we introduce new variables @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "as @xmath61 varies between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the angle @xmath64 varies from @xmath62 to @xmath65 .",
    "as we vary @xmath66 on the half - line of constant @xmath64 , the angle @xmath67 varies between @xmath64 ( at infinity ) and @xmath65 ( at @xmath68 ) .",
    "thus this change of variables is a diffeomorphism from the upper half plane to the domain @xmath69 in @xmath70 .",
    "the above description also shows that this diffeomorphism is orientation preserving .",
    "thus @xmath71 ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 is positively oriented ) .",
    "the other diagram has @xmath74 and gives the same contribution with the opposite sign .",
    "therefore the coefficient of @xmath75 is @xmath76 by the skew - symmetry of @xmath13 .",
    "let us conclude this section with some remarks about involutions .",
    "the opposite product @xmath77 is related to the product by a change of sign of @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is obtained from @xmath23 by exchanging @xmath26 and @xmath25 , and @xmath80 if @xmath23 is of order @xmath22 , since @xmath81 is the integral of the pull - back of the differential form defining @xmath44 by the reflection about the axis @xmath82 which reverses the orientation of @xmath46 .",
    "since the weights @xmath44 are real , this implies that complex conjugation , extended to @xmath16 $ ] by setting @xmath83 , is an antilinear antiautomorphism for the star product .",
    "we start by introducing a sigma model action . the perturbative expansion of correlation functions of boundary fields on the disc",
    "will then be related to the star product .",
    "the model has two real bosonic fields @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 is a map from the disc @xmath86 to @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a differential 1-form on @xmath0 taking values in the pull - back by @xmath85 of the cotangent bundle of @xmath2 , i.e.  a section of @xmath87 . in local coordinates , @xmath85 is given by @xmath88 functions @xmath89 and @xmath3 by @xmath88 differential 1-forms @xmath90 .",

    "we then claim that the star product is given by the semiclassical expansion of the path integral comes from a symplectic form @xmath95 , one can integrate formally over @xmath3 and this formula may , in the spirit of feynman @xcite , be written as @xmath96 the integral over trajectories @xmath97 is to be understood as an expansion around the classical solution @xmath98 , which is a constant function of time since the hamiltonian vanishes . ] @xmath5}dx\\,d\\eta.\\ ] ] here @xmath62 , @xmath24 , @xmath99 are any three cyclically ordered points on the unit circle ( which we secretely view as the completed real line by stereographic projection ) .",
    "cyclically ordered means that if we start from @xmath62 and move on the circle counterclockwise we first meet @xmath24 and then @xmath99 .",
    "the path integral is over all @xmath1 , @xmath100 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath101 , @xmath102 if @xmath103 and @xmath104 is tangent to @xmath94 .",
    "its semiclassical expansion is to be understood as an expansion around the classical solution @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "to evaluate this path integral we have as usual to take gauge fixing and renormalization into account .",
    "this action is invariant under the following infinitesimal gauge transformations with infinitesimal parameter @xmath107 , which is a section of @xmath4 and vanishes on the boundary of @xmath0 : @xmath108 this symmetry is an extension of more familiar gauge symmetries encountered in special cases . on one extreme",
    "we have @xmath109 and the action is invariant under translations of @xmath3 by exact one - forms on @xmath0 . on the other extreme we have the symplectic case where @xmath35 is an invertible matrix so that integrating formally over @xmath3 we get the action @xmath110 which is invariant under arbitrary translations @xmath111 , with @xmath112 on the boundary of @xmath0 .",
    "another special case is the case when @xmath2 is a vector space and @xmath13 is a _ linear _ function on @xmath2 . in this case",
    "@xmath2 is the dual space to a lie algebra @xmath113 with kirillov ",
    "kostant poisson structure .",
    "the lie bracket of two linear functions @xmath114 is just the poisson bracket and is again a linear function on @xmath2 .",
    "then the classical action is best viewed as a function of a field @xmath85 taking values in @xmath115 and a connection @xmath116 on a trivial principal bundle on @xmath0 .",
    "after an integration by parts , the action becomes the `` bf action '' @xcite @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the curvature of @xmath116 . in this case the gauge transformation is the usual gauge transformation ( with gauge parameter @xmath119 ) of a connection and a field @xmath85 in the coadjoint representation .    in the general case ,",
    "the commutator of two gauge transformations is a gauge transformation only on shell , i.e. , modulo the equations of motion : @xmath120x^i&= & \\delta_{\\{\\beta,\\beta'\\}}x^i,\\\\ { } [ \\delta_\\beta,\\delta_{\\beta'}]\\eta_i&= & \\delta_{\\{\\beta,\\beta'\\}}\\eta_i -\\partial_i\\partial_k\\alpha^{rs}\\beta_r\\beta'_s ( dx^k+\\alpha^{kj}(x)\\eta_j).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath121 and @xmath122 is an euler - lagrange equation for the action @xmath7 . in this calculation the jacobi identity ( [ e - jacobi ] ) plays an essential role .",
    "thus the gauge transformations form a lie algebra only when acting on critical points ( classical solutions ) of @xmath7 .    in the brst formalism one",
    "then promotes the infinitesimal gauge parameter @xmath107 to an anticommuting ghost field ( vanishing on the boundary of the disc ) and introduces the brst operator @xmath123 , an odd derivation on the functions of @xmath124 such that @xmath125 then @xmath123 is a differential on shell , i.e. , it squares to zero modulo the equations of motion .",
    "more precisely we have @xmath126 and @xmath127 we assign a gradation , the ghost number , to our fields : @xmath128 , @xmath129 .",
    "the brst operator has then ghost number one .",
    "additionally we have the gradation of the fields as differential forms on the disc , which will be denoted by deg : @xmath130 , @xmath131 .    in the case @xmath132 of linear poisson structures ,",
    "the second derivatives of @xmath13 vanish , and the brst operator squares to zero .",
    "if the brst operator squares to zero only modulo the equations of motion , the usual brst procedure to evaluate the path integral does not quite work , since it essentially requires a well - defined cohomology to construct physical observables .",
    "the generalization of the brst procedure that works in this case is the batalin ",
    "vilkovisky method .",
    "the recipe is as follows .",
    "one first adds antifields @xmath133 with complementary ghost number and degree as differential forms on @xmath0 .",
    "the assignments of degree ( from left to right ) and ghost number ( from top to bottom ) are given by @xmath134 one then looks for a batalin  vilkovisky action @xmath135 $ ] of ghost number zero depending on fields @xmath136 ( here @xmath137 ) and antifields @xmath138 , with @xmath139 and @xmath140 subject to two requirements .",
    "the first requirement is that @xmath141 $ ] reduces to the classical action @xmath142 $ ] when the antifields are set to zero and the second requirement is that @xmath143 obeys the quantum master equation @xmath144 the bv laplacian @xmath145 and the bv antibracket are defined as follows .",
    "let us introduce temporarily a riemannian metric on @xmath0 , and denote by @xmath146 the induced scalar product on the exterior algebra of the cotangent space at @xmath66 .",
    "the volume form @xmath147 will be denoted by @xmath148 .",
    "the hodge star @xmath149 then obeys @xmath150 .",
    "the expression for the laplacian is better expressed in terms of the hodge dual antifields @xmath151 the laplacian of a function of fields and antifields is @xmath152 the functional derivatives of a function of fields and antifields , collectively denoted by @xmath153 , are the distributions ( de rham currents ) defined by @xmath154 for any test forms @xmath155 of the same degree and ghost number as @xmath153 .",
    "note that the laplacian is the restriction of a distribution on @xmath156 to the diagonal , and is thus a singular object in this infinite dimensional context .",
    "it should be understood as the limit of a suitably regularized expression .",
    "the laplacian obeys @xmath157 where the _ batalin  vilkovisky antibracket _ is @xmath158 this antibracket is better defined than the laplacian , in the sense that if @xmath159 and @xmath160 are local functionals of the fields and antifields , such as the action @xmath7 , then the functional derivatives are regular distributions and @xmath161 is again a local functional .",
    "moreover , it is independent of the choice of riemannian metric : it can be expressed without reference to the metric at the cost of introducing signs : @xmath162 here the derivatives of a function @xmath159 of fields and antifields @xmath163 are the distributions defined by @xmath164 for any test forms @xmath155 of the same degree and ghost number as @xmath153 .",
    "the antibracket obeys the graded commutativity relation @xmath165 and the leibnitz rule @xmath166 in the general case of field theories with non - trivial renormalization the bv action depends on @xmath8 through counterterms and the full quantum master equation is solved by a recursive procedure order by order in @xmath8 . here , as we shall see ,",
    "the renormalization is rather trivial and the batalin ",
    "vilkovisky action satisfies separately the equation @xmath167 and the classical master equation @xmath168 the classical master equation implies that the bv version of the brst operator @xmath169 defined by @xmath170 is a differential .",
    "it obeys the leibnitz rule @xmath171 and it acts on fields and antifields by the rule @xmath172 one semi - systematic way to find the bv action , which is under suitable hypotheses unique up to the bv version of canonical transformations , is to start with the obvious action @xmath173 , which has brst operator @xmath174 and then add suitable terms , so that the new brst operator obeys @xmath175 .",
    "since @xmath176 contains a term proportional to the equations of motion ( plus terms involving antifields ) which we need to cancel from @xmath177 , it is natural to add a term quadratic in @xmath178 to achieve our goal .",
    "it turns out that @xmath179 does the job .",
    "moreover @xmath143 is brst closed ( i.e. , it obeys @xmath180 ) , which is equivalent to the classical master equation .",
    "this is more conveniently shown in the superfield formalism of the next subsection .",
    "we claim that , if the regularization is appropriate , @xmath167 .",
    "indeed the only terms contributing to the laplacian of the bv action contain both a field and its antifield : @xmath181 here @xmath182 is an infinite constant .",
    "the factor takes into account the contribution of the first term ( 1 ) , of the second term ( @xmath183 since the one - form @xmath184 has two components ) and the third term ( @xmath24 ) . in an appropriate regularization scheme , this cancellation",
    "is supposed to be valid before removing the regularization , in spite of the fact that @xmath182 tends to infinity .",
    "let us conclude this subsection by discussing the boundary conditions of the various fields .",
    "the rule is that hodge dual antifields must have the same boundary conditions as the fields .",
    "the boundary conditions for the fields are that , for @xmath103 , @xmath185 and @xmath93 vanishes on vectors tangent to the boundary .",
    "thus @xmath186 and @xmath187 vanishes on vectors normal to the boundary .",
    "it turns out that the calculations simplify if we combine our fields and antifields into superfields .",
    "these are functions of the even coordinates @xmath188 on @xmath0 and odd ( anticommuting ) coordinates @xmath189 .",
    "thus a superfield @xmath190 has the form @xmath191 .",
    "its components fields are a scalar function @xmath192 , a one - form @xmath193 and a two form @xmath194 .",
    "the fields of total degree ( degree+ghost number ) zero combine into even superfields @xmath195 , the `` super - coordinates '' . @xmath196 and the fields of total degree one combine into odd superfields @xmath197 , the `` super - one - forms '' : @xmath198 let @xmath199 .",
    "this operator acts on component fields as the de rham differential .",
    "then the brst operator @xmath169 acts as an odd derivation on functions of the superfields @xmath195 , @xmath197 by the rule @xmath200 it is easy to check that the jacobi identity implies @xmath175 .",
    "the action of @xmath169 on components field can then easily be evaluated by comparing coefficients and taking into account the sign rule @xmath201 .",
    "one gets @xmath202 and @xmath203 this brst operator coincides with the one obtained by the batalin ",
    "vilkovisky procedure .",
    "the batalin ",
    "vilkovisky action is the integral @xmath204 of the two - form part @xmath205 of @xmath206 it is brst closed , i.e. , it obeys the master equation .",
    "in fact one has @xmath207 so that @xmath208 is the differential of a one form which vanishes along the boundary .",
    "we compute the path integral in the lorentz - type gauge @xmath209 .",
    "the hodge @xmath149 operator ( alias the almost complex structure ) depends on the conformal structure and the orientation of @xmath210 : in terms of the standard coordinates , @xmath211 , @xmath212 .",
    "let us shortly recall the main idea of the batalin ",
    "vilkovisky formalism in the general setting of [ secbv ] . for any function @xmath213 ,",
    "the `` gauge fixing fermion '' , of the fields of ghost number @xmath214 , one considers the integral @xmath215 for an observable @xmath216 , i.e. , a function of fields and antifields which is closed with respect to the quantum brst operator @xmath217 : @xmath218 the integral is taken over the `` lagrangian '' submanifold @xmath25 defined by the equations @xmath219 . using formally the master equation and the fact that @xmath216 is brst closed , one then see that these integrals are invariant under variations of @xmath213 and thus `` equal '' to the original ( ill - defined ) path integral with action @xmath142={s_{\\mathrm{bv}}}[\\phi,0]$ ] , which is what one gets if @xmath220 .",
    "the problem is then to find a function @xmath213 which makes the integral well - defined , at least as a perturbative series .",
    "one way to do this is to add new fields , called antighosts and lagrange multipliers together with their antifields , and choose @xmath213 as the scalar product of the antighost and the gauge fixing condition .",
    "the action for these new fields is the simplest and is added to the batalin ",
    "vilkovisky action @xmath143 .",
    "let us do this in the case at hand .",

    "the boundary condition for @xmath221 was chosen so as to fulfill the boundary condition for @xmath178 ( vanishing on normal vectors ) .",
