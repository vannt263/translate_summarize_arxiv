    "in the current paper we prove several qualitative features of the pressure function in an extreme stokes wave over infinite depth .",
    "extreme stokes waves , or the stokes wave of greatest height , are defined by the appearance of a stagnation point at the wave crest .",
    "the presence of a stagnation point at the wave - crest of an extreme stokes wave introduces a number of mathematical difficulties resulting in the irregularity of the free surface profile @xcite .",
    "we circumvent this difficulty by excising the stagnation points and then employing a uniform limiting process .",
    "we use recent results concerning the velocity field in deep - water extreme stokes waves which were obtained by the author in @xcite , and which generalise analogous results for regular deep - water stokes waves in @xcite .",
    "a stokes wave is a surface gravity wave , characterised by a steady , periodic , irrotational flow symmetric about the crest - line , propagating in an incompressible and inviscid fluid . in the work",
    "@xcite stokes conjectured the existence of a more exotic species of such waves , incorporating a stagnation point at the wave crest , where the fluid velocity is @xmath0 in the moving frame , the frame which moves with the wave speed @xmath1 .",
    "the existence of the wave of greatest height as a steady , periodic two - dimensional flow in deep - water , was established in the work @xcite by means of sequences of regular stokes waves tending to the extreme stokes wave . the work of amick et al .",
    "@xcite established the regularity of the free surface profile between successive crests for these extreme stokes waves along with proving the conjecture of stokes that these wave crests contain an angle of opening of @xmath2 .",
    "the analytical approaches of these contributions rely heavily on the irrotationality of the flow the incorporation of the effects of vorticity require alternative approaches and formulations cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "mathematically and experimentally the properties of the pressure profile throughout a fluid body are of interest for several reasons , for example the pressure within a fluid body plays a significant role in governing particle trajectories therein , cf .",
    "@xcite for some recent results concerning particle trajectories in regular stokes waves .",
    "while there are many papers which address the pressure profile beneath stokes waves , few are concerned with the exact nonlinear theory of the flow . nevertheless , the recent works @xcite and @xcite have established the qualitative behaviour of the pressure from the fully nonlinear governing equations for regular stokes waves in finite and infinite depth respectively . the pressure profile for surface waves of small amplitude such as those arising as solutions of the kdv equation may be found in @xcite , while numerical and experimental results for nonlinear surface gravity waves are presented in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "measurements of the fluid velocity and pressure beneath ocean surface waves are crucial to the design of cost - effective offshore structures ( see @xcite where predictions of the forces exerted on offshore cylindrical structures are compared with those predicted by linear models of surface wind waves ) .",
    "in addition , given the practical applications relating the pressure measurements in water waves over finite depth to the surface profiles of these flows ( see @xcite for some recent results this regard ) , the pressure profile of deep - water flows is also a practical subject worthy of further study .",
    "indeed , while pressure measurements are typically taken from pressure transducers which are lain along the sea - bed , this has some practical drawbacks due to the complex dynamics of the bottom boundary layer .",
    "an alternative approach which is sometimes employed is to instead use transducers suspended at a fixed - depth beneath the free - surface .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate the pressure profile of the fully nonlinear model for extreme stokes waves over infinite depth .",
    "it will be shown that the pressure is strictly decreasing between a crest - line and subsequent trough - line within the fluid body , except along the crest - line and trough - line themselves , where the pressure is stationary with respect to the horizontal coordinate . likewise , along the free surface it will be shown that the pressure is strictly decreasing as we move horizontally between a wave crest and subsequent wave trough , except at the crest and trough themselves , where yet again the pressure is stationary in the horizontal direction .",
    "lastly , it will be shown that the pressure is a strictly increasing function of depth at all points throughout the fluid domain .",
    "in section [ sec2 ] we present the governing equations and associated boundary conditions describing the two - dimensional fluid flow and discuss some a priori features of the velocity field and free surface profile inherent to stokes waves . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we introduce the hodograph transform by means of a pair of conformal maps , namely the stream function and the velocity potential .",
    "while the hodograph transform is conformal almost everywhere in the fluid domain , the presence of a stagnation point at the wave crest means the map is no longer regular at that point , a difficulty that will be overcome in this paper . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we present some results concerning the velocity field throughout the fluid domain , which in turn will be used in section [ sec5 ] to prove that the pressure decreases between any crest - line and subsequent trough - line , except along these lines themselves .",
    "additionally it will be shown that the pressure is strictly increasing with depth at all points throughout the fluid .",
    "stokes waves are steady , periodic flows , which move with fixed speed , @xmath1 say , with respect to the physical frame whose coordinates we denote by @xmath3 .",
    "since the flow is steady , it is always possible to construct a reference frame moving relative to the physical frame in which the wave form is fixed , namely the moving frame .",
    "the points of the moving frame are labelled with coordinates @xmath4 , while the transformation between the physical frame and the moving frame coordinates is given by @xmath5 in this frame of reference the wave profile appears fixed and consequently the governing equations for the fluid flow depend on time implicity , and are written according to @xmath6 in @xmath7 , the interior of the fluid domain . here and throughout it is to be understood that the @xmath8 and @xmath9 are functions of the @xmath10-variables .",
    "the associated boundary conditions are given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and the constant @xmath13 denotes the atmospheric pressure exerted on the free surface by the air column above . throughout this paper",
    "we consider stokes waves as irrotational flows in an ideal fluid ( incompressible , inviscid ) in the absence of surface tension . as such",
    "we also require that the fluid velocity satisfy @xmath14 which ensure incompressibility and irrotationality respectively .",
    "we note that the incompressibility and irrotationality conditions simultaneously imposed on either @xmath15 or @xmath16 ensure that both components of the velocity field are harmonic in @xmath17 , that is to say @xmath18 being periodic in the horizontal direction , stokes waves have an associated wavelength which is defined to be the distance between two successive wave crests and which we set as @xmath19 without loss of generality . in the moving frame a wave - crest will be fixed at the location @xmath20 with wave - troughs at @xmath21 .",
    "therefore the horizontal fluid velocity @xmath15 , the surface profile @xmath22 and the pressure @xmath9 are all symmetric about @xmath23 , while the function @xmath22 is also convex for @xmath24 $ ] , cf .",
    "meanwhile the vertical fluid velocity @xmath16 is odd with respect to @xmath25 . as such",
    "we need only consider the behaviour of these functions in a semi - infinite strip of width @xmath26 , namely @xmath27 , and we define @xmath28 the regions @xmath29 are bounded above by the free surface sections given by @xmath30 periodicity and ( anti)symmetry of the functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath22 , @xmath9 will allow us to extend our considerations in @xmath31 throughout the fluid domain @xmath32 .    in the case of regular , periodic , steady waves that are not near breaking , we have @xmath33 at the wave crest , cf . @xcite .",
    "thus for regular stokes waves we always have @xmath34 with the harmonic function @xmath15 attaining its maximum at the wave - crest . in an extreme stokes wave , where we have @xmath35 at the wave - crest , forming a so called stagnation point ( although see @xcite for a discussion of the fluid particle behaviour at the stagnation point ) , relation becomes a non - strict inequality @xmath36 with equality achieved at the wave - cusp cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the presence of a stagnation point on the free surface presents a number of mathematical difficulties when we try to impose maximum principles on the velocity field @xmath37 .",
    "however a recently developed approach @xcite has allowed us to circumvent these difficulties by applying maximum principles in an excised domain .",
    "we then analyse the dynamical variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 and @xmath9 in a domain with the offending stagnation point removed , and obtain corresponding results for extreme stokes waves by way of a uniform limiting process .",
    "from the incompressibility of the fluid flow we may introduce a stream function @xmath38 defined by @xmath39 where the irrotationality of the fluid flow , cf .",
    "equation , also ensures that the stream function @xmath38 is harmonic throughout the fluid domain .",
    "integrating equations and using the symmetry properties of the velocity field , the stream function is found to be periodic in the @xmath25-variable .",
    "furthermore upon integrating equation the euler equation may be equivalently written as bernoulli s law which is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is constant throughout the fluid domain @xmath32 .",
    "bernoulli s law evaluated along the free surface allows us to reformulate the free boundary problem presented in equations  according to @xmath42 where we introduce @xmath43 which is constant throughout @xmath32 .",
    "in addition to the stream function , the irrotationality of the flow also ensures the existence of a velocity potential defined by @xmath44 the incompressibility condition , cf .",
    "equation , ensures that the velocity potential is also harmonic in the fluid domain , while integrating and imposing the symmetries of the velocity field , we deduce that the function @xmath45 is @xmath46-periodic in the horizontal direction .",
    "having defined a pair of harmonic conjugates , we now use @xmath47 and @xmath38 to construct the conformal map @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 the so called hodograph transform @xcite . under this coordinate transformation",
    ", the domain @xmath17 whose boundary is the free surface , transforms to the domain @xmath51 whose boundary is simply a horizontal line , hence transforming between an unknown domain and a fixed domain .",
    "the images of the interior regions @xmath52 are given by @xmath53 meanwhile the image of the free surface sections @xmath54 are given by @xmath55 the hodograph transform between the fluid domain and the conformal domain is illustrated in figure [ hodo ] :    we introduce the height function @xmath56 , such that @xmath57 we note that since @xmath58 is harmonic in the @xmath10-variables and the coordinate transformation is conformal in the interior of @xmath59 then @xmath58 is also harmonic in the @xmath60-variables .",
    "we employ @xmath58 and bernoulli s law , cf .",
    "equation , to reformulate the free boundary problem given by equation in the conformal domain @xmath51 , as follows @xmath61 the function @xmath58 is even and periodic with respect to @xmath62 with a period of @xmath63 .",
    "the transformation between the moving frame coordinates @xmath10 and the conformal coordinates @xmath60 is given by the following relations : @xmath64 with @xmath65",
    "in the analysis which follows , it will be necessary to apply maximum principles in the conformal domain @xmath66 .",
    "however , the fact that the closure of this domain harbours a stagnation point at @xmath67 means the velocity field does not possess the necessary regularity to impose the strong maximum principle and hopf s maximum principle to @xmath15 and @xmath16 in any neighbourhood of the wave crest . nevertheless , in line with the methods developed in @xcite it is possible to apply these maximum principles in the excised conformal domain @xmath68 illustrated in figure [ excisedregion ] :    by means of the uniform limiting process outlined below , we extend these results to the region @xmath66 and hence @xmath69 also .",
    "we define @xmath70 and note that there is a sequence @xmath71 of regular stokes waves which converges weakly to @xmath72 in the sobolev space @xmath73 , for @xmath74 , cf .",
    "consequently this sequence of regular stokes waves approaches the extreme wave in the hlder space @xmath75 with @xmath76 , cf .",
    "we introduce the variable @xmath77 and the function @xmath78 which is analytic in @xmath66 and continuous on the boundary @xmath79 .",
