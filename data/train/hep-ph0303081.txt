    "measurements of solar and atmospheric neutrinos have provided strong evidence for non - zero neutrino masses and mixing @xcite .",
    "atmospheric results have been further strengthened by the k2k collaboration s accelerator based results @xcite .",
    "the solar neutrino results have been confirmed by the kamland collaboration in a reactor based experiment that has shown that the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution is most likely the correct one @xcite .",
    "interpretation of the experimental results is based on oscillations of one neutrino flavor state , @xmath8 or @xmath9 , into the others , and described quantum mechanically in terms of neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the mass squared differences involved in the transitions are measured to be approximately @xmath12 for the solar neutrinos and @xmath13 for the atmospheric neutrinos , with large mixing strengths , @xmath14 and @xmath15 in both cases .",
    "these existing data on neutrino oscillations@xcite and the prospect of searching for cp violation make clear that the next generation of oscillation experiments must be significantly more ambitious than before . in particular",
    ", the source of neutrinos needs to be accelerator based so that both the neutrino flavor content and the energy spectrum of the initial state can be selected .",
    "several approaches have been explored in the literature .",
    "these involve either a narrow band `` off - axis '' beam produced with a conventional magnetic focusing system @xcite or a neutrino factory based on a muon storage ring @xcite . in this paper , we show that the currently favored parameters open the possibility for an accelerator based very long baseline ( bvlb ) experiment that can explore both solar and atmospheric oscillation parameters in a single experiment , complete the measurement of the mixing parameters , and search for new physics .",
    "there are four measurements of primary interest that can be addressed with the experimental arrangement described in this paper . using the parameter convention described in @xcite , they are :    1 .",
    "\\(i ) definitive observation of oscillatory behavior ( multiple oscillations ) in the @xmath16 disappearance mode and precise determination of the oscillation parameters @xmath4 and @xmath17 , with statistical errors @xmath18 .",
    "\\(ii ) detection of the oscillation @xmath19 in the appearance mode and measurement of the parameter @xmath20",
    ". this will involve matter enhancement and also allow definitive measurement of the sign of @xmath4 , i.e. , which neutrino @xmath11 or @xmath21 is heavier .",
    "\\(iii ) measurement of the cp violation parameter , @xmath0 , in the lepton sector .",
    "\\(iv ) measurement of @xmath6 in the appearance channel of @xmath7 .",
    "we describe how these measurements could be carried out with good precision in a single accelerator based experiment . for precise and definitive measurement of oscillations",
    "we must observe multiple oscillation nodes in the energy spectrum of reconstructed muon and electron neutrino charged current events .",
    "the multiple node signature is also necessary in order to distinguish between oscillations and other more exotic explanations such as neutrino decay @xcite or extra dimensions @xcite for the muon neutrino deficit in atmospheric neutrinos . since the cross - section , fermi motion , and nuclear effects limit the statistics and the energy resolution ( for reconstructed neutrino energy ) of low energy charged current events , we use neutrinos with energies greater than few hundred mev and clean events with a single visible muon or electron that are dominated by quasielastic scattering , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes a lepton .",
    "figure [ nodes ] shows that the distance needed to observe at least 3 nodes in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum is greater than 2000 km for @xmath24 , the currently favored value from super - kamiokande atmospheric data @xcite",
    ". a baseline of longer than 2000 km coupled with a wide band beam with high flux from 0.5 to 6 gev will provide a nodal pattern in the @xmath25 disappearance channel and good sensitivity over a broad range of @xmath4 .    .",

    "the low energy wide band beam and the very long baseline also have a number of important advantages for the appearance channel of @xmath32 .",
    "these advantages can be summarized using figure [ app1 ] which shows the probability of @xmath7 oscillation as a function of neutrino energy for the distance of 2540 km , the distance between bnl and the homestake mine in south dakota .",
    "the oscillation parameters that we have assumed are indicated in the figure and the caption .",
    "we define the natural mass ordering ( _ no _ ) of neutrinos to be @xmath33 , and the other two possibilities ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) are collectively called reversed ordering ( _ ro _ ) . both _",
    "ro _ possibilities have very similar physical consequences , but @xmath35 is strongly disfavored by the explanation of the solar neutrino deficit using matter enhanced neutrino oscillation ( the lma solution ) . since neutrinos from an accelerator beam must pass through the earth to arrive at a detector located 2540 km away , the probability in figure [ app1 ] includes the effects of matter , which enhance ( suppress ) the probability above 3.0 gev for _ no _ ( _ ro _ ) @xcite .",
    "therefore the appearance probability above 3.0 gev is sensitive to both the mass ordering and the parameter @xmath36 .",
    "the probability in the region 1.0 to 3.0 gev is less sensitive to matter but much more sensitive to the cp phase @xmath0 as shown in figure [ app1]@xcite .",
    "the increase in the probability below 1.5 gev is due to the presence of terms involving the solar oscillation parameters , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of electron neutrino events measured with a wide band beam over 2540  km with sufficiently low background has the potential to determine @xmath39 , @xmath0 , and the mass ordering of neutrinos as well as @xmath37 because these parameters affect different regions of the energy spectrum . in the following ,",
    "we examine how well the parameters can be determined and the implications for the detector performance and background .",
    "the high energy proton accelerator , to be used for making the neutrino beam , must be intense ( @xmath40 1 mw in power ) to provide sufficient neutrino - induced event rates in a massive detector very distant from it .",
    "such a long baseline experimental arrangement @xcite may be realized with a neutrino beam from the upgraded 28 gev proton beam from the alternating gradient synchrotron at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) and a water cherenkov detector with 0.5 megaton of fiducial mass at either the homestake mine in south dakota or the waste isolation pilot plant ( wipp ) in new mexico , at distances @xmath402540 km and @xmath402900 km from bnl , respectively .",
    "a version of the detector is described at length in @xcite and is a candidate for location in the homestake mine , where it would occupy five independent cavities , each about 100 kton in fiducial volume .",
    "another version of the detector in a single volume is described in @xcite . for much of the discussion below",
    "we have used the distance of 2540 km to homestake for our calculations . although the statistics obtained at 2900 km to wipp will be somewhat smaller , many of the physics effects will be larger , and therefore the resolution and the physics reach of the bvlb experiment are approximately independent of the choice between homestake or wipp .",
    "the accelerator upgrade as well as the issues regarding the production target and horn system are described in @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe it here for completeness .",
    "currently , the bnl - ags can accelerate @xmath41 protons upto 28 gev approximately every 2 sec .",
    "this corresponds to average beam power of about 0.16 mw .",
    "this average power could be upgraded by increasing the repetition rate of the ags synchrotron to 2.5 hz while keeping the number of protons per pulse approximately the same .",
    "currently a 200 mev room temperature linac in combination with a small synchrotron , called the booster , injects protons into the ags at 1.2 gev .",
    "the process of collecting sufficient number of protons from the booster into the ags takes about 0.6 sec .",
    "therefore , for 2.5 hz operation the booster must be replaced by a new injector .",
    "a new super - conducting linac to replace the booster could serve the role of a new injector ; the remaining modifications to the ags are well understood and they involve power supplies , the rf system , and other rate dependent systems to make the accelerator ramp up and down at 2.5 hz .",
    "we expect the final upgraded accelerator configuration to yield @xmath42 protons every 400 ms at 28 gev .",
    "our studies show that this intensity can be further upgraded to 2 mw by incremental improvements to the linac and the ags repetition rate .",
    "in addition to the 1 mw accelerator upgrade , the pion production target , the horn focusing system , and the decay tunnel , which must be aimed at an angle of 11.26 degrees into the earth ( towards homestake ) need to be built .",
    "our current studies indicate that a carbon - carbon composite target inserted into a conventional aluminum horn cooled with forced helium and water will function in the 1 mw beam for a sufficient length of time .",
    "our current plan is to build a hill instead of an underground tunnel to accommodate the 200 m long pion decay tunnel .",
    "we consider both the rapid cycling accelerator upgrade which maintains a relatively low intensity per pulse and the 1 mw capable target technically less risky than other alternatives . for comparison , at jparc @xcite",
    "the first ( preliminary ) stage of 0.75 mw is to be achieved at @xmath40 1/3 hz with @xmath43 protons per pulse at 50 gev . at fermilab",
    "a 2 mw upgrade to the 120 gev main injector calls for either an 8 gev super - conducting linac or a new rapid cycling proton synchrotron as injectors for the main injector@xcite . as explained in the following ,",
    "the combination of the very long baseline and a 500 kt detector allows the bvlb experiment to use a lower average power at 1 mw compared to the proposed jparc or numi(off axis ) @xcite projects and achieve wider physics goals .",
    "this reduces the technical difficulties ( liquid mercury or moving targets , radiation damage , shielding of personnel , etc . )",
    "associated with using beam powers in excess of 1 mw .",
    "we have performed detailed simulations of a wide band horn focused neutrino beam using 1 mw of 28 gev protons on a graphite target .",
    "the neutrino spectrum obtained in these simulations and used for the results in this paper is shown in figure [ nuspec ] normalized for pot ( protons on target ) .",
    "we calculate that with such a beam ( total intensity of @xmath44 at distance of 1 km from the target ) we will obtain about 60,000 charged current and 20,000 neutral current events in a total exposure lasting @xmath45 seconds in a 0.5 megaton water cherenkov detector located at the homestake mine 2540 km away from bnl . for the results reported below",
    ", we use the particle spectra obtained by making cuts to select single muon or electron quasielastic events .",
    "events with multiple particles ( about 4 times higher in statistics ) could be used to further enhance the statistical significance of the effects .",
    "a conventional horn focused beam can be run in either the neutrino or the anti - neutrino mode . in this paper",
    "we show that most of the physics program in the case of 3-generation mixing can be carried out by taking data in the neutrino mode alone .",
    "it is well known that experiments that must take data with anti - neutrinos , which have lower cross section , must run for long times to accumulate sufficient statistics @xcite .",
    "this problem is largely alleviated in our method .",

    "energies lower than @xmath49 gev , the @xmath16 energy resolution will be dominated by fermi motion and nuclear effects , as illustrated in figure [ nodes ] .",
    "the contribution to the resolution from water cherenkov track reconstruction depends in first approximation on the photo - multiplier tube coverage . with",
    "coverage greater than 10% , a reconstruction energy resolution of better than @xmath50 should be achieved @xcite .",
    "the simulated spectrum of the expected @xmath16 disappearance signal including backgrounds and resolution is shown in figure [ wcnodesa ] for @xmath51 as a function of reconstructed neutrino energy .",
    "the background , which will be primarily charged current events , will also oscillate and broaden the dips in the nodal pattern . from this spectrum",
    "we estimate that the determination of @xmath52 will have a statistical uncertainty of approximately @xmath53% at @xmath54 and @xmath55 . the experiment can determine @xmath56 at 90% confidence level .",
    "within the parameter region of interest there will be little correlation in the determination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the precision of the experiment is compared in figure [ cntr ] with the precision expected from minos @xcite and the result from super - kamiokande @xcite .",
    "since the statistics and the size of the expected signal ( distortion of the spectrum ) are both large in the disappearance measurement , we expect that the final error on the parameters will be dominated by the systematic error .",
    "a great advantage of the very long baseline and multiple oscillation pattern in the spectrum is that the effect of systematic errors on flux normalization , background subtraction , and spectrum distortion due to nuclear effects or detector calibration is small .",
    "the error on the overall detector energy scale is expected to be the dominant systematic error @xcite .",
    "the large event rate in this experiment will allow us to measure @xmath4 precisely in a short period of time ; this measurement will be important to predict the shape of the appearance signal which we now discuss .",
    "the importance of matter effects on long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments has been recognized for many years @xcite . for our study , we have included the effect of matter with a full numerical calculation taking into account a realistic matter profile in the earth , following @xcite . for our present discussion ,",
    "it is useful to exhibit an approximate analytic formula for the oscillation of @xmath7 for 3-generation mixing obtained with the simplifying assumption of constant matter density @xcite .",
    "assuming a constant matter density , the oscillation of @xmath19 in the earth for 3-generation mixing is described approximately by equation [ qe1 ] . in this equation @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",

    "nevertheless , the approximate formula is useful for understanding important features of the appearance probability : 1 ) the first 3 terms in the equation control the enhancement ( for _ no _ ) or suppression ( for _ ro _ ) of the oscillation probability above 3 gev ; 2 ) the second and third terms control the sensitivity to cp in the intermediate 1 to 3 gev range ; and 3 ) the last term controls the sensitivity to @xmath37 at low energies .     and @xmath5 for the 2540 baseline experiment ; assuming 1 mw , 0.5 mt , and @xmath71 sec of exposure .",

    "the @xmath73 signal will consist of clean , single electron events ( single showering rings in a water cherenkov detector ) that result mostly from the quasielastic reaction @xmath74 .",
    "the main backgrounds will be from the electron neutrino contamination in the beam and reactions that have a @xmath75 in the final state .",
    "the @xmath75 background will depend on how well the detector can distinguish events with single electron induced and two photon induced electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "backgrounds due to @xmath76 conversion , @xmath77 charged current reactions in the detector , and subsequent @xmath78 decays are small because of the low energy of the beam and the consequent low cross section for @xmath79 production @xcite .",
    "because of the rapid fall in the bvlb neutrino spectrum beyond 4 gev ( figure [ nuspec ] ) , the largest contribution to the @xmath75 background will come from neutral current events with a single @xmath75 in the final state .",
    "it is well known that resonant single pion production in neutrino reactions has a rapidly falling cross section as a function of momentum transfer , @xmath80 , @xcite up to the kinematically allowed value .",
    "this characteristic alone suppresses this background by more than 2 orders of magnitude for @xmath75 ( or shower ) energies above 2 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore a modest @xmath75 background suppression ( by a factor of @xmath3 below 2 gev and @xmath402 above 2 gev ) is sufficient to reduce the @xmath75 background to manageable level over the entire spectrum .",
    "the electron neutrino contamination in the beam from decays of muons and kaons , is well understood to be 0.7% of the muon neutrino flux @xcite , with a similar spectrum ( figure [ nuspec ] ) .",
    "the experimentally observed electron neutrino energy spectrum will therefore have three components : the rapidly falling shape of the @xmath75 background , the spectral shape of the @xmath81 beam contamination slightly modified by oscillation , and the oscillatory shape of the appearance signal .",
    "the shape of the appearance spectrum will be well known because of the precise knowledge of @xmath4 from the disappearance measurement as well as the improved knowledge of @xmath82 from kamland @xcite .",

    "the parameters assumed are listed in the figure as well as the caption .",
    "figure [ app2 ] further illustrates the previously described three regions of the appearance spectrum : the high energy region ( @xmath83 gev ) with a matter enhanced ( for _ no _ ) appearance has the main contribution to the background from @xmath81 contamination in the beam ; the intermediate region ( @xmath84 gev ) with high sensitivity to the cp phase , but little dependance on mass ordering , has approximately equal contribution from both background sources ( @xmath81 and @xmath75 ) ; and the low energy region ( @xmath85 gev ) , where the effects of the cp phase and @xmath86 dominate , has the main background from the @xmath75 events .",
    "matter enhancement of the oscillations has been postulated for a long time without experimental confirmation @xcite .",
    "detection of such an effect by observing a matter enhanced peak around 3 gev will be important .",
    "however , in the case of _ ro _ mass ordering this enhanced peak will be missing , but the effect ( depending on @xmath0 ) on the rest of the electron neutrino spectrum will be small .",

    "the lma - i and lma - ii solutions with their respective confidence levels are discussed in @xcite .",
    "this measurement will be sensitive to the magnitude and knowledge of the background because there will be no oscillating signature to distinguish the signal .",
    "we estimate that the statistical and systematic errors on this measurement will allow us to determine the combination @xmath90 to a precision of about 10% at the lma best fit point .",
    "this is competitive with the expected measurement from kamland .",
    "however , it will be done in the explicit ( @xmath7 ) appearance mode , which is qualitatively different from the measurements made so far in the sno or the kamland experiments .",

    "the statistical sensitivity ( approximately proportional to the square root of the event rate ) to the effects of cp violation , therefore , is independent of distance because the loss of event rate and the increase of the cp effect approximately cancel each other in the statistical merit if backgrounds remain the same .",
    "therefore , the two important advantages of the bvlb approach are that the cp effect can be detected without running in the anti - neutrino mode and the sensitivity to systematic errors on the background and the normalization is considerably reduced because the fractional size of the cp effect is large .",

    "the alternatives to the bvlb plan fall into two categories : experiments with conventional horn focused beams over baselines of several hundred km and with beams based on neutrinos from muon decays in a high intensity muon storage ring . for a recent review of muon storage ring based neutrino factory physics as well as comparisons to conventional neutrinos beams",
    "see @xcite .",
    "recently , for the conventional beam an `` off - axis '' beam is preferred because the energy spectrum is narrower and can be tuned , within a limited range from 1 to 2 gev by choosing the off - axis angle @xcite .",
    "a narrow energy spectrum could be better suited for identifying @xmath7 conversion because the neutral current backgrounds from interactions of high energy neutrinos are lowered .",
    "the jparc to super kamiokande project ( baseline of 295 km ) has adapted this strategy and a new initiative at fermilab based on the numi beamline ( baseline of 732 km ) is also considering it @xcite . both of these projects focus on the observation of a non - zero value for @xmath1 . since it is not possible to eliminate the @xmath400.5% @xmath81 contamination in a conventional @xmath127 beam ( even if it is `` off - axis '' )",
    "the sensitivity of all projects based on a conventional beam , including the bvlb plan , is limited to @xmath128 ( ignoring the effect of @xmath0 ) .",
    "sensitivity below this value is background limited and requires very good understanding of the systematic errors associated with the purity of the beam .",
    "the bvlb plan does , however , extend this sensitivity to values of @xmath129 down to 0.001 @xmath130 .",
    "the `` off - axis '' projects must be upgraded to several megawatts of beam power and detectors of several hundred kt ( the second phase of the jparc project calls for 4 mw beam and a 1 megaton detector ) to perform the cp measurement .",
    "the narrow band nature of the beam requires running in the anti - neutrino mode to observe cp violation .",
    "the bvlb plan uses a wide band beam over a much longer distance to achieve the same sensitivity to @xmath20 over a wider range of @xmath4 .",
    "it also has the ability to see a multiple node structure in both the disappearance and appearance channel ; thus making the observation of @xmath7 experimentally more robust against unanticipated backgrounds .",
    "in addition , the unique aspect of the wide band beam over the very long baseline is the ability to measure @xmath0 with few ambiguities using neutrino data alone .    the muon storage ring based `` neutrino factory '' solves the background problem faced with conventional beams .",
    "a @xmath131 and a @xmath81 is produced in each @xmath132 decay .",
    "an appearance search looks for the conversion of @xmath81 into @xmath127 by looking for events with negatively charged @xmath133 particles in the presence of @xmath131 charged current events with positively charged @xmath132 particles in the final state .",
    "such a physics signature should potentially have very low background .",
    "therefore , a neutrino factory based @xmath134 search is estimated to be sensitive to @xmath20 perhaps as small as @xmath135 .",
    "such a facility is very well tuned for measurement of @xmath20 .",
    "nevertheless , because of the relatively narrow energy spectrum and higher energy of the neutrino factory , it lacks the ability to observe multiple nodes in the observed spectrum .",
    "for the neutrino factory the effects of cp violation are observed by comparing @xmath136 and @xmath137 in two different runs of @xmath133 and @xmath133 decays in the presence of very large matter effects .",
    "the narrow spectrum also limits the ability of the neutrino factory to resolve the ambiguities in the @xmath0 determination regardless of the value of @xmath36 .",
    "this has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite and one of the proposed solutions is to construct several detectors with different baselines to uniquely determine @xmath0 versus @xmath36 .",
    "although the neutrino factory can extend the reach for @xmath36 to very small values because the backgrounds to the appearance search are small , the resolution on @xmath0  disregarding the ambiguities inherent in the neutrino factory approach  is comparable to the bvlb resolution .",
    "we therefore conclude , that if @xmath138 the bvlb experiment is either equal to or exceeds the physics reach for neutrino mixing parameters of the neutrino factory .",
    "other suggestions in the literature include @xmath81 or @xmath139 beams from either decays of radioactive nuclei accelerated to high energies ( beta - beam ) @xcite or @xmath139 s from nuclear power generation reactors such as the beam used for kamland @xcite .",
    "both of these concepts aim to create very pure , but low energy beams . for cp sensitivity",
    "both @xmath81 and @xmath139 must be produced in separate runs in the beta - beam concept .",
    "the low background should enable the beta - beam concept to have good sensitivity to @xmath1 , if sufficient flux can be obtained .",
    "the reactor beams are below @xmath127 charged current reaction threshold and therefore must rely on disappearance to search for a non - zero value of @xmath1 . a disappearance based search for @xmath1",
    "will most likely be limited by systematic errors .",
    "further comments on these techniques must await more detailed studies .",
    "we have simulated and analyzed a feasible , very long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment consisting of a low energy , wide band neutrino beam produced by 1 mw of 28 gev protons incident on a carbon target with magnetic horn focusing of pions and kaons , and a 500 kt detector at a distance of @xmath140 2500 km from the neutrino source .",
    "the bvlb neutrino beam with a total intensity of about @xmath141 at a distance of 1 km from the target could be provided by an upgrade to the bnl - ags @xcite .",
    "the single bvlb experiment could produce measurements of all parameters in the neutrino mixing matrix through observation of the disappearance channel , @xmath142 and the appearance channel , @xmath19 .",
    "the experiment is also sensitive to the mass ordering of neutrinos using the observation of the matter effect in the appearance channel through the currently unknown parameter @xmath36 .",
    "nevertheless , the experiment is intended primarily to measure the strength of cp  invariance violation in the neutrino sector and will provide a measurement of the cp  phase , @xmath0 or alternatively the cp  violating quantity , @xmath143 , if the one currently unknown neutrino oscillation mixing parameter @xmath2 , a value about 15 times lower than the present experimental upper limit .",
    "we point out that for a given resolution on @xmath0 the number of neutrino events needed which determines the detector size and beam intensity , is approximately independent of the baseline as well as the value of @xmath144 as long as the electron signal is not background dominated .",
    "therefore , the concept of very long baseline ( @xmath145 ) is attractive because it provides access to much richer physics phenomena as well as reduces the need to understand systematic errors on the flux normalization and background determination .",
    "a shorter baseline ( @xmath146 ) will obviously limit the reach of the experiment for @xmath147 in the appearance mode as well as reduce the resolution on the cp parameter . on the other hand",
    ", a much longer baseline ( @xmath148 ) will result in a matter effect that is large enough to dominate the spectrum and make the extraction of the cp  effect more difficult .",
    "the larger distance will also make it necessary to make the neutrino beam directed at a higher angle into the earth , a technical challenge that may not be necessary given the current values of neutrino parameters .",
    "lastly , we have also shown that most of this rich physics program including the search for cp  effects can be carried out by neutrino running alone .",
    "once cp  effects are established with neutrino data , anti - neutrino data could be obtained for more precision on the parameters or search for new physics .",
    "the shape of the disappearance signal over multiple oscillations from neutrino running alone ( as well as in combination with anti - neutrino running ) can be used to contrain effects of new physics from : sterile neutrino mixing , extra dimensions , exotic interactions with matter , etc .",
    "it has not escaped our notice that the large detector size ( @xmath149500 kt ) , mandated by the above described neutrino program , naturally lends itself to the important physics of proton decay , supernova detection , etc .",
    "although some experimental requirements such as shielding from cosmic rays , detector shape , or photo - sensor coverage , may differ , it is clear that they can be resolved so that this large detector can also be employed to address these frontier physics issues .",
