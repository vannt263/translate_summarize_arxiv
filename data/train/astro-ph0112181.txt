    "@xcite ) , some residual flux is visible on the bottom of the lyman lines , as one can see in figures  [ fig_spectre_all ] and  [ fig_spectre_lines ] .",
    "this residual flux ( at a level of few percent of the continuum ) is probably due to the scatter of adjacent flux from the continuum due to the wings of the lsf .",
    "this interpretation agrees with the fact that this small amount of flux is not detected at wavelengths lower than the lyman break , where there is no flux for scatter .",
    "since the residual flux is so low , for each spectral window we tuned the zero flux level to the signal at the core of the nearest lyman line , where it is readily measurable because these lines are totally saturated .",
    "the diffuse light is a few percent of the continuum , and its variations as a function of wavelength seem to be of the same order of magnitude , or even lower .",

    "error bars were computed from an analysis of the  variation .",
    "we pegged that parameter at various trial values , and for each trial value we ran an extra fit , allowing all the other parameters to vary freely .",

    ", we obtained the value of  as a function of this parameter , and we derived the 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and @xmath39 error bars using the standard method .",
    "the error bars at these different confidence levels have been taken into account to produce the final  uncertainties reported here .",
    "the  curves as a function of column density are plotted in figure  [ fig_chi2_don ] .",
    "however , since our best fit  value lies far above what would be expected for the corresponding number of degrees of freedom , and since that change is due to inaccurate estimates of the noise array , we rescaled our  and the corresponding  values in the following way . at the 95% confidence level ,",
    "the smallest value that one can draw from a  distribution with 1764 degrees of freedom is 1667.5 , and consequently we increase the noise variance on each pixel by a factor @xmath40 ( 2424.2 corresponds to our best fit value ) , or equivalently we divide our  and  by a factor 1.45 .",
    "note that this is the most conservative choice at the 95% confidence level for the rescaling parameter .",
    "for example , for the @xmath41 contour in one should now look for differences @xmath42 using our original error array , which corresponds to the standard @xmath43 for the correctly rescaled error array .",
    "this rescaling , similar to that presented by lemoine et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , has increased in a conservative way the error bars derived  below .",
    "our column densities measurements are reported in table  [ table_results ] .",
    "we derived the following abundance ratios :    @xmath44    @xmath45    with  error bars .",
    "these error bars were computed from the individual errors on the column densities listed in table  [ table_results ] , assuming that they are uncorrelated . although the noise may not follow a gaussian distribution , we checked on smooth parts of the spectrum that the tabulated error bars scaled as described above ( sect .",
    "[ chi2_scaling ] ) effectively include more than 95% of the individual points of the spectrum .",
    "therefore , the quoted `` '' error bars can be considered as a 95% confidence level , statistic and systematic effects being taking into account ( see sect .  [ systematic_effects ] ) .",
    "a formal temperature and turbulent velocity measured through the fit are @xmath46k and @xmath47 .",
    "these values should be taken with caution because several velocity components may be present and the spectral lines are not resolved .",
    "it is also a combination between turbulent velocity and velocity dispersion of the possible different clouds .",
    "in addition , these values were obtained from fits of unsaturated lines , which are not very sensitive to temperature and turbulent velocity .    for a given channel ,",
    "the relative shifts between different spectral windows were found to be relatively constant , with a dispersion below 10  and a standard deviation of @xmath48  .",
    "shifts between spectral windows of different channels were larger ( up to 130  ) .",
    "the full widths at half maximum obtained were @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 pixels respectively for spectral windows from hirs , mdrs , and lwrs ( values are averages and standard deviations on all the corresponding windows ) .",
    "as expected , the spectral resolution is slightly higher for hirs than for mdrs and lwrs .",
    "all the widths found were in the range 8    13  pixels .",
    "note that for 14 spectral windows it was not possible to determine the lsf width because of the low signal - to - noise ratio ; in these cases , the width was tuned to that obtained in the adjacent spectral windows .",
    "error bars on column densities computed with the  method ( sect .",
    "[ chi2_scaling ] ) include statistical _ and _ many possible systematic effects .",
    "the statistical aspect is obvious since the statistical error on each pixel is taken into account in the  computation .",
    "several approaches were used in order to reduce systematic errors .",
    "some effects were treated as free parameters ( sect .  [ free_parameters ] ) .",
    "some systematic effects are likely to be decreased by fitting simultaneously several different lines for a given element .",
    "it is possible that some of these effects affect our fits but the use of numerous different lines for a given element ( see , for example , table  [ table_lines ] for , , and ) averages out any possible bias . in the same spirit ,",
    "effects which are totally or partially linked to instrumental effects are likely to be decreased by having data from multiple segments , multiple observations , and multiple slits fitted simultaneously .",
    "it is unlikely that one of these effects affect in the same manner a given line observed with what are essentially different instruments ( different segments are used , through different slits , on different parts of the detectors ) .",
    "finally , many possible systematic errors in the column density measurements are reduced by analyzing only unsaturated lines .",
    "we list here the possible systematic effects which are treated using these four approaches :    * free parameters : * * continuum ; * * spectral shifts ; * *  width . * simultaneous fit of several lines for a given element : * * line blending ; * * oscillator strengths uncertainty ; * * continuum ; * * zero flux level determination ; * *  effects ; * *  effects ; * * flux calibration ; * * wavelength calibration .",

    "we discuss all the effects we investigated and we present some tests that we carried out in order to check the reliability of the error bars .",
    "line blending with unknown interstellar , stellar , or airglow features may affect the fit .",
    "however , such features are not present systematically for all lines of a given element .",
    "one exception is the stellar lines , falling systematically near the interstellar lines .",
    "however , no absorption is seen in the  spectrum in the unblended lines at 1084.9  or  992.3 .",
    "oscillator strengths ( @xmath52 ) of lines are well known .",
    "however , this is not the case for some lines of other elements , such as or .",
    "if some @xmath52-values were found to be inaccurate , the fit of that line would stand out as a poor fit and the line would be rejected ( , @xmath53 ) .",
    "by fitting each line individually , we checked that each tabulated @xmath52-value is consistent with the others ( none of them present an abnormal tabulated @xmath52-value ) .",
    "the range in column densities from fits to the individual lines retained in the sample presented a @xmath54% dispersion around the value obtained with all the lines .",
    "maybe some oscillator strengths are slightly inaccurate , but these errors should be small and average out in the final result .",
    "the continua of the interstellar lines is given by the stellar continuum , possibly modified by instrumental effects ( for example , one can see in figure  [ fig_spectre_all ] the bump near @xmath55  on lif1 , which is due to an instrumental artifact ) . for each spectral window ,",
    "the continuum fitted by a polynomial is near the actual continuum but is probably not a perfect model .",
    "however , when the continuum is fitted independently for each line , in spectra obtained in each segment and each spectrograph aperture , it is unlikely that the average placement will be systematically higher or lower than the actual continuum .",
    "we tested the possible systematic effect of the degree @xmath56 of the polynomials by performing fits with values of @xmath56 ranging from 1 to 14 .",
    "column densities obtained were consistent within the  error bars .",
    "thus , there is no strong dependence of the fit on the degree of the polynomials used to fit the continua .    around the lines ,",
    "the continuum is affected by the blue wing of the lyman line . in order to check the continuum levels found using polynomial approximations to the wings of the lyman lines",
    ", we performed additional fits with voigt profiles used to describe the lines .",
    "the value of @xmath37 ( ) remained within the @xmath57 error bar , so we infer that continuum levels at the lines are not strongly dependent upon how the lines are modeled .",
    "we note that the column density is not constrained well by these fits since the lyman lines lie on the flat part of the curve of growth .    finally , we divided the spectra by the stellar model we computed ( sect .",
    "[ stellar_model ] ) ; fits of these normalized spectra produce column densities included within the  error  bars .",
    "thus , no significant systematic effect linked to the continuum was found .",
    "the zero flux level may be a function of wavelength .",
    "simultaneous fits of different lines of a given element average out possible inaccuracies in the zero flux level determined from the bottom of the lyman lines ( sect .",
    "[ zero_flux_level ] ) .",
    "we made extra fits in two extreme cases : doubling that correction ( increasing the zero flux level by comparison with the best fit ) and letting it remain zero .",
    "we also made fits where the zero flux level was a free parameter on each spectral window , with all windows fitted simultaneously .",
    "all these fits produced column density values again within the  error  bars .",
    "fixed - pattern noise is able to create false features that may artificially increase or decrease the intensity of an absorption line .",
    "the comparison of results for any single line , measured in different segments and apertures , allowed us to find lines affected by . in the final fit",
    ", no lines were found to be in strong disagreement with the other ones so these effects are small and average out in the fit .",
    "in addition to fitting all the data simultaneously as described above , we also made fits to partial subsets of the total dataset presented in table  [ table_obs ] .",
    "these subsets were chosen to find possible time - dependent effects , segment to segment , channel to channel or detector to detector differences , and slit ( hirs , mdrs , lwrs ) effects such as optical transmission , , and airglow contamination ( airglow intensity depends of the size of the aperture ) .",
    "all of the column densities found from these partial fits remained within the  error ranges , so no significant effects were found .",
    "as expected , error bars obtained with only one of these subsets of data were larger than the ones obtained with the complete dataset .",

    "this assumption may be incorrect if the species do not co - exist in the same regions along the sight line , which might be true if a significant amount of ionized gas is present . in order to test the possible systematic effect due to this assumption , we made extra fits including all these species but one .",

    "the robustness of this approach was tested on a simulated spectra made with a double gaussian lsf ; they were fitted with a simple gaussian lsf and a tuned zero flux level , and the result was satisfactory ( see below ) .",

    "the column densities are consistent within the  error bars .",
    "hence , no effects on column densities due to @xmath24 or @xmath25 are significant , as expected from the fact that only unsaturated lines are fit .",
    "fits were made assuming only one interstellar component on the line of sight , even if it is likely that several components are present along this @xmath66  pc sight line .",
    "since we use only unsaturated lines , assuming only one interstellar component should have no effect on the measurement of the total column densities .",
    "fits obtained with up to five interstellar components along the line of sight gave the same total column densities within the @xmath7 error  bars .    in order to test the various approaches of analyzing the interstellar lines from the  spectra",
    ", an artificial spectrum was created for the  team members ( moos et al .",
    "this simulated spectrum includes two interstellar clouds , lines in the stellar continuum , random noise , , high frequency ringing , dithered wavelengths , background , and a double gaussian lsf depending on the  segment .",

    "all the estimated column densities were in agreement with the inputs in the simulation within the  error bars .",

    "we can probably understand the difference between the o - based and n - based determinations of d / h in terms of the likelihood that n could be somewhat more ionized than h , whereas o and h are more strongly coupled to each other by charge exchange reactions .",

    "an approximate indication of the expected magnitudes of the deficiencies of and is shown in figure  2 of jenkins et al .  ( @xcite ) .    in any case , an accurate column density value is needed to obtain a reliable  measurement along this line of sight .",
    "eventual observation of the lyman  @xmath80 toward  should provide this value since this line is not on the flat part of the curve of growth and therefore the damping wings can be used to measure @xmath37 ( ) more accurately . as of now , d / o and d / n estimates appear to be more robust than d / h for the  sight line .    since , , and have nearly the same ionization potential , d / o ratio is an important proxy for the d / h ratio and its putative variations .",
    "d / o is very sensitive to astration , both from destruction and production ( timmes et al .",
    "if  measurements of the d / o ratio toward other stars shows a relatively uniform value with low dispersion , it would argue in favor of d / h and o / h homogeneity in the . indeed",
    ", the only other possibility would be that d / h and o / h vary precisely in the same way as to cause d / o to remain constant .",
    "it seems improbable since ( i ) o / h appears to be uniform in the  over paths of several hundred parsecs , and ( ii ) astration should lead to an anti - correlation of and abundances .",
    "an upcoming survey of and absorption along about 10 local lines of sight observed by  should help determine whether the d / o ratio varies significantly from one sight line to the others ( hbrard et al .",
    "initial indications are that the ratio does not vary substantially ( moos et al .",
    "we have presented  observations of the 905 - 1187    spectrum of the white dwarf .",
    "the column densities of several ions were measured through simultaneous fits to the numerous unsaturated absorption lines detected in the four channels and through the three apertures .",
