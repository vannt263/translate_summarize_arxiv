    "naphthalene was extensively purified by the zone melting method and then a single crystal of naphthalene doubly - doped with @xmath380.005  mol% pentacene and @xmath381  mol% 2-fluoronaphthalene was grown by the bridgman method .",
    "it was cut into a piece with a weight of @xmath382.5 mg and mounted in a cylindrical cavity ( te011 , 12.08 ghz ) so that the long axis of the pentacene molecules was parallel to the static magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "supplementary figure  1 is a detailed drawing of the experimental setup .",
    "dnp with photoexcited triplet electron spins was performed in the static field of 4000 g. we show the energy diagram of pentacene in supplementary figure  2 .",
    "598 nm laser irradiation was applied to the sample , so that the pentacene molecules underwent intersystem crossing from the excited singlet state to the excited triplet state .",
    "the population distribution over the triplet sublevels was highly biased in this orientation  @xcite . at the moment ,",
    "the high non - equilibrium electron spin polarization was transferred to the @xmath40h spins in pentacene molecules by ise  @xcite . in the ise , the microwave irradiation and the field sweep were applied in such a way that the inhomogeneously - broadened electron spin packets were adiabatically swept over , and the hartmann - hahn condition was satisfied between the electron spins in the rotating frame and the @xmath40h spins in the laboratory frame at a certain moment during the adiabatic passage .",
    "the electrons were returned to the ground state immediately after the ise .",
    "we accumulated the @xmath40h spin polarization by repeating the photoexcitation and the ise at sufficiently long intervals , during which the @xmath40h polarization localized in pentacene diffused to @xmath40h spins in the sample .",
    "it has been reported that the @xmath40h polarization in a single crystal of 0.018 mol% pentacene",
    "doped naphthalene has been enhanced to @xmath380.7 in 3000  g at 105 k  @xcite .    the sample shuttling from the center of the cavity in 4000  g to 13.5 centimeters above it in 100  g took @xmath380.67 seconds , and then , the sample stayed for 10 milliseconds and returned to an rf coil in 4000  g in @xmath380.67 seconds .",
    "in such a low field as 100 g , polarization transfer occurs even between heteronuclear spins .",
    "this spin dynamics mechanism has been studied for transferring _",
    "para_-hydrogen induced polarization ( phip ) into a molecule in solution  @xcite .",
    "after enhancing the @xmath40h polarization to @xmath380.12 by dnp and sample shuttling , the @xmath39f spin polarization measured by @xmath52 pulse excitation was @xmath380.11 , and therefore , the transfer efficiency of the polarization was @xmath3892% .",
    "the whole sample path was thermally insulated with a double - layered glass tube and cooled with nitrogen gas flow down to 233  k in order to suppress naphthalene sublimation and reduce t@xmath49 relaxation .",
    "@xmath43 of the @xmath40h spins in 4000  g was @xmath38212 minutes and that in 100  g , which was the lowest field on the sample path , was @xmath3834 minutes at 233 k. therefore , the total magnetization was scarcely decreased by the sample shuttling .",
    "the present sample system , which has very long @xmath43 and can be hyperpolarized , is a good test - bed for spin amplification experiments .",
    "we used the hermite 180@xmath53 pulse  @xcite with a peak amplitude of 140  khz shown in supplementary figure  3a as the quantum operation @xmath6 .",
    "as shown in supplementary figure  3b , its excitation range is broader than the inhomogeneous broadening of the @xmath39f spin in the sample , and the decrease in magnetization with the pulse at the offset of more than 300 khz is less than 0.1% .",
    "we also used the hermite 180@xmath53 pulse with a peak amplitude of 45  khz , of which the pulse length was @xmath383 times as long as that of 140  khz .",
    "the @xmath40h nmr signal was excited by a 5@xmath53 pulse and attenuated with -20  db and , therefore , reduced by a factor of more than a hundred on purpose to avoid saturation of the detection circuit .",
    "the @xmath40h and @xmath39f polarizations were determined by comparing them with the @xmath40h signal of ethanol and the @xmath39f signal of 2,3,4-trifluorobenz - aldehyde , respectively , in thermal equilibrium at 4000  g and 233  k. the polarization is defined by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the populations of up and down spins .",

    "<S> in addition , there is room for speeding up field cycling  @xcite , and hence earning the number of steps @xmath3 well before the @xmath40h polarization vanishes by t@xmath49 relaxation . </S>",

    "<S> the demonstrated spin amplification ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) ) can be straightforwardly modified to fig .  </S>",
