    "<S> 1 . introduction . </S>",
    "<S> *    the confrontation of non - perturbative issues associated with dynamical processes constitutes a problem of great importance which merits definite attention if qcd is to attain the status of a complete and fully self - consistent theory . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the most concrete advancement in formulating a non - perturbative casting of qcd is traced to wilson s proposal [ 1 ] which paved the way for the lattice formulation of gauge field theories in general . </S>",
    "<S> remarkable results have been produced , especially in relation to the study of static properties of hadrons [ 2 ] , finite temperature properties of the theory , etc .    </S>",
    "<S> on the analytical front , important theoretical progress , relevant to non - perturbative , dynamical explorations of qcd , has been achieved within the context of the loop equations [ 3 - 6 ] , while , in recent years , ( super)string theory has , through the ads / cft conjecture [ 7 - 9 ] , opened new pathways for approaching the non - perturbative domain of qcd , _ albeit _ in the sense of some supersymmetric version of the theory and within the context of unified schemes .    generally speaking , the nontrivial aspects of qcd as a relativistic gauge field theoretical system , stem from the fact that the non - abelian gauge symmetry entering its description incorporates an inherent non - linearity even before interaction terms with matter field agents are introduced . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical schemes aiming at a heads - on analytical confrontation of non - linear quantum field systems do , of course , exist , possibly the most concrete one being expressed in terms of the infinite battery of the schwinger - dyson equations . even in this case </S>",
    "<S> however , the relevant computational procedure for the solution of these ( integral ) equations is not only methodologically complex but , more importantly , unless totally summed , there is no _ a priori _ guarantee that they are in position to capture the full non - perturbative content of any given field theoretical system and/or describe its expected various phases .    a notable field theoretical approach aiming at the study of non - perturbative issues in qcd , such as confinement , chiral symmetry breaking _ etc , _ has been proposed by dosch and simonov [ 10 - 12 ] and goes by the name of stochastic vacuum model ( svm ) . by design </S>",
    "<S> , the construction of the model takes into consideration the non - trivial structure of the qcd vacuum state [ 13 ] , while , at the same time , it secures a role for the stokes theorem ( non - abelian casting thereof ) through which electric - magnetic duality issues can be fully taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the basic building blocks of the svm scheme are the , so called , _ field strength correlators _ , the definition of which will be given later , while for its computational strategy it employs the so - called field ( strength ) correlators method , fcm for short . </S>",
    "<S> for the reader not familiar with the svm , we hope that the information provided in this paper will sufficiently illustrate the reasoning behind its definition , as well as its properties and physical content . for a deeper insight to the model , one </S>",
    "<S> is referred to the original papers [ 10 - 12 ] and/or the excellent review articles [ 14,15 ] which also present a variety of its applications .    </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic aspect of the present work is that it adopts , as basic methodological tool , the worldline casting of gauge field theoretical systems [ 16 ] appropriately adjusted to the svm . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to confront genuinely non - perturbative issues associated with dynamical processes of physical interest . at the same time -and at a purely theoretical level- we hope that the present effort will offer new insights further promoting the effectiveness of the svm as a credible and viable theoretical tool for exploring the non - perturbative content of qcd .    the aim of the first part of this paper ( sections 2 and 3 ) is to accomplish the task of carrying out cumbersome computations which reveal fundamental properties of the svm that are of immediate relevance to our specific purposes and to establish the consistency of the model with the loop equations [ 3 - 6 ] , as well as the bianchi identity for qcd . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , such an occurrence strengthens the credibility of the svm as a theoretical construction which is consistent with qcd as a whole , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ in the sense that it goes beyond perturbation theory </S>",
    "<S> . our main theoretical application will be realized in the second part ( sections 4 and 5)where we undertake the description of a , theoretically simulated , meson - meson scattering process at the high energy , small momentum transfer kinematical ( regge ) regime . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant description of such a dynamical process necessarily  protrudes \" into the non - perturbative domain of qcd as represented , in our case , by the svm .    </S>",
    "<S> our presentation is organized as follows . in section ( 2 ) , we discuss general aspects which prepare the  fusing \" of the worldline description of a non - abelian gauge field theoretical system , such as qcd , with the svm . </S>",
    "<S> we start by focusing our attention on a situation where a matter field entity of spin @xmath0 interacts with a set of non - abelian gauge field modes as it propagates along a closed contour in ( euclidean ) space - time , hence subjected to a spin - field interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the basic dynamical content of the process will be displayed by two alternative formulations . </S>",
    "<S> the first focuses on the ( closed ) wilson contours traced by the particle entity . </S>",
    "<S> the second is based on a shifted field strength tensor that is integrated over an arbitrary surface bounded by the closed contour . </S>",
    "<S> obviously the ( non - abelian ) stokes theorem plays a central role in relating the two descriptions , an occurrence of central importance to our purposes , given that the stokes theorem enters the svm scheme in a major way .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall subsequently introduce the so - called cluster expansion [ 14 , 15 , 17 ] , which employs the field strength correlators , the basic dynamical quantities of the overall description . in fact , the cluster expansion is the essence of the stochastic nature of the model and provides the key element for quantifying the stochastic vacuum hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> once the aforementioned task is accomplished , we shall be in position to derive , as a first general result , the equation that determines the surface over which the two - point correlator must be integrated .    </S>",
    "<S> section 2 deals also with fairly demanding calculations within the context of the worldline formalism whose first result is the derivation of an explicit expression for the spin factor . </S>",
    "<S> the latter represents the genuinely non - perturbative , spin - field interaction dynamics and necessarily enters [ 18 ] the analysis of the meson - meson scattering process . </S>",
    "<S> section 3 is devoted to the verification of the loop equations and of the bianchi identity in the framework of the adopted approach . </S>",
    "<S> we consider these results to be of importance since they solidify the credibility of the svm as a construction which reproduces sound , theoretical properties of qcd and demonstrate the compatibility with its non - perturbative content .    in section 4 we present a semiclassical calculation of a simulated meson - meson scattering amplitude . the wilson loop that carries the dynamics of the process is a helicoidal embedded in a 4-dimensional background . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is performed in the framework of the svm and lead us to a regge - type behavior for the amplitude valid in the physical region of the scattering . </S>",
    "<S> corrections related to the fluctuations of the aforementioned wilson contour will be discussed in section 5 . in the same section </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the spin - factor is examined . </S>",
    "<S> some concluding comments will be made in the closing section .    </S>",
    "<S> * 2 . </S>",
    "<S> worldline formalism and field strength correlators . </S>",
    "<S> *    in this section , certain basic features of the field correlator method [ 15 ] will be reviewed in the context of the worldline casting of a quantum , gauge field theoretical system in interaction with a matter particle mode of a given spin @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> more explicitly , the particle entity is taken to propagate along a given , closed , contour ( worldline ) while interacting with a dynamical set of non - abelian gauge fields @xmath1 . according to our introductory discussion , the main objective is to introduce the necessary tools to facilitate non - perturbative , theoretical explorations of qcd in the framework of the svm .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important advantages of the worldline formalism is that it allows one to reduce the physical amplitudes to weighted integrals of averaged wilson loops [ 16 ] . in this connection </S>",
    "<S> , one can apply powerful techniques , such as the cluster expansion , both at the perturbative ( in the sense of series resummation ) and at the non - perturbative level . </S>",
    "<S> for the latter , the worldline formalism proves to be quite crucial because one can develop methods based on background gauge fixing strategy [ 18 - 22 ] , which enables one to treat the non - perturbative fields as background .    </S>",
    "<S> let us , then , consider a particle entity of spin @xmath0 propagating from some point and back to the same point while interacting dynamically with a non - abelian gauge field system @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the basic structure of the quantum mechanical amplitude associated with such a process is written in the worldline formalism ( all indices suppressed ; euclidean formalism adopted ) as follows [ 16 ] @xmath2 where it should be noted that the parameter @xmath3 has dimensions @xmath4 and must be integrated over through a weight factor @xmath5 in order to obtain a result with physical content . </S>",
    "<S> the matrices @xmath6 stand for the lorentz generators , pertaining to the spin of the propagating entity . accordingly </S>",
    "<S> , the last term represents the spin - field interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> the above expression for @xmath7 can be recast into the form [ 16 ] @xmath8 where @xmath9 defines a regularized expression for the area derivative [ 3 - 6 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> strictly speaking , expression ( 2 ) has a well defined meaning only for smooth [ 23 ] loops . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , when such expressions are used for the purpose of describing physically interesting processes the contour is forced to pass through points @xmath10 where momentum is imparted by an external agent ( field ) . such a situation </S>",
    "<S> is mathematically realized by inserting a corresponding chain of delta functions @xmath11 $ ] in the integral , which produces a loop with cusps , in which case the action of the area derivative operator entering ( 3 ) must be understood piecewise , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath12    the first step towards the application of the fcm is taken by employing the non - abelian stokes theorem [ 24 ] with the help of which one can write ( the symbol @xmath13 stands for surface ordering [ 14 ] ) @xmath14\\equiv{1\\over n_c } tr\\left\\langle p\\exp\\left(i\\oint_cdx\\cdot { \\cal a}\\right)\\right\\rangle_{\\cal a}={1\\over n_c}tr\\left\\langle p_s\\exp\\left[i\\int\\limits_{s(c)}ds_{\\mu\\nu}(z)g_{\\mu\\nu}(z , x_0)\\right]\\right\\rangle_{\\cal a},\\ ] ]    the above expression is valid for any loop @xmath15 with disc topology , irrespectively of the surface @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we also mention that for the area element we adopt the standard expression @xmath17 finally , in relation ( 5 ) we have set [ 14,15 ] @xmath18 with @xmath19 a phase factor [ 14,15 ] which is a parallel transporter known also , in the svm nomenclature [ 17 ] , as _ </S>",
    "<S> the reference point @xmath20 is chosen arbitrarily on the surface @xmath21 ; arbitrary is also the curve that joins the points @xmath20 and @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> it can be proved [ 24 ] that ( 5 ) depends neither on the surface nor on the contour used to define the connector ( 8) , as long as the non - abelian bianchi identities are satisfied . in the loop language such </S>",
    "<S> a requirement can be cast into the following statement :    the relation @xmath23\\right\\rangle_{\\cal a}=0\\ ] ] is valid independently of the surface choice provided that @xmath24=0,\\ ] ] which corresponds to the bianchi identity for the gauge system [ 6 ] .    the simplest way to prove </S>",
    "<S> the non - abelian stokes theorem is to adopt the contour gauge [ 15 ] @xmath25 with @xmath26\\}$ ] an arbitrary , smooth curve from the reference point @xmath20 to some point @xmath27 : @xmath28 indeed , using eq . ( </S>",
    "<S> 11 ) one can immediately see that @xmath29 for the gauge choice ( 11 ) the vector potential satisfies the condition @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , which implies that the connector ( 8) can be considered as the unit matrix in the contour gauge . in any case </S>",
    "<S> , the presence of the connectors in ( 7 ) guarantees gauge invariance .    </S>",
    "<S> the next step towards the application of the fcm is to introduce the so - called cluster expansion [ 10 - 12,14,15,17 ] for the wilson loop , formally written as @xmath14={1\\over n_c}tr\\exp\\left(\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{i^n}{n!}\\int\\limits_{s(c ) }     ds_{\\mu_n\\nu_n } \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot ds_{\\mu_1\\nu_1}<<g_{\\mu_n\\nu_n}(z_n , x_0)\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot g_{\\mu_1\\nu_1}(z_1,x_0)>>\\right),\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath32 translates as follows : @xmath33 and is reminiscent of the cluster expansion in statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> it is pointed out that , due to the color neutrality of the vacuum , expectation values of all correlators in ( 14 ) are proportional to the unit matrix in color space . </S>",
    "<S> this makes color ordering unnecessary .    </S>",
    "<S> the formula of eq.(14 ) quantifies the formulation of the svm . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out [ 14,15]that the most important contribution to the cluster expansion comes from the two - point correlator : @xmath34 the above defines the _ field strength correlator _ , a quantity which constitutes the basic building block of the model .    </S>",
    "<S> some natural assumptions are incorporated in the above definition . </S>",
    "<S> the first has to do with the lorentz invariance of the vacuum , which is explicitly indicated in the left hand side of ( 16 ) by the fact that the correlator depends on the _ distance _ between the points @xmath22 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the second is that , on the other hand , the correlator does not depend on ( the gauge parameter ) @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a credible assumption , taking into account the fact that we have been working , from the very beginning , with a gauge invariant amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the basic assumption of the svm leads to the statement that @xmath14\\propto\\exp\\left[-{1\\over2}\\int\\limits_{s(c)}ds_{\\mu\\nu}(z)\\int\\limits_{s(c)}ds_{\\lambda\\rho}(z ' ) \\delta^{(2)}_{\\mu\\nu,\\lambda\\rho}(z - z')\\right],\\ ] ] where the surface element enters through the use of the ( non - abelian ) stokes theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> two important points should now be made . </S>",
    "<S> first , the last expression is supposed to be valid in a certain limit . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , it is assumed [ 10 - 12,14,15 ] that the vacuum fluctuations establish a _ correlation length _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 beyond which correlations decay very fast . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath37 is an order of magnitude estimation for the two point correlator , relation ( 17 ) is considered as an asymptotic approximation which is valid in the limit @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the second is that , while expression ( 14 ) does not depend on the particular surface one uses for the application of the non - abelian stokes theorem , approximation ( 17 ) does . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the stochasticity assumption transforms relation ( 9 ) to an equation which determines the dominant surface in the cluster expansion . to quantify this statement we write @xmath39={1\\over2}\\int\\limits_{s(c)}ds_{\\mu\\nu}(z)\\int\\limits_{s(c)}ds_{\\lambda\\rho}(z ' ) \\delta^{(2)}_{\\mu\\nu,\\lambda\\rho}(z - z'),\\ ] ] from which it is easily determined that @xmath40,\\ ] ] where we have written @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the derivative of the correlator ( 16 ) needs to take into account [ 15 ] the presence of the connectors @xmath42 . in appendix </S>",
    "<S> a we show that @xmath43 with @xmath44 given the above , we conclude that @xmath45\\ ] ] and consequently write @xmath46,\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above analysis establishes the following relation [ 15 ] among the derivatives of the correlator : @xmath48 where @xmath49 thus , if one assumes the validity of the bianchi identities @xmath50 , one concludes that @xmath51 accordingly , eq ( 9 ) can be represented as follows @xmath52 it is worth noting that @xmath53 is a three point correlation function and it would be _ identically zero _ if we were considering an abelian gauge theory so that the above relation becomes , really , an identity , telling nothing about the particular surface involved in stokes theorem , an expected result given that relation ( 17 ) is exact in the framework of qed . </S>",
    "<S> an extensive discussion of the physical content of the correlator @xmath53 can be found in [ 14,15 ] . according to </S>",
    "<S> the analysis presented in the aforementioned references confinement in qcd occurs due to the non - zero value of the ( non - abelian ) correlator @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.(27 ) indicates that this correlator also defines the relevant surface on which the two - point correlator  lives \" .    </S>",
    "<S> now , it has been demonstrated [ 10 - 12,14,15 ] that , in the asymptotic limit @xmath54 , eq.(27 ) determines the surface @xmath21 bounded by the contour @xmath15 as the minimal one . to demonstrate this we employ the following general lorentz structure representation [ 14,15 ] for the two - point correlation function : @xmath55-(\\mu\\leftrightarrow\\nu)\\right\\},\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that @xmath57 with the help of the above relation eq.(27 ) can be cast into the form @xmath58    the functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 have been measured in lattice calculations [ 25 ] and have been found to be of very fast decrease as @xmath61 . in the considered region both of them were found to be of the form @xmath62 and that they go exponentially fast to zero for @xmath63 . in this region , we write : @xmath64    in the considered limit and taking into account that @xmath65 we find @xmath66=0,\\ ] ] where the string tension @xmath67 has been introduced and where we have also written @xmath68 for the area of the surface bounded by the wilson curve . in the last equations we used the dimensionless parameter @xmath69 and we have written @xmath70 the induced metric . </S>",
    "<S> it accordingly follows that in the limit @xmath71 , the surface on which the two - point correlation dominates is the minimal one .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn our attention on the _ spin factor _ , whose role is to incorporate the spin - field interaction in the framework of the worldline formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we mention that in the present work we shall be dealing with massive fermions . it should be noted , at the same time , that the spin factor can also be extended [ 21,22 ] for the case of , massless , bosons of spin-1 . accordingly , the calculations to be presented in this section can easily be extended to bosonic fields .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by inserting into the svm formula for the wilson loop , _ cf . </S>",
    "<S> _ eq.(17 ) , into the worldline integral expression ( 1 ) , the basic goal being that of calculating the spin - field interaction with the help of the area derivative operator defined in ( 3 ) . </S>",
