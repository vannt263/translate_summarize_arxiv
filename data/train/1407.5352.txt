    "<S> when the electron spin polarization ( of the donors and free electrons ) is high , it is necessary to flip either the donor or the free electron to form the bound singlet . </S>",
    "<S> sekiguchi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al .  _ have suggested that when spin - orbit interactions are weak , as in silicon , this trapping process is most likely mediated by the hyperfine interaction , resulting in the hyperpolarization of the nuclear spins @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> altenatively , the hyperpolarization could be produced by cross - relaxation of the donors , as they are heated up by the optically - excited conduction band electrons @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the long time component of the growth curve observed at 1.7  k was not measured beyond 2.5  h polarization time at 4.2  k ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : build_up ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar bi - exponential growth has been observed in a recent microwave - induced dnp experiment on phosphorus donors in natural abundance silicon ( doping concentration of @xmath32 @xmath1 ) at 4.6  t and temperatures of 200  mk and 1  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they observed a short timescale of 15  s and a longer timescale of 1100  s in their experiment . </S>",
    "<S> though they attribute the presence of the longer timescale to the presence of @xmath9si spins around the phosphorus donors , this is unlikely to be the case here , as a similar bi - exponential behavior is observed in our isotopically - enriched silicon-28 crystal .    </S>",
    "<S> we were unable to measure the signal from the phosphorus nuclei in the absence of hyperpolarization , making it difficult to directly quantify either the sign or the magnitude of the nuclear spin polarization . in order to estimate the phosphorus nuclear spin polarization , we moved the sample to an x - band cw esr spectrometer following optical excitation at 4.2  k for three hours at 6.71  t. the resulting esr spectrum , measured at 4.2  k , is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , supplementary material . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the measured phosphorus polarization , calculated from the difference in the integrated intensities of the two esr lines , is -11  % , which is the lower bound for the induced hyperpolarization at 4.2  k , as some of the polarization will have decayed as the sample was removed from the 6.71  t field and warmed up , before being cooled back down in the esr cryostat . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a lower bound of @xmath4  % ( @xmath33 ) for the polarization at 1.7  k. the negative sign of the hyperpolarization , indicated by the higher intensity of the high - field line compared to the low - field line , is in agreement with prior high - field edmr results @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we performed spin - echo experiments to measure the coherence time of the @xmath5p nuclear spins . following 200  s of laser irradiation , a hahn - echo sequence ( @xmath34acquire ) </S>",
    "<S> was used to measure the nuclear spin coherence time ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : t2 ] ) . by recording the echo signal while varying the delay time ( @xmath31 ) , we measured the signal decay at both 4.2  k and 1.7  k as shown in figure [ fig : t2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the data with a single exponential decay , and measured nuclear spin t@xmath6 values of 56  ms and 421  ms at 4.2  k and 1.7  k respectively .    as the magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> is increased , it is observed that the electron spin t@xmath7 at low temperature , and high field gets significantly shorter since t@xmath35 as the result of a direct single - phonon relaxation process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hyperfine interaction is field independent so the main factor limiting the nuclear t@xmath36 is the electron t@xmath7 carrying the @xmath5p - spin to the electron spin @xmath37 manifold @xcite ( see supplementary materials for details ) . in the presence of light , </S>",
    "<S> the t@xmath7 is further shortened by up to two orders of magnitude due to trapping and re - emission , with t@xmath7 on the order of 2  ms in the presence of light and almost 20  ms in the dark at 8.56  t @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> the electron spin undergoing t@xmath7 relaxation induces an effective t@xmath36 process on the nuclear spin with time constant t@xmath38(see supplementary information ) . if @xmath39 1 then @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the probability for the electron to be in the excited state . the high temperature limit of this model has been applied to explain the nuclear t@xmath36 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that the experimentally observed nuclear @xmath42 combines two independent effects @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is temperature independent , then we obtain @xmath45 . this in turn puts an upper bound on the electron relaxation time @xmath46 or @xmath47 , where we have assumed that @xmath41 is given by the equilibrium thermal probability . </S>",
    "<S> this value is shorter than the t@xmath48  ms measured in the dark at 8.56  t @xcite .    in order to minimize the effect of environmental fluctuations we applied a cpmg refocusing pulse sequence to extend the nuclear spin coherence time . in the cpmg sequence </S>",
    "<S> the single @xmath49 pulse of the hahn echo is substituted with a series of @xmath49 pulses that are 90out of phase with respect to each other , with a @xmath31 spacing of 2  ms . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting echo decay is presented in figure [ fig : t2 ] , with a single exponential fit to the data returning t@xmath6 = 1.2  s 0.1  s , a factor of almost 3 improvement in nuclear spin coherence time . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the value of 1.75  s measured previously using endor at 5.5  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this cpmg sequence will refocus interactions between the phosphorus nucleus and other spins ( or fields ) that are fluctuating on a time scale longer than a few hundred hertz . </S>",
    "<S> the sequence will thus refocus fluctuations due to distant donor electrons , silicon nuclei ( the silicon - phosphorus nuclear dipolar coupling is very small and does not play an important role here @xcite ) and static field inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> the phosphorus nuclear dipolar coupling is not refocused , but is only about 1.5  mhz for our donor concentration , and the dominant contribution from the electron t@xmath50 induced nuclear t@xmath36 is also not refocused by the cpmg sequence .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we confirmed the long t@xmath51 relaxation times , at 4.2  k and 1.7  k temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : t1 ] shows t@xmath51 data for two experiments , a 200  s laser polarization pulse , followed by : in the first case a delay time @xmath31 and a @xmath15-read - out pulse ; in the second case @xmath49-@xmath31-@xmath15 pulse sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the only difference between the two runs is the initial nuclear state . if most of the population is localized in @xmath24 state , applying a @xmath49-pulse before the read - out pulse will move it to the @xmath25 state ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : energy_diagram]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the t@xmath51 relaxation should not depend on the initial state , which is confirmed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : t1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we observe that the spin - lattice relaxation time not only increases at lower temperatures but also exceeds the measuring times of our setup , no visible decay was observed after waiting for delay time @xmath524.5  h ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : t1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> , measured with the hahn echo at 4.2  k temperature , open squares , hahn echo at 1.7  k , full circles , and cpmg pulse sequence at 1.7  k , open diamonds . </S>",
    "<S> all data were measured in 6.7  t field , with 200  s of optical polarization provided by a 1047  nm , 100  mw , above - gap laser . ]    , measured with a simple @xmath15 read - out pulse at 4.2  k ( open triangles ) and 1.7  k ( black squares ) , respectively , and with an inversion recovery pulse sequence ( closed circles ) at 4.2  k. ]    in conclusion , the results presented here show the first single fid measurement of the local magnetic fields seen by @xmath5p nuclear spins in a dilute crystal of @xmath14si . </S>",
    "<S> the negative @xmath5p polarization is @xmath5311  % at 4.2  k , and @xmath5464 % at 1.7  k and 6.71  t. it was accomplished by directly illuminating the sample with an above gap 1047  nm laser for over 5  h at 1.7  k and 2.7  h at 4.2  k. we were able to extend the t@xmath6 relaxation time to 1.2  s at 1.7  k , and confirm an extremely long t@xmath7 of the @xmath5p nuclear spins at 1.7  k which could not be determined within the timescale of this experiment . </S>",
