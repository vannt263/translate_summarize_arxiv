    "the overdoped regime of cuprate superconductors has not been intensively investigated , compared to the well studied pseudogap phase in the underdoped regime @xcite , although many unresolved problems remain in the former .",
    "one of the reasons for this situation is that it is believed that in the overdoped regime , the system is approaching a conventional fermi liquid state and thus nothing peculiar happens .",
    "the other is a technical reason that only limited materials such as tl - based cuprates can achieve the overdoped state .    among some anomalies in the overdoped regime ,",
    "we focus here on the low energy optical response .",

    "d_-wave symmetry , the optical conductivity is suppressed below the gap energy ( @xmath7 ) and gradually decreases towards zero at @xmath8 . however , in many cuprates , a substantial amount of conductivity remains finite at @xmath9 , forming a drude - like spectrum even at @xmath10 .",
    "this residual conductivity suggests the presence of unpaired normal carriers in the superconducting state .",
    "impurity pair - breaking could be one of the sources for this residual conductivity , since zn - doped cuprates exhibit a similar low frequency response @xcite .",
    "the problem is that this anomaly can be observed even in impurity - free samples @xcite .",

    "it seems to be related to overdoping , but not conclusive because disorder - induced pair - breaking can not be ignored in most cases .",
    "for example , ca - substitution for y in yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 lowers the maximum _ _ t__@xmath12 value presumably because it introduces disorders into the cuo@xmath2-planes , while it also introduces carrier - holes into the system .",
