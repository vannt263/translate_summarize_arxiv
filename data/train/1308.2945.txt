    "we can then interpolate @xmath188 to @xmath259 at zero @xmath13 .",
    "there is no non - trivial structure at intermediate @xmath13 . for @xmath187 ,",
    "the @xmath205 curve seems to be at odd with other @xmath0 curves , but this anomaly disappears when viewed in the @xmath203 plot .    the fact that @xmath260 while @xmath261 at finite @xmath13 is intriguing .",
    "it means a gradient @xmath25 can drive a current @xmath231 along the @xmath262 direction , but it will also drive currents of different flavors in the opposite direction .",
    "this backward current phenomenon seems counter intuitive at the first sight .",
    "but the physics behind is just that the flavor singlet current experiences more collisions in a flavor singlet medium than the flavor non - singlet ones . if the medium is flavor non - singlet , e.g. @xmath263 while the other chemical potentials all vanish , then the flavor non - singlet current @xmath264 will experience more collisions than the flavor singlet current .",
    "therefore , we will have @xmath265 .",
    "this is consistent with eq.([lab ] ) derived from the symmetry of the ll order along .",
    "thus the simple explanation based on collisions that we presented above seems quite generic .",
    "it might happen in other systems such as cold atoms as well . in that case ,",
    "cold atom experiments might be the most promising ones to observe this backward current phenomenon .",
    "we have calculated the conductivity matrix of a weakly coupled quark - gluon plasma at the leading - log order . by setting all quark chemical potentials to be identical ,",
    "the diagonal conductivities become degenerate and positive , while the off - diagonal ones become degenerate but negative ( or zero when the chemical potential vanishes ) .",
    "this means a potential gradient of a certain fermion flavor can drive backward currents of other flavors .",
    "a simple explanation is provided for this seemingly counter intuitive phenomenon .",
    "it is speculated that this phenomenon is generic and most easily measured in cold atom experiments .",
