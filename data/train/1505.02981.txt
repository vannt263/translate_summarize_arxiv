    "although we have long known that early - type galaxies ( etgs ) can harbour a stellar disc , their actual distribution of bulge - to - disc ratios b / d has been debated for many decades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , a number of studies based on broad - band imaging and integral - field spectroscopy at optical wavelengths have concluded that most etgs host a stellar disc , and that etgs as a family cover a similar range of b / d ratio as spirals @xcite .",
    "discs are detected also with a number of additional techniques such as narrow - band imaging of emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath4 ) , imaging of dust absorption , or the observation of the kinematics of planetary nebulae and globular clusters @xcite .",
    "taken together , these results suggest that galaxy evolution is dominated by processes which allow the growth and survival of stellar discs in galaxies of both early- and late type .",
    "discs have also been found in the cold gas phase of etgs by means of both neutral hydrogen ( hi ) and co observations .",
    "more recently , atlas@xmath5  observations of hi  and co have shown that @xmath050 percent of all etgs contain some cold gas ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s12 ) .",
    "molecular gas is typically found in small gas discs in the central regions and is linked to small amounts of star formation @xcite . in contrast , in @xmath020 percent of etgs outside clusters hi  has been found distributed in low - column density discs or rings with typical sizes of many tens of kpc , much larger than the stellar body ( s12 ) .",
    "if the column density of the gas is high enough , these hi  discs are potential fuel for star formation ( sf ) .",
    "contrary to the general idea that galaxies evolve from late- to early type , these hi  reservoirs could generate the growth of stellar discs and therefore trigger the transition of the host from an early- to a late - type morphology @xcite .        in this context",
    ", many recent studies have focused on the presence of sf in the outer discs of etgs @xcite .",
    "such sf is typically traced by uv light emitted by massive stars of age up to several hundreds myr .",
    "@xcite show that @xmath040 percent of 38 red sequence and blue cloud etgs with stellar mass below @xmath6 m@xmath7 have extended uv discs , which is evidence for disc growth in these objects .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to bring these two lines of investigation ( hi  and uv ) together and study sf in the large hi  disc of the early - type galaxy ngc  4203 .",
    "this is a nearby , nearly face - on lenticular .",
    "figure [ fig : images ] shows an sdss @xmath8-band image of the galaxy ( left panel ) and table [ table : parameters ] provides some basic information .",
    "ngc  4203 has been observed at many wavelengths .",
    "optical studies show that ngc  4203 has a relatively massive stellar disc ( @xmath9 - 0.5  * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "early hi  observations revealed a low - column - density hi  disc with a complex morphology .",
    "more recent observations show that the hi  disc extends to very large radius and is characterised by spiral - like hi  arms ( s12 ) .",
    "this gas rotates regularly around the galaxy and is kinematically aligned with the stellar disc @xcite .",
    ".general properties of ngc  4203 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + [ table : parameters2 ]      figure [ fig : images2 ] shows that ngc  4203 hosts some diffuse fuv emission at the location of the inner hi  ring .",
    "additionally , at the same location , we see spiral - like structure in both the 8  @xmath3 m and @xmath2 images , which is clumpy and almost identical in these images .",
    "moreover , the extended spiral / ring structures in the model subtracted deep optical image ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : images3 ] ) correspond to the dust lanes visible in the megacam @xmath2 colour image .",
    "in contrast , the bright hi  arm @xmath0 2 arcmin west of the galaxy ( visible in the same figure and referred to as western hi  arm in the rest of this paper ) does not exhibit any clear fuv emission .",
    "a similar picture is evident from the 8  @xmath3m - non stellar image and the @xmath2 image .",
    "while there is clear emission from pahs and dust absorption in the hi  ring , these features are absent from the region occupied by the western hi  arm .",
    "the question is why these two regions have such different levels of the fuv and 8  @xmath3 m emission despite the very similar hi  column density .",
    "we will come back to this point in sec [ sec : discussion_1 ] .    as indicated in sec .",
    "[ sec:8mu ] , the deep optical images show a dwarf satellite @xmath0 7.2 arcmin ( 32  kpc ) east of the ngc  4203 .",
    "this dwarf is red and at a similar redshift with @xmath10 kms@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass of the dwarf is roughly @xmath12 m@xmath7 from the sdss-@xmath13 band photometry .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : images3 ] reveals prominent tidal tails associated to the dwarf and a faint stream , which has the same direction as these tidal tails . from this point , it is clear that the satellite dwarf galaxy is interacting with ngc  4203 , for example , these features may be associated with a single on - going minor merger event .",
    "we will discuss this point in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion_2 ] .",
    "we derive the radial profile of hi , uv and infrared emission along circular annuli whose width increases logarithmically from inside out .",
    "the inner region of the radial profiles ( 1 @xmath14 ) is contaminated by old stars in the bulge and , therefore , we do not include it in our sfr calculation .",
    "figure [ fig : rp_log ] shows the resulting hi  and uv radial profiles together .",
    "the first peak of the hi  profile indicates the location of the inner hi  ring @xmath0 30 - 80 arcsec from the centre .",
    "we find that the slope of the declining fuv profile becomes flatter in this region consistent with the presence of diffuse fuv emission associated with the star formation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : images2 ] ) . additionally , the fuv - nuv colour becomes significantly bluer at the same location .",
    "this might be because the young stellar populations are dominant in this region .",
    "the second peak in the hi  profile of fig .",
    "[ fig : rp_log ] ( @xmath0 120 - 150 arcsec ) is caused by the high column density gas in the western hi  arm ( see fig . [",
    "fig : images2 ] ) . unlike for",
    "the first peak of the hi  profile , here the fuv profile does not seem to depart from the general declining trend .",
    "however , the fuv - nuv colour seems to become bluer at this location .",
    "the most significant diffuse fuv emission in ngc  4203 comes from a region close to the uv - bright galaxy bulge .",
    "the emission from the bulge may contaminate a large region around it because the galex psf is characterized by broad wings out to at least 60 arcsec . to quantify this effect",
    "we create a bulge model with a srsic surface brightness profile and convolve it with the fuv psf .",
    "we find that the average contamination from the bulge is @xmath15 abmag  arcsec@xmath16 between 50 and 60 arcsec .",
    "this contribution to the total emission is very low and we ignore this effect in our sfr calculation .        in order to take into account the significant 8  @xmath3 m non - stellar emission in the inner hi  ring ( see fig . [",
    "fig : images2 ] ) , we derive the sfr radial profiles based on this 8  @xmath3 m emission as well as the 24  @xmath3 m emission ( see sec . [ sec:8mu ] and eqs .",
    "[ eq : eq4 ] and [ eq : eq5 ] ) .",
    "we show the resulting sfr radial profiles together with the fuv one in fig .",
    "[ fig : spitandfuv ] .",
    "all profiles show a similar trend as their slope changes at the location of the hi  ring ( in fact , at 8 @xmath3 m the profile increases significantly between 30 and 60 arcsec ) .",
    "the infrared based sfr profiles are up to a factor @xmath0  3 higher than the profile based on the fuv emission alone .",
    "this difference is larger than the errors in the photometric measurements and is likely due to infrared emission from obscured star formation .",
    "the photometric uncertainty for the _ spitzer _ 8 and 24  @xmath3 m images is @xmath0 a factor of 2 , and this uncertainty is also similar for the fuv measurements @xcite .",
    "however , at present , the depth of the spitzer images and the small fov imply that the uv images are the only reliable tracer of sf at larger radius .",
    "table [ table : parameters2 ] shows the sfr efficiencies at the location of the inner hi  ring for all 3 tracers as well as their approximate uncertainties .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : intermsofradius ] we compare hi  and sfr surface density by plotting the hi  and fuv radial profiles of fig .",
    "[ fig : spitandfuv ] against one another . in this figure points",
    "are colour - coded according to the distance from the galaxy centre .",
    "the reason that the track described by our measurements is not monotonic is the result of the two hi  peaks ( one corresponding to the inner hi  ring and the other to the outer hi  arm ; see figs . [",
    "fig : images2 ] and [ fig : rp_log ] ) while the uv radial profile decreases monotonically with radius . for comparison ,",
    "the yellow area shows the spatially resolved relation between hi  and sfr surface density inside @xmath17 for a sample of nearby ( d  @xmath18  12  mpc ) spirals covering a range of morphologies @xcite . in this inner region ,",
    "interstellar medium of these galaxies is dominated by molecular hydrogen .",
    "the green vertically and horizontally shaded areas show the same relation for the outer parts ( i.e. , 1 - 2 @xmath19 ) of dwarf and spiral galaxies , respectively @xcite .",
    "details about their sample , e.g. , the things sample , are given in @xcite .",
    "this figure shows that the sf efficiency in the bright hi  ring around ngc  4203 is consistent with that of late - type galaxies .",
    "moreover , the sf efficiency in the outer regions of ngc  4203 is also consistent with that of outer regions of spiral and dwarf galaxies .",
    "so far we have compared hi  and sfr surface density at fixed radius .",
    "below , we perform a pixel by pixel comparison as implemented by previous authors .",
    "to do so , we smooth and re - grid the fuv and infrared images to the resolution and coordinate grid of the hi  image .",
    "we find this comparison to be characterised by a very large scatter .",
    "for this reason , we bin the points along the hi column density axis , and show the average sfr surface density of each bin as well as the scatter in fig .",
    "[ fig : intermsofhi ] .",
    "this plot shows a weak trend between hi  and sfr surface density as well as a large scatter , represented by the blue bars .",
    "this large variation of sf efficiency at fixed hi  column density is also clear when one compares the hi  ring and the western hi  arm mentioned above .",
    "the green asterisks and red pentagon indicate the average values of sfr surface denstiy and hi  column density in these two regions , respectively , and are calculated on the basis of the fuv image . combining the 24 @xmath3",
    "m image with the fuv image , the sfr estimate increases further , as illustrated by the first green line .",
    "if we calculate the sfr with the 8  @xmath3 m non - steallar emission , we obtain the value that is indicated by the second green bar . as argued above , this strengthens our claim that sf efficiency in the inner hi  ring is as high as that of spiral galaxies , while it is much lower in the western hi  arm despite the similar gas density .",
    "however , we note that even if the sfr is low in the western hi  arm , this sfr is still consistent with the outer regions of spirals and dwarf galaxies .",
    "the previous section demonstrates that at any given hi  column density there is a large range of sfr surface densities and , therefore , sf efficiencies in the hi  disc of ngc  4203 .",
    "this is highlighted by the comparison between the hi  ring and the western hi  arm presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : intermsofhi ] .",
    "there are a number of possible explanations for the difference between these two regions : ( i ) there may be no direct relation between hi  and sf ; ( ii ) the hi  column density of the arm might appear to be higher because of projection effects ( e.g. , the hi  arm stretches away from the plane of the disc ) , and the actual density of the gas could be too low to form stars ; ( iii ) the temperature of the hi  in the arm may be higher than in the ring , making it more difficult to form stars ; ( iv ) the metallicity and dust content of the inner and outer regions might be different due to a difference in formation processes ; ( v ) the western hi  arm may be stable against gravitational instabilities , preventing the formation of stars .",
    "both the second and third points would result in a broadening of the hi  spectral profile at the location of the hi  arm .",
    "this is , however , not observed , leaving us with no clear indication in favour of these options . on the other hand , the fourth point seems an attractive explanation . @xcite",
    "observe a quasar @xmath0 2 arcmin south - east of the galaxy .",
    "interestingly , they detect one of the closest known damped ly@xmath20 ( dla ) system .",
    "this dla system belongs to ngc  4203 , and the metallicity of the gas to be [ fe / h ]  =  -2.29",
    "@xmath21  0.1 . they also show a number of heavy - element abundances such as [ mn / h]@xmath18 -0.68 and [ mg / h ] @xmath22 - 2.4 , respectively .",
    "the velocity of the lines are identical to that of the hi  emission from the disc of ngc  4203 at the position of the quasar within ( @xmath2110 kms@xmath11 ) .",
    "although the metal abundance values are very low , the depletion of the heavy elements onto small dust grains can affect the observed measurements .",
    ", for instance , show that the corrected [ fe / h ] abundance of a dla system can be on average 0.5 dex ( in some extreme cases 1 dex ) higher than that of observed .",
    "even if we consider 1 dex depletion effect , the metallicity of the outer hi  disc remains very low ( i.e. , [ fe / h ] @xmath0 -1.29 ) .",
    "this is likely quite different from the inner hi  ring , which is known to contain a considerable amount of dust ( fig .",
    "[ fig : images2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we know that the pah molecules traced by the 8  @xmath3 m emission are vunerable to highly energetic photons in dust poor environments due to low dust shielding , and the pah emission generally vanishes in regions with metallicity below solar @xcite .",
    "thus the metallicity in the inner region should be significantly higher than in the outer regions .",
    "consequently , different formation processes for the inner and outer hi  regions can explain these different metallicities .",
    "the last possibility is the differences of the gravitational instabilities of the hi  gas in the inner and outer regions .",
    "for example , star formation can occur in regions where the gas disc is unstable against large - scale collapse .",
    "if the gas is stable against it , coriolis forces counteract the self - gravity of the gas and suppress star formation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this might explain the different sf efficiencies .",
    "however , in order to understand this effect , we need further investigation .",
    "there are different scenarios that could explain the origin of the hi  disc of ngc  4203 .",
    "one possibility is a high - angular - momentum , gas - rich major merger .",
    "such a merger could result in the formation of a large gas disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at the same time , it would not necessarily trigger the central burst of sf usually thought to occur during mergers , as evidenced by the old stellar populations in the centre of ngc  4203 .",
    "if this scenario is correct , we should able to see a residual from the major merger close to the centre , or a distortion in the outer stellar halo of ngc  4203 in the deep optical image .",
    "however , we do not detect any of these features in fig .",
    "[ fig : images3 ] .",
    "another problem with the major merger scenario is the extremely low metallicity of the outer disc which may rule out that the hi  once belonged to a large galaxy .",
    "the other possibility is that the gas has been accreted from the inter - galactic medium .",
    "the disturbed appearance of the hi  disc may be explained by some minor interaction with a satellite .",
    "indeed , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : propertieshi ] , there is a nearby dwarf satellite , which is most likely interacting with our galaxy .",
    "although this dwarf is positioned at the end of one of the hi  arms of ngc 4203 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) , we do not detect any hi  emission at that position and , therefore , rule out that it is the donor of the hi  gas .",
    "however , there is another possibility that this gas can be captured from another gas - rich dwarf galaxy in a single encounter .",
    "since the hi  disc is almost regular , this event would happen at least a couple gyr ago , making it difficult to detect .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion of based on a study of the environment around the galaxy .    in conclusion ,",
    "accretion from the inter - galactic medium would explain the low metallicity of the outer disc , while the inner hi  ring may have been enriched of metals by stellar mass loss in the galaxy .",
    "moreover , the disturbed appearance of the outer disc can be explained by an interaction with the satellite visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] and [ fig : images3 ] .",
    "we have long known that a large fraction of all etgs host low levels of on - going or recent sf .",
    "this sf activity is detected in their centre using optical spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or uv photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "similar to extended - uv discs in late - type galaxies , star formation can also be detected at large radius in early - type galaxies using uv and deep optical imaging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a few cases it has been possible to establish a link between the presence of hi  and sf at the outskirts of etgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we explore such link for ngc  4203 , and in this section we quantify the impact that the sf hosted within the hi  disc has on the morphology of the host .",
    "table [ table : parameters2 ] shows the result of our sfr calculation based on the various tracers discussed above , and performed separately for the inner hi  ring and the remaining , outer hi  disc . in particular , the inner hi  ring hosts a significant amount of dust - obscured sf , and the sfr is best estimated using a combination of 24  @xmath3 m and fuv emission .",
    "the inner hi  ring and outer hi  disc are very different from each other .",
    "the former contains only @xmath010 percent of the total hi  mass but hosts @xmath097 percent of the total sf .",
    "the latter hosts the remaining @xmath090 percent of the hi  mass but only @xmath03 percent of the total sf . as a result",
    "the hi  depletion time is much longer in the outer disc ( @xmath23 gyr ) than in the inner hi  ring ( @xmath05 gyr ) .",
    "if nothing happens to the galaxy , the hi  disc could survive for hundreds of a hubble time at the current sfr .",
    "overall , the detected amount of sf has a negligible effect on the stellar disc growth and , therefore , the morphology of ngc  4203 .",
    "based on the total stellar mass reported by @xcite and on the b / d ratio given in @xcite , the mass of the stellar disc is @xmath02.7 @xmath24 m@xmath7 . at the current sfr , this mass would grow by a mere 0.1 percent in 1 gyr .",
    "the star formation rate per unit stellar mass in the stellar disc is of just @xmath0 @xmath25 yr@xmath11 .",
    "if we suddenly convert all the gas in the outer hi  disc of ngc  4203 to stars , the r band surface brightness of this region would be 26.8 mag arcsec@xmath16 .",
    "this is @xmath0 2 magnitude lower than malin 1 , a giant low surface brightness galaxy that has a low surface brightness and very large hi  disc . in conclusion",
    "it is unlikely that ngc  4203 will become a galaxy similar to malin 1 .",
    "ngc  4203 has an hi  disc that consists of two separate components .",
    "the first component is the inner star forming hi  ring .",
    "this ring contains metal - rich gas and a large amount of dust .",
    "the sf efficiency in the hi  ring is comparable to that of inner regions of spiral galaxies and the hi  depletion time is of the order of a few gyr .",
    "the second component is the outer hi  disc , where the metallicity is likely to be low .",
    "the sf efficiency in this disc is much lower than that of centre of spirals even when the hi  column density is high ( e.g. , in the western hi  arm ) and the hi  depletion time is of 100 s of the hubble time .",
    "however , the sf effieciency in the outer hi  disc is still consistent with that of the outer regions of spiral galaxies and dwarfs .    these two components of the hi  structure may be formed in different ways . on the one hand ,",
    "the hi  ring is most likely enriched by stellar processes within the galaxy . on the other hand",
    ", the outer hi  disc might be accreted from the low metallicity igm because the outer disc is formed with metal - poor , high column density gas and we can not find a suitable donor .",
    "subsequent interaction with satellites , which is possibly on - going , may explain the current distorted morphology of the hi  disc .",
    "we also detect spiral - like structure in the 8  @xmath3 m and deep @xmath2 images .",
    "these spiral - like structure is extending to 3 effective radii ( @xmath0 6kpc ) , and , because of its clumpiness , is likely organized by the star formation process .",
    "finally , despite the large hi  reservoir and the detection of some sf , the stellar disc of ngc  4203 is growing at a very low rate and the morphology of the galaxy is unlikely to change significantly in the foreseeable future .",
