    "<S> functionalization is a major challenge for future applications . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , the molecular orbitals of swnts play a major role since they are fully involved in the transport properties and the chemical reactivity of swnts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular their spatial electronic distribution is a key factor in chemical reactions @xcite and in adsorption process @xcite . in transport experiments </S>",
    "<S> , it is an important parameter for the contact quality between a tube and an electrode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a complete understanding and control of the molecular orbitals of nanotubes is therefore crucial for the development of future nanotubes based applications .    </S>",
    "<S> scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) are unique tools to measure local electronic properties of swnts and correlate them with their atomic structure . </S>",
    "<S> sts studies have confirmed the predictions of the simple zone folding tight - binding model which relates the metallic or semiconductor character to the chirality of swnts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an electronic `` pseudogap '' on metallic tubes has been measured as predicted theoretically when curvature effects or intertube interactions are fully considered @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interference patterns have been observed in stm images close to defects such as chemical impurities , cap ends or in finite length nanotubes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these observations have been explained qualitatively from interference effects between the bloch waves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the molecular orbitals corresponding to the bloch states associated to the van hove singularities ( vhs ) have been less investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it has been predicted that , for defect - free semiconducting tubes , the electronic states would display broken symmetry effects in agreement with stm topographic images @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the specific signatures of such bloch states in metallic and semiconducting tubes can only be evidenced using local differential conductance spectroscopy , but experimental data are still scarce .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we report on a systematic study of the local densities of states ( ldos ) in defect - free swnts at various vhs using a low temperature stm . for semiconducting tubes , direct images of the two first highest occupied molecular - orbitals ( homo-1 , homo ) and lowest unoccupied molecular - orbitals ( lumo , lumo+1 ) </S>",
    "<S> states have been obtained . </S>",
    "<S> a spectacular c - c bond asymmetry is observed , revealing the complementarity in the symmetry of the respective wavefunctions . for metallic tubes , </S>",
    "<S> we observe the splittings of the first vhs and the occurrence of a pseudogap . as a consequence , the wavefunction symmetry breaking remains , which is demonstrated by conductance images showing strong symmetry variations within a few mev . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry analysis of the wavefunctions within an analytical tight - binding approach and calculations of stm images using density - functional based calculations in the tersoff - hamann formalism give a complete theoretical description of these findings .        </S>",
    "<S> [ [ semiconducting - tubes ] ] semiconducting tubes + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we present first a detailed study of a semiconducting tube . from the topographic image ( fig.[semicon]a ) , we estimate a chiral angle @xmath1 about 15@xmath21@xmath3 and a diameter of 1.4@xmath20.1 nm , leading to ( 15,5 ) chiral indices for the studied nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 spectra measured on the three different c - c bond orientations ( fig.[semicon]b ) exhibit four peaks at -0.78 , -0.37 , + 0.37 , and + 0.78 v , corresponding to four vhs denoted vhs-2 , vhs-1 , vhs+1 and vhs+2 , respectively ( fig.[semicon]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunctions at the corresponding energies will be denoted homo-1 , homo , lumo and lumo+1 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the most striking feature of the spectra is that the relative intensity of the vhs peaks is position - dependent . indeed , comparing the spectra measured above bond 1 and bond 2 , the four peaks vary in an alternate way , _ i.e. _ vhs-2 decreases while vhs-1 increases , vhs+1 decreases and vhs+2 increases . a similar variation is also observed between bond 2 and bond 3 but with a smaller amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.[semicon]d - g show energy - dependent differential conductance images ( @xmath4 maps ) of the semiconducting tube . </S>",
    "<S> the significant deformation of the hexagonal lattice is mostly due to the drift occuring during the long acquisition time needed for current imaging tunneling spectroscopy ( cits ) measurements as well as distorsion induced by the curvature of the nanotube @xcite . by contrast to the topography image which is energy integrated , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 maps reflect the ldos at a given energy . </S>",
    "<S> it clearly displays c - c bond asymmetry , while keeping the translational invariance of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> alternating image types are observed when going from homo-1 to lumo+1 : at -0.78 v , the intensity is maximum above bonds of type 1 , while at -0.37 v there is a node above bond 1 and maxima above bond 2 and 3 . at + 0.37 v </S>",
    "<S> the pattern is similar to homo-1 while at + 0.78 v it is similar to homo . </S>",
    "<S> these images demonstrate the complementary nature of the wavefunctions at the vhs energies , which is completely consistent with the asymmetries of the spectra shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ semicon]c . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the present measurements were performed far from the extremity of the tube and that the topographic image presents a hexagonal network with the same height for the 3 bond orientations and without any evidence of the presence of defects . </S>",
    "<S> such alternating patterns have been observed systematically on the semiconducting tubes , either individually lying on the substrate or assembled in bundles .    </S>",
    "<S> our observation are consistent with the general symmetry arguments in the reciprocal space put forward by kane and mele @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a chemist s approach in real space appears to be very fruitful also as we show now . </S>",
    "<S> we consider first the vhs of a semiconducting tube . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding bloch eigenstates have only a double trivial degeneracy @xmath5 , and @xmath6 lies in the vicinity of the @xmath7 point of the brillouin zone of the graphene sheet @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the rolling up of the sheet implies that @xmath6 should be on the so - called cutting lines parallel to the axis of the tube and separated by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the length of the chiral vector , equal to @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the diameter of the tube . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath12 are the usual coordinates of the chiral vector , the position of the cutting lines with respect to the @xmath7 point depends on the value of @xmath13 modulo 3 . in the case of a semiconducting tube , @xmath14 , and </S>",

    "<S> [ bz ]    the eigenstates @xmath22 are built from two independent bloch states @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> these two bloch states are linear combinations of atomic orbitals on the two sublattices 1 and 2 of the graphene structure , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the @xmath0 atomic orbital centred on site @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the ratio @xmath27 just introduces a phase factor related to the direction of the @xmath28 vector , _ _ </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath19 is in the opposite direction and the sign of @xmath27 changes . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate now the electronic density @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this involves an expansion in products of overlap functions @xmath33 . keeping the main contributions </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath34 either vanishes or is equal to a nearest neighbour vector , we obtain an expression for the local density of states @xmath35 , which is the quantity measured in sts . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 can be written as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the density of states , @xmath38 is the superposition of electronic atomic densities and @xmath39 is the interference term responsible for the breaking of the sixfold symmetry : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the angle between the tube axis and the bonds @xmath42 or @xmath43 , the chiral angle @xmath1 being here precisely defined as the smallest angle between a bond and the tube axis , @xmath44 .        because of the dependence on the sign of @xmath45 , the homo and lumo contributions are complementary . in the case of the second vhs , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath28 vector should be replaced by @xmath46 which shows that the singular contribution at the second vhs are also complementary of those of the first ones . </S>",
    "<S> finally images of tubes where @xmath31 are also complementary of those where @xmath16 since here the @xmath28 vector shoud be replaced by @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> . basically two types of images are therefore expected at the singularities depending on the sign in front of @xmath48 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rhoint ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we call images of type i the images corresponding to a positive sign . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the density above the bonds pointing close to the tube axis ( angle @xmath1 ) is reinforced , all the more when @xmath1 is small , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ close to a zig - zag orientation @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the complementary image ( image of type ii ) presents stripe reinforcements on the bonds perpendicular to the axis @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> close to an armchair orientation , the complementarity concerns principally the bonds close to the axis @xmath51 , the third one being unaffected @xmath52 . as can be seen in fig .   </S>",
    "<S> [ semicon ] our experimental results are completely typical of the behaviour when @xmath53 is close to one . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with our assignement ( 15,5 ) for the chiral indices : image of type i for the lumo state when @xmath16 @xcite .            </S>",
    "<S> this `` striping effect '' has been simulated in stm images for semiconducting nanotubes at bias corresponding to vhs @xmath2 1 within a tight binding approach @xcite . to validate further our analysis , </S>",
    "<S> we have performed first - principles calculations to simulate stm images on semiconducting zigzag ( 16,0 ) and ( 17,0 ) nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> the dos are reproduced on fig . </S>",

    "<S> fig [ </S>",
    "<S> dftsemicon]c - j show the simulated conductance images at energies of vhs-2 , vhs-1 , vhs+1 and vhs+2 for successively the ( 16,0 ) and ( 17,0 ) nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> stm simulations reproduce the `` striping effect '' experimentally observed . </S>",
    "<S> ( 16,0 ) is a @xmath16 tube and presents a type ii behaviour for homo and a type i for lumo in total agreement with measurements and tight - binding prediction on the 3p+1 tubes . </S>",
    "<S> simulations on ( 17,0 ) which is a @xmath31 tube exhibit a complementary behaviour i.e. a type i for homo and a type ii for lumo . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations demonstrate the validity of the tight - binding based interpretation presented above .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ metallic - tubes ] ] metallic tubes + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we present now sts results on a metallic tube . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ metallic1 ] shows spectra and @xmath4 maps associated with the first vhs . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , two kinds of image types are observed around each vhs . from the tight - binding model previously described , </S>",
    "<S> the vhs of metallic tubes correspond to the four states @xmath54 instead of the doubled degeneracy previously mentioned for semiconducting tubes . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of wavefunction symmetries , similar to the one presented before , do not predict the two observed complementary wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> however , because of the so - called trigonal warping effect the degeneracy between the states corresponding to opposite values of @xmath55 is lifted ( except for armchair nanotubes ) as observed experimentally and reproduced in calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then expect , as for semiconducting nanotubes , complementary images associated with the splitted vhs . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly visible in experimental conductance spectra . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ metallic1]c - f show indeed that bond 1 is reinforced at -0.81 v and bond 2 at -0.73 v. bond 3 , almost perpendicular to the axis , is less visible in both cases , as predicted for a tube close to an armchair orientation , ( @xmath56 ) . at positive bias , on the left hand side of the peak at 0.96 v , bond 1 </S>",
    "<S> is bright in the @xmath4 map ( fig.[metallic1]e ) as expected ( image of type i ) . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance image shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ metallic1]f is more complex due to the limited experimental resolution , but it exhibits brightest spots localized on bond 2 instead of bond 1 in fig.[metallic1]e . </S>",
    "<S> this is again in line with the tight binding description .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed complementary sequence can be shown to be consistent with the sign of the warping effect : image of type i for the lowest vhs at positive energy . to confirm this effect on splitted vhs of metallic tubes , we performed first principles simulations on a ( 8,5 ) nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated dos reported in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 85]a nicely reproduces the splitting of the vhs and also exhibit a dip around the fermi level which will be discussed later .    the calculated conductance images at the energies of the 4 peaks represented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 85]d - g show alternation of images of typei and ii confirming the broken sixfold symmetry on metallic tubes . </S>",
    "<S> this is totally consistent with the observation and tight binding prediction of striping effect at split vhs of metallic tubes .        </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with a significant observation of the symmetry breaking at the band edge of the pseudogap . </S>",
    "<S> the ldos in ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ metallic2](top ) ) measured by sts clearly shows a dip around the fermi level corresponding to the pseudogap . </S>",
    "<S> the di / dv maps recorded at -30 mv ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ metallic2]a ) and + 70 mv ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ metallic2]b ) exhibit complementary symmetry , type i at negative bias and type ii at positive bias . indeed , this small gap is characterized by a small @xmath57 perpendicular to the tube axis . </S>",
    "<S> complementary images of type i and ii are therefore also predicted in the tight - binding model at the lower and upper band edges , respectively , in nice agreement with our observations . </S>",
    "<S> the first principles of the ( 8,5 ) tube also confirms the striping effect at the pseudogap as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 85]b - c . </S>",
    "<S> the image at positive bias is complementary of the image at negative bias . </S>",
    "<S> moreover it is complementary of the image calculated at the first split vhs peak at positive bias ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 85]f ) confirming the alternation of symmetry observed experimentally .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that sts allows us to image directly the wavefunctions of carbon nanotubes associated with band edges and vhs . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunctions intensities present patterns with broken sixfold symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the images alternate systematically between only two types when going from one singularity to another . considering the homo orbital , for a @xmath58 tube the electron density </S>",
    "<S> is concentrated on the c - c having the smaller angle with the tube axis . for a @xmath59 electron density </S>",
    "<S> is maximum on the two other bonds . for a metallic tube ( 3p ) </S>",
    "<S> the sixfold symmetry is expected to be recovered . </S>",
    "<S> however the trigonal warping lifts the degeneracy and pairs of complementary orbitals are revealed around the energy position of the vhs . </S>",
    "<S> these results give a complete view of nanotubes molecular orbitals and allow to predict easily any wavefunction of any nanotube with a honeycomb lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this global picture is expected to provide essential insight for all cases where the symmetry relation between nanotubes orbitals and their surrounding is a key factor such as functionalization , transport devices or nanotubes sorting . </S>"
