    "the kuramoto model has been used to explore the dynamics of synchronization in a wide range of physical , chemical , and biological systems @xcite .",
    "it has also attracted a great deal of theoretical attention because of the analytical light it sheds on the various collective states and phase transitions that can occur in large systems of coupled nonlinear oscillators .    in kuramoto",
    "s original version of the model @xcite , the natural frequencies of the oscillators are distributed independently across the population according to a unimodal , symmetric probability distribution with density @xmath0 .",
    "this disorder in the oscillators frequencies tends to desynchronize them .",
    "opposing this disorder is an attractive pairwise coupling between the oscillators , of uniform strength @xmath1 , which tends to synchronize them .",
    "the rich behavior of the model results from the interplay of these competing forces .",
    "the governing equations of kuramoto s model are @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the phase of the @xmath4th oscillator and @xmath5 is its natural frequency . the model s simplifying assumptions of sinusoidal coupling and infinite - range interactions allowed kuramoto to obtain exact results for its stationary states in the limit @xmath6 , an impressive accomplishment given that the model is , mathematically , an infinite - dimensional nonlinear dynamical system with disorder .",
    "the analysis shows that the model s long - term behavior bifurcates from an incoherent state to a partially coherent state at a critical coupling strength @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a variant of the kuramoto model in which the couplings are distributed as well as the frequencies , but with a correlation between them .",
    "the governing equations are now given by @xmath8 following kuramoto @xcite and many subsequent workers , we assume the frequencies are selected from a lorentzian distribution given by @xmath9 having a half - width @xmath10 .",
    "the mean frequency is set to zero , @xmath11 , without loss of generality by going into a suitable rotating frame .",
    "we also introduce disorder in the couplings @xmath12 by choosing them from a distribution function @xmath13 . for simplicity , we take the double-@xmath14 distribution @xmath15 , \\label{eq : gammaxi_delta}\\ ] ]    so that half of the oscillators have positive coupling @xmath16 , and the other half have negative coupling @xmath17 .",
    "the positively coupled oscillators attract other oscillators toward them , which promotes global phase coherence .",
    "in contrast , negatively coupled oscillators tend to repel others , which inhibits global phase coherence .",
    "since there are equal numbers of positively and negatively coupled oscillators , it is not obvious which of these two competing forces will win out , though incoherence seems likelier , given the additional desynchronizing effects of the random frequencies .    in a previous study  @xcite , we found that when the random couplings are chosen _ independently _ of the random frequencies , the system does not show phase coherence .",
    "that result is consistent with what one would expect from a naive mean - field argument : if we replace the frequencies and couplings with their zero mean values , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , there s nothing driving the system toward coherence .",
    "these observations led us to consider the following questions : is phase coherence _ always _ impossible for a symmetric distribution of the disorder in which both the frequencies and couplings have zero mean ?",
    "what if these two types of disorder are _ correlated _ rather than independent ?",
    "furthermore , what happens if the inhomogeneities in the couplings and frequencies are chosen _ deterministically _ rather than randomly ?",
    "the purpose of the present work is to address these questions .",
    "note that since that the frequencies in eq .",
    "are deterministic , they comprise only one realization @xmath25 .",
    "we next choose the couplings @xmath26 .",
    "as stated , we wish to consider only the case when there are equal numbers of positively and negatively coupled oscillators . aside from this constraint , we are free to choose the couplings as we wish .",
    "we consider two separate choices , which we call _ symmetrically _ and _ asymmetrically _ correlated disorder .",
    "the couplings for the case of symmetrically correlated disorder are given by @xmath27    as illustrated in fig .",

    "collective phase synchronization is conveniently described by the complex order parameter @xmath35    where @xmath36 measures the phase coherence and @xmath37 denotes the average phase  @xcite .",
    "another order parameter we consider is @xmath38    which is a sort of weighted mean field .",
    "this quantity lets us rewrite eq .   as @xmath39",
    "next we use the traditional self - consistency approach to analyze the stationary states of the kuramoto model  @xcite . for such stationary states , the macroscopic variables @xmath40 and @xmath41 are all constant in time . from eq .",
    "we see that the individual oscillators can exhibit two types of behavior , depending on their natural frequency .",
    "those oscillators with @xmath42 approach stable fixed points given by @xmath43 , and are called  locked . \" the remaining oscillators with @xmath44 are called `` drifters . ''",
    "they rotate nonuniformly , and have stationary density @xmath45 found from requiring @xmath46 and imposing the normalization condition @xmath47 for all @xmath48 .",
    "this splitting of the system into locked and drifting populations allows us to derive an expression for @xmath49 self - consistently : @xmath50    by going to a suitable frame , we can set @xmath51 without loss of generality , so that @xmath52",
    ". then , @xmath53    as we vary the width @xmath10 of the frequency distribution , the quantity @xmath54 will have two branches .",
    "the first of these is when only oscillators with attractive coupling @xmath55 are locked , and the second is when oscillators with both @xmath55 and @xmath56 are locked .      to solve for the first branch , we begin by finding the maximum frequency of the oscillators with @xmath57 , which we call @xmath58 . as we see in eq .",

    "the requirement for the first branch is then @xmath69 .",
    "this follows from the fact that locked oscillators have @xmath70 and that all oscillators on @xmath71 have @xmath55 .",

    "the first is that there is a critical width @xmath82 beyond which phase coherence disappears ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the second is the scaling behavior at this critical point : @xmath84 with @xmath85 , which is same as that of conventional mean - field systems including the traditional kuramoto model  @xcite .      on the second branch we have @xmath86 .",
    "then the oscillators with @xmath87 have @xmath64 , and the other oscillators in @xmath88 and @xmath89 are locked oscillators with @xmath68 .",
