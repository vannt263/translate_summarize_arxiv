    "in 1961 , rolf landauer demonstrated a revolutionary principle which provided a definitive link between the information theory and thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "landauer s principle states that in any irreversible computation there is an unavoidable entropy production , manifested as heat , which is dissipated to the non - information bearing degrees of freedom of the computer .",
    "landauer discovered that this dissipated heat is bounded , from below , by the information theoretical entropy change .",
    "some years later charles bennett @xcite and independently oliver penrose @xcite used this principle to explain how to solve the long standing maxwell s demon problem in thermodynamics .",
    "the demon as first conceived by maxwell @xcite , and named by kelvin @xcite , has had an infamous and often controversial history which spans the entire development of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "controversies and philosophical issues aside , both the demon and landauer s principle have , at their core , simple but pragmatic applications .",
    "landauer s principle sets fundamental thermodynamic constraints for ( classical and quantum ) information processing .    almost half a century has passed and the landauer limit has finally been reached in several experiments on classical platforms @xcite .",
    "this delay is due to the fundamental difficulty of dealing with systems containing only a few degrees of freedom , where the fluctuations about average behavior are dominant . for these systems",
    "the concept of large numbers and hence any notion of thermodynamic equilibrium does not hold . however , the past 20 years we have seen a rapid progress in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics with the development of stochastic thermodynamics @xcite and the associated discovery of various fluctuation theorems @xcite . within this framework , thermodynamic quantities such as heat , work , and entropy now become stochastic variables described by appropriate probability distributions over individual phase space trajectories .",
    "this approach not only allows physicists to explore the ultimate thermodynamic limits of microscopic systems but also their information processing capabilities @xcite .    turning towards quantum systems",
    "@xcite , a picture of non - equilibrium thermodynamics has also emerged with thermodynamic quantities such as heat , work and entropy , being formulated as stochastic variables @xcite . as expected , in the quantum domain , the situation is even harder .",
    "the absence of a phase space picture due to intrinsic quantum uncertainty aside , one also has to cope with the necessity of performing invasive projective measurements on to a time dependent energy eigenbasis @xcite . until recently",
    ", this restrictive necessity has hindered experimental advances in studying the non - equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum systems .",
    "however , recent proposals have outlined that the quantum work distribution maybe extracted without the need of performing these direct measurements in favour of implementing phase estimation of an appropriately coupled ancilla @xcite , which samples the characteristic function of the distribution of the thermodynamic quantity .",
    "these schemes were recently implemented experimentally and allowed for the first verification of the quantum work fluctuation relations on a nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) system @xcite .    in this work we used a nuclear magnetic resonance setup to measure the heat dissipated in elementary quantum logic gates at the landauer limit .",
    "specifically , we consider a three qubit sample the system , the reservoir and the ancilla in order to measure the heat dissipated during the implementation of a global system - reservoir unitary that changes the information content of the system .",
    "we do this in two independent steps .",
    "first , by employing an interferometric technique , using the ancilla , we were able to reconstruct the heat distribution associated with the unitary process .",
    "secondly , through quantum state tomography we measure the change in the entropy of the system . in this way we were able to verify that an operation that changes the information content of the system must necessary generate heat in the reservoir , exactly as predicted by landauer s principle .",
    "the protocol used in this work allows the detailed study of irreversible entropy production in quantum information processors .     and the controlled operations @xmath1 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath2 are necessary to effectively make an interferometer .",
    "by varying the time @xmath3 of this operation the associated phase difference can be measured and , by appropriate measurements of the ancilla , we can reconstruct the characteristic function , given in eq .",
    ", of the distribution of heat dissipated to the reservoir . ]",
    "imagine a quantum system @xmath4 in state @xmath5 containing some information that we want to erase .",
    "we can then send the system through an erasure machine that reduces the amount of information in the system .",
    "landauer s principle relates the heat generated in the erasure machine to the change in the information entropy of the system .",
    "this relationship holds as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the average heat dissipated to the reservoir and @xmath8 is the change of von neumann entropy .",
    "the von neumann entropy is a measure of the information contained in a quantum state @xmath5 as @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "we will formally define @xmath10 below .",
    "the erasure machine performs a generalised quantum operation on @xmath4 , thus it can be represented by a completely positive trace preserving ( cptp ) map .",
    "any cptp map can be seen as contraction of unitary dynamics of @xmath4 along with a reservoir @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "recently reeb & wolf have shown that eq",
    ".   holds for processes satisfying the following criteria @xcite : ( i ) the process involves a system @xmath4 and a reservoir @xmath11 ; ( ii ) the initial @xmath12 state is uncorrelated , i.e. , @xmath13 ; ( iii ) the reservoir @xmath11 is initially in the gibbs state @xmath14 , with hamiltonian @xmath15 , inverse temperature @xmath16 . ] , and partition function @xmath17 $ ] ; ( iv ) the interaction between @xmath4 and @xmath11 is unitary : @xmath18 .    relaxing any of these four criteria can lead to violations of eq .  .",
    "thus we call processes satisfying the four criteria above as _ landauer processes_. the resultant dynamics on the system or the reservoir alone is non - unitary .",
    "this is responsible for generating heat in @xmath11 at the expense of changing the entropy of @xmath4 .",

    "that is , in a given run the reservoir may be in state @xmath23 , which has energy @xmath24 , with probability @xmath25 .",

    "these probabilities give us a distribution for the heat @xcite @xmath31 the first moment of this distribution , @xmath32 , is exactly the average heat of eq .  .",
    "if we can measure the entire heat distribution we can measure the average heat .",
    "however , due to the invasive nature of projective measurements , it is generally not easy to measure the heat distribution , rather we measure its corresponding characteristic function , @xmath33 , calculated by fourier transform to be @xmath34 ,   \\label{charfunction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a unitary transformation on @xmath11 .",

    "the expectation values for observable @xmath43 and @xmath44 on @xmath36 are directly related to the characteristic function @xmath45 .",

    "the fourier transform of the fid is the nmr spectrum .",
    "the total sample magnetization is proportional to the spectral area , being the proportionality factor dependent on only the electronic circuitry details and resonance frequencies @xcite . in the great majority of nmr experiments ,",

    "both these errors were extensively studied in @xcite .",

    "* errors in the heat *  the errors in the heat distribution are caused mainly by two sources .",
    "the first one is decoherence , which is discussed bellow .",
    "the second one , much more seriously because we can not correct it , is due to the numerical computation of the inverse fourier transform of the acquired data .",
    "for the determination of the characteristic function only one qubit is measured , which is equivalent to the measurement of the nuclear spin magnetization .",
    "this measurement can be achieved with high precision in nmr systems .",
    "the error bar for the experimental determination of the average heat was estimated from the standard deviation of the measured points for the characteristic function .",
    "then , we have used standard error propagation for calculating the error bars . in some cases ,",
    "the oscillations of characteristic function over time are small when compared with the average of @xmath140 , over time .",
    "when this happens we have a larger uncertainty .",
    "* decoherence *  the data acquisition time for the swap case varies appreciably , reaching around 150 ms .",
    "this is relatively long when compared with the transversal relaxation time for our sample ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mol ] ) .",
    "therefore , the signal lost due to decoherence is considerable and we need to take it into account . to do this we performed numerical simulations of the experiment considering the action of local phase damping channels , which is a very good model for the kind of noise we have @xcite .",
    "this noise will cause an exponential decay in the oscillations of the magnetization , whose inverse fourier transform will give us the heat distribution .",
    "the small discrepancies between the simulation and the experiment are mainly due to unwanted couplings not refocused and the inhomogeneity of the radio frequency fields .",
    "the net effect was to produce a constant shift in the data both for the heat distribution and for the entropies .",
    "we then employed this analysis to correct the final data for signal loss , leading us to the results presented in this work .",
    "the controlled - not gates are much faster and the signal loss was not significant .",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation , which is characterized by @xmath47 , causes no appreciable effect during the experiment for both gates .",

    "<S> we employ a nuclear magnetic resonance setup to experimentally address the information to energy conversion in a quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we consider a three nuclear spins @xmath0 ( qubits ) molecule the system , the reservoir and the ancilla to measure the heat dissipated during the implementation of a global system - reservoir unitary interaction that changes the information content of the system . by employing an interferometric technique we were able to reconstruct the heat distribution associated with the unitary interaction . </S>",
    "<S> then , through quantum state tomography , we measured the relative change in the entropy of the system . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we were able to verify that an operation that changes the information content of the system must necessary generate heat in the reservoir , exactly as predicted by landauer s principle . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme presented here allows for the detailed study of irreversible entropy production in quantum information processors . </S>"
