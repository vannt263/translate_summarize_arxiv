    "one of the foremost topics in modern nuclear physics is the study of exotic nuclei far beyond the stability line . a wide range of current experimental activities as well as new upcoming facilities , like fair at gsi and frib at msu ,",
    "will expand the knowledge of radioactive nuclei up to or close to the neutron drip line .",
    "a key issue of these investigations is to deepen the understanding of the nuclear interactions at large isospin asymmetries , which could also yield important input for the study of neutron stars , as the most neutron - rich system known .",
    "the knowledge of the properties , especially binding energies and estimates for lifetimes of neutron - rich isotopes is also crucial input for r - process nucleosynthesis calculations . in recent years",
    "there have been various studies of the structure of the neutron drip line @xcite . in the latter publication @xcite",
    "particle - stable uranium isotopes up to a neutron number of 204 were calculated .",
    "a number of recent studies suggest a drip line that might be less smooth as originally expected .",
    "results show potential peninsulae of isotopes sticking out into the area of unstable nuclei @xcite .",
    "other calculations suggest islands of ( meta-)stable nuclei beyond the drip line @xcite .",
    "+   + in the following we study very heavy nuclei , from uranium to rutherfordium and investigate the final neutron number that can be bound by the nucleus .",
    "the results show nuclei with extremely large neutron excess that are still stable with respect to neutron emission .",
    "this behavior is seen in a number of model approaches and parameter sets .",
    "the calculational framework used is a relativistic mean - field model ( rmf ) with a parametrization fitted to binding energies , diffraction and rms radii , and surface thicknesses of a set of nuclei @xcite as well as non - relativistic hartree - fock skyrme - type models for various sets of skyrme forces that were also used in the study of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "+   + the calculations were performed in spherical symmetry as well as in runs with deformation assuming axial symmetry .",
    "the equations were solved on a spatial grid in one and two dimensions to model the nuclei . in comparison",
    "the skyrme calculations were also done in a self - adapting harmonic oscillator basis , where the oscillator asymmetries are adjusted iteratively to minimize the binding energy by allowing for nuclear deformations .",
    "+   + we employed a bcs - type pairing , where we used delta force pairing for the relativistic and skyrme calculations on the grid and constant force for the calculations using a harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "certainly , improvements of the pairing description should be done in future investigations , however , the basic qualitative results most likely will not be affected . +   +",
    "our numerical results of a spherical calculation of uranium isotopes are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "one can see the total energy of the nuclei as function of neutron number .",
    "the curve exhibits an absolute minimum at @xmath0 ( in the case of the relativistic force ) , signaling the last neutron - stable isotope .",
    "several results for rmf and skyrme calculations as well as for a relativistic effective chiral lagrangian @xcite have been obtained most of them exhibiting a minimum at large neutron number . in the chiral lagrangian",
    "the baryonic masses are generated via spontaneous symmetry breaking that generate non - vanishing vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields .",
    "the quality of the model in reproducing knwon nuclear structure data is comparable to other relativistic models @xcite . as it is based on a flavor - su(3 ) description the nucleons also couple weakly to the strange scalar field that corresponds to the strange quark condensate .",
    "this approach does not show a significant increase of bound neutrons with z. here a shell closure around @xmath1 only develops at much higher atomic charge of @xmath2 .",

    "+   + looking at the density distribution of protons and neutrons in the case of the extreme nucleus @xmath0 ( nl - z2 ) one observes an outer shell of essentially pure neutron matter as can be seen in fig .",
    "the neutron skin of this nucleus results as @xmath8 the isospin asymmetry of such a nucleus @xmath9 is quite substantial compared to a value of 0.7 - 1 inside of a neutron star or a value of less than 0.22 for a @xmath10pb nucleus .",

    ", @xmath11 was estimated using koopmans theorem @xcite .",
    "the results for a spherical and a two - dinemsional calculation are shown , which are in agreement with each other pointing to the fact that at this neutron number the nuclei are spherical .",
    "one can observe that for @xmath13 @xmath12 just crosses the zero line yielding nuclei that are stable with respect to 2 ( and 1 ) neutron emission .",
    "however , as can be seen in table [ nmax ] , for @xmath14 this state becomes the most stable nucleus in the isospin chain for this particular skyrme parametrization .",
    "thus one can observe the development of similar metastable peninsulas along the neutron drip line as had been observed in @xcite .",
    "we have calculated heavy nuclei with extreme neutron numbers .",
    "nuclei with up to 258 neutrons are shown to be stable in a range of self - consistent model calculations .",
    "it is interesting to note that one can achieve self - bound largely neutron system with an asymmetry of 0.48 . it might be worthwhile to correlate the existence of the states in various models with neutron star observables . at the moment",
    "the calculation is largely a theoretical exercise as it is not clear how to produce such nuclei in a realistic experimental setup in measurable quantities , even if , in principle , a lead - lead collision , for example , would contain enough neutrons .",
    "recent speculations on using high - intensity pulsed neutron sources from reactors for producing large - n nuclei @xcite sound like a potentially very interesting new experimental idea for producing very neutron - rich nuclei , but this approach is still very far from practical realization . in the same vein , for now at least there is no scenario predicting production of such states in a realistic astrophysical environment , although similar states might occur in the crust of neutron stars",
    ". however , the knowledge of the boundary of particle - stable nuclei in itself is still a question of fundamental interest in studies of strong - interaction physics .",
