    "almost all analytic studies of stochastic reaction dynamics utilize a small noise gaussian approximation .",
    "this assumption emerges naturally , for example , in the van kampen system - size expression  @xcite where the fluctuations in particle number are formally lower order and hence are treated as small and centered around the mean value set by the deterministic reaction equations .",
    "the initial purpose of this paper is to point out that this approach may give highly misleading results especially when some of the downstream reactions are nonlinear .",
    "we do this by studying a specific example , that of an incoherent feedforward module processing data from a small number of receptors  @xcite .",
    "afterwards , we show how an alternate approach for the rapid activation versus slow inhibition limit can provide a complementary analytic approach .",
    "the example we choose to study is a part of the gradient sensing module underlying the chemotactic response of dictyostelium cells  @xcite .",
    "these cells appear to implement a control circuit incorporating a simple incoherent feedforward loop topology for adapting out the constant concentration background  @xcite .",
    "this circuit is instantiated by using a ras - gef as a positive signal and ras - gap as the complementary inhibitor  @xcite .",
    "these are both activated upon the binding of camp by the g - protein coupled camp receptor and in turn drive the signaling hub protein ras into its active ( gtp - bound ) , respectively inactive ( gdp - bound ) form .",

    "it is trivial to verify that if @xmath2 is a constant signal , the steady - state value of @xmath1 , @xmath5 does not depend on its value .",
