    "[ sec : intr ] understanding the dynamics of disk galaxies is essential to the vetting process of theories of galaxy formation and cosmology ( @xcite ) .",
    "disk galaxies moderately inclined to the line of sight ( 50 - 80@xmath5 ) can provide an hi rotation curve from which the dark matter ( dm ) content and distribution can be deduced in the context of newtonian dynamics ( @xcite )",
    ". however , there exist degeneracies between the dm halo density profile , the stellar mass - to - light ratios of the stellar components and the scale - height of the stellar disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "the vertical stellar distribution is assumed to be a declining exponential on both sides of the mid - plane .",
    "thus , the scale - height of the stellar disk is simply the exponential rate at which the stellar luminosity density drops , with increasing height above or below the mid - plane of the disk .",
    "it is assumed to be constant with radius , which is supported by observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath0 ) is the ratio between the mass of a stellar population and the luminosity , as observed through a particular bandpass .",
    "it can not be observed directly , so it is ordinarily inferred by numerical stellar population synthesis models .",
    "this modelling crucially depends on the star - formation and chemical enrichment history considered and on the initial mass function ( imf ; @xcite ) .",
    "the imf is the spectrum of stellar types formed given a molecular cloud of certain initial mass , metallicity and other relevant properties .",
    "it therefore has the scope to vary from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "in addition to the imf , stellar population synthesis models have other sources of uncertainty ( @xcite ) .    in standard fitting of rotation curves of highly inclined disk galaxies ,",
    "it is common to invoke the `` maximum disk hypothesis '' , ( @xcite ) i.e. that the stellar disk contributes maximally to the rotation curve .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by observations that deduce the microlensing optical depth in the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( @xcite ) and measurements that place the co - rotation radius of barred galaxies just beyond the end of the bar ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it yields values for the @xmath0 that are typically in accordance with the predictions of stellar population synthesis models .",
    "this , however , does not demonstrate that the hypothesis is correct ( see e.g. @xcite ) and it would be ideal to have a robust , independent measurement that breaks the disk mass degeneracy .",
    "this is theoretically possible because the @xmath0 can be determined dynamically through the vertical velocity dispersions of stars over the full projected area of the galactic disk , if the scale - height is known ( @xcite ) . for close to edge - on disk galaxies , however",
    ", one can not measure the vertical velocity dispersion and thus the technique is limited to only those galaxies with moderate inclinations to the line of sight ( @xmath6 ) , where @xmath7 is seen as optimal ( @xcite ; hereafter dmsii ) .    in order to break the degeneracy between the dm halo and @xmath0 ,",
    "the diskmass survey ( dms ; @xcite ; hereafter dmsi ) made observations of the line of sight velocity dispersion profiles of 46 nearly face - on disk galaxies ( dmsi ) : 30 of which have been published and a further 100 are part of the larger survey .",
    "they also measured their surface brightness profiles and rotation curves .",
    "there were two further , essential ingredients in the analysis that come from scaling relations .",
    "the first is the luminous tully - fisher ( tf ) relation between the absolute magnitude of a galaxy and a measure of its outer rotation speed .",
    "this helps to isolate the inclination of the galaxy , which for nearly face - on galaxies can otherwise be obtained using the tilted disk method of @xcite .",
    "the second is the correlation between the disk stellar scale - height , a measure of the thickness of the disk , and scale - length , a measure of the radial extent .",
    "this relationship is explored in detail by dmsii ( their  2.2 ) , and is derived from the studies of @xcite ( hereafter k02 ) and @xcite . this allowed @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter dmsvi and dmsvii ) to infer the @xmath0 of the disk .",
    "the data imply that the stellar disks are `` sub - maximal '' ( k - band @xmath8 or lower , see @xcite ) which means they do _ not _ contribute maximally to the rotation curve in the central regions , contrary to the value found from population synthesis models that assume a kroupa imf ( @xmath9 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this leaves more room for dm in the central regions .",
    "modified newtonian dynamics ( mond @xcite , see @xcite for a recent review ) is a theory which proposes a modification of dynamics whose impact is most apparent in regions of low acceleration .",
    "most current working versions of mond consist of an actual modification of gravity , i.e. , at the classical level , a modification of the newtonian poisson equation ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "this modification occurs due to the hypothesised existence of a new constant of physics with dimensions of acceleration , @xmath10 . for accelerations much stronger than this threshold , @xmath11",
    ", there is no discerned deviation from newtonian gravity . however , far below the threshold the true acceleration perceived by a test mass is found from @xmath12 - where @xmath13 is the expected newtonian gravitational field .",
    "@xcite and @xcite made studies of the vertical dynamics of the galaxy in mond , showing that it could be possible to distinguish between mond and the dm paradigm with data from the milky way .",
    "the extra constraint on the dynamics from vertical velocity dispersions in nearly face - on disks of external galaxies provides a new test of this hypothesis .",
    "this article addresses whether mond can simultaneously account for the measured vertical velocity dispersions and rotation curves , while keeping in line with galaxy scaling relations .    in section 2",
    "the framework is presented for the joint modelling of galaxy rotation curves and stellar vertical velocity dispersions in the mond context . in section 3",
    "the methods are discussed and this includes a discussion of the bulge - disk decomposition , the accuracy of the poisson solver , and the observational error budget for the main data . in section 4",
    "the primary results are presented , this includes a discussion of the fits to the vertical dynamics and rotation curves , the confidence ranges of the fitted parameters , and how well the fitted parameters mesh with other observations . in section 5 possible scenarios that could alter the results",

    "[ sec : bardens ] the last question here is the distribution of @xmath20 . the derivation of the contribution from atomic and molecular gas is described in dmsvii . both are assumed to have non - smooth , axisymmetric , radial surface densities .",

    "there are typically two stellar components , a bulge and a disk .",

    "simultaneously , the disk luminosity density can be expressed with a simple form    [ eqn : jdisk ] j_d(r , z)=l_d 4h_r^2h_z(-r h_r)(-|z| h_z ) , where @xmath31 is the total luminosity of the disk , @xmath32 is the scale - length and @xmath1 is the scale - height .",
    "the vertical distribution is characterised by the exponential function , but the commonly used @xmath33 function ( @xcite ) would be equally appropriate . here",
    "@xmath34 is the @xmath35 scale - height which corresponds to @xmath36 at large @xmath37 .",
    "using the @xmath35 vertical distribution does not change the conclusions ( see  [ sec : sech ] ) .    in general , the surface density can be found by integrating along the line of sight . for a face - on galaxy ,",
    "the luminosity density of eq  [ eqn : jdisk ] can be projected to give the surface brightness    [ eqn : sigdisk ] i_d(r)=l_d 2h_r^2(-r h_r ) . here",
    "the density profiles are always assumed to be smooth . to find the mass density of the bulge and disk , the luminosity densities of the bulge and the disk must be multiplied by their respective @xmath0 so that    [ eqn : massdens ] _ * = _ bj_b+_dj_d , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the stellar @xmath0 values of the bulge and disk respectively . the total density of baryons is then @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the atomic and molecular gas density . as stated previously , in mond",
    ", @xmath21 is equivalent to the total mass density , @xmath20 ( eq  [ eqn : newtpois ] ) , because there is no dm in mond galaxies . for newtonian gravity @xmath42 .    for the baryonic mass models , there are 8 parameters : @xmath43 .",
    "of those 9 , the surface brightness parameters are either directly observed or unambiguously fitted to the surface brightness profile .",
    "this leaves only @xmath44 .",
    "since the dms sample is chosen so that the total bulge luminosity to total disk luminosity is low , @xmath38 is relatively insignificant and is never independently varied in the modelling performed here ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath46 and @xmath1 are the only two free parameters that are relevant to a theory like mond . in principle",
    ", the inclination of the galaxy also has a small amount of freedom but it is strongly curtailed by the luminous tf relation .",
    "the aforementioned free parameters are fitted for through a simultaneous comparison of the model vertical velocity dispersions and rotation curves with the observed ones , as is described in ",
    "[ sec : errors ] .",
    "[ sec : inc ] the derivation of the rotation curve of a moderate or high - inclination disk galaxy from the measured 2d velocity field , permits the fitting of tilted rings ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these tilted rings allow us to model the variation in the inclination and position angle of numerous concentric annuli at different galactocentric radii .",
    "the inclinations of the various rings , as a function of radius , can vary by 10@xmath5 ( e.g. @xcite ) depending on the quality of the data , the regularity of the velocity field and characteristic inclination of the disk .",
    "the dms galaxies have low inclinations ( they are close to face - on ) , thus the inclination has a lot of leverage on the inferred rotation speed because of the shape of the sine function .",
    "it is possible to derive accurate kinematic inclinations for nearly face - on disks using the tilted disk ( as opposed to tilted ring ) technique of @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to infer the inclination using the luminous tf relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "this relates the absolute k - band magnitude of the galaxy , @xmath47 , to a measure of the outer rotation speed , @xmath48 such that [ eqn : tfr ] v_f=0.5 10^(5.12-m_k)/11.3  .",
    "anderson et al . ( 2015 , in prep ) have determined that the kinematic and tf inclinations for the diskmass galaxies generally agree well , although there are some outliers .    relating the measured",
    ", inclined outer rotation velocity @xmath49 with the expected outer velocity from the tf relation ( eq  [ eqn : tfr ] ) allows the expected inclination to be deduced .",
    "this inclination is only that expected for the outer parts of the rotation curve , and thus the inner parts can vary somewhat due to a warp .",
    "in addition to the luminous tf relation , there is a baryonic tf relation ( @xcite ) which relates the total baryonic mass of a galaxy to its outer , flat rotation speed , where @xmath50 .",
    "this relation is fundamental to mond and the exponent @xmath51 and the constant of proportionality @xmath11 are predictions which agrees well with the observed relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the mond baryonic tf relation can be written in a similar form to eq  [ eqn : tfr ] as    [ eqn : btfr ] v_f^4 ga_0=m_g+(_bf_b+_df_d)10^(m_k ,- m_k)/2.5 . here ,",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 are the fractions of the total luminosity contributed by the bulge and disk respectively .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the sun in the k - band is @xmath54 ( @xcite ) and @xmath55 is the gas mass .",
    "it was found that the inclinations from eq  [ eqn : btfr ] are typically between 5 - 15% larger than those found with eq  [ eqn : tfr ] , depending on the @xmath0 used ( here the @xmath0 was taken to be between 0.6 and 1 ) : a smaller @xmath0 implies a smaller corresponding rotation velocity , hence a larger inclination .    for a large enough sample there",
    "should , in principle , be no systematic deviation from either tf relation . when modelling rotation curves in general , it is not always clear when the rotation curve has reached the terminal velocity , so some margin of error must be granted . since eq  [ eqn : tfr ] has no dependence on @xmath0 , and to make it easier to compare with the dms results , the luminous tf relation inclinations ( eq  [ eqn : tfr ] ) are used in this article .",
    "[ sec : svvd ]      [ sec : csve ]    in addition to the measured rotation curve , the dms also measured the line of sight velocity dispersion profile of the stars over the full projected area of the disk .",

    "generally , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are expected to take on certain values from measurements in the solar neighbourhood ( @xcite ) , and @xmath61 is presumed to take on specific values from the epicycle approximation . however , beyond the milky way their variation is not empirically well known ( see discussion in sect 2.1 of dmsii , and also @xcite ) . by choosing galaxies that are nearly face - on",
    ", the dms reduces their importance ( cf .",

    "[ sec : modsvvd ]    in order to compare with the observations , the model vertical velocity dispersions of the galaxies must be computed .",
    "the vertical velocity dispersion at a height @xmath37 above the mid - plane , at a radial distance @xmath14 from the centre of the disk galaxy is found from ( see @xcite )    [ eqn : rho * ] _ * ( r , z)_z(r , z)^2=_z^_*(r , z)d_tot(r , z ) dzdz , and the equivalent of the observed vertical velocity dispersion at any radius , r , weighted by the local stellar surface density is given by    [ eqn : sig * ] _ * ( r)_z(r)^2=_-^_*(r , z)_z(r , z)^2 dz .",

    "eq  [ eqn : sigred ] depends mainly on 2 fitted parameters : @xmath39 and @xmath1 . as stated previously , inclination could also be varied but only in a tight range around the tf relation values .",
    "thus , combining simultaneous fits to the observed rotation curves and vertical velocity dispersions is a strong test of the mond paradigm .",
    "it is worth noting that the infinite potential well of isolated galaxies in mond is irrelevant here since the vertical gravitational field in eq  [ eqn : rho * ] is convolved with the exponentially declining stellar density , and thus the mond gravity is only relevant where there are stars .",

    "the gas disk was subtracted .",
    "this left the stellar disk surface density , @xmath66 .",
    "this also includes an unknown component of dm .",
    "the stellar @xmath0 as a function of radius was given by @xmath67 .",
    "an average of this @xmath0 out to a given radius then defines the quoted disk @xmath0 .",
    "this approach , although straight - forward , is only accurate when the derivative of the rotation curve is small .",
    "it is also not transferable to mond because of the non - linearity of the theory and that the @xmath0 in mond affects both the rotation curve and vertical velocity dispersion .",
    "it is more secure to make the reverse calculation and go from observed surface brightness , sample a @xmath0 to give surface density , then use eq  [ eqn : sigred ] to give a model vertical velocity dispersion which can be compared with the observed vertical velocity dispersions .",
    "however , this requires calculation of the full three dimensional potential from a model galaxy - which is performed here .",
    "[ sec : bdd ] the inclination corrected surface brightness profiles presented by dmsvi were analysed with a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach to fit bulge plus disk surface brightness models using eqs  [ eqn : sersic ] and [ eqn : sigdisk ] .",
    "the seeing was simultaneously accounted for with a gaussian convolution of appropriate radius ( see tables 3 and 4 of dmsvii ) .",
    "all 5 surface brightness parameters ( 2 disk and 3 bulge ) were fitted , but the bulge surface brightness parameters were found to be degenerate with each other due to seeing effects and the lack of data points at low radii .",
    "thus , the bulge parameters were fixed at the maximum likelihood values , which allowed better sampling of the more important disk parameters . in figs  [ fig :",
    "like0]-[fig : like2 ] the posterior probability distributions are presented for the two disk surface brightness parameters of each galaxy . for the disk scale - length ,",
    "the range found by dmsvi ( red curve ) is also plotted .",
    "the best fits to the surface brightness profiles are given in figs  [ fig:1like0]-[fig:1like2 ] and are generally good . both linear radius and log radius",
    "are plotted on the @xmath68-axis to expose the quality of the fits to the bulge and the outer disk .",
    "the fitted scale - lengths found here ( see figs  [ fig : like0]-[fig : like2 ] ) are generally consistent with those fitted by the dms , although theirs have smaller error ranges .",
    "once the bulge and disk surface brightness profiles were established , an abel transform was used to de - project the bulge surface brightness , which was stored numerically .",
    "the disk has cylindrical symmetry , so it does not require de - projection . following this ,",
    "rejection sampling was used to generate n - particle representations of the galaxies , with half of all particles representing the stellar disk and the other half split evenly between the stellar bulge and the atomic and molecular gas disks .",
    "the fitted scale - lengths are used for all the following analysis , but they are not used to generate the n - particle representations of the stellar disk .",
    "instead , the `` observed '' surface brightness of the disk is sampled after subtracting the fitted bulge - since the fit to the surface brightness can be poor at large radii .    in this analysis",
    "the static n - particle representations are only used to find the potential and gravitational field , there is no n - body evolution of the simulated galaxies .",
    "the masses recovered after generating the n - particle representations of each component of each galaxy generally agreed very well with the masses reported by the dms .",

    "the code solves the modified poisson equation of the quasi - linear version of mond ( qumond ) given by eq  [ eqn : mondpois ] .",
    "the code uses a 3d grid and the cloud - in - cell technique to numerically discretise the 3d density of an n - particle distribution .",
    "it then employs finite differencing and multigrid methods to iterate from a test potential to the final potential which accurately reflects the density .",

    "the agreement is generally very good , except for small heights above the disk .",
    "this is due to a combination of the limit of spatial resolution at large radii , owing to the centrally refining mesh , and limited particles at large radii . the average percentage error for these discrete radii ( 3.5 , 8.5 , 11.5 , 14.5 , 18.5 and 25.5  kpc ) between the numerical calculation of @xmath56 ( using eq  [ eqn : sigred ] ) and the theoretical values are 0.05 , 0.8 , 0.7 , 5.8 , 5.2 and 4.4% . given that only 6 of the 30 galaxies have vertical velocity dispersion data points beyond 11  kpc and the errors on those data points are typically more than 10% , this is more than adequate .    in the bottom two panels of fig  [ fig : grav ] the newtonian ( black lines ) and",

    "such thin disks are strongly at odds with observations .",
    "all other key parameters involved in analysing the dms data in mond were modelled , such as the stellar velocity dispersion ellipsoid parameters , inclination , the choice of stellar vertical distribution profile , the mond acceleration parameter and interpolating function .",
    "no clear way was found to reconcile mond with the data .",
    "if the derived rotation velocities were lowered , by imposing 30 - 40% higher inclinations , it became possible to simultaneously fit the low vertical velocity dispersions and low rotation speeds with low values for the stellar @xmath0 . by design ,",
    "since the outer rotation speeds are fitted , this is in accordance with the mondian baryonic tf relation ( with logarithmic slope fixed to 4 , eq  [ eqn : btfr ] ) . despite this , these circular velocities are inconsistent with the _ luminous _ tf relation which is quite well established for high - inclination galaxies . to this end",
    ", it would be interesting to make a fully self - consistent analysis that models the effect of the varying inclination on the two dimensional velocity fields and the surface brightness profiles .",
    "a prediction was made for the scaling of the central dynamical surface density versus central surface luminosity density in mond and compared with the dms galaxies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "mond correctly predicts that the low surface luminosity density galaxies deviate from the simple relation @xmath97 .",
    "in addition to viewing mond as a modification of the law of gravity , @xcite has maintained that a modification of inertia might be better positioned to explain all available galactic dynamics data . in such a theory , the orbital trajectories of particles would have different inertias meaning the interpolating function in the radial direction would differ from the vertical directions .",
    "this is an intriguing possibility since the problem with mond outlined here is that for the radial force defined by a galaxy , the corresponding vertical force is too large .",
    "it is interesting therefore that the vertical velocity dispersions of disk galaxies must increase to agree with mond , but the observed radial velocity dispersions of some dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( @xcite ) must decrease .",
    "this anecdotal evidence should be followed up with more rigorous study .",
    "something worth further investigation is the impact from super - thin disks , much thinner than the observed scale - heights represented here ( @xcite ) , on the measurement of vertical velocity dispersions by the dms survey .",
    "specifically , how prominent are super - thin disks in all disk galaxies , and are the vertical velocity dispersions that the dms measures meaningfully influenced by them ?",
    "the super - thin disk found by @xcite was truncated at around 3  kpc , suggesting the influence is minimal .",
    "as discussed in dmsi , it is expected that stars in or near the mid - plane diffuse over time .",
    "the youngest stars may contribute to the light because of the ob stars , but they contribute little to the absorption lines , because those ob stars have weak spectral features ( except for h and he ) .",
    "it is possible to make even stronger claims about the status of mond - like theories , as well as conventional dynamics , with certain desiderata . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", this would be a detailed study of the impact of the neglected cross - term ( tilt of the velocity ellipsoid ) in eq  [ eqn : sigred ] . from an observational point of view ,",
    "a larger sample of edge - on galaxies ( like k02 ) with near - infrared photometry , to more precisely confirm the correlation between scale - length and scale - height .",
    "it would also be beneficial to have an increased sample of nearly face - on galaxies , with measured stellar velocity dispersions and rotation curves and with greater sensitivity to be able to measure the stellar velocity dispersions to larger radii .",

    "<S> the reason is that modified gravity versions of mond characteristically require a larger @xmath0 to fit the rotation curve in the absence of dark matter and therefore predict a stronger vertical gravitational field than newtonian models . </S>",
