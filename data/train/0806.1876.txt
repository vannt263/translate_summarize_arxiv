    "the cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements presented in the 5-year data of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) provide the most comprehensive characterization to date of the perturbations present in the early universe at the time of photon - baryon decoupling @xcite .",
    "the microwave background polarization field is conventionally decomposed into a sum of parity - even ( `` e - type '' ) and parity - odd ( `` b - type '' ) parts ; since b - type polarization is absent in a cosmological scenario involving only scalar density perturbations , it serves as a powerful test of other cosmological physics , including primordial tensor and vector metric perturbations @xcite .",
    "another source of b - type polarization is faraday rotation of the orientation of linear polarization due to the presence of a cosmological magnetic field : if a purely e - type polarization pattern is everywhere rotated by @xmath2 , it becomes a purely b - type polarization .",
    "smaller rotation angles generate a component of b - type polarization from an initial pure e - type polarization field .",
    "faraday rotation of polarized radiation is in general a powerful tool to estimate magnetic field amplitudes and spectra ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . in the cosmological context ,",
    "kosowsky and loeb @xcite proposed microwave background faraday rotation to probe a homogeneous primordial magnetic field ; this issue has been re - addressed by several authors for the homogeneous field @xcite , as well as for a stochastic field @xcite . for a homogeneous field ,",
    "the same polarization rotation effect additionally induces non - zero parity - odd cross correlations between microwave temperature and b - polarization anisotropies and e - polarization and b - polarizations anisotropies @xcite and correlations between different multipoles @xcite which are absent for standard cosmological scenarios .",
    "primordial magnetic fields are interesting because they could serve as seed fields for the observed magnetic fields in galaxies and galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "similar effects ( microwave background birefringence and parity - odd anisotropy spectra ) may also have non - magnetic explanations .",
    "in particular , microwave background polarization plane rotation occurs in models with violation of parity symmetry and/or lorentz invariance in the early universe @xcite .",
    "parity - odd polarization anisotropy spectra appear due to gravitational lensing @xcite or non - zero primordial magnetic helicity @xcite .    here",
    "we use wmap 5-year b - polarization power spectrum upper limits @xcite to place limits from faraday rotation on a stochastic primordial magnetic field .",
    "we assume that the cosmological magnetic field was generated during or prior to the early radiation - dominated epoch . the high conductivity of the primordial plasma results in a `` frozen - in '' magnetic field , fixing the temporal dependence to be the simple scaling @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the scale factor and @xmath5 conformal time . throughout this paper",
    ", @xmath6 represents the comoving value of the magnetic field .",
    "we also normalize the scale factor @xmath4 by setting @xmath7 today , and we employ cosmological units with @xmath8 and gaussian units for electromagnetic quantities .",
    "electromagnetic waves propagating in a magnetized medium have the plane of their linear polarization rotated ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . a linearly polarized wave can be expressed as a superposition of left and right circularly polarized waves .",
    "the magnetic field induces a phase velocity difference between the two circular polarization , resulting in rotation of the polarization plane . the rotation angle @xmath9 for a plane wave with comoving frequency @xmath10 propagating in the direction @xmath11 satisfies @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the differential optical depth , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the comoving electron number density and ionization fraction , @xmath16 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath17 is the magnitude of the electron charge .",
    "faraday rotation of the microwave background is a subtle problem , because the polarization is generated and rotated simultaneously in the region of the last scattering surface .",
    "however , as long as the total rotation is small compared to @xmath18 , the total rotated polarization angle can be expressed simply as an average of the rotated polarization angle from each infinitesimal piece of path length through the surface of last scattering , neglecting depolarization effects @xcite .",
    "when considering a stochastic magnetic field , we make the simplifying approximation that any magnetic field component with a wavelength shorter than the thickness of the surface of last scattering is neglected : for these components , the rotation of polarization generated at different optical depths will tend to cancel , leaving little net rotation .",
    "then we can treat the magnetic field as constant throughout the rotation region , so that the total rotation , which is the sum over the rotations of each infinitesimal piece of generated polarization , can be expressed as the total rotation incurred by the polarization generated at some particular effective optical depth ( for details see @xcite . )    a gaussian random magnetic field is described by the two - point correlation function in wavenumber space as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the magnetic field power spectrum , vanishing for all wavenumber larger than the damping scale @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the plane projector , and @xmath23 .",
    "we use the fourier transform convention @xmath24 .",
    "( we neglect nonzero magnetic helicity since it does not affect the polarization plane rotation @xcite . )",
    "the power spectrum @xmath20 is related to the total energy density @xmath25 of the magnetic field through @xmath26 , and it is given by simple power law @xmath27 .",
    "smoothing the field on a comoving scale @xmath28 by convolving with a gaussian smoothing kernel , the smoothed magnetic field amplitude @xmath29 is @xcite @xmath30 we assume that the magnetic field cut - off scale is determined by the alfven wave damping scale @xcite , @xmath31 which will always be a much smaller scale than the silk damping scale ( thickness of the last scattering surface ) for standard cosmological models .    for a given comoving radiation frequency @xmath10 , consider the rotation angle @xmath32 of the microwave background linear polarization as a function of sky direction @xmath11 . for a stochastic magnetic field , it is obvious that the rotation angle averaged over the sky is zero .",
    "expanding the rotation angle in spherical harmonics leads to the definition of the angular power spectrum @xmath33 via @xmath34 where @xmath35 are legendre polynomials .",
    "the rotation angle power spectrum due to a stochastic magnetic field is @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 are spherical bessel functions .",
    "this rotation multipole expression contains a sharp short - wavelength cutoff @xmath21 in the magnetic field ; in reality , the effective cutoff will be smoothly spread over a range of scales . given this rotation angle power spectrum , we need to compute the b - polarization power spectrum induced by the rotation field from the primordial e - polarization . this is given by eq .",

    "our range of spectral indices is based on plausible magnetic field generation mechanisms @xcite and spectral indices which are not excluded by other bounds ; see refs .",
    "the input @xmath59 values up to @xmath60 were calculated using cmbfast @xcite for the best - fit wmap cosmological model .",
    "the obtained set of @xmath54 is then further rescaled as @xmath61 and @xmath62 to obtain theoretical @xmath54 for different values of magnetic field amplitude and scale , respectively .",
    "wmap data @xcite covers five frequency bands with central frequencies ranging from 23 ghz to 94 ghz .",
    "we use the measured b - polarization power spectrum limits for the three highest - frequency wmap bands centered at 41 , 61 , and 94 ghz ( q , v , and w ) ; our limits could be improved by including information from the lowest two frequency channels , but these are dominated by synchrotron foregrounds .",
    "we use only data for @xmath63 , for which we can treat measurement errors for different @xmath58 values as uncorrelated .",
    "most of the constraining power of the data comes from multipoles between @xmath64 and @xmath52 , as displayed in fig .  1 , where the theoretical signal begins to be comparable to the errors on the data points ; neglecting the data with @xmath65 only marginally affects the limits obtained here .",
    "the theoretical @xmath67 power spectra are compared with the wmap data using @xmath68 statistics .",
    "we conservatively include an extra 40% error on theoretical @xmath67 values to compensate for using the nominal frequency center of each wmap band rather than the detailed frequency response of each band .",
    "theoretical uncertainties on calculated values of @xmath59 are neglected , since these are much smaller than the experimental uncertainties on wmap data .",
    "as the data is consistent with the hypothesis of @xmath69 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : comparison_nb29_5ng ] ) , we set limits on values of @xmath29 as a function of @xmath57 and @xmath66 .",

    "these results presume that b - polarization signal is totally due to the faraday rotation effect",
    ". other possible source of b - polarization , such as inflationary gravitational waves @xcite , gravitational lensing @xcite or non - zero primordial magnetic helicity @xcite , will strengthen the magnetic field limits derived here .",
    "a primordial magnetic field on a scale @xmath71 mpc must have an amplitude @xmath29 of less than @xmath72 g for any power spectrum between @xmath70 and @xmath73 .",
    "these limits are weaker that those obtained recently in refs .",
    "improvements on this limit using the faraday rotation signal will be challenging , requiring substantially more sensitive polarization measurements at frequencies of 50 ghz or below ; most current or planned high - sensitivity polarization experiments use bolometer detection technology , which tend to lose sensitivity in this frequency range .",
    "upcoming measurements from the lfi instrument on planck will be of roughly comparable polarization sensitivity to the wmap measurements at similar frequencies .",
    "one notable effort is the quiet experiment @xcite , which uses coherent detector technology at frequencies of 40 and 90 ghz .",
    "it is eventually anticipated to measure the bb polarization power spectrum with an improvement in sensitivity over wmap by a factor of @xmath74 .",
    "the lowest frequency of 40 ghz , compared to 23 ghz for wmap , makes the faraday polarization power spectrum smaller by a factor of 7.3 for the same magnetic field ; such an experiment could thus place limits on the amplitude of a primordial field which are a factor of approximately @xmath75 more stringent than those here .",
    "a detailed analysis for this experiment @xcite projects limits on a homogeneous primordial field below @xmath76 g ; however , primordial field limits will always be stronger than the stochastic field considered here , because faraday rotation of a primordial field also generates nonzero tb and eb polarization cross - correlations which are larger than the corresponding bb power spectrum .",
    "polarized foreground emission is also a potentially difficult systematic limit to these measurements .",
    "other upcoming polarization experiments aimed at detecting the bb polarization from inflation are likely to improve on the faraday rotation limits here , though the faraday rotation power spectrum amplitude decreases by a factor of 230 between wmap s 23 ghz channel and a likely 90 ghz lowest - frequency bolometer channel .",
    "the cosmological magnetic field itself generates microwave background anisotropies , particularly via the tensor and vector perturbations it induces @xcite ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for overviews of magnetized cosmological perturbations ) .",
    "here we have neglected these perturbations , limiting ourself to considering the faraday rotation effect alone , which provides a distinctive signature of magnetic fields nearly independent of other properties of the universe .",
    "we use the direct observational data without any priors .",
    "our magnetic field limits are weaker than those arising from cmb temperature maps @xcite or current bounds on a homogeneous magnetic field due to correlations between different @xmath58 modes @xcite and cmb temperature non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "the strongest future limits on magnetic fields in the early universe will likely come from limits on the temperature and polarization fluctuations generated by magnetic field - induced vector perturbations @xcite ; we will address these current limits from wmap data elsewhere .",
