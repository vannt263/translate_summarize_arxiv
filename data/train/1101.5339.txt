    "interestingly , during the first major flare the gev flux shows ",
    "double - horn \" structure ; namely , a sharp rise by a factor of @xmath39 within 1 day followed by a gradual 3-day decrease , then a gradual 3-day rise followed by a rapid decrease by a factor of @xmath40 within 1 day .",

    " the one characterized by the asymmetric profile with the decay timescale longer than the rise timescale  a clock - wise evolution on the @xmath43 plane can be noted , while during the first flaring epoch ( composed of two sub - flares ) , a hint of ` harder  when  brighter ' behavior can be found .",
    "we performed a detailed spectral analysis for the accumulated dataset , investigating the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of 4c+21.35 within the lat energy range during each activity state of the source defined in figure1 and 2(a ) .",
    "the resulting spectra are shown in figure3 .",
    "as shown , the spectra are in general harder during the active states when compared to the quiescent state .",
    "the quiescent sed is well described by a single power - law function with photon index @xmath44 .",
    "this value is in agreement with that given in 1fgl for this object , and is also a typical value for the gev photon indices of fsrqs detected by the _ fermi _ lat @xcite . during the intermediate state , a single power - law model is significantly rejected compared to a broken power - law model ( the difference of the logarithm of the likelihood fits , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the maximum likelihood estimated for the null and alternative hypothesis , respectively @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath47 , which can be related to the @xmath48 distribution using wilks theorem ) , consistent with a presence of a spectral break around @xmath49gev .",
    "similarly , during the first flare a broken power - law model is favored over a simple power - law ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the same is true for the second flare , albeit at a lower significance level ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "table2 summarizes the broken power - law fits ( low- and high - energy photon indices @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively ) for the discussed epochs .",
    "it is important to investigate , however , if the curvature of the flaring gev spectrum in 4c+21.35 is indeed as sharp as implied by the broken power - law fit , or if it is instead much smoother , being better characterized by , e.g. , the log - parabola .",
    "the corresponding ` alternative ' log - parabola fits are therefore given in table3 .",
    "it can be seen that the log parabola is also preferred over the simple power law , though the values of @xmath54 are not as large as in table2 . to investigate whether the broken power law is a better fit to the data than the log parabola we use a @xmath48 criterion based on the fluxes in 12 energy bands",
    "( see figure 3 ) . by combining the whole data",
    "set accumulated during both the intermediate and active periods ( mjd 5508655371 ) , we found that the broken power - law model gives @xmath55 = @xmath56 , fully compatible with the data , while the log - parabola gives @xmath55 = @xmath57 , corresponding to a chance probability of @xmath58 ( equivalent to @xmath59 ) , and is hence disfavored by the data .",
    "we therefore conclude that the broken - power - law model is a better representation of the source spectrum during the active periods .",
    "the three different seds of 4c+21.35 corresponding to different periods of the active state of the source are compared in figure4 with the flaring spectrum of another famous fsrq detected by the _ fermi _",
    "lat , 3c454.3 (  the brightest flare spectrum  of 3c454.3 corresponding to the epoch mjd 5516655173 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "this comparison indicates a similar break energy located around @xmath0gev , but a variety of low- and high - energy spectral slopes .",
    "note , finally , that during the flares the @xmath5-ray continuum of 4c+21.35 extends up to gev photon energies with rather flat photon indices @xmath60 , and this is a quite unexpected behavior for fsrqs ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "with the assumed cosmology , the redshift of 4c+21.35 corresponds to a luminosity distance of @xmath61gpc . at this distance ,",
    "the @xmath5-ray spectrum of the source extending during the flares with flat photon indices @xmath60 up to the observed photon energies of @xmath62gev , where it reaches monochromatic energy fluxes of the order @xmath63erg@xmath64s@xmath10 , implies isotropic gev luminosity @xmath65 \\simeq 7 \\times 10^{47}$]ergs@xmath10 . anticipating a bolometric correction of the order of a few , the corresponding ( ` flaring ' ) @xmath5-ray luminosity of 4c+21.35 would therefore be @xmath66ergs@xmath10",
    ". the analogous value for the quiescent state should then be one to two orders of magnitude lower ( see figure3 ) .",
    "also , since the @xmath5-ray emission of fsrqs  generally thought to result from inverse - comptonization of ambient photon fields within relativistic jets at sub - pc / pc distances from the central engine ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )  is beamed in the observer rest frame , the total power emitted during the major flares is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the jet bulk lorentz factor @xcite .",
    "note that in the broad - band modeling of blazar sources detected by egret , @xcite claimed @xmath69 for 4c+21.35 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the emerging value of @xmath70 with the total power radiated by the central engine , i.e. , by the supermassive black hole / accretion disk system in this object .    for 4c+21.35 , @xcite give the energy flux of the h@xmath71 emission line @xmath72erg@xmath64s@xmath10 .",
    "this corresponds to an isotropic luminosity of @xmath73ergs@xmath10 , and hence to the total luminosity of the broad - line region ( blr ) of @xmath74ergs@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this value is in a good agreement with ( a factor of 2 lower than ) the corresponding one claimed by @xcite and @xcite for the source .",
    "the luminosity of the accretion disk illuminating and ionizing the blr clouds in 4c+21.35 can thus be evaluated as , roughly , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the fraction of the disk radiation reprocessed in the blr ( which is expected to be at the level of @xmath31 ) .",
    "this implies that , during the @xmath5-ray flares , the radiative output of the nuclear jet in 4c+21.35 is of the same order of magnitude as that of the central engine , @xmath77 . with the conservative estimates for radiative efficiencies of an agn jet and of a standard accretion disk , the energetics of 4c+21.35 therefore becomes extreme , as argued below .",
    "first , let us note that @xcite estimated the mass of the supermassive black hole in 4c+21.35 as @xmath78 .",
    "this gives the eddington luminosity of @xmath79ergs@xmath10 and the accretion - related luminosity in eddington units @xmath80 .",
    "the implied high accretion rate indicates the accretion disk in 4c+21.35 to be of the standard `` optically - thick , geometrically - thin '' structure , radiating with the efficiency of @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the total power of the accreting plasma .",
    "the analogous radiative efficiency of a nuclear agn jet , which could be defined as @xmath83 for the total jet kinetic power @xmath84 , is a poorly known parameter , though there are arguments in favor of @xmath85 at most , since agn jets in luminous sources are expected to transport ( and to deposit ) the bulk of their kinetic energies far away from their bases ( on kpc - mpc scales ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "hence , the efficiency of the jet production in the discussed object appears to be very high , namely @xmath86 indicating that , at least during the flares , the jet in the analyzed source carries away a total power comparable to the total accretion luminosity available to feed the outflow . as a result , the two major flares detected by _",
    "fermi_lat should be considered as being saturated at the maximum level .",
    "in other words , we should not expect to detect any flares from 4c+21.35 more luminous than @xmath87ph@xmath64s@xmath10 .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context that @xcite  who modeled the broad - band spectral energy distributions of several fsrqs detected by the _ fermi _",
    "lat in a quiescent state and compared the emerging model parameters with the analogous ones obtained during the flaring epochs of the same objects  concluded that `` the difference between the low- and high - activity states in luminous blazars is due to the different total kinetic power of the jet '' .",
    "this , along with our finding regarding the energetics of 4c+21.35 as presented above , could therefore suggest an interesting scenario for the nature of the variability in luminous blazar sources .",
    "namely , the two findings , when considered together , would be consistent with the situation in which during the quiescent states the total kinetic power of quasar jets constitutes only a small fraction of the accreting power ( @xmath88 ) , while during the major outbursts  triggered most likely by some sort of instabilities operating within the accretion disk  the jets carry away almost all of the available accretion - related luminosity ( @xmath89 ) . since for the quasar - hosted blazars the fraction of time in which a source is in a flaring state ( i.e. , when the observed flux is about one order of magnitude or more higher than the average flux of a source ) is about @xmath90 @xcite , such epochs characterized by the extremely efficient jet production are not representative of the whole kinetic output of the central engine , however .    even though 4c+21.35 may be considered as a peculiar blazar for a number of reasons ( comparable core and extended radio fluxes , or a relatively small @xmath91 , for example ) , we believe that the above finding / speculation should apply to most fsrqs .",
    "that is because in terms of the standard radio - loudness parameter , this object is quite representative for its class . in particular , for the @xmath92-band luminosity @xmath93ergs@xmath10@xmath94ergs@xmath10 following from the absolute magnitude @xmath95 as given in @xcite , and the @xmath96ghz radio luminosity @xmath97ergs@xmath10 as given in @xcite , one can find the radio - loudness parameter of 4c+21.35 source @xmath98 being typical for jetted quasars in general @xcite .",
    "as described in the previous section (  2 ) , the flaring spectra of 4c+21.35 exhibit clear breaks at observed photon energies @xmath0gev .",
    "such breaks , which seem characteristic for bright fsrqs in general , were studied most extensively in the case of the analogous blazar 3c454.3 .",
    "in particular , during the early _ fermi_lat observations of 3c454.3 , @xcite reported on the gev flare characterized by the rise and decay timescales of @xmath99days , which clearly displayed a broken power - law form of the emission continuum with the low- and high - energy photon indices @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively , and the break photon energy @xmath102gev .",
    "@xcite analyzed the subsequent major outburst of 3c454.3 , demonstrating that despite significant flux changes in @xmath5-rays ( involving multiple flares with different profiles and flux doubling timescales possibly as short as hours ) , the photon break energy remained stable .",
    "those findings are therefore compatible with the ones presented in our paper .",
    "@xcite argued that the break in the gev spectrum of 3c454.3 can not result from simple cooling effects , not only because the spectral change is larger than the one following from the simplest homogeneous emission models ( @xmath103 ; although see in this context * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also because the location of the break  similar for different flares and different activity levels of the source  is not consistent with the expected one ( around the observed mev photon energies ; see * ? ? ?",
    "the latter argument holds also for 4c+21.35 , even though in this case the relatively mild spectral change observed , @xmath104 ( see table2 ) , is seemingly suggestive of the standard cooling effects .",
    "@xcite showed also that the broken power - law form of the gev continuum in 3c454.3 can not result from the absorption of the emitted @xmath5-rays via photon - photon annihilation on the lower - frequency jet emission , or on the extragalactic background light , since in both cases the corresponding optical depths for @xmath0gev photons are significantly less than unity .",
    "finally , it was argued that the pair - production processes involving the direct x - ray emission of the accretion disk and disk corona can not play a role in this context as well , because the blazar emission zone would then have to be located too close to the black hole ( a few schwarzchild radii ) .",
    "again , the same is true for 4c+21.35 .",
    "for all those reasons , @xcite advocated for the observed break in the @xmath5-ray spectrum of 3c454.3 to reflect a break in the underlying energy distribution of the radiating electrons , which is `` intrinsic '' to the particle acceleration processes taking place within the emission region .",
    "more recently , @xcite proposed an alternative explanation for the origin of the break in the spectrum of 3c454.3 , discussing a particular model for the broad - band emission of the source . in the model ,",
    "a break around the observed gev photon energies is due to a transition from the dominant inverse - compton scattering ( in the thomson regime ) of the direct emission from the accretion disk , to the dominant inverse - compton scattering ( taking place in the klein - nishina regime ) of the disk emission re - processed in the blr .",
    "the change in the dominant seed photon population is crucial , since the transition between the thomson and the klein - nishina regimes in the inverse - compton scattering process involving a single target photon field can not result in a relatively sharp break in the emission spectrum ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , we note that in evaluating the @xmath5-ray output of the 3c454.3 jet , @xcite did not take into account any line emission of blr clouds ionized by the accretion disk , but considered only a disk continuum thomson - scattered by the blr clouds as a soft photon field for the inverse - compton radiation ; in reality , the line emission may dominate over the thomson - scattered continuum by at least one order of magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and this can possibly affect the model results .",
    "this line emission , on the other hand , was analyzed carefully by @xcite in their attempts to explain the gev breaks of bright _ fermi _ blazars . in particular",
    ", @xcite argued that the pair production on the heii lyman recombination continuum and line emission of blr clouds may be responsible for broken power - law @xmath5-ray spectra of fsrqs , with spectral breaks formed around photon energies of @xmath105gev . the model ,",
    "if correct , would imply the blazar emission zone ( at least in the case of quasar sources ) to be located `` inside the region of highest ionization of the blr '' , i.e. at @xmath106pc distances from the central engine .",
    "one should mention at this point that a possible challenge to the proposed scenario could be a lack of any observational signatures for the emission of secondary pairs created via the photon - photon annihilation in the spectra of fsrqs ( e.g. , in the x - ray domain ; see in this context the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this issue would have to be investigated in a more quantitative way in the particular context discussed here before drawing any definitive statements .",
    "in addition , in the model one should also expect the klein - nishina effects to modify the energy distribution of the highest - energy electrons cooling radiatively via inverse - compton upscattering of the uv photons from the blr , and thus producing the observable signatures in the synchrotron continua of luminous blazars @xcite . before now , no such signatures have been found @xcite , although the frequency regime of interest ( uv / soft x - ray ) is particularly challenging observationally . keeping the above caveats in mind , below we discuss in more detail whether the model by @xcite can be applied to 4c+21.35 .",
    "first , let us therefore estimate the luminosity of the heii lyman complex in 4c+21.35 . for a wide range of the values characterizing the ionization parameter and column density in the closest vicinities of black hole / accretion disk systems of quasar sources ,",
    "one expects @xmath107 to be of the order of @xmath31 of the ly@xmath108 emission @xcite .",
    "hence , for the ly@xmath108 luminosity of the blr in 4c+21.35 , namely @xmath109ergs@xmath10 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we get @xmath110ergs@xmath10 .",
    "second , the characteristic scale for the blr in the object , @xmath111 , should be evaluated .",
    "this can be done by applying the standard relation between the disk luminosity @xmath112 and @xmath111 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , to obtain @xmath113 ( see eqn.2 ) .",
    "hereafter we take the characteristic size for the high - ionization lines ( heii lyman complex ) to be half this value , namely @xmath114 @xcite , and fix @xmath115 .",
    "the opacity for the few - gev photons is then @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the photon - photon pair production cross section in the units of the thomson cross section , and @xmath118 for all the parameters as discussed above and the characteristic photon energy of the heii lyman emission @xmath119ev .",
    "even though implying formally @xmath120 for @xmath121gev @xmath5-ray photons is reached for @xmath122 @xcite . ]",
    ", this condition is exactly what is needed to produce a gev break observed in the spectrum of 4c+21.35 , because in the analyzed model one expects @xmath123 . in other words ,",
    "the fact that 4c+21.35 is characterized by a lower accretion disk luminosity than 3c454.3 is consistent  in the framework of the discussed model  with the fact that the spectral break in the former source is smaller than in the latter one ( @xmath104 versus @xmath124 ; note here that @xmath125 and @xmath126 , so that @xmath127 ) .",
    "we conclude that as long as the _",
    "fermi_lat observations of 4c+21.35 are considered _ solely _ , the model proposed by @xcite can nicely account for the break observed in the spectrum of this blazar .",
    "an additional observational constraint is provided by the detection of 4c+21.35 at @xmath1tev energies by the magic telescope @xcite , which coincided with the second gev flare of the source .",
    "this coincidence suggests co - spatiality of the gev and tev emitting regions . yet , if the gev break is indeed due to the pair production on the high - ionization lines emitted by the blr clouds , the emission zone has to be located at distances @xmath128 cm from the central engine . at such distances , on the other hand ,",
    "the photon - photon annihilation related to the near - infrared @xmath129@xmath130 m emission of the circumnuclear matter is likely to prevent the @xmath131tev photons from escaping the circumnuclear environment , as argued below .",
    "first , let us note that the multi - body emission continuum of the standard accretion disk , peaking around @xmath132hz frequencies , extrapolates down to near - infrared ( nir ) frequencies with the @xmath133@xmath130 m luminosity constituting at least @xmath31 of the total disk luminosity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this , together with @xmath112 estimated above , would then imply the nir luminosity of the accreting matter in 4c+21.35 of the order of @xmath134ergs@xmath10 , which is in good agreement with the value @xmath135ergs@xmath10 following from the @xmath136@xmath130 m flux @xmath137mjy provided by @xcite for the object .",
    "taking into account a possible contribution of the hot dust ( located at some further distance , see below ) and of the synchrotron jet emission to the observed nir flux , we consider @xmath138ergs@xmath10 to be a safe guess regarding the disk luminosity in 4c+21.35 indeed .",
    "yet this emission is produced in the innermost parts of the accretion flow , with the characteristic size much smaller than @xmath111 .",
    "this implies that the nir photons emitted directly by the disk illuminate the jet region located around @xmath111 exactly from behind , what reduces significantly the efficiency of the pair production process due to the very kinematics of the photon - photon interaction ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this efficiency is not going to be drastically reduced .",
    "therefore , a @xmath2tev emission zone in 4c+21.35 located at @xmath139 may be excluded . ] .",
    "hence , the opacity for the @xmath2tev radiation produced within the blr is dominated not by the direct nir emission of the accretion disk , but instead by the soft infrared photons emitted by the blr itself , and also by the circumnuclear dust distributed beyond the blr clouds .",
    "regarding the former component , we refer to the detailed calculations presented in @xcite and @xcite , which are based on the working assumption about a spherical distribution of blr clouds around the active center .",
    "these calculations show in particular that the corresponding optical depth for the @xmath140tev photons is of the order a few , assuming the standard value @xmath141 .",
    "this already suggests that the sub - tev emission of 4c+21.35 ( as well as the gev emission of the source , if co - spatial ) , is not likely to be produced inside the region of the highest ionization of blr , but instead at @xmath142 .",
    "even more problematic may be however the latter component , which is related to the circumnuclear hot dust region ( hdr ) forming a torus - like structure around the accreting black hole .",
    "the characteristic scale of this structure , @xmath143 , can be estimated by applying the established relation between the disk luminosity @xmath112 and @xmath143 ( hereafter we assume the hot dust temperature @xmath144k ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "for the particular parameters of 4c+21.35 one obtains in this way , roughly , @xmath145 the corresponding optical depth for the tev photons produced within @xmath146 is then @xmath147 where @xmath148ev , and @xmath149 is the fraction of the disk radiation reprocessed in the inner regions of the dusty torus , expected again to be at the level of @xmath31 .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath150 is confusingly high .",
    "it may suggest that  _ if _ the @xmath5-ray continuum of 4c+21.35 in the source rest frame extends up to @xmath151tev energies , while at the same time the emission zone is located at distances @xmath146  the @xmath149 parameter is significantly lower than expected ( and , in fact , than inferred for the other analogous sources ) .",
    "alternatively , the distribution of the hot dust around the nucleus of the discussed object may be very different from the simple geometry anticipated here ( and in the literature ) . nevertheless , even if both effects are relevant , the basic estimates presented above imply that one really should expect non - negligible , or even significant pair - production signatures around tev photon energies in the intrinsic spectrum of 4c+21.35 .",
    "lack of such signatures would therefore place the blazar emission zone in the discussed object at relatively large distances from the active center , @xmath152 , as recently advocated by @xcite for luminous blazars in general . on the other hand",
    ", the fact that the magic spectrum of 4c+21.35 extends up to @xmath153tev energies only , may be providing a crucial piece of evidence in this context , since the emission of the hot dust is expected to fall sharply at wavelengths @xmath154@xmath130 m , thus decreasing the optical depth for @xmath155tev photons .",
    "in this paper we report on the two - year - long _ fermi_lat observation of the peculiar blazar 4c+21.35 ( pks 1222 + 216 ) .",
    "this source was in a quiescent state from at least august 2008 until september 2009 , and then entered a period of enhanced activity consisting of a gradual flux increase with some moderate flares superimposed .",
    "in april and june 2010 , 4c+21.35 underwent a very strong gev outburst composed of several major flares characterized by the rise and decay timescales of the order of a day , and by the daily @xmath5-ray fluxes nearly comparable to that of the vela pulsar , the brightest persistent source in the @xmath5-ray sky . during the outburst",
    ", the gev spectra of 4c+21.35 displayed a broken power - law form with spectral breaks located near @xmath0gev photon energies , similar to the flaring spectra of another luminous blazar , 3c454.3 .",
    "we demonstrate that , at least during the major flares , the jet in 4c+21.35 carries a total power comparable to the total accretion luminosity available to feed the outflow . as a result , the two major flares detected by the _",
    "lat should be considered as being saturated at the maximum level , and we should not expect to detect any flares from 4c+21.35 more luminous than @xmath87ph@xmath64s@xmath10 .",
    "we also discuss the origin of the break observed in the flaring spectra of 4c+21.35 .",
    "we show that , in principle , the model involving annihilation of the gev photons on the heii lyman recombination continuum and line emission of blr clouds ( as proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may account for such breaks .",
    "however , we also discuss the additional constraint provided by the surprising detection of 4c+21.35 at @xmath140tev energies by the magic telescope , which coincided with the second gev flare of the source .",
    "we argue that this sub - tev emission ( as well as the gev emission of the source , if co - spatial ) , is not likely to be produced inside the region of highest ionization of blr ( @xmath3 cm ) , because of the expected large opacity for @xmath5-rays related to photon - photon annihilation on the infrared photon field provided by the accretion disk , blr , and nuclear dust .",
    "instead , it seems to originate further away from the active center , most likely as far as the characteristic scale of the hot dusty torus surrounding the 4c+21.35 nucleus ( @xmath4 cm ) .    after completing this work",
    ", we learned that our basic estimates regarding the tev opacity are supported by the most recent analysis of the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "data by @xcite ( 2011 ) , who found a prominent infrared excess in the observed spectrum of 4c+21.35 , and showed that the excess is well modeled by the @xmath156k dust emission .",
    "the extremely high isotropic luminosity of the hot dust estimated by @xcite indicates that the fraction of the disk radiation reprocessed in the inner regions of the dusty torus in 4c+21.35 is as large as @xmath157 . the exact spectral shape and the luminosity of the infrared continuum of the source available in a near future , as well as of the detail of the tev spectrum soon reported by the magic collaboration ( aleksic et al . , 2011 , to be submitted",
    ") , will allow us to re - examine the conclusions and estimates presented in our paper .",
