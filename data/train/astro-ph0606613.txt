    "there is now compelling evidence that electron - positron ( @xmath0 ) pairs form and flow away in the vicinity of many compact astronomical objects ( radio pulsars , accretion disk coronae of galactic x - ray binaries , soft @xmath3-ray repeaters , active galactic nuclei , cosmological @xmath3-ray bursters , etc . ) .",
    "the estimated luminosity in @xmath0 pairs varies greatly depending on the object and the specific conditions : from @xmath4 ergs  s@xmath2 for radio pulsars up to @xmath5 ergs  s@xmath2 in cosmological @xmath3-ray bursters .    for a wind out - flowing spherically from a surface of radius @xmath6",
    "there is a maximum ( isotropic , unbeamed ) pair luminosity beyond which the pairs annihilate significantly before they escape .",
    "this is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the pair bulk lorentz factor , and @xmath9 the thomson cross section .",
    "when the injected pair luminosity , @xmath10 , greatly exceeds this value the emerging pair luminosity , @xmath11 , can not significantly exceed @xmath12 ; in this case photons strongly dominate in the emerging emission : @xmath13 . injected pair luminosities typical of cosmological @xmath3-ray bursts ( e.g. , piran 2000 ) , @xmath14 ergs  s@xmath2 , greatly exceed @xmath15 .",
    "for such a powerful wind the pair density near the source is very high , and the out - flowing pairs and photons are nearly in thermal equilibrium almost up to the wind photosphere ( paczyski 1990 ) .",
    "the outflow process of such a wind may be described fairly well by relativistic hydrodynamics ( e.g. , grimsrud & wasserman 1998 ; iwamoto & takahara 2002 ) .",
    "in contrast if @xmath16 annihilation of the outflowing pairs is negligible . it is now commonly accepted that the magnetospheres of radio pulsars contain such a very rarefied ultra - relativistic ( @xmath17 ) pair plasma that is practically collisionless ( e.g. , melrose 1995 ) .",
    "recently we developed a numerical code for solving the relativistic kinetic boltzmann equations for pairs and photons . using this we considered a spherically out - flowing , non - relativistic ( @xmath18 ) pair winds with the total luminosity in the range @xmath19 ergs  s@xmath2 , that is @xmath20 ( aksenov et al .",

    "although the pair plasma ejected from the strange - star surface contains no radiation , as the plasma moves outwards photons are produced by pair annihilation and bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "figure  2 shows the mean optical depth for photons , from @xmath58 to @xmath74 . the contribution from @xmath74 to",
    "infinity is negligible for @xmath75 cm , so @xmath76 is practically the mean optical depth from @xmath58 to infinity for these values of @xmath58 .",

    "this simply reflects the fact that in this case the pair annihilation time @xmath93 is less than the escape time @xmath94 , so most injected pairs annihilate before they escape .",
    "the value of @xmath95 is about two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath96 [ see equation ( 1 ) ] that is estimated from consideration of the same processes , but without taking into account gravity of the star .",
    "however , with gravity at low luminosities ( @xmath97 ergs  s@xmath2 ) pairs emitted by the stellar surface are mainly captured by the gravitational field , and a pair atmosphere forms .",
    "the probability of pair annihilation increases because of the increase of the pair number density in the atmosphere , and this results in decrease of the fraction of pairs in the emerging emission in comparison with the case when gravity of the star is neglected .    the number rate of emerging pairs @xmath98 as functions of @xmath10 is shown in figure  4 .",
    "for @xmath99 ergs  s@xmath2 the value of @xmath100 is @xmath101 times smaller than the same calculated by aksenov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) where gravity is neglected .",
    "this is due to partial suppression of pair creation as the photon energies are reduced by gravitational redshift .",
    "we can see that there is an upper limit to the rate of emerging pairs @xmath102",

    "figure  5 presents the energy spectra of the emerging photons for different values of @xmath10 . at low luminosities , @xmath103 ergs  s@xmath2 , photons that form in annihilation of @xmath0 pairs",
    "escape from the vicinity of the strange star more or less freely , and the photon spectra resembles a very wide annihilation line with the mean energy of @xmath104  kev ( see fig .",
    "the small decrease in mean photon energy @xmath105 from @xmath106 kev at @xmath107 ergs  s@xmath2 to @xmath108 kev at @xmath109 ergs  s@xmath2 occurs because of the energy transfer from annihilation photons to @xmath0 pairs via compton scattering ( aksenov et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) . as a result of this transfer",
    ", the emerging @xmath0 pairs are heated up to the mean energy @xmath110 kev at @xmath111 ergs  s@xmath2 . for @xmath112 ergs",
    "s@xmath2 , changes in the particle number due to three body processes are essential , and their role in thermalization of the outflowing plasma increases with the increase of @xmath10 .",
    "we see in figure 5 that , for @xmath113 ergs  s@xmath2 , the photon spectrum is near blackbody , except for the presence of a high - energy tail at @xmath114 kev . at this luminosity ,",
    "the mean energy of the emerging photons is @xmath115 kev , while the mean energy of the blackbody photons is @xmath116 kev .      .",
    "for comparison , we show as the dotted line the mean energy of blackbody photons for the same energy density as that of the photons at the photosphere . also shown as",
    "the dashed line is the mean energies of the emerging photons in the case when only two particle processes are taken into account.,scaledwidth=52.0% ]    since strange quark matter at the surface of a bare strange star is bound via strong interaction rather than gravity , such a star is not subject to the eddington limit and can radiate in photons and pairs at the luminosity of @xmath117 ergs  s@xmath2 or even higher ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "another important idiosyncrasy that we find is hard spectra and a strong anti - correlation between spectral hardness and luminosity . while at very high luminosities ( @xmath118 ergs  s@xmath2 ) the spectral temperature increases with luminosity as in blackbody radiation , in the range of luminosities we studied , where thermal equilibrium is not achieved , the expected correlation is opposite ( see fig .",
    "these differ qualitatively from the photon emission from neutron stars and provides a definite observational signature for bare strange stars .",
