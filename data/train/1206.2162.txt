    "avoided level crossings play an important role in quantum mechanics .",
    "they are known for about 80 years @xcite . in the case",
    "that the hamilton operator of the system is hermitian and the real eigenvalues @xmath3 provide the energies of the discrete states of the system , two of its states never will cross .",
    "instead they avoid crossing when controlled by a parameter .",
    "this phenomenon is an observable effect : it consists in an exchange of the two states , including their populations , in a many - particle system .",
    "the exchange takes place at the critical value @xmath0 of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding crossing points of the energy trajectories can be found by analytical continuation into the continuum @xcite .",
    "narrow resonance states show a similar behavior .",
    "they are described well by the complex eigenvalues @xmath4 and biorthogonal eigenfunctions @xmath5 of a non - hermitian hamilton operator @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues provide not only the energies @xmath3 but also the widths @xmath6 ( inverse lifetimes ) of the states . mostly , the resonance states avoid crossing similar to discrete states . however , in contrast to the eigenvalue trajectories of discrete states , the eigenvalue trajectories of resonance states can cross .",
    "the crossing points are called usually _ exceptional points _ according to kato @xcite who studied first the nontrivial mathematical properties of these singular points .",
    "also in the case of avoided crossings of resonance states , the corresponding crossing points can be found by varying one additional parameter .",
    "recent studies have shown qualitatively that dynamical phase transitions in open quantum systems occur when the level density is high and , correspondingly , many neighbored states avoid crossing in a relatively small parameter range @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the system is ( dynamically ) stabilized : the number of states is reduced ( by one when the environment consists of one continuum ) , the individual spectroscopic properties of the original states are lost , and the narrow ( trapped ) resonance states of the system show collective features . meanwhile ,",
    "unexpected experimental results from different fields of physics could be explained qualitatively by means of this phenomenon ( see @xcite where some of them are sketched ) .",
    "the dynamical stabilization of the system is environmentally induced and appears _ only _ in open quantum systems which are described by a non - hermitian hamilton operator due to the embedding of the system into the environment of scattering wavefunctions .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to study in detail generic features of open quantum systems at high level density where more than two states avoid crossing and the ratio of the widths of the states to the energy differences between them is larger than 1 .",
    "a realistic case of such a type is considered first in nuclear physics @xcite , then in laser induced continuum structures in atoms @xcite , and later in many other systems , see the review @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "we restrict the study to four overlapping resonance states and three different avoided level crossings . in difference to the paper @xcite on the signatures of symmetric hamiltonians with three coalescing eigenfunctions , we are interested in the behavior of the _ eigenvalues _ of a symmetric non - hermitian operator in the regime of overlapping resonances where the states _ avoid crossing_. here , the wavefunctions of the two states are mixed in a finite parameter range around the critical value @xmath0 of the avoided crossing .",
    "the mixing range shrinks to one point when analytically continued up to the exceptional point by means of another parameter @xcite . at the exceptional point ,",
    "the two eigenfunctions become linearly dependent from one another @xcite .",
    "our calculations are performed with real , complex as well as with imaginary coupling coefficients of the states via the environment .",
    "the mixing of the wavefunctions caused by this coupling is simulated , according to the numerical results obtained in @xcite , by assuming a gaussian distribution around the critical point of avoided crossing at the critical parameter value @xmath0 . at high level density , the gaussian distributions related to avoided crossings of different levels may overlap .",
    "our results show that , in the regime of overlapping gaussian distributions , new effects arise from the imaginary part of the coupling term via the environment which are related to width bifurcation .",
    "they are much more pronounced than the effects caused by the real part of the coupling term which leads to level repulsion in energy .",
    "furthermore , symmetries between the states are shown to play an important role in the avoided level crossing phenomenon .",
    "this result hints at the relation of avoided level crossings to exceptional points .",
    "in section [ form ] , the formalism used for the calculations , is formulated .",
    "some results for two crossing levels are given in section [ two ] while those for four crossing levels can be found in section [ four ] .",
    "the results are summarized and conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "we consider an @xmath7 matrix @xmath8 the diagonal elements of which are the @xmath9 complex eigenvalues @xmath10 of a non - hermitian operator .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the energies and widths , respectively , of the @xmath9 states without account of the interaction of the different states via an environment .",
    "this interaction is contained in the values @xmath13 which stand for the coupling matrix elements @xmath14 of the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 via the environment , where @xmath17 is the wavefunction of the state @xmath15 .",
    "the corrections due to the coupling @xmath18 of the state @xmath15 to the environment ( i.e. to the continuum of scattering wavefunctions into which the system is embedded ) lead to the selfenergy of the state @xmath15 , see @xcite . in atomic physics ,",

    "the two states cross when @xmath42 .",
    "the results for the @xmath32 case @xcite show further that the wavefunctions of the two states @xmath43 and @xmath44 are mixed in a finite range of the parameter @xmath1 around the critical value @xmath0 at which the two states avoid crossing .",
    "this holds true not only for resonance states but also for discrete states .",
    "furthermore , a nonlinear source term appears in the schrdinger equation in the neighborhood of an exceptional point and the critical point of an avoided crossing , respectively .",
    "this source term causes irreversible processes @xcite .    in our calculations ,",
    "the mixing coefficients @xmath26 ( see equation ( [ int2 ] ) ) of the wavefunctions of the two states due to their avoided crossing are not calculated .",
    "we simulate the fact that the two wavefunctions are mixed in a finite parameter range around the critical value of their avoid crossing @xcite by assuming a gaussian distribution @xmath45 for the coupling coefficients .",

    "<S> the mixing of the two wavefunctions around @xmath0 is simulated , in each case , by assuming a gaussian distribution around @xmath0 . at high level density , the gaussian distributions related to avoided crossings of different levels may overlap . here , </S>",
    "<S> new effects arise , especially from the imaginary part of the coupling term via the environment . </S>",
    "<S> the results show , moreover , the influence of symmetries onto the multi - level avoided crossing phenomenon . </S>"
