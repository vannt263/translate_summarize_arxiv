    "the dynamics of a polymer in a viscous solvent in equilibrium is well understood @xcite . starting from the exactly solvable rouse model @xcite , which neglects",
    "excluded volume and hydrodynamic interactions , it was found that the centre of mass of the polymer diffuses with a diffusion constant @xmath0 that is inversely proportional to the number of monomers @xmath1 .",
    "the time for the polymer to diffuse over its own radius of gyration @xmath2 then introduces a typical time scale , called _ rouse timescale _ , @xmath3 , which scales with @xmath1 as @xmath4 .",
    "individual monomers subdiffuse for times smaller then @xmath3 , but follow the diffusion of the centre of mass after @xmath3 @xcite . going beyond the rouse model , the effects of excluded volume and hydrodynamic interactions can be incorporated using scaling theories @xcite , simulations and exactly solvable models @xcite .",
    "much less is known about the dynamics of a polymer in the crowded @xcite and nonequilibrium cellular environment .",
    "the crowdedness introduces viscoelastic behaviour @xcite with a long term memory while the action of molecular motors and other atp - driven , active , processes puts the cell out of equilibrium .",
    "recently , several experimental and theoretical studies have investigated the role of active processes on biopolymer dynamics . on a coarse grained scale ,",
    "activity can be seen as an extra source of randomness in addition to that due to thermal motion .",
    "this is reflected in a random motion of tracer particles ( and small biopolymers like proteins ) that is much enhanced in comparison with thermal brownian motion @xcite . in other experiments , the internal dynamics of a polymer was found to be influenced by the presence of active forces .",
    "we mention the effect on the bending dynamics of microtubuli @xcite .",
    "more relevant for the present paper are studies in which it was found that the motion of chromosomal loci in simple organisms like bacteria and yeast are sensitive to active forces @xcite . for example ,",
    "weber and collaborators @xcite found that after addition of chemicals that inhibit atp - synthesis , the diffusion constant of chromosomal loci decreased by 49@xmath5 .",
    "also measurements of chromatin dynamics in eukaryotes show evidence for an important role played by atp - dependent processes @xcite .    in the theoretical description of the motion of chromosomal loci",
    ", it came as somewhat of a surprise that again the simple rouse model turned out to be relevant @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was recently argued to give a good description of this motion , both between @xcite and during chromosomal segregation @xcite .",
    "the reason for this may be the action of topoisomerases and related enzymes which cross chromosome strands and thus make the bacterial chromosome a phantom chain @xcite .",
    "however , other models have been introduced to describe the motion of bacterial chromosomes , for example , in terms of self - adhesion of monomers @xcite .",
    "none of these models did however explicitly investigate the effects of active forces .    in the present paper , we extend recent work on the rouse chain in a _",
    "medium @xcite by including active forces .",
    "the advantage of our model is that it is exactly solvable and hence like the original rouse model can be used as a benchmark for studies of more realistic models that include physical effects like self - avoidance , bending rigidity and so on .",
    "some of our results ( superdiffusion , polymer swelling ) have indeed been recently seen in simulations @xcite of such models . however , all the numerical work known to us is for the _ viscous _ regime .",
    "our work is the first to include both effects of viscoelasticity and active forces , two ingredients that are necessary for a proper modelling of a cellular environment .",
    "the rouse model @xcite is the starting point in all discussions of polymer dynamics .",
    "it models a long polymer chain as a set of @xmath1 beads ( monomers ) connected by harmonic springs .",
    "it is important to point out that such a description of a real polymer is only appropriate at a coarse grained level , i.e. at length scales above the persistence length .",
    "hence , our model will only be relevant for long biopolymers ( like chromosomes ) and also other physical properties , like crowdedness , viscoelasticity and active forces , will be described at this coarse grained level .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the position of the @xmath7-th monomer ( @xmath8 ) at time @xmath9 .",
    "let us discuss the various forces acting on this monomer ( for a schematic representation of our model , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "move in a fixed direction ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    in the rouse model , the monomers are connected by springs with spring constant @xmath10 . in equilibrium , the average squared distance @xmath11 between two monomers then follows from the equipartition theorem and equals @xmath12 where @xmath13 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath14 temperature .",
    "a rouse chain gives a description of a semiflexible polymer on length scales where @xmath15 corresponds to the kuhn length @xcite .",
    "we will apply our model to the bacterial chromosome , for which the kuhn length is of the order of @xmath16 nm or @xmath17 base pairs ( bp ) @xcite . since the chromosome of _",
    "e. coli _ has approximately @xmath18 bp , the relevant value of @xmath1 is of the order @xmath19 .",
    "the cellular environment is a crowded material @xcite in which tracer particles ( nano particles , mrna , ... ) were found to subdiffusive ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) . while originally the precise explanation of this behaviour was unclear , and various mechanisms where proposed , recent experimental evidence shows that viscoelasticity and its mathematical description based on a generalized fractional langevin equation best describes the observed behaviour @xcite .",
    "the friction force @xmath20 on a monomer in a viscoelastic medium has memory and is commonly described in terms of a power law kernel @xmath21 @xmath22 viscous behaviour is recovered for @xmath23 ( for which @xmath24 ) while for @xmath25 we get elastic behaviour . for @xmath26 , we have the viscoelastic situation , intermediate between elastic and viscous response .",
    "estimates of @xmath27 range from @xmath28 for _ e. coli _",
    "@xcite to @xmath29 in the cytoplasm @xcite of eukaryotes .",
    "an expression for the friction like eq",
    ".   breaks down on short timescales of the order of the molecular collision time scale . in bacterial cells , an upper limit to memory effects",
    "is put by the cellular lifetime .",
    "the random thermal force @xmath30 acting on the @xmath7-th monomer is given by a gaussian random variable , with average zero and a correlation that is coupled to the kernel @xmath31 by the ( second ) fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite @xmath32 with the choice of the power law kernel , @xmath30 becomes fractional gaussian noise @xcite .",
    "much less is known about the precise form of the active forces @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , the precise characterisation of their statistical properties in living cells is a topic of current research @xcite .",
    "ultimately , the activity is due to active particles ( molecular motors , or other active proteins ) that consume energy to generate motion and associated dissipation . in a simple model ( see @xcite for a review ) , self - propelled particles ( spps ) move with constant velocity in a direction @xmath34 that is subject to rotational brownian dynamics .",
    "this leads to a typical motion in which the autocorrelation of @xmath34 decays exponentially .",
    "in @xcite , the dynamics of a polymer in the presence of such spps is studied .",
    "the polymer and spps interact through a truncated lennard - jones potential . on a more coarse grained level",
    ", this type of interaction leads to a random force on the monomers .",
    "the force has an exponential correlation with a timescale @xmath35 , which can be interpreted as the typical time during which the spps move in a straight line .    the modelling of active processes through this type of random forcing is quite common in the literature and was for example used in @xcite in simulations of active semiflexible polymers .",
    "we will follow this approach since our model , as already stressed above , is defined on a coarse grained scale . in conclusion",
    "then , we assume that the active force on the @xmath7-th monomer , @xmath33 , is a gaussian random variable with average zero and a correlation given by @xmath36 here @xmath37 characterises the strength of the active noise",
    ". we do not include possible spatial correlations in order to keep the model soluble .",
    "moreover , little experimental insight on such correlations is available .",
    "putting everything together and neglecting inertial terms , the equation of motion of the @xmath7-th monomer is the overdamped generalized langevin equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the heaviside function .",
    "it is important to point out that the active forces , since they are not related to the friction kernel , put the system out of equilibrium . starting in equilibrium at @xmath40 , the solution to equation ( [ 0 ] ) therefore gives the response of the polymer to , for example , the addition of atp at @xmath40 . after a long time",
    ", the polymer will evolve to a new , nonequilibrium steady state . in the next section",
    "we will calculate both the transient and steady state behaviour of the polymer after activation of the active forces .",
    "the techniques to solve the set of equations ( [ 0 ] ) with appropriate boundary conditions are standard @xcite .",
    "the details are given in the supplemental material to this paper @xcite .",
    "here , we discuss only the results .",
    "in the dynamics of the polymer two relevant time scales occur .",
    "the first is @xmath35 , the second is the rouse time @xmath3 , which in the viscoelastic medium equals @xmath41^{1/\\alpha}$ ] @xcite .",
    "notice that for the bacterial chromosome , using the values of @xmath42 and @xmath27 quoted above , @xmath3 can become quite large , indeed larger than the duration of the cell cycle .",
    "the persistence time of active processes should be much smaller then the cellular lifetime , so that when applying our model to the bacterial chromosome , the two timescales are separated , @xmath43 .",
    "experiments on chromosomal loci are done on timescales of @xmath44 seconds to minutes , i.e. in the regime @xmath45 .",
    "we first discuss the motion of the centre of mass @xmath46 .",
    "it was found earlier that in a viscoelastic medium but in absence of active forces @xcite , the centre of mass @xmath46 performs a subdiffusion @xmath47 where @xmath48 . to this subdiffusion an extra term",
    "is added when the active forces are turned on .",
    "it equals @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a difference of two incomplete gamma - functions .",
    "firstly , observe that as in the standard rouse chain , the ( generalized ) diffusion constant remains inversely proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "more interestingly , it can be shown that for @xmath51 , ( [ 5 ] ) goes as @xmath52 , i.e. is superdiffusive if @xmath53 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath54 , ( [ 5 ] ) evolves as @xmath55 , i.e. slower than ( [ 4 ] ) , so that asymptotically in time , @xmath56 .",
    "the resulting behaviour is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath57 and various values of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "as the figure shows ( boxed region ) , if @xmath58 is large compared to @xmath59 , over several orders of magnitude in time , the centre of mass subdiffuses with an exponent @xmath60 , whereas without active forces , the exponent would be @xmath27 . if this time regime corresponds to the experimental one , not taking into account active forces could lead to a wrong estimate of the exponent @xmath27 ,     ( color online ) log - log plot of squared distance travelled by the centre of mass as a function of @xmath61 for a rouse chain in a viscoelastic medium ( @xmath62 ) in the presence of active forces with @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( full lines , top to bottom ) compared to that without active forces ( dashed line ) .",
    "the inset shows the same for the viscous case , @xmath23 .",
    "results are for @xmath65 . ,",
    "width=340 ]    and hence to a wrong characterisation of the rheological properties of the environment .",
    "results like that of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are under the assumption that our model is realistic for all @xmath9 . when comparing with experimental data , one has to take into account that , as already discussed in the previous section , the model will break down on small and large time scales .",
    "therefore in the cellular context , it is possible that only the superdiffusive behaviour is observed .    for the viscous case , @xmath66 , so that after an initial regime of ballistic motion @xmath67 , the polymer performs ordinary diffusion but with a diffusion constant that is enhanced by a factor @xmath68 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "a second global quantity is the end - to - end vector @xmath69 .",
    "its averaged squared length , @xmath70 , measures the size squared of the polymer and equals in equilibrium , both in viscous and viscoelastic media , @xmath71 . in response to active forces",
    ", @xmath72 gets an additional term which equals    @xmath73    here @xmath74 is the generalized mittag - leffler function @xcite , and @xmath75 . since ( [ 7 ] ) is positive , we conclude that active forces swell the polymer .",
    "it can be easily shown that initially this swelling grows proportional to @xmath52 after which @xmath72 saturates . in fig .",

    ", active bath is calculated and compared with experiments .",
    "using the results of that paper , and the fact that the rouse chain consists of @xmath1 independent harmonic oscillators one can also derive ( [ 8 ] ) .    in the viscoelastic case , the situation is more complicated .",
    "it is possible to determine the leading behaviour of the integrals in ( [ 7 ] ) for @xmath80 ( and @xmath81 ) . in this way it is found that for @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the hurwitz zeta function . in fig .",

    "the inset shows that the results for a smaller time window in absence and presence of active forces ( @xmath99 ) run parallel.,width=340 ]    analysing the resulting behaviour , we find that as was the case for the centre of mass , the short time response of the monomers to active forces is superdiffusive ( at least when @xmath100 ) .",
    "this behaviour , where @xmath101 , holds for @xmath102 . very recently superdiffusive",
    "motion of chromosomal loci has indeed been observed @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether these _ rapid chromosomal movements _ are due to active processes or to stress relaxation .",
    "our results however quantify better the response to active forces and could therefore help in discriminating the real origin of the observed motion .",
    "for @xmath103 the monomers follow the @xmath104 subdiffusion of the centre of mass .",
    "the behaviour in the intermediate time regime , @xmath105 , is more complicated and contains terms proportional to @xmath106 ( coming form ( [ 10 ] ) ) , @xmath55 ( from the centre of mass ) , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "no simple power law behaviour emerges . a plot of the full expression for @xmath109 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) for @xmath37 large shows that the initial superdiffusion is followed by a @xmath107 behaviour , after which there is a large time window in which the @xmath55 term dominates .",
    "the crossover time to the @xmath104-regime is very large , and may not be observable for chromosomal loci . for certain values of @xmath37 and @xmath35 , there is a time regime ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) where , on a log - log scale , the graphs of @xmath109 in presence and absence of active forces run parallel .",
    "this scenario resembles , at least qualitatively , the experimental one , where after inhibition of atp synthesis with sodium azide and 2-deoxyglucose , the exponent of the loci s subdiffusion hardly changed but the diffusion coefficient decreased @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied the behaviour of a long ideal polymer chain in a viscoelastic and active bath .",
    "we have formulated and solved a nonequilibrium version of the rouse model , a model that in equilibrium forms the starting point of the theory of polymer dynamics .",
    "the results obtained are interesting for nonequilibrium statistical mechanics ( power law response to active forces , equipartition theorem out of equilibrium ) and polymer physics ( swelling of polymer in an active bath ) .",
    "moreover , our results show a qualitative similarity with experimental results on bacterial chromosomes .",
    "we mention the regime with superdiffusive motion of monomers and the fact that in certain time frames the exponent of the subdiffusive motion is almost independent of the presence / absence of active forces .",
    "while the rouse model has been claimed to describe well several properties of bacterial chromosomes @xcite , it is clear that such a description can not be valid for all time and length scales and that effects of self - avoidance , bending rigidity , topology and so on have to be taken into account .",
    "this is even more true for chromatin for which modified rouse models have been introduced that take into account bending rigidity @xcite or long range interactions @xcite .",
    "the motion of chromosomal loci was also investigated on the basis of scaling arguments and computer simulations @xcite in the fractal globule model , which shares topological properties with chromatin @xcite . to investigate these issues",
    "further , we have recently developed an algorithm that allows to simulate particles and polymers in a viscoelastic medium subject to correlated noises coming both from thermal forces and active forces . with that algorithm it becomes possible to include effects of self - avoidance and bending rigidity and to see how the behaviour found here for an ideal chain",
    "is modified .",

    "<S> the motion of the centre of mass and of individual monomers is calculated . on time scales that are comparable to the persistence time of the active forces </S>",
    "<S> , monomers can move superdiffusively while on larger time scales subdiffusive behaviour occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between this subdiffusion and that in absence of active forces is quantified . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the polymer swells in response to active processes and determine how this swelling depends on the viscoelastic properties of the environment . </S>",
    "<S> our results are compared to recent experiments on the motion of chromosomal loci in bacteria . </S>"
