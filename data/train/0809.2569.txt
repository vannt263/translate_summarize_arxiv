    "for magnetic schrodinger operators in half - plane , hatsugai established a fundamental result @xcite that says that the number of conducting channels forming in the gap of the bulk system due to the presence of an edge is equal to total chern number of the bands below that gap .",
    "the work by hatsugai applies only for rational magnetic fluxes and homogeneous edges with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "almost 10 years later , using an advance mathematical machinery , kellendonk , richter and schulz - baldes established @xcite a new link between the bulk and edge theory , which ultimately allowed them to generalize hatsugai s statement to half - plane magnetic schrodinger operators with weak random potentials , irrational magnetic fluxes and general boundary conditions ( the result was first announced in ref .",
    "the result was later extended to continuous magnetic schrodinger operators in ref .",
    "these breakthrough results are especially important since they directly relate the quantization of the edge currents to a new topological invariant , the index of a specific fredholm operator . using this new invariant",
    ", one can directly explore the topology of the edge states under quite general ( and physically relevant ) boundary conditions , without the need of any gedanken experiments that employ artificial boundary conditions .    under similar assumptions ,",
    "the equality between bulk and edge hall conductance was also demonstrated by elbau and graf , soon after the publication of ref .",
    "@xcite , this time using more traditional methods . in ref .",
    "@xcite , which treats continuous magnetic schrodinger operators , the edge appears at the separation between a left and a right potential , potentials that can assume quite general forms , in particular , they can include strong disorder .",
    "a similar result was established for discrete schrodinger operators in ref .",
    "we should mentioned that certain regularization of the edge conductance was necessary for the case of strong disorder .",
    "it is also important to notice that these papers @xcite give a direct relation between the edge and bulk conductance and they do not discuss and edge index .",
    "however , in many situations , the edge index introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is quite useful @xcite and this is precisely what we will discuss in this paper .",
    "the works we mentioned above studied the integer hall effect for simple magnetic shcrodinger operators in half - plane . in 1988 , haldane introduced a new model that exhibits the integer quantum hall effect even thought the net magnetic flux per primitive cell is zero @xcite .",
    "this strange property is typically present in tight - binding models with more than one quantum state per site and with broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "it is a consequence of the non - trivial chern number associated to the occupied bands of the model .",
    "this work lead to the discovery of a new class of insulators that now bear the name chern insulators .",
    "it was argued in the literature @xcite that , due to their non - trivial topological properties , finite samples of chern insulators must posses edge conducting channels that wind around the sample similar to what happens in the magnetic case .",
    "thus , chern insulators will display remarkable edge physics , without the need of a macroscopic magnetic field .",
    "we should mention that no crystals of chern insulators were discovered so far .",
    "it was argued , however , that by patterning ferroelectric materials one could fabricate a photonic crystal @xcite with similar properties .",
    "theoretically , chern insulators are as ubiquitous as the normal insulator .",
    "generally , thight - binding hamiltonians with more than one quantum state per site and with broken time reversal symmetry can be always tuned to exhibit bands with non - zero chern number .",
    "one of the simplest example of a chern insulator is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 labels the sites of a planar lattice generated by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4=0 and im@xmath5$]@xmath60 .",
    "this model is unitarily equivalent to the original haldane s model and , in the bulk , it exhibits two bands with chern numbers equal to @xmath7 .",
    "the edge structure of the model was studied in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and the numerical calculations show one edge channel forming along the edge of the sample , in accordance to what one will predict from the topology of the bulk bands ( in these calculations one rather sees two channels since the calculations were performed for slabs rather than half - plane samples ) .",
    "the calculations were , of course , performed for homogeneous edges .",
    "our main question here is what happens to the edge channels for a rough boundary .",
    "the question is interesting since the edge channels are localized near the boundary and the rough boundary can be seen as a strong random potential acting on these quasi - onedimensional states .    while the question is interesting in itself , by solving it we want to demonstrate an application of the abstract machinery given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we developed an axiomatic framework for current quantization . in the process",
    ", we identified the minimal conditions in which such quantization takes place .",
    "we claim that this minimal conditions bring significant simplifications over the previous works and the main goal of the present paper is to show how standard it is to demonstrate that these minimal conditions are met in chern insulators . for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors rely heavily on the gaussian decay of the heat kernel for bulk magnetic schrodinger operators and the estimates throughout the paper are quite involved . here",
    "we will show that just simple exponential decay estimates on the bulk resolvent will do the job .",
    "moreover , we will demonstrate that , once these exponential decay estimates are established , the minimal conditions stated in ref .",
    "@xcite can be derived by following several standard , model independent steps .",
    "thus , the present application completes the abstract formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite by showing that the required minimal conditions can be demonstrated via a somewhat universal technique .",
    "we hope that the present simplifications will make the technique more accessible to the theoretical physicists and that the generality of the proofs will encourages a search for new systems where the technique could lead to non - trivial insight .",

    "as we shall see , these three properties assure that the minimal conditions stated in ref .",

    "as the estimates of the next sections will show , we can continuously switch on the missing hopping terms in @xmath11 until it becomes identical to @xmath131 and keep @xmath145 in the fredholm class during the process .",
    "due to the invariance of the index under norm - continuous deformations , we can conclude @xmath146 using successive deformations of the type describe above , we can always deform a contour into another and the conclusion is that the index is independent of @xmath9 .",

    "this is a very simple but important result because the edge bands can be easily computed numerically for the homogenous case . moreover , if necessary , one can further simplify the computation of the index by considering continuous deformations of the bulk hamiltonian that keep the insulating gap opened . using the fundamental result of kellendonk , richter and schulz - baldes @xcite , we now know that the number computed in eq .",
