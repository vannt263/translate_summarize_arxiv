    "we are interested in the behavior of quantum particles , that is , wave packets propagating through interacting environment . in general , there are two types of environment .",
    "one is the ordinary medium ( plasma , dielectric , etc . ) which consists of `` matter '' [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "the other is the nontrivial structure of the vacuum due to field theoretical fluctuations @xcite or effects of quantum gravity @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the presence of such environments will modify the dispersion relation of particles , @xmath3 , or modify the shape of the wave packet .",
    "observation of the arrival time of particles through such environments is a way to see the effects of these modifications .",
    "recently , these effects have been tested in two fields , astrophysics and quantum optics .",
    "the first is the observation of arrival times of photons from distant astrophysical sources such as @xmath4-ray bursters .",
    "several models of quantum gravity suggest that the velocity of light has an effective energy dependence due to the modified dispersion relation induced by the nontrivial structure of space - time at distances comparable to the planck length . to confirm this effect ,",
    "it is necessary to observe a certain difference of the arrival time of photons with different energies , and @xmath4-ray bursters work for this purpose @xcite . as a result , a lower bound on the energy scale of quantum gravity",
    "is obtained @xcite .",
    "the second recent test is observation of tunneling of photons .",
    "chiao and co - workers constructed an elaborate stadium for the race between photons propagating in the vacuum and through an optical barrier , and measured their arrival times @xcite .",
    "they found that the photon tunneling through the barrier arrived at the goal earlier than the other photon traveling in the vacuum .",
    "although this result implies superluminal velocity of the tunneling photon , it does not mean causality violation , because in this case the group velocity itself does not transport any information at all .",
    "the apparent superluminality results from reshaping of wave packets while tunneling .",
    "similar phenomena can be found in absorbing media @xcite .",
    "anyway , in both experiments , measurement of the arrival time of wave packets plays an essential role",
    ".    however , there is no clear definition of arrival time in quantum mechanics .",
    "this has its root in the well - known fact that time is not an operator but a parameter in quantum mechanics .",
    "though many authors have attempted to define an operator of arrival time and construct its eigenstates , a satisfactory formulation has not yet been obtained [ 10 - 25 ] . in this article",
    "we define a distribution function @xmath0 , which describes the arrival time of packets at a detector located at point @xmath2 . in terms of @xmath0",
    ", we can compute a mean arrival time @xmath5 .",
    "of course we assume an ideal detector and our definition of @xmath0 might not exactly correspond to the physical measurement process .",
    "however , concrete calculation of @xmath0 shows us clearly the dynamical properties of propagation of packets through interacting environments .",
    "we investigate the arrival time distribution @xmath0 numerically for nonrelativistic massive particles traveling through a potential barrier in one space dimension , that is , tunneling processes .",
    "this might be a simple model for the experiment of chiao and co - workers . in this case",
    "the existence of a potential barrier @xmath6 causes reflection and transmission of packets ; therefore the behavior of @xmath0 will be highly nontrivial , depending on various parameters . how to deal with time in tunneling processes",
    "is also known as the tunneling time problem .",
    "the problem arises from the paradox that a particle under a potential greater than the particle s energy seems to move with a purely imaginary velocity . in recent developments of nanotechnology ,",
    "the study of the tunneling time has great significance because it might enable us to estimate the response time of nanodevices @xcite .",
    "various approaches to the tunneling time have been proposed by many authors [ 27 - 36 ] ; however , it seems difficult to define it uniquely .",
    "therefore we need to define effective tunneling times for each system and each purpose .",
    "we have no intention of wrestling with the general theory of tunneling time now ; therefore , we restrict ourselves to analyzing the time of appearance of the packet in the exit of the potential barrier and how it moves after that . these two notions determining the arrival time difference",
    "have usually been confused . in this article",
    "we will distinguish them clearly .",
    "finally we consider the real - time stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics introduced by nelson @xcite .",
    "since it utilizes the real - time trajectories of quantum particles as sample paths , we can construct an appropriate time distribution from ensemble of sample paths .",
    "this is why nelson s approach is expected to be effective for time problems in quantum mechanics . in particular , it is interesting to attack the tunneling time problem from this approach because we can trace the particle s real - time motion even under the tunneling potential",
    ". actually it has been found that the tunneling particle `` hesitates '' in front of the barrier @xcite .",
    "this property seems paradoxical because it implies that the particle tunneling through the barrier should always be delayed compared with the free one due to this hesitation and it seems contradictory to the advancement of the peak of the wave packet as seen in the experiment of chiao and co - workers .",
    "is it a real paradox ?",
    "it is clear that nelson s approach can reproduce any physical quantities of the usual quantum mechanics by averaging them about the sample path ensemble .",
    "however , there is no reason that any `` observables '' classically defined in nelson s stochastic procedures should have corresponding quantities in the standard quantum mechanics .",
    "we will compute the arrival time distribution in nelson s approach and compare it with our @xmath0 .",
    "then we clarify the real physical meaning of the `` hesitation '' and show that there is no paradox at all .",
    "furthermore , we mention that nelson s interpretation can explain the characteristic behavior of @xmath5 for tunneling particles very well .",
    "first we will briefly review previous attempts to define a time of arrival operator and their difficulties . in the 1960s ,",
    "aharonov and bohm quantized the representation of the classical arrival time for the free particle at a point @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the initial position and momentum , respectively , where we work in the heisenberg picture . because @xmath11 satisfies @xmath12=i\\hbar$ ] , it seems a good definition .",

    "that is , @xmath11 is not hermitian .",
    "the origin of difficulty is the singular behavior of @xmath11 at @xmath15 .",
    "recently the regularization of @xmath11 with an infrared momentum cut off @xcite and an interpretation by means of the positive - operator - valued measure were proposed @xcite .",
    "however , the validity of this procedure is not clear @xcite . in the first place",
    ", there is no one - to - one correspondence between the operator representation in quantum theory and the classical representation , and it becomes more complicated for interacting cases [ 19 - 22 ] .",
    "now we will not insist on defining an arrival time operator ; rather , we try to construct an arrival time distribution directly .",
    "we suppose that there is a detector on the path along the motion of wave packets and it counts the particle according to the value of the wave function @xmath16 at every time @xmath17 . supposing the detector is ideal , we directly define _ the arrival time distribution _ @xmath0 from @xmath18 , @xmath19    although eq .",
    "( [ ( 4 ) ] ) looks like a trivial definition in our picture , we will derive it , clarifying our system setup and assumptions .",
    "we consider a system consisting of a particle and a detector located at @xmath20 .",
    "if there is no interaction between them , the system hamiltonian @xmath21 and the system state @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the particle hamiltonian , @xmath25 is the particle state , and similarly @xmath26 and @xmath27 are those of the detector .",
    "we define the total hamiltonian @xmath28 by adding the interaction hamiltonian @xmath29 between the particle and the detector , @xmath30 for simplicity , we consider a detector whose state consists essentially of two components , @xmath31 corresponding to this representation , we set the interaction potentials @xmath32 which induces a transition @xmath33 .",
    "this choice of @xmath34 should be meaningful only in the first order of @xmath35 .",
    "now we consider the time evolution of the system from @xmath36 to @xmath1 .",

    "we now assume that the detector reacts only once incoherently , and therefore we calculate only in the first order of @xmath35 . adopting the interaction picture ,",

    "now we apply a macroscopic decoherence condition , @xmath52 this means that the states reacted at different times are orthogonal to each other , that is , once the detection process occurs , the total state effectively loses its coherence and looks like a mixed state .",

    "( [ ( a8 ) ] ) .",
    "we should describe the detector by means of an infinite - dimensional hilbert space to realize decoherence effectively @xcite .",

    "the evaluation of @xmath38 and @xmath54 is straightforward as follows : @xmath55 @xmath56 where at the last step we inserted the complete set ( @xmath57 ) three times .",

    "our @xmath54 is often called the `` presence time distribution '' because of its behavior in the classical limit @xcite . in order to avoid confusion ,",
    "we should make clear that the distribution @xmath54 may not be interpreted as the probability distribution of a quantum mechanical time observable .",
    "it is an effective distribution describing a `` relative probability . ''",

    "therefore we can not identify @xmath64 as a probability distribution . as for detection beyond the potential barrier as we discuss below , @xmath61 might effectively maintain positivity and actually the behavior of @xmath64 is found to be similar to ours .",

    "we have to work with the probability of existence of paths at a point ( or a section ) at some definite time .",

    "[ fig : drift10 ] ) . in the foreground of the barrier",
    ", according to the interference of the incident packet and the reflected packet , @xmath117 oscillates frequently and becomes null many times .",
    "especially near the barrier entrance @xmath148 , @xmath117 changes from positive to negative , where the particle is `` trapped . ''",
    "these effects cause the path s hesitation .    at earlier times",
    ", @xmath117 is almost always positive value but at later times , it becomes almost always negative . in fig .",
    "[ fig : drift10 ] , this tendency is extreme and realization of the tunneling path is much rarer than in fig .",
    "[ fig : drift05 ] .",
    "this is the reason why the early arrived paths tend to pass the barrier more easily .",
    "after all , there is no inconsistency between our results and the hesitation behavior in nelson s interpretation .",
    "furthermore , nelson s interpretation provides us an intuitive explanation of our results .",
    "let us consider the high potential barrier case .",
    "it is important that every transmitted path hesitates to some extent . in the small @xmath74 region , because of the high transmission rate , even a path arriving at @xmath151 relatively late can pass the barrier , and as a result we find @xmath139 . as @xmath74 increases , the transmission rate becomes lower and only the paths arriving at @xmath151 earlier can penetrate the barrier , and as a result we find @xmath140 .",
    "finally , as @xmath74 becomes very large , the paths arriving at @xmath151 very early hesitate there for a very long time ; therefore @xmath102 becomes positive again .",
    "of course , we must recall that the `` path '' in nelson s view never corresponds to a real particle in ordinary quantum mechanics , and the explanation we gave above is just an interpretation .",
    "the same is true for an interpretation by the bohm trajectory @xcite .",
    "it may be interesting to regard the path as a physical one and to calculate various quantities that can not be calculated in ordinary quantum mechanics ( the tunneling time @xmath152 , quantities calculated in the first time counting scheme , etc . ) .",
    "although these attempts may give us deeper insights into quantum dynamics , the validity and significance of them have not been argued much so far @xcite .",
    "supposing an ideal detector , we defined simple expressions for the arrival time distribution @xmath153 and the mean arrival time @xmath154 , and applied them to analysis of wave packet tunneling .",
    "we defined @xmath155 and calculated it for various barrier conditions and showed the barrier effects clearly . in the small @xmath74 region",
    ", @xmath102 is always positive , but as @xmath74 increases , @xmath156 for the over - the - barrier case and @xmath157 for the tunneling case .",
    "after tunneling , the packet usually moves faster than the free one because it preferentially consists of the higher momentum modes of the incident packet .",
    "the barrier works as an acceleration filter in a sense .",
    "we also clarified that the stationary phase method gives a good approximation to our results , particularly in the small @xmath74 region .",
    "we also confirmed that the stochastic interpretation introduced by nelson reproduces our results .",
    "furthermore , we clarified how the `` hesitation '' of the tunneling paths in nelson s picture is consistent with the advancement of the tunneling packet .",
    "the key observation is that the paths arriving at the barrier earlier than the free mean paths tend to penetrate the barrier more easily .",
    "we pointed out that this property can be explained by the time dependence of the drift velocity @xmath117 and found that the behavior of @xmath102 is intuitively understandable with nelson s language .",
