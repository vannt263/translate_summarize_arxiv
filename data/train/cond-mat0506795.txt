    "at a continuous transition only a few static exponents are enough to completely describe equilibrium critical behaviour . when dynamic measurements are considered the critical behaviour becomes much richer , with further independent critical quantities having non - trivial critical exponents .",
    "it has been generally assumed that in a given dimension all ising spin glasses ( isgs ) lie in a single universality class .",
    "the hamiltonian of the isgs is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the usual ising spins and the nearest - neighbour couplings @xmath5 are random variables .",
    "we have studied numerically critical dynamic behaviour for isgs having near neighbour interactions in dimensions @xmath6 and @xmath7 with bimodal , gaussian , or laplacian distributions of the couplings .",
    "@xcite we find that the dynamic exponents vary strongly and systematically from one distribution to another .",
    "one possible explanation for this could be that for isgs the universality class depends on the form of the interaction distribution . in section ii we introduce the dynamical quantities , whereas in section iii we treat the important point of the reliable determination of critical temperatures .",
    "we then present our results for the spin glasses in four ( section iv ) and three ( section v ) space dimensions .",
    "finally , section vi contains our conclusions .",
    "in the field of dynamic critical measurements there is not complete consensus as to a universal convention for indicating protocols or exponents , particularly for the case of spin glasses .",
    "we will first define the convention that we will use , following @xcite , and relate it to other standard conventions .",
    "we will then summarize dynamic scaling properties .",
    "this section leans heavily on the review @xcite .    throughout",
    ", we will implicitly consider only model a dynamics @xcite with single spin glauber ( or heat bath ) updates in ising spin glasses ; the total time after quench is refered to as @xmath8 .",
    "the basic dynamic protocol ( there are potentially many others ) consists in quenching the sample at time @xmath9 from @xmath10 to a temperature @xmath11 , waiting ( carrying out updates ) for a time that will be called @xmath12 ; then at @xmath13 and still at fixed @xmath11 , either the physical conditions are changed in some way ( typically by switching on or switching off a small magnetic field @xmath14 ) or the instantaneous spin configuration at time @xmath12 is simply registered to provide a reference state , without physical conditions being changed .",
    "there is then an observation period of further updates during which physical parameters are measured as functions of @xmath8 . for convenience the time difference @xmath15",
    "is also denoted @xmath16 . in alternative conventions the waiting time @xmath12 is labeled @xmath17 , and @xmath16 is labeled @xmath8 .    among limiting",
    "conditions that can be profitably studied for large samples are the condition @xmath18 ( i.e. measurements start immediately on quenching ) , or alternatively @xmath19 , a long waiting time condition after which the sample is in `` quasi - equilibrium '' .",
    "true equilibrium can be achieved if @xmath12 is `` long enough '' , a criterion that depends in a non - trivial way on the system , on the temperature @xmath11 and on the sample size @xmath20 .",
    "many dynamic observables can be measured . here",
    "we will concentrate on observations at criticality , @xmath21 , for the moment ignoring the question of how @xmath22 is to be estimated .",
    "a first fundamental definition is that of the dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 . at @xmath22 , the equilibrium autocorrelation relaxation time ( with standard single",
    "spin updates ) increases with sample size @xmath20 as @xmath23 where @xmath0 is the dynamical critical exponent .",

    "the two - time linear autoresponse function is @xmath43 \\mid_{h=0 } ~~ ( t > s ) \\label{eq : rdef}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a time dependent conjugate magnetic field .",
    "the scaling equation for @xmath45 is @xmath46 with @xmath47 for critical systems .",
    "the critical scaling function @xmath48 should follow the asymptotic behaviour @xmath49 when @xmath50 .",
    "for short range inital correlations @xmath51",
    ".    in simulations where the field @xmath14 is applied at @xmath9 and switched off at @xmath13 , the following integrated response is measured at times @xmath52 : @xmath53 this integrated response is directly related to the commonly studied thermoremanent magnetization : @xmath54 of further interest is the fluctuation - dissipation ratio @xmath55 defined by @xmath56 in the quasi - equilibrium condition @xmath19 the fluctuation - dissipation theorem holds and @xmath57.@xcite when @xmath50 , @xmath55 takes a limiting value @xmath2 . for @xmath58",
    "the ratio @xmath59 also converges to this limit value .",
    "if the amplitudes @xmath60 and @xmath61 are defined in the same limit @xmath58 by @xmath62 and @xmath63 then @xcite @xmath64 finally , the dynamic spin glass susceptibility is measured through @xmath65   % \\chi_{ne}(t ) = [ \\langle s_{i}^{\\alpha}(t)s_{i}^{\\beta}(t ) \\rangle^{2 } ] \\label{eq : chi}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are two replicas of the same system relaxing independently .",
    "the infinite time limit to the dynamic sg susceptibility is the equilibrium sg susceptibility for each size @xmath20 , which at criticality increases with @xmath20 as @xmath68 where @xmath37 is the static critical exponent .",
    "the critical time dependence of the non - equilibrium spin - glass susceptibility for large samples after a quench to @xmath22 and with no anneal ( @xmath18 ) is @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath8 is the time after quench and @xmath0 is again the dynamical critical exponent . for convenience",
    "we have introduced an exponent @xmath70 .    even for a canonical continuous transition such as that of the @xmath71 ising ferromagnet , where the static critical exponents are all known analytically and",
    "are rational numbers , the dynamic critical exponents can only be established numerically and have non - trivial values.@xcite for ising ferromagnets however , field theory ( ft ) epsilon expansion estimates give reasonable agreement with numerical dynamic exponent estimates in dimensions @xmath72 and @xmath73.@xcite    it is now well established that for standard systems that are in the same universality class not only the static exponents @xmath74 etc .",
    "but also the dynamic exponents @xmath0 , @xmath75 and @xmath2 are all universal . the numerical data discussed in the following show that in each dimension for isgs expected to lie in the same universality class the dynamic exponents vary strongly with the form of the interaction distribution .",
    "in order to obtain accurate and reliable simulation values for the dynamic exponents an _ a priori _ requisite is to have reliable estimates for the ordering temperatures @xmath76 .",
    "high temperature series calculations give @xmath76 estimates which are not subject to finite size corrections and are thus intrinsically reliable , but whose accuracy is limited by the number of known terms in the series .",
    "series estimates can be extremely precise at high dimension but unfortunately they become progressively more inaccurate as the system dimension drops.@xcite    there are a number of different ways in which to obtain estimates of ordering temperatures in isgs through simulations ; for most of them one or more critical exponent estimates are also obtained simultaneously .",
    "equilibrium simulations can provide accurate data but necessarily on samples which are of small or moderate size @xmath20 , and the reliability and precision of the @xmath76 estimates are finally limited by the need to extrapolate to large @xmath20 to eliminate corrections to finite size scaling whose importance depends on the system being studied , on the parameter being measured , and on the maximum range of sample sizes that can be equilibrated with the computing facilities available .",
    "corrections to scaling are subtle even for the canonical ising ferromagnets @xcite where the leading corrections include both `` irrelevant operator '' and `` analytic '' contributions , while for isgs basic guide - lines are lacking so that one must rely on empirical observations . in principle",
    "it should be possible to use the onset of deviations from strict critical behaviour to monitor @xmath76 ; for instance @xmath77 against @xmath78 curves bend downwards / upwards for @xmath11 greater / less than @xmath76 . in the sg context",
    "this approach has been rarely used as the upbending below @xmath76 is weak , at least in 3d .",
    "the equilibrium finite size scaling simulation techniques , which are most often relied on to estimate @xmath76 in isgs , are based on measurements of parameters that are dimensionless and take on an @xmath20-independent value at @xmath76 for large @xmath20 .",
    "well known examples are the binder moment ratio @xcite @xmath79 and the second moment correlation length ratio @xcite @xmath80 . plots of @xmath79 or @xmath80 as functions of @xmath11 for fixed @xmath20 have a unique `` crossing point '' at a temperature which is equal to @xmath76 in the limit of large @xmath20 .",
    "these methods require strict thermal equilibration at each size @xmath20 ; also the exact position of the large @xmath20 limit crossing point may be masked up to quite large @xmath20 by corrections to scaling ( see for instance @xcite for the case of the canonical ising ferromagnet in three dimensions ) .",
    "simulations become heavier with increasing @xmath81 simply because for given @xmath20 the number of spins is @xmath82 , but this effect is compensated by the fact that @xmath0 tends to drop with increasing @xmath81 . furthermore crossing points",
    "become better defined at higher @xmath81 , and it turns out that corrections to finite size scaling become weaker as @xmath81 increases . on balance",
    "it is in fact easier to estimate @xmath76 reliably by equilibrium simulations at @xmath83 ( and above ) than at @xmath84 .",
    "an alternative simulation technique which we will rely on below is to combine static and dynamic measurements to estimate @xmath76 by consistency.@xcite this has the advantage of using two dynamic measurements which do not require equilibration and which have negligible corrections to scaling , together with equilibrium spin glass susceptibility measurements which do require equilibration but which are less sensitive to corrections to scaling than are binder moment ratio or correlation length ratio measurements . a range of putative @xmath76 values @xmath85 are chosen , and three measurements are made at each @xmath85 :    - the effective dynamic exponent @xmath86 from large @xmath20 quasi - equilibrium measurements with @xmath19 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : qeq ] ) ,    - the effective dynamic exponent @xmath87 from large @xmath20 measurements of the dynamic sg susceptibility eq .",
    "( [ eq : chine ] ) , and    - the effective static exponent @xmath88 from equilibrium sg susceptibility finite size scaling measurements , eq .",
    "( [ eq : chieq ] ) .",
    "as these three parameters are linked at @xmath76 through the two exponents @xmath37 and @xmath0 , eq .  ( [ eq : bscal ] ) , eq .  ( [ eq : chieq ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : chine ] ) , there is a consistency condition which holds at and only at @xmath89 .",
    "there are different ways to implement this condition .",
    "we can first use the equilibrium and dynamic sg susceptibility results together to obtain a set of values of @xmath90 at each @xmath85 .",
    "@xcite these values are to good precision independent of corrections to scaling , and the set of @xmath90 extends from above to below @xmath76 . secondly ,",
    "from the effective @xmath88 and @xmath86 one can derive a second effective @xmath91 , @xmath92 . at @xmath93 the consistency condition is simply @xmath94 .",
    "the measured values of the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath90 at this unique temperature correspond to the true critical exponents @xmath37 and @xmath0 .",
    "this method is rather insensitive to corrections to finite size scaling .",
    "the three isg distributions which will be considered here are the random bimodal , gaussian , and laplacian near neighbour interaction distributions on ( hyper)cubic lattices .",
    "the explicit normalized distributions are @xmath95/2 , \\label{binomial}\\ ] ] @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively .",
    "the distributions are symmetric about zero and are normalized in such a way that @xmath98 .",
    "we will first consider explicitly dimension 4 .",
    "@xmath76 values for a range of interaction distributions including the three cases that concern us here were obtained by simulations using the consistency method.@xcite for the bimodal and gaussian distributions the values were fully consistent with and were as accurate or more accurate than other simulation estimates using alternative simulation techniques.@xcite no other result appears to have been reported for the laplacian distribution .",
    "essentially negligible corrections to scaling can be seen in the data for any of the simulation techniques at this dimension ; for instance , the binder parameter crossing points are well defined and appear to be independent of @xmath20 to within high numerical precision .",
    "high temperature series estimates for the bimodal case @xcite and for other interaction distributions @xcite are in excellent agreement with the simulation estimates ; an overview of the data is given in @xcite .",
    "the overall agreement between the complementary approaches means that in @xmath83 the consistency simulation technique @xcite is validated .",
    "hence the @xmath76 values , together with the associated @xmath37 and @xmath0 critical exponent values from the consistency method , can be taken as reliable .",
    "non - equilibrium measurements of the two - time autocorrelation function and the two - time linear autoresponse function were made at the temperatures corresponding to the @xmath76 values estimated from the consistency method .",
    "large systems containing @xmath99 spins were simulated using the standard heat - bath algorithm .",
    "the systems were prepared initially in a completely disordered state and then quenched down to @xmath76 at time @xmath9 .",
    "for the computation of the thermoremanent magnetization an external field with strength @xmath100 was applied between @xmath9 and @xmath13 with @xmath12 varying from 25 to 400 .",
    "= 3.1 in    = 3.1 in    figure [ fig1]a and figure [ fig2 ] summarize our findings for the four - dimensional systems .",
    "the expected dynamical scaling behaviour ( [ eq : ccrit ] ) of the autocorrelation function is illustrated in figure [ fig1]a for the case of a laplacian distribution of the couplings .",
    "plotting @xmath101 as a function of @xmath102 for various values of the waiting time @xmath12 , an excellent data collapse is achieved for the value @xmath103 .",
    "deviations from this scaling behaviour are only obvious in the regime @xmath104 , i.e.  outside of the dynamical scaling regime . a similar good data collapse @xcite is obtained for the other distributions , see table [ table:1 ] and ref .",
    "it is worth noting that the values of @xmath35 obtained in these non - equilibrium simulations agree with those derived from the quantities @xmath37 and @xmath105 via eq .",
    "( [ eq : bscal ] ) . equilibrium and non - equilibrium simulations therefore consistently yield for isgs critical quantities depending on the form of the distribution of the couplings .    in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we discuss truly non - equilibrium quantities which can not be expressed solely by equilibrium quantities .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig2]a plotting @xmath106 versus @xmath107 results in straight lines in the long time limit , in agreement with the expected power - law behaviour ( [ eq : cassy3 ] ) .",
    "the slopes of these lines yield the exponent @xmath108 .",
    "again , this quantity , supposed to be universal , shows a clear dependence on the chosen distribution , see table [ table:1 ] . finally , figure [ fig2]b displays the temporal evolution of the fluctuation - dissipation ratio ( [ eq : xdef ] ) which in the limit @xmath109 yields the limit value @xmath110 , again supposed to be universal .",
    "it is obvious from this plot that the value of @xmath110 is different for the three distributions considered in this work .",
    "values for the various parameters corresponding to the present three distributions are shown in table [ table:1 ] .",
    "the amplitude ratio @xmath111 has been derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : xinf ] ) .",
    ".[table:1 ] parameter estimates in dimension 4 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     once again the estimates of the various static and dynamic critical exponents vary considerably from distribution to distribution .",
    "the sense of the variations is systematic and is the same as in dimension @xmath7 : with increasing kurtosis of the distribution , @xmath76 drops , @xmath0 increases , @xmath37 becomes more negative , and the dynamic exponents either expressed as @xmath1 and @xmath110 or as @xmath41 and @xmath112 all drop .",
    "for standard continuous transitions the renormalization group theory provides a comprehensive explanation of critical behaviour and in particular of the strict identity of exponents of all systems within each universality class , the class being defined by a restricted list of parameters which includes the physical dimension @xmath81 and the number of order parameter components @xmath113 .",
    "the universality covers not only equilibrium exponents but extends to the whole family of dynamic exponents .",
    "this universality reflects the fundamental principle that within each class , the details of the physics at the local level do not affect the large scale behaviour which determines the critical exponents .",
    "it has been widely assumed that in a given dimension all isgs fall in the same universality class .",
    "however it should be noted that the critical behaviour of spin glasses is qualitatively very different from that of standard systems such as ferromagnets .",
    "the upper critical dimension is 6 rather than 4 , and below the upper critical dimension the specific heat exponents are strongly negative so there is no specific heat peak or cusp .",
    "field theory ( which provides the well known @xmath114 expansion development at standard continuous transitions ) has proved intractable in the isg context below the upper critical dimension @xmath115 .",
    "@xcite already at @xmath116 and @xmath83 , numerical values of the equilibrium exponents obtained from summing the known leading terms to order three in the isg @xmath114 expansion @xcite are very different from estimates using the high temperature series method @xcite or simulations . for the ising ferromagnet at @xmath84 and",
    "so @xmath117 , the ft development in @xmath114 to third order is accurate to better than @xmath118.@xcite this is in total contrast to the situation for the bimodal isg where at @xmath116 ( so again at @xmath119 ) the ft sum to third order in @xmath114 gives @xmath120 , strikingly different from the high temperature series value @xcite @xmath121 and the simulation estimate @xmath122.@xcite this implies that a sum including many further terms ( oscillating in sign ) would be needed to finally obtain stable and accurate ft predictions .",
    "in practice , establishing such a sum seems entirely ruled out , but the question remains open as to whether the necessary quasi - cancellations among the unknown higher order ft terms could depend on parameters such as the lattice structure or the form of the interactions .    in our simulations of the ising spin glasses we have found that , in most cases , the differences between the exponent estimates for the different systems are much larger than the statistical error bars .",
    "this is especially obvious for the amplitude ratio @xmath111 which is supposed to yield clearly distinct values for different universality classes , similar to what is observed for static ampltude ratios at equilibrium .",
    "extrapolations in each dimension suggest that if the interaction distribution is modified and @xmath76 decreases , all the exponents studied vary systematically in such a way that @xmath0 increases strongly , @xmath37 tends towards a value near @xmath123 ( which is the strict limiting value for @xmath37 in each dimension when @xmath124 ) while @xmath110 and @xmath41 tend to near zero .",
    "the data as they stand are thus compatible with exponents each varying continuously towards a @xmath125 limit as @xmath76 is driven lower by a widening of the interaction distribution ( increasing kurtosis ) .    our non - equilibrium simulations can in principle be subjected to only three different sources of systematic errors : ( 1 ) the values of the critical temperatures are erroneous , ( 2 ) the sizes of the samples are too small , or ( 3 ) the time range of our runs is insufficient .",
    "let us address these three different points .",
    "the values of the critical temperatures we use have been estimated with a technique combining equilibrium and non - equilibrium measurements@xcite and are in excellent agreement with independent simulation estimates .",
    "in addition , @xmath76 in the four - dimensional systems have been confirmed recently@xcite by high temperature series estimates .",
    "this agreement validates the technique used for the evaluation of @xmath76 and also , as the method relies on a consistency argument , indirectly the values of @xmath105 and @xmath37 obtained in the same simulations .",
    "the data we have discussed in this paper concern principally dynamic exponents in isgs .",
    "these measurements have the advantage of not requiring strict equilibration , which in turn permits studies on samples so large that they can not be conveniently equilibrated at or near criticality .",
    "as the sample sizes @xmath20 are much larger than the maximum of the correlation length @xmath126 attained during the simulations , the measurements are always taken in the infinite sample size limit and are not hampered by finite - size effects .",
    "we have thus been able to minimize one of the major sources of systematic errors in numerical simulations , namely corrections to finite size scaling .",
    "this is very similar to what is observed when studying critical ferromagnets , as for example the three - dimensional ising model @xcite , where no notable finite - size corrections to scaling are encountered in non - equilibrium simulations , in contrast to equilibrium simulations where these corrections to scaling can be very strong .",
    "whereas finite - size effects are well controlled in non - equilibrium simulations of large systems , this is not immediately obvious for finite - time corrections .",
    "indeed , for spin glasses the critical dynamical exponent @xmath105 takes on very large values , whch might raise some doubts whether the simple power - law increase ( [ xi1 ] ) of the dynamical correlation length is valid in the time range we accessed .",
    "however , various investigations of spin glasses in different dimensions and with different distributions of the couplings in the recent past have found that in general the increase of @xmath126 is completely described by ( [ xi1 ] ) for times @xmath127 .",
    "we can therefore be confident that the dynamical scaling approach , underlying our estimates of the critical quantities , is also valid for spin glasses and that the values of the equilibrium and non - equilibrium critical quantities we obtain are reliable .",
    "furthermore , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] , the run times of our simulations are clearly sufficient for the dynamic parameters to take up their limiting values .    having now excluded the most probable sources of systematic errors we interpret our numerical data as strong evidence that in spin glasses critical quantities do depend on the exact form of the distribution of the couplings . of course",
    ", as we only provide numerical evidence , we can not completely exclude that corrections coming from other sources could have some impact on the values of the critical exponents .",
