    "chaotic systems have simultaneously a stochastic @xcite and a deterministic dynamical characters @xcite .",
    "single trajectories are predictable ( deterministic ) for a short - term evolution and unpredictable for a long - term evolution ( stochastic ) . while the stochastic character is associated with an exponential decay of correlations and information about the actual state is rapidly lost as the trajectory evolves , the deterministic character is associated to a power - law decay of correlations and information about the actual state is lost as the system is evolved , but in a rather slower fashion .    a relevant question that arises",
    "when dealing with data coming from complex systems is whether manifestations of chaotic behavior can be detected in the data @xcite so that one can construct deterministic models .",
    "one wishes to come up with a dynamical description of the data , but due to the sensitivity dependence on initial conditions of chaotic systems one is prompt to adopt a probabilistic approach in order to reveal the underlying dynamics of the system from statistical averages @xcite . a promising tool of analysis is provided by the statistics of the poincar recurrence time ( prt ) @xcite which measures the time interval between two consecutive visits of a trajectory to a finite size region in phase space .",
    "many relevant quantifiers of low - dimensional chaotic systems can be obtained by the statistical properties of the prts .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to apply some results from ref .",
    "@xcite and to propose other theoretical approaches to easily identify deterministic and stochastic manifestations in dissipative strongly chaotic systems by using the prts of chaotic trajectories to regions of finite size @xcite , considering only short return times .",
    "these later two conditions constraining our analyzes are devoted to suitably apply our approaches to realistic physical situations : the resolution to measure returns as well as the time frame to realize the experiment is finite .    by chaotic systems , we mean non - uniformly hyperbolic systems .",
    "we focus the analyzes on the hnon map and on an experiment , the chua s circuit , but we also present results coming from the logistic map .",
    "we first present the theoretical framework to be used in secs .",
    "[ secao_probabilidade],[secao_parametros],[secao_lyapunov ] , and [ secao_correlacao ] .",
    "then , in sec",
    ". [ secao_aplicacao ] , we apply this approach to analyze the hnon map and the experimental chua s circuit .",
    "we also work with the logistic map in appendix [ apendice ] .    in sec .",
    "[ secao_probabilidade ] , we present a continuous function , @xmath0 that fits well the probability distribution for the prts to regions of finite size . the many parameters of @xmath0 are theoretically estimated in sec .",
    "[ secao_parametros ] .",
    "further , we show how to use these parameters to quantify how stochastic or deterministic the considered system is , under the perspective of the prts . concerning the coefficient of the power - law term ( responsible for the deviation of @xmath0 from the poisson distribution )",
    ", a first approximation furnishes that it is inversely proportional to the average return time .",
    "the longer ( shorter ) is the average return time , the smaller ( larger ) the power - law term , and the more stochastic ( more deterministic ) the prts .    in sec .",
    "[ secao_lyapunov ] , we succinctly describe how to calculate the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy , denoted by @xmath1 , in terms of the number of unstable periodic orbits ( upos ) and of the frequency with which the prt happen . then , we explain how @xmath1 can be calculated in typical physical situations , when the information about the upos is unknown and the only available information is the frequency with which a high probable prt with short length happens .",
    "notice that this frequency can be easily measured even if only a few return times are observed because faster returns are more probable .",
    "alternative methods to calculate the correlation entropy , @xmath2 , a lower bound of @xmath1 , and to calculate @xmath1 from time series were proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath2 is calculated from the correlation decay and in ref .",
    "@xcite by the determination of a generating partition of phase space that preserves the value of the entropy .",
    "but while the method in ref .",
    "@xcite unavoidably suffers from the same difficulties found in the proper calculation of the fractal dimensions from data sets , the method in ref .",
    "@xcite requires the knowledge of the generating partitions , information that is not trivial to be extracted from complex data .",
    "the advantage of the theoretical approach used is its simplicity .",
    "as one can see in eq .",
    "( [ upper_bound3 ] ) , the only information required is the frequency with which high probable prts happen in some regions of the phase space .    in sec .",
    "[ secao_correlacao ] , we show how the prts can be used to calculate the correlation function for short - term returns and an upper bound for long - term returns , a function that indicates how much the future returns are related to the past returns to a finite size region .    other methods to calculate the correlation function from the prts were proposed in refs .",
    "one of the advantages of the proposed theoretical approach is that we could show , in a very trivial way , that if the distribution of the prts has an exponential decay then the correlation function also decays exponentially , a result rigorously demonstrated in @xcite .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ secao_conclusao ] , we present our conclusions and discuss how this approach can be used in an integrated way to characterize experimental data coming from complex systems .",
    "in recent works @xcite , it was shown that the fitted probability density function @xmath3 , of a series of poincar return times @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) to a box @xmath6 of equal _ finite _ sides @xmath7 @xcite , of typical trajectories in a non - uniform hyperbolic attractor on @xmath8 , deviates from the exponential law @xmath9 if the box @xmath6 is placed on some special region of the phase space , where @xmath10 is the probability measure inside it .",
    "this quantity measures the frequency with which a chaotic trajectory visits @xmath6 .",
    "the function @xmath11 describes well the discrete probability distribution function ( pdf ) , denoted by @xmath12 , in axiom - a systems and some classes of non - uniformly hyperbolic systems with exponential decay of correlations ( = chaos with strong mixing properties ) @xcite , for arbitrarily small intervals ( @xmath13 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was hypothesized that for @xmath14 , we have @xmath15 with @xmath16 where @xmath14 represents the prt for which the distribution @xmath17 becomes approximately continuous and @xmath18 .",
    "it was assumed that @xmath19 describes an effective pdf associated mostly with the return of trajectories along the unstable manifold of upos outside the box @xmath6 .",
    "it is the result of the non - hyperbolic nature of the dynamics inside the box , whose probability measure suffers the influence of non - local upos .",
    "the term @xmath20 describes the hyperbolic nature of the dynamics inside the box , the return of trajectories to the box associated with the local dynamics provided by the upos inside the interval .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath21 are obtained by the least square fitting method which minimizes the error between @xmath21 and @xmath12 : @xmath22    in addition , assuming that eq .",
    "( [ return_dist ] ) describes well @xmath12 , then the following equations should be simultaneously satisfied @xmath23 by considering that @xmath17 can be broken in two terms , one that describes its discrete nature , the probability of finding a prt of length @xmath24 , and another that describes its continuous nature .    denoting @xmath25 as to be the prt with the minimum length [ @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and assuming that @xmath28 then @xmath29 and @xmath30 $ ] , for sufficiently small @xmath31 so that the terms that contain @xmath32 , regarded as @xmath33 , can be neglected .",
    "so , for finite @xmath34 , @xmath35 . however , eq . ( [ return_dist ] )",
    "does not seem to completely capture the nature of @xmath17 for finite size intervals .",
    "satisfying conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) do not necessarily minimizes the error in ( [ error ] ) , and the contrary also does not apply .",
    "such disagreement becomes stronger in boxes centered close to homoclinic tangencies . by fitting @xmath17 by a function of the type in eq .",
    "( [ return_dist ] ) might produce @xmath36 , which disagrees with the inequality @xmath35 that validates eq .",
    "( [ return_dist ] ) . for the here considered dynamical systems for parameters far away from intermittent behavior , and data coming from plasma turbulence and stock market @xcite",
    ", one finds often that @xmath37 , a consequence of @xmath17 be greater than @xmath38 , for @xmath39 , and that @xmath40 , for @xmath41 .",
    "these facts suggest that for systems with a dynamics similar to the hnon map , the small term @xmath42 considered to be constant in ref .",
    "@xcite is in fact a function that we hypothesize to be a power - law with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "that lead us to @xmath44\\right)e^{(-\\alpha\\tau^{\\prime } ) } \\label{return_dist1}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a positive small value .",
    "notice that the use of @xmath43 and @xmath47 is only an artifact to simplify our further approximations and also to simplify any possible nonlinear fitting that we might make concerning the real pdf .",
    "the power - law term @xmath48 $ ] shows that the considered systems for which this distribution holds have a return time distribution whose decay is not characterized by either a power - law or exponential decay but by both .",
    "it appears as a combined effect of the finiteness of the box , the expanding factor nearby low - periodic upos along the unstable direction , and the existence of homoclinic tangencies , which gives the non - uniformly hyperbolic character of the hnon map and the chua s circuit .",
    "a large value of @xmath46 ( which implies in a large @xmath49 ) indicates that there is a large contribution to the measure inside the box due to upos that are outside the box .",
    "two things contribute for a large value of @xmath46 : the size and location of the box .",
    "the larger the size and the level of non - hyperbolicity of the box are , the larger the value of @xmath46 is .",
    "we find larger values of @xmath46 when we measure prts in boxes placed close to homoclinic tangencies .",
    "at such a case , trajectory points that have returned once to the box after @xmath50 iterations keep consecutively returning to the box after @xmath50 iterations .",
    "the trajectory is no longer under the influence of the linear expanding character of a period-@xmath50 upo ( along the direction of the unstable eigenvector ) but under the influence of the non - linear character of the unstable manifold of the upo located outside the box .",
    "a sketch of these ideas is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_manifolds ] . in ( a )",
    ", we represent a box that is centered on an upo ( in the figure represented by a full circle and the letter * o * ) .",
    "the box is sufficiently large so that the escape of trajectories from the box which are associated with this upo happens no longer along the unstable eigenvector ( @xmath51 ) but along the unstable manifold ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the smaller is the period of an upo , the smaller is the eigenvalue of the unstable eigenvector .",
    "so , the escape of the trajectory along the unstable manifold is usually expected to happen for a low - period upo . in ( b ) , we represent a box centered in a homoclinic tangent ( in the figure represented by a full square and the letter * t * ) . in the neighborhood of homoclinic tangencies exist low - period upos whose unstable and stable manifold happens to be almost parallel , forming a trapping region . in these trapping regions , the trajectory returns to the box along @xmath53 and eventually escapes the box , but it may return to it along the stable manifold @xmath54 of the upo outside the box . for short returns ,",
    "these confined trajectories contribute positively to @xmath17 , increasing @xmath10 .",
    "we can classify regions @xmath6 by the way returns happen inside it : _ type i _ are the regions whose returns are associated with higher - period upos , here conveniently regarded as the hyperbolic ones . _ type ii and iii _ are the ones associated with lower - period upos , here conveniently regarded as the non - hyperbolic regions . in these regions , the deviation of @xmath3 to the",
    "exponential is large , meaning a large @xmath46 .",
    "for the _ type ii _",
    "regions , the unusual returns that happen inside the interval are associated to upos outside it . such behavior is a consequence of the existence of homoclinic tangencies @xcite inside the region . for the _ type iii _ regions , the unusual returns are associated with lower - period upos inside them .",
    "@xcite . when there is an upo with low period @xmath50 inside the box , @xmath55 is no longer exactly equal to @xmath56 [ given by eq .",
    "( [ mu_nr1 ] ) ] due to the fact that linearization around this low - period upo does not provide the measure due to this upo inside the box .",
    "to estimate @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we make @xmath46=0 ( treating the power - law term as a perturbation ) , and place @xmath3 into eqs .",
    "( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) .",

    "there are three approaches to estimate @xmath59 .",
    "one is by just inspecting when @xmath12 presents a continuous exponential decay .",

    "[ fig_correlacao ] , we show the decay of the correlation function with respect to @xmath85 . notice that this function is local and reflects the decay of correlation of prts to a particular interval .",
    "as expected , the correlation function decays faster in the type i hyperbolic regions [ ( a ) and ( c ) ] than in the type ii non - hyperbolic regions .",

    "but one still wants to understand what kind of dynamics is behind the generation of these returns .",
    "if the region in phase space has an arbitrarily small size , for systems that have strong mixing characteristics , a long return time contains no longer information about the future returns , which means that the consecutive series of returns lose their correlation and they behave as if they had been generated by a completely random process . at such a situation ,",
    "the probability distribution of the prts approaches a poisson distribution @xcite and few can be said about the dynamical manifestations of the data by only considering the form of this distribution .",

    "( [ upper_bound1 ] ) and ( [ upper_bound3 ] ) ] , using the distribution of prts , a quantity that can be easily accessible in experiments .",
    "as the region in phase space where the returns are being measured becomes larger , the first poincar returns reflect more the deterministic nature of the system .",
    "that leads to a large deviation of the density of the returns from the poisson [ see eq .",
    "( [ return_dist1 ] ) ] and a slower decay of correlations for short - term returns [ see eq .",
    "( [ correlation4 ] ) and fig .",

    "each discontinuity identifies particular returns , which makes them to be highly predictable . as shown in sec .",

    "( [ upper_bound2 ] ) and ( [ upper_bound3 ] ) is due to the fact that in non - hyperbolic systems as the hnon map and the experimental chua s circuit the density of the prts for @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath163 , receives a contribution coming from upos outside of @xmath6 , which violates the conditions under which these equations are derived . when the upos are known as it is the case for the hnon map , we use @xmath200 , in eqs .",
