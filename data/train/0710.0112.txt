    "possible realization of molecular bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) from atomic condensate has attracted wide attentions @xcite .",
    "a pair of atoms in open channel can be coupled to a weakly bound molecule by using either photoassociation process @xcite or feshbach resonance method @xcite .",
    "such a coherent conversion of two chemically different species is of fundamental physical interests , and can be regarded as matter - wave analog of second harmonic generation .",
    "it was shown that a direct conversion via one - color free - bound photoassociation ( feshbach resonance ) creates the molecules in highly excited electronic ( vibrational ) levels . moreover ,",
    "statistical property of the molecules exhibits sub - poissonian only at initial stage @xcite , and it will be transformed into super - poissonian due to inherent nonlinearity of the bec @xcite .    to overcome all these problems ,",
    "the second laser field is employed to couple the excited molecules to long - live ground - state molecules .",
    "two - color free - bound - bound mechanism based on the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( the stirap ) was proposed as a promising route to achieve the high efficiency of atom - molecule conversion @xcite .",
    "the stirap relies on the coherent population trapping ( cpt ) state , which is a superposition of two long - lived levels which decouple from the excited levels @xcite . in the atom - molecule bec , the cpt state (",
    "also called as the dark state ) is a superposition of the atomic and molecular ground states , and has been observed in recent experiments @xcite . in principle , one can realize a complete and reversible atom - molecule conversion as long as the system is kept in the cpt state .",
    "however , it was shown the mean - field collisions set a limit to conversion efficiency by about @xmath1@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , ling et al . recognized the cpt condition in the linear atomic system differs from those in the atom - molecule bec .",
    "they found that high conversion efficiency , namely about @xmath2 , is achievable provided that the cpt condition is satisfied during whole time evolution . in their work a single time - varying laser pulse is used for the bound - bound transition , while a constant feshbach magnetic field is applied in the free - bound transition .",
    "the feshbach resonance method was thought to present relatively large free - bound coupling than that of the photoassociation",
    ". however , both methods are actually equivalent in theoretical point of view .",
    "in addition , we note that the highest - conversion efficiency in their work appears near the exact feshbach resonant , which unfortunately leads to strong atomic loss .    in this paper , we study the stirap in the atom - molecule bec by using the frequency modulation scheme @xcite , where two time - varying guassian laser pulses are employed .",
    "our scheme has its advantage to provide additional parameters to optimize the conversion efficiency so that an extreme high conversion efficiency , namely about @xmath0 , can be obtained .",
    "moreover , the highest conversion occurs at far off - detuned region for the free - bound transition , which avoids the loss of atomic bec in the feshbach resonance version of the stirap .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present a simple three - level model for the atom - molecule bec system , and investigate the effects of the mean - field collisions on the cpt condition and dynamical instability . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our numerical results and some discussions . finally , a summary of our paper is presented .",
    "we consider a @xmath3-type atom - molecule system , as shown in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , where a pair of free colliding atoms in level @xmath4 is converted to a bound molecule in level @xmath5 via an intermediate molecular level @xmath6 .",
    "the free - bound transition @xmath7 is characterized by rabi frequency @xmath8 , while the coupling strength @xmath9 corresponds to the bound - bound transition @xmath10 . in practice ,",
    "the atoms in level @xmath4 is a bec gas with density denoted as @xmath11 . due to the bose enhancement , the free - bound rabi frequency @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the detuning for the free - bound and bound - bound transitions are denoted as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , with @xmath15 the central frequencies of the laser fields @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "thus the two - photon ( raman ) detuning is @xmath18 .    following refs .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the atoms and the molecules can be described solely by three bosonic fields . for an atom - molecule bec system with high density , we employ further the standard mean - field treatments , i.e. , replacing the field operators by the normalized field amplitudes @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . from heisenberg equation of the field operators , we obtain the following coupled equations :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 represent two - body collision rate with @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 are s - wave scattering lengths , and @xmath28 are the reduced masses between states @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we neglect mean - field interactions related to the excited molecular state due to small occupation of this state @xcite",
    ". the decay rate @xmath31 is added phenomenologically to take into account the loss of the excited molecules .",
    "-8 cm    it was shown that in a linear @xmath3 three - level system , the cpt state occurs if the two - photon resonance condition @xmath32 is satisfied @xcite .",
    "however , the mean - field collisions probably modify the cpt condition @xcite . to obtain the new condition ,",
    "we neglect temporarily the particle losses , which implies the conservation of particle number i.e. @xmath33 . by introducing @xmath34 ( for @xmath35 ) with the chemical potentials",

    "the cpt solution appears under generalized two - photon resonance condition @xcite : @xmath45 in the absence of collisions @xmath46 , eq .",
    "( [ generalized cpt condition ] ) is just the ordinary two - photon resonance condition .",
    "for two gaussian laser pulses in a counterintuitive order , @xmath47 varies slowly as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "3 .    the mean - field collisions result in dynamical instability of the cpt solutions . to investigate it ,",
    "we employ the standard perturbation theory , i.e. , adding small perturbations to the cpt solutions as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 ( for @xmath35 ) , and @xmath50 is eigenfrequency of the perturbations .",
    "the dynamical instability of the cpt solution takes place when the eigenfrequency is imaginary . in this case",
    ", a weak perturbation may induce an exponential growth of the excited molecules , which in turn lowers remarkably the fraction of ground - state molecules .",

    "the peak of rabi frequency takes the form of @xmath72 mhz , where @xmath73 is the peak atomic density .",

    "3 , we calculate time evolution of the three - component populations for a fixed free - bound detuning @xmath92 , where a blue - detuned laser is adopted to avoid dynamical unstable region .",
    "mean - field collision terms result in dynamical instability of the cpt state for positive @xmath59 , which in turn leads to lower conversion efficiency @xcite . as show by the inset of fig .",
    "3 , with time evolution @xmath47 deceases slightly according to the cpt condition , eq . ( [ generalized cpt condition ] ) . in practice",
    ", such laser frequency modulation can be realized by setting @xmath94 initially , and then increasing it adiabatically to @xmath95 .",

    "4 , the optimal conversion occurs at @xmath91 . the molecular population @xmath101 ( also @xmath105 ) varies slowly with @xmath59 in the blue - detuned region ( negative @xmath59 ) , while it decreases quickly to zero for positive @xmath59 .",
    "this asymmetric variation is aroused from dynamical instability of the cpt in the red - detuned region @xcite .",
    "for the case of @xmath106 ( dashed line ) , however , @xmath101 begins to decrease in the blue - detuned region since for certain parameters the instability can also occur as shown by inset of fig .",

    "therefore , condensate atomic losses in state @xmath64 can be ignored safely .    in the above theoretical treatments ,",
    "we have neglected the decay of stable molecules , @xmath107 . in recent experiment @xcite , however , it was found that @xmath107 is relatively large and depends on the intensity of the first laser , which may lead to very low conversion rate .",
    "there are several reasons that lead to dramatic losses of the ground - state molecules .",
    "firstly , the counter - rotating couplings of the two raman lasers give contribution to incoherent loss of the stable molecules .",
    "secondly , the coupling of other vibrational molecular levels near level @xmath108 break the ideal three - level system , and provide addition loss channels .",
    "finally , the rogue dissociation of the molecule itself also give negative contributions to the atom - molecule conversion .",
    "in fact , the obtained molecular fraction @xmath109 , i.e. , only hundreds of ground - state molecules are prepared from the @xmath62rb bec of about @xmath110 atoms@xcite .",
    "such a low conversion is caused not only from the decay of the stable molecules mentioned above , but also because of an extremely weak free - bound coupling used in the experiment . to overcome the latter problem a large franck - condom overlap integral for the free - bound transition is crucially needed . by carefully choosing suitable molecular levels",
    ", one can increase the conversion efficiency by several orders of magnitude .     for various time delays .",
    "the second pulse center @xmath90 is fixed . by increasing @xmath71 ,",
    "the first pulse centers are chosen as @xmath102 ( the dashed line ) , @xmath103 ( the solid line ) , and @xmath104 ( the dotted line ) .",

    "in summary , the efficient conversion between atomic bec s and the stable molecular bec s has been investigated by using the frequency modulation stirap scheme .",
    "the effects of the mean - field collisions on the cpt condition and dynamical instability are also discussed .",
    "we find that dynamical instability of the cpt solution can also occurs in the blue detuned region due to negative atom - molecule interactions .",
    "a very high conversion efficiency about @xmath0 can be obtained by choosing optimally the free - bound detuning and time delay of the two raman lasers .",
