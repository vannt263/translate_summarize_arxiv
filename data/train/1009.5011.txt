    "the negatively charged pions and kaons can be trapped in the coulomb potential of atomic nucleus forming so called pionic ( kaonic ) atoms .",
    "observations of such atoms allows for studies of strong interaction of pions and kaons with atomic nuclei on the basis of shifts and widths of the energy levels  @xcite .",
    "it is also conceivable that a neutral meson could be bound to a nucleus . in this case",
    "the binding is exclusively due to the strong interaction and hence such object can be called a _",

    "may be bound by a similar mechanism as states of @xmath1 with the difference that in the case of @xmath1 nucleons are excited to the @xmath2 and in the case of @xmath0 meson to the @xmath3 resonant state .",
    "we may thus picture  @xcite the formation and decay of the @xmath0-mesic nucleus as the @xmath0 meson absorption by one of the nucleons leading to the creation of the @xmath3 and then its propagation through the nucleus until it decays into the pion - nucleon pair which escapes from the nucleus . predicted values of the width of such states range from @xmath47 to @xmath440  mev  @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to stress that the width and binding energy of the eta - nucleus bound states depends strongly on the not well known subthreshold @xmath0-nucleon interaction  @xcite making impossible an unambiguous prediction as regards the bound states , and , therefore , direct measurements are necessary  @xcite .",
    "the search of the @xmath0  -  mesic nucleus was conducted in many inclusive experiments  @xcite via reactions induced by pions  @xcite , protons  @xcite , and photons  @xcite .",
    "many promising indications of the existence of such an object were reported  @xcite , but so far none was independently confirmed .",

    "we report on searches of the @xmath0  -  mesic helium in exclusive measurements carried out at the cooler synchrotron cosy by means of the wasa - at - cosy  @xcite and cosy-11  @xcite detector setups .",
    "we present also suggestion of studies of @xmath0-mesic tritium with quasi - free reactions at the cosy - tof facility .",
    "we consider the study of the @xmath0-mesic nuclei as interesting on its own account , but additionally it is useful for investigations of ( i ) the @xmath0n interaction , ( ii ) the n@xmath5 properties in nuclear matter  @xcite , ( iii ) the properties of the @xmath0 meson in the nuclear medium  @xcite , and ( iv ) the flavour singlet component of the @xmath0 meson  @xcite .",
    "in 1985 bhalerao and liu  @xcite performed a coupled - channel analysis of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 reactions and came to conclusion that the interaction between the nucleon and the @xmath0 meson is attractive . based on this finding",
    "haider and liu postulated the existence of the @xmath0mesic nuclei  @xcite , in which the electrically neutral @xmath0 meson might be bound with the nucleons by the strong interaction .",
    "the formation of such a bound state can only take place if the real part of the @xmath0-nucleus scattering length is negative ( attraction ) , and the magnitude of the real part is greater than the magnitude of the imaginary part  @xcite . in the 1980 s the @xmath0mesic nuclei were considered to exists for a  @xmath9  12  only  @xcite due to the relatively small value of the @xmath0n scattering length ( @xmath10  fm  @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent theoretical investigations of hadronic- and photo - production of the @xmath0 meson result in values of the real part of @xmath11 which depending on the analysis method range from 0.25  fm up to 1.05  fm  @xcite , and which do not exclude the formation of bound @xmath0-nucleus states for such light nuclei as helium  @xcite or even for deuteron  @xcite . according to the calculations including multiple scattering theory  @xcite or skyrme model",
    "@xcite an especially good candidate for binding is the @xmath12 system .",
    "recent calculations by haider  @xcite or tryasuchev and isaev  @xcite also indicate the binding in the @xmath12 system , while they rather exclude the existence of the @xmath13 state . on the other hand",
    "there are promising experimental signals which may be interpreted as indications of the the @xmath14 bound state , as for example the shape of the excitation function for the @xmath15 reaction  @xcite determined by the spes-4  @xcite , spes-2  @xcite , cosy-11  @xcite , and cosy - anke  @xcite collaborations  ( fig .",

    "@xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it has been indicated by wilkin  @xcite that a steep rise of the total cross section in the very close - to - threshold region followed by a plateau may be due to the existence of a pole of the @xmath17 scattering amplitude in the complex excess energy plane @xmath18 with @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "this reference shows that the occurrence of the pole changes the phase and the magnitude of the s - wave production amplitude . and indeed ,",
    "the momentum dependence of the asymmetry in the angular distributions of @xmath20 expressed in terms of the asymmetry parameter @xmath16  @xcite , can only be satisfactorily described ( solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) ) if a very strong phase variation associated with the pole is included in the fits  @xcite .",
    "otherwise there is a significant discrepancy between the experimental data and the theoretical description ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) ) .",
    "details of the experimental technique  @xcite and a comprehensive description of results concerning the search of the @xmath0-mesic @xmath23 nucleus conducted by the cosy-11 group were described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "therefore , here we only summarize the main results .",
    "the measurements were carried out using the deuteron beam of cosy which was circulating through the stream of the internal hydrogen target of the cluster - jet type  @xcite .",
    "data were taken during a slow acceleration of the beam from 3.095  gev / c to 3.180  gev / c , crossing the kinematical threshold for the @xmath0 production in the @xmath24 reaction at 3.141  gev / c .",
    "the corresponding variation of the excess energy in the @xmath25 system ranged from -10  mev to + 9  mev .",
    "for the scanned beam momentum interval we determined excitation functions for the pion production in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 reaction which were chosen out of possible decay channels of the @xmath0-mesic @xmath28 .",
    "a signature of existence of the @xmath21 bound state was based on observation of a resonance like structure with the center lying below the @xmath0 production threshold in the measured excitation curves .    for the @xmath26 channel we concentrated on differential cross sections for the forward pion angles ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this choice was dictated by the fact that the @xmath30 cross section is up to two orders of magnitude smaller at the forward angles than at the most backward angles .",
    "assuming that the searched structure is produced isotropically , one can expect that it can be best seen just at the forward angles since it appears on the level of small `` non - resonant '' cross section .",
    "the determined excitation function for the @xmath31 process does not show any structure which could originate from a decay of @xmath32 bound state @xcite .",
    "the estimated upper limit for the cross section of the @xmath33 reaction chain is equal to 70  nb .",
    "this limit appears not very restrictive at least under assumption that the cross sections for the @xmath34 bound state formation are of the same order as the @xmath35 cross sections near threshold ( 0.4  @xmath36b ) , and that other possible decay channels like @xmath37 or @xmath38are more favorable .",
    "we expect that @xmath39 is one of the favorable decay channels of the @xmath32 bound state since it corresponds to one step process of absorption of the @xmath0 meson on the neutron inside the @xmath40 nucleus in the reaction @xmath41 . in the @xmath42 rest frame the pion and the proton",
    "are emitted back - to - back with momenta of about 430  mev / c . in the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) system",
    "these momenta are smeared due to the fermi motion of the neutron inside the @xmath40 nucleus .",
    "however , they are significantly larger than the momenta of the two remaining protons which are in the order of 100  mev / c , and which play the role of `` spectators '' .",
    "the counting rate of all identified @xmath27 events including the quasi - free @xmath43 production stays constant in the scanned range of the beam momentum ( see fig .  [",

    "events as a function of the beam momentum without any cuts ( a ) and after rejection of events corresponding to the quasi - free @xmath43 production ( b ) .",
    "the dashed line represents calculations of the @xmath0 absorption described in the text.,title=\"fig : \" ]    however , after rejection of the quasi - free events , the number of @xmath27 counts in the beam momentum interval above the @xmath0 threshold is higher than the number of counts in the interval of equal width below the threshold ( see fig .",
    "[ ppppi_counts]b ) .",
    "this difference is equal to @xmath44 and its statistical significance is of @xmath45 .",
    "the observation of this effect was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a possible reaction mechanism explaining the observed enhancement we suggested the production of `` on - shell '' @xmath0 mesons in the reaction @xmath46 which subsequently are absorbed in the @xmath40 nucleus and converted to negatively charged pions in the interaction with the neutron .    for testing the @xmath0 absorption hypothesis we estimated the counting rate of the @xmath27 events assuming that the absorption cross section @xmath47 is equal to the cross section for the @xmath46 reaction ( for more details see ref .",
    "this assumption is justified by the observation that the real and imaginary part of the @xmath34 scattering length @xcite have comparable values .",
    "the result of our estimation multiplied by a factor of 10 is shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ ppppi_counts]b .",
    "it underestimates the experimental counts roughly by an order of magnitude and thus it does not corroborate the @xmath0 absorption hypothesis .",
    "for testing this hypothesis we analysed also momentum and angular distributions of the final state particles in the @xmath48 reaction .",
    "the experimental distribution of the pion momentum in the c.m .",
    "system is centred around 430  mev / c as expected for pions originating from the decay of the @xmath3 .",
    "it agrees with results of simulations of the @xmath0 absorption .",
    "however , the momentum distribution of the proton with the highest momentum , which we call the leading proton , is centred at around 300  mev / c and is lower than the corresponding distribution for the @xmath0 absorption grouped around 430  mev / c .",
    "a disagreement takes place also in the case of the distribution of the center - of - mass angles between the pion momentum vector and the momentum vector of the leading proton which in the case of simulations of the @xmath0 absorption are close to @xmath49 and for the experiment lie around @xmath50 .",
    "one can expect , that due to very similar kinematical conditions , absorption of the @xmath0 mesons bound in the @xmath40 nucleus is characterized by differential distributions which are very close to ones predicted in our simulations for the absorption of `` on - shell '' @xmath0 mesons . in particular one can expect that the @xmath51 pairs originating from the decay of the @xmath0-mesic @xmath40 are emitted at c.m .",
    "angles concentrated predominately in the range @xmath52 as it is the case for the @xmath0 meson absorption . in this angular range , there are only two experimental counts . assuming , that these two counts originate from the decay of the @xmath53 bound state",
    ", we estimated the cross section for the production of such a state in @xmath22 collisions close to the @xmath0 production threshold .",
    "the resulting cross section of @xmath54  @xmath36b should be considered as an upper limit for the production cross section of the @xmath0-mesic @xmath55 since the observed two events might originate from other processes than the bound state decay .",
    "data collected in the cosy-11 measurements with the ramped deuteron beam were also used to investigate the cusp effect observed at saturne in the threshold excitation curve for the process @xmath56 @xcite . as suggested by wilkin @xcite , the cusp visible in the saturne data below the @xmath0 threshold",
    "could be caused by an interference between an intermediate state including the @xmath0 meson and the non - resonant background corresponding to the multi - pion production . in the saturne experiment",
    "the @xmath55 ejectiles were measured with the spes  iv spectrometer which was set in such a way that it registered the @xmath55 which was approximately at rest in the c.m . frame .",
    "since the cosy-11 momentum and angular acceptance was much larger than one of the spes  iv spectrometer , the limitation on the c.m .",
    "momenta of @xmath55 was realized by means of corresponding cuts during the data analysis @xcite .",
    "contrary to the saturne result no cusp below the @xmath0 threshold was observed @xcite .",
    "the installation of the wasa detector at cosy opened a unique possibility to search for the @xmath58 bound state with high statistics and high acceptance .",
    "we conduct a search via an exclusive measurement of the excitation function for the @xmath59 reaction varying continuously the beam momentum around the threshold for the @xmath60 reaction .",
    "ramping of the beam momentum and taking advantage of the large acceptance of the wasa detector reaction the acceptance of the wasa - at - cosy detector equals to almost 70% . ] allows to minimize systematical uncertainties making the wasa - at - cosy a unique facility  @xcite for such kind of exclusive experiments .",
    "the @xmath61 bound state should manifest itself as a resonant like structure below the threshold for the @xmath62 reaction .",
    "if a peak below the @xmath63 threshold is found , then the profile of the excitation curve will allow to determine the binding energy and the width of the @xmath64 bound state .",
    "if , however , only an enhancement around the threshold is found , then it will enable to establish the relation between width and binding energy  @xcite .",
    "finally , if no structure is seen the upper limit for the cross section of the production of the @xmath0-helium nucleus will be set .",
    "in addition , when searching for the signal of the @xmath0-mesic state we may take advantage of the fact that the distribution of the relative angle between the @xmath65 pair for the background ( due to the prompt @xmath66 reaction ) is much broader than the one expected from the decay of the bound state .",
    "this is because the relative angle between the outgoing @xmath65 pair originating from the decay of the n@xmath5 resonance is equal to 180@xmath67 in the n@xmath68 reference frame and it is smeared only by about 30@xmath67 in the reaction center - of - mass frame due to the fermi motion of the nucleons inside the @xmath69 nucleus .",

    "the ratio of excitation functions from various angular ranges is also constant as indicated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . therefore , taking into account the luminosity and the detector acceptance we preliminary estimated that an upper limit for the eta - mesic helium production via the @xmath76 reaction is equal to about 20  nb on a one sigma level",
    ". the experiment will be continued in november 2010 .",
    "however , we can not estimate the statistics required for the observation of the signal since it is a priori impossible to predict in a model independent way a cross section for the creation of the eta - mesic nucleus , which strongly depends on the strength of the relatively poorly known @xmath0-nucleon interaction , and which involves computations of the behaviour of the many - body system .",
    "therefore , based on the fact that the real and imaginary part of the helium-@xmath0 scattering length are almost of the same value we estimate the cross section for the creation of the eta - mesic helium applying the assumption that the probability of the production of the @xmath0 meson in continuum and its absorption on the helium nucleus is of the same order .",
    "this leads to the hypothesis that the cross section for the creation of the bound state below the threshold ( which is than connected with the absorption of the @xmath0 meson on the helium nucleus ) is in the first order the same as the close to threshold cross section for the @xmath0 meson production .",
    "therefore , for the estimation of the counting rate in the future measurements we assume that the cross section in the maximum of the breit - wigner distribution for the @xmath77 production is about 15 nb as measured for the @xmath78 reaction  @xcite .",
    "further on , we assume , that the probability of decay of the @xmath61 bound state into the @xmath79 channel is equal to @xmath80 . the factor @xmath81 takes into account the fact that there are four possible @xmath0 absorption channels : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 . in turns ,",
    "the factor @xmath86 represents our guess of the probability that the three observer nucleons ( @xmath87 ) , in the process of the @xmath0 absorption on the neutron in @xmath88 , form @xmath55 in the final state .",
    "estimation of this effect needs , in our understanding of the problem , projection of the @xmath88 wave function on the wave function of the @xmath89 pair and inclusion of the pion and proton rescattering on the observer nucleons .",
    "since , this kind of estimations is nt at present in our reach , we justify our guess using an analogy between the decay of the @xmath61 nuclei and the @xmath90-hypernuclei . for the later case",
    "it was observed namely that in the @xmath43 decay channel the decay mode @xmath91 is dominant @xcite .",
    "the above considerations implies that the cross section for the @xmath92 reaction should be in the order of 2  nb .",
    "this level of sensitivity can be reached in the experiment which will be continued in november 2010  @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainties in establishing the shape of the excitation functions discussed in the previous sections are significantly reduced by using the momentum ramping technique since the energy range of interest for the search of the @xmath0-mesic nucleus is scanned in each cosy cycle .",
