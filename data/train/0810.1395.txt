    "precise cross - sections of secondary hadron production from the interactions of protons and pions with nuclei are , _ inter alia _ , of importance for the understanding of the characteristics of muons from the decay of pions that are produced by the proton driver of a neutrino factory .",
    "surprisingly , inclusive differential cross - sections of hadron production in the interactions of few gev/_c _ protons with nuclei are known only within a factor of two to three .",
    "consequently , the harp detector was designed to carry out a programme of systematic and precise measurements of hadron production by protons and pions with momenta from 1.5 to 15  gev/_c_.    the detector combined a forward spectrometer with a large - angle spectrometer .",
    "the latter comprised a cylindrical time projection chamber ( tpc ) around the target and an array of resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) that surrounded the tpc .",
    "the purpose of the tpc was track reconstruction and particle identification by .",
    "the purpose of the rpcs was to complement the particle identification by time of flight .",
    "the harp experiment was performed at the cern proton synchrotron in 2001 and 2002 with a set of stationary targets ranging from hydrogen to lead , including beryllium .",
    "we have measured  @xcite the inclusive cross - sections of the large - angle production ( polar angle @xmath3 in the range from 20 to 125@xmath4 ) of secondary protons and charged pions in the interactions with a 5% @xmath0 beryllium target of protons and pions with beam momenta of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10  gev/_c_.",
    "for the work reported here , only the harp large - angle spectrometer was used  @xcite .",
    "its salient technical characteristics are stated in table  [ lacharacteristics ] .",
    "the good particle identification capability stemming from  in the tpc and from time of flight in the rpc s is demonstrated in fig .",

    "[ comparisonwithe802ande910andoh ] shows the cross - section @xmath11 of @xmath12 production by @xmath13  gev/_c _ protons , in the polar - angle range @xmath14 , published by the e910 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "their data are compared with our cross - sections from the interactions of @xmath15  gev/_c _ protons , expressed in e910 units .",

    "their data are compared with our respective cross - sections , expressed in the units used by the harp collaboration .",
    "we note striking disagreement .    as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite and in references cited therein , the harp collaboration s data analysis is affected by their lack of understanding of tpc track distortions which leads to ( i ) a bias of @xmath16  ( gev/_c_)@xmath17 ; ( ii ) a resolution of @xmath18  ( gev/_c_)@xmath17 which is by a factor of two worse than claimed by them ; and ( iii ) a bad overall rpc time - of - flight resolution of 305  ps and an apparent advance of the timing signal of protons with respect to that of pions by @xmath19500  ps ( ` 500  ps effect ' ) .",
    "all this causes distorted momentum spectra of secondary hadrons especially in regions where there is a strong momentum dependence , and the misidentification of protons as pions .",
    "the harp collaboration s pion production cross - sections are fatally biased and unsuitable for the design of a neutrino factory .",
