    "sequences often arise from recursion relations .",
    "difference equations , which have been of great interest in previous decades , are known to fall in this category .",
    "in fact , this type of equation has attracted the attentions of many mathematicians in recent years .",
    "this curiosity , as we have witnessed , continuous to grow as more fascinating results are obtained and presented in recent studies .",
    "interestingly , in some cases , difference equations may be solve in closed - forms ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in some instances , the solutions of these equations may be shown to be periodic . in regards to this intriguing behavior , we say that a solution of a given difference equation , say @xmath0 ( which is of order @xmath1 ) , is _ periodic _ or _ eventually periodic _ with period @xmath2 if we can find an integer @xmath3 such that the relation @xmath4 holds for all @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "difference equations may be classified as _ linear _ and _ nonlinear _ types .",
    "a classical example of a linear type is the well - known fibonacci sequence @xmath6 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) which has been generalized by many authors in various forms ( see , for instance , the so - called horadam sequence @xcite ) . quite recently",
    ", these sequences have been applied in the study of functional and differential equations ( see @xcite , and the references therein ) . on the other hand ,",
    "nonlinear types may be regarded as ratios of linear difference equations .",
    "the simplest example of such type is the difference equation @xmath7 with a real initial value @xmath8 .",
    "we mention that the @xmath9-th term of the fibonacci sequence @xmath10 is known to be solvable explictly in @xmath9 , i.e. , we may express the @xmath9-th term fibonacci number @xmath11 in binet s form @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the widely known _",
    "golden ratio_. clearly , the fibonacci sequence is unbounded and grows exponentially to infinity as @xmath9 increases without bound .",
    "in contrast to this behavior , every solutions of the difference equation , regardless of its initial value , is periodic with period @xmath14 .",
    "this is seen easily as follows : since @xmath15 , then iterating the left hand side one - step lower yields the relation @xmath16 , from which it is evident that the sequence is periodic with periodicity @xmath14 . knowing if a sequence is periodic or not in advance has some sort of advantage in solving systems of difference equations .",
    "it will , possibly , lessen ones effort in establishing the form of solutions of these types of equations .",
    "for example , if we know for instance that a solution of a difference equation is eventually periodic , starting from some index @xmath17 , with period @xmath18 and we find it difficult to establish its solution form , then , perhaps , we can at least manually find their forms by iteratively computing term by term their respective forms up to the @xmath19-th term of the solution sequence .",
    "arguably , difference equations have many applications , not only in various fields of mathematics , but also in related sciences ( see , e.g. , a very recent book by mickens @xcite ) . in fact , as it is popularly known , the origin of fibonacci sequence outside india @xcite came from the book _ liber abaci _ ( 1202 ) by leonardo of pisa from which the sequence is describe as the ideal ( biologically unrealistic ) growth pattern of rabbits ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover , the sequence which is known to be generated by the difference equation @xmath20 ( with initial values @xmath21 ) has applications in computer algorithm ( cf .",
    "they also appear in biological settings , such as branching in trees , _",
    "phyllotaxis _ or the arrangement of leaves of stem @xcite , the fruit sprouts of a pineapple @xcite , the flowering of an artichoke , an uncurling fern and the arrangement of a pine cone s bracts @xcite , etc .",
    "nonlinear types of difference equations also posses numerous applications in pure mathematics and related sciences .",
    "for instance , the newton s method ( or newton - raphson s method ) , which is known as a root - finding algorithm , uses the nonlinear difference equation @xmath22 to approximate roots ( or zeroes ) of real - valued function @xmath23 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "the initial value @xmath24 is describe as the initial guess or iterate of the iteration process .",
    "other applications in related sciences , such as in theoretical biology , also appear in countless literatures ( see , e.g. , @xcite and other related literatures cited therein ) . in a modeling",
    "setting , the two - dimensional _ competitive system _ of nonlinear difference equations @xmath25 represents the rule by which two discrete competitive populations reproduce from one generation to the next . in this context , the phase variables @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote population sizes during the @xmath9-th generation of a given population . the sequence or orbit @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , describes how the populations evolve over time .",
    "the system is describe as a competition between the populations because of the fact that the transition function for each population is a decreasing function of the other population size .",
    "in @xcite , hassell and comins studied a discrete ( difference ) single age - class model for two - species competition and investigated the stability properties of its solutions .",
    "evidently , difference equations appear abundantly in nature and have many applications in biology , ecology and epidemiology @xcite , economy @xcite , physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and so on . because of its importance in science , these equations will no doubt attract the attentions of many scientists and especially the interest of mathematicians .",
    "another reason which possibly creates greater interest in this topic is the challenge of understanding the behavior of solutions of these types of equations .",
    "in fact , some difference equations appear simple in forms but the behavior of their solutions , as we have said , are difficult and sometimes too complex to completely undrestand .    in this study",
    ", we aim to describe the qualitative behavior of solutions of some systems of nonlinear difference equations .",
    "this investigation is motivated by earlier results in this area , wherein different systems of difference equations have been solved in closed - forms .",
    "we have seen that several earlier results concerning the form of solutions of these types of equations were established through the principle of induction , and no further justifications on how these formulae were obtained are stated .",
    "our specific purpose here is to fill these gaps and provide theoretical explanations on how these results can be established analytically .",
    "we mention that we did a similar investigation in @xcite wherein we studied the system of nonlinear difference equations @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a positive integer with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath18 is an even number , both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are nonzero real constants , and the initial values @xmath36 , @xmath37 are nonzero real numbers . in our previous work @xcite , we are able to answer completely an open question raised by yang et al . in @xcite .",
    "that is , we are able to describe the behavior of solutions of the system when @xmath38 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath18 is an even number .",
    "we have particularly found that every solution of this system when @xmath38 , with @xmath2 , is unbounded whenever @xmath31 is odd .",
    "however , a periodic solution of the given system occurs when @xmath39 and @xmath40 is odd . in this case",
    ", the period of the solution appears to be equal to the least common multiple of @xmath18 and @xmath41 . on the other hand , a similar behavior as for the case when @xmath31 is odd",
    "was observed when @xmath39 and @xmath40 is even .",
    "it is worth mentioning that other related papers also appeared in literature before ours @xcite , see , for example , cinar @xcite , cinar and yalinkaya @xcite , cinar et al .",
    "@xcite , elsayed @xcite , irianin and liu @xcite , zban @xcite and yang et al . @xcite . with our set objective",
    ", we shall revisit two recent studies ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and present more results regarding the topic discussed in these papers .",
    "in the first part of our paper , we consider the system of difference equations @xmath42 with positive initial values @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the above system was first studied in @xcite by bayram and da , wherein they obtained a result regarding the behavior of solution of system [ system ] :    [ main ] let @xmath43 and @xmath44 be positive real numbers for some integer @xmath45 .",
    "then , every solution of the system [ system ] is periodic with period @xmath46 .",
    "the above result was established in @xcite in a quite laborious manner .",
    "more specifically , the authors @xcite were able to show the validity of the above theorem by computing iteratively the form of solutions of the system [ system ] .",
    "evidently , this method requires much time and effort before one can able to find exactly the periodicity of solution of the given system .",
    "one of our object here in this work is to provide an alternative approach in determining the periodicity of periodic solution of system [ system ] .",
    "this approach , as we will see later on , shall be more appreciated because of its simplicity and elegance .",
    "another recent work which shall be revisited here is due to elsayed @xcite . in @xcite , elsayed investigated the behavior of solutions of several instances of the following system of nonlinear difference equations @xmath47 he particularly studied the solutions of the above system with ( i ) @xmath48 , ( ii ) @xmath49 and ( iii ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 is some positive integer .",
    "it was shown that the system , with the given cases , have periodic and unbounded solutions depending on some set requirements on the initial values .",
    "most , but not all , of these results was substantiated by elsayed with the same approach used by bayram and da @xcite .",
    "however , we have found that there is an error in one of the result stated in @xcite . perhaps because the result was not supported by any analytical justifications .",
    "hence , in this work , we shall correct this mistake and offer some theoretical explanations on the results presented in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section ( section 2 ) , we shall provide a theoretical explanation of theorem [ main ] , which can also be viewed as another way to prove the theorem . in section 3",
    ", we investigate the behavior of solutions of the system of difference equations @xmath52 and determine the conditions for which the system will have a periodic or unbounded solutions . in section 4 ,",
    "we establish , in a way different from elsayed @xcite , the form of solutions of the above system when @xmath53 is odd and @xmath54 ( see systems [ s3 ] and [ s4 ] ) .",
    "for completeness , we shall accompany our results with several illustrations .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we provide a summary of our present work . before we further proceed in our work",
    ", we note that term sequences and difference equations will be interchangeably use throughout our discussion .",
    "throughout the proof we denote the solution of system [ system ] with @xmath55 . to begin with ,",
    "we eliminate @xmath56 in system [ system ] to obtain the one - dimensional difference equation @xmath57 given that the initial values @xmath44 are positive real numbers , we can then take the natural logarithm of both sides of the latter equation yielding the relation @xmath58 defining @xmath59 , we can equivalently write as follows @xmath60 the above relation is obviously a linear recurrence equation of degree @xmath61 . using the ansatz @xmath62 for some",
    "@xmath63 , equation therefore has the characteristic equation @xmath64 letting @xmath65 in @xmath66 , we obtain the transformed equation @xmath67 now , it is evident that the complex conjugate roots of @xmath68 is of order @xmath69 ( i.e. , if @xmath70 satisfies @xmath71 , then @xmath72 ) , all of which are found on the unit disk @xmath73 .",
    "this can be seen easily from the fact that the polynomial equation @xmath74 has roots @xmath75 .",
    "it follows that @xmath76 are the roots of @xmath66 .",
    "clearly , since the roots of @xmath68 are distinct , then so are the roots of @xmath66 , i.e. , all roots of @xmath66 are simple . hence , the sequence @xmath77 has the explicit formula of the form @xmath78 for some real numbers @xmath79 , where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , are roots of the polynomial equation @xmath66 . with this notation , we see that @xmath82 , for all @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath84 , for all @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "so , from formula , we have @xmath87 for all @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the sequence @xmath77 is periodic of period @xmath89 .",
    "going back to the relation @xmath90 , we see that the sequence @xmath91 is periodic with period @xmath92 .",
    "similarly , @xmath93 is periodic with the same period .",
    "this proves theorem [ main ] .",
    "we remark that the proof of theorem [ main ] also provides a method for determining the existence of periodic solution of similar system of difference equations reducible to linear recurrence equations .",
    "once that the corresponding characteristic equation of the transformed equation contains a repeated root , then we can argue that every solution of the given system is unbounded .",
    "this idea shall be later on use to deal with the behavior of solutions of another system of nonlinear difference equations .",
    "let @xmath53 and @xmath95 be fixed positive integers . in this section",
    "we consider the system of difference equations @xmath96 with nonzero real initial conditions @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 .",
    "hereafter , we denote the solution of the above system by @xmath100 . some particular cases of [ system2 ] were first studied in @xcite : @xmath101 where @xmath51 are some positive integer .",
    "it was shown by elsayed in @xcite that all solutions to system [ s1 ] are periodic with period @xmath102 , while he stated without proof that all solutions to system [ s2 ] are periodic with period @xmath103 when @xmath104 and periodic with period @xmath105 when @xmath106 .",
    "elsayed also showed in @xcite that when @xmath107 , then all solutions of system [ s3 ] are periodic with period @xmath108 .",
    "meanwhile , if @xmath109 in system [ s3 ] , then the solutions are unbounded .",
    "this latter result is seen to be a consequence of the form of solutions of system [ s3 ] established in the paper .",
    "finally , he had shown in @xcite that every solution to system [ s4 ] are also periodic of period @xmath110 when @xmath111 and are unbounded when either @xmath109 or @xmath112 .",
    "the latter statement of this last - mentioned result , however , is erroneous , but can be fixed with additional conditions on @xmath53 , as we shall see later on in our forthcoming discussion .",
    "we emphasize that the results regarding the periodicity of periodic solutions of systems [ s1][s4 ] were all established in @xcite through the same approach used by bayram and da @xcite .",
    "that is , by iteratively computing for the value of each @xmath26 ( resp .",
    "@xmath27 ) until they arrive at a relation showing that @xmath113 ( resp .",
    "@xmath114 ) for some integer @xmath2 .    in the sequel",
    "we shall determine the periodicity of periodic solutions of systems [ s1][s4 ] through the same method we used in proving theorem [ main ] .",
    "we accompany each of our results with illustrative examples where the initial values are randomly taken from the unit interval @xmath115 .",
    "now , since systems [ s1][s4 ] are particular cases of [ system2 ] , we go directly on the problem of determining the periodicity of periodic solution of system [ system2 ] , and then branch out from this system by treating individually all of its possible cases which will naturally arise from the original system .      first , we suppose that @xmath116 .",
    "hence , we have the system @xmath117 from which follows that @xmath118 this simply shows that if @xmath116 , then every solution to [ system2 ] is periodic with period @xmath61 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the behavior of solutions of [ system2 ] when @xmath116 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath119 and @xmath107 .",
    "then , multiplying @xmath56 and @xmath120 , we get @xmath121 if , in particular , @xmath122 , then the above relation reduces to @xmath123 given that @xmath107 , then it follows immediately that @xmath124 for all @xmath125 .",
    "going back to system [ system2 ] , we see that when @xmath122 , then @xmath126 for any integer @xmath127 .",
    "this relation implies that the sequence @xmath91 is periodic with period @xmath1 , which also means that @xmath93 is periodic with the same period .",
    "thus , every solution to system [ system2 ] when @xmath122 and @xmath128 is periodic with period @xmath1 .    from our previous discussion , we can recover elsayed s result for the behavior of solution of system [ system2 ] when @xmath122 and @xmath129 for some integer @xmath130 .",
    "that is , we see that all solutions of system [ s3 ] when @xmath107 are indeed periodic with period @xmath110 ( cf .",

    "hence , all roots of [ system ] are simple , and the @xmath9-th term @xmath144 of the sequence satisfying the recurrence relation [ an ] has the explicit formula of the form @xmath145 for some real numbers @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "since all roots of @xmath140 lie on the unit disk @xmath73 , and @xmath148 for each @xmath149 and @xmath150 for each @xmath151 , then arguing as in the proof of theorem [ main ] , we get @xmath152 for all @xmath153 .",
