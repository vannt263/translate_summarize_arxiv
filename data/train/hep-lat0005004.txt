    "a major embarrassment of lattice field theory in the context of qcd has disappeared : we now have a way to preserve chiral symmetry on the lattice  @xcite , and the all important theoretical understanding of `` soft '' physics consequences of chiral symmetry at the lagrangian level can be taken over from the continuum to the lattice . naturally , one is eager to exploit this development in numerical qcd , and at the moment there are two ways that have been explored : one is the so called domain wall fermion approach  @xcite , and the other is based on implementing  @xcite a rational approximation to the sign function of the overlap dirac operator  @xcite .",
    "the relation between the two is elucidated in  @xcite .",
    "one conclusion from  @xcite could be that with computers immensely more powerful than the ones we have at present it would nt matter which approach one uses for numerical qcd . in practice ,",
    "the two methods are quite different , and it is important to assess their relative strengths and weaknesses .    to compare methods one needs to separate the quenched case from the dynamical case : in a dynamical hybrid monte carlo simulation one needs to invert the dirac operator often , at each step of the so called `` trajectory '' .",
    "the inversions do not generate propagators used in computing physical observables , except when the trajectory is completed and the change in gauge fields accepted . in a quenched simulation one",
    "extracts physics results from each set of fermion propagators .",
    "thus , the comparison of overall fractional costs for inversions works out differently in the quenched and in the dynamical case .",
    "it seems that the overlap approach has some advantage in the quenched case : it has been possible to do simulations at very low quark masses  @xcite , lower than what was achieved with domain wall fermions  @xcite . to be sure ,",
    "a systematic and complete comparison has not been carried out , so this is more an impression than a hard fact .",
    "the reason for the difference is that with the overlap it has been possible to better handle the cases where the hermitian wilson dirac operator , @xmath3 , has eigenvalues very close to zero .",
    "numerical investigation has shown that there is a finite density of eigenvalues very close to zero at typical lattice couplings used in lattice simulations  @xcite . while this is a problem for both domain walls  @xcite and overlap , in the overlap case one can exploit the simple local structure of @xmath3 and project out the troublesome states  @xcite .",
    "this is expensive , but needs to be done only once per gauge field configuration and will help in the calculation of all propagators at this gauge field .",
    "thus , the extra expense is amortized in the quenched case . a similar projection method in the case of domain wall fermions",
    "might make both methods equal . until very recently there existed no practical implementation of a projection technique in the domain wall context , but this is changing as we write  @xcite .    at the dynamical level",
    "it always was felt that domain wall fermions were superior because the action was quite standard in form and one needed only one conjugate gradient inversion , rather than the two nested ones required by the rational overlap  @xcite . here again , this is more an impression than a hard fact because one ought to take into account condition numbers , matrix sizes and the possibility to use projectors .",
    "but , superficially at least , it is hard to ignore the advantage of domain wall fermions with a straightforward action and a relatively well tested algorithm .",
    "the latter distinction between the implementation of domain wall fermions and rational overlap fermions could be eliminated however  @xcite by undoing what the overlap does relative to domain wall fermions .",
    "one reintroduces extra fields which interact quadratically by a sparse hermitian matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the main requirement of @xmath0 is the following : there exists one massless field , @xmath4 , such that integrating out all the other fields produces for @xmath4 a specific effective action @xmath5 . @xmath6 and the approximate hermitian overlap dirac operator is given by @xmath7 where the function @xmath8 is a numerically accurate rational approximation to the sign function @xmath9 for @xmath10 in the spectrum of @xmath3 .",
    "one can easily add an explicit dirac mass term for the field @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath0 has to fulfill additional requirements : it has to have a condition number that is not significantly worse than that of the five dimensional dirac operator used for domain wall fermions , @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , the condition number should not diverge as a function of the number of extra fields , @xmath2 .",
    "the cost of acting with @xmath0 should grow no more than linearly with @xmath12 , so long as the truncation of the sign function converges as @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 should depend structurally only on @xmath3 as one entity .",
    "a dependence on @xmath3 as one object ensures that if a better version of @xmath3 is eventually found , it would be trivial to change @xmath0 , replacing the old @xmath3 with the new one .",
    "also , the implementation of the projection technique simply involves a replacement of @xmath3 as a whole . in particular ,",
    "taking derivatives with respect to the gauge fields would be simple , making the computation of the `` force '' in hybrid monte carlo relatively easy .",
    "although the action for domain wall fermions also has a simple dependence on the gauge fields , the dependence on the length of the extra direction is controlled by the complicated transfer matrix @xmath14  @xcite . the dependence on @xmath12 is simpler in the overlap case , as it comes in only through @xmath15 , and @xmath3 is a sparse matrix , unlike @xmath14 .",
    "previous proposals for @xmath0 had some numerical entries that were large and grew with @xmath12 .",
    "this implied that the norm of @xmath0 , @xmath16 , grew and made the condition number @xmath17 grow too .",
    "our choice for matrix norms is quite standard : @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being the largest eigenvalue of @xmath20 .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to present a new version of @xmath0 which satisfies the above requirements and also has a reasonable condition number .    in the next section",
    "we shall construct @xmath0 .",
    "we proceed with the derivation of rigorous upper bounds on @xmath16 and on @xmath21 .",
    "rigorous bounds are nice , but there always is a question whether they are saturated .",
    "this will be discussed .",
    "we shall also ask the opposite question : what is the best one can hope for , regarding @xmath22 ? to answer that we shall derive a lower bound for @xmath21 .",
    "this is all we need because , in practice , we expect the upper bound on @xmath16 to be typically almost saturated .",
    "we proceed to address the question how our results compare to what is known about the domain wall fermion operator @xmath11 .",
    "since not much seems to be known , we derive some exact results for @xmath11 too , but also leave more work for the future .",
    "we then briefly discuss projection techniques for both overlap and domain wall fermions .",
    "we conclude the paper with a discussion of other advantages we envisage our proposal to have over domain wall fermions , beyond better chirality properties .",
    "we compare the number of @xmath3 operations needed to perform the inversion of the fermionic operator .",
    "we find this number numerically for three cases : domain wall fermions , a method using the operator @xmath0 proposed in this paper , and a method using a direct computation of the sign function represented by the same rational approximation as implemented by @xmath0 .",
    "the comparison is carried out for the two dimensional schwinger model .",
    "we hope to convince the reader that the overlap alternatives merit serious numerical testing in the context of qcd , something we are not fully geared up to do efficiently by ourselves .",
    "the kernels of the quadratic fermionic actions we shall work with will be hermitian matrices in most cases .",
    "let @xmath4 be the light dirac field representing a light quark .",
    "we wish to end up with an action @xmath23\\psi .\\ ] ] the bare quark mass @xmath24  @xcite is restricted by @xmath25 for physical reasons .",
    "the matrix @xmath3 has the standard wilson form , but can be easily replaced by a more elaborate construction .",
    "the function @xmath26 is an approximation to @xmath9 : @xmath27 with @xmath28 this rational approximation can be replaced by others : one can replace the @xmath29 and @xmath30 quantities with other real numbers of either sign ; to change the overall sign of a contribution at some @xmath31 one simply switches the sign of @xmath3 at that @xmath31 .    for each @xmath31 we introduce a new field @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath32 fields are decoupled from each other and enter quadratically in the action : @xmath33 \\chi_s .\\ ] ] in addition , they couple to the @xmath4 field by @xmath34 to get the right effective action for @xmath4 , there also is a quadratic term in @xmath4 : @xmath35    to make the action local we should eliminate the inverse of @xmath3 from the @xmath36-action . to this end",
    "we introduce @xmath12 more dirac fields , @xmath37 , also grassmann , and change the @xmath36 self interaction to : @xmath38    introduce the combined field @xmath39 .",
    "the action is @xmath40 with @xmath41    our new extended overlap model is based on the following identity : @xmath42 \\int d\\bar\\psi d\\psi e^{-\\bar\\psi \\left ( { { 1+\\mu}\\over 2 } \\gamma_5 + { { 1-\\mu}\\over { 2n}}\\sum_{s=1}^n { 1\\over { c_s^2 h_w + { { s_s^2}\\over h_w } } } \\right ) \\psi } \\ ] ] the prefactor can be canceled by adding pseudofermions , which will be decoupled in the @xmath31 index .",
    "at @xmath43 we can take a continuum limit , with @xmath44 the effective action then becomes : @xmath45 \\cr & + & { 2\\over\\pi } \\int d\\theta [ \\cos^2 \\theta   \\bar\\chi ( \\theta ) h_w \\chi ( \\theta ) -\\bar\\phi ( \\theta ) h_w \\phi ( \\theta ) + \\sin\\theta \\bar \\chi ( \\theta ) \\phi ( \\theta ) +   \\sin\\theta \\bar\\phi(\\theta ) \\chi(\\theta ) ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the following identity ( which holds as long as @xmath46 is finite ) expresses the essence of our construction : @xmath47 in terms of @xmath48 the action in the extra dimension involves no derivatives . in a rough sense",
    "the @xmath48 variable corresponds to a `` fifth '' momentum ( for a four dimensional physics application ) .",
    "the physical degrees of freedom , @xmath4 , couple only to an average field .",
    "these two features indicate that one might be able to use some sort of multi - grid or hierarchical techniques to reduce the @xmath49 computational cost per inversion of @xmath0 to a logarithmic dependence on @xmath12 .",
    "other integral representations of the sign function , or other approximation to the integrals above , will produce more variations on the same basic idea , but with possibly different computational properties .",
    "the strategy for finding bounds on the spectrum of @xmath0 is based on an exact formula for the determinant of @xmath50 .",
    "this determinant is obtained by adding @xmath51 to the action and doing the gaussian integral .",
    "@xmath52 \\right \\ } \\det \\left [ { { 1+\\mu}\\over 2}\\gamma_5 + z   + { { 1-\\mu}\\over 2 } f_n ( h_w , z ) \\right ] \\ ] ] here , @xmath53 eigenvalues of @xmath0 are roots of the equation @xmath54 .",
    "all the roots come from roots of the last factor .",
    "( roots of the factors in the product over @xmath31 are canceled by poles in the last factor .",
    "so , the spectrum of @xmath0 is determined by the last factor . )    introducing @xmath55 we see that @xmath56    @xmath57 is a ratio of polynomials in @xmath58 : @xmath59 extracting @xmath60 from numerator and denominator , we see that @xmath61 is also a ratio of polynomials in @xmath3 . for real @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "we can write simple closed formulae : if @xmath64 we have @xmath65 if @xmath66 , @xmath67 these formulae make the @xmath12-dependence explicit .",
    "the product @xmath68 clearly plays a central role : @xmath69    our bounds are based on the observation that for @xmath64 we have an @xmath12-independent bound : @xmath70 if we allowed @xmath66 , we would have had little control over @xmath57 because of the tangent function .",
    "for very large @xmath71 @xmath68 is large and positive , making @xmath72 large in absolute value .",
    "it is clear that @xmath73 can not vanish then . to find an upper bound for @xmath16 we look for the smallest @xmath71 values for which the above is still true , as we decrease @xmath71 from infinity .    * theorem i : * for any hermitian bounded @xmath3 we have @xmath74 * proof of theorem i : * pick a real number @xmath75 , @xmath76 we shall prove , by contradiction , that this implies @xmath77 .",
    "all we need to show is that the hermitian operator @xmath78 has no zero eigenvectors .",
    "we assume that there exists such a normalized eigenvector @xmath79 .",

    "hence , @xmath91 which implies @xmath92 in contradiction to our initial assumption about @xmath75 @xmath93    this establishes the upper bound of theorem i. note that it is @xmath24 and @xmath12 independent .",
    "* corollary : * let @xmath3 be the hermitian wilson dirac operator in even @xmath94 dimensions , and @xmath0 defined as above , with the standard replacement of the four dimensional @xmath95 . let the mass parameter @xmath96 in @xmath3 be restricted by @xmath97 . then @xmath98 this is a direct consequence of the known upper bound on @xmath99 @xmath93    we expect this bound to be quite close to optimal .",
    "this proves that the main difficulty faced by previous proposals to implement the overlap dirac operator by adding extra fields has been completely eliminated .",
    "the problem with the previous proposals was that one could not control @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , our bound is quite stringent numerically , even smaller than a typical bound on a wilson dirac operator in @xmath100 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "this is a plausible comparison , because one could thing about @xmath31 as indexing an extra dimension . at any rate , for @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    "one would have @xmath103 which is very reasonable .",
    "we ran some tests in two dimensions with @xmath104 and found the bound of @xmath105 to be typically almost saturated for @xmath106 gauge configurations generated with a wilson action at @xmath107 .",
    "moreover , with a trivial gauge background one can explicitly check that one can get quite close numerically to the upper bound and so it is impossible to find a gauge background independent bound which is significantly better .",
    "the immediate question we need to address now is what happens to the low eigenvalues of @xmath0 .",
    "having established that @xmath0 behaves more or less as a usual fermionic lattice operator at high eigenvalues , numerical problems can only come from a large @xmath21 .",
    "the basic strategy to get the bound is similar to the one used above .",
    "first take @xmath108 and @xmath43 .",

    "then , @xmath109 and @xmath110 . as a result",

    "the range @xmath118 covers all possible positive quark masses .",
    "the case @xmath119 describes quarks with a negative mass .",
    "this certainly is not without interest , but the analysis becomes more complicated and unnecessary for our purposes here .",
    "so , we simply restrict ourselves to the range @xmath120 .",
    "let @xmath82 be an eigenvalue of @xmath3 : @xmath121 we define @xmath122 as the smallest positive solution to the following equation : @xmath123 since @xmath124 , we have : @xmath125 @xmath82 is restricted to ranges that are symmetric about zero .",

    "a bound analytically is cumbersome because @xmath133 will be controlled by either an @xmath82 corresponding to a maximal ( in absolute magnitude ) eigenvalue of @xmath3 or to a minimal one .",
    "some analysis shows that there is a constant of order unity ( dependent on the dimension @xmath94 and the @xmath96 parameter in @xmath3 ) , @xmath134 , and that if we restrict @xmath3 by @xmath135 the minimum over @xmath82 we need in order to get @xmath132 is attained at @xmath136 thus , the entire dependence of @xmath132 on @xmath3 comes in through the value of the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath137 .",
    "gauge configurations for which @xmath138 are easily handled by any numerical method and the condition number in that case is not a source of concern .",
    "so , nothing is lost by assuming that the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath137 is smaller than @xmath139 ; this is anyhow the case for most gauge configurations one encounters in practical qcd simulations .    in order to get some feeling for orders of magnitude we work out a simple analytical approximation for the bound on @xmath71 and represent the exact result for the bound as the product of this approximation times a correction factor .",

    "the answer is that one can .",

    "however this will happen rarely .",
    "the most common low eigenstates of @xmath137 , which are the main source of difficulties in simulations , are typically non - degenerate and far from chiral ( as can be checked by computing the expectation value of @xmath95 , which would be @xmath184 for a chiral state ) . therefore , in simulations with typical parameters employed today , one does not expect to often realize the worst case .",
    "it is of course important to see how these analytic considerations apply to practical simulations . as a toy model we simulated 2-dimensional qed with gauge coupling @xmath185 on an @xmath186 lattice .",
    "the main factor governing convergence was the minimal eigenvalue in absolute value of @xmath0 .",

    "the difference is in the finite @xmath12 effects : they are larger here .",
    "this could be something that works in favor of domain wall fermions .",

    "one can also analyze trial states with some structure in @xmath31-space : @xmath222 the numerical coefficients @xmath223 are constrained by @xmath224 one can optimize the coefficients @xmath223 to attain a better bound .",
    "let us now argue why one can not use rigorous methods to get a worst case condition number for domain wall fermions that is better than the worst case condition number we obtained for overlap fermions implemented by using @xmath0 ( equation  ( [ cond_nr_ineq ] ) ) .",
    "as we learned in the previous section , the key point is that one can not rule out , for arbitrary gauge field backgrounds , the existence of an eigenstate of @xmath3 with eigenvalue @xmath82 which also is chiral and for which @xmath225 is very small .",
    "suppose we have such a state , call it @xmath79 .",

    "we choose : @xmath227    obviously , only a very special gauge background could accommodate a state like this , where , in addition , we want @xmath225 to be very small",

    "the action on the coefficients can be immediately read off as : @xmath230 \\pmatrix { c_1 \\cr c_2\\cr   \\vdots\\cr   c_{n-1}\\cr c_n\\cr}={\\tilde m}\\pmatrix { c_n \\cr c_{n-1}\\cr   \\vdots\\cr   c_2\\cr c_1\\cr}\\ ] ] here , @xmath231 the advantage of introducing @xmath232 is that it is hermitian and obeys @xmath233 [ 1+h - m ] ^\\dagger = { \\tilde m}^2\\ ] ] we need to find the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath232 for @xmath234 and to leading order in @xmath24 .",

    "the eigenstate associated with this eigenvalue has the following structure : @xmath237 ( because @xmath238 for a very small eigenvalue )  @xcite .",

    "the known upper bound @xmath244",
    "( in four dimensions , with @xmath245 ) , produces a bound similar to equation  ( [ cond_nr_ineq ] ) .",
    "one can not expect to get a rigorous upper bound on the condition number of the dirac operator employed for domain wall fermions that is superior to that obtained for the overlap implemented by @xmath0 .",
    "when comparing the overlap alternative to domain wall fermions one needs some criteria to relate the parameters in both models . in a real qcd simulation the criteria should be that the parameters be chosen so that similar physics is being described .",
    "this is not as unambiguous as it first sounds , but clearly beyond this paper .",
    "here we suggest the following set of criteria : we need to prescribe relations between the number of extra fields in each case , the parameters @xmath96 in the wilson dirac operator in each case and the mass parameters @xmath24 in each case .",
    "the easiest is to connect the integers @xmath12 in the two cases .",
    "this we do by requiring the error in realizing the sign function in both cases to be the same in the realistic case that @xmath137 has some small eigenvalues @xmath225 , of order @xmath246 or less .",
    "the error for domain wall fermions is of order @xmath247 the error in the alternative proposed in this paper is of order @xmath248 but the number of dirac fields in the domain wall case is @xmath249 while in the overlap alternative it is @xmath250 so , for practical values we should take : @xmath251 this ensures similar violations of chirality at @xmath252 for the gauge backgrounds where these violations are most significant .",
    "this match of the number of extra fields works in favor of the overlap alternative .    to match the parameters @xmath96 in both cases we focus on the problematic gauge backgrounds for which one would need very large numbers of extra fields to reproduce the sign function correctly ( or else , use projection techniques ) .",
    "we recall that if the parameter @xmath96 is the same in the domain wall and overlap contexts the logarithm of the transfer matrix of domain wall fermions and the hermitian wilson dirac operator of the overlap both acquire eigenvalues very close to zero in the same ( bad ) gauge configurations  @xcite .",
    "what is left is to match the parameters @xmath24 .",
    "this is more difficult to do in a gauge field independent way : let us adopt the criterion that we want the quark propagator masses to be the same in both cases , for the same gauge background , and infinite number of extra fields in both cases .",

    "denoting by @xmath253 the fourth root of the plaquette variable  @xcite , we find , in @xmath94 dimensions , the following `` mean - field improved '' estimates for the quark masses in each case :    for domain wall fermions , assuming @xmath254 , we get : @xmath255[2+m+d(1-u)]}\\over u } \\",

    "this might indicate an advantage to domain wall fermions , because the slow - down on inversion of @xmath0 or @xmath11 as a result of a small @xmath24 might be roughly the same for equal @xmath24 parameters . in our simulations of the schwinger model",
    "@xmath253 is closer to unity , @xmath263",
    "in practice , most of the numerical problems have to do with the presence of small eigenvalues to @xmath137 for typical gauge backgrounds . in the older applications of the overlap one used a projection method to deal with this difficulty .",
    "the projection method trivially extends to the overlap alternative presented here .",
    "suppose we have several low states @xmath264,@xmath265 with so small @xmath266 values that the needed @xmath12 s to handle these are too large .",
    "define the orthogonal set of projectors @xmath267 redefine @xmath3 in the overlap alternative by : @xmath268 this does not change the effective @xmath4 action at @xmath43 ; no new questions about locality appear as a result of this replacement .",
    "the replacement dramatically reduces the @xmath12 needed to get close to the @xmath155 chiral limit .",
    "the shifted states are now perfectly represented because for any @xmath12 we have @xmath269 .",
    "of course , calculating the @xmath270 s and acting with @xmath271 comes with a cost ; it is expected that the cost is bearable because the number of states one needed to project out was of the order of @xmath272 in practical simulations carried out so far in the quenched approximation using the rational approximation  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of projectors complicates the calculation of the force in hybrid monte carlo , but the complication is manageable  @xcite . under an infinitesimal change of the background gauge fields we have : @xmath273    we make a phase choice so that @xmath274 ( @xmath264 is normalized ; the phase choice eliminates the component of @xmath275 in the direction of @xmath264 and we ignore possible degeneracies for simplicity ) and then obtain @xmath276 the variation of the projector now follows from that of the state , and the phase choice we made no longer has any effect : @xmath277 the variation of the projectors enters the force always when acting on a vector . to obtain the resulting vector we need to compute the action of an inverse on a vector . if the overlap dirac operator is implemented by the rational method of ref  @xcite , the action of @xmath278 on the same vector for some constant @xmath279 has already been evaluated . using the shift trick of reference",
    "@xcite one can evaluate this new inversion at practically no additional cost in operations .    of course",
    ", if somebody comes up with a replacement of @xmath3 that has a larger gap around zero , it just plugs in simply into the overlap alternative .",
    "projection methods when generalized to domain wall fermions need to address the more complicated form the transfer matrix @xmath14 .",
    "but , if we are willing to depart somewhat from the clean structure we have seen above in the overlap case a natural suggestion is to replace @xmath3 by @xmath280 in the hermitian domain wall operator @xmath195 .",
    "we expect this to help because this would shift the small energy modes of @xmath3 elsewhere in the spectrum .",
    "this is not an exact procedure in terms of the transfer matrix @xmath14 , but the unit eigenstates of @xmath14 ( conjugated by @xmath95 ) are also zero eigenstates of @xmath3 . viewing the replacement as a perturbation , we see that the troublesome modes are the ones going to be most significantly affected . the main point in choosing an approximate projection",
    "is to avoid dealing with the nonlocal structure of the transfer matrix @xmath14 .",
    "numerical experience from early overlap days teaches us that dealing with @xmath14 directly is possible  @xcite , but it is also rewarding to deal with the sparse matrix @xmath3 instead .",
    "it would be interesting to check this suggestion out in practice .",
    "from the point of view of the projection technique the overlap alternative is certainly cleaner .",
    "but , if the proposal for domain wall fermions we just made works , we may still feel that the domain wall approach and the overlap approach ended up too close to a draw to make it worthwhile to investigate the overlap alternatives .",
    "let us now turn to what we feel are more clear advantages of the overlap alternatives .",
    "these advantages have to do with the simplified structure of the effective @xmath4 action and with the fact that the light fermion is so well identified . unlike for domain wall fermions , where the `` wave function '' for the light quark penetrates a sizable amount into the extra dimension , here the light fermion is fixed as @xmath4 .",
    "there is no better context to show how this would impact numerical qcd than to discuss chiral symmetry at @xmath155 :    let us introduce new @xmath281 fields so that the action now involves the non - hermitian overlap dirac operator @xmath282 : @xmath283 introduce yet another fermionic degree of freedom @xmath284 , but this time an auxiliary one : it has no kinetic energy . integrating out all the fermions but @xmath4 and @xmath284 leaves the following effective action : @xmath285 the matrix @xmath286 is given by @xmath287 and obeys : @xmath288 at @xmath43 , for an invertible @xmath3 , we see that @xmath289 is unitary and that the @xmath290 action is given by the overlap dirac operator , @xmath282 @xmath291 it is well known that @xmath292 is chiral  @xcite .    define the physical fermion field @xmath293 by @xmath294 this definition was chosen so that we get , at @xmath43 , the required subtraction of unity ( contributed by the @xmath284 propagator ) from the @xmath4 propagator .",
    "@xmath295 therefore , the effective action for the physical field is @xmath296 this effective action is chirally symmetric : the transformation @xmath297 leaves @xmath5 invariant on account of @xmath298 a continuum fermion operator with desired chiral properties is now simply transcribed to the lattice by replacing the continuum fermionic fields by @xmath293 .",
    "violations of chirality as a result of finite @xmath12 can be traced quite explicitly .",
    "perturbative calculations are an integral part of any procedure that connects numerical qcd to physics . in the overlap alternative",
    "one can restrict ones attention only to the @xmath4 fields ; there is no need to deal with higher dimensional propagators .",
    "one has an explicit , relatively simple action , and calculations , although still harder than in the wilson case , are tractable .",
    "indeed , there has been progress on perturbative calculations with overlap fermions recently  @xcite ( superficially , the treatment of chiral symmetry there may seem somewhat more involved then the one presented above , but it is essentially the same as here ) . as far as we know there are no finite @xmath12 calculations yet , but we expect them to be relatively manageable .",
    "the parallel calculations in the domain wall case are extremely cumbersome , see for example  @xcite . in particular , when one deals with questions related to chiral symmetry one seems to have to deal with the fermions in the five dimensional `` bulk ''  @xcite .",
    "this makes the finite @xmath12 effects in the domain wall context harder to estimate quantitatively .",
    "all in all , when working with domain wall fermions , one pays quite a price for having the two chirality components of the light fermion widely separated , and the entire set of extra fermions actively involved in the communication between them , be it because of finite @xmath12 effects or be it because of a topologically nontrivial gauge background .",
    "another factor to recall which is in favor of the overlap has to do with the parameter @xmath96 . in the overlap",
    "this parameter is theoretically restricted to the range @xmath299 . when the effects of the noisy gauge background are taken into account one",
    "gets effectively a positive additive contribution to @xmath96 ( in the mean field approximation it is @xmath300 ) which forces one towards the @xmath301 end of the range .",
    "still , one does not need to go beyond @xmath301 , so one is safe even for trivial gauge backgrounds . in the domain wall case one",
    "also is driven towards @xmath301 , but now there is some theoretical worry : for @xmath96 in the range @xmath302 the expression for the transfer matrix @xmath14 , while still a hermitian matrix , no longer stays positive definite for all gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "there are gauge backgrounds for which the matrix has negative eigenvalues .",
    "this raises some concerns about the true phase the lattice model is in .",
    "even only the proximity of a phase different from continuum qcd is a source of potentially large , undesirable , numerical effects .",
    "theoretically one would like to stay in the range @xmath303 for domain wall fermions , but this can not be achieved in qcd at present typical simulation parameters . in principle , one could get into this range , but the needed gauge couplings would have to be impractically weak .",
    "thus , the overlap alternative seems safer for the coarse lattices currently employed in numerical qcd .",
    "our specific overlap proposal is a very simple implementation of one rational approximation to the sign function . clearly , there are many variations possible and there is room for more improvement . in terms of flexibility , the overlap alternative of this paper is superior to the domain wall approach ; and more flexibility opens more possibilities to increase numerical efficiency .    up to this point",
    "our main conclusion is that the overlap approach based on the matrix @xmath0 is superior to the one based on domain wall fermions .",
    "of course , we can not rule out some surprises , so a numerical check in the context of qcd is necessary .",
    "going back to our main motivation , the reason to introduce @xmath0 in the first place was to have a more efficient implementation of the action of the rationally approximated overlap dirac operator .",
    "the original direct implementation used a two level nested conjugate gradient ( cg ) procedure and a mass - shift trick  @xcite which makes operation counts almost @xmath12-independent . in the inner",
    "cg the relevant condition number is that of @xmath3 and in the outer cg the relevant condition number is roughly @xmath304 .",
    "we see that our worst case bound for the condition number relevant to the single step cg for @xmath0 is roughly the product of the previous two condition numbers .",
    "thus , it seems that the new procedure is an order @xmath12 slower than the one it came to improve on .",
    "in addition , if one is willing to increase the operation count by a factor of @xmath305 in the old procedure , one can eliminate all the storage of the extra fields , providing a factor of @xmath12 saving in memory  @xcite ; in a computation limited by memory bandwidth rather than processor performance this version might turn out to be the best .",
    "it is important to mention that these considerations ignore the possibility of preconditioning the algorithm for inverting @xmath0 ; for example , the structure of @xmath0 readily admits standard red - black preconditioning .",
    "other preconditioning methods might exist , exploiting the rather smooth structure in @xmath31-space as evident from the continuum @xmath31-limit with no @xmath31-derivatives .",
    "moreover , the bounds on the condition number are not really saturated very often , and super - linear convergence effects in the cg procedure may change the dependence of the number of required iterations on the condition number away from the theoretical limit . still , it seems that for very large @xmath12 the older approach will eventually win .",
    "however , both the older and newer approach can be improved by projectors , and this will limit the size of @xmath12 one really needs . also , the mass - shift trick is incompatible with red - black preconditioning , so this might work in favor of the new approach .",
    "to get some feeling for what one would see in practice we again turn to two dimensional qed , with a simple plaquette wilson action at @xmath185 on an @xmath186 lattice .",
    "we performed the calculations necessary to obtain @xmath306 using either method and counted the number of @xmath3 operations required to reduce the norm of the residual to @xmath307 .",
    "we used @xmath151 but no preconditioning in the @xmath0-algorithm .",
    "we did use the mass - shift trick in the older algorithm . in neither method",
    "did we include projectors .",
    "this comparison ended up in favor of the older method by a factor of roughly 2.5 .",
    "this factor could be beaten by red - black preconditioning , but we have not tried this out .    the above direct comparison between the two overlap methods is easy because they should produce exactly the same results at the same @xmath12 and @xmath3 , gauge configuration by gauge configuration",
    ". essentially , these are just two different algorithms to do the same thing .",
    "a comparison to domain wall fermions is more difficult , because the differences at finite @xmath12 are more substantial and there is uncertainty about how to match the parameters . as far as operation counts go , one action of @xmath11 in the domain wall case counts roughly as @xmath308 @xmath3 actions .    a plot of the average number of operations of @xmath3 as a function of mass is shown for domain wall fermions , for the direct rational implementation and for the higher dimensional implementation of the overlap dirac operator in fig .",
    "the data was obtained from a sample of 20 configurations .",
    "the wilson mass parameter was set to @xmath309 in all cases .",
    "plotted on the vertical axis is the number of operations needed for a single inversion of the fermionic operator .",
    "for the overlap dirac operator simulations @xmath12 was set to @xmath272 .",
    "the plot also includes data for domain wall fermions , where @xmath12 was taken as @xmath310 , in accordance with equation ( [ ncomp ] ) .",
    "we used the same parameter @xmath24 also for domain wall fermions because the relation in eq .",
    "( 85 ) holds only for @xmath311 and becomes totally inadequate at @xmath312 .",
    "= 0.8    [ h_op ]",
    "let us summarize roughly the situation we were looking at when we began this paper : although an approach based on the overlap dirac operator looked theoretically cleaner , domain wall fermions were more attractive numerically .",
    "our analysis has led us to the conclusion that there is no evidence that domain wall fermions have even a numerical advantage .    in all cases we looked at ,",
    "one faces a problem related to almost zero modes of @xmath3 .",
    "this requires large numbers of extra fields in order to preserve chirality .",
    "it also affects adversely the condition numbers .",
    "whichever method we use , the worst case condition numbers are a product of the inverses of two main scale ratios : the first is the scale of the small eigenvalues of @xmath137 divided by an upper bound of the order of 5 - 10 in lattice units . the second scale ratio is the lattice physical quark mass squared divided by a number of order unity .",
    "each small scale ratio slows down inversion independently and the effect compounds in the worst case .",
    "thus , as far as we can see , at the numerical level , there are no _ a priori _ advantages to choosing domain wall fermions over overlap fermions in the context of qcd . in both formulations",
    "one faces similar numerical obstacles , and the overlap , to say the least , does not fare any worse than domain wall fermions . at the analytical level",
    "we are convinced that an approach based on the overlap ( or any other efficient replacement of the overlap dirac operator that might be found in the future ) is superior at presently attainable gauge couplings in numerical qcd .",
    "perturbation theory is more transparent to interpret and technically less complex in the overlap version .",
    "the chirality violating effects associated with the number of extra fields are much more explicit and therefore their impact should be easier to trace through .",
