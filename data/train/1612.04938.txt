    "constructing quantum theory of gravity is one of the major fundamental problems in physics .",
    "although we do not have such a fundamental theory yet , a number of thought experiments have been considered to grasp the essential picture of quantum gravity @xcite by qualitatively thinking of quantum gravitational effects .",
    "a common implication of these thought experiments seems that the classical picture of smooth and continuum spacetime may not be valid in quantum gravitational regime .",
    "this would indicate that spacetime should be described by a new quantum notion for successful construction of quantum gravity .",
    "in fact , a number of authors have proposed various models of quantum gravity based on discretized building blocks of spacetime in the planck scale . in these models ,",
    "a spacetime in the classical picture should emerge as an infrared collective phenomenon of the dynamics of such building blocks . whether this is achieved or not gives an objective criterion for screening models .",
    "the simplicial quantum gravity is one of such discretized approaches . in this approach ,",
    "a spacetime is modeled by glued simplices , and the random sum over them gives its quantization .",
    "the tensor models were originally introduced as analytic description of the simplicial quantum gravity in dimension @xmath0 @xcite simplicial quantum gravity .",
    "] , hoping to extend the success of the matrix models in @xmath1 .",
    "while these original tensor models are still remaining merely as sort of formal description , colored tensor models @xcite have produced a number of interesting analytical results in the large @xmath2 limit @xcite . among them",
    ", it has been shown that the simplicial spaces generated from the colored tensor models are dominated by branched polymers @xcite .",
    "since branched polymers have very different structures from our actual spacetime , further improvement would be necessary for tensor models to be qualified as quantum gravity .",
    "similar results have been obtained from the numerical analysis of the simplicial quantum gravity . in dynamical triangulation ( dt ) , the random sum over simplicial spaces is not dominated by the ones consistent with the classical picture of spacetime . on the other hand , the model with a causality , called causal dynamical triangulation ( cdt ) ,",
    "has been shown to produce macroscopic spacetimes , which are similar to the de sitter spacetime like our universe @xcite .",
    "the essential difference between dt and cdt is that , while the former basically concerns euclidean simplicial spaces , the latter incorporates causality to generate lorentzian simplicial spaces . here",
    ", the condition of causality prohibits the topology change of spatial slices of lorentzian simplicial spaces , which is the source of the difficulty in the euclidean case .",
    "the above success of cdt over dt suggests that causality would essentially be important for the emergence of classical spaces in formulating quantum gravity .",
    "causality can naturally be incorporated by using hamilton formalism .",
    "this motivated one of the present authors to construct a tensor model in hamilton formalism @xcite .",
    "a concern about the use of hamilton formalism for this purpose is that , if a time direction was introduced in an explicit manner , the dynamics of an emergent space , if it appeared , would not be described in a spacetime covariant manner , contradicting the central principle of general relativity .",
    "therefore , as in the adm formalism of general relativity @xcite , a time direction must be introduced as a sort of gauge direction : the hamiltonian of the model must be purely given by a linear combination of first - class constraints .",
    "remarkably , a tensor model can be formulated in this fashion @xcite , which we call canonical tensor model ( ctm ) , and moreover , under some physically reasonable assumptions , the model can be shown to be unique @xcite .",
    "in fact , ctm has various intriguing properties . as for its relation to general relativity",
    ", the following properties have been shown .",
    "( i ) in the simplest case , where @xmath2 denotes the range of tensor indices taking @xmath3 .",
    "] , ctm classically agrees with the mini - superspace approximation of general relativity @xcite .",
    "( ii ) in a formal continuum limit with @xmath4 , the algebraic structure of the constraints of ctm agrees with that of the adm formalism @xcite .",
    "( iii ) ( ii ) can be detailed further . in a derivative expansion up to the fourth order in the formal continuum limit ,",
    "the classical equation of motion of ctm agrees with that of a coupled system of general relativity and a scalar field in the hamilton - jacobi formalism @xcite . presently , we do not know whether ctm can successfully generate classical spaces as infrared phenomena of its dynamics , but the above results seem to imply that , if a classical space emerged from ctm , the dynamics in such a space would be described by a general relativistic system .",
    "another sort of intriguing results come from its connection to the randomly connected tensor networks ( rctn ) @xcite .",
    "rctn is a tensor network with random connections , and can describe statistical systems on random networks @xcite such as ising / potts models on random networks , etc . , by tuning tensors @xcite . in the infinite size limit of networks ,",
    "namely , in the thermodynamic limit , rctn shows critical phenomena , and it would be interesting to seek for a renormalization group procedure for rctn .",
    "interestingly , while it is not clear how to define coarse - graining procedures on such dynamical networks @xcite , one can find that the hamiltonian of ctm defines flows , which qualitatively agree with what renormalization group flows are supposed to be @xcite .",
    "an insight from rctn was also very useful in finding the exact physical wave functions of the quantized ctm @xcite .",
    "we would also like to comment that networks have appeared in some other approaches to spacetime @xcite-@xcite . in this respect",
    ", ctm describes spacetime in terms of networks rather than simplicial spaces , differently from the original motivation of the tensor models .",
    "the quantization of ctm is straightforward @xcite",
    ". the constraints of ctm remain first - class , even after quantization .",
    "an important physical question in the quantized case is to obtain the physical wave functions which are defined as the common kernel of the quantized constraints .",
    "the condition can be represented by a set of partial differential equations for a wave function .",
    "the first - class nature , namely , the algebraic closure of the constraints , secures the existence of solutions , but there are no apparent reasons for analytical solvability . nonetheless , quite remarkably",
    ", we have obtained various exact solutions with analytic expressions @xcite . as mentioned above , an insight from rctn was quite useful in finding some general series of exact solutions @xcite .        the main purpose of this paper is to present a new formulation of ctm .",
    "this is motivated from the aforementioned identification of a formal continuum limit of ctm with a general relativistic system in the hamilton - jacobi formalism @xcite .",
    "we want to obtain a tensor model which would be more directly related to a general relativistic system rather than that in the hamilton - jacobi formalism ( see figure  [ fig : scheme ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we will show that there actually exists a ",
    "mother \" ctm ( mctm ) which derives ctm through the hamilton - jacobi procedure",
    ".    we will also show the results of our initial study on the properties of mctm , while its continuum limit is left for future study .",
    "as we will see , there exists a crucial difference between mctm and ctm .",
    "while ctm has a closed algebra of two kinds of constraints , the closure of the constraints is not obvious in mctm : it is not clear what are the independent set of the secondary constraints and it may even be possible that there are infinite number of them .",
    "in such a situation , the existence of a nontrivial dynamical solution consistent with all the constraints is not guaranteed , as the restrictions imposed by constraints might be too tight . in this paper , we can not answer this question in general terms , but will show some concrete evidences for the non - triviality of the dynamics of mctm : we will obtain some exact physical wave functions in the quantum case , and also obtain some non - trivial phase - space solutions to the primary and all the ( possibly infinite ) secondary constraints in the classical case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", we give a brief review of ctm . in section  [ sec : new ] , we present mctm which leads to ctm through the hamilton - jacobi procedure . in section  [ sec : quantum ] and section",
    "[ sec : classical ] , we show some non - trivial solutions to all the constraints in the quantum and classical cases , respectively . in section  [ sec : network ] , we show that mctm is a natural extension of ctm from the perspective of tensor network dynamics .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] is devoted to a summary and an outlook .",
    "in this section , we will review the canonical tensor model ( ctm ) @xcite to make this paper self - contained and to fix the notations to be used .",
    "ctm is a hamiltonian system with a canonical conjugate pair of rank - three tensors and @xmath5 as the conjugate pair of variables , instead of @xmath6 and @xmath5 , which has been used in the previous papers",
    ". the familiar notation would be more appropriate , because the conjugate pair appears symmetrically in the new formulation .",
    "] , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 , which are assumed to be real and symmetric under index permuations .",
    "the fundamental poisson brackets are given by @xmath10 where the summation is over all the permutations of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , incorporating the symmetric nature of the tensors .",
    "the kinematical symmetry of ctm is assumed to be given by the invariance under the @xmath14 symmetry defined by @xmath15 where repeated indices are summed over and @xmath16 denotes the @xmath14 matrices .",
    "the transformation is consistent with the aforementioned properties of @xmath17 and @xmath5 , and pair - wise contractions of their indices are invariant under the transformation .",
    "as briefly explained in introduction , it is necessary to incorporate time as a gauge direction due to the restriction imposed by general covariance of the emergent spacetime .",
    "this is indeed realized in the hamilton formalism of general relativity , so called arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) formalism @xcite , in which the hamiltonian is purely given by a linear combination of first - class constraints .",
    "similarly in ctm , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are non - dynamical lagrange s multipliers , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the first - class constraints of ctm .",
    "we call @xmath23 and @xmath24 hamiltonian and momentum constraints , respectively , following the names used in the adm formalism . we may also call @xmath19 a lapse ( vector )",
    ". the constraints of ctm are given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a real constant . by rescaling @xmath17 and",
    "correspondingly @xmath5 to satisfy , one can arrange to have @xmath27 without any loss in generality .",
    "the classical equation of motion of ctm is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a time variable .",
    "these constraints satisfy the following first - class poisson algebra : @xmath30 + 2 \\lambda\\ ,   \\xi^1 \\wedge \\xi^2 \\right ) , \\\\ & \\ { \\mathcal{j } ( \\eta ) , \\mathcal{h } ( \\xi ) \\ }   = \\mathcal{h } ( \\eta \\xi ) , \\\\ & \\ { \\mathcal{j } ( \\eta^1 ) , \\mathcal{j } ( \\eta^2 ) \\ }   = \\mathcal{j } \\left ( [ \\eta^1 , \\eta^2 ] \\right ) ,   \\label{eq : ctmconstraintalgebra } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . in ( [ eq : ctmconstraintalgebra ] ) , the bracket @xmath34 $ ] denotes the matrix commutator , and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath24 serves as the generators of @xmath36 , infinitesimally representing the kinematical symmetry .",
    "an important property of this algebra is that there exists non - linearity on the righthand side of the first equation in due to the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath37 .",
    "this property is in parallel with that of the algebra in the adm formalism , where the poisson bracket of the hamiltonian constraints is dependent on the inverse metric tensor .",
    "in fact , the model , and hence the constraint algebra as well , are unique under the following assumptions @xcite : ( i ) the dynamical variables are a conjugate pair of real symmetric rank - three tensors , @xmath38 .",
    "( ii ) there is a constraint which has one index , @xmath21 .",
    "( iii ) there is a kinematical symmetry generated by the @xmath36 generators @xmath22 .",
    "( iv ) @xmath23 and @xmath24 form a first - class constraint poisson algebra .",
    "( v ) @xmath23 is invariant under the time reversal transformation , @xmath39 .",
    "( vi ) @xmath23 is at most cubic in the canonical variables .",
    "( vii ) a tensor - model analogue of locality is respected : there should be no disconnected terms in the constraint algebra : e.g. , @xmath40 is allowed but @xmath41 is not ( see figure  [ fig : connected ] . ) .",
    "the study so far has shown some remarkable connections between the classical framework of ctm and general relativity in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "firstly , for @xmath42 , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ctmhamiltonian ] ) agrees with that of a certain mini - superspace model of general relativity in arbitrary dimensions , if we consider the modulus of the tensor , @xmath43 , is proportional to the spatial volume in the mini - superspace model @xcite .",
    "secondly , in a formal continuum limit with @xmath44 , the poisson algebra ( [ eq : ctmconstraintalgebra ] ) coincides with the algebra of constraints in the adm formalism @xcite .",
    "in fact , this coincidence can be studied further , and it has been shown , through a derivative expansion of @xmath5 up to the fourth order , that the classical equation of motion of @xmath5 in ( [ eq : ctmeom ] ) in the formal continuum limit can be identified with that of a coupled system of general relativity and a scalar field in the hamilton - jacobi formalism @xcite .",
    "these successes concerning the connection between the classical ctm and general relativity gave us a good motivation to further investigate the model quantum mechanically as a model for quantum gravity .",
    "the quantization of ctm is straightforward .",
    "let us promote to the following fundamental commutation relations : @xmath45   = i \\sum_{\\sigma }   \\delta_{a\\sigma_d } \\delta_{b\\sigma_e } \\delta_{c\\sigma_f } ,   \\ \\    [ \\hq_{abc } , \\hq_{def } ] = [ \\hp_{abc } , \\hp_{def } ] = 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : commutator}\\ ] ] then , the quantized hamiltonian is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 there is a new term with a real constant @xmath48 , which comes from the normal - ordering of the first term of @xmath49 . by demanding the hermiticity of @xmath50 , the proportional constant is determined to be @xmath51 .",
    "a non - obvious convenient fact about the quantization is that the constraint algebra does not change from the classical case .",
    "namely , the constraints remain first - class , and the consistency of quantum ctm is guaranteed .",
    "in fact , from explicit computations , one obtains @xmath52 = i\\,\\hj \\left ( [ \\hat{\\xi^1 } , \\hat{\\xi^2 } ] + 2 \\lambda\\ , \\xi^1 \\wedge \\xi^2   \\right),\\\\ & [ \\hj ( \\eta ) , \\hh ( \\xi ) ] = i\\,\\hh \\left(\\eta \\xi \\right ) , \\\\ & [ \\hj ( \\eta^1 ) , \\hj ( \\eta^2 ) ] = i\\ , \\hj \\left ( [ \\eta^1,\\eta^2 ] \\right ) \\end{split } \\label{eq : qalg}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 with @xmath56-numbers @xmath57 . here , the ordering is assumed to be @xmath58 , when @xmath59 is an operator , as on the righthand side of the first line .",
    "a physical state @xmath60 of quantum ctm is defined by @xmath61 because of the closure of the algebra , no additional secondary constraints will be imposed on the physical states . since the number of the constraints is not larger than the dimension of the configuration space , there",
    "exist such physical states in general . by choosing a representation ,",
    "can be expressed as a set of partial differential equations , which generally have very complicated forms .",
    "nonetheless , various exact solutions have been found @xcite .",
    "presently , this analytical solvability seems mysterious .",
    "in this section , we will obtain a  mother \" ctm ( mctm ) which derives ctm through the hamilton - jacobi procedure .",
    "let us first recall the hamilton - jacobi formalism .",
    "let us consider a classical system with dynamical variables @xmath62 , where @xmath29 is a time variable .",
    "then , let us consider an action , @xmath63 where @xmath64 are assumed to be independent of @xmath29 .",
    "the conjugate momenta of @xmath65 are given by @xmath66 then , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath67    the hamilton - jacobi formalism replaces the problem of solving the equation of motion with solving a partial differential equation called hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "this is obtained by considering a canonical transformation with @xmath68 and putting into the hamiltonian : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is called hamilton s principal function and @xmath71 is a constant .",
    "when @xmath70 is obtained as a function of @xmath65 by solving , the trajectory of @xmath65 is determined from @xmath72 which has been obtained from and .",
    "this is a first - order differential equation in time of @xmath65 , while the equation of motion of @xmath65 derived from is second - order if it is expressed solely in @xmath65 .",
    "our main idea in this paper is to identify with the classical equation of motion of @xmath5 in , which is a first - order differential equation in time .",
    "a similar idea was used in the previous paper @xcite to show the agreement between ctm in a continuum limit and a gravitational system in the hamilton - jacobi formalism .",
    "the difference between the paper @xcite and the present one is that we will apply the idea directly to ctm without considering a continuum limit nor general relativity .",
    "namely , we want to find a ",
    "mother \" ctm ( mctm ) which derives ctm through the hamilton - jacobi procedure ( see figure  [ fig : scheme ] . ) .    in the present case , @xmath8 correspond to @xmath73 with @xmath74 corresponding to @xmath75 .",
    "then , one can easily find that @xmath76 reproduces the equation of motion of @xmath5 in , where we have included unimportant numerical coefficients into @xmath77 for simplicity of the expression .    from and",
    ", one can determine the potential @xmath78 as @xmath79 where we have set @xmath80 , because such a constant can not be expressed in a covariant manner proportional to @xmath19 or @xmath81 . here",
    ", the second term of @xmath16 in does not contribute to @xmath78 , because of the antisymmetry , @xmath82 ( see section  [ sec : review ] ) . by putting @xmath83 , , and into , one obtains @xmath84 note that , because of the antisymmetry of @xmath81 , the third term of is nothing but the @xmath36 generator @xmath85 , and therefore can be separated from the  hamiltonian \" constraint .",
    "the expression looks unusual due to the cubic term of @xmath5 , but can be made quadratic in @xmath5 by exchanging @xmath17 and @xmath5 .",
    "then , we can define the hamiltonian constraint of mctm to be @xmath86 where the parameters @xmath87 are real .",
    "the parameters take @xmath88 in , but this may be changed by real rescaling of @xmath89 . the relative minus sign between @xmath90 and @xmath91",
    "can not be changed by rescaling of @xmath89 , while the relative sign between @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be freely changed .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is invariant under the time - reversal transformation , @xmath39 , only when @xmath94 , which corresponds to @xmath95 in ctm .",
    "this restriction would be acceptable , because , as discussed in @xcite , the @xmath26 term causes a difficulty of violating the locality of the formal continuum limit .",
    "however , for the generality of the following discussions , we consider the general values of @xmath87 , not necessarily restricted by the correspondence to ctm .",
    "the quantization of @xmath96 can be performed by promoting @xmath89 to the quantized variables , @xmath97 , as in section  [ sec : review ] . to obtain a quantized hamiltonian , the normal ordering in the first term of",
    "must be fixed .",
    "normally , there are ambiguities , but , in the present case , the quantized hamiltonian is uniquely determined from the classical one by imposing the @xmath14 covariance and the hermiticity of the hamiltonian .",
    "firstly , one can always reorder the first term into the symmetric form @xmath98 , which is hermite .",
    "then , in this process of reordering , a number of terms of @xmath99 will be generated , but they must be collected into the covariant form @xmath100 , because of the requirement of the @xmath14 covariance . then , the hermiticity of the hamiltonian requires this term to vanish , and hence the quantized hamiltonian is uniquely determined to be @xmath101 where all the @xmath87 are real as in the classical case .",
    "the presence of the cubic term of @xmath17 in and makes it difficult to obtain the explicit solutions to the constraints , which will be studied in later sections .",
    "in fact , one can transform them so that the maximum orders of each @xmath17 and @xmath5 are quadratic , as follows . when the relative sign between @xmath90 and @xmath91 is minus , which corresponds to the ctm case , @xmath96 can be transformed to the form , @xmath102 with real @xmath103 , by an @xmath104 transformation , @xmath105 which keeps the fundamental poisson bracket .",
    "the details are given in appendix  [ app : trans1to2 ] .",
    "the quantization of @xmath106 can be done in a similar manner as @xmath107 .",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form similar to as @xmath108 where @xmath109 are real .",
    "the difference is the existence of the normal ordering terms as in of ctm , which appear as the imaginary parts of @xmath110 .",
    "the hermiticity condition determines @xmath111=-\\frac{1}{\\beta_2}\\hbox{im}[\\beta_4]=\\frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}. \\label{eq : imbeta}\\ ] ]    the expressions of @xmath106 and @xmath112 are very similar to those of ctm in and",
    ". actually , the only difference is the coexistence of the two cubic terms , and ctm can be obtained by taking one of @xmath113 or @xmath114 to zero , meaning the equivalence of the two options . ] .",
    "therefore , an advantage of the expressions of @xmath115 over @xmath116 is that one would be able to import some of the known results on ctm with appropriate modifications related to the additional term .",
    "in fact , in the following sections , we will discuss the solutions to the constraints and the relation with the network dynamics by using @xmath115 rather than @xmath116 .",
    "when the relative sign between @xmath90 and @xmath91 is positive , it is not possible to transform @xmath96 into the form of by an @xmath104 transformation ( see appendix  [ app : trans1to2 ] ) .",
    "however , in the quantized case , one can transform it to another form resembling @xmath112 : @xmath117 here , @xmath118 are creation - annihilation operators satisfying @xmath119=\\sum_{\\sigma } \\delta_{a\\sigma_d } \\delta_{b\\sigma_e}\\delta_{c\\sigma_f}$ ] .",
    "this rewriting is obvious , if one notices that the cubic part of @xmath96 has a form like @xmath120 , where @xmath121 has the form of the hamiltonian of coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "the hermiticity of @xmath122 requires @xmath123 .",
    "we may regard all the above three hamiltonians as the definitions of mctm in a loose sense . in a strict sense",
    ", ctm can only be derived through the hamilton - jacobi procedure from @xmath116 with @xmath124 , or @xmath125 .",
    "in the quantum case , an important problem is to obtain a physical state ( or a physical wave function ) , which must satisfy @xmath126 what is simple in the quantum case is that all the secondary constraints are automatically satisfied by @xmath60 , if is satisfied : @xmath127\\psi=0 , \\hbox { and so on.}\\ ] ] therefore , it is enough to solve .",
    "an important question is whether such physical states exist with non - trivial properties , or not .",

    "when @xmath135 is an integer , is not a correct expression of the general solution , but these cases can be treated by taking some appropriate limits of .",
    "the physical meaning of a wave function of a spacetime is not clear , in the sense that we can not yet give a probabilistic interpretation to it , as is possible in the context of usual quantum mechanics .",
    "currently we are lacking a clear intuitive understanding of it as we can not yet give a meaning to the norm and phase of the wave - function .",
    "we also do nt know the right set of boundary conditions that need to be imposed .",
    "this is partially because we lack a physical understanding of the wave - function .",
    "however , following the knowledge of usual quantum mechanics , it is interesting to investigate how the wave - function behaves when decaying boundary conditions at @xmath139 are imposed .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption which we adopt in this paper .",
    "then from the formula of the asymptotic behavior of the confluent geometric function ( see appendix  [ app : n=1wavefn ] ) , one can find that , if @xmath140 is satisfied , the asymptotically divergent part of the wave function vanishes , and the asymptotic behavior reduces to @xmath141 .",
    "to derive this , the explicit values of the imaginary parts of @xmath110 in with @xmath42 have been used .",
    "see appendix  [ app : n=1wavefn ] for more details . as an example , the wave function for @xmath142=\\hbox{re}[\\beta_4]=1 $ ] is plotted in figure  [ fig : waven=1 ] .    in the next ,",
    "let us consider solving the physical state condition , @xmath143 where @xmath122 is given in .",

    "the perturbation starts from @xmath160 , and @xmath161 with integer @xmath162 .",
    "similarly , the state can be shown to be normalizable .      in this subsection",
    ", we will give an exact solution to valid for general @xmath2 by using an insight from the randomly connected tensor network ( rctn ) .",
    "the insight was also greatly useful in our previous study of obtaining the exact physical wave functions of ctm @xcite .",
    "the generality of @xmath2 is remarkable , but , as we will see , there are two disadvantages compared to the @xmath42 solution obtained in section  [ sec : n=1 ] .",
    "one is that one of the parameters , @xmath163 or @xmath164 , must be taken to be a specific value .",
    "the other is that the expression of the solution still contains complex - valued integrations over @xmath2 variables .",
    "this makes it difficult to study even the qualitative properties of the solution .",
    "therefore , we will only check the non - triviality of the solution by taking special values of the parameters to make the expression simple enough .",
    "let us first recall some basics of rctn .",

    "<S> canonical tensor model ( ctm ) is a tensor model formulated in the hamilton formalism as a totally constrained system with first class constraints , the algebraic structure of which is very similar to that of the adm formalism of general relativity . it has recently been shown that a formal continuum limit of the classical equation of motion of ctm in a derivative expansion of the tensor up to the fourth derivatives agrees with that of a coupled system of general relativity and a scalar field in the hamilton - jacobi formalism . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the existence of a  mother \" tensor model which derives ctm through the hamilton - jacobi procedure , and we have successfully found such a  mother \" ctm ( mctm ) in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the quantization of mctm is straightforward as ctm . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have not been able to identify all the secondary constraints , and therefore the full structure of the model has been left for future study . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , we have found some exact physical wave functions and classical phase spaces which can be shown to solve the primary and all the ( possibly infinite ) secondary constraints in the quantum and classical cases , respectively , and have thereby proven the non - triviality of the model . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been shown that mctm has more interesting dynamics than ctm from the perspective of randomly connected tensor networks . </S>"
