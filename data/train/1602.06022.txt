    "because of the possibility of many exotic photonic phenomena , there has been much recent interest in metamaterials with almost zero dielectric permittivity @xmath0 and/or magnetic permeability @xmath1 [ 114 ] .",
    "these metamaterials have been termed epsilon - near - zero ( enz ) , mu - near - zero ( mnz ) , or epsilon - and - mu - near - zero ( emnz ) metamaterials .",
    "another area which has drawn much research interest is that of transition metamaterials , in which either @xmath0 or @xmath1 or both change continuously from positive to negative values [ 1521 ] .",
    "the common feature in both cases is the existence of the region where @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or both vanish and the strong enhancement of the electromagnetic ( em ) fields there . in the presence of an infinitesimally small amount of damping or gain in the resonance region , a large absorption or amplification of the em",
    "wave energy occurs .",
    "the strong enhancement of the em fields can also lead to enhanced nonlinear optical properties such as second harmonic generation and optical bistability @xcite .    in ref .",
    "15 , it has been pointed out that the strong absorption of the em wave energy in transition metamaterials with vanishingly small damping is due to the mode conversion of transverse em waves into longitudinal plasma oscillations .",
    "the derivation of the fact that em waves in ordinary isotropic media are transverse requires that @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not vanish anywhere .",
    "therefore , in inhomogeneous media where @xmath0 or @xmath1 vanishes in some region of space , longitudinal em waves can be excited .",
    "a representative example is the mode conversion of em waves into longitudinal plasma waves at the resonance points where @xmath0 vanishes in cold unmagnetized plasmas [ 2226 ] .",
    "the transfer of em wave energy to the resonance region associated with more general kinds of mode conversion occurring in magnetized plasmas plays a central role in a wide range of phenomena in plasma physics [ 2732 ] .    in this paper , we are interested in a novel kind of mode conversion occurring in isotropic chiral media .",
    "these media are characterized by a coupling between the electric and magnetic fields , the strength of which is denoted by a parameter @xmath4 termed chiral index @xcite . in the uniform case , right - circularly - polarized ( rcp ) and",
    "left - circularly - polarized ( lcp ) waves are the eigenmodes of propagation .",
    "the effective refractive indices associated with rcp and lcp waves are @xmath2 ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath6 ) respectively , where @xmath7 is the ordinary refractive index .",
    "the difference between them gives rise to circular birefringence phenomena .",
    "in isotropic chiral media with a non - uniform impedance distribution , rcp and lcp waves are no longer eigenmodes and are coupled to each other . in naturally occurring chiral media ,",
    "the value of @xmath4 is typically very small .",
    "recent rapid developments in metamaterials have made it possible to fabricate artificial chiral metamaterials , which show a greatly enhanced effect of chirality .",
    "many interesting phenomena , including giant optical activity , strong circular dichroism and chirality - induced negative refractive index , can occur in these metamaterials [ 3544 ] .    as direct analogies to enz , mnz , emnz and transition metamaterials , we consider uniform chiral slabs with near - zero @xmath2 or @xmath3 and chiral transition metamaterials , in which either @xmath2 or @xmath3 or both change from positive to negative values .",
    "we expect that the mode conversion of rcp or lcp waves or both into longitudinal modes and its inverse process occurs in these systems . in the presence of a vanishingly small amount of damping or gain in the resonance region , a large absorption or amplification of _",
    "circularly - polarized _ waves will occur . when the impedance is not uniform throughout the space , there occurs a complication due to the coupling between rcp and lcp waves .",
    "this interesting mode conversion phenomenon has never been studied before .",
    "we aim to explore this phenomenon by calculating the mode conversion coefficient , which measures the wave absorption or amplification , in a numerically exact manner using the invariant imbedding method [ 23 , 31 , 4548 ] .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we describe the invariant imbedding method used in this paper . in sec",
    ".  [ sec3 ] , we present the results of numerical calculations for uniform chiral slabs and chiral transition metamaterials . finally , in sec .",

    "in this section , we give a brief summary of the theoretical method used in the present study .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",

    "we assume that the medium is stratified along the @xmath9 direction and @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 are functions of @xmath9 only .",
    "the wave is assumed to propagate in the @xmath10 plane .",
    "then , using eq .",

    ". the waves are incident from the vacuum region where @xmath27 and transmitted to another vacuum region where @xmath28 .",
    "our main interest is in calculating the @xmath17 matrix reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which we consider as functions of @xmath25 .",

    "similar definitions are applied to @xmath43 and @xmath44 and to the transmission coefficients . for circularly - polarized incident waves ,",

    "if the imaginary parts of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are positive , resonant absorption occurs , whereas if they are negative , resonant amplification does .    in fig .  1 , we plot the absorptance , or the mode conversion coefficient , @xmath90 for rcp and lcp waves incident on a uniform slab of thickness @xmath25 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 versus the incident angle @xmath34 .",
    "we consider the four cases where @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which include both positive and negative index media .",

    "strong absorption for lcp waves occurs at very small incident angles when @xmath97 , while @xmath58 for rcp waves vanishes .",

    "we note that the maximum value of the mode conversion coefficient occurring at @xmath102 is very close to 0.5 .",
    "we have checked numerically that this maximum value remains the same for smaller values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 and larger values of @xmath96 .    in fig .  2 , we compare the results for the two slabs with @xmath103 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath104 . in both cases , @xmath7 is equal to @xmath4 and strong mode conversion occurs for lcp waves .",
    "the main difference between the two is that the impedance @xmath70 in the former case is equal to 1 , while that in the latter is equal to 0.5 . because the slabs are surrounded by a vacuum with @xmath105",
    ", @xmath70 is uniform throughout the space when @xmath103 . in this case ,",
    "rcp and lcp waves are completely decoupled and rcp waves can never cause mode conversion . on the other hand , when @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath104 , @xmath70 changes discontinuously at the interfaces of the slab .",
    "incident rcp waves can generate lcp waves at the interfaces , which can subsequently be mode - converted .",
    "therefore strong absorption or amplification occurs for both rcp and lcp waves in this case as shown in figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(d ) .",
    "since the coupling between rcp and lcp waves occurs only at the interfaces and is not very strong , the absolute value of @xmath58 is substantially smaller than that of @xmath59 .",

    "therefore , if @xmath122 , mode conversion occurs for both rcp and lcp waves .",
    "we note that @xmath70 is equal to 1 everywhere , and therefore rcp and lcp waves are independent . when @xmath4 is 0.8 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 vanish at @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively .",
    "lcp waves incident from the region where @xmath27 arrive at @xmath124 and are mode - converted there , while rcp waves have to propagate for much longer distances to @xmath123 before getting mode - converted .",
    "the increased reflection from the inhomogeneity experienced by rcp waves makes @xmath81 smaller than @xmath82 , especially at larger incident angles .    in fig .  4",
    ", we consider a nonuniform slab with a different configuration such that @xmath112 ( @xmath107 ) . in this case , @xmath2 never vanishes , while @xmath125 at @xmath126 . because the impedance is uniform and equal to 1 everywhere , rcp waves are unable to cause mode conversion and @xmath58 is identically zero .",

    "resonant absorption and amplification are substantially stronger for @xmath127 , especially at larger incident angles , than for @xmath113 , which is due to the fact that waves have to propagate for longer distances to reach the resonance plane experiencing further reflections in the case of @xmath113 .    finally , in fig .  5",
    ", we consider the configuration where @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "then the real parts of the refractive index and the impedance are given by @xmath128 and @xmath129 respectively . because the impedance is nonuniform , rcp and lcp waves are coupled to each other .",
    "similarly to the previous case , @xmath2 never vanishes and @xmath125 at @xmath130 .",
    "the inhomogeneity of @xmath70 causes a strong coupling between rcp and lcp waves , which results in a substantial amount of @xmath81 , as shown in fig .",
