    "general relativity in three spacetime dimensions is known to possess a number of special simplifying features : there are no gravitational waves , no black holes in the absence of a negative cosmological constant , the weyl curvature is identically zero , and the weak - field limit of the theory does not correspond to newtonian gravity in two space dimensions  @xcite - teit .",
    "the theory is therefore considerably smaller than general relativity spacetimes with four ( or more ) dimensions , and the strong - energy condition that creates geodesic focussing does not depend on the density of the material sources .",
    "these simplifying features mean that considerable progress can be made in the search for the general cosmological solution of the three - dimensional einstein equations . in an @xmath0-dimensional spacetime the number of independently arbitrary @xmath1-dimensional functions of the space coordinates that are needed to specify the cauchy data for the general cosmological problem on a spacelike hypersurface in vacuum is @xmath2 ; in the presence of a general ( non - comoving ) perfect fluid it is @xmath3 and for a comoving perfect fluid it is @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the @xmath5 case , we see that the number reduces to zero for the vacuum solution ( reflecting the absence of free gravitational fields in vacuum ) , reduces to one arbitrary spatial function in the comoving perfect - fluid case , and to three arbitrary spatial functions for a perfect fluid .",
    "in this paper we will set up the general cosmological problem in three - dimensional spacetimes and find the general solution of the field equations in the case of comoving pressure - free matter , with and without a cosmological constant , @xmath6 .",
    "we go on to find solutions for the case of non - comoving dust and classify the singularities and asymptotic behaviours that arise in both cases with and without a cosmological constant .",
    "the relative tractability of the general cosmological problem in 2 + 1 dimensions allows us to go some way towards finding a general solution of the einstein equations and we are able to isolate those features which prevent a full solution being found . in particular , we are able to find and classify the solutions for dust containing one of the ( two possible ) non - zero spatial 2-velocity components .    there have been several past investigations of the structure of 2 + 1 dimensional general relativity and studies of the properties of particular solutions with high symmetry ( see  @xcite-@xcite , and  @xcite - ida ) .",
    "important motivations for these studies were provided by the astrophysical interest in the possible observational signatures of cosmic strings and domain walls in the universe @xcite-@xcite .",
    "higher - order curvature contributions were discussed in  @xcite , together with the special features of the newtonian - relativistic correspondence in general relativity and related theories , while the study of quantum gravity is reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "cosmological solutions and singularities were discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite , while gravitational collapse of spherically symmetric dust clouds have been considered in  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we define the 3-d einstein equations and our notations .",
    "section 3 introduces the 2 + 1 covariant formalism and the general kinematics of 3-d spacetimes , identifying the special features that arise from the lower dimensions and from the vanishing of the weyl curvature .",
    "these include the key role of the isotropic pressure as the sole contributor to the gravitational mass of the system and the fact that vorticity never increases with time . in section 4",
    "we give a number of new cosmological solutions , review the characteristics of the homogeneous and isotropic models , including those that are singularity - free , and provide the generalisation of the gdel universe to 3 dimensions .",
    "we also consider linear perturbations around the 3-d analogues of the ` dust'-dominated frw models and find them to be ( neutrally ) stable .",
    "in section 5 we employ witten s first - order formalism  @xcite to formulate the equations governing the most general 3-d cosmological spacetime metric containing perfect - fluid matter .",
    "then , in section 6 we specialise the matter source to pressure - free dust with non - zero @xmath6 and comoving 2-velocities and find the general solution of the field equations .",
    "these fall into three classes , one of which generalises the solution of kriele  @xcite to @xmath7 , while another is the generalisation of the szekeres metric with nonzero @xmath6  to 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "section 7 considers the most general dust cosmologies with non - comoving velocities and finds various new classes of solutions .",
    "we study the asymptotic behaviour of these solutions and analyse in detail the structure of their spacelike and timelike singularities .",
    "also , by means of a number of examples , we illustrate the wide range of possible behaviours in the presence of vorticity and shear .",
    "the same section also introduces a transformation that generates exact solutions with nonzero cosmological constant from those with vanishing @xmath6 .",
    "finally , in section 8 we look at the case of a pure scalar field , provide the general solution of einstein s equations with one spacelike killing vector , and identify all the 2 + 1 pp - wave spacetimes .",
    "our results are summarised and discussed in section 9 .",
    "it has long been known that general relativity , as a theory of a riemannian spacetime , can be based on a small number of generally accepted postulates which are independent of the spacetime dimensions  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "assuming non - zero cosmological constant , these postulates demand that the field equations take the form @xmath8where @xmath9 is the ricci tensor , with @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the energy - momentum tensor of the matter generating the metric field @xmath12 , @xmath6 is the cosmological constant and @xmath13 is a dimensional coupling constant .",

    "the latter has six independent components , exactly as many as the associated ricci tensor .",
    "this means that the spacetime geometry can be expressed solely in terms of the ricci curvature , namely that  @xcite @xmath20as a result , the 3-dimensional weyl tensor vanishes identically and the gravitational field has no dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "the spacetime curvature is completely determined by the local matter distribution and the theory is machian .",
    "in analogy to the standard 3 + 1 covariant approach to general relativity introduced by ehlers @xcite and elaborated by ellis ( e.g.  see  eve for a recent review ) , we introduce a family of timelike ( fundamental ) observers with worldlines tangent to the 3-velocity field @xmath21 .",

    "the irreducible kinematical variables , which describe the motion of the above defined observers in a invariant way , are obtained by decomposing the covariant derivative of the 3-velocity .",

    "suppose that the matter that sources the 3-dimensional metric field is a perfect fluid .",
    "then , relative to an observer moving with 3-velocity @xmath21 , the energy - momentum tensor of the material component takes the form @xmath50where @xmath51 is the energy density , @xmath52 is pressure and its trace is @xmath53 . substituting the above into the einstein field equations ( efe2 )",

    "( [ crab ] ) agrees with symmetries of the riemann tensor in 2-d spaces ( e.g.  see  @xcite ) .",

    "( 55 ) of  @xcite ) @xmath81      the functional form of the ricci identity is independent of dimension .",
    "thus , when applied to the 3-velocity vector @xmath82 the ricci identity reads @xmath83where @xmath19 is the riemann tensor of the 3-d spacetime ( see expression ( [ riemann ] ) ) .",
    "contracting the above along @xmath84 , employing eqs .",
    "( riemann ) , ( [ efe3 ] ) , and then taking the trace of the resulting expression we obtain the 3-d analogue of raychaudhuri s equation @xmath85with @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the above is the key equation of gravitational attraction , as it monitors the average separation between neighbouring particle worldlines .",
    "the most important difference between ( [ ray ] ) and its 4-d counterpart ( see eq .",
    "( 29 ) in  @xcite ) is that here only the fluid pressure contributes to the gravitational mass of the medium : the density @xmath51 does not contribute .",
    "this unusual feature consists a major departure from standard gravity .",
    "one consequence is the existence of homogeneous and isotropic static 3-dimensional models with dust and zero cosmological constant ( see solution ( [ adust ] ) below )",
    ".    the symmetric and trace - free part of the contracted ricci identity , together with the auxiliary relations ( [ efe3 ] ) leads to the propagation formula for the shear in three dimensions : @xmath88relative to the 4-dimensional case ( see eq .",
    "( 30 ) in  @xcite ) , we notice the absence of the electric weyl component from the right - hand side of this formula .",
    "this reflects the vanishing of the free gravitational field in 3-d gravity .",
    "contracting this expression with @xmath71 we obtain the propagation formula for the shear magnitude @xmath89where @xmath90 by definition . in the absence of fluid accelerations the 2nd and 3rd terms on the right - hand side vanish and the equation integrates to give @xmath91 .",

    "therefore , the expansion decreases the vorticity of a 2-dimensional space unless the barotropic fluid has a stiff equation of state ( i.e.  when @xmath103 ) and for general perfect fluids we have @xmath104 .",
    "recall that , in standard general relativity , vorticity increases when @xmath105  @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous effects of shear and vorticity on a cosmology with negligible accelerations can be evaluated from these simple relations .",
    "for all equations of state we have @xmath91 but the centrifugal energy depends on the equation of state since @xmath106 .",
    "hence , the ratio of the distortion energy density to the centrifugal energy density is    @xmath107and the shear always dominates as @xmath108 when @xmath109 but the vorticity always dominates as @xmath110 .",
    "the presence of fluid acceleration can modify this behaviour ; an example with @xmath111 will be given below .",
    "spatial homogeneity and isotropy means that we can always choose a coordinate system such as the line element of the 3-dimensional spacetime takes the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) form @xmath112where the scale factor @xmath113 completely determines the time evolution of the model .",
    "the form also represents the metric of the 3-dimensional analogue of the familiar frw cosmologies .",

    "( [ kin]b ) leads to @xmath124where the product @xmath125 is proportional to the total mass of the model .",
    "therefore , the scale factor of a dust - dominated , 3-dimensional , frw universe evolves linearly with time , irrespective of its spatial curvature and no collapse to a final singularity occurs .",
    "note that when @xmath126 we obtain a static solution with @xmath127  gak .",
    "unlike its 4-d counterparts , this static universe has zero cosmological constant ( see also section 5 above ) .",
    "when the matter content is in the form of black - body radiation , the barotropic index is @xmath65 .",

    "one can study perturbations around the above given homogeneous and isotropic solutions by introducing the covariantly defined variables @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the former describes variations in the matter density and the latter in the area expansion as measured by a pair of neighbouring observers  @xcite .",
    "also , both variables vanish in the spatially homogeneous background and therefore satisfy the gauge - invariance criterion . in the case of a pressureless fluid ( i.e.  for @xmath134 ) the linear evolution of inhomogeneities",
    "is monitored by @xmath135on all scales .",
    "then , using solution ( [ adust ] ) and setting @xmath136 initially , we find that the density gradient decays as @xmath137with @xmath138 and @xmath139 ( see ( adust ) ) . for general initial conditions , on the other hand , it is straightforward to show that @xmath140 at late times .",
    "recalling that for zero pressure shear and vorticity perturbations decay in time ( see eqs .",
    "( sigmadot1 ) and ( [ omegadot ] ) ) , we conclude that in the absence of pressure the 3-d analogues of the frw cosmologies are either stable or neutrally stable .",
    "this behaviour is very different from that of conventional frw models , all of which are unstable to density perturbations , and reflects the fact that in three dimensions the gravitational mass of a pressure - free medium vanishes ( see eq .",
    "( [ ray ] ) ) and spherical regions of all curvatures asymptote to @xmath141 as @xmath142 .",
    "the immediate consequence is the absence of linear jeans - type instabilities in these models .",
    "the simplest 3-d line element describing a homogeneous and anisotropic spacetime has the following bianchi  i - type form @xmath143where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the two individual scale factors .",
    "when @xmath114 , the spatial flatness of the above metric means that the 3-d analogue of the bianchi  i universe is covariantly described by the following set of propagation equations @xmath146supplemented by the constraint @xmath147the above are obtained from eqs .",

    "the same also happens at late times , when the shear contribution to solution ( [ 2biadust ] ) becomes negligible .",
    "note that one can use the evolution law of the average scale factor to obtain those of the individual ones .",
    "assuming dust , recalling that @xmath152and using results ( [ 2biev]c ) and ( [ 2biadust ] ) we arrive at @xmath153 in the vacuum case ( @xmath154 ) the metric is just a coordinate transformation of flat spacetime rather than an anisotropic cosmology .",
    "consider a rotating three - dimensional spacetime with flat 2-d sections filled with pressureless matter .",

    "the matter density also scales as @xmath160 ( see ( [ rotev ] ) ) .",
    "one can also obtain a 3-d gdel - type universe .",
    "the gdel spacetime is a homogeneous spacetime and a rotating solution of einstein s equations which permits closed timelike curves  @xcite .",
    "covariantly , gdel s world is described by  @xcite @xmath161thus , with the exception of the vorticity , all the kinematical variables vanish identically .",
    "note that the overall homogeneity of the gdel spacetime guarantees that the vorticity is a covariantly constant quantity and that all the propagation equations reduce to constraints . applying ( godel ) to three dimensions",
    "we arrive at the system @xmath162which describes a 3-d gdel - type universe .",
    "note that for pressure - free matter the cosmological constant is necessarily negative ( i.e.  @xmath163 - see eq .",

    "the empty gdel - type model with @xmath164 is equivalent to anti - de sitter ( ads ) space .",

    "it was shown in rooman that all the non - empty gdel - type solutions considered contained closed - timelike curves but they vanish in the ads limit .",
    "the 3-d analogues of the standard singularity theorems are relatively straightforward to deduce .",
    "the study of the riemann and the ricci curvature shows that there are no weyl curvature singularities and the analogue of the strong - energy condition ( i.e.  @xmath167 ) reduces to the inequality @xmath168 for a perfect fluid and to the positivity of the sum of the principal pressures if they are anisotropic .",
    "also , the form of the raychaudhuri equation ( see ( [ ray ] ) ) guarantees that for geodesically moving observers @xmath169therefore , for vanishing cosmological constant and in the absence of rotation , an initially converging family of timelike worldlines will focus ( i.e.  @xmath170 ) . for non - zero vorticity ,",
    "however , this may not be necessarily the case .",
    "for example , applied to a spatially homogeneous and rotating spacetime filled with an isotropic radiation fluid , the above gives @xmath171therefore , as @xmath108 , the kinematical term dominates the matter term in the right - hand side of the raychaudhuri equation . in this case , whether caustics will form or not depends entirely on the balance between shear and rotation .",

    "although we have labelled the @xmath429 singularity as a ` big - bang ' it is important to note that it need not be everywhere spacelike , and different choices of @xmath667 and @xmath544 can easily result in it being timelike in some locality - that is appears spacelike in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is due to our suppression of the @xmath253-axis .",

    "we find similar pp - wave solutions by considering the 2 + 1 einstein - maxwell equations . up to gauge transformations , all the solutions are of the form @xmath716 , and @xmath717 for the electromagnetic potential , with @xmath708 arbitrary and @xmath718 as given above .",
    "the only non - vanishing components of @xmath719 are @xmath720",
    "whereas the general cosmological solutions of the 3 + 1 dimensional einstein equations are intractably complicated and likely dominated by non - integrability , the structure of the theory in 2 + 1 offers the possibility of making considerable progress towards finding the general solution in several interesting situations .",
    "this fact , together with our current perception that quantum field theory fits more naturally in three rather than four dimensions , has motivated the study of einstein s theory in 3-dimensional spacetimes .    in this article we employed covariant and first - order formalism techniques to study the properties of general relativity in three dimensions .",
    "the covariant approach provided an irreducible decomposition of the relativistic equations and allowed for a mathematically compact and physically transparent description of their properties . using this information we reviewed the kinematical , dynamical and geometrical features of 3-dimensional spacetimes and identified the special features that distinguish them from the standard 3 + 1 models .",
    "these include the key role of the isotropic pressure as the sole contributor to the gravitational mass of the system and the fact that vorticity never increases with time .",
    "we also reviewed the 3-d analogues of the spatially homogeneous and isotropic frw models and investigated their stability against linear perturbations .",
    "we found that , unlike their conventional counterparts , dust - dominated 3-d homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes are stable under shear and vorticity distortions and ( neutrally ) stable against disturbances in their density distribution .",
    "the latter reflects the vanishing of the total gravitational mass in 3-dimensional dust models , which ensures the absence of linear jeans - type instabilities .",
    "in addition to isotropic spacetimes , we also looked at 3-dimensional anisotropic models providing kasner - like solutions for the case of pressure - free matter and generalising gdel s universe to three dimensions .",
    "the covariant formalism allowed us to carry out these analyses by a study of the kinematic variables characterising the expansion of the universe .",
    "the absence of both electric and magnetic weyl curvature components in three dimensions considerably simplifies the analysis .",
    "we then specialised further to the case of a pressureless matter source .",
    "in addition to being physically realistic , this assumption produces a significant further simplification of the cosmological field equations in three - dimensional spacetimes .",
    "we were able to find the general cosmological solutions of the theory in the case where the matter was comoving .",
    "no symmetry assumptions were made .",
    "we then considered the fully general pressureless fluid system with non - comoving velocities .",
    "we were able to solve the system in the case where one spatial velocity component was zero whilst the other was non - zero .",
    "this allowed us to carry out an asymptotic study , close to and far from singularities , of an inhomogeneous cosmology with rotation , expansion and shear .",
    "all the singularities arising in these solutions were classified using the different criteria of strength introduced by krolak and tipler .",
    "we were able to provide a simple transformation which generalised all the solutions we found with vanishing cosmological constant into new solutions with non - zero cosmological constant .",
    "finally , we considered scalar - field metric with one killing vector and found all the pp - wave solutions in 2 + 1 dimensional universes .",
    "these investigations suggestion a number of problems for further study .",
    "exact solutions in the cases with non - zero isotropic and anisotropic pressure remain to be investigated . in the case of zero pressure",
