    "in this article we will construct families of complete embedded minimal hypersurfaces in the riemannian products @xmath3 , and also some examples of families of complete embedded hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature .",
    "the study of minimal hypersurfaces is a very classical problem in differential geometry and there is a large literature on construction of examples .",
    "the most studied cases are the minimal surfaces in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "let us mention for instance that h. b. lawson proved in @xcite that every compact orientable surface can be embedded as a minimal surface in @xmath4 .",
    "further constructions of minimal surfaces in the sphere were done by h. karcher , u. pinkall and i. sterling in @xcite and by n. kapouleas and s. d. yang in @xcite , among others .",
    "there are also plenty of constructions in other 3-manifolds , for instance recently f. torralbo in @xcite builded examples of minimal surfaces immersed in the berger spheres . and",
    "in the last few years there has been great interest in the study of minimal surfaces in 3-dimensional riemannian products : see for instance the articles by h. rosenberg @xcite , w.h .",
    "meeks and h. rosenberg @xcite and j. m. manzano , j. plehnert and f. torralbo @xcite . in higher dimensional manifolds constructions",
    "are also abundant .",
    "much work has been done considering minimal hypersurfaces which are invariant by large groups of isometries .",
    "very closely related to this work is the article by h. alencar @xcite where the author studies minimal hypersurfaces in @xmath6 invariant by the action of @xmath7 .",
    "the general case of @xmath8-invariant minimal hypesurfaces in @xmath9 was later treated by h. alencar , a. barros , o. palmas , j. g. reyes and w. santos in @xcite .",
    "they give a complete description of such minimal hypersurfaces when @xmath10 . of great interest for the present work is also the article by r. pedrosa and m. ritor @xcite where the authors study the isoperimetric problem in the riemannian products of @xmath11-dimensional simply connected spaces of constant curvature and circles .",
    "the isoperimetric regions in these spaces are known to exist ( see the articles by f. almgren @xcite and f. morgan @xcite ) and their boundaries are hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature which are invariant by the action of the orthogonal group acting on the space with constant curvature ( fixing a point ) . therefore in the study of the isoperimetric problem in such regions one is naturally led to study invariant hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature . a detailed study of such hypersurfaces , in particular minimal ones ,",
    "was carried out by r. pedrosa and m. ritor in their article . when studying minimal hypersurfaces invariant by the group actions as in the articles mentioned above one is essentially dealing with the solutions of an ordinary differential equation .",
    "the same is true for the case of hypersurfaces in @xmath0 which are invariant by the canonical action of @xmath2 , which is the situation we will study in the present article .",
    "the main technical difference when",
    "changing the circle for higher dimensional spheres is that in the first case due to the invariance of the problem by rotations of the circle the associated ordinary differential equation has a first integral , which helps to describe the solutions of it : this is not true when @xmath12 .",
    "the first and main goal of this article is to classify minimal hypersurfaces in @xmath0 invariant by the canonical action of @xmath2 .",
    "of course there is one canonical such minimal hypersuface given by the product of @xmath13 with a maximal hypersphere @xmath14 .",
    "the orbit space of the action of @xmath2 in @xmath0 is identified with @xmath15 $ ] . and an invariant hypersurface is described by a _ generating curve _ @xmath16 in the orbit space .",
    "the corresponding hypersurface has mean curvature @xmath17 if the curve @xmath18 satisfies    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is parametrized by arc length and @xmath21 ( and @xmath17 is taken with respect to the normal vector @xmath22 .",
    "we will describe the invariant minimal ( or constant mean curvature ) hypersurfaces by studying solutions to this equation with @xmath23 ( or a nonzero constant )",
    ".    we will give a complete description of invariant minimal hypersurfaces :    let @xmath1 and consider hypersurfaces in @xmath0 invariant by the action of @xmath2 .",
    "there is a one dimensional family of invariant minimal embeddings of @xmath24 parametrized by @xmath25 .",
    "there is a 2-dimensional family of invariant minimal immersions ( with self - intersections ) of @xmath26 parametrized by @xmath27 .",
    "there are two 1-dimensional families of invariant minimal embeddings of @xmath28 parametrized by @xmath29 ( each family is the reflection of the other around @xmath24 ) .",
    "these are all minimal hypersurfaces in @xmath0 invariant by the action .",
    "figure 1 shows examples of the corresponding generating curve for each of the three cases ( they correspond to the case @xmath30 ) .",
    "we will use similar techniques to show the existence of families of embedded constant mean curvature hypersurfaces invariant by the action of @xmath2 . in this case",
    "the situation is considerably more complicated and we will not give a complete description .",
    "one of the main reasons why one is interested in understanding invariant hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature is to compute the isoperimetric function of @xmath0 . by standard symmetrization arguments one can see that an isoperimetric region in @xmath0 can be of two types : either a product of the sphere with a ball in euclidean space or a ball type region invariant by the action of @xmath2 .",
    "the boundary of a region of the second type is an invariant hypersphere of constant mean curvature : the corresponding generating curve will start perpendicular to the @xmath31-axis and decrease until reaching the @xmath32-axis .",
    "we will then concentrate in hypersurfaces _ starting _ in the @xmath31-axis , since these are the ones that could give isoperimetric regions .",
    "there is of course a canonical example : if @xmath33 is defined by the equation @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the hypersphere of points at distance @xmath36 from the south pole @xmath37 then @xmath38 is an invariant hypersurface of constant mean curvature @xmath17 .",
    "we will prove :    for any @xmath39 there is a one - dimensional family of @xmath2-invariant embedded hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature @xmath17 in @xmath40 diffeomorphic to @xmath24 parametrized by @xmath41 where @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath43 then there is an embedding of @xmath44 with constant mean curvature @xmath17 , invariant by the action of @xmath2 .    the isoperimetric problem in @xmath0 can be solved .",
    "moreover it is known that for small values of the volume the corresponding isoperimetric region must be a ball : explicitly we will point out in lemma 5.2 that @xmath45 is unstable ( as a constant mean curvature hypersurface ) if @xmath46 ( by @xmath47 we denote the sphere of radius @xmath36 ) .",
    "for instance in the case of @xmath48 this says that isoperimetric regions of volume less than @xmath49 in @xmath50 are balls .",
    "therefore we know that for some ( large ) values of @xmath17 there are invariant hyperspheres like in the second part of the theorem . solving the equation",
    "numerically it seems that if for some value of @xmath17 there exists such hypersphere then it is unique and it _ divides _ generating curves like the ones in the theorem and generating curves with self - intersections .",
    "if one could prove that this is actually the case then one would have a good understanding of the isoperimetric profile of @xmath0 .",
    "this should be compared to the case of spherical cylinders @xmath51 treated by r. pedrosa in @xcite .    in figure 2",
    "we show three types of generating curves of hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature @xmath52 that appear for the case @xmath53 .",
    "there is a value @xmath54 such that the generating curve of the hypersurface of constant mean curvature @xmath17 starting at @xmath55 ends perpendicular at the @xmath32-axis , giving an embedded @xmath4 : the curves starting at @xmath56 produce embeddings of @xmath57 and the curves starting at @xmath58 produce immersions with self - intersections . in figure 3",
    "we still consider @xmath53 but @xmath59 .",
    "again there is a value @xmath60 such that the generating curve of the hypersurface of constant mean curvature @xmath17 starting at @xmath55 ends perpendicular at the @xmath32-axis , giving an embedded @xmath4 : the curves starting at @xmath56 produce embeddings of @xmath57 and the curves starting at @xmath58 produce immersions or embeddings of constant mean curvature hypersurfaces , but for which there is a point with @xmath61 ( and the corresponding hypersurface can not be the boundary of an isoperimetric region ) .",
    "finally we will discuss the stability of the noncompact constant mean curvature hypersurfaces discussed in the previous theorems .",
    "we will prove :    all minimal hypersurfaces in @xmath0 invariant by the action of @xmath2 and all the noncompact invariant constant mean curvature hypersurfaces constructed in theorem 1.2 are unstable .",
    "we consider a hypersurface @xmath62 invariant by the canonical action of @xmath2 ( fixing the south pole in @xmath63 and the origin in @xmath13 ) .",
    "the orbit space of this action is identified with @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "@xmath65 is identified with a curve @xmath18 in @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "parametrizing this curve by arc length ( and picking an orientation ) and writing @xmath67 , then @xmath68 , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the angle formed by the ( oriented ) curve and the @xmath32-axis at @xmath71 .",
    "the mean curvature @xmath17 of @xmath65 is of course invariant by the action of @xmath2 and so it can be expressed as a function of the parameter @xmath72 .",

    "it follows that one has a minimal immersion of @xmath253 with self - intersections .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem 1.1",
    "in this section we will show existence of some invariant constant mean curvature hypersurfaces by studying the solutions of equation ( 2 ) , with @xmath17 a positive constant .",
    "of course the equation is considerably more complicated than equation ( 8) .",
    "moreover the clear description obtained in theorem 1.1 will not be possible in this case .",
    "the first observation is that the isoperimetric problem in @xmath40 can be solved and it is easy to see by standard symmetrization arguments that the hypersurfaces which are the boundaries of the isoperimetric regions are @xmath2-invariant . and as usual they have constant mean curvature . for small values of the volume",
    "the corresponding isoperimetric region will be a ball bounded by constant mean curvature hypersurface which will be an @xmath2-invariant sphere .",
    "this will be given by a solution of equation ( 2 ) , for some value of @xmath17 , with @xmath321 and @xmath322 at some value @xmath323 .",
    "so we know that the situation will in general be different to what happened for the case of minimal hypersurfaces studied in the previous section .    as in section 2",
    "we let @xmath324 be the value such that @xmath325 .",
    "the constant function @xmath326 is of course a solution .",
    "consider solutions @xmath79 of equation ( 2 ) with initial conditions @xmath258 , @xmath259 .",
    "we write @xmath327 .",
    "let    @xmath328    then @xmath329 satisfies @xmath330 , @xmath331 and    @xmath332    the following is easy to check :    solutions of equation ( 9 ) are oscillating .",
    "( _ theorem 1.2 _ ) it follows from the previous lemma that for @xmath333 close enough to @xmath334 the corresponding solution @xmath335 of equation ( 2 ) must have a local minimum at a value @xmath336 .",
    "now we apply lemma 2.2 to show that there exists @xmath337 such that @xmath79 is increasing in @xmath338 and @xmath339 is a local maximum of @xmath79 .",
    "then by applying lemma 2.3 and lemma 2.2 we see that there exists a sequence of consecutive local maxima and minima @xmath340 such the sequence of local maxima @xmath341 is decreasing ( and bounded below by @xmath334 ) and the sequence of local minima @xmath342 is increasing ( and bounded above by @xmath334 ) .",
    "assume that one of the limits of these monotone sequences is not @xmath334 , for instance @xmath343 .",
    "if the maximal interval of definition of @xmath335 were a finite interval @xmath344 consider the solution @xmath345 of the equation    @xmath346    with initial conditions @xmath347 , @xmath348 .",

    "the for each @xmath351 for all @xmath352 big enough @xmath353 .",
    "this is of course a contradiction and therefore @xmath79 would be defined on @xmath354 .",
    "if the limit of both monotone sequences is @xmath334 and the maximal interval of definition of @xmath79 where a final interval @xmath344 then we would have that @xmath355 and @xmath356 : then @xmath79 must be the constant solution and we would again reach a contradiction .",
    "it follows that @xmath79 is defined for all @xmath357 and gives an embedded hypersurface of constant mean curvature @xmath17 .",
    "we have proved that there is an open interval containing @xmath334 such that for all @xmath333 in the interval @xmath335 determines an embedding of @xmath358 of constant mean curvature @xmath17 .",
    "now assume that @xmath359 and the corresponding solution @xmath335 does not determine such an embedding . then from the previous discussion",

    "it follows from lemma 3.1 that it can not happen that @xmath279 and @xmath363 . if @xmath364 then @xmath365 for @xmath32 close to @xmath284 .",
    "it follows that it exists @xmath366 and @xmath279 .",
    "then @xmath360 could be extended beyond @xmath284 , reaching a contradiction .",
    "then we can assume that @xmath367 . if @xmath279 and there is a sequence of points @xmath368 approaching @xmath284 where @xmath369 one can see from equation ( 2 ) that @xmath283 must stay bounded .",
    "then @xmath282 must also stay bounded and then it exists @xmath366 .",
    "this would imply again that @xmath335 could be extended beyond @xmath284 . and",
    "the same conclusion can be reached if @xmath282 has a constant sign close to @xmath284 .",
    "it follows that we must have that @xmath290 and therefore @xmath335 determines an embedding of @xmath358 of constant mean curvature @xmath17 .",
    "finally let @xmath370 and assume that for all @xmath371 , @xmath372 the corresponding solution @xmath373 determines an embedding of @xmath358 of constant mean curvature @xmath17 but this is not true for @xmath374 .",
    "then from the previous discussion follows that @xmath374 is a decreasing function in a maximal interval of definition @xmath361 .",
    "let @xmath375 .",
    "if @xmath376 then it is elementary to see that if @xmath377 then @xmath378 is bounded and so the limit @xmath289 exists and is finite .",
    "it then follows that the solution @xmath379 could be extended beyond @xmath284 .",
    "then we must have that @xmath380 .",
    "this corresponds to the situation when in equation ( 1 ) @xmath381 .",
    "but then one can for instance study the solution by considering equation ( 3 ) instead .",
    "the inverse function @xmath382 verifies @xmath383 and could be extended to an interval containing @xmath384 .",
    "it then follows that for values close to @xmath229 the corresponding solution of equation ( 1 ) has the same behavior .",
    "this contradicts that for every @xmath385 the solution @xmath373 decreases until reaching a local minimum .",
    "it follows that @xmath386 .",
    "consider the function    @xmath387    at a point @xmath131 at which @xmath294 we have that    @xmath388    then for @xmath131 close to @xmath284 we would have that @xmath389 .",
    "it follows that @xmath390 and @xmath282 where negative before @xmath131 and positive after @xmath131 .",
    "therefore @xmath282 must have a constant sign close to @xmath284 .",
    "then the limit @xmath391 exists .",
    "if @xmath392 is finite then it is clear from equation ( 2 ) that @xmath282 must be positive close to @xmath284 .",
    "then there there exist @xmath132 close to @xmath284 such that for @xmath393 we have @xmath394 . since @xmath392 is finite",
    "the speed at which @xmath79 reaches 0 is bounded .",
    "then the previous inequality would imply that @xmath283 must approach @xmath395 .",
    "then @xmath380 and so the solution @xmath379 determines an embedding of @xmath396 of constant mean curvature @xmath17 .",
    "we will now consider the stability of the constant mean curvature hypersurfaces described in the past sections .",
    "we will prove the instability of the @xmath2-invariant noncompact constant mean curvature hypersurfaces considered in theorem 1.1 and theorem 1.2 .",
    "the arguments for instability go along the lines of the ones given by pedrosa and ritor in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "it is said that the immersion of a hypersurface @xmath397 with constant mean curvature is stable , if and only if @xmath398 , for all differentiable functions @xmath399 , with compact support and such that @xmath400 ( see @xcite ) . with the index form @xmath401 given by      where @xmath403 is a unit vector normal to @xmath404 ,",

    "this is also written as                            there are two canonical examples of invariant hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature @xmath17 in @xmath0 : the product @xmath423 of a sphere of constant mean curvature @xmath17 in @xmath13 with @xmath63 and the product @xmath424 of @xmath13 and a hypersphere of mean curvature @xmath17 in @xmath63 . in terms of equation",
    "( 12 ) they are given by the constant solutions @xmath425 and @xmath426 , respectively .",
    "we will first consider these two cases :            then one chooses any @xmath433 with compact support and @xmath434 . then for each @xmath435 the function @xmath436 all have mean 0 and one can pick @xmath437 so that @xmath438 ( this is of course just the well known fact that the _ bottom of the spectrum _ of @xmath13 is 0 ) .",
    "thus , by recalling that @xmath447 for each @xmath448 with mean 0 , since the dimension @xmath449 is the first eigenvalue of ( the positive laplacian on ) @xmath450 , the instability condition reduces to @xmath451 .",
    "let @xmath452 be the solution of equation ( 12 ) that generates @xmath404 .",
    "we have seen in the previous sections that in all the cases considered @xmath404 is described by a curve which has at least one end which is given by the graph of a function @xmath79 satisfying equation ( 2 ) .",
    "we have seen that @xmath79 has a sequence of maxima and minima as @xmath453 .",
