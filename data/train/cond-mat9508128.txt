    "magnetic ordering phenomena of both classical and quantum antiferromagnets on non  bipartite lattices are a fascinating subject . the simplest and most frequently studied model of this type is the heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice ( haft ) . while the question of whether or not the typical features of this model have been observed in experiments is still a controversial issue @xcite , the theoretical understanding of these features has advanced rapidly during recent years @xcite . in contrast to antiferromagnets on bipartite lattices , the haft exhibits non  collinear magnetic order in its classical and most likely also in its quantum ground state . as a consequence",
    ", the order parameter of the haft is represented locally by a set of three mutually orthogonal unit vectors or , alternatively , by a rotation matrix which defines the local orientation of this set relative to some fixed frame of reference .",
    "renormalization group ( rg ) studies of appropriate nonlinear sigma ( nl@xmath6 ) models @xcite have revealed a number of interesting properties of the haft .",
    "the symmetry of the model was found to be dynamically enhanced from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , and in a two loop rg calculation for the classical haft @xcite , the temperature dependence of the correlation length @xmath0 was obtained as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the lattice constant , @xmath11 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath12 is left undetermined by the rg calculation .",
    "it follows from topological considerations that the order ",
    "parameter field of the haft allows for excitations of the form of @xmath13 vortices @xcite .",
    "a numerical study of the classical haft @xcite has revealed that these vortices become abundant above a threshold temperature @xmath14 and that they unbind for @xmath15 , similarly as the @xmath16 vortices in the planar @xmath17 model above the kosterlitz ",
    "thouless ( kt ) transition temperature @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "further evidence for this similarity beween the dissociation mechanism of the @xmath13 vortices and that of the @xmath16 vortices has been provided by kawamura and kikuchi @xcite . in recent work @xcite , we have studied the influence of the vortices on the partition function of the classical haft on the basis of the nl@xmath6 model . while a true kt ",
    "type phase ",
    "transition can be ruled out for the haft , our results suggest that for @xmath15 the vortices will affect the properties of the haft rather drastically . in particular , the disorder induced by the unbinding of the vortices can be expected to lead to a crossover from the t  dependence eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) of the correlation length in the low temperature regime @xmath19 to a kt  type behavior @xmath20 in the high temperature regime .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to supplement our recent analytical study @xcite , which was based on a continuum description of the haft by a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of the original lattice model .",
    "a similar study has recently been published by southern and young @xcite . while we closely follow the method of these authors , our conclusions will be quite different from theirs .    in the next section",
    ", we first give a brief account of the technique we used .",
    "subsequently we present the results for the correlation length @xmath0 and the antiferromagnetic susceptibility @xmath1 .",
    "while these quantities are directly accessible to simulations in the high temperature regime , where the disordering effect of the vortices limits the range of the correlations , the key quantity to be computed in the low temperature regime is the spin stiffness @xcite . our numerical results for this last quantity will be presented and discussed in section iii .",
    "finally , we summarize the evidence for a vortex induced crossover transition in section iv .",
    "the classsical hamiltonian of the triangular heisenberg antiferromagnet can be defined as @xmath21 here , the @xmath22 are three dimensional unit vectors and the sum extends over all distinct pairs of nearest neighbor sites of a triangular lattice of @xmath23 sites .",

    "then , the spins of each of these sublattices are updated sequentially . for a given spin",
    ", a new direction is chosen at random and the standard metropolis rule is used to decide whether the new direction is to be accepted . if it is discarded , a precessional motion through a randomly chosen angle about the direction of the local mean field is performed .",
    "we apply this method to systems of linear sizes @xmath33 . for the smaller systems , @xmath34 , we discard the first @xmath35 sweeps for equilibration and average over the next @xmath36 sweeps . for @xmath37 , we average over @xmath38 sweeps after discarding the initial @xmath39 sweeps , and for @xmath40 , the average is over @xmath41 , and @xmath36 sweeps are discarded .",
    "a selection of results for the correlation length @xmath0 and for the antiferromagnetic susceptibility @xmath1 which have been obtained by averaging over 3 - 5 independent runs of these lengths is tabulated in table [ tab_ksi_chi ] .",
    "as will become apparent shortly , the data shown in this table are crucial in checks of theoretical predictions for the temperature dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1",

    "we use the value @xmath61 , which we can be inferred from the temperature dependence of the spin stiffness as will be discussed in the next section .",

    "these lines are seen to fit the data quite well in the temperature interval @xmath72 , whereas the agreement between the curves representing the rg forms is restricted to a narrow interval around @xmath73 . in particular",
    ", we emphasize that for @xmath48 , the rg predictions are incompatible with the data points for @xmath0 and @xmath1 which are listed in table [ tab_ksi_chi ] with their respective errors . in this context",
    ", we recall that if our data for @xmath48 do not represent the thermodynamic limits of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , they are certainly lower bounds to these limits . hence , the discrepancy between the rg predictions and the true values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 may even be larger than has been inferred here .",
    "we note that the fit of the kt form , eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , to the data for the susceptibility @xmath1 is better than that of the rg form , eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , to @xmath0 .",
    "this may be attributable to the lower quality of the data for @xmath0 which are obtained indirectly from the ornstein - zernicke expression eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) in the limit @xmath74 .    in summary",
    ", we observe that our results combined with the earlier findings of kawamura and miyashita @xcite support the view that in the temperature range @xmath15 the spin correlations of the haft are decisively influenced by unbound vortices , so that a perturbative treatment of the model is inadequate in this temperature regime",
    ". it should be obvious , however , that in the above analysis of our numerical results we have been guided by our previous prediction @xcite that , in the case of the haft , the vortex unbinding mechnism leads to a kt - type temperature dependence of the correlation length above a crossover temperature @xmath75 . while we do not claim to have found compelling evidence for this prediction , we regard our numerical results as strong support for it .",
    "to further corroborate the above view and in order to get insight into the low temperature regime , where the correlation length exceeds the accessible system sizes , we also determined the spin stiffness @xmath2 in our simulations .",
    "the diagonal components @xmath76 , of the spin stiffness tensor are the second derivatives of the free energy density @xmath77 with respect to the twist angles @xmath78 of the spins around three mutually orthogonal axes @xmath79 @xcite , @xmath80        ( { \\bf u } \\cdot { \\bf e}_{ij})^2    > \\nonumber \\\\   & - & \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3 } t l^2 }   <   \\left [ \\sum_{<i , j > }            { \\bf s}_i \\times { \\bf s}_j \\cdot { \\bf e}_{\\alpha }             ( { \\bf u } \\cdot { \\bf e}_{ij } ) \\right]^2 >   \\;\\ ; . \\label{8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath81 is the lattice direction along which the twist is applied and @xmath82 is the direction of the bond between nearest neighbor lattice sites @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "( [ 8 ] ) has been chosen such that eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) is the stiffness per unit area .    in the simulation , the thermal averages on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) are replaced by averages over configurations which are generated by a large number of successive mc sweeps . for a finite system",
    ", the ordered spin structure will change its orientation in space in the course of the simulation . in a sufficiently large number of sweeps",
    ", one will therefore measure the average spin stiffness @xmath85    since there is no long range order in the haft for any finite temperature , @xmath2 must vanish for the haft in the thermodynamic limit for any finite temperature .",
    "however , for finite system sizes @xmath42 , @xmath2 will be finite for sufficiently low temperatures such that @xmath86 . according to eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , this condition should be satisfied for system sizes @xmath87 up to temperatures of the order of unity , unless the constant @xmath12 is exceedingly small as has been suggested by southern and young @xcite .",
    "as we have argued above , the results for @xmath88 in the high temperature regime , @xmath15 , should not be interpreted as evidence for such a small value of @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , a naive integration of the 2loop renormalization group equations which starts with the microscopic parameters of the haft as initial values yields the result eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath89 .    in our simulations ,",
    "we determine the three @xmath90 separately in each sweep and thus obtain the averages @xmath2 for each sweep . in fig .",
    "[ rho - t ] , we show the average spin stiffness as a function of the temperature for system sizes @xmath91 .",
    "the steep drop in @xmath2 which occurs as @xmath44 increases beyond @xmath5 is consistent with the rapid decrease of @xmath0 in the same temperature regime in which the vortices become unbound @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the spin stiffness of the planar xy model , @xmath2 does not saturate in the low temperature regime @xmath19 with increasing system size @xmath42 but decreases with increasing @xmath42 .",
    "this behavior is to be expected , since in contrast with the correlation length of the xy model , the correlation length of the haft remains finite for low temperatures , where the vortices are bound in pairs . as @xmath92 , our data for @xmath2 approach the correct limiting value @xmath93 .    in fig .",

    "we find that in the temperature regime under consideration , @xmath100 , the average stiffness @xmath2 varies linearly with @xmath101 to a very good approximation on the scale @xmath102 covered by our simulations , see fig .",

    "we have shown that the mc simulation of the haft yields compelling evidence for the influence of vortices on the spin correlations and hence on the thermodynamics of this model . in agreement with earlier findings by kawamura and miyashita @xcite",
    "we find that the disordering effect of the vortices sets in rather abruptly at a temperature @xmath5 . up to this temperature ,",
    "our data for the spin stiffness @xmath2 and the ensuing temperature dependence of the correlation length @xmath0 are consistent with the predictions of the rg analysis of the haft which ignores the existence of topological defects such as vortices . for @xmath15 , however , the simulation yields temperature dependences of the correlation length @xmath0 and the antiferromagnetic susceptibility @xmath1 which are incompatible with the rg predictions . instead ,",
    "in this temperature regime , the temperature dependences of @xmath0 and @xmath1 which follow from the kt picture of unbinding vortex pairs provide satisfactory fits of the data .",
    "a rapid increase of the density of unbound vortices for @xmath118 had already been found by kawamura and miyashita in their simulation of the haft @xcite .",
    "it had not been clear , however , whether this phenomenon would lead to the same temperature dependences of the correlations of the haft as had been predicted for the planar xy model by kosterlitz and thouless @xcite . in our recent analytical study @xcite ,",
    "we were led to the conclusion that this should indeed be the case .",
    "the present numerical study fully supports this conclusion . as we have discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the crossover transition from the rg type behavior to the kt type behavior of the correlations of the haft can not imply a phase transition in the proper sense , because the correlation length is finite both below and above the transition temperature @xmath75 .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
