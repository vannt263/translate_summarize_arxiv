    "wetting phenomena are very common in nature @xcite ; besides the most familiar situation of a liquid - vapor or of a binary fluid mixture in contact with a solid wall , wetting has also been studied , for instance , at grain boundaries @xcite , in polymer mixtures @xcite , alloys @xcite , superconductors @xcite and metallic vapors @xcite .",
    "usually one considers a semi - infinite geometry with a solid planar wall that preferentially adsorbs one of the phases of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "below @xmath7 , the bulk critical temperature , the adsorbed phase forms either isolated droplets or a thick macroscopic layer .",
    "the first case , known as _ partial _ wetting , occurs for temperatures below a temperature @xmath8 , the wetting temperature , while the second case occurs for @xmath9 and it is referred to as _ complete _ wetting .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the effect of wetting on the thermodynamics of a two - dimensional ising model confined in an @xmath0 geometry , with identical surface fields at the boundaries . if @xmath10 , i.e. in the bulk , phase coexistence occurs for temperatures @xmath11 and for vanishing bulk magnetic field @xmath12 .",
    "it is well known that the combined effect of surface fields and confinement shifts phase coexistence to a finite value of the bulk magnetic field @xmath13 , which for large @xmath2 scales as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the surface tension , the bulk spontaneous magnetization and the contact angle , respectively . equation ( [ kelvin ] ) is known in the literature as the kelvin equation and has a long history that dates back to the last century @xcite ; it essentially states that to have equilibrium between two phases , or phase coexistence , one needs a bulk field of the order of @xmath1 that compensates the effect of the surface fields .",

    "_ @xcite and parry and evans @xcite analyzed the next order correction term to the kelvin equation .",
    "both studies , using scaling and thermodynamics arguments , concluded that for temperatures below the wetting temperature @xmath8 , i.e. at partial wetting , the leading correction to scaling term is of type @xmath3 . in the case of complete wetting",
    "the correction is expected to be non - analytic due to a singularity of the surface free energy .",
    "for the two - dimensional ising model @xcite the predicted correction term is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "monte carlo simulations on @xmath18 lattices with @xmath19 were also performed @xcite ; the dominant @xmath1 scaling of the kelvin equation was well verified ( this was done also in three dimensions @xcite ) , but the data were not accurate enough to convincingly test the type of corrections to scaling .    we have studied this problem using density - matrix renormalization group @xcite ( dmrg ) techniques and we have calculated the bulk coexistence field @xmath20 for several values of surface fields and temperatures for strips of widths up to @xmath5 .",
    "our numerical data are in good agreement with corrections of type @xmath3 in the partially wet regime , but not compatible with @xmath4 corrections at complete wetting .",
    "we find instead that the correction to scaling at complete wetting is in good agreement , for a wide range of surface fields and temperatures , with a term of type @xmath6 .",
    "an explanation of this discrepancy is discussed in detail in the paper .",
    "the dmrg has been applied mostly to the study of ground state properties of quantum systems both in one @xcite and two dimensions @xcite .",
    "the method was originally developed by white @xcite for the diagonalization of quantum hamiltonians of very large systems using a truncated basis set .",
    "it does not have the minus sign problems that plague quantum monte carlo simulations of fermionic systems at low temperatures .",
    "nishino @xcite applied white s dmrg to two - dimensional classical systems , which are deeply related to quantum systems of one dimension less @xcite . in the classical case a transfer matrix of a large strip",
    "is generated by a series of iterations that , starting from a small strip , enlarge the system and truncate the configurational space very efficiently . although there are obviously no minus sign problems in the classical case the advantages of the dmrg with respect to the monte carlo method are mainly the high accuracy and the possibility of dealing with very large systems .",
    "untill now the method has been applied only exclusively to two - dimensional classical systems @xcite ; although extensions to three dimensions are possible , they will require a high computational effort and one should not expect the same high accuracy that is typically found in two dimensions .",
    "recently a series of classical models in a confined geometry have been investigated using dmrg techniques ; the studies focused on the effect of gravity on phase coexistence @xcite and on the critical point shift @xcite for a confined fluid , on the calculation of critical density profiles and casimir amplitudes for potts models @xcite and on studies of critical adsorption @xcite .",
    "another advantage of the dmrg for these types of models is that , being based on a transfer matrix approach , it naturally deals with geometries which are confined along one direction only and infinite in the other , i.e. with @xmath0 lattices .",
    "more details on the dmrg can be found in the broad existing literature ; a short review on the method has been presented in ref . .",

    "there is a good agreement with the slope @xmath100 of the dashed - dotted line , as expected on the basis of the scaling theory of albano _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and of parry and evans @xcite .",
    "it is also important to point out that for the full ising calculation at the same temperature and surface field we still find a slope @xmath97 , which suggests that the ising interface is closer to the wall than the sos interface for the same values of surface field and temperature .",
    "we have also calculated @xmath163 , the average thickness of the wetting layer , from the sos hamiltonian . for the sets ( c ) and",
    "( d ) and @xmath164 we found @xmath165 and @xmath166 respectively ( these values are expressed in terms of lattice units ) .",
    "notice that for a system of size @xmath164 one observes corrections to scaling of the type @xmath6 and @xmath4 in the sets ( c ) and ( d ) respectively and the large differencee in the values of @xmath163 is consistent with a crossover from a thin to a thick wetting layer discussed in the previous section .    0.2truecm",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the influence of wetting on the thermodynamics of an ising model in a confined geometry with equal surface fields at the boundaries .",
    "firstly , we verified with high numerical accuracy that the coexistence bulk field scales as @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the distance between the boundaries ) in agreement with the predictions of the kelvin equation .",
    "then our study focused on the higher order corrections to this equation which are expected to be analytic ( non - analytic ) at partial ( complete ) wetting .    using density - matrix renormalization techniques we found that for a large range of surface fields and temperature higher order corrections are not compatible with @xmath4 , which is the behavior predicted by the existing theory , but they are of type @xmath6 .",
    "we have shown that this apparent disagreement is due to the fact that even for the large sizes considered ( @xmath5 ) the wetting layer has a limited thickness , so that the singular part of the surface free energy which determines the correction - to - scaling behavior is dominated by the contacts with the walls . in this case",
    "a simple random walk argument indeed predicts a correction term of the type @xmath6 for a thin wetting layer . we have analyzed the problem also using a solid - on - solid model , which provides a simplified description of the wetting layer , but allows the study of much larger systems ( strips of widths up to @xmath160 were considered ) .",
    "the results of this analysis are consistent with the @xmath6 correction for small thicknesses of the wetting layer , but also show a crossover to a correction of type @xmath4 for sufficiently thick layers .",
