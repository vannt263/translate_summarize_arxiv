    "surveys of young open clusters and star - forming regions have identified hundreds of very faint members that appear to be brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "however , the mass estimates for these objects are dependent on the validity of theoretical evolutionary models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite ( hereafter c05 ) recently tested the accuracy of the masses derived from these models with observations of a low - mass companion to the young nearby star ab  dor . by combining their adaptive optics images of ab  dor  c and the astrometry of the primary from @xcite , they measured a mass of @xmath3  @xmath4",
    ". c05 found that the theoretical evolutionary models of @xcite overestimated the near - infrared ( ir ) fluxes of ab  dor  c by roughly one magnitude .",
    "they concluded that the use of these models to interpret photometry of young low - mass objects leads to masses that are underestimated by a factor of two and that many of the objects previously identified as brown dwarfs in star - forming regions and open clusters are instead low - mass stars .",
    "the age for ab  dor is important in this context because the comparison of the observed luminosity of ab  dor  c to theoretical models requires an assumed age .",
    "for instance , if ab  dor had an age of 100  myr instead of 50  myr as assumed by c05 , much of the discrepancy between model and observations would disappear .",
    "therefore , in this paper we reexamine the age of ab  dor .",
    "in adopting an age for the ab  dor system , c05 considered the apparent displacement of ab  dor above the main sequence , ab  dor s rapid rotation and high lithium abundance , and , in particular , its membership in a moving group @xcite .",
    "the age for this moving group was derived by @xcite from a comparison of its h@xmath5  emission strengths to those of the tucana group and from a comparison of its three m - type members to isochrones for 10  myr and the zero age main sequence ( zams ) in a diagram of m@xmath6 vs. @xmath7 , which indicated that the ab  dor group is older than tucana ( @xmath8  myr ) and younger than the zams for m stars .",
    "based on this analysis , @xcite reported an age of 50  myr for the ab  dor group .",
    "c05 subsequently adopted this age and assigned an uncertainty of @xmath9  myr .    in the following analysis ,",
    "we reexamine the isochronal age of the ab  dor moving group by including the m - type companion ab  dor  b ( rossiter  137b ) , which was not considered by @xcite and c05 , and by comparing the ab  dor group to the pleiades and ic  2391 open clusters .",
    "we then use modern astrometric data to investigate the previously proposed notion that ab  dor shares a common origin with the pleiades supercluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the evidence for a physical association between ab  dor  a and b is quite compelling .",
    "first , the trigonometric parallax of ab  dor from the very long baseline interferometer places it within 25  pc of the sun , and the spectroscopic parallax for ab  dor  b suggests it is also within about 25  pc of the sun if it has an age @xmath10  myr . based on the number density of stars in the solar neighborhood @xcite ,",
    "the probability of finding two stars within @xmath11 of each other and closer to the sun than 25 pc that are not physically associated with each other is @xmath12 .",
    "second , the proper motion of ab  dor is fairly large ( @xmath13 per year ) but the separation and position angle between ab  dor  a and b have remained sensibly constant for 80 years .",
    "the radial velocities of the two stars also agree to within the measurement errors of a few km  s@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "third , both stars are demonstrably very young based on their spectroscopic , radio , and x - ray characteristics @xcite . taken together ,",
    "the likelihood that these two stars are unrelated is extremely small .",
    "therefore , nominally one should be able to obtain a better isochronal age estimate for the ab  dor system from ab  dor  b than from ab  dor itself , because the displacement above the zams is larger at lower masses for a given pre - main - sequence age .",
    "the most direct , least model - dependent way to infer an isochronal age for the members of the ab  dor moving group is via a comparison to empirical isochrones defined by well - observed open clusters . for this comparison ,",
    "we select the pleiades and ic  2391 , which have ages of 125 and 50  myr , respectively , according to analysis of their li depletion boundaries @xcite . somewhat younger ages of 100 and 35  myr have been derived from their upper main sequence turnoffs @xcite .",
    "we compiled a list of members of the pleiades from @xcite and @xcite and a list of members of ic  2391 from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "for these members , we adopt the @xmath15 measurements from those studies and data at @xmath16 from 2mass .",
    "the well - documented error in the hipparcos distance to the pleiades indicates that for clusters beyond 100  pc , accurate main - sequence distances are preferred over hipparcos measurements @xcite .",
    "thus , we adopt distances of 133 and 154  pc and extinctions of @xmath17 and 0.03 for the pleiades and ic  2391 , respectively @xcite .    for the ab",
    "dor moving group , we consider the members identified by @xcite as well as the components of the ab  dor multiple system .",
    "we adopt the distances for these stars from @xcite , except for the two stars that lack hipparcos measurements , which are excluded .",
    "we use the johnson @xmath15 data compiled by @xcite for all stars except ab  dor  a and b , for which we take @xmath15 from @xcite .",
    "measurements at @xmath16 are adopted from 2mass for all stars .",
    "using the internal 2mass database , d. kirkpatrick kindly checked the accuracy of the 2mass data for ab  dor  a and b , which are separated by @xmath18 .",
    "he found that the two stars are well - resolved in the short  read 1 \" exposures and that the photometric measurements from two separate observations agree within a few percent for both stars .",
    "ab  dor  b itself is a close binary ( c05 ) . we have estimated the individual @xmath15 and @xmath16 magnitudes of the components by combining the measured flux ratio at @xmath16 ( c05 ) , the unresolved photometry , an assumption of coevality , and the relation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 implied by the empirical isochrone in the form of the pleiades sequence . the uncertainties in the distance , combined photometry , and flux ratio for ab  dor  ba and bb produce one sigma errors of @xmath21 and @xmath22  mag in their individual values of @xmath7 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the data for the pleiades and ic  2391 open clusters and the ab  dor moving group are plotted together in a diagram of m@xmath23 versus @xmath7 in figure  [ fig : vk ] .",
    "we find that the k and m - type members of the ab  dor group on average fall well below the sequence of ic  2391 .",
    "these data clearly demonstrate that the ab  dor moving group is older than ic  2391 ( @xmath1 - 50  myr ) . meanwhile , the sequence for the ab  dor group closely matches that of the pleiades . to quantitatively compare these sequences ,",
    "we have measured the offset in @xmath24 between the observed position of each star and a fit to the lower envelope of the pleiades sequence and have generated a histogram of these offsets for each population .",
    "we consider only stars at @xmath25 - 5.5 because bluer stars have very small displacements above the zams for the ages in question and redder stars are not present in the known membership of the ab  dor group .",
    "a visual comparison of these histograms in figure  [ fig : dm ] indicates an offset of 0 - 0.1  mag between the ab  dor group and the pleiades , which suggests that ab  dor is coeval with the pleiades or slightly younger .",
    "an offset of 0.1  mag for the ab  dor group would correspond to an age of 90 - 100  myr if we use an age of 100 - 125  myr for the pleiades and the differential luminosities predicted by @xcite .",
    "however , the mean offsets of the pleiades and ab  dor sequences are indistinguishable , with @xmath26 and 0.35  mag , respectively . in addition , ab  dor  ba and bb are clearly not younger than the pleiades , and these stars should be given the greatest weighting in this exercise given that they are much more directly and unambiguously associated with ab  dor than the moving group members and that they are better age indicators on a color - magnitude diagram than earlier type stars .",
    "the use of photometry in other bands and colors , such as @xmath15 and @xmath27 , produces the same position of ab  dor  ba and bb relative to the pleiades .",
    "note that c05 reported that ab  dor  c is overluminous relative to the pleiades ; this apparent discrepancy is resolved by a forthcoming analysis of the spectral classification of ab  dor  c ( k. l. luhman et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    as for ab  dor itself",
    ", previous studies appear to rule out binarity as an explanation for its overluminous nature relative to the pleiades , but its extremely rapid rotation is a plausible cause .",
    "such effects on the h - r diagram have been predicted from evolutionary models of solar - type stars @xcite , although they have not been obvious in observations to date @xcite .",
    "we also note that at least one solar - type member of the pleiades , hz  102 , is like ab  dor  a in that its overluminous position on the color - magnitude diagram appears not to be due to binarity .",
    "thus , strictly from an empirical point of view , ab  dor appears to be consistent with the pleiades on a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the li equivalent width and v  sin  i of ab  dor are similar to the values observed for rapidly rotating k dwarfs in the pleiades @xcite ( as well as in ic  2391 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the h@xmath5 emission strengths for the m - type members of the ab  dor group @xcite are indistinguishable from measurements in the pleiades @xcite , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : ha ] thus , these age diagnostics are consistent with the coevality of the ab  dor group and the pleiades that is suggested by the color - magnitude diagram . based on the above considerations , a conservative age range for the ab  dor multiple system and moving group is 75 - 150  myr .",
    "to calculate the galactic space motion of ab  dor , we use the equations from @xcite , the weighted mean radial velocity from studies which measured the quantity multiple times ( + @xmath28 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the long - baseline proper motion from the tycho-2 catalog @xcite , and the weighted mean of the hipparcos and tycho-1 trigonometric parallaxes @xcite .",
    "we derive a heliocentric galactic space motion vector for ab  dor of ( @xmath29 ) = ( -7.7 , -26.0 , -13.6)@xmath30 ( 0.4 , 0.4 , 0.3 )  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "for comparison , we calculated a velocity vector for the pleiades using the new distance estimate from @xcite and the proper motion , radial velocity , and mean cluster position from @xcite , arriving at ( @xmath29 ) = ( -6.6 , -27.6 , -14.5)@xmath30(0.4 , 0.3 , 0.3 )  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "an immediate result of this analysis is that ab  dor is only @xmath312 km  s@xmath14 from the pleiades in velocity space .",
    "but how close is ab  dor to the pleiades space motion compared to stars in the field ?",
    "for a field sample , we use the 13,222 stars with calculated uvw velocity vectors from the magnitude - limited sample of f / g - type stars from @xcite .",
    "ab  dor is the fourth closest star to the pleiades in terms of velocity using the vector from @xcite ( it is present in the sample despite its k spectral type ) , while it is the eighth closest star according to our revised vector .",
    "many of the ab  dor group stars from @xcite are in the sample from @xcite , and are among the @xmath32 closest stars to the pleiades mean motion .",
    "these stars include hd  45270 , hd  19183 , pw  and , and uy  pic . out of the 40 stars closest to the pleiades vector from the nordstrom catalog , 13",
    "are listed as members of the ab  dor moving group by @xcite .",
    "hence , ab  dor and its moving group members are in rather exclusive company among the @xmath310.3% of stars in the nordstrom catalog that are nearest the pleiades velocity vector .",
    "kinematic analysis of the hipparcos catalog @xcite has shown that many young baf - type stars have motions clustered near that of the pleiades cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has been referred to as the local association or the pleiades supercluster @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that ab  dor might belong to the pleiades supercluster , while more recently @xcite has proposed the existence of a moving group with ab  dor .",
    "@xcite reasoned that the more negative v ( @xmath33  km  s@xmath14 ) and w ( @xmath34  km  s@xmath14 ) velocity component of the ab  dor group makes it distinctive from other recently discovered young stellar groups within 100  pc of the sun , but ab  dor s velocity is directly coincident with the pleiades , as we have shown .",
    "very young open clusters are often found to be surrounded by unbound ob associations @xcite , a situation observed today with the @xmath5 persei cluster @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the systems identified by @xcite as members of a moving group with ab  dor are probably the remnants of unbound ob and t associations associated with the star - formation event that formed the bound pleiades open cluster .",
    "we now use our new estimate of the age of ab  dor in testing the theoretical evolutionary models of @xcite .",
    "c05 tested these models by comparing the observed and predicted values of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath24 , and @xmath37 for ab  dor  c. however , the predicted near - ir magnitudes are subject to known deficiencies in the opacities used in the synthetic spectra . indeed , discrepancies between observed and synthetic colors and magnitudes at near - ir wavelengths have been noted in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead , the most fundamental and robust parameter predicted by any set of models is the bolometric luminosity .",
    "in addition , the masses of young low - mass objects are typically inferred from the predicted luminosities rather than near - ir magnitudes .",
    "therefore , we consider this parameter in the following discussion .",
    "to test the predicted luminosity for ab  dor  c , we use the diagrams of luminosity versus age in figure  [ fig : lbol ] .",
    "we show the luminosity of @xmath38  @xmath39 derived by c05 with the estimates of age for ab  dor c from c05 and from this work .",
    "although c05 reported a significant difference between the observed and predicted near - ir fluxes for ab  dor  c ( primarily @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , figure  [ fig : lbol ] demonstrates that the predicted bolometric luminosity is actually consistent with their measured value within the uncertainties .",
    "meanwhile , using our estimate of the age of ab  dor  c , the data and model predictions agree reasonably well .",
    "the claim by c05 that the masses of young low mass stars and brown dwarfs are significantly underestimated using the models of @xcite hinged on the assumed age for ab  dor  c ( as well as its other stellar properties ) . because our best estimate for the age of the ab dor system is twice as old as they assumed ,",
    "we find no significant discrepancy with the model predictions when using bolometric luminosity as the mass indicator .",
    "we are grateful to davy kirkpatrick for examining the 2mass photometry for ab  dor  b. we also thank sandy leggett and laird close for their comments on the manuscript .",
