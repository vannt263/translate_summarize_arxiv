    "the antiferromagnetic ising model on the triangular lattice is of long - standing interest since it provides a canonical example of geometric frustration : it is topologically impossible to simultaneously minimize the interaction energies of all three edges of an elementary triangular face .",
    "recall that the ising model on finite graph @xmath2 is defined by the measure @xmath3 where the hamiltonian , @xmath4 , for the zero - field nearest - neighbor ising model is simply @xmath5 the coupling @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) corresponds to a ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) interaction .",
    "we say an edge @xmath8 is _ satisfied _ if the ising interaction energy of its two endpoints , @xmath9 , is minimized .",
    "an edge is therefore satisfied if its endpoints have parallel ( anti - parallel ) ising spins in the ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) case .",
    "it is clear that a given elementary face of the triangular lattice can have at most two satisfied edges in an antiferromagnetic ising model .",
    "the zero - field triangular - lattice antiferromagnetic ising model has an exponentially large number of ground state degeneracies , leading to non - vanishing entropy per spin  @xcite .",
    "although the model is disordered at all finite temperatures , at zero temperature the two - point correlation function decays algebraically  @xcite , and so the model has a zero - temperature critical point . by generalizing ( [ ising hamiltonian ] ) to include anisotropic couplings , dilution , longer range interactions , or a ( staggered ) magnetic field , rich phase diagrams have been observed  @xcite .",
    "frustrated systems are notoriously difficult to simulate .",
    "naive algorithms such as single - spin - flip dynamics are inefficient at low temperatures , and become non - ergodic   and @xmath10 there is a positive probability that starting in @xmath11 we eventually visit @xmath10 , and vice versa .",
    "] at zero temperature . indeed ,",
    "even the best cluster algorithms  @xcite for simulating low temperature frustrated ising models become non - ergodic at zero temperature , although ergodicity can supposedly be obtained by augmenting the cluster dynamics with single - spin - flip dynamics  @xcite ( a similar hybrid approach is applied to the _ string _ dynamics discussed in  @xcite ) .",
    "cluster algorithms have defined the dominant paradigm for efficient monte carlo simulations of critical lattice models ever since the seminal work of swendsen and wang  @xcite . a more recent idea which is showing",
    "great promise however is the idea of _ worm _ algorithms , first discussed in the context of classical spin models in  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the key idea behind the worm algorithm is to simulate the high - temperature graphs of the spin model , considered as a statistical - mechanical model in their own right .",
    "the worm algorithm for the ising model was recently studied in some detail in @xcite , and it was observed to possess some unusual dynamic features ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , despite its local nature , the worm algorithm was shown to be extraordinarily efficient ",
    "comparable to or better than the swendsen - wang ( sw ) method  for simulating some aspects of the critical three - dimensional ising model  . given this success , a natural question to ask",
    "is whether one can devise a valid worm algorithm to simulate a fully frustrated model such as the zero - temperature triangular - lattice antiferromagnetic ising model .",
    "the short answer is _ yes _",
    ", as we demonstrate in section  [ worm algorithms ] , although it does require a little thought .    worm algorithms provide a natural way to simulate _ eulerian - subgraph models_. given a finite graph @xmath2 , we call a bond configuration @xmath12 _ eulerian _ if every vertex in the subgraph @xmath13 has even degree ( i.e. , every vertex has an even number of incident bonds ; zero is allowed ) .",
    "the set of all such bond configurations defines the _ cycle space _ of @xmath14 , denoted @xmath15 .",
    "perhaps the simplest class of eulerian - subgraph model is defined on the cycle space of a finite graph @xmath2 , for @xmath16 , by the probability measure @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the cyclomatic number of the spanning subgraph @xmath13 .",
    "note that on graphs of maximum degree @xmath19 the only possible eulerian subgraphs consist of a collection of disjoint cycles , or _ loops _ , and @xmath18 is then simply the number of such loops .",
    "consequently , eulerian - subgraph models often go by the name of _ loop models _ , and the honeycomb lattice , being a @xmath20-regular graph , has played a distinguished role in the literature on such loop models @xcite .",
    "these geometric models play a major role in recent developments of conformal field theory @xcite via their connection with schramm loewner evolution ( sle ) @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus on the case @xmath0 , and we write @xmath21 .",
    "in this case it can be seen that ( [ eulerian - subgraph measure ] ) corresponds to an ising model on @xmath14 , and also to an ising model on the dual graph @xmath22 , when @xmath14 is planar .",
    "indeed , it is an elementary exercise to derive the following two identities relating the partition functions of the ising and eulerian - subgraph models @xmath23 note that ( [ high t z ] ) corresponds to an eulerian - subgraph model with positive weights only when @xmath6 , i.e. in the ferromagnetic case , and that only the region @xmath24 is covered by the correspondence .",
    "by contrast , ( [ low t z ] ) gives positive weights for all @xmath25 and corresponds to the whole region @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath27 is small when @xmath28 is small the relation ( [ high t z ] ) is commonly referred to as the _ high - temperature _ expansion of the ising model .",
    "similarly , since @xmath29 is small when @xmath28 is large , i.e. in the ferromagnetic regime at low temperatures , ( [ low t z ] ) is commonly referred to as the _ low temperature _ expansion of the ising model .",
    "however since @xmath29 is in fact large in the antiferromagnetic regime at low temperatures we shall refrain from using this terminology .",
    "the @xmath0 eulerian - subgraph model with @xmath24 thus corresponds to ferromagnetic ising models on both @xmath14 and @xmath22 , while the model with @xmath30 corresponds to an antiferromagnetic ising model on @xmath22 . in particular , we point out that the honeycomb - lattice loop model with @xmath31 corresponds to the triangular - lattice antiferromagnetic ising model .",
    "the honeycomb - lattice loop model exhibits an interesting phase diagram that has been studied in detail  @xcite . when @xmath0 it undergoes an ising phase transition at @xmath32 from a disordered phase when @xmath33 to a _ densely - packed _ phase when @xmath34 .",
    "interestingly , the entire region @xmath34 displays critical behavior , and the model is in the two - dimensional percolation universality class .",
    "the case @xmath35 is of especial interest , and is the focus of this article . in this case",
    "@xmath36 is simply uniform measure on the set of _ fully - packed _ configurations , i.e. the set of all eulerian subgraphs with the maximum possible number of edges , and the model is referred to as the fully - packed loop ( fpl ) model .",
    "it should be emphasized that the fpl model is critical , although it is in a different universality class to the densely - packed phase  @xcite .",
    "every fully - packed bond configuration is such that each vertex is visited by precisely one loop , i.e. each vertex has degree @xmath37 .",
    "therefore only two thirds of the edges are occupied in any given fully - packed configuration ; this fact can be seen as a symptom of the frustration of the triangular - lattice antiferromagnetic ising model . indeed , according to ( [ low t z ] )",
    "the fpl model corresponds to the triangular - lattice antiferromagnetic ising model at _ zero _ temperature .",

    "note that if @xmath57 then @xmath46 is eulerian iff @xmath58 .",
    "thus the bond configurations allowed in the state space of the worm algorithm constitute a superset of the eulerian configurations .",

    "we have @xmath64 .",
    "the first step in constructing the standard worm algorithm is to consider the worm _ proposal matrix _ , @xmath65 , which is defined for all @xmath66 and @xmath51 by @xmath67 = p^{(0)}[(a , v , u)\\to(a\\triangle uu',v , u ' ) ]",

    "a natural question to ask at this stage is what precisely is the relationship between @xmath36 and the worm transition matrix ( [ worm p ] ) ? to address this question , let us consider the markov chain induced on the subset @xmath82 in which the bond configurations are eulerian .",
    "more precisely , let s suppose that we only observe the worm chain when it is in a state in @xmath83 .",

    "a nice discussion of this general problem can be found in @xcite , including a proof of    [ sub - state space chain ] let @xmath88 be an irreducible transition matrix on a finite state space @xmath59 with stationary distribution @xmath89 .",

    "we note that when @xmath14 is planar ( [ worm and eulerian expectations are equal ] ) also implies that the worm algorithm correctly simulates the ising model on @xmath22 considered in ( [ low t z ] ) . indeed , suppose that @xmath14 is planar with dual @xmath96 , and consider the two - to - one correspondence @xmath97 from @xmath98 where @xmath99 in words , for any spin configuration on @xmath22 we draw on @xmath14 the boundaries of the spin domains .",
    "it is an elementary exercise to show that for all @xmath100 we have @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the mass function of the ising model on @xmath22 , as defined in ( [ ising measure ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that although ( [ low t measure relation ] ) is often called a _ low temperature _ representation , it is an exact result valid for all @xmath103 , or equivalently for all @xmath104 . from ( [ low t measure relation ] ) we see explicitly that for any ising observable @xmath105 that is even under global spin flips ( which is the case for all observables of physical interest in zero field ) we have @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath95 is defined by @xmath108 .",
    "consequently ( [ worm and eulerian expectations are equal ] ) does indeed allow us to simulate the ising model on @xmath22 using the worm algorithm .",
    "we should also mention that when @xmath109 the worm algorithm can be used to simulate properties related to the two - point correlation function of the ising model on @xmath14 defined by ( [ high t z ] ) .",
    "indeed , it is straightforward to generalize ( [ high t z ] ) to obtain an expansion for the two - point correlation function @xmath110 as an example of the use of ( [ two - point function relation ] ) , consider the observable @xmath111 on @xmath59 defined so that @xmath112 in other words @xmath111 is the indicator for being in @xmath83 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that provided @xmath14 is regular we have @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the magnetization and the @xmath81 expectations use @xmath115 . in particular , in a translationally invariant system @xmath116    thus when @xmath117 the worm algorithm simulates both an ising model on @xmath14 and an ising model on @xmath22 .",
    "quantities like @xmath111 depend on the full markov chain on @xmath59 , and so if one s interest is to obtain quantities related to the two - point function for the ising model on @xmath14 with @xmath118 then one must consider the full markov chain . however , if one s interest is to compute properties of the eulerian - subgraph model ( [ eulerian - subgraph measure ] ) , or the corresponding ising model on @xmath22 with @xmath119 , then one is only interested in the markov chain induced on @xmath83 .",
    "it is the latter models that are our interest in the present work , and we emphasize that in this case the restriction @xmath109 does not apply .",
    "we note , finally , that @xcite uses ideas similar to lemma  [ sub - state space chain ] and ( [ low t measure relation ] ) to simulate a low temperature ising spin glass with a worm algorithm .      for completeness",
    ", we now briefly address the question of the effect of boundary conditions when @xmath14 is a regular lattice . to illustrate , we consider @xmath120 , where @xmath121 denotes a finite subgraph of the honeycomb lattice drawn on a torus as in fig .",
    "[ fully - packed honeycomb torus ] .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions imply that @xmath121 is non - planar , however we can still construct the dual lattice @xmath122 in the usual way , and it is easy to see that @xmath122 is simply a finite piece of the triangular lattice also drawn on a torus .",
    "it is now no longer the case however that every @xmath123 defines the domain boundaries of an ising spin configuration ; indeed fig .",
    "[ fully - packed honeycomb torus ] provides an example for which no consistent assignment of ising spins is possible .",
    "suppose however that we let @xmath124 denote the set of all @xmath123 which wind the torus an _ even _ number of times in both directions .",
    "for these configurations there is no ambiguity in assigning ising configurations according to the correspondence ( [ dual mapping ] ) , and it is easy to see that ( [ dual mapping ] ) defines a two - to - one correspondence from @xmath125 onto @xmath124 .",
    "it is easy to generalize ( [ low t measure relation ] ) to show that it is now replaced by @xmath126 in addition , if one applies lemma  [ sub - state space chain ] to the subspace @xmath124 then we obtain @xmath127 combining ( [ periodic ising measure ] ) and ( [ even winding worm measure ] ) we see immediately that @xmath128",
    ". therefore if we simulate a worm chain on @xmath121 with coupling @xmath29 and only measure this chain when it is both eulerian _ and _ winds the torus an even number of times , then we are effectively simulating the ising model on @xmath122 at inverse temperature @xmath28 .",
    "thus far we have glossed over an important issue , namely the irreducibility of the worm transition matrix @xmath72 .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath72 is irreducible whenever @xmath129 and @xmath130 are both strictly positive .",
    "problems arise as @xmath43 however , since it is easy to show that if @xmath74\\to[0,1]$ ] satisfies ( [ f equation ] ) then @xmath131 .",
    "consequently , as @xmath43 the probabilities for transitions that remove an edge vanish .",
    "indeed , all states @xmath57 for which both @xmath132 and @xmath133 become absorbing as @xmath43 .",
    "this is easy to see from ( [ identity transitions ] ) since such states have @xmath134=1-f(1/w)$ ] .",
    "suppose now that @xmath14 is @xmath135-regular , i.e. all vertices have degree @xmath135 .",
    "then @xmath53 will be absorbing when @xmath35 iff @xmath136 .",
    "recall that if @xmath57 then when @xmath58 the vertex degree @xmath137 is even , whereas when @xmath138 both @xmath139 and @xmath62 are odd .",

    "therefore once both defects have degree @xmath20 the chain remains in that state for eternity .    how do we resolve this problem",
    "a simple answer is to avoid this trap of endless identity transitions by explicitly forbidding @xmath79 whenever @xmath138 . since",
    ", when simulating eulerian - subgraph models , we only observe the chain when it visits an eulerian state @xmath84 we may hope that by only modifying the transitions from non - eulerian states we may recover irreducibility without sacrificing the correctness of the stationary distribution .",
    "we shall see that this is indeed possible .    to this end",
