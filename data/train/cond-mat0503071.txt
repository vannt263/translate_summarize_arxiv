    "we see that the potential @xmath147 is a confining potential for the variable @xmath114 : our idea is to include in this term , available from dft , the contribution to @xmath0 coming from the particular external potential of the system and from the fermionic structure of the wavefunction .",
    "the remaining part to be approximated , the correlation potential @xmath148 , must include the effect of the e - e repulsion while keeping the density fixed , i.e. , it must be essentially a screened coulomb interaction .",

    "a more sophisticated effective potential , based on a self - consistent hartree approximation , extended such accuracy to the long - range part of the ueg @xmath0 at metallic densities  @xcite .",
    "other simple approximations for @xmath80 in the ueg have also been proposed and tested  @xcite .",
    "we have presented the ideas concerning a theory based on the spherically and system - averaged pair density @xmath0 , and we have suggested to combine it with dft to obtain system - adapted correlation energy functionals .",
    "so far , the method has been tested for the he series  @xcite and for the uniform electron gas  @xcite , yielding promising results .    in order to completely develop the approach presented here , many steps are still to be performed and many issues are to be addressed . among them ,",
    "the most relevant ones concern the construction of better approximations for the effective electron - electron interaction that enters the formalism , and the implementation of a self - consistent scheme to combine the kohn - sham equations with the correlation energy functional arising from our approach .",
    "last but not least , with the approximations tested so far our approach works very well for the short - range part of @xmath0 , so that the combination with multideterminantal dft  @xcite ( in which only the short - range correlations are treated within dft ) is also very promising and deserves further investigation .",
