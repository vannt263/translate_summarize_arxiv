    "isaac newton wrote in a famous letter to robert hooke : _ if i have seen further , it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants_. one of these _ giants _ was , of course , nicolaus copernicus and it is an honor to give this talk in this , his alma mater .",
    "innovations in physics can not be seen in isolation  they rely heavily on previous work , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "interested people have gone before and ( hopefully ) will come after .",
    "i have been asked , as an informed outsider , to try to answer the question of how the cosy11 program fitted into the development of one specialized branch of physics ?",
    "cosy11 is a very _ simple _ but effective facility , designed to measure the production of meson(s ) in nucleon ",
    "nucleon collisions near threshold .",
    "_ i.e. _  at an energy a little above the minimum necessary for the process to happen",
    ". it uses the specific characteristics of the cosy = cooler synchrotron at the forschungszentrum jlich .",
    "cosy can accelerate protons up to nearly 3gev and store them at a fixed energy ( coasting beam ) for tens of minutes .",
    "this is achieved by having the particles confined in a 180 m vacuum ring by a series of magnets .",
    "the magnetic force is just sufficient to counteract the natural tendency for the protons to go in a straight line .",
    "the cosy11 _ trick _ relies on the fact that , if the proton loses energy through an interaction in the target , the magnetic force is too strong and the particle is bent to the inside of the ring by an amount that depends upon its momentum . it ( or another particle ) is then detected by drift chambers , silicon pad detectors , and/or scintillation counters . the basic layout and the principal components are shown in the schematic diagram of fig .  [ fig1 ] , but more detailed descriptions are to be found elsewhere in these proceedings .    ]",
    "most of our body mass is composed of protons and the proton  proton ( @xmath0 ) interaction is fundamental .",
    "however , above a certain energy mesons can be produced in @xmath0 collisions and so the @xmath0 force can not be studied in isolation  it is part of a coupled system of nucleons and mesons . for this reason alone",
    "it is clear that one must measure production reactions .",
    "because of the uncertainty principle , if mesons with masses of several hundreds of mev / c@xmath1 are created , the reaction is going to depend upon the proton  proton force at very short distances  perhaps even shorter than the size of the proton itself .",
    "to understand the methodology of the cosy11 technique , we first have to discuss the principles behind a missing  mass measurement . consider the reaction @xmath2 . if the momenta and hence the energies of two outgoing protons @xmath3 and @xmath4 are measured , and those of the beam proton @xmath5 and target @xmath6 are known , then the momentum @xmath7 energy @xmath8 of the system @xmath9 are also both known .",
    "the mass @xmath10 of the produced meson can then be calculated from @xmath11 .",
    "thus at cosy11 one never measured the neutral meson @xmath9 directly but rather inferred that it had been produced by considering the kinematics of the other particles in the final state .",
    "let us look first at the case of @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13 is a heavy brother of the pion , belonging to the same fundamental pseudoscalar nonet .",
    "however , its mass is even a bit bigger than that of the proton . in order to compare results for mesons with widely different masses , we normally present data in terms of the kinetic energy in the exit channel .",
    "thus we define the excess energy of the reaction as being @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the total center  of  mass ( c.m . ) energy .",
    "reaction measured with the spesiii spectrometer at saturne at a proton beam energy of @xmath16mev  @xcite . in the upper panel the closed circles represent the actual data whereas the crosses are estimates of the background obtained from measurements taken below the reaction threshold .",
    "the differences are shown by the points in the lower panel .",
    "these are compared to the monte carlo simulation of the @xmath17 reaction for @xmath18mev , which is shown by the histogram.[fig3 ] ]    the basic problems of a missing  mass experiment are the minimization and evaluation of the background under the peak of the @xmath13 or other meson .",
    "the amount of background is usually decided by doing measurements also below threshold . however , the better the mass resolution , the easier it is to control the background .",
    "having subtracted the suitably scaled background from the actual measurements , one ends up with a peak around the meson mass .",
    "this is illustrated in the case of the spesiii measurements from saturne  @xcite which are shown in fig .",
    "the next step is to make sure that the peak that has been generated in this way has the right shape and this is done by doing a computer ( monte carlo ) simulation , where one feeds in as much information about the reaction and the experimental apparatus and conditions as possible . for a spectrometer like cosy11 or spesiii , there is a limited coverage of the angles , _",
    "i.e. _  there is a restricted geometrical acceptance .",
    "furthermore , in certain regions the counters may have limitations and this reduces even further the overall acceptance .",
    "the monte carlo simulations are of tremendous importance in modern particle and nuclear physics because they allow one to correct to some extent for these deficiencies .",
    "the monte carlo of the @xmath13 peak in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] fits the data reasonably well and this gives some confidence in the number of @xmath17 events extracted .",
    "reaction obtained at an excitation energy of @xmath19mev with respect to the @xmath13 peak  @xcite .",
    "the left panel shows the total count rate in bins of 0.4mev / c@xmath1 ( solid histogram ) compared to the background that is shown dashed .",
    "the difference in the right panel is compared with the monte carlo simulation of @xmath13 production . [ fig4],title=\"fig : \" ]    reaction obtained at an excitation energy of @xmath19mev with respect to the @xmath13 peak  @xcite .",
    "the left panel shows the total count rate in bins of 0.4mev / c@xmath1 ( solid histogram ) compared to the background that is shown dashed .",
    "the difference in the right panel is compared with the monte carlo simulation of @xmath13 production .",
    "[ fig4],title=\"fig : \" ]    the @xmath17 reaction was studied at two energies at spesiii  @xcite but it was measured at fifteen energies at cosy11  @xcite , the results for one of which is shown in fig .",
    "both the excitation energy @xmath20 and numbers of @xmath13 events were very similar to those of the spesiii data of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . however , the better energy determination at cosy allowed finer mass bins to be used ( 0.4 rather then 1.0mev / c@xmath1 ) .",
    "this gives rise to a smoother background but it is important to note that the shape of this background is influenced by the specific characteristics of the spectrometer .",
    "this is seen even more clearly for the @xmath13 peak itself  the distribution is far more symmetric at cosy11 and this is what was to be expected on the basis of the monte carlo simulation that is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "one very important parameter is the signal  to  background ratio at the @xmath13 peak .",
    "this is strongly influenced by the resolution  the narrower the peak the easier it is to isolate its contribution to the production rate .",
    "for cosy11 this is about 1:1 whereas at spesiii it was only 1:3 .",
    "it is clear that cosy11 was very well suited for the study of such production experiments .",
    "the @xmath17 total cross section varies smoothly with excess energy q when plotted on the logarithmic scale of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . since the @xmath13nucleon force is believed to be relatively weak",
    ", we would expect that this energy dependence should be largely given by phase space , modified by the effect due to the interaction of the two outgoing protons in the final state .",
    "this is particularly strong in the @xmath21wave because there is a virtual state with a ` binding ' energy of @xmath22mev .     and @xmath17 with excess energy @xmath20 .",
    "the cosy11 experimental results , shown by stars , are taken from refs .",
    "data of other groups , shown by circles , are from refs .",
    "the model of eq .",
    "( [ formula ] ) , that only includes phase space plus the @xmath0 final state interaction  @xcite , fails to describe the @xmath23 production data in the near  threshold region , whereas it is perfectly adequate for the @xmath13 .",
    "[ fig6 ] ]    if only the virtual bound state pole is taken into account , one can easily obtain an analytic expression for the shape of the energy dependence in the non ",
    "relativistic approximation  @xcite : @xmath24 although @xmath25 is fixed just by the @xmath0 interaction , the value of @xmath26 depends on the full dynamics of the @xmath17 reaction . the @xmath13 data of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , which are completely dominated by measurements from cosy11 , are well represented by this description .",
    "the @xmath23 meson has a much smaller mass than the @xmath13 and several groups have measured the total cross section for @xmath27 and a selection of their results is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] along with those of @xmath13 production .",
    "a fascinating point seen here is that , unlike the case of @xmath13 production , the _ ansatz _ of eq .",
    "( [ formula ] ) can not reproduce simultaneously the low and higher @xmath20 data .",
    "the curve underpredicts the data below about 10mev .",
    "this is almost certainly the signal for a very strong interaction in the final state , where the @xmath23 bounces between the two protons . for heavier nuclei",
    "this final state interaction becomes so strong that the @xmath23 becomes trapped for some time around the nucleus  but more of this later !",
    "however , one also notices from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] that the cross section for @xmath13 production is about 25 times smaller than for the @xmath23 .",
    "it is a fairly general feature that , as the mass of the meson is increased , the cross section drops .",
    "this is due mainly to the momentum transfer from the initial to the final protons rising with meson mass . on the other hand",
    ", the background does not fall in the same way and it becomes increasingly difficult to identify the meson purely through a missing ",
    "mass peak .",
    "coincidence measurements of the photons and pions arising from the decay of the meson are then also required .",
    "this is one part of the wasa program which has already started at cosy  @xcite .",
    "for example , the reaction @xmath28 has been identified cleanly through the decay chain @xmath29 .",
    "thus , although cosy11 has been laid to rest , the succession is assured through the wasa spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "the second major cosy11 success came from measuring @xmath30 and @xmath31 production in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 reactions . in such cases",
    "one has to study final kaon  proton correlated pairs instead of the proton  proton required for @xmath23 and @xmath13 production .",
    "collisions as functions of the excess energy @xmath20 .",
    "the experimental points for the @xmath32 reaction come from cosy11 ( up and down triangles )  @xcite and cosy  tof ( closed squares )  @xcite .",
    "the curve corresponds to the predictions of phase space moderated by a final  state interaction between the @xmath30 and the proton .",
    "the cosy11 @xmath34 points ( closed circles and stars )  @xcite and two cosy  tof points ( open squares )  @xcite are compared to phase  space predictions .",
    "[ fig7 ] ]    @xmath35 are much rarer in the final state than protons and it is not possible to get an unambiguous identification just from the available information on the trajectory and time of flight .",
    "therefore one takes the events around the kaon mass to see if the missing mass then corresponds to a @xmath30 or a @xmath31 . in this way islands corresponding to the two reactions can be isolated .",
    "experiments could be done simultaneously at two different energies to compensate for the mass difference of @xmath36mev / c@xmath1 . for this purpose",
    "the supercycle mode was used , where the beam was accelerated to one energy and left to coast under stable conditions while the @xmath30 production was measured .",
    "the beam energy was then raised further to allow the @xmath31 to be studied before the energy was lowered again .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .    apart from a couple of points from cosy ",
    "tof  @xcite , the @xmath30 data are dominated by results from cosy11  @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath35 interacts weakly with the final proton , the @xmath37 final  state interaction is known to be quite strong .",
    "the @xmath30 does just bind with the deuteron and heavier @xmath30hypernuclei have been studied for fifty years . however , though the @xmath37 force is attractive , it is not quite attractive enough to form a bound state and instead there is a virtual state at an energy of @xmath38mev .",
    "if this were the only distortion of phase space , the energy dependence of the cross section would be given by eq .",
    "( [ formula ] ) and the resulting curve does give a good description of the data in the figure with this value of @xmath25 .    on the other hand , there is no convincing evidence for the existence of @xmath39hypernuclei . while this could be due to their having very large widths engendered by the strong decay @xmath40 , the cosy11 data , which dominate fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , offer a much simpler explanation .",
    "the @xmath33 total cross section follows a phase ",
    "space @xmath41 variation , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ formula ] ) .",
    "this is what we would expect if there were no strong interaction between the @xmath31 and the proton .",
    "the obvious conclusion is that there are no @xmath39hypernuclei because the @xmath39nucleon force is not very attractive .",
    "and @xmath34 reactions at the same values of the excess energy @xmath20 .",
    "the cosy11 points  @xcite are compared to the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ formula2 ] ) where a final  state interaction is only invoked in the @xmath37 channel .",
    "[ fig8 ] ]    because of the very different final  state interactions in the @xmath37 and @xmath43 systems , the energy dependence of the ratio of their production cross sections is very sharply peaked to @xmath44 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the data are well described by just including the @xmath37 interaction , and this leads to : @xmath45 here @xmath46mev is the position of the virtual @xmath37 state and @xmath47 depends upon the details of the dynamics of both @xmath30 and @xmath31 production .",
    "it is evident that cosy11 was very well suited for the study of hyperon production in proton ",
    "proton reactions .",
    "the obvious questions left to be answered are :    * what is the production like in proton  neutron collisions ? * what is the spin dependence of the production with polarized beams and polarized targets ?",
    "experiments at cosy ",
    "anke and/or cosy  tof might help to resolve some of these questions  but they will not be easy to carry out !",
    "neutron detection have already been attempted at cosy11 for the @xmath48 reaction using a deuterium target  @xcite . for this one",
    "has to measure both the low energy _ spectator _",
    "proton from the deuteron target as well as the fast final neutron .",
    "this is clearly an ambitious program given the low overall acceptance but , even with only 19% of the data analyzed , a clear @xmath13 signal is seen .",
    "two of the least understood of the light mesons are the scalar ( spin0 , positive parity ) @xmath49 pair , both of which have masses around 980mev / c@xmath1 .",
    "they are found dominantly in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 channels , respectively , but are also ` seen ' in @xmath52  @xcite . since the @xmath53 threshold is at 987.4mev / c@xmath1 , this channel distorts the shapes of the @xmath54 resonance peaks  they may even be mainly molecular rather than quark  antiquark states .",
    "the question asked at cosy was whether one could measure the production of these resonances in proton  proton collisions through the detection of their @xmath53 decay branch .",
    "the experimental data are taken from refs .",
    "@xcite ( open star ) , @xcite ( open cross ) , @xcite ( closed stars ) , @xcite ( triangles ) , and @xcite ( inverted triangle ) . for data that were measured above the @xmath55 threshold ,",
    "only the contribution from non@xmath55 production is reported here .",
    "the curve is the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ formula ] ) to a four  body phase space , the analytic formula for which is to be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "[ fig9 ] ]    the disto collaboration at saturne measured the cross section for @xmath56 at quite high excess energy  @xcite .",
    "however , since the reaction involves a four  body final state , the cross section drops very fast as threshold is approached . on the other hand",
    ", the limited angular coverage meant that at cosy11 the reaction could only be studied near threshold .",
    "the protons were measured here as before , using the time of flight from a start to a stop scintillator .",
    "because of its smaller mass the @xmath35 has a lower momentum near the reaction threshold and is therefore bent more by the analyzing dipole .",
    "the start signal for this particle was deduced from the measurement of the two protons rather than being directly determined .",
    "one complication is that kaons die quite quickly and this reduced significantly the overall acceptance .",
    "having identified the two protons , as well as a candidate for the @xmath35 , the final selection of the @xmath57 reaction was performed by evaluating the missing mass with respect to the @xmath58 trio and making sure that it was equal to that of the @xmath59 .",
    "the four lowest energy points in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] come from cosy11  @xcite , with the higher energy data being measured at anke  @xcite and disto  @xcite . the only distortion to the four  body phase space considered in the curve is that due to the @xmath0 final  state interaction  @xcite and , when this is normalized to the high@xmath20 points , it undershoots considerably the data at low @xmath20 .",
    "it therefore seems likely that there must be an additional important final ",
    "state interaction among the @xmath60 particles .",
    "direct evidence for this is to be found in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , where the ratio of the number of events ( corrected for acceptance ) for @xmath61 and @xmath62 is plotted against the invariant mass in the @xmath63 system .",
    "there are far more events with low @xmath61 invariant mass than @xmath62 .",
    "since the @xmath62 force is known to be weak , the obvious conclusion to draw is that there is also a strong @xmath61 final  state interaction , possibly connected with the influence of the @xmath64 hyperon resonance that is a little below the @xmath61 threshold .    the cosy11 measurements  @xcite were made below the threshold for @xmath55 production and , for the analogous data from anke  @xcite , care has to be taken to distinguish between @xmath55 and non@xmath55 production .",
    "after this has been done , the higher energy data show all the same features as those presented in fig .  [ fig10 ] but with higher statistics .",
    "in fact , the shape of the entire @xmath65 data set at different energies can be described quantitatively through the introduction of a universal @xmath61 final  state interaction  @xcite .     and @xmath62 in a given invariant mass bin measured from the @xmath63 threshold .",
    "the cosy11 data at @xmath66mev ( closed circles ) and 28mev ( crosses ) were reported in ref .",
    "it should be noted that the 10mev results have been scaled up by a factor of about 3.5 so that they can be compared more easily with the higher energy results .",
    "[ fig10 ] ]    analogous enhancements of the @xmath67 invariant  mass spectrum are seen in the @xmath68 reaction  @xcite .",
    "thus the cosy11 and the cosy  anke data , taken together , quite clearly show that the @xmath59 is strongly attracted to nucleons and this is likely to develop further for heavier nuclei . on the other hand , the strength of the @xmath61 force is such that it will be very hard to extract much information on the @xmath54 complex from @xmath56 or similar reactions . however , physics is a continuous development .",
    "the results in one experiment influence ideas at other facilities and the scalar meson search will be continued at cosy ",
    "wasa  @xcite .",
    "the last example that i have chosen to illustrate the cosy11 legacy involves @xmath23 production in the three  nucleon sector . when i discussed the @xmath28 reaction i stressed that , unlike the case of the @xmath13 , the data seemed to require a strong interaction of the @xmath23 with one or two of the final protons .    .",
    "the refined cosy11 ( open stars )  @xcite and cosy  anke data ( closed stars )  @xcite are hard to distinguish on this plot .",
    "the very  close  to  threshold data , which are important in the evaluation of the pole position , are not shown because of the differences in the energy smearing in this region .",
    "the early saturne backwards measurements are also shown , as is the parameterization taken from the spesiv paper  @xcite .",
    "[ fig11 ] ]    the situation is more extreme for @xmath70 where it has even been speculated that the @xmath23 might even be trapped , at least momentarily , while going around the @xmath71he nucleus  @xcite .",
    "early saturne measurements of the total cross section near threshold  @xcite gave strong support for these ideas and the new very refined measurements from cosy11  @xcite and cosy ",
    "anke  @xcite show conclusively that there is a pole in the @xmath70 scattering amplitude , corresponding to a quasi  bound or virtual state , within about an mev of the threshold .",
    "the precise number depends upon exactly how one takes the smearing of the beam momentum into account ; this can be important when one is discussing the difference between 1.0 or 0.5mev !",
    "the cosy11 and cosy  anke experiments both benefited from the negligible thickness of the target material and the ability of the cosy machine crew to ramp up the energy in fine steps as a function of time .",
    "fortunately , the two data sets are completely consistent within the systematic error bars , as is shown by the plot of the square of the backward production amplitude shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "this geometry is chosen so that data at higher energy  @xcite could be shown on the same plot in order to illustrate the continuity of the physics .",
    "the curve presented in the figure is the parameterization of the spesiv low  @xcite and higher energy data  @xcite .",
    "however , the position of the quasi  bound ( or virtual ) state pole in the complex @xmath20plane depends a lot on the data very close to threshold and this is hard to obtain with an external beam and a macroscopic target  @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath70 total cross section shows that the of the @xmath72wave production amplitude @xmath73 decreases fast with excess energy @xmath20 ( or the @xmath23 center  of  mass momentum @xmath74 ) .",
    "however , to prove conclusively that @xmath73 has a pole near @xmath44 it would be highly desirable to show that the phase of @xmath73 also varies very rapidly in this region .",
    "evidence for this comes from the study of the angular dependence of the cross section  @xcite .",
    "for both the cosy11 and cosy  anke data it is seen that the differential cross section is linear in the cosine of the @xmath23 angle with respect to the initial proton : @xmath75     of the @xmath76 reaction defined by eq .",
    "( [ angle ] ) as a function of the @xmath23 c.m",
    ".  momentum .",
    "the experimental data from cosy  anke ( closed circles )  @xcite and cosy11 ( open circles )  @xcite are compared to fits ( solid and broken lines ) where the phase variation of the @xmath72wave production amplitude associated with the pole in the complex plane close to @xmath77 is taken into account .",
    "if the phase variation is neglected , the best fit ( dotted curve ) fails to describe the data .",
    "[ fig12 ] ]    near threshold , the asymmetry parameter @xmath78 must arise from an interference between @xmath72 and @xmath79waves of the final @xmath80 system and simple kinematic arguments would suggest that @xmath78 should vary linearly with @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "this is , however , modified a little because of the falling of the magnitude of @xmath73 with momentum .",
    "nevertheless , if one just takes into account the decrease of @xmath81 , one can not reproduce the momentum dependence of @xmath78 illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "this parameter seems to be small , or possibly even negative , for low @xmath74 , and it is only above about 4050mev / c that it starts to take off .",
    "this means that the sign of the @xmath72@xmath79 interference must be changing fast with @xmath74 and hence that the phase of @xmath73 is a very sensitive function of @xmath74 . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] are shown the cosy11 and cosy  anke data with crude fits to the @xmath78 variation where the feedback of the @xmath79waves to the total cross section has been neglected .",
    "if , and only if , the phase variation associated with the quasi  bound state pole is included in the fits can the momentum variation of @xmath78 be understood .",
    "more precise modelling , where the total cross section and angular distributions are fit simultaneously  @xcite , does not change this conclusion in any material way .",
    "both data sets require the magnitude phase of the @xmath72wave amplitude to vary in the way expected if there is a pole in @xmath73 for small @xmath82 .",
    "production data of this kind can never prove whether the pole corresponds to a quasi  bound or a virtual state but , in either case , the cosy data have shown that there is a very unusual nuclear system .",
    "this is a tribaryon with an excitation energy of about 550mev but a width of only a very few mev .",
    "it is not , of course , stable because it can decay with the emission of nucleons and possibly pions .",
    "hence one of the last of the cosy11 experiments seems to confirm the existence of this very strange nuclear state .",
    "i have lived through the closure of many machines  the cosmotron at brookhaven , the cern sc , the orsay sc , the saturne machine at saclay , and the celsius storage ring at uppsala .",
    "what really matters is the people and how they take what they have learned at one facility and apply it in another environment .",
    "hadronic physics has advanced because of cosy11 and there are many possibilities to push even further forward , especially using cosy  wasa  @xcite .",

    "german collaboration has been tremendously successful in personal terms ; i have found them to be a real delight to work with .",
    "the challenge is to ensure that this atmosphere continues in the same way in the larger multinational cosy  wasa setting .",
    "as has been made clear many times in this meeting , the symbol of cosy11 has been a goat .",
    "it is clear that i must have been a supporter of cosy11 long before the facility was conceived since the ceramic plaque of a goat by picasso shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] has been hanging on a dining room wall in my house for the past forty years .",
    "the message that i would like to leave you with is that , to a first approximation , goats eat anything  and survive !",
    "i am very grateful to the organizers of the meeting for being offered the opportunity to highlight some of the cosy11 successes over the years .",
    "the selection has been very much a personal one that has been tremendously biased by my own interests and the presentation has been greatly influenced by my own views on the physics involved .",
