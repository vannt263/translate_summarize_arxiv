    "the baryonic fraction of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is composed by dillute warm / hot plasmas . depending on the local environment the plasma properties of the igm may be different .",
    "for instance , the most diffuse component of the igm , known as intergalactic  voids \" , are vast regions between clusters of galaxies in the universe as seen today . filaments of somewhat compressed and warmer ( @xmath1k ) gas form what is broadly understood as the igm , while the denser ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) and shock heated ( @xmath4k ) plasma in clusters of galaxies are known as the intracluster medium ( icm ) . for many decades",
    "the intracluster medium is known to be magnetized ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , but unfortunately any contraints on the magnetization of the igm and intergalactic voids lack of more substantial observational confirmation . the magnetic intensity and its respective correlation length must naturally be related to the processes from which they originate and/or amplify , which depend on local dynamical and physical properties .",
    "however , the origin and/or amplification of the magnetic fields at cosmological scales are not completely understood yet , and represent a long standing major issue in modern astrophysics .",
    "seed fields may have been generated at the pre - equipartition epoch by subatomic scale processes , such as hadron phase transitions , or at later ( post - equipartition ) and pre - galactic epoch by large - scale magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) processes , e.g. the @xmath5 battery term from ohm s law @xcite , currents induced by electronic scattering of anisotropic radiation fields @xcite , evolution of turbulent fields ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and many others ) , and even shock excited weibel instabilities @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggests however that photon diffusion damping would affect post - equipartition , but pre - recombination , magnetic fluctuations",
    ". therefore most of the amplification processes mentioned above would only be important after recombination era .",
    "theese could in principle generate magnetic fields with intensities of the order of @xmath6 g .",
    "there are several implications of a strong magnetic field on the cosmological evolution of the universe , from primordial nucleosynthesis to the statistics of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "current data limits the primordial ( comoving ) magnetic field intensity to @xmath7ng at 1mpc lengthscale ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for references on wmap and planck data analysis , respectively ) .",
    "such field intensities are below the values inferred for the icm ( @xmath8 g ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ) , as well as for more diffuse groups of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently , arguable lower limits for the magnetization of the diffuse intergalactic medium have been also provided based on gamma - ray observations of blazars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these evidences combined together suggest that the universe was magnetized even before the structure formation .",
    "therefore , the problem seems to be twofold : the first being the actual origin of the magnetic fields ( seed fields ) , which may have occured very early in the universe history ( pre - equipartition ) ; and the second being the amplification of such seed fields to the values observed in the diffuse gas of clusters of galaxies .",
    "observations of the faraday rotation ( fr ) effect provide currently the best estimates for the igm magnetic fields . in the fr effect the position angle of linearly polarized radiation shifts on the plane of sky as a function of wavelength @xmath9 as @xmath10 , with the rotation measure @xmath11 being @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the direction parallel to the line of sight .",
    "it is well - known that rm strongly depends on the spatial distribution of the electron density ( @xmath14 ) and the magnetic field geometry along the line of sight ( @xmath15 ) , and basic geometrical assumptions with respect to them are usually made .",
    "it is also natural to presume that the igm magnetic field is not uniform .",
    "faraday rotation maps present ordered magnetic fluctuations at scales from @xmath16kpc associated with cooling flows up to @xmath16mpc associated to powerful active galactic nuclei ( agn ) jets and cluster radio relics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these lengthscales , however , can not be directly understood as correlation scales for the magnetic field .",
    "observational estimates of typical lengthscales usually assume an _ ad hoc _ correlation between the magnetic field and local plasma density in the range of @xmath17kpc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , given the turbulent nature of the igm , the actual correlation length ( @xmath18 ) of the igm / icm magnetic field depends also on the spatial distribution of the velocity field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath18 for the magnetic field of the igm can not be observationally estimated yet .",
    "still , even though around equipartition level with the thermal and kinetic counterparts , the presence of strong magnetic fields ( @xmath19 g ) is surprising , given the general understanding that @xmath20 g scale fields would be the result of galactic dynamo amplification of much less intense pre - galactic seed fields and the related timescales .    during the last decade",
    "several authors have employed numerical simulations and analytical approximate solutions of collisional plasmas to study the magnetic amplification due to turbulent dynamo , galactic fields diffused into the icm by outflows , and agns ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "such degeneracy among different mechanisms could be removed if the correlation lengths of density , velocity and magnetic fields were directly and independently obtained observationally .",
    "this because the different processes suggested so far operate at either different scales , or with different cross - correlations between the physical parameters ( @xmath21,@xmath22,@xmath23,@xmath24 )",
    ". however , the possibility that @xmath20 g magnetic fields could be present in vast volumes of the more diffuse intergalactic medium , where the density of galaxies and the impact of agns are relatively small , points to the turbulent dynamo as a viable and ubiquitous process .",

    "turbulent cells stretch and fold field lines in a weakly magnetized plasma increasing the total magnetic energy .",
    "such a dynamo can in principle operate at the large range of scales where there is turbulence , depending on the properties of the flow .",
    "this was first pointed out by @xcite , and further developed into the kraichnan - kazantsev theory @xcite . here , and",
    "throughout this paper , we assume the intergalactic plasma to be a highly conducting medium in the sense that the resistivity ( @xmath25 ) is much smaller than the viscosity ( @xmath26 ) , i.e. the prandtl number @xmath27 . in this case",
    ", the small - scale dynamo ( ssd ) theory predicts an exponential growth of magnetic energy , up to equipartition at the viscous scale .",
    "the power spectrum of the magnetic fluctuations is then proportional to @xmath28 , resulting in a concentration of energy at small scales .",
    "once saturated at small scales , the dynamo enters in a nonlinear phase showing slower amplification rates ( linear with time ) .",
    "the scale at which turbulence is dissipated regulates the efficiency of nonlinear phase for the dynamo process .",
    "if we consider the standard collisionality of the icm , the non - linear phase of the turbulent dynamo is possibly of little interest for cosmological magnetic field studies .",
    "it has been suggested though that the enhanced effective collisionality due to plasma instabilities could even completely suppress the kinetic phase , and the nonlinear dynamo would be all that is left ( see * ? ? ?",
    "as we discuss below , for the purpose of this work , the exact determination of the transition between kinetic and nonlinear regimes is not relevant . due to the little understanding of the anomalous collisionality in diffuse media , and the fact that the nonlinear regime is even slower than the kinetic one",
    ", we will concentrate only on the early kinetic phase .",
    "we may consider that during the kinetic phase the magnetic field intensity increases as @xmath29 , being the timescale @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the turbulent amplitude at the viscous scale @xmath32 .",

    "large turbulent reynolds numbers result in faster ssds , however the saturation occurs at lower amplification levels reducing its effectiveness . in the opposite trend ,",
    "relatively smaller values of @xmath40 result in slower ssds , but with larger @xmath41 . however , in order to explain the cosmological amplification of magnetic fields after recombination era we need large @xmath41 and fast amplification . during the formation of clusters of galaxies , starting at at @xmath42 ( which represents a _ look back time _ of @xmath43gyrscdm cosmological model , assuming a dark energy density @xmath44 , matter density ( baryons + dark matter ) @xmath45 and a hubble parameter @xmath46 ) , velocities of the order of hundreds of km / s are driven at scales as large as @xmath47mpc . for typical intergalactic gas densities of @xmath48@xmath3 one",
    "finds @xmath49 g for @xmath50 , which resembles the values expected for the igm using the spitzer viscosity . for a seed field @xmath51ng , using the same parameters , one also finds @xmath52gyrs .",
    "it is clear , at least from these crude estimates , that only superestimated values of the magnetic seed field and a fine tunned reynolds number could explain the magnetic field intensities observed in the local universe ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".    given the inefficient amplification of the field by the turbulent dynamo , another mechanism must be considered .",
    "it has been recently pointed that the igm may not be well described by a standard mhd theory .",
    "the intergalactic plasma , extremely rarefied , behaves as a gyrotropic collisionless plasma , i.e. the larmor radius of the ions ( @xmath53 ) is smaller than the mean free path @xmath54 , being @xmath55 the ion - ion collision cross - section @xcite .",
    "this relation can be rewritten as the condition for gyrotropic plasmas as @xmath56 . in the standard @xmath57cdm universe , with an average density of baryons at @xmath58 of @xmath59@xmath3 and @xmath60ev , one finds @xmath61 for magnetic fields larger than @xmath62 g , which decreases with time as the universe expands .",
    "therefore , for the given seed fields above , it is natural to assume the intergalactic plasma as gyrotropic . if not during its whole evolution post - recombination evolution , at least from the time when the condition @xmath63 is satisfied .    even in the fluid approximation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cgl - mhd hereafter ) gyrotropic plasmas are subject to a number of instabilities that provide fast interchange of internal , kinetic and magnetic energies .",
    "@xcite presented a simplified analytical study of the time evolution of the magnetic energy in the icm based on such instabilities .",
    "their conclusion was that collisionless plasma instabilities may result in an `` explosive '' growth of magnetic energies in very short timescales compared to the cosmological evolution of the system .",
    "however , such idea has not yet been extended into a full theory nor tested numerically , which is the main goal of this work .    in the present paper",
    "we study numerically the amplification of magnetic fields in turbulent collisionless plasmas , under the cgl - mhd formalism . in order to achieve this goal we provide a number of direct numerical simulations of plasma flows , with forced turbulence , threaded initially by extremely weak seed fields .",
    "collisionless plasma instabilities are included .",
    "the basic theoretical aspects of such problem is discussed in section 2 .",
    "the numerical setup and algorithms used are provided in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we present the main results , followed by the discussions and the conclusions .",
    "the proper description of collisionless plasmas relies on the full calculation of the particle dynamics , including both eletromagnetic and collisional forces .",
    "unfortunately such approach is of little practical use , with no analytical model available yet .",
    "one of the alternatives for this problem relies on numerically integrating the equation of motion of an ensemble of charged test particles ( ions ) , coupled to a fluid ( electrons ) . such approach is also called particle - in - cell ( pic ) numerical simulations .",
    "pic simulations provide the dynamical evolution of momentum distributions of particles as they interact with magnetic fields and due to collisions , which allow us to directly study e.g. the effects of collisionless plasma instabilities on the isotropization of pressures , or on the rise of pressure anisotropies .",
    "however , the spatial coverage of the computational domain in pic simulations is limited to a finite number of larmor radii .",
    "for this reason it is not possible to study both the evolution of the distributions of particle momenta and the system dynamics at large scales , such in the case of the igm , simultaneously . at first approximation",
    ", we may consider the distribution of momenta of particles to be maxwellian ( or bi - maxwellian in the case of magnetized collisionless plasmas ) , for which a fluid description of a pressure - anisotropic plasma is available @xcite .",

    "the source term @xmath77 , in the equations above , represents the external force responsible for driving the turbulence .",
    "the set of equations given in eq.[eqn : collisionless_mhd ] is not closed . since the perpendicular and parallel pressures can evolve differently from each other , another equation relating the time evolution of @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    "is needed .",
    "the original double - adiabatic condition proposed in @xcite , based on the conservation of first and second magnetic invariants , leads to :    @xmath80    the cgl - mhd double - adiabatic closure equations above may not be exactly correct .",
    "it is known that several processes , e.g. collisions or enhanced particle scattering by magnetic mirrors ( or firehoses ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ) , break these invariants . another possible closure for eq.[eqn : collisionless_mhd ]",
    "is obtained by simply assuming that the system reaches a pressure anisotropy equilibrium fast enough , so @xmath81 during the whole evolution . the closure problem is discussed in more details in the following sections .      a linear perturbation analysis of eq.[eqn : collisionless_mhd ] results in the known modified dispersion relations in gyrotropic plasmas given below ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we must point out that there is a factor of @xmath89 for the later , which is not present in the threshold of the actual mirror instability obtained from the kinetic theory .",
    "this offset is a well - known issue in the cgl - mhd closure , but this is not relevant for this work as we focus on the evolution of the firehose mode only .",

    "the magnetic moment , or first adiabatic invariant , @xmath93 = constant , of a charged particle subject to the magnetic force , is also quasi - invariant for a plasma .",
    "therefore , by approximating @xmath94 to the thermal velocity @xmath95 , associated to the maxwellian distribution of velocity components perpendicular to the magnetic field , and assuming @xmath96 , we find @xmath97 , and eq.[anisotropy ] results in :    @xmath98    where    @xmath99    represents an effective isotropization rate ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "notice that the first term in the right hand side of the equation above corresponds to the time evolution of @xmath79 as a consequence of the changes in @xmath90 and @xmath78 .",
    "from here we describe the interchange of parallel and perpendicular pressures , mediated by magnetic fluctuations , as the net magnetic scattering of the particle distributions ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the last term of the equation above has been deliberately added to account for the effect of collisions , by means of a braginskii collision frequency @xmath102 . from these two terms",
    "it is possible to consider two different regimes with : i ) collision dominated isotropization , for @xmath103 ; and ii ) scattering dominated isotropization , for @xmath104 .",
    "the effect of collisionless instabilities on the pitch angle ( magnetic ) scattering is not fully understood .",
    "if we take the firehose instability as example , perturbations ( e.g. in the velocity field ) may result in local growth of magnetic field intensity ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "this in turn results in an increase of the perpendicular velocities of the ions , i.e. an increase of @xmath78 , at the expense of a decrease of @xmath79 .",
    "this could in principle be used to estimate @xmath106 .",
    "however the total internal energy may not be conserved if particles are lost during scattering , or if other energy loss processes are included , making the problem not practical without a full kinetic description .",
    "an alternative , as pointed by @xcite , is to assume this term to saturate the amplification of the magnetic field perturbations quasi - linearly at the wavelength of fastest growth , which occurs around the larmor radius ( @xmath107 , being @xmath108 the cyclotron frequency of the ions ) @xcite , therefore @xmath109 , given the maximum growth rate ( see eqs.[eqn : cgl_alfven_speed ] and [ eqn : cgl_fastslow_speed ] ) :    @xmath110    with @xmath111 and @xmath112 for mirror and firehose instabilities , respectively .",
    "as we show further in this paper the firehose instability is of major interest in the amplification of @xmath90 , and we use @xmath113 from here .",
    "the scattering frequency can then be estimated as @xmath114 , and eq.[anisotropy2 ] becomes :    @xmath115      this problem is tractable analytically if we assume that the evolution of the firehose unstable regions in the plasma occur with constant @xmath91 .",
    "this approximation is justified by the fact that any process that may amplify the pressure anisotropy ( e.g. turbulence , anisotropic cosmic ray scattering , and others ) is precisely counterbalanced by the ones leading to isotropization .",
    "this is actually a probable scenario given that the increase of the pressure anisotropy by external sources is independent on @xmath91 , while the isotropization processes are a function of the anisotropy itself .",
    "therefore , the system should evolve around an `` equilibrium '' anisotropy value @xmath116 .",
    "if the relaxation timescale is short compared to the dynamical timescales of the system , we may assume @xmath117 .",
    "we must stress that the validity of such conjecture depends on the level of anisotropy itself , i.e. it is probably correct for @xmath118 and certainly does not stand for @xmath119 .",
    "let us first consider the case in which collisions dominate the isotropization of pressure .",
    "this limit could well describe the initial stages of the evolution of a cosmological seed field after the recombination era , given that @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field in this case depends mostly on the dynamics of the plasma , and not on instabilities driven by the pressure anisotropy .",
    "given that the resistive dissipation is extremely small in the intergalactic medium we may apply the `` frozen - in '' condition to the plasma .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field is then dominated by the turbulent rate of strain at the viscous scales ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath122    for @xmath123 and @xmath103 , and combined with eq.[dyn1 ] , eq.[anisotropy3 ] is then reduced to :    @xmath124 ) provides an exponential growth of the seed field up to equipartition at the smallest turbulent scales .",
    "however , as @xmath90 grows , @xmath125 and the plasma becomes gyrotropic .",
    "this is supposed to occur for extremely weak magnetic fields ( @xmath56 ) , possibly even earlier than the saturation of the turbulent dynamo at small scales .    another interesting aspect of the turbulence during the early evolutionary phase is to generate the pressure anisotropy by itself ( eq.[turbanis ] ) .",
    "this is physically understood as the consequence of a fast growth of the magnetic field not counterbalanced by collisions .",
    "depending on the properties of the turbulence , one obtains @xmath126 .",
    "such values are not expected in highly magnetized plasmas .",
    "once @xmath104 , due to the amplification of @xmath90 , the balance is reached since @xmath127 strongly depends on the magnetic field intensity .",
    "local measurements of the earth s magnetosphere and the solar wind reveal pressure anisotropies around its quasi - stability threshold @xmath128 , and many signatures of its role on the dynamical evolution of these systems have been found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the interesting implication of eq.[turbanis ] is that , due to its lower magnetization level ( much higher @xmath129 ) , @xmath130 in the igm / icm could have been much larger at higher redshits , compared to the values found presently in the solar system .",
    "once the magnetic field becomes strong enough , for the plasma to become gyrotropic , instabilities will take over the amplification of the magnetic field .",
    "now , as @xmath123 and @xmath104 , and replacing the cyclotron frequency @xmath131 , eq.[anisotropy3 ] becomes in our model can occur for firehose instability , i.e. @xmath132 ( see eq.[anisotropy ] ) , and therefore @xmath133 and @xmath134 :    @xmath135    which , at @xmath136 limit , result in a first order nonlinear ordinary differential equation with an analytical solution :    @xmath137    with @xmath138 .",

    "eq.[growthrate ] then provides an approximate timescale for the explosive growth of the magnetic field due to the collisionless plasma instability .",

    "a comparison between the spatial distributions of the density and velocity fields in cgl - mhd and standard mhd turbulent models have been provided in @xcite and @xcite . in those works",
    "it has been shown that cgl - mhd models , depending on the filling factor of unstable regimes and on the degree of pressure anisotropy itself , may lead to evident differences in the statistics of turbulent fields when compared to standard mhd turbulence .",
    "those studies were performed for relatively strong magnetic fields , i.e. for @xmath173 , and therefore the statistics of @xmath21 were weakly dependent on cgl - mhd instabilities ( see fig.6 in * ? ? ? * ) . differently to the previous works , we focused our modelling on the weakly magnetized turbulent regimes ( @xmath174 ) .              as the simulations are initiated , the driving of turbulence results in fluctuations of density , and of the velocity and magnetic fields , at different scales .",
    "it is well known for many decades that firehose and mirror instabilities , given the growth rate dependence with @xmath175 ( eqs.[eqn : cgl_alfven_speed ] and [ eqn : cgl_fastslow_speed ] ) , result in the emergence of structures much smaller than those observed in standard mhd turbulence @xcite . in standard mhd ,",
    "the forcing , i.e. the process of injection of turbulence , is the dominant dynamical process and therefore dominate the process of structure formation . in the collisionless plasma approximation ,",
    "on the other hand , the growth rate of the instabilities rises indefinitely with the wavenumber of the fluctuation , up to @xmath176 .",
    "the numerical scheme implemented in this work for solving the cgl - mhd equations do not account for finite larmor radius effects .",
    "therefore , the maximum growth rate of the instabilities must be related to the minimum lenghtscales of the system , which is the size of the finite volume of the space discretization , i.e. the grid cell .",
    "this means that both the growth rate and the geometry of the amplified magnetic fields are resolution dependent .    in figure [ fig_maps ]",
    "we present the aparent configuration of the magnetic field lines in the mid - slice ( in the z - direction ) .",
    "the geometry of the field lines is illustrated by the line integral convolution ( lic ) technique .",
    "the lic imaging algorithm consists of rendering a map of random streamlines that follow the orientation of the local field .",
    "the values are normalized to arbitrary units in order to provide a texture map .",
    "such texture map provides a visual qualitative measure for the scaling of the magnetic field lines .",
    "figure [ fig_maps ] shows the lic technique applied for the the magnetic field lines at saturated stage for @xmath177 and @xmath178 , corresponding to firehose unstable models , for the given resolutions of @xmath179 ( left ) , @xmath180 ( center ) and @xmath181 ( right ) .",
    "it is visually clear from these plots that the finer the resolution the more flocculent the geometry of the amplified magnetic field becomes .",
    "this result is expected since for @xmath177 and @xmath178 models the thermal pressure , including the pressure anisotropy free - energy , is much larger than the magnetic and turbulent driving energy densities .",
    "therefore the firehose instability dominates the plasma dynamics and the structure formation , which growth rate should peak around the smallest scales available in the system .",
    "this is also quantitatively measured by means of the normalized power spectrum of the magnetic field , shown in figure [ fig_spectra ] ( top ) .",
    "the three dimensional power spectra of the magnetic field for these models reveal that the peak shifts towards larger @xmath175 s as the numerical resolution increases .",
    "the peak shift is linear with the resolution , ocurring at rounded values of @xmath18216 , 33 and 65 , for resolutions of @xmath179 ( black ) , @xmath180 ( red ) and @xmath181 ( blue ) , respectively .",
    "perturbations smaller than @xmath183 grid cells suffer mostly the effects of numerical dissipation .",
    "notice that , theoretically , the maximum growth rate should occur at @xmath184 but numerical diffusion is responsible for the dissipation of coherent structures at the smallest scales . both the numerical viscosity and resistivity act together to reduce the effect of the instabilities in the growth of velocity and magnetic field perturbations . if the numerical viscosity is considered to be laplacian we can , in principle , estimate the peak location as the lengthscale at which the numerical viscous loss rate ( @xmath185 ) equals the instability grow rate , which results in @xmath186 . given that the asymptotic values of @xmath129 depends only on @xmath91 , when saturation of instabilities occurs the peak location becomes insensitive to @xmath187 , resulting in @xmath188 , i.e. approximately linearly proportional to the numerical resolution as suggested before .",
    "also , it is noticeable that the numerical resolution , except for the location of the peak , is not relevant for the general shape of the power spectrum of the magnetic field fluctuations . a power spectrum @xmath189 , with @xmath190 , is observed in the range of scales @xmath191 $ ] , in agreement with the saturation estimates for @xmath192 ( see section 3 ) , for all the numerical resolutions .",
    "this is a good indicative of convergence for the models .",
    "the obtained power spectrum is steeper than the one expected for the kinetic - phase of the small - scale dynamo , which shows that the instabilities are the dominant process in the field amplification here .",
    "this also show that the magnetic field at large scale is comparatively weaker .",
    "the effects of @xmath130 on the structure of the magnetic field is also shown in figure [ fig_spectra ] ( center ) . here",
    "we present the spatial spectral power of the magnetic field for the 5 different models with same thermal perpendicular pressure ( @xmath78 ) and numerical resolution ( @xmath180 ) , at @xmath193 , but for different parallel pressures ( @xmath79 ) , resulting in mirror ( `` m '' ) and firehose ( `` fh '' ) unstable systems with different anisotropies . the mirror unstable models , in contrast to the firehose unstable ones , present a decreasing power with wavenumber .",
    "this is because , as shown above , the amplification of the magnetic fluctuations in the firehose regime is dominated by the instabilities ( positive slope of the power spectra ) , while in the mirror unstable regions it is basically subject to the dynamics of the flow , i.e. the turbulence ( responsible for the negative slope of the power spectra ) . also , as we discuss in more details in the next subsection , the amplitude of the power spectrum is a function of the pressure anisotropy for the firehose unstable models , while it is insensitive to @xmath130 in the mirror unstable models . in the firehose case ,",
    "the larger the anisotropy the larger is the total power of the magnetic fluctuations , which is related to the real values of the fluctuations and to the degree of amplification itself .    since saturation is an important condition for the identification of the peak and total power of the magnetic fluctuations we studied the time evolution of the spatial power spectrum of @xmath21 of one of the firehose unstable models ( @xmath194,@xmath195 and @xmath180 ) .",
    "we chose the model with the smallest magnetic seed field given its longer saturation timescale , which could eventually influence the spectral power distribution .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig_spectra ] ( bottom ) , the spectra are very similar for all snapshots ( @xmath196 and @xmath197 ) , with exactly the same slopes and peak locations .",
    "this means that the saturation occurs at @xmath198 , and that the turbulence driven - even though super - alfvnic ( with respect to the seed field ) - is not able to modify the spatial distribution of the amplified field fluctuations .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that , since the non - linear regime ( as for the small - scale dynamo ) apparently does not exist , another mechanism is therefore required to continue the magnetic field amplification on larger scales .",
    "as indicated by the power spectra shown in fig.[fig_spectra ] , the firehose unstable models result in amplified magnetic field fluctuations . in the left panel of fig.[fig_anisotropy ]",
    "we present time evolution of the magnetic energy density for models with different pressure anisotropy ratios .",
    "the magnetic energy density was averaged over all grid cells of the simulated box .",
    "as mentioned above , the mirror unstable models show moderate growth rates for the magnetic field perturbations , which occur at timescales of @xmath199 , in agreement with a typical slow turbulent dynamo .",
    "the firehose unstable models on the other hand present much larger amplification values , corresponding to @xmath200 orders of magnitude for the three models shown .",
    "also , the amplification timescales are much shorter than in the mirror unstable case , with @xmath201 . for these models",
    "the saturation of magnetic energy density occurs at larger levels for larger pressure anisotropies , as expected for the saturation threshold @xmath202 ( see eq.[bevol ] ) . also , in qualitative agreement with eq.[growthrate ] , the saturation timescales for the magnetic field amplification decreases with pressure anisotropy .",
    "the timescales and amplification levels for saturation are also presented in table [ tab : sims ] .",
    "another interesting feature related to the time evolution of the magnetic energy density is the presence of a `` knee '' separating two different growth regimes .",
    "the energy density level of the knee is similar for all models . as pointed in section 3 , if the turbulent rate of strain is larger than the growth rate of the instabilities the turbulent dynamo regime dominates .",
    "this is precisely the physical motivation of the knee . at the early stages turbulence",
    "is driven at large scales , which are related to small growth rates of the instabilities . at this point eq.[dyn1 ] is not yet valid given that the turbulence is not fully evolved , but could be replaced with a reduced effective @xmath40 number instead due to the shorter inertial range .",
    "the actual magnetic growth rate , related to the rate of strain , increases with time as the cascade develops and the inertial range grows .",
    "this behavior is also observed in the curves of magnetic energy density evolution .",
    "once perturbations grow at a particular scale , at which the growth rate of the instabilities take over the numerical dissipation , the explosive amplification takes place .",
    "the right panel of fig.[fig_anisotropy ] presents the time evolution of the turbulent alfvnic mach number for the different models .",
    "all models start with similar turbulent strengths . from this",
    "it is clear that , for the cases with @xmath133 , the bulk of the magnetic field amplification is not related to the turbulence itself ( though it is needed to seed the fluctuations that are subject to the instabilities at a later stage ) .",
    "the mirror unstable models demonstrate very similar evolutions while , on the other hand , the firehose unstable models show different evolution depending on the level of pressure anisotropy . again , as pointed before , the larger the pressure anisotropy the faster the plasma reaches saturation .    the same study is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_resolution ] , but for the different numerical resolutions .",
    "we can observe that the evolution of the average magnetic energy density and the alfvnic mach number present similar profiles for the different models .",
    "therefore , the overall time dependency function of these quantities is well converged in our models .",
    "the convergence is good for the asymptotic value of the average magnetic energy density as well , which saturates for similar values regarless the resolution and depends on @xmath91 exclusively .",
    "the timescales for saturation however is resolution dependent , as we have pointed previously , being shorter for higher resolutions .",
    "this is in agreement to the fact that finer resolutions allow the growth of the shorter wavelength perturbations , which have faster growth rates .",
    "the effect of the seed field intensity on the magnetic growth rate is shown in fig.[fig_seed ] , for the models with @xmath203 and numerical resolution of @xmath180 cells . here",
    "the different seed field intensities correspond to initial thermal to magnetic pressure ratios @xmath204 ( red ) and @xmath205 ( black ) .",
    "the time evolution of the alfvnic mach number ( right panel ) shows that saturation occurs at similar levels regardless of the seed field intensity .",
    "the saturation occurs once instabilities drive the amplification to @xmath206 level , as predicted from the cgl - mhd stability condition .",
    "weaker initial magnetic fields result in later saturation timescales .",
    "the delay , compared to the models with stronger initial fields , occurs as the road up to the saturation level must take longer for weaker seed fields .",
    "notice that the  knees \" , i.e. the transition between the turbulent and instability driven dynamos , occur at similar times ( @xmath207 ) regardless the initial magnetic field intensity . also , the magnetic field amplification , relative to the seed field intensity , of the knee is similar in the three models .",
    "both features are in agreement to eq.[dyn1 ] .",
    "that equation reveals that , for the same timescales and similar turbulent properties , the relative amplification @xmath208 should be similar for all models .",
    "the time evolution of the minimum and maximum magnetic energy densities are also shown in the left panel of fig.[fig_seed ] , as dashed lines .",
    "these follow qualitatively the same profiles of the mean magnetic energy density , except for the short period before the `` knee '' , when the maximum energy increases while the minimum energy decreases with time .",
    "this process is due to the turbulence that increases the dispersion of the magnetic field distribution , before the growth of the instabilities .",
    "the second phase happens when the instability growth rate becomes more important than the turbulent rate of strain , therefore the `` knee '' occurs earlier for the maximum value curve ( larger rate of strain ) , and later for the minimum value curve ( lower rate of strain ) .",
    "the turbulent broadening of the magnetic energy density is clearly seen in the probability distribution function ( pdf ) shown in fig.[fig_pdfs ] . in the left panel",
    "we present the pdfs as they depend on the pressure anisotropy .",
    "we show the models with @xmath209 , @xmath180 resolution , for @xmath210 ( black ) , 25.0 ( red ) , 4.0 ( yellow ) , 0.25 ( green ) and 0.04 ( blue ) , all at @xmath197 .",
    "all models start with a delta function pdf , at @xmath211 .",
    "the broadening observed in the mirror unstable models exemplifies the role of the injected turbulence on the distribution of the magnetic energy over the simulated domain .",
    "there is clearly no net amplification of the averaged field intensity though .",
    "the firehose unstable models present pdfs that are shifted and skewed .",
    "not only the averaged field intensity is amplified , as discussed above , but these pdfs - as a whole - are shifted towards larger intensities , being the shift proportional to the pressure anisotropy .",
    "the skewness of the pdfs arises as their peaks are further shifted towards larger intensities , compared to the bulk of the distribution .",
    "this occurs if the amplification of the magnetic field is larger / faster for stronger fields .",
    "such behavior could be understood as a transient process due to the turbulent broadening , in which turbulence would naturally build - up strong field in more regions as time evolves , but this is not the case .",
    "the mirror unstable models do not present similar skewness . also , the time evolution of the pdfs do not support such possibility . in the right panel of fig.[fig_pdfs ]",
    "we show the time evolution of the pdf of magnetic field intensity for a single model . we have selected the model with @xmath179 resolution because it presents the slower evolution of the distribution , and the pdfs obtained at different snapshots",
    "can be compared . here",
    "we show four pdfs calculated at @xmath212 , 1.0 , 1.5 and @xmath197 .",
    "the general pdf profiles change slightly with time , but is similarly skewed from @xmath213 up to saturation time .",
    "the aparent constant skewness of these curves shows that the changes in the distribution of magnetic field intensity occurs too early to be accounted for the turbulence , and should be related to the instability itself .",
    "this is in agreement with eq.[bevol ] , which predicts faster amplification for stronger fields .",
    "obviously , any comparison between the simulations presented here and the magnetization of the intergalactic medium needs caution .",
    "the numerical simulations presented here correspond to full three - dimensional and stochastic numerical solutions of the problem .",
    "it represents a good benchmark for the analytical estimates ( and approximations related ) of the simplest zero - dimension , constant-@xmath91 , @xmath214 limit , derived in section 3 .",
    "we start analysing the dependency of the saturation timescale observed in the simulations with the pressure anisotropy ratio ( @xmath91 ) . in the top panel of fig.[fig : an_vs_num ] we present the values obtained from the simulations , as described in table [ tab : sims ] , together with a number of analytical solutions for comparison , as given by eq.[bevol ] .",
    "the triangles represent the three models with similar parameters except for the pressure anisotropy , therefore we fit the analytical solutions to these data .",
    "the squares correspond to the models with different initial conditions and are included for the sake of comparison only . here",
    "we also consider the fact that the simulated instabilities are slightly delayed by the fact that we do not initiate the models with fully developed turbulence . on the contrary",
    ", the initial configuration is that of an uniform magnetic field , which is disturbed as turbulence injected at large scale cascades .",
    "this turbulent delay ( @xmath215 ) is introduced as a free constant parameter , i.e. @xmath216 .",
    "overall there is reasonable agreement between the simulations and the analytical solutions , being those with @xmath217 particularly good .",
    "it is interesting to note that this range is similar to the timescales of the `` knees '' observed in fig.[fig_anisotropy ] .    in the lower panel of fig.[fig : an_vs_num ] the same study is presented but now for the initial values of the seed fields . here",
    "the triangles represent the three models with similar initial conditions except for the seed field ( @xmath218 , @xmath219 , and @xmath220 ) . according to eq.[growthrate ] ,",
    "the best fit to the data should occur for @xmath221 , with @xmath222 .",
    "however , as clearly seen from the plot , the best fits occur for a much weaker dependence ( or even no - dependence ) of @xmath223 with the initial seed field , being @xmath224 .",
    "the apparent discrepancy between the two results is not real though .",
    "notice that eq.[growthrate ] is derived as the magnetic field evolution once the condition @xmath104 is fulfilled .",
    "the term @xmath39 is therefore somewhat misleading in the sense that one must consider the magnetic field intensity once @xmath104 , i.e. a transition field intensity . for the analytical model the transition field intensity",
    "is determined by @xmath102 , while in the simulations by the numerical dissipation , i.e. in both cases it is insensitive to initial magnetic field .",
    "another major effect resposible for this discrepancy is that fact that the growthrate depends on the larmor radius , which can not be propely modelled in the simulations .",
    "naturally , @xmath223 obtained from the simulations is overestimated as @xmath90 increases with time .",
    "several authors have already discussed the effects of turbulence ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the lack of detection of tev radiation from blazars points towards the existence of amplified magnetic fields , with filling factors around 60% , even at the intergalactic medium voids @xcite .",
    "for this reason , turbulence - as a ubiquitous phenomenon - has been preferred as main mechanism for field amplification .",
    "the common problem related to turbulent models of collisonal plasmas is the typical timescale needed for magnetic field amplification . as explained",
    "previously the timescales associated to turbulent amplifications are too large for the magnetic seed amplitudes suggested so far .",
    "structure formation , on the other hand , would be dominant ( due to shear , compression or other star - formation related mechanisms ) in further amplification of the fields .    in this work",
    "we explore a possible scenario for magnetic field amplification at high redshits ( post - recombination ) , based on the growth of collisionless plasma instabilities .",

    "* ) , and the other purely numerical @xcite . in @xcite an analytical simplification of the problem",

    ", the numerical study presented here stands as an extension of that particular work but focused on the statistical properties of the magnetic field and the role of collisionless plasma instabilities on the amplification of the magnetic field .",
    "the scalings found for density and velocity fields in the firehose unstable models of that work resemble those obtained here for the magnetic field , with a power spectrum peak at the smallest scales available in the system .",
    "similar statistical properties were obtained by @xcite , who performed collisionless plasma simulation with variable pressure anisotropy and studied the statistical properties of the magnetic fields as well .",
    "the plasma properties were studied in a variable-@xmath91 framework though , with isotropization mechanisms being introduced _",
    "ad hoc_. still , it was shown that even in the cases where isotropization is strong enough to wash out the imprints of instabilities in the statistical properties of the plasma , their dynamical effects are important locally .",
    "the amplification of the magnetic field was studied and , as a consequence of small volume coverage of unstable regions , their general conclusion was that the instabilities were not efficient .",
    "differently to the assumption made in this work , their models do not include an external source term to excite the pressure anisotropy , which could - in principle - change the system to a quasi constant-@xmath91 case , similar to ours .    possible observational evidence ( or constraints ) for the process described in this work could be obtained from the cosmic microwave background .",
    "if collisionality condition was satisfied at pos - equipartition era , the magnetic field at small scales could have been amplified prior to the recombination era , and the ionization structure of the universe would be different , with effects on silk damping ( see * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , if the plasma becomes gyrotropic at @xmath231 , such effect would not be relevant .",
    "the main problem with the models mentioned above is the lack of a proper physical description of the isotropization of the particles momenta as the system evolves . differently to the previous works we consider the balance between pressure anisotropy sources and isotropization effects , which simplifies dramatically the solution of the problem and results in a problem that can be addressed both numerically and analytically .",
    "nature is obviously far more complex than a constant-@xmath91 model , but still any approximated model that can be studied by means of both analytical and numerical methods may be extremely usefulon the understanding of the basic dynamical properties related to the dynamics of collisionless plasma fluids .",
    "even if the amplification of the magnetic field , from seed fields up to equipartition levels , could be explained by the collisionless plasma instabilities , one must still consider its characteristic lenghtscale .",
    "the zero - dimensional anaytical models can not account for this properly .",
    "still , it is reasonable to consider the typical lengthscale to be that of maximum growth rate .",
    "indeed , from the numerical simulations presented in this work , it has been shown that the turbulent flows can not modify the magnetic field structure in timescales at which the amplification occurs .",
    "the spectral distribution of the magnetic field obtained from the simulations peak at the smallest scales possible , those at which the numerical dissipation overtakes the field growth .",
    "the finer the resolution the smaller is the characteristic lengthscale .    in the intergalactic medium this would be given by the natural process that can overtake the pressure anisotropy instabilities , particle collisions . with a typical mean free path of @xmath0 few kpc , one should expect the magnetic field energy to be concentrated in fluctuations with approximately this lengthscale .",
    "however , magnetic field correlation lengths as large as @xmath0mpc has been inferred from observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , posing the challenge not only on how to amplify the magnetic field but also on how to distribute the energy from the small to the large scales . in our firehose unstable cgl - mhd models",
    ", we obtained power spectra which are steeper than the expected for the kinetic phase of the small - scale dynamo .",
    "this demonstrates that the instabilities are indeed the dominant process in place in these models . on the other hand , depending on the level of pressure",
    "anisotropy it also results in weaker large scale fields , if compared to the ssd estimates .",
    "given that most of the energy of the magnetic fluctuations are placed at the smallest scale in the gyrotropic fluid approximation ( i.e. @xmath232 ) , one could estimate ( see section 3 ) the magnetic field intensity at large scales as @xmath233 . for @xmath234@xmath3 , @xmath235ev ,",
    "one finds @xmath236 g .",
    "the answer to this problem may be standing in the properties of the turbulence itself .",
    "as discussed earlier in this paper , turbulence stretches and folds the magnetic field in a process that drives the turbulent dynamo .",
    "this process is dominant at small scales , and is quenched in a given scale when the magnetic energy reaches equipartition with the turbulent one . in the collisionless plasma",
    "the instabilities are responsible for the growth of magnetic field at the small scales .",
    "even though turbulence can not stretch the field lines at the smallest scales it could , in principle , do it at the largest ones depending on its strength .",
    "this is clearly shown in figs.[fig_anisotropy ] , [ fig_resolution ] and [ fig_seed ] , where the evolution of the turbulent alfvnic mach number is always larger than unity , even after the saturation of the magnetic field .",
    "this because the velocity dispersion is dominanted by the large scale eddies , where equipartition was not reached . for these particular models ,",
    "the turbulence is responsible for transfering the magnetic field energy from small to large scales .",
    "this process should be even more important if the pressure anisotropy is quenched ( this is not the case of the simulations , in which we have kept it constant ) .",
    "the quenching of the pressure anisotropy , followed by the transfer of magnetic energy from small to large scales by super - alfvnic turbulence could therefore explain the observations .",
    "in other words , as shown in the numerical simulations , the cgl - mhd instabilities are presumably dominant over the kinematic phase of the small - scale dynamo , but possibly not for the later nonlinear phase ( once the instabilities are quenched ) .",
    "another possible solution for this problem would be related to the formation of large structures of matter ( e.g. massive galaxies , groups and clusters ) .",
    "it is quite clear now that the large scale magnetic field is not primordial , but has constantly evolved with the dynamical evolution of universe @xcite .",
    "this was also pointed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "references therein ) , in the context of small - scale fluctuations of weibel instability .",
    "the collapse of gas into galaxies or clusters @xcite , as well as large - scale shears , could in principle amplify coherent components of the magnetic field .",
    "if correct , in such scenario magnetic energy would have been provided dominantly at small scales , in the post - recombination era , but reasembled into large scale coherent structures ( @xmath237kpc ) following the recent structure formation of the dark and baryonic matter ( @xmath238 ) .",
    "in this work we studied the magnetic field amplification process in turbulent collisionless plasmas . in such plasmas , parallel and perpendicular pressures",
    "( with respect to the local magnetic field ) may become so anisotropic that instabilities may become dynamically important .",
    "it has been pointed in previous analytical models that such instabilities , acting together with a turbulent background , may accelerate the amplification of the magnetic field up to near equipartition levels . such models would then have dramatic implications on our understanding of the magnetization of the early universe ( post - recombination ) , given that the intergalactic medium then becomes collisionless .",
    "these models provide timescales and saturation estimates for the magnetic energy density , but have never been confronted by full three - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "the aims of this work were to revisit the analytical zero - dimensional models of the magnetic field evolution in turbulent collisionless plasmas and to provide a number of full three - dimensional numerical simulations that could be directly compared to these analytical estimates .    as long as pressure anisotropy",
    "is kept constant during the evolution of the system a novel analytical solution is provided for the magnetic field evolution in systems subject to firehose instability . as discussed before , such assumption is not too far from reality , given that different processes act together to increase and decrease pressure anisotropy , and some sort of equilibrium value for @xmath91 , in unstable regime , may exist ( specially for weakly magnetized plasmas ) .",
    "we find that :    * for very weak initial seed fields , the early evolution of the magnetic field is dominated by collisions , and the turbulent dynamo should be responsible for the initial amplification of the field ; * once the field grows and @xmath239 , a transition from an isotropic to a gyrotropic plasma occurs and instabilities would then be driven .",
    "a fraction of the `` free - energy '' available ( @xmath240 ) would then be transfered to the magnetic field as the system evolves , up to saturation ; * saturation occurs at @xmath141 value , which is reached in a timescale @xmath241 , with @xmath144 or @xmath145 , for @xmath146 and @xmath242 , respectively .",
    "this analytical model was then compared to a number of cgl - mhd numerical simulations , with different initial and turbulent conditions , from which the evolution of the magnetic field from the seed field , up to saturation , was followed .",
    "the main results obtained are as follows :    * the explosive growth of magnetic field energy density is observed in the firehose unstable models , being the amplification timescales approximately proportional to @xmath243 , as was predicted in the simple analytical model ; * there is no clear dependency between @xmath223 and @xmath39 in the simulations , in contradiction to the linear anti - correlation derived in the analytical model .",
    "this is explained in terms of @xmath39 being the field intensity at @xmath244 transition , rather than the initial seed value .",
    "also , because the code is unable of evolving the larmor frequency as a function of @xmath90 ; * the power spectrum of the magnetic field peaks at the smalles scales not dominated by the numerical diffusion , and the transfer of energy to large scales must occur aftewards , by turbulence itself , once saturation occurs .",

    "<S> in this work we report a numerical study of the cosmic magnetic field amplification due to collisionless plasma instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the collisionless magnetohydrodynamic equations derived account for the pressure anisotropy that leads , in specific conditions , to the firehose and mirror instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we study the time evolution of seed fields in turbulence under the influence of such instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> an approximate analytical time evolution of magnetic field is provided . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical simulations and the analytical predictions are compared . </S>",
    "<S> we found that i ) amplification of magnetic field was efficient in firehose unstable turbulent regimes , but not in the mirror unstable models , ii ) the growth rate of the magnetic energy density is much faster than the turbulent dynamo , iii ) the efficient amplification occurs at small scales . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical prediction for the correlation between the growth timescales with pressure anisotropy ratio is confirmed by the numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these results reinforce the idea that pressure anisotropies - driven naturally in a turbulent collisionless medium , e.g. the intergalactic medium - , could efficiently amplify the magnetic field in the early universe ( post - recombination era ) , previous to the collapse of the first large - scale gravitational structures . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism , though fast for the small scale fields ( @xmath0kpc scales ) , is however unable to provide relatively strong magnetic fields at large scales . </S>",
    "<S> other mechanisms that were not accounted here ( e.g. , collisional turbulence once instabilities are quenched , velocity shear , or gravitationally induced inflows of gas into galaxies and clusters ) could operate afterwards to build up large scale coherent field structures in the long time evolution . </S>"
