    "the emergency of collective behavior among coupled oscillators is a rather common phenomenon . in nature ,",
    "one typically finds interacting chaotic oscillators which through the coupling scheme form small and large networks .",
    "surprisingly , even though chaotic systems possess an exponential divergency of nearby trajectories , they can synchronize due to the coupling , still preserving the chaotic behavior@xcite .",
    "indeed , synchronization phenomena have been found in a variety of fields as ecology @xcite , neuroscience @xcite , economy @xcite , and lasers @xcite .    in the last years some types of synchronization",
    "have been reported @xcite .",
    "a rather interesting kind is a weak synchronization , namely phase synchronization ( ps ) , that does not reveal itself directly from the trajectory , but as a boundedness of phase difference between the interacting oscillators .",
    "in such a synchronization the trajectories can be uncorrelated , and therefore , the oscillators present some independence of the amplitudes , but still preserving the collective behavior",
    ".    this phenomenon can arise from a very small coupling strength @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that it mediates processes of information transmission and collective behavior in neural and active networks @xcite , and communication processes in the human brain @xcite .",
    "its presence has been found in a variety of experimental systems , such as in electronic circuits @xcite , in electrochemical oscillators @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , and climatology @xcite .    in order to state the existence of ps",
    ", one has to introduce a phase @xmath0 for the chaotic oscillator , what is not straightforward .",
    "even though the phase is expected to exist to a general attractor , due to the existence of the zero lyapunov exponent @xcite , its explicit calculation may be impossible .",
    "actually , even for the simple case of coherent attractors , it has been shown that phases can be defined in different ways , each one being chosen according to the particular case studied .",
    "however , all of them agree for sufficiently coherent attractors @xcite .    in spite of the large interest in this field , there is still no general , systematic , and easy way to detect the existence of this phenomenon , mainly , due to the fact that the phase is rather difficult ( often unknown ) to calculate .",
    "the calculation becomes even harder if the oscillators are non - coherent , e.g. the funnel oscillator @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to present a general approach to detect ps , with practical applications , we must overcome the need of a phase .    in many cases",
    "the phase can be estimated via the hilbert transformation or a wavelet decomposition @xcite .",
    "supposing that it is possible to get a phase , the approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite gives rather good results .",
    "it is grounded on the idea of conditional observations of the oscillators . whenever the phase of one of the oscillators is increased by @xmath1",
    ", we measure the phase of the other oscillators .",
    "the main idea is that if one has ps , the distribution of these conditional observation in the phase presents a sharp peak , and therefore ps can be detected .",
    "there are a few approaches that try to overcome the difficulties of not having a general phase . for periodically driven oscillators",
    ", there is an interesting approach , very useful and easy to implement that overcomes the need of a phase , the stroboscopic map technique .",
    "it consists in sampling the chaotic trajectory at times @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an integer and @xmath4 is the period of the driver .",
    "the stroboscopic map was used to detect ps @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that if the stroboscopic map is localized in the attractor , ps is present .",
    "actually , the stroboscopic map is a particular case of the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite . indeed ,",
    "since the driver is periodic , the observation of the trajectory of the chaotic oscillators at times @xmath2 is equivalent to observe the oscillators at every increasing of @xmath1 in the phase of the driver . furthermore , if the chaotic oscillator presents a sharp conditional distribution , this means that the stroboscopic map is localized .",
    "the advantage of such an approach is that it does not require the introduction of a phase neither in the periodic oscillator nor in the chaotic one .    in the case of two or more coupled chaotic oscillators , namely @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the stroboscopic map techniques can be no longer applied .",
    "however , if the oscillators are coherent and have a proper rotation , a generalization of the stroboscopic map has been recently developed @xcite . instead of observing the oscillators at fixed time intervals , multiples of the period , one can define a poincar section in @xmath5 and then observe @xmath6 every time the trajectory of @xmath5 crosses the poincar section . if the oscillators are in ps , these observations give place to a localized set .",
    "another approach that is relevant to the present problem is the one developed in ref .",
    "this approach consists of defining a point @xmath7 and a small neighborhood of this point composed by points @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the number of points within the defined neighborhood .",
    "then , one observes the oscillator @xmath6 at the times @xmath11 , which gives place to the points @xmath12 .",
    "again , the idea is that if the oscillators present synchronization , the cloud of points @xmath13 occupies an area much smaller than the attractor area .",
    "further , estimators have been introduced to quantify the amount of synchronization @xcite .    even though the intuition says that localized set implies the presence of synchronization ,",
    "there is a lack of theoretical analysis showing such a result for a general oscillator .",
    "moreover , as far as we know , there are no results that guarantee that such an approach works for multiple time - scale oscillators . in addition , it is not clear what kind of points ( events ) could be chosen , and finally , how one should proceed in the case that the small neighborhood of the point @xmath14 has infinitely many neighbor points .    in this work ,",
    "we extent the ideas of ref . @xcite .",
    "we show that all these approaches can be put in the framework of localized sets .",
    "our results demonstrate that for general coupled oscillators @xmath5 and @xmath6 , if one defines a typical event in @xmath5 and then observes the oscillator @xmath6 whenever this event occurs , these observations give rise to a localized set in the accessible phase space if ps exists .",
    "these results can be applied to oscillators that possess multiple time - scales as well as in neural networks . as an application",
    ", we analyze the onset of ps in neural networks .",
    "we show that in general neural networks one should expect to find clusters of phase synchronized neurons that can be used to transmit information in a multiplexing and multichannel way .",
    "finally , we relate the localized sets from our theory to the information exchange between the coupled chaotic oscillators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ setup ] we define the dynamical systems we are working on . in sec .",
    "[ localized ] we give a result that enables the identification of ps without having to measure the phase .",
    "we illustrate these findings with two coupled rssler oscillators in sec .",
    "[ ross ] . for oscillators possessing multiple time - scales",
    "our main results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ timescales ] , and then illustrated in sec .",
    "[ neus ] for bursting neurons coupled via inhibitory synapses .",
    "our results are also applied to neural networks of excitatory neurons in sec .",
    "we briefly discuss how to apply these ideas into high dimension oscillators and experimental data series in sec .",
    "finally , we analyze the relation between the localized sets and the transmission of information in chaotic oscillators in sec .",
    "moreover , in appendix [ proof ] we prove the main theorem of sec . [ localized ] about the localization of sets in ps .",
    "we consider @xmath10 oscillators given by first order coupled differential equations : @xmath15 where , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the output vector function , and @xmath19 is the coupling strength between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "note that @xmath19 could also depend on the coordinates and on time . from now on , we shall label the coupled oscillator @xmath22 by subsystem @xmath23 .",
    "next , we assume that each @xmath5 has a stable attractor , i.e. an inflowing region of the phase space where the solution of @xmath5 lies .",
    "further , we assume that the subsystem @xmath5 admits a phase @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the condition for ps between the oscillators @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be written as : @xmath25 where @xmath3 and @xmath26 are integers , and the inequality must hold for all times , with @xmath27 being a finite number . for a sake of simplicity , we consider the case where @xmath28 , in other words @xmath29 ps . herein , we suppose that a frequency @xmath30 can be defined in each subsystem @xmath5 , such that : @xmath31 where @xmath30 is a continuous function bounded away from zero .",
    "furthermore there is a number @xmath32 such that @xmath33 .",
    "this phase is an abstract phase in the sense that it is well defined , but we are not able to write the function @xmath30 for a general oscillator .",
    "we also consider the frequencies @xmath34 not to be too different , such that , in general , through the coupling ps can be achieved .",
    "in this section we present our main result . the basic idea",
    "consists in the following : given two subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath5 , we observe @xmath6 whenever an event in the oscillator @xmath5 happens . as a consequence of these conditional observations , we get a set @xmath35 . depending on the properties of this set one can state whether there is ps .",
    "the conditional observations could be given by a poincar section , if it is possible to define a poincar section with the property that the trajectory crosses it once per cycle in a given direction .",
    "we wish to point out that in this case , one is able to have more information about the dynamics and the phase synchronization phenomenon . as an example , one can introduce a phase , and estimate the average frequency of the oscillators .",
    "however , these techniques based on the poincar section @xcite can not be applied to attractors without a proper rotation , where such a section can not be well defined .    our main result",
    "overcomes the need of a poincar section . we show that one can use any typical event to detect ps .",
    "such events may be the crossing of the trajectory with a small piece of a poincar section ( when it is possible to defined such a section ) , the crossing of the trajectory with an arbitrary small segment , the entrance of the trajectory in an @xmath36-ball , and so on .",
    "the only constraint is that the event must be typical ( we shall clarify what we mean by typical , later on ) and the region where the event is defined must have a positive measure",
    ". let @xmath37 be the time at which the @xmath21th event in the subsystem @xmath38 happens .",
    "then , we construct the set : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the initial point within the attractor of @xmath6 .",
    "next , we define what we understand by localized set .",
    "let @xmath41 be a subset of @xmath42 .",
    "the set @xmath41 is localized in @xmath42 if there is a cross section @xmath43 and a neighborhood @xmath44 of @xmath43 such that @xmath45 [ loc ]    an illustration of the definition is given in fig .",
    "[ defi ] .    under the assumptions of sec .",
    "[ setup ] , the following result connects the existence of phase synchronization with the localization of sets the @xmath46 :    given a typical event , with positive measure , in the oscillator @xmath5 , generating the times @xmath47 .",
    "the observation of @xmath6 at @xmath47 generates a localized set @xmath35 if there is ps .",
    "this result constitutes a direct generalization of approaches of refs .",
    "@xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "this result shed a light into the problem of ps detection , which turned out to be a rather difficult task , depending on the system faced .",
    "therefore , ps can be detected in real - time experiments and in data analysis by verifying whether the sets @xmath46 are localized , without needing any further calculations .      in this section",
    "we investigate the mechanism for the non localization of the sets @xmath46 .",
    "we let the event definition be an entrance in an @xmath36-ball in both subsystems , with @xmath36 being the radius . when @xmath36 is small enough",
    ", we can demonstrate that ps leads to the locking of all unstable periodic orbits ( upo ) between the subsystems .    if the set @xmath35 is localized , then all upos between @xmath6 and @xmath5 are locked .",
    "* proof : * we demonstrate this result by absurd .",
    "let us assume that there is ps ; as a consequence the set @xmath35 is localized .",
    "suppose that there is an upo , regarded as @xmath48 in @xmath5 , and another upo , regarded as @xmath49 in @xmath6 , and that they are not locked ( there is no rational number that relates both frequencies ) .",
    "so , there is a mismatch between the frequencies of the two upos . given an @xmath50-ball around @xmath51 ( resp .",
    "@xmath52 ) , where @xmath53 ( resp .",
    "@xmath54 ) , any point @xmath55 distant @xmath56 from @xmath51 , where @xmath57 , follows @xmath58 \\le \\varepsilon_j$ ] , for any @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the largest eigenvalue associated with the orbit @xmath48 , and @xmath61 $ ] is a metric .",
    "an initial condition inside the @xmath56-ball is governed by the upo @xmath48 till a time @xmath62 , see fig .",
    "[ upo ] for an illustration .",
    "next , we construct the set @xmath35 by sampling the trajectory of @xmath6 whenever the trajectory @xmath5 enters in the @xmath36-ball , which is equivalent to observe @xmath6 every period of the upo @xmath48 . there is an one - to - one correspondence ( isomorphism ) between the dynamics of the conditional observations and the dynamics of the irrational rotation in the unitary circle , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the frequency mismatch between the two upos , here given by : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the angular frequency of @xmath68 .",
    "this means that the points of @xmath35 will be dense around the upo @xmath49 , and therefore , the set @xmath35 is not localized ; there is no ps , what contradict our assumption . indeed , since @xmath69 , it is impossible to bound the phase difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 by a finite number .",
    "thus , in order to have localized sets @xmath46 , all upos must be locked.@xmath70    this shows that the mechanism for the non - localization of the sets @xmath46 will be the existence of unlocked upos between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "similar results have been pursued for periodically driven oscillators , @xcite .",
    "right at the desynchronization some upos become unlocked and the stroboscopic map becomes non - localized , and some phase slips happen , generating an intermittent behavior .",
    "the duration of the phase slips are related to the number of unlocked upos .",
    "of course , in this regime the set @xmath46 is a non - localized set . however , if one looks for finite time intervals the set @xmath46 may be apparently localized .",
    "we first illustrate this result for two coupled rssler oscillators , given by : @xmath71 with @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "in such a coherent oscillator , we can simply define a phase @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , which provides an explicity equation for it .",
    "indeed , taking the derivative with respect to time : @xmath76 which can be written as @xmath77 , which provides : @xmath78 noting that @xmath79 . in a more compact notation",
    ", we consider @xmath80 , then eq . ( [ phase ] ) can be written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 represents the vectorial product .",
    "equation ( [ ph ] ) can be used to calculate the phase of the oscillators @xmath23 , and there is ps if @xmath83 remains bounded as @xmath84 .    in order to apply our results",
    "we may define an event occurrence in both oscillators .",
    "we define the event in oscillator @xmath85 to be the trajectory crossing with the segment : @xmath86 the crossings generate the times @xmath87 .",
    "the event in the oscillator @xmath88 happens whenever its trajectory crosses the segment : @xmath89 the crossings generates the times @xmath90 .",
    "then , the set @xmath91 is constructed by observing the oscillators @xmath92 at times @xmath93    for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , the set @xmath96 spreads over the attractor of @xmath85 [ fig [ event ] ( a ) ] , and @xmath97 spreads over the attractor of @xmath88 [ fig . [ event](b ) ] .",
    "therefore , there is no ps , i.e. the phase difference @xmath98 diverges [ fig [ event ] ( e ) ] .",
    "indeed , a calculation of the frequencies shows that @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "as we increase the coupling , ps appears . in particular , for @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the sets @xmath96 and @xmath97 are localized [ figs [ event ] ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively ] .",
    "hence , the phase difference is bounded [ fig . [ event](f ) ] .",
    "the average frequency is @xmath103 .",
    "our main goal is to state the existence of ps , however , we can also estimate the synchronization level between @xmath5 and @xmath6 by means of the localized sets .",
    "this can be done by introducing an estimator @xmath104 .",
    "one way to estimate the amount of synchrony is to define : @xmath105 where vol denotes the volume @xcite .",
    "if there is no ps , the set @xmath41 spreads over the attractor of @xmath5 , see fig .",
    "[ event](a , b ) , then , @xmath106 . as the oscillators undergo a transition to ps , @xmath104 becomes smaller than @xmath107 .",
    "the lower @xmath104 is the stronger the synchronization level is @xcite .    for attractors with the same topology as the rssler oscillator , @xmath104 can be easily calculated . instead of computing the volume",
    ", we calculate the area occupied by the attractor in the plane @xmath108 .",
    "the area @xmath109 of the attractor of @xmath5 can be roughly estimated by the area of the disk with radii @xmath110 and @xmath111 , see fig .",
    "thus , @xmath112 . on the other hand ,",
    "the set @xmath5 is confined into an angle @xmath113 [ fig .",
    "[ hjk ] ] .",
    "therefore , the area of the set @xmath41 can be estimated as @xmath114 .",
    "thus , the estimator can be written as : @xmath115    we have used eq .",
    "( [ est_h ] ) to estimate the amount of synchronization between the two coupled rssler of eq .",
    "( [ rossler ] ) .",
    "we fix @xmath116 and vary the mismatch parameter @xmath117 within the interval @xmath118 $ ] . for @xmath119 the coupled rsslers phase synchronize , which means that the set @xmath41 is localized .",
    "therefore , @xmath120 .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath121 is the more localized the set @xmath41 becomes , meaning that the oscillators are more synchronized , leading @xmath104 to low values . at @xmath122",
    "the two coupled oscillators present their strongest synchronization with @xmath123 .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ hjk_results ] .",
    "in oscillators with only one time - scale , i.e. one typical period , a typical event means an event possible to realize , thus with positive measure . in oscillators with multiple time - scales , i.e. oscillators that possess more than one typical period ( an oscillator with a fast and slow variables )",
    ", a typical event means an event that takes into account all time - scales .",
    "conversely , an atypical event is the one that takes into account just a few time - scales , e.g. only one . in such an oscillator with multiple time - scales ,",
    "one may have synchronization only in one time scale , while the others may be asynchronous .",
    "if the event definition excludes completely the dynamics of the synchronized time - scale this event is atypical and one does not observe localized sets through it . in order to clarify these ideas , we consider two instructive examples .",
    "let us consider a quasi - periodic motion on a torus @xmath124 with two independent frequencies @xmath125 and @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath126 @xmath127 .",
    "the dynamics on the torus @xmath128 can be characterized by the angular variables and the flow takes the form @xmath129 .",
    "furthermore , we consider another oscillator on a quasi - periodic torus with two independent frequencies @xmath125 and @xmath130 , the flow @xmath131 , in angular variables , takes the form @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , under this construction one sees ps in only one time - scale , since @xmath133 are independent .",
    "if we consider the event in the oscillator @xmath6 to be the increasing of @xmath1 on the variable @xmath134 , conversely the crossing in the section @xmath135 , it generates the times @xmath136 .",
    "the observation of @xmath5 at these times generates a localized set @xmath41 , which will lay on @xmath137 , a subset of @xmath138 , and will never occupy the full space . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the event in the oscillator @xmath5 to be the increasing of @xmath139 on the variable @xmath140 , conversely the crossing with the section @xmath141 , the set @xmath35 will not be localized , since @xmath133 and @xmath125 are independent .",
    "therefore , one must define an event that captures the dynamics of the synchronized time scale . in the pictorial example of fig .",
    "[ toru ] any other piece of section that is a linear combination of @xmath135 and @xmath141 provides typical events .",
    "an interesting situation is when the time scales present a relationship , which is the case for spiking / bursting oscillators .",
    "consider two spiking / bursting neurons @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "they have distinct time - scales , the bursting scale , with low frequencies , and the spiking scale , with high frequencies .",
    "the spiking scale consists of the action potentials @xcite which occur due to the exchange of ions like @xmath144 of the external media with the neuron . on the other hand ,",
    "the neuron may also exchange slow current like @xmath145 which inhibits the occurrence of spikes generating the bursts .",
    "an event defined by the occurrence of a burst defines simultaneously the beginning and the ending of a spike train .",
    "therefore , even though spikes and bursts may have independent frequencies , the burst occurrence is also determined by the occurrence of the first and last spike within the burst .",
    "it has been reported that it is possible to have ps in the bursting scale while the spiking scale is not synchronized @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to analyze the existence of synchronization between the neurons , by means of standard techniques , the spiking and bursting scales must be separately analyzed .",
    "our method detects ps independently on the time - scale that the event is defined ; if one time - scale is synchronous one finds localized @xmath46 sets . in order to illustrate this result",
    "we may take the following example .",
    "assume that the bursting scales are strongly synchronized .",
    "this means that if neuron @xmath142 ends the @xmath21th burst at a time @xmath146 , the neuron @xmath143 ends the @xmath21th burst at a time @xmath147 , where @xmath148 .",
    "next , consider that within any burst in neuron @xmath142 there are always two spikes equidistant in time .",
    "let us denote @xmath149 the time at which the @xmath3th spike occurs in @xmath142 . in neuron @xmath143",
    "there are two spikes within a burst and with a probability @xmath150 a third spike may occur [ fig .",
    "[ exemplo](a ) ] .",
    "under this construction , it is clear that the spiking scales are not synchronized .",
    "we can verify this by applying the same approach as in refs .",
    "we define a threshold for the burst occurrence , the dot gray line in fig .",
    "[ exemplo](a ) .",
    "then for every burst we assume that the phase @xmath151 is increased by @xmath1 and between two bursts the phase increases linearly .",
    "so , the phase for the neuron @xmath143 can be written as : @xmath152 a similar equation can be written for @xmath142 . note only that at a time @xmath153 , the neuron @xmath142 may present @xmath26 bursts .",
    "so , the phase difference @xmath154 is equal to @xmath155 . now bringing the fact that @xmath156",
    ", we have @xmath157 therefore , the phase difference is bounded . on the spiking scale",
    "the situation is different ; there is no synchronization .",
    "doing the same procedure , we introduce a phase @xmath158 that is increased by @xmath1 between two successive spikes .",
    "thus , the phase for the neuron @xmath143 can be written as : @xmath159 a naive computation in the limit @xmath160 shows that @xmath161 .",
    "hence , there is , of course , no synchronization on the spiking scale .",
    "next , we construct the set @xmath41 observing the neuron @xmath142 every time that an event happens in the neuron @xmath143 .",
    "first , we fix the event to be the ending of a burst , see fig . [",
    "exemplo](a ) .",
    "as we observe @xmath142 at @xmath162 all the points of @xmath41 will be close to the end of the burst .",
    "so , the set @xmath41 does not spread over the attractor , see the gray points in fig . [",
    "exemplo](b ) .",
    "however , the set @xmath41 is also localized even if we set the event to be the occurrence of a spike .",
    "since the spikes always occur within a burst , even though the spikes themselves are not synchronized , the trajectory related to the hyperpolarization period will not the visited , and therefore , the set @xmath41 will be localized , see the black balls in fig .",
    "[ exemplo](b ) .",
    "next , we study the appearance of ps between two spiking / bursting neurons of the hindmarsh - rose ( hr ) type . in such an oscillator",
    "the introduction of a phase is rather difficult , since the neurons are non - coherent .",
    "we couple the neurons via inhibitory synapses , which introduces non - coherence in both time - scales .",
    "this happens because when one neuron spikes it inhibits the other neuron , which hyperpolarizes , but the neuron that has been inhibited still tries to spike .",
    "this competition generates even more non - coherence in both time - scales .",
    "therefore , we consider this model as a proper example to illustrate our results .    in the 4-dimensional hr model @xcite neurons are described by a set of four coupled differential equations : @xmath163 where @xmath164 represents the membrane potential of the neuron @xmath143 , @xmath165 is associated with fast currents exchange and @xmath166 with slow currents dynamics , @xmath167 is the synaptic input vector and @xmath168 is the synaptic current that neurons @xmath142 ( post - synaptic ) injects in @xmath143 ( pre - synaptic ) , and @xmath169 is the @xmath170 connectivity matrix where @xmath171 if neuron @xmath142 is connected to neuron @xmath143 , and @xmath172 , otherwise , with @xmath173 .",
    "this model has been shown to be realistic , since it reproduces the membrane potential of biological neurons @xcite , and it is able to replace a biological neuron in a damaged biological network , restoring its natural functional activity @xcite .",
    "it also reproduces a series of collective behaviors observed in a living neural network @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the model are the same as in ref .",

    "we change @xmath174 in order to obtain a spiking / bursting behavior and we use it as a mismatch parameter .",

    "we shall analyze two situations : when the event is defined in the bursting scale , and when the event is defined in the spiking scale .",
    "firstly , we define the @xmath21th event to be the @xmath21th crossing of the membrane potential of the neuron @xmath187 with the threshold @xmath188 in an upwards direction .",
    "we denote the time events by @xmath189 .",
    "note that this threshold assigns to the times @xmath189 the beginning of the @xmath21th burst of @xmath187 .",
    "[ ps - set](a ) shows the time series of the membrane potential of the neurons @xmath187 .",
    "the threshold @xmath188 is depicted with the dashed line , and it is chosen in such a way that it does not define a proper poincar section , which means that not all the bursts cross it , see fig [ ps - set](a ) . actually many bursts are missed .",
    "thus , the approach to extract the phase considering the increasing of @xmath190 between two bursts , misleads the statement of ps .",
    "that is so , because in this approach the phase is threshold dependent .",
    "therefore , by using eq .",
    "( [ pb ] ) , we get that ps does not exist , which is crucially wrong ( note that , with the increasing of the threshold value ps would appear )",
    ". however , our approach , which is not threshold dependent , overcomes these difficulties .",
    "indeed , localized sets exist even for this threshold [ fig [ ps - set](b ) ] .",
    "conversely , if we increase the threshold level in such a way that it takes into account the spike occurrence , e.g. a threshold at @xmath191 , the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ ps - set](c ) , the former approach , as in eq .",
    "( [ spike ] ) , completely fails to state ps , due to the fact that the spikes are not in ps .",
    "furthermore , the spikes are highly non - coherent .",
    "the competition between the two neurons generates a damping in the spikes in the beginning of the burst , followed by an increasing and then decreasing in the spike frequency [ fig .",
    "[ ps - set](c ) ] .",
    "again , since the threshold @xmath192 defines a typical event , the observation of @xmath187 at times @xmath37 provides localized sets @xmath46 [ fig .",
    "[ ps - set](d ) ] .",
    "the ideas introduced herein are also useful to analyze the onset of synchronization in networks .",
    "we consider a network of @xmath193 non - identical hr neurons , regarded as @xmath194 where @xmath195 $ ] , connected via excitatory chemical synapses .",
    "the mismatch parameter is the intrinsic current @xmath196 .",
    "since the meaningful parameter is @xmath197 , for which the hr neuron best mimics biological neurons , we introduce mismatches around this value for all the neurons within the network .",
    "thus , given a random number @xmath198 uniformly distributed within the interval @xmath199 $ ] , we set @xmath200 .",
    "the excitatory synapses are modeled by eqs . ( 18 ) and ( [ s2 ] ) . to obtain the excitatory effect we change the value of @xmath180 . if @xmath201 , the pre - synaptic neuron always injects a positive current in the post - synaptic one .",
    "since the maximum spike amplitude is around @xmath202 , we set @xmath203 .",
    "our network is a homogeneous random network , i.e. all neurons receive the same number @xmath204 of connections , namely @xmath205 , see fig . [ nets](a ) .",
    "we constrain @xmath206 [ see eq .",
    "( 17 ) ] to be equal to all neurons .",
    "we identify the amount of phase synchronous neurons by analyzing whether the sets @xmath207 are localized .",
    "the onset of ps in the whole network takes place at @xmath208 ; so all neurons become phase synchronized . as the synapse strength crosses another threshold , @xmath209 ,",
    "the neurons undergo a transition to the rest state no longer presenting an oscillatory behavior .",
    "clusters of ps appear for @xmath210 .",
    "in fact , right at @xmath211 , some ps clusters appear [ fig .",
    "[ var_cluster](a ) ] .",
    "again , the clusters are identified by analyzing the localized sets .",
    "these clusters seem to be robust under small perturbations .",
    "clusters of ps inside the network may offer a suitable environment for information exchanging .",
    "each one can be regarded as a channel of communication , since they possess different frequencies , each channel of communication operates in different bandwidths .",
    "to see the bandwidths in the network , we analyze the variance in the average bursting time of the neurons .",
    "since only the burst scale is synchronized , we are just interested in the average bursting time , which can be straightforwardly estimated with a fast fourier transformation fft @xcite .",
    "so , given the neuron @xmath142 , we label its bursting average time by @xmath212 . then , we compute the variance of the average time on the ensemble of neurons . for this , we first introduce the average time of the whole network , which is given by : @xmath213 thus , the variance of the average time on the ensemble of neurons is readily written as : @xmath214 so , @xmath215 indicates how diverse are the bandwidths .",
    "as one can see in fig [ var_cluster](b ) , when the first clusters appear for @xmath216 , we have @xmath217 indicating that the whole network is working almost with the same frequency . a further increasing of @xmath206 causes the destruction of these clusters and an increasing of @xmath215 .",
    "however , even in the regimes of high @xmath215 with @xmath218 $ ] , there is the formation of clusters .",
    "this scenario of cluster formation is neither restricted to this hr model nor to the synapse model .",
    "it can also be found in square - wave and parabolic bursters , and it is in general achieved quite before the onset of complete synchronization .",
    "for example , we use a more simplified hr model given by : @xmath219 , with the parameters : @xmath220 ; @xmath221 being the connectivity matrix and @xmath222 a fast threshold modulation as synaptic input given by @xmath223,\\ ] ] with @xmath224 and @xmath225 . as before , @xmath226 is the synaptic strength and the reversal potential @xmath227 in order to have an excitatory synapse . for a homogeneous random network of @xmath228 identical hr neurons , with @xmath229 [ fig . [",
    "nets](b ) ] , the theory developed in ref .",
    "@xcite predicts the onset of complete synchronization at @xmath230 , while we found that ps in the whole network is already achieved at @xmath231 .",
    "clusters of ps , however , appear for a much smaller value of the coupling strength , actually at @xmath232 .",
    "next , we apply the same procedure as before and we compute the variance of the average bursting time on the ensemble of neurons within the network .",
    "the result @xmath233 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ hasler_ps ] , the inset numbers indicate the amount of clusters .    as we have pointed out ,",
    "such clusters are rather suitable for communication exchanging mainly for two reasons : @xmath234 they have different frequencies , therefore , each cluster may be used to transmit information in a particular bandwidth , which may provide a multiplexing processing of information . @xmath235",
    "the clusters of phase synchronous neurons provide a multichannel communication , that is , one can integrate a large number of neurons ( chaotic oscillators ) into a single communication system , and information can arrive simultaneously at different places of the network .",
    "this scenario may have technological applications , e.g. in digital communication @xcite , and it may also guide us towards a better understanding of information processing in real neural networks @xcite .",
    "it is easy to say whether the set @xmath46 is localized in a two dimensional plane ; this could be done for example by visual inspection . in multi - dimensional system",
    "it might not be obvious whether the set @xmath46 is localized .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that in a projection of a higher dimensional system onto a low dimensional space , the set @xmath46 might fulfill the projected attractor .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the localization might have to be realized in the full attractor of the subsystem .",
    "the analysis is also relatively easy if we bring about a property of the conditional observation . whenever there is ps , the conditional observation , given by @xmath236 , is not topologically transitive @xcite in the attractor of @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath46 is localized .",
    "the conditional observations @xmath236 are topologically transitive in the attractor @xmath237 of @xmath5 @xcite if for any two open sets @xmath238 ,    @xmath239    to check whether @xmath41 is localized , we do the following .",
    "if there is ps , for @xmath240 it exists infinitely many @xmath241 such that @xmath242 where @xmath243 is an open ball of radius @xmath244 centered at the point @xmath55 , and @xmath244 is small .",
    "we may vary @xmath245 and @xmath55 to analyze whether it is possible to fulfill eq .",
    "( [ practice_basic_sets ] ) .",
    "whenever this is possible , it means that the set @xmath246 does not spreads over the attractor of @xmath5 , and therefore , there is ps .    for analysis of ps basing on experimental data @xcite where the relevant dynamical variables can be measured , so that the phase space is recovered , our approach can be used straightforwardly . if one just has access to a bivariate time series , one first has to reconstruct the attractors , and then proceed the ps detection by our approach",
    "in this section , we analyze the relationship between the sets @xmath46 and the capacity of information transmission between chaotic oscillators . in order to proceed such an analysis",
    ", we may assume that the oscillators are identical or nearly identical .",
    "such that the synchronized trajectories are not far from the synchronization manifold , i.e. the subspace where @xmath247 @xcite .",
    "next , for a sake of simplicity we consider only oscillators whose trajectory possess a proper rotation and are coherent @xcite , e.g. the standard rssler oscillator .",
    "however , the ideas herein can be extended to other oscillators as well .    the amount of information that two systems @xmath5 and @xmath6 can exchange is given by the mutual information @xmath248 @xcite : @xmath249 where @xmath250 is the entropy of the oscillator @xmath5 and @xmath251 is the conditional entropy between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which measures the ambiguity of the received signal , roughly speaking the errors in the transmission .    as pointed out in ref . @xcite the mutual information can be also estimated through the conditional exponents associated to the synchronization manifold .",
    "the mutual information is given by : @xmath252 where @xmath253 are the positive conditional lyapunov exponents associated to the synchronization manifold , the information produced by the synchronous trajectories , and @xmath254 are the positive conditional lyapunov exponents transversal to the synchronization manifold , related with the errors in the information transmission . in ps @xmath254 can be small , which means that one can exchange information with a low probability of errors .",
    "so , ps creates a channel for reliable information exchanging @xcite . in general",
    ", we expect @xmath255 , where @xmath256 are the positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "thus @xmath257 .",
    "in order to estimate an upper bound for @xmath248 , we need to estimate @xmath254 , what can be done directly from the localized sets .",
    "the conditional transversal exponent can be estimated from the localized sets by a simple geometric analysis . at the time @xmath146 the oscillator @xmath5 reaches the poincar plane at @xmath258 while the oscillator @xmath6 is at @xmath259 .",
    "the initial distance between the trajectories is @xmath260 .",
    "this distance evolves until the time @xmath162 when the oscillator @xmath6 reaches the poincar plane at @xmath261 , while the trajectory of @xmath5 is at @xmath262 .",
    "the new distance is @xmath263 .",
    "therefore , we have :    @xmath264    so , the local transversal exponent is given by : @xmath265 where we use the convention @xmath266 .",
    "of course , we only estimate the conditional exponent close to the poincar plane . hence",
    ", if we change the poincar plane the conditional exponent may also change , i.e. there are some events that carry more information than others .",
    "we illustrate this approach for two coupled rssler oscillators .",
    "we set the parameters to @xmath267 , @xmath268 , @xmath269 , @xmath270 , and @xmath271 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath272 , the two oscillator undergo a transition to ps .",
    "in particular , for @xmath273 we have @xmath274 .",
    "we estimate @xmath275 at this situation by means of eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "we set the poincar section at @xmath276 , and compute @xmath277 for @xmath278 cycles , i.e. 65,000 crossing of the trajectory with @xmath279 and @xmath280 .",
    "we get @xmath281 .",
    "note that we are not computing @xmath275 , but rather , the maximum @xmath282 , namely @xmath283 .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect @xmath282 to be smaller than @xmath275 .",
    "however , the upper bound to the information exchange can be estimated by @xmath284 , that is , the maximum amount of information that can flow through the coupled oscillators if we encode the trajectory using the poincar plane @xmath279 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it seems that when the level of synchronization is large , the estimation of @xmath285 , by means of eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) , might become problematic , due to strong fluctuations in @xmath286 $ ] .",
    "we have proposed an extension of the stroboscopic map , as a general way to detect ps in coupled oscillators .",
    "the idea consists in constraining the observation of the trajectory of an oscillator at these times in which typical events occur in the other oscillator .",
    "this approach provides an efficient and easy way of detecting ps , without having to explicitly calculate the phase .",
    "we have shown that if ps is present , the maps of the attractor appear as a localized set in the phase - space .",
    "this has been illustrated in coherent oscillators , the coupled rsslers , as well as in non - coherent oscillators , spiking / bursting neurons of hr type coupled with chemical synapses . as we have shown in neural networks ,",
    "the appearance of clusters of ps is rather common , which may be relevant for communication mainly due to two aspects : @xmath234 the clusters provide multiplexing information processing , namely each cluster may be used to transmit information within a bandwidth . @xmath235",
    "they provide a multichannel communication , that is , a large number of neurons is integrated into a single communication system .",
    "moreover , we have analyzed the relation between the information exchanging and the localized sets .",
    "we have roughly estimated the errors in the information transmission from the localized sets .",

    "in this appendix we prove the theorem 1 .",
    "it is instructive to give a sketch of the proof , in order to have a better understanding of the result .",
    "we split the demonstration into the following four steps : @xmath234 we show that the increasing of @xmath190 in the phase @xmath287 defines a smooth section @xmath288 on @xmath289 , which does not intersect itself .",
    "@xmath235 we show that observing the oscillator @xmath5 whenever oscillators @xmath6 crosses @xmath290 gives place to a localized set @xmath41 . @xmath291",
    "further , we show that the observation of @xmath5 whenever @xmath6 crosses a piece @xmath292 of the section @xmath290 also gives place to a localized set",
    ". @xmath293 using these results we show that , actually , the localized sets can be constructed using any typical event . to show this , we only note that given a typical event with positive measure , we can choose @xmath292 to be close to the event occurrence , implying that shortly before or shortly after of every event occurrence , a crossing of the trajectory with @xmath292 will happen .",
    "thus , if we observe @xmath5 whenever the event occurs in @xmath6 we will have a set that a close the @xmath41 , and therefore , localized .",

    "thus , we construct a section @xmath296 .",
    "@xmath296 is smooth since both @xmath302 and @xmath303 are smooth .",
