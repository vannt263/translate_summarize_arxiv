    "the top quark reaches great interest since it breaks the @xmath3 symmetry maximally and it has rich decay products due to its large mass .",
    "the rare decays of the top quark have been studied in the literature , in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) and beyond @xcite-@xcite ; the one - loop flavor changing transitions @xmath4 in @xcite and @xmath0 in @xcite .    in the sm ,",
    "these decays are suppressed as a result of glashow - iliopoulos- miaiani ( gim ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "the branching ratios ( @xmath5 ) of the decays @xmath4 have been predicted in the sm as @xmath6 in @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 , which can give strong clues about the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking , has been calculated at the order of the magnitude of @xmath7 in the sm , in @xcite .",
    "these are small rates for the measurement , even at the highest luminosity accelerators and therefore , there is a need to analyse these rare decays in a new physics beyond the sm .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the flavor changing @xmath0 decay in the framework of the general two higgs doublet model ( model iii),where @xmath8 is the sm higgs boson . here , we take the yukawa couplings complex and switch on the cp violating effects . since the @xmath5 is at the order of @xmath9 in the sm , we neglect this contribution and calculate the new physics effects in the model iii . in the calculations ,",
    "we take into account the interactions due to the internal mediating charged higgs boson @xmath10 and neglect the ones including internal neutral higgs bosons , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( see discussion part ) .",
    "the numerical results show that the @xmath5 of this process can reach to the values of order @xmath13 , playing with the free parameters of the model iii , respecting the existing experimental restrictions .",
    "this prediction is almost seven orders larger compared to the one in the sm and it is a measurable quantity in the accelerators .",
    "furthermore , we predict the possible cp asymmetry @xmath14 at the order of @xmath15 for the intermediate values of the cp parameter , due to the complex yukawa coupling @xmath16 ( see section 2 for its definition ) .",
    "this is purely a new physics effect and the measurement of @xmath14 for the process under consideration may open a new window to go beyond the sm and test the new physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the @xmath5 and @xmath14 of the decay @xmath17 in the framework of model iii .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions .",
    "the flavor changing transition @xmath0 is quite suppressed in the sm due to the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "the extended higgs sector could bring large contributions to this decay and make cp violation possible , in general .",
    "this section is devoted to the calculation of the @xmath5 and the cp violating asymmetry of the decay under consideration , in the general two higgs doublet model , so called model iii . in the model iii , the flavor changing neutral currents in the tree level are permitted and various new parameters , such as yukawa couplings , masses of new higgs bosons , exist .",
    "the @xmath0 process is controlled by the yukawa interaction and in the model iii , it reads as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote chiral projections @xmath21 , @xmath22 for @xmath23 , are the two scalar doublets , @xmath24 are left handed quark doublets , @xmath25 are right handed up ( down ) quark singlets , with family indices @xmath26 . the yukawa matrices @xmath27 and @xmath28 have in general complex entries .",
    "it is possible to collect sm particles in the first doublet and new particles in the second one by choosing the parametrization for @xmath29 and @xmath30 as @xmath31\\ , ;   \\phi_{2}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{array}{c c }   \\sqrt{2 } h^{+}\\\\ h_1+i h_2 \\end{array}\\right ) \\,\\ , . \\label{choice}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the vacuum expectation values , @xmath32 here , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the mass eigenstates @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively since no mixing occurs between two cp - even neutral bosons @xmath8 and @xmath11 at tree level , for our choice .",
    "the flavor changing ( fc ) interaction can be obtained as @xmath35 where the couplings @xmath36 for the fc charged interactions are @xmath37 and @xmath38 is defined by the expression @xmath39 here the index `` n '' in @xmath38 denotes the word `` neutral '' .",
    "the sm contribution to the @xmath5 of the process @xmath0 is negligibly small , which is at the order of the magnitude @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , we take into account only the new effects beyond the sm .",
    "the relevant diagrams are given in fig [ fig1 ] . at this stage",
    ", we would like to discuss the possibilities not to take into account the tree level contribution to the decay underconsideration , in the model iii .",
    "first , it can be assumed that all the off diagonal neutral yukawa couplings vanish and therefore the coupling @xmath41 vanishes .",
    "another possibility is to take the mixing between two neutral higgs bosons @xmath8 and @xmath11 is small and the tree level interaction @xmath42 is negligible . in our case , we consider the gauge and @xmath43 invariant higgs potential which spontaneously breaks @xmath3 down to @xmath44 as : @xmath45 ^ 2 + c_4 [ ( \\phi_1^+ \\phi_1 ) ( \\phi_2^+ \\phi_2)-(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)(\\phi_2^+ \\phi_1 ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   c_5 [ re(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)]^2 + c_{6 } [ im(\\phi_1^+ \\phi_2)]^2   + c_{7}\\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since we assume that only @xmath46 has vacuum expectation value , no mixing occurs between two neutral higgs bosons and the tree level interaction vanishes .",
    "furthermore , since we take the c - quark mass zero and the coupling @xmath41 negligible compared to the couplings @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( see @xcite ) , the main contribution comes from the diagrams with internal charged higgs boson and for the matrix element , we get @xmath49 where @xmath50 and the functions @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 are defined as @xmath54 with @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 . using the eq . ( [ m1 ] ) ,",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the decay width as @xmath58 now we would like to give the expression for @xmath14 of the above process . here",
    ", we take @xmath16 and @xmath47 complex with the parametrizations @xmath59 and assume that the complexity of @xmath47 is small . using the definition of the cp violating asymmetry @xmath14 @xmath60",
    "we get @xmath61 where @xmath62 and the functions @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given in eq .",
    "( [ f1f2f3 ] ) .",
    "here the symbol @xmath63 denotes the complex conjugation .",
    "as it is shown from the eq .",
    "( [ acp ] ) , @xmath14 vanishes when two cp violating angles @xmath64 and @xmath65 are equal .",
    "this is interesting , since @xmath14 can vanish even in the existence of complex phases , in the model iii .",
    "in this section , we study the @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 dependencies of the @xmath5 and @xmath14 for the process @xmath0 , in the model iii . for the calculation of the @xmath5",
    "we take the value of the total decay width @xmath69 as @xmath70 .",
    "notice that the coupling @xmath68 is defined as @xmath71 .    the process @xmath0 exists also in the sm and model ii ( or i ) version of the 2hdm . in both models",
    "this process appears at least at loop level . in the sm model internal mediating @xmath72 bosons are responsible for this decay and",
    "its br is very small , at the order of the magnitude of @xmath40 . in the model ii ,",
    "additional contribution comes from the charged higgs boson @xmath10 and can be enhanced compared to the sm result by playing with the free parameter @xmath73 , respecting the experimental measurements .",
    "however , no @xmath14 occurs in the model ii ( i ) and also in the sm .",
    "this forces one to go into the model iii , with complex and possibly large yukawa couplings .",
    "model iii contains large number of free parameters such as yukawa couplings , @xmath74 , the masses of new higgs bosons , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and they should be restricted by using experimental measurements . at this stage",
    "we summarize these restrictions :    * we neglect all the yukawa couplings except @xmath75 and @xmath76 since they are negligible due to their light flavor contents , by our assumption . notice that we also neglect the off diogonal coupling @xmath77 , since it is smaller compared to @xmath78 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the new neutral higgs bosons do not have any contribution to the @xmath5 of the decay under consideration . *",
    "we take @xmath75 and @xmath76 complex and respect the constraint for the angle @xmath65 and @xmath79 , due to the experimental upper limit of neutron electric dipole moment , @xmath80 , which leads to @xmath81 for @xmath82 gev @xcite .",
    "* we find a constraint region for these free parameters by restricting the wilson coefficient @xmath83 , which is the effective coefficient of the operator @xmath84 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , in the region @xmath85 . here upper and lower limits were calculated using the cleo measurement @xcite @xmath86 and all possible uncertainities in the calculation of @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "for completeness we present the wilson coefficient @xmath83 . denoting the contribution for the sm with @xmath87 and the additional charged higgs contribution with @xmath88",
    ", we have the initial values @xmath89 the lo corrected coefficient @xmath90 is given as @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the numbers which appear during the evaluation @xcite .",
    "the explicit forms of the functions @xmath95 are , @xmath96 the discussion given above allows us to obtain a constraint region for the couplings @xmath75 , @xmath76 and the cp violating parameters , @xmath97 and @xmath66 . here",
    ", we assume that the coupling @xmath75 has a small imaginary part and we choose @xmath98 .",
    "notice that , in figures , the @xmath5 is restricted in the region between solid ( dashed ) lines for @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) . here , there are two possible solutions for @xmath83 due to the cases where @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in the case of complex yukawa couplings , only the solutions obeying @xmath101 exist .    in fig .",

    "its magnitude is almost @xmath108 larger for @xmath99 compared to the one for @xmath100 .    fig .",
    "[ brksibb ] represents the @xmath5 with respect to @xmath109 for @xmath103 , @xmath110 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",

    "this observation is an important clue about the upper limit of the coupling @xmath109 , with the possible future measurement of the @xmath5 .",
    "for the small coupling @xmath109 , the restricted region for the @xmath5 becomes narrow , for both @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "@xmath14 is at the order of the magnitude of @xmath15 for the intermeditate values of @xmath66 and it can reach to @xmath113 for @xmath99 .",
    "notice that @xmath97 is taken small and @xmath14 vanishes when two cp parameters have the same values , namely @xmath114 .",
    "if @xmath14 is positive ( negative ) , @xmath115 can have both signs .",
    "however , if it is negative , @xmath115 must be negative .",
    "this observation is useful in the determination of the sign of @xmath115 .",

    "this ensures a crucial test for the new physics beyond the sm . *",
    "the @xmath5 is sensitive to @xmath109 and its measurement makes it possible to predict an upper limit for this coupling .",
