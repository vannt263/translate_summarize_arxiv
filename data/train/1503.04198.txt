    "during five nights in june / july 2008 , 123 of the brightest gcs around ngc5128  were observed using the fibre large array multi - element spectrograph ( flames ) instrument at the very large telescope ( vlt ) on cerro paranal , chile .",

    "in a similar analysis of dispersion supported csss , including a subsample of the gcs considered here , @xcite found a value of @xmath223 to fit their data , connecting `` classical '' gcs to more massive systems like ucds and dwarf elliptical galaxies .",
    "this relation is shown in figure  [ fig : mass_mld_size ] by the thin dashed black line and is too shallow to fit either of the @xmath7-@xmath6 sequences of the present gc sample .  to better represent the data",
    ", we instead make an effort to fit power - laws to the sequences individually and find that each is well approximated by distinct , tight relations as described in the following .",

    "interestingly , we find two lmc gcs ( ngc2257 and ngc1754 , see figure  [ fig : mass_mld_size ] ) that appear to align well with the dsc  sequence .  while no strong statements can be made about only two objects , their exclusive presence around a currently interacting satellite of the mw marks an interesting starting point to investigate any connection to the dsc  sequence .",
    "@xmath7 is plotted as a function of @xmath196 in figure  [ fig : mag_mld_size ] , which shows that the dgto  sequence is composed exclusively of the brightest gcs of the sample .",

    "the fact that we do not observe current tidal features indicative of stripping might be due to the surface brightness limits of available data , but higher ( i.e.  non - equilibrium ) losvds might still be consistent with theoretical predictions .",
    "for instance , @xcite model a dwarf galaxy similar to the ufd umaii , which with @xmath273 ( implying @xmath274 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is an obvious likely candidate for a dsc  sequence object progenitor . by subjecting it to tidal forces in a milky way - like gravitational potential , these authors successfully reproduced many observed properties ( e.g.  luminosity , central surface brightness , ellipticity , etc . ) of umaii , and found that the galaxy s @xmath17 can be boosted on timescales of a few gyr , in particular around the apocentre of the orbit .",
    "their modeling showed that `` @xmath17 boosting '' can easily reproduce umaii s @xmath17 , and can even reach extreme levels of @xmath275 km s@xmath11 when the orbital trajectory is close to being perpendicular to the disk of the host galaxy .",
    "the models therefore suggest that the extreme @xmath7 for the dsc  objects could potentially be explained without requiring large amounts of dm .  while this result , assuming that `` @xmath17 boosting '' scales to a ge galaxy like ngc5128 , might be sufficient to explain a handful of the dsc  clusters , we consider it highly unlikely that all such clusters can be accounted for , due to the required synchronization of their apocentre passages and current line - of - sight alignments .",

    "assuming that `` @xmath17 boosting '' is unable to solely account for the dsc  objects , then the small sizes compared to ufd - like galaxies call for careful skepticism if dm is the preferred explanation .",
    "for example , characteristic central dm densities for dwarf galaxies , if canonical halo profiles are assumed , can range from @xmath276 pc@xmath277 for preferred cored profiles , to as much as @xmath278 pc@xmath277 for cuspy profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "irrespective of this problem , such high dm densities might actually give rise to central baryonic concentrations that enable the formation of imbhs .",
    "this might be realized by triggering an extremely dense central stellar environment , leading to a runaway collisional event that culminates with the formation of a central bh that might continue to grow through the accretion of binary star and higher - order multiplets .    given all of these interpretations",
    ", it seems just as likely that a combination of central imbhs and/or dark stellar remnants , cuspier - than - expected dm halos , and/or `` @xmath17 boosting '' could be at work",
    ".  this conclusion may in fact be the most reasonable one , given that imbhs would presumably be of dwarf galaxy origin given the difficulty in building up such a mass in a gc - like structure without just as remarkable early star - formation efficiency",
    ".  then , the residual dm leftover after stripping , if cuspy , in combination with `` @xmath17 boosting '' , may be sufficient to produce these new objects .",
    "this final interpretation would then require both less extreme bh and dm masses , while avoiding the orbital synchronization problem .",

    "new high - resolution spectra of compact stellar objects around the giant elliptical galaxy ngc5128  ( centaurus a ) were analyzed .",

    "based on these estimates we derived dynamical mass and mass - to - light ratio estimates by combining the new kinematical information with structural parameters ( mostly obtained from hst imaging ) and photometric measurements from the literature .",

    "plausible alternative and/or concurrent explanations also include particularly top- or bottom - heavy imfs , or the dynamical influence of central imbhs . altogether we consider that these objects represent the very bright tail of the gclf which is well represented around ngc5128 , but poorly populated in the local group .",
    "while the dgto  sequence has a fairly pedestrian explanation , the @xmath293 values of the dsc  sequence objects are much more difficult to reconcile with the dgto  branch scenarios , save for a small subset .",
    "we investigated in detail ( see appendix , for details ) the potential impact of observational , low s / n , and/or instrumental effects on artificially inflating the dsc  values , and found that astrophysical explanations are required .    for most of these objects the average stellar velocities",
    "( _ vis -  - vis _ the observed @xmath5 values ) do not appear to be high enough for extreme rotation to explain their dynamics , and if they were , then the clusters would be unstable against rotational break - up .",
    "moreover , it is highly unlikely that all clusters would have their rotation axes aligned with the plane of the sky ( assuming @xmath294 $ ] ) , as would be needed to reproduce and minimize the scatter in the observed @xmath7 vs.  @xmath195 relation .",
    "combined with the difficulty in explaining a mechanism that would impart and maintain the necessary angular momentum for such large rotational velocities , we thus consider extreme rotation / significantly out - of - equilibrium dynamical configurations insufficient and unlikely to explain their properties .",
    "we considered the plausibility of central imbhs and a central accumulation of dark stellar remnants , consisting of stellar - mass bhs and neutron stars , to be driving the extreme dynamics of the dsc  clusters .",
    "if they exist , then putative central imbhs and remnant population can plausibly influence enough of the stars in many of the dsc  clusters to provide an explanation for their velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "in fact , if our assumed canonical structural profiles were sufficiently perturbed by an imbh s presence and/or stellar remnant population , then this explanation requires even less massive imbhs to become plausible .  with that said ,",
    "given that the imbh + stellar remnant interpretation can only account for the dynamics of @xmath295 of these objects , this is unlikely to explain the emergence of the dsc  sequence .",
    "if central imbhs and stellar remnant populations are not the only cause of the elevated @xmath7 , then the possibility of significant dark matter mass components must be considered , despite the wide acceptance that `` classical '' gcs are devoid of dm .",
    "this result would have important implications for gc formation models and early structure formation , and indicate that not all extragalactic star clusters are genuine gcs .",
    "more importantly , the presence of such amounts of dm in the dsc  sequence objects would imply that they represent the lowest mass primordial dark matter halos that have survived accretion onto larger - scale structures to the present day .",
    "in other words , there may still exist a large reservoir of @xmath265-scale dark matter halos surviving in relative isolation in the universe today , at least around relatively quiescent larger dark matter halos like ngc5128 .",
    "moreover , if these objects are stripped of formerly more massive dark matter halos , presumably as former dwarf galaxies , this would imply the presence of a significant collection of objects with @xmath296 , and @xmath297 in the relatively recent past of ngc5128 .",
    "this interpretation is not without its serious problems .",
    "for example , with the above properties , central ( @xmath298pc ) dm masses / densities on the order of @xmath299 larger than canonical dm halo profiles would be required ; a scenario that can not be reconciled with any current theoretical framework .",
    "given the improbability that such massive central bhs , exotic and ultra - concentrated dm halos , or extremely out - of - equilibrium dynamical configurations can individually explain the properties of the dsc  sequence objects , it seems perhaps most likely that a mixed bag of such factors may be at play behind this result , although it is puzzling how a combination of these physical mechanisms would conspire to generate a relatively sharp @xmath7 vs.  @xmath195 relation .",
    "it remains to be seen if similar objects exist in the star cluster systems of other galaxies , but verification of these results will be difficult for more distant systems due to their intrinsic low luminosities .",
    "nonetheless , detailed chemical abundance studies of these objects will shed light on the origins ( e.g.  primordial or not , simple or multi - generational stellar populations , etc . )  of both dgto  and dsc  clusters .",
    "while the proximity of ngc5128  provides the possibility to study the internal dynamics and stellar populations of its csss , the distance approaches the limits of what is currently feasible with today s instrumentation on 8 - 10 m class telescopes .",

    "we note that we are using the raw @xmath3 measurement directly obtained from the spectra without subsequent correction for gc light profile sampling .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig : sigma_radial ] @xmath3 as functions of galactocentric radius ( @xmath197 ; left panel ) , and azimuthal angle ( @xmath318 ; right panel ) , where 0@xmath317 corresponds to north and @xmath318 increases clockwise .",
    "we find no indications for any @xmath3-@xmath197 or @xmath3-@xmath318 correlations for our gc sample .",
    "more importantly , we find no such correlations for either of the gc sub - samples , in particular for the dsc  gcs ( red squares ) .",
    "we conclude that systematic variations in @xmath3 as a function of spatial distribution are not responsible for the bifurcation in the @xmath7-@xmath6 relation .",
    "here we investigate the fractional flux from ngc5128 s diffuse galaxy light component that enters each fibre together with the gc light .",
    "we consider the potential impact of such fibre contamination , which could potentially lead the _ ppxf _ code to predict artificially high @xmath3 values .",
    "however , if this was the case , one would expect that the associated error bars would reflect this uncertainty ( given full error propagation ) , and/or that the elevated @xmath7 values required to explain the dsc  sequence ( see  [ sec : origins ] ) would either tend towards _ higher _ values with _ decreasing _ luminosity , which is not seen in our data ( see figure  [ fig : mag_mld_size ] and [ fig : xmass_frac ] ) , or that there would be a vanishing or no @xmath7-@xmath6 correlation at all .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : mass_mld_size ] , the dsc  sequence is consistent with the individual error bars , which themselves are dominated by the fully propagated uncertainties on @xmath17 .    given that our background light sed modeling and subsequent subtraction from each fibre is not a localized process ( see   [ sec : skysub ] ) , visual inspection of the sky+background subtracted gc spectra indicated that they should not be significantly affected by residual galaxy light contamination . to be sure , we explicitly calculated the expected residuals by comparing the difference between the flux of ngc5128  at the location of each target and our final sky estimates to the flux of our final target spectra .",
    "the results suggested that residual components due to diffuse galaxy light is for all gcs @xmath319% , and in most cases near the 1% level , with the expected trend toward lower residuals with increasing @xmath197 .",
    "we then tested for the maximal effects of these residuals on the dsc  sequence objects by adding the signal from the nearest sky fibre to the final , reduced target spectra at flux levels between 1% and 90% of the object flux and re - measuring @xmath3 .",
    "the results showed that below @xmath320 , the effect on @xmath3 was negligible , above which @xmath3 monotonically growing with increased sky contamination , as one would expect .    in any case ,",
    "we plot in the left panel of figure  [ fig : contamination ] the @xmath7-@xmath6 plane , as in figure  [ fig : mass_mld_size ] , but parametrize the data point color this time with the local surface brightness of ngc5128  at each gc location .",
    "we obtain the surface brightness values from the profiles measured as part of the carnegie - irvine galaxy survey ( cgs ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "no obvious correlations with local surface brightness values are found that would drive the bifurcation in the @xmath7-@xmath6 relation .",
    "we continue by using the surface brightness profile for ngc5128  to compute the fractional background flux , @xmath321 , entering each fibre with the gc fluxes .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : contamination ] shows the results , with color parameterized by @xmath322 _ before _ any sky+background subtraction is performed .",
    "several results are shown : 1 ) the  classical \" and dgto  sequence gcs reveal the expected correlation between gc mass ( i.e.  luminosity ) and @xmath321 with a decreasing @xmath321 sequence from @xmath323 for the low - mass gcs to negligible fractions for the highest - mass clusters ; 2 ) gcs on the dsc  sequence show on average larger @xmath321 than gcs on the dgto  sequence as expected from the trends seen in figure  [ fig : mag_mld_size ] , which shows that dsc  gcs have luminosities of @xmath324 mag ; 3 ) the dsc  sequence gcs show _ no _ correlation between @xmath321 and @xmath7 or @xmath6 , in contrast to the expectation if the @xmath7-@xmath6 sequences were created by insufficient background light subtraction .    while figure  [ fig : contamination ] illustrates fibre contamination before any sky modeling and subtraction",
    "was carried out , we performed one final test to check for the worst effect that insufficient background subtraction could have .",
    "we first identified higher - s / n gcs with @xmath3 equivalent to that which would give a `` normal '' @xmath7 for a dsc  sequence cluster .",
    "for example , given the dsc  gc0324 s @xmath325 and @xmath326 , we identified the dgto  gc0050 with @xmath327 , which would give @xmath328 .  using three such combinations , we scaled the individual spectra of the bright gc , pre - sky subtraction , to the flux level of the fainter cluster , and added the nearest sky fibre s signal . performing the sky subtraction as before ( see   [ sec : skysub ] ) with the next three closest fibres then simulated the noise levels of the faint gc , but preserved the spectral details of the brighter .",
    "measuring @xmath3 on the degraded spectrum was , at worst , consistent with our adopted measurements , and even led to a slightly lower @xmath3 for two of the experiments .",
    "we conclude that improper background subtraction is thus very unlikely to inflate our @xmath3 measurements of the dsc  sequence objects .",

    "<S> we present a study of the dynamical properties of 125 compact stellar systems ( csss ) in the nearby giant elliptical galaxy ngc5128 , using high - resolution spectra ( @xmath0 ) obtained with vlt / flames . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide evidence for a new type of star cluster , based on the css dynamical mass scaling relations .  </S>",
    "<S> all radial velocity ( @xmath1 ) and line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( @xmath2 ) measurements are performed with the penalized pixel fitting ( _ ppxf _ ) technique , which provided @xmath3 estimates for 115 targets .  </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 estimates are corrected to the 2d projected half - light radii , @xmath4 , as well as the cluster cores , @xmath5 , accounting for observational / aperture effects and are combined with structural parameters , from high spatial resolution imaging , in order to derive total dynamical masses ( @xmath6 ) for 112 members of ngc5128 s star cluster system .  in total , 89 csss have dynamical masses measured for the first time along with the corresponding dynamical mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath7 ) .  </S>",
    "<S> we find two distinct sequences in the @xmath7-@xmath6 plane , which are well approximated by power laws of the forms @xmath8 and @xmath9 .  </S>",
    "<S> the shallower sequence corresponds to the very bright tail of the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) , while the steeper relation appears to be populated by a distinct group of objects which require significant dark gravitating components such as central massive black holes and/or exotically concentrated dark matter distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this result would suggest that the formation and evolution of these csss are markedly different from the  classical \" globular clusters in ngc5128  and the local group , despite the fact that these clusters have luminosities similar to the gclf turn - over magnitude .  </S>",
    "<S> we include a thorough discussion of myriad factors potentially influencing our measurements . </S>"
