    "if borrowers have only assets that when liquidated generate cash in a local currency different from the currency in which their debt is due , their default risk will be higher than in the one currency case , as a consequence of the additional exchange rate risk .",
    "the increase in default risk is reflected both in higher probabilities of default ( pds ) as well as in higher asset correlations between the borrowers .    in this note , by modifying merton s model of the default of a firm , we derive some simple relations between the pds without and with exchange rate risk , between the borrowers asset correlations without and with exchange rate risk , and pds and asset correlations when taking account of exchange rate risk .    in general , the formulae we derive include as parameters the borrowers asset volatilities , the exchange rate volatility , and the mean logarithmic ratio of the exchange rates at times 1 and 0 .",
    "however , assuming independence of the exchange rate and the borrowers asset values as well as zero mean logarithmic ratio of exchange rates at times 1 and 0 yields a relation between the borrowers asset correlation without and with exchange rate risk and the borrowers pds without and with exchange rate risk that does not require knowledge of additional parameters ( see equation ) .",
    "in the special case of borrowers with identical individual risk characteristics (= pds ) , relation can be stated as follows : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the original pd and asset correlation without exchange rate risk and @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the pd and asset correlation when there is additional exchange rate risk .",
    "both and can be understood as consistency conditions that should be satisfied when the risk parameters pd and asset correlation are to be adjusted for incorporating exchange rate risk .",
    "we describe in section [ sec : just ] the background of the model we use . in section [",
    "se : metho ] , it is shown how the results are derived from the model .",
    "the note concludes with a brief discussion of what has been reached .",
    "as in merton s model for the default of a firm @xcite , we assume that @xmath5 , the borrower s asset value as a function of time , can be described by a geometric brownian motion , i.e. @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the asset value at time @xmath8 ( today ) , @xmath9 is the drift of the asset value process , @xmath10 is its volatility , and @xmath11 denotes a standard brownian motion that explains the randomness of the future asset values .    similar to , we assume that @xmath12 , the exchange rate of the two currencies at time @xmath13 , can be described as another geometric brownian motion @xcite , i.e. @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the exchange rate at time @xmath8 , @xmath16 is the drift of the exchange rate process , @xmath17 is its volatility , and @xmath18 denotes another standard brownian motion that explains the randomness of the future exchange rates .",

    "hence the asset value must be multiplied with the exchange rate at time 1 :    @xmath24    from an economic point of view , it is convenient to divide both sides of by @xmath15 .",
    "this leads to @xmath25 with @xmath26    the advantage of compared to is the fact that on the one hand the debt level is expressed as a value in the local currency of the borrower s assets with an exchange rate as observed today . on the other hand ,",
    "compared to the one currency case the volatility of the left - hand side of is higher because it includes the factor @xmath27 that reflects the change of the exchange rate between today and time 1 .",
    "this effect might be mitigated to some extent by the difference of the interest rates in the two countries .",
    "for the purpose of this note , however , it is assumed that mitigation by interest rates differences can be neglected .",
    "this assumption seems justified in particular when the debt is composed of fixed rate loans or is short - term .    taking the logarithm of both sides of and standardisation of the random variable @xmath28 lead to @xmath29",
    "define now @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 to arrive at    @xmath33    in , @xmath34 is the logarithmic ratio of the exchange rates at times 1 and 0 and is jointly normally distributed with @xmath35 . as a consequence from ,",

    "combining the reasoning that led to and with the reasoning for then yields a description of the joint default behaviour under exchange rate uncertainty as follows : the default events for borrowers 1 and 2 are characterised by the equation    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are as in . should be the same as in might be surprising at first glance .",
    "it follows , however , from the fact that in the foreign currency debt amount has been converted to a local currency amount at today s exchange rate .",
    "additional uncertainty and higher default risk are then caused by the fact that the exchange rate in one year may differ from today s rate .",
