    "starburst galaxies were anticipated as @xmath0ray sources  @xcite , provided sufficient instrumental sensitivity , due to their enhance star formation and supernova ( sn ) explosion rate , in dense ( gas and dust enriched ) environments .",
    "sn remnants and shock winds from massive stars are supposed to accelerate cosmic rays ( cr ) . due to their collisions with ambient nuclei and subsequent @xmath1 decay ,",
    "very energetic @xmath0rays are produced , and those can in turn be detected both with space - born and ground - based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes .",
    "recently , the detection of m82 was presented by the veritas collaboration at the icrc 2009 , while the integral flux of the fainter ngc 253 has just been published by the h.e.s.s . collaboration . during the 2009 fermi symposium ,",
    "the data collected by the fermi space telescope was released and found coming in the direction of both galaxies .",
    "slight and reasonable variations in the parameter space of already published models  @xcite can fully account for the he and vhe emission coming from both galaxies , while agreeing with previous data detected from radio to infrared ( ir ) .",
    "we explore these changes and some implications they have for the cr distribution in these galaxies .",
    "the aim of this and previous studies is to perform a multi - wavelength model for the emission coming from the central part of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 . to model the highest energy emission we use the @xmath2 code , already presented in  @xcite and improved in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the computation consists on solving the diffusion - loss equation for a steady state population of both electrons and protons , taking into account losses in each particle population , and also secondary production .",
    "one of the major achievements of this study is presenting an accurate fit to multi - wavelength data . in fig .",
    "[ radioir ] , a multi - frequency spectrum is overplotted to previous radio and ir data . note that the prediction from the model is the summed contribution of synchrotron , free - free and dust emission , and not an actual fit to radio or ir data .",
    "the near , almost edge - on starburst galaxy m82 has a low - mass gas content , mostly concentrated in the inner 2 kpc , and presents a high luminosity both in the far ir and x - ray domain . as part of the m81 group",
    ", m82 shows hints of an encounter with some of its members 1gyr ago . as a result of tidal forces , it harbors a central ( 300 pc ) starburst .",
    "vhe @xmath0ray emission coming from m82 was claimed by veritas  @xcite during this summer , while the he regime was covered by fermi space telescope from the same galaxy . in fig .",
    "[ sedm82 ] , this data is shown together with the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the already published model  @xcite for a range of parameters and some specific outputs to better predict observed results ( see table  [ parametm82 ] ) .",
    "a separate contribution is plotted coming from each @xmath0ray generator : neutral pion ( @xmath1 ) decay , bremsstrahlung and inverse compton radiation .",
    "the latter was computed having the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , far and near ir photon densities as targets altogether ( see fig .",
    "[ radioir ] ) .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath1 decay contribution dominates at vhe energies .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ parametngc ]",
    "our multi - wavelength model explains reasonable well both the he and vhe emission coming from the two closest starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 , within a range of explored parameters .",
    "every component of the emission can be tracked to one and the same original cr population , and , in turn , result as a consequence of all electromagnetic and hadronic channels from the primary and subsequently - produced secondary particles .",
    "cr enhancement present in these starburst galaxies is reflected in the high energy density values that can be obtained from the steady proton population . above a proton energy of @xmath3 gev ( corresponding to e@xmath4 @xmath5 gev )",
    ", the energy density is around 10 ev @xmath6 for m82 and similar value for ngc 253 .",
    "now that the vhe regime has been finally achieved by ground - based telescopes , and fermi has proven that detections are possible from lower energies (   100 mev ) , a full picture of @xmath0ray emission is begining to appear more and more clearly .",
