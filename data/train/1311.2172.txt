    "atomic coherence lies in the center of many novel effects in quantum optics and laser physics .",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency [ 1,2 ] , coherent population trapping [ 2 ] , hanel - effect laser [ 3 ] and quantum beat laser [ 4 ] are such examples . besides these , the correlation between the photons can also be induced by atomic coherence [ 5 - 12 ] .",
    "one such example is the generation of squeezed light in a three - level cascade laser using atomic coherence [ 5 - 8 ] .",
    "the atomic coherence can be created by preparing the atoms initially in a coherent superposition state of the two states which are dipole - forbidden [ 5 - 8 ] or driving the two states by a strong coherent field [ 9 - 11 ] or raman coupling the two states through the third auxiliary atomic states [ 12 ] . for two - photon correlated - spontaneous - emission laser with injected atomic coherence , it exhibits complete spontaneous - emission noise quenching and phase squeezing simultaneously [ 5 ] .",
    "it has also been pointed out that atomic coherence in a two - photon correlated emission laser system can be used to generate a macroscopic two - mode entangled state and this system can be treated as an entanglement amplifier [ 12 ] .    recently , the topic of continuous - variable entanglement has attracted much attention as it is the base of all branches of quantum information and communication protocols [ 13 ] . among various entanglement generation schemes ,",
    "entanglement induced by atomic coherence has been extensively researched [ 14 - 16 ] . for a nondegenerate three - level cascade laser with a subthreshold nondegenerate",
    "parametric oscillator coupled to a vacuum reservoir , the entanglement and squeezing for the two cavity modes in this combined system is induced by the injected atomic coherence [ 14 ] . in a two - mode single - atom laser with the atomic coherence exhibited by two classical laser fields , entanglement between two field modes",
    "is demonstrated [ 15 ] .",
    "later , it was shown that in a three - level @xmath0 or v atomic system with two classical driving fields and two cavity modes coupling corresponding transitions , by exploring the two - channel interaction mechanism and using the squeeze - transformed modes , continuous - variable entanglement between the two modes is obtained and the best achievable entangled state approaches the original epr state [ 16 ] .",
    "the above work has mainly been confined to two - partite systems .    with the progress in continuous - variable entanglement ,",
    "the generation of more than two partite entanglement has been paid much attention as it may be the key ingredient for advanced multiparty quantum communication such as quantum teleportation network [ 17 ] , telecloning [ 18 ] and controlled dense coding [ 19 ] . among various generation schemes for tripartite systems ,",
    "few work has been done to generate tripartite entanglement using atomic coherence .",
    "most recently , a scheme to generate three - mode - entangled light fields via the interaction between the four - level atoms and the cavity has been proposed [ 20 ] .",
    "three cavity modes are generated through three successive transitions in the four - level cascade atoms .",
    "in addition to the cavity modes , two strong classical fields drive a pair of two - photon transitions in the four - level atoms .",
    "they show that the entanglement could only be obtained in a short time as all the mean photons are amplified as time elapses .",
    "thus at steady time , the entanglement does not exist .    in this paper",
    ", we present a scheme to generate tripartite entanglement for three cavity modes via the interaction for the three - level lambda atoms with the three cavity modes and two classical fields .",
    "as the classical fields are strong , the effective interaction is resonant interaction in the dressed - state picture .",
    "we deduce the master equation of the three cavity modes by means of the atomic dressed states and linear theory . the sufficient inseparability criterion for continuous - variable entanglement",
    "is used to demonstrate the entanglement properties of the three cavity modes and the results show that our system can be used as a source to generate tripartite entangled light even at steady state .",
    "it is should be noted that , up to now many schemes have been proposed to generate tripartite entanglement using linear optics or nonlinearities [ 17 , 21 - 26 ] .",
    "it was theoretically predicted that using single - mode squeezed state and linear optics , a truly n - partite entangled state can be generated [ 17 ] .",
    "later , a continuous - variable tripartite entangled state was experimental realized by combing three independent squeezed vacuum states [ 21 ] . at first , the production of continuous - variable tripartite entanglement was presented by mixing squeezed beams on unbalanced beamsplitters [ 21,22 ] .",
    "recently , generation of tripartite entanglement are focused on using cascade nonlinear interaction in an optical cavity [ 23 - 25 ] or in a quasiperiodic superlattice [ 26 ] . among the latter are systems using parametric down - conversion with sum frequency generation [ 23,25,26 ] or using single nonlinearity [ 24 ] . during these nonlinear processes , the cavity modes couple with each other directly .",
    "as these nonlinear processes are related to the higher - order polarization , the efficiency of these processes are relatively small compared with the processes related to linear polarization . in this way , these nonlinear processes are not the best choice for the generation of high efficiency tripartite entangled states .    compared with the schemes based on the nonlinear processes [ 23 - 26 ] , our scheme is more effective as the generation process is resonant interaction in the dressed states and it is only related to linear polarization .",
    "what s more , the linear process provides much more parameters to choose than that of the nonlinear processes , as the atomic parameters can be varied .",
    "compared with the scheme in ref .",
    "[ 20 ] , our scheme can provide steady state tripartite entanglement while the entanglement produced in scheme [ 20 ] is just kept in a quite limited time . and in ref .",
    "[ 20 ] , they use four - level cascade atomic system and the effective processes in the dressed states of the driving fields are all two - photon transitions .",
    "high excited states are involved in their scheme . in our scheme",
    "we use three - level @xmath0 atomic system , and the effective processes in the dressed states of the driving fields are all single - photon transitions .",
    "when we take into the account of the atomic spontaneous emission , their schemes seems to have more obstacles than ours .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the essential ingredients of the model and deduce the density - matrix equation for the cavity fields in a dressed - state picture . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the output correlation spectra by solving the equations of the cavity fields and analyze the output tripartite continuous - variable entanglement characteristics by using a sufficient criterion proposed by van loock and furusawa . in sec .",
    "iv , we give a brief conclusion .",

    "two laser fields of frequencies @xmath2 drive the transitions @xmath3 @xmath4 , respectively .",

    "we assume that the laser fields are much stronger than the cavity fields , i.e. , @xmath34 , ( @xmath35 . the laser fields can be viewed as dressing fields for the atoms .",
    "therefore , by diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath19 , we find the so - called semiclassical dressed states as @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
