    "black holes should be entirely described by their mass and spin , but their observational appearance is also determined by their mass accretion rate .",
    "current models of the accretion flow , both thin disc and hot flow solutions , show that the underlying physics should be fairly scale invariant i.e. the properties of the flow should simply scale mostly with mass for a given mass accretion rate in eddington units , @xmath2 .",
    "thus data from the well studied , stellar mass black hole binary ( bhb ) sources can be simply scaled up to describe the supermassive black holes in the center of agn .",
    "there is considerable evidence to support this conjecture .",
    "the different spectral states seen as a function of mass accretion rate in bhb may well be seen in agn ( pounds , done & osbourne 1995 ; vasudevan & fabian 2007 ; middleton , done & gierliski 2007 ) , and ` fundamental - plane ' type relations between radio and x - ray luminosity hold across the mass - scale ( merloni , heinz & di matteo 2003 ; falcke , krding & markoff 2004 ; kerding et al .",
    "the x - ray timing properties also support a simple scaling argument , with both bhbs and agn having a similar shape in their broad - band power density spectrum ( pds ) , but shifted in frequency due to the expected mass - scaling of the characteristic variability time - scales ( m@xmath3hardy et al .",
    "2004 ; done & gierliski 2005 ; m@xmath3hardy et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "l    however , bhbs also often show prominent low frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( lfqpos ) in their x - ray lightcurves ( e.g. remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "these have frequencies from 0.1 - 10  hz , so for typical agn masses these are not detectable given the lightcurves currently available ( vaughan & uttley 2005 ) .",
    "thus the single significant agn qpo , seen in the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy re  j1034 + 396 ( gierliski et al . 2008 ; confirmed using even more robust techniques by vaughan 2010 ) is most likely associated instead with the higher frequency qpos seen in bhbs .",
    "these are associated only with very specific spectral states ( very high / intermediate ) , so are much less frequently observed ( e.g. remillard et al .",
    "2002 ; remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "while there is currently no reliable mass estimate for this agn ( though recent work is converging on @xmath01 - 4@xmath410@xmath5m@xmath6 : e.g. bian & huang 2010 ; jin et al . in press ) , the best match in terms of mass scaled frequency ( and l / l@xmath7 ) appears to be the 67  hz qpo seen in the probably super - eddington bhb grs 1915 + 105 ( e.g. middleton & done 2010 ; morgan , remillard & greiner 1997 ; ueda , yamaoka , & remillard 2009 ; cui 1999 ; belloni et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the much longer timescale of the agn qpo presents an opportunity to examine this feature on the level of individual cycles .",
    "this contrasts with the high frequency bhb qpos which can currently only be studied in a statistical sense by averaging the behaviour over very many cycles , due to the small number of photons detected per cycle .",
    "thus the agn qpo may give more stringent tests of the origin of this oscillation than the corresponding bhb data .",
    "both the spectrum and variability of these data can be well modelled using two components , namely an extremely large soft x - ray excess ( sx ) which remains relatively constant on the timescale of the qpo , together with a weak power law tail to higher energies which is strongly modulated on the qpo timescale ( middleton et al .",
    "models of the complete spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of this object show that the sx is the dominant component of the total bolometric luminosity of @xmath05@xmath410@xmath8erg s@xmath9 ( puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1998 ; wang & netzer 2003 ; casebeer et al .",
    "2006 ; middleton et al . 2007 ;",
    "jin et al . in press ) , giving l / l@xmath7 @xmath0 4 - 1 for the black hole mass range of 1 - 4@xmath4 10@xmath10m@xmath6 discussed above .",
    "thus the equivalent sources in terms of high eddington fraction are grs 1915 + 105 ( see above ) , which has been accreting at or above eddington for more than 20 years ( e.g. truss & done 2006 ) and probably also the ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ; see fabbiano 1989 ; miller & colbert 2004 ; roberts 2007 )",
    ". both of these can show an sed dominated by a similarly distorted ` hot disc ' component to that which forms the sx in re j1034 + 105 ( zdziarski et al . 2003 ; middleton et al .",
    "2009 ; gladstone , roberts & done 2009 ) .",
    "l    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     thus the qpo is transient , and there is no clear trigger for its emergence .",
    "one potential way forward is instead to assume that this is similar to the 67hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 ( e.g. morgan , remillard & greiner 1997 ) and use the substantially larger dataset on grs 1915 + 105 to search for the trigger of the qpo in the stellar mass black hole .",
    "this has not yet been done , but may prove to be illuminating .",
    "re j1034 + 396 is one of the most extreme and important agn detected thus far as its timing properties resemble those of the highest luminosity bhbs .",
    "follow - up observations show that the pds no longer contains the strong qpo that characterised the lightcurve in the 2008 detection .",
    "such a change in the intrinsic variability properties indicates that the pds is non - stationary .",
    "we use covariance spectra to get better signal to noise on the spectrum of the variability .",
    "this reveals new features in the qpo itself .",
    "there is a soft component in addition to the power law tail which contributes to the qpo signal .",
    "folding the lightcurve on the qpo timescale over different energy bands indicates that this component lags behind the hard emission .",
    "this implies a size scale of @xmath11 if this is produced by reprocessing of the hard qpo spectrum , though we caution that the lag could also be caused by a more complex interaction between the disc and corona , rather than by reprocessing .",
    "however , a reprocessing origin puts some constraints on the qpo mechanism , since this requires a changing illumination of the disc .",
    "this probably rules out models where the qpo is from a radial perturbation precessing around the black hole , as here there is no change in disc illumination . instead",
    "this could be produced by a vertical or coupled vertical - radial ( breathing mode ) mode ( abramowicz & kluzniak 2005 ; blaes et al 2007 ) , or the oscillating shock model of das & czerny ( 2010 ) .",
    "we rule out occultation models from an orbiting cloud from the rgs data , which show that the ionised absorbed has narrow features at low velocity , unlike those expected from material within @xmath12 as required by the qpo timescale .",
    "none of the other 4 datasets show the qpo despite 3 of these showing rather similar spectra and 2 of these showing a rather similar covariance spectrum on short timescales .",
    "thus there is no clear trigger we can identify for the qpo from these data .",
    "we suggest instead that it may be useful to search the much more extensive datasets in black hole binaries for the trigger of their transient high frequency qpos .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for their useful insights and suggestions .",
