    "when extreme - value statistics are applied to time series it is common to proceed as though the data are independent and identically distributed , although they may be nonstationary with complex covariate effects and with rare events generated by several different mechanisms .",
    "moreover , models that are mathematically justified only as asymptotic approximations may be fitted to data for which these approximations are poor . in this paper",
    "we suggest diagnostics for failure of these models and illustrate their application .",
    "a standard approach to modeling the upper tail of a distribution is the so - called peaks over threshold procedure [ @xcite ] , under which a threshold @xmath1 is applied to data @xmath2 from a supposedly stationary time series , leaving  @xmath3 positive exceedances @xmath4 .",
    "extrapolation beyond the tail of the data is based on a fit of the generalized pareto distribution [ @xcite ] @xmath5 to the @xmath3 exceedances , treated as independent .",
    "the parameters in ( [ gpd ] ) are a scale parameter @xmath6 and a shape parameter @xmath7 that controls the weight of the tail of the distribution , whose @xmath8th moment exists only if @xmath9 . in many applications @xmath10 appears to lie in the interval @xmath11 , but uncertainty about its value generally leads to alarmingly wide confidence intervals for quantities of interest such as a return period @xmath12 or a return level @xmath13 ; these satisfy @xmath14 .",
    "if the time series is white noise , @xmath15 is large and @xmath16 is small , then exceedances of @xmath1 appear as a poisson process , and under mild conditions we may use the tail approximation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the estimate of ( [ gpd ] ) .",
    "a crucial preliminary to using such methods is the choice of threshold @xmath1 , which is usually performed graphically using stability properties of ( [ gpd ] ) : if @xmath19 and @xmath20 , then conditional on @xmath21 the exceedance @xmath22 has distribution  ( [ gpd ] ) with parameters  @xmath10 and @xmath23 ; and if @xmath24 , then the mean residual life @xmath25 .",
    "it is standard practice to plot empirical versions of these quantities for a range of potential thresholds , and to use only values of @xmath1 above which the estimates appear to be stable and the empirical mean residual life appears to be linear .",
    "see coles [ ( @xcite ) , chapter  4 ] or @xcite for more details , and @xcite and @xcite for variants of the last plot intended to stabilize it in the presence of heavy - tailed data .",
    "this approach to tail modeling is based on a general and well - developed probabilistic theory of extremes [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] and is widely used : in 2008 alone the web of science records around 450 articles in which the terms `` peaks over threshold '' or `` generalised pareto distribution '' appear in the abstract or title .",
    "thus , it is important to develop simple tools for diagnosis of the failure of such models .",
    "one source of failure is the choice of threshold .",
    "a bad choice may yield a poor tail approximation , both because the generalized pareto distribution is inappropriate if @xmath1 is too small and because independence assumptions used to fit the model are invalid : in practice , the observations , and therefore the exceedances , are almost always dependent .",
    "this dependence is often reduced by declustering the exceedances , for example , declaring that those lying closer together than a run parameter @xmath0 belong to the same cluster , and fitting ( [ gpd ] ) only to the largest exceedance of each cluster .",
    "however , a poor choice of @xmath0 will give a poor inference , so it is essential to check how the results depend on the choices of threshold @xmath1 and run parameter @xmath0 .",
    "a key issue is thus the effect of possible model misspecification on inference .",

    "the peaks over the threshold model may be justified by a compound poisson process model for the exceedances of a random process above a high threshold [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "this model , which we outline in section  [ subseclik ] , can be checked through the projection of the two - dimensional limiting point process of exceedances onto the time axis : if the projection is misspecified , we should be wary about using peaks over thresholds .",

    "for a first application to real data we use daily minimum summer temperatures from neuchtel from 1 january 1901 to 31 may 2006 .",
    "climatic change raises the question whether changes in temperature extremes can be summarized simply by a smooth variation of the mean and the variance of the entire temperature distribution , or whether there are additional changes in the extremes . the daily summer minimum temperatures at neuchtel show a strong trend in the averages ,",
    "and we investigate whether this is accompanied by a change in the clustering of the extremes .",
    "the data have been carefully homogenized , so such changes should not be due to changes in instrument siting or type , or urban effects .",

    ", we applied the threshold selection procedures mentioned in section  [ sec1 ] and described in more detail by coles [ ( @xcite ) , section  4.3 ] to the entire sequence .",
    "there seems to be stability above the 0.98 quantile , and generalized pareto analysis of the complete sequence showed acceptable diagnostics .",
    "however , figure  [ classic3year ] , which shows these plots when applied separately to three 41-year - long periods centered on the years 1925 , 1955 and 1985 , casts some doubt on the overall results .",
    "we therefore checked model misspecification as a function of time , by centering 41-year long windows successively at 15 july of each year , and calculating the information matrix test defined by equation ( [ misspec_teststat ] ) , for every combination of threshold  @xmath1 and run parameter @xmath0 .",

    "years are indicated above the plots . ]",
    "the three main potential sources of misspecification here are threshold selection , the choice of run parameter and possible nonstationarity , so the test statistics proposed above must depend on these .",
    "figure  [ pihistory ] , which presents the surfaces of @xmath133 for twelve different years , suggests misspecification in the period 19351970 for thresholds around the 0.97- and 0.98-quantile for all run parameters .",
    "smaller instabilities were also found , mostly between 19852000 , though these rarely exceeded the critical @xmath172-quantile .",
    "these two periods roughly coincide with the strongest nonstationarity in the summer mean temperatures : see figure  [ tmintrend ] , in which the most marked periods of change in the 10-year median are in the 1940s and in the 1980s .",

    "the 95% confidence intervals are shown by thin versions of the lines . ]",
    "although our motivation for testing is different from the usual one leading to the definition of the false discovery rate ( fdr ) , the multiple testing setup and the dependence between information matrix tests applied successively in sliding windows should be taken into account when we want to justify the existence of a misspecification region .",
    "our main interest does not lie in the discovery of regions where the null hypothesis of well - specifiedness is rejected at a given level of fdr [ @xcite ] , but in finding those where it can not be rejected . nevertheless , we tested the significance of the departure from the null hypothesis by the procedure proposed in @xcite separately for each @xmath174 pair , and found that the misspecification is significant for all  @xmath0 and for @xmath175 between roughly 19401965 .",
    "the information matrix test was closest to zero at the point @xmath173 , @xmath176 over the whole century , so we chose these for smooth estimation of the extremal index .",
    "figure  [ mle_ints ] shows the resulting locally constant weighted @xmath0-gaps estimates , compared to intervals and to iterative weighted least squares estimates based on 41-year long sliding windows .",
    "the confidence intervals for the @xmath0-gaps estimator are based on asymptotic normality .",
    "nonparametric bootstrap intervals were also calculated , but showed only slight differences mostly in the middle of the century , where the bootstrap interval was slightly wider . the value of @xmath83 dips in the 1950s and in recent years , but overall any evidence for changes in the clustering of summer minimum daily temperatures seems to be weak .",
    "the information matrix test suggests the existence of fluctuations in the time point process of extreme anomalies .",
    "using the ten - year moving window to de - trend the series , and a 41-year window for the information matrix tests and the estimation of the extremal index , only the combination of a high threshold and a relatively high run parameter seem to yield a well - specified model .",
    "the period where the models are misspecified roughly coincides with a local peak in the 10-year moving median of the data set .",
    "changes in the median temperatures may be accompanied by changes in clustering characteristics , but perhaps using a 10-year moving window for de - trending is insufficient to remove mean fluctuations , so the anomalies display traces of residual nonstationarity that then appear in the 41-year moving windows .",
    "our investigation thus emphasizes the importance of an appropriate treatment of long - term trends .",
    "many studies of climate extremes use varying thresholds based on local quantile estimation or on an assumption of a trend of simple parametric form , the first of which corresponds to our ad hoc selection of window length for de - trending ; see , for example , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that model quality is highly sensitive to such choices , so it is necessary to check whether the models are well specified , in order to avoid biased estimates with underestimated variances .",
    "climatological studies commonly directly compare periods of a few decades , which are assumed stationary , but this too should be performed with care . in our study , the time - scale of the fluctuations found at extreme levels is shorter than a few decades on thresholds @xmath177 in the period 19401965 . as this is a period where the global mean temperature based on observational data has a marked local peak ,",
    "this might arise at other stations also , and other climate variables may also show instability on such time - scales .      the rainfall data recorded daily between 1  january 1961 and 31 december 1999 at maiquetia airport in venezuela provide a striking example of the difficulties of using simple extreme - value methods for risk estimation . prior to december 1999 , the annual maxima of the data set were fitted with a gumbel model , with no diagnostics indicating a bad fit .",
    "however , after an unusually wet fortnight in december 1999 , extensive destruction and around 30,000 deaths [ @xcite ] were caused by three consecutive daily precipitation totals of 120 , 410.4 and 290 mm , the largest of which was almost three times greater than the maximum of the preceding 40 years .",
    "the return period for the peak value of 410.4 mm under simple models can be expressed in thousands or even millions of years .",
    "why do classical extreme - value methods fail so catastrophically , and could more sophisticated methods have given a different return period estimate for such an event ?",
    "@xcite apply a bayesian approach to the point process representation [ @xcite ] , which is essentially equivalent to fitting the generalized pareto distribution .",
    "they use a threshold corresponding approximately to the 0.96-quantile and including all exceedances , and argue in favor of partitioning the sequence into two seasons , the one of interest being from mid - november to april . with these refinements , they obtain a predictive return period of approximately 150 years for 410.4 mm . however , the classical threshold selection plots for these months , shown in the left three panels of figure  [ ven_clasdiag ] , indicate trouble with the model : parameter stability is compatible with the confidence intervals only for thresholds much higher than the 0.96-quantile .",
    "ignoring the tendency of extremes to cluster may also have implications for the estimates and their variance , because the independence assumption is violated .",
    "moreover , which estimate should we choose if different methods give very different answers ?",
    "following @xcite and backed by meteorological information , we took only the months december  april , initially excluding december 1999 , and calculated our diagnostics for @xmath178 $ ] and @xmath179 .",
    "the graph of the statistic @xmath133 in the rightmost panel of figure  [ ven_clasdiag ] displays three clear features : a region of misspecification at thresholds below the 0.96-quantile ; a ridge along the 0.98-quantile with relatively higher values than the surrounding region , corresponding to the most marked instability interval in the classical threshold selection plots ; and higher test statistic values for @xmath180 , implying misspecification for combinations with @xmath181 , @xmath182 .",
    "the best regions appear to be either @xmath183 , @xmath184 or @xmath185 , @xmath184 , but there is no further indication which is preferable , and because of the ridge , the existence of a contiguous area of well - specifiedness is doubtful .     as a function of the run parameter @xmath0 and the threshold @xmath1 on the probability scale @xmath169 . ]     for both .",
    "the same plots for model fits including december 1999 , with the same thresholds and run parameters , are presented in the bottom row .",
    "each panel shows the ordered data ( @xmath186 ) with a line representing the fitted model and a pointwise 95% envelope . ]    the generalized pareto model ( [ gpd ] ) was fitted with @xmath187 , @xmath184 and @xmath173 , @xmath184 .",
    "the resulting parameter estimates and standard errors are very different : @xmath188 , @xmath189 for 0.97 quantile , and @xmath190 , @xmath191 for the 0.99 quantile .",
    "corresponding diagnostic plots are shown in the upper row of figure  [ ven_diag ] , the left two plots referring to the lower threshold , and the right two to the higher .",
    "neither model seems poor , but they give very different return periods for the value 410.4 mm : approximately 600 years for the model with threshold @xmath192 , and an unreasonable 30 million years for the other .",
    "the catastrophe seems to be compatible only with the lower threshold model , despite the fact that in extreme - value statistics , models above higher thresholds are generally considered to be closer to the limiting distribution .",
    "inclusion of december 1999 does not change the misspecification tests much , but changes the estimates to @xmath193 , @xmath194 for the lower threshold and @xmath195 , @xmath196 for the higher one .",
    "the corresponding return periods become @xmath197 and @xmath198 years , respectively . a look at the diagnostic plots in the bottom row of figure  [ ven_diag ]",
    "confirms that the former model admits the catastrophe quite smoothly , whereas it remains an outlier in the latter .",
    "one explanation of this apparent paradox might be that the underlying process is a mixture .",
    "rainfall is generated by different atmospheric processes , such as convective storms , cold fronts or orographic winds .",
    "if so in this case , the observed extreme process corresponds to the extremes of a mixture distribution @xmath199 with the component distribution functions @xmath200 appearing with probabilities @xmath201 , where the @xmath200 could have different extreme - value limits : with @xmath202 , for example , @xmath203 might correspond to the short - tailed case @xmath204 and @xmath205 to the long - tailed case @xmath206 .",
    "such a mixture can show unstable behavior like that of figure  [ ven_clasdiag ] , which hints at the presence of at least two components : a more frequent light - tailed one with relatively high location and scale parameters , dominating the levels around the 0.99-quantile , and a rarer heavy - tailed one concentrated at lower levels and having a smaller scale parameter , but generating extremely large observations occasionally .",
    "a more sophisticated model for the clustering of extremes also suggests a mixture character , but will be reported elsewhere .",
    "this failure of simple extreme - value techniques is a warning to beware of oversimplification , and suggests that an approach linking atmospheric physics and statistical methods would provide better risk estimates .",
    "inference about the extremal behavior of a process involves assumptions such as asymptotic independence at extreme levels and stationarity , and also entails the selection of auxiliary quantities such as threshold and run parameters in order to apply asymptotic models with finite samples .",
    "careful investigation of possible model misspecification is therefore essential .    in this paper",
    "we have applied standard methods of detecting misspecification to the point mass - exponential mixture model ( [ mxtexp ] ) for the inter - exceedance times .",
    "these tests assist in the selection of the threshold and the run parameter @xmath0 and thus help to provide better estimates of both the extremal index and of the generalized pareto distribution .",
    "failure of the model ( [ mxtexp ] ) indicates failure of a more general limit , and consequently of the gpd approximation  ( [ gpd ] ) .",
    "analysis of the venezuelan rainfall data shows that misspecification tests can provide a valuable supplement to classical threshold selection procedures , can lead to improved models and better variance estimates , and may yield further insight into the structure of the data .",
    "we have also described a maximum likelihood estimator for the extremal index , based on the point mass - exponential model ( [ mxtexp ] ) and on the existence of a selection procedure for @xmath0 .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal under an appropriate choice of @xmath0 , and shows small asymptotic bias and root mean square error compared to the best competing estimators .",
    "the joint application of the misspecification tests and the smoothed maximum likelihood estimator proved the good properties of the procedure as an efficient method to detect violations of underlying assumptions such as nonstationarity or indicate other model problems like mixture character that can not be disregarded using finite thresholds",
    ". it can be therefore a useful aid to fine - tuning parameters of extreme - value models or investigating their limitations .",
    "one natural question is whether the assessment of misspecification for extremal models might better be based on ( [ gpd ] ) .",
    "the difficulty with this is that the @xmath8th moment of the score statistic for @xmath10 exists only if @xmath207 , so the maximum likelihood estimators of @xmath10 and @xmath62 are regular only if @xmath208 [ @xcite ] and the observed information has finite variance only if @xmath209 , and information quantities for  ( [ gpd ] ) have poor finite - sample properties .",
    "the distribution  ( [ mxtexp ] ) , on the other hand , is regular for @xmath210 , and so has no such disadvantages .",
    "assume that @xmath211 satisfy the necessary conditions for theorem  [ theo_kgapconv ] .",
    "for a threshold @xmath54 , suppose that @xmath212 observations exceed the threshold @xmath87 .",
    "let the indices @xmath213 denote the times of the exceedances , and let @xmath214 denote the @xmath45th observed @xmath0-gap @xmath215 normalized by the tail probability @xmath216 for @xmath91 and @xmath217 then , denoting derivatives with respect to @xmath83 by a prime , it follows from the likelihood ( [ goodloglik ] ) that @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the indicator function of the set @xmath220 .",
    "then we can derive the one - observation version , the sample mean of the difference @xmath221 between the variance of the score and the fisher information and the sample variance of the latter as @xmath222 and from there , the information matrix test statistic is obtained by substituting the appropriate quantities and the estimated value of @xmath223 as @xmath224",
