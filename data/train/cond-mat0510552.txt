    "an important theorem by dyson , lieb , and simon ( dls ) states that the heisenberg hamiltonian on bipartite lattices with @xmath3 have long - range order in the ground state @xcite .",
    "we now know from quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite that this result extends to @xmath0 systems .",
    "there is current interest as to how a disordered state emerges out of the nel state .",
    "this question is important to the physics of frustrated materials where some systems exhibit no magnetic order down to the experimentally accessible temperatures and are thus believed to be disordered in the ground state .",
    "a disordered phase may also be relevant in the theory of high temperature superconductors .",
    "this issue and the related one of the eventual role of berry phases was hotly debated in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s soon after the discovery of the high @xmath4 materials @xcite . many possible disordered states were proposed but none of them gained consensus . for an extensive discussion on this topic , we refer the reader to the book by fradkin @xcite .    in the search of the nature of a ground state of a quantum hamiltonian , there is another useful theorem by lieb , schultz , and mattis ( lsm)@xcite , initially formulated for 1d systems and later extended to 2d systems by affleck @xcite restricts the possible ground states of half - integer spin systems .",
    "either the ground state is degenerate , ( presumably due to a broken symmetry ) or it is unique and gapless without any long - range order . for heisenberg hamiltonians , the latter possibility appears difficult to realize in 2d because dimer - dimer or spin - spin correlations have a power law decay in 1d .",
    "it would thus be expected that interchain couplings will lead to long - range order in one of the two channels .",
    "if the magnetic order is frustrated , a dimerization would be expected .",
    "frustrated spin models often involve competitions between two magnetic orders , the expected dimerized phase is believed to lie between these magnetic phases . a possible alternative to this scenario allowed by the lsm theorem",
    "is the occurence of a disordered gapless state at transition between the magnetic phases .    in recent publications @xcite ,",
    "we have studied the possible emergence of a disordered state in a model of coupled heisenberg chains .",
    "this model is a spatially anisotropic version of the well studied @xmath5 model .",
    "the model essentially retains the physics of the @xmath5 model : it presents a phase transition between two magnetic phases .",
    "the first phase is a nel phase characterized by the ordering wave vector @xmath6 .",
    "the order parameter in this phase is maximal in absence of the diagonal coupling @xmath7 .",
    "it decreases as @xmath7 is increased until it vanishes at the maximally frustrated point . beyond this point ,",
    "another nel state with @xmath8 becomes the ground state .",
    "the existence of these two phases was predicted in numerous studies @xcite of the isotropic ( @xmath9 ) version of this model .",
    "but what has caused the continuing interest into this simple model is the question of whether there is an intermediate phase between these two magnetic phases .",
    "simple physical arguments suggest the existence of such a phase because the two states are associated with subgroups of the @xmath10 symmetry group of the spin hamiltonian and of the @xmath11 symmetry group of the square lattice that neither include each other . from the landau theory we know that a continuous transition from these two phases is forbidden .",
    "initial suggestions for the possible intermediate phase was the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) @xcite phase , flux phases @xcite , chiral spin liquid @xcite or the spin - peierls ( sp ) @xcite . the sp phase has lately emerged as the front runner .",
    "it causes the same type of difficulty as the direct transition between two magnetic phases . since in that case",
    ", the transition is between a magnetic state that breaks the spin rotational symmetry but not the lattice translational symmetry to a dimerized state that breaks the lattice translational symmetry but not the spin rotational symmetry .",
    "the transition to sp phase has triggered interesting proposal of an extension of the conventional landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) theory of second order phase transition@xcite .",
    "it seems , however , that this theory does not apply to the @xmath5 model , where we did not find any evidence of an intermediate phase for @xmath0 .",
    "numerical data suggests a transition , which seems to be of second order , between the two magnetic phases at the maximally frustrated point for both the anisotropic and isotropic models @xcite . at the transition point , the competing magnetic orders neutralize each other and the system behaves like a collection of loosely bound chains , even if the bare interactions are not small .",
    "classically , the ground state is degenerate at this point .",
    "this degeneracy is lifted by quantum fluctuations . in ref.@xcite , we have shown that among all the possible clusters , chains offer the best compromise between minimizing the energy and avoiding frustration at the same time . at the maximally frustrated point ,",
    "the transverse interactions seem to be irrelevant .",
    "i.e. , up to the largest lattice size studied , transverse spin - spin correlations decay exponentially and the longitudinal correlations revert to those of decoupled chains .",
    "this disordered state is a singlet and gapless consistent with the lsm theorem@xcite .",
    "it is reminiscent of a sliding luttinger liquid ( sll ) found in models of coupled fermions chains @xcite .",
    "it thus appears that the intermediate region where a disordered phase has long been thought to exist is just a critical region .",
    "that is the reason why it has resisted various approaches for nearly two decades . at the maximally frustated point ,",
    "the correlation functions are 1d - like , thus the rotational spin symmetry of the system is restored .",
    "in fact such a transition between these two magnetic phases already exists in the unfrustred model when the transverse exchange parameter , @xmath12 , is varied from positive values to negative values . at the point @xmath13 ,",
    "there is a transition from 2d to 1d , where properties are identical to that of the maximally frustrated point .",
    "the only difference between the case @xmath13 and the maximally frustrated point is the presence of irrelevant transverse terms which do not change the long distance behavior of the correlation functions as shown in ref.@xcite . from this result",
    "the lgw theory applies if it is assumed that the system s group of symmetry at the critical point contains the groups of symmetry of the two magnetic phases .",
    "it is important to study how this interesting physics extends to larger spin systems .",
    "first , because many frustrated systems contain larger spins .",
    "second , because there are some interesting predictions from large @xmath14 approaches about the emergence of a disordered phase from a nel phase as function of @xmath14 .",
    "affleck @xcite argued that since the lsm theorem does not apply to integer spin systems , there might be a distinction between integer and half - integer spin systems in 2d as well .",
    "haldane @xcite discussed that in addition to the now well - established distinct behavior between half - integer and integer spins in one dimension @xcite , there might be a difference between odd and even integer spins in two dimensions due to the effects of the berry phase .",
    "read and sachdev carried out a large @xmath15 analysis of the possible disordered phase as function of the value of the large @xmath15 equivalent of the spin .",
    "their results were consistent with haldane s predictions .",
    "three types of disordered states were predicted . for half - integer spins ,",
    "the non - magnetic phase is a sp phase which breaks the translational symmetry along the two directions of the square lattice . for odd integer spins ,",
    "the non - magnetic state is made of weakly - coupled chains , i.e. , the translational symmetry is broken along one direction only . finally for even integer spins ,",
    "the disordered state are valence bond solids , like the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) state@xcite , i.e , it does not break any translational symmetry .    in the large @xmath14 approaches",
    "the heisenberg model is mapped onto the non - linear sigma model ( @xmath16 ) with a berry phase term .",
    "this mapping is only approximate@xcite and there can be some subtle differences with the original model@xcite . indeed , the realization of the haldane conjecture in 1d shows their power .",
    "but , in absence of exact results for small @xmath14 , it is impossible to know whether their predictions of a disordered phase extends to small @xmath14 .",
    "another potential problem is that the mapping to the @xmath17-model assumes the presence of a smooth configuration of spins .",
    "this is true in the weak - coupling regime ( nel ordered phase ) .",
    "but this assumption may break down in the strong coupling regime ( disordered phase ) . in one dimension , the @xmath17-model coupling constant",
    "is given by @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "thus for @xmath0 , the equivalence between the two models breaks down at @xmath19 , i.e. , close to the transition to a dimerized state .",
    "such a breakdown seems to occur in the @xmath5 model where , as seen above , the large @xmath15 predictions conflict for @xmath0 with the tsdmrg in the @xmath5 model .",
    "but since spin - half integer systems are critical , it could be objected that the behavior seen in our numerical studies are due to finite size effects . for large enough lattices",
    "there might be a relevant interaction which can drive the system to a sp phase as predicted from large @xmath15 .",
    "though this scenario appears to be unlikely , as discussed in ref.@xcite , it can not be completely rejected . in principle",
    ", one would expect a different behavior for integer spin systems which are known to have a spin gap in 1d @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we applied the tsdmrg to study @xmath0 , @xmath20 , @xmath21, ...",
    ",@xmath22 systems in the anisotropic 2d hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "our results in the absence of frustration are in agreement with the dls theorem ref.@xcite .",
    "we find that for all @xmath14 the ground state is ordered in the absence of frustration . for all",
    "@xmath14 except for @xmath0 , the order parameter is large enough so that the extrapolated value are reliable .",
    "this result constitutes a non - trivial test of the tsdmrg , since the tsdmrg starts from decoupled chains which are disordered .",
    "when the frustration is turned on , the general mechanism found for the destruction of the nel phase is the severing of the frustrated bonds in the transverse direction , leading to a disordered state with the transverse correlations that decay exponentially at the critical point as previously found for @xmath0 . however , a different conclusion is to be drawn for half - integer @xmath14 and for integer @xmath14 for which the lsm theorem does not apply .",
    "all half - integer systems are similar to @xmath0 .",
    "the disordered state is confined at the critical point , it has a sll character .",
    "but for integer @xmath14 , because of the haldane gap @xmath23 in the chain , there is an intermediate phase whose width is roughly @xmath24 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the model and the method . in section ( [ spin1 ] ) ,",
    "we present extensive results for @xmath25 systems .",
    "this analysis is similar to the one made for spin @xmath26 systems in ref.@xcite . in section ( [ spins ] ) the results for systems with @xmath0 to @xmath22",
    "are presented . in section ( [ conclusions ] ) , we present our conclusions .",
    "we apply the tsdmrg @xcite to the spatially anisotropic heisenberg hamiltonian ,    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the intra - chain exchange parameter and is set to 1 ; @xmath12 and @xmath7 are respectively the transverse and diagonal interchain exchanges .",
    "this model is the object of current interest @xcite .",
    "it is a starting point of understanding the @xmath5 model which is recovered when @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "it retains the basic physics of the @xmath5 model and has the advantage that in the limit @xmath31 , well tested 1d results can be used to initialize a perturbative rg analysis .      in the tsdmrg , to study a 2d lattice of size @xmath32 ( we will refer to the 2d systems only by their linear dimension @xmath33 ) , we start by applying the usual 1d dmrg ( @xmath34 states are kept ) or exact diagonalization ( ed ) to a single chain @xmath35 of length @xmath33 to obtain @xmath36 low lying eigenstates and eigenvalues , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , respectively .",

    "the tsdmrg is perturbative ; but the expansion is made onto the smaller term of the hamiltonian itself not on the green s function or the ground - state wave function .",
    "we have shown that starting from a disordered state , the tsdmrg is able to reach the ordered state without any addition of a term that explicitly breaks the symmetry such as a magnetic field .",
    "the tsdmrg was tested against the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method in ref.(@xcite ) and against ed in ref.(@xcite ) .",
    "the tsdmrg is variational , its performance can systematically be improved by increasing @xmath34 and @xmath36 .",
    "key indicators about the performance of the tsdmrg are the truncation error @xmath47 during the first step , the width @xmath48 of the @xmath36 states kept and the truncation error @xmath49 during the second step . in principle , it is necessary that the ratio of @xmath48 over the transverse coupling be large for the tsdmrg to yield great accuracy .",

    ", @xmath47 is small , the tsdmrg method can reach the qmc accuracy .",
    "so far , this has been achieved only for small couplings @xmath51 and lattice sizes of up to @xmath52 keeping up to @xmath53 .",
    "the amount of calculations involved remains modest and so far are done on a workstation .",
    "the accuracy decreases by increasing @xmath12 leading to less accurate results in the ordered state .",
    "but when both @xmath12 and @xmath7 are turned on , the performance of the tsdmrg becomes more complex as we will see below .    in this work ,",
    "the calculations for @xmath25 were performed similarly to those for spin @xmath0 systems in ref.@xcite . in most cases ,",
    "ed was applied during the first step . in some case , i.e , some runs of @xmath54 and all runs of @xmath55 , a single dmrg iteration was used .",
    "for instance for @xmath54 and @xmath25 , when @xmath56 states are kept , a single @xmath57 iteration is necessary to reach desired size . for this calculation",
    ", we kept up to @xmath53 states during the second tsdmrg step . for the maximum performance of the algorithm ,",
    "it is necessary that @xmath12 be in the order of the finite size gap of the single chain @xmath58 . for @xmath25 , @xmath59",

    "a second condition to fulfill is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the width of the retained eigenvalues .",

    "these results lead us to conclude that the maximally frustrated point is a quantum critical point ( qcp ) between the two magnetic states ( the second magnetic state is stable when @xmath106 ) . a possible argument against this conclusion",

    "we are indeed aware of earlier ed results @xcite in which an enhancement of the sp susceptibility was observed in the regime @xmath190 .",
    "we believe in the light of our results that this merely the consequence of the severing of the chains in one of the two directions of the square lattice .",
    "the sp signal is expected to be larger in 1d where it has a power law decay than in 2d when the spins are locked into nel order in the unfrustrated regime .    for integer spins , there is an intermediate phase between the two magnetic states . when @xmath191 , where @xmath132 is the single chain spin gap , the transverse coupling are irrelevant .",
    "the maximally frustrated point is the equivalent of the disordered point seen in 1d . in this regime of couplings ,",
    "the system is an assembly of nearly decoupled chains . in the case of integer spins ,",
    "even if there is a residual interaction at the maximally frustrated point , this interaction is necessary irrelevant because of the presence of @xmath132 .",
    "integer spin systems are thus radically different from half - odd integer systems .",
    "in this paper , we used the tsdmrg to study coupled spin chains with @xmath14 varying from @xmath26 to @xmath22 .",
    "this study illustrates the power of the tsdmrg method , where using a modest computer effort we were able to study the unfrustrated regime and find long - range magnetic order , in agreement with the dls theorem and monte carlo studies .",
    "we obtained good accuracy in the highly frustrated regime of the model .",
    "the study of this region has so far resisted to other numerical methods .",
    "we showed that in order to avoid frustration , all spin systems tend to sever the frustrated bonds .",
    "the severing of the transverse bonds is a large effect which is seen in various physical quantities .",
    "the strong frustration regime is dominated by 1d physics , topological effects become important as predicted in ref.(@xcite ) .",
    "however , we did not find any qualitative difference between odd and even integer spin systems as predicted in ref.(@xcite ) .",
    "it could be due to the fact that in the highly frustrated regime the 2d systems tend to relax into nearly independent 1d sytems where tolological effects are identical for odd and even integer spins .",
    "it could also be related to the anisotropy of the model studied .",
