    "hot jupiters are gas giant planets found in tight orbits around their parent stars , with a large number now known to transit their host star and are amenable to atmospheric investigations .",
    "this wide class of exoplanets span a very large range in equilibrium temperatures , with most planets ranging from 1000 to 3000 k depending on the albedo and efficiency of heat transfer from the day to night side . at these temperatures , theoretical models of hot jupiters have predominately predicted atmospheres which are dominated by water opacity in the near - ir , with the optical containing alkali features and scattering by hydrogen molecules ( e.g. @xcite ) .    for highly irradiated hot jupiter atmospheres , the expectation of alkali metals leads to very low predicted albedos .",
    "this expectation has generally been backed up by observations , both from the detection of na ( @xcite ) and k atoms as well as the generally low albedos found in many hot jupiters such as hd  209458b @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric temperatures of the hot jupiters are close to the condensation temperature of several abundant components , including silicates and iron , making clouds and hazes a natural outcome of chemistry in much the same way as abundant h@xmath3o , co , and ch@xmath7 molecules in gaseous form . the possible presence of such condensation clouds was considered early on @xcite . according to models",
    ", condensates would weaken spectral features , or mask some of them , depending on the height of the cloud deck @xcite .",
    "there is a growing body of evidence for substantial clouds and hazes in hot jupiters , including the transmission spectra of hd  189733b , wasp-12b , hat - p-32b , and wasp-6b @xcite . here",
    "we present results for wasp-31b from a large _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) programme ( _ hst _ go-12473 ; p.i .",
    "sing ) , consisting of an eight planet optical atmospheric survey of transiting hot jupiters .",
    "the overall programme goals are to detect atmospheric features across a wide range of hot - jupiter atmospheres enabling comparative exoplanetology , detect stratosphere causing agents like tio @xcite , and detect alkali atoms as well as hazes and clouds . in the results reported so far for this survey , @xcite detected h@xmath3o in wasp-19b and found tio was unlikely .",
    "water was also found in hat - p-1b @xcite with the broad - band spectrum also showing na  i and a significant optical absorber but no k  i absorption @xcite .",
    "finally , tio was ruled out in the very hot planet wasp-12b and the atmosphere was found to be dominated by aerosols , with corundum a possible candidate that is particularly relevant given its high condensation temperature applicable to this very - hot jupiter @xcite .",
    "wasp-31b was discovered by as part of the wide angle search for planets survey . with a low mass ( 0.46 m@xmath8 ) and large inflated radius ( 0.155 r@xmath8 )",
    "the planet is of particular interest to atmospheric studies as it has a very low density ( @xmath9=0.129 @xmath10 ) and correspondingly low surface gravity of 4.56 m @xmath11 making the planet very favorable to transmission spectroscopy .",
    "the exoplanet orbits at 0.047 au around a f6v 6300  k low metallicity ( [ fe / h]=-0.19 ) low activity  3 - 5 gyr star , and has a nominal ( zero albedo , full recirculation ) equilibrium temperature of 1570  k . in this paper , we present new _",
    "hst _ transit observations with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) and wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) in spacial scanning mode , combining them with _ spitzer _",
    "photometry to construct a high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) near - uv to infrared transmission spectrum of wasp-31b , capable of detecting and scrutinising atmospheric constituents .",
    "we describe our observations in sect .",
    "2 , present the analysis of the transit light curves in sect .",
    "3 , discuss the results in sect . 4 and conclude in sect .",
    "the overall observational strategy for wasp-31b is nearly identical for each of the eight targets in the large _ hst _ programme , including the wasp-19b , hat - p-1b , and wasp-12b which have been published in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we observed two transits of wasp-31b with the _ hst _ stis @xmath12430@xmath13 grating during 2012 june 13 and 2012 june 26 , as well as one transit with the stis @xmath12750@xmath13 during 2012 july 10 .",
    "the @xmath12430@xmath13 and @xmath12750@xmath13 data sets each contain 43 spectra , which span five spacecraft orbits .",
    "the @xmath12430@xmath13 grating covers the wavelength range from 2,900 to 5,700   , with a resolution @xmath14 of @xmath15/@xmath165301,040 ( @xmath52 pixels ; 5.5   ) .",
    "the @xmath12750@xmath13 grating covers the wavelength range from 5,240 to 10,270   , with a @xmath175301,040 ( @xmath52 pixels ; 9.8   ) .",
    "both the stis data were taken with a wide 52 arcsec@xmath18 arcsec slit to minimize slit light losses .",
    "the visits of _ hst _ were scheduled such that the third and fourth spacecraft orbits contain the transit , providing good coverage between second and third contact , as well as an out - of - transit baseline time series before and after the transit .",
    "exposure times of 279 s were used in conjunction with a 128-pixel wide sub - array , which reduces the readout time between exposures to 21 s , providing a 93 per cent overall duty cycle .",
    "the data set was pipeline - reduced with the latest version of calstis , and cleaned for cosmic ray detections with a customised procedure based on median - combining difference images following @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12750@xmath13 data set was defringed using contemporaneous fringe flats .",
    "the mid - time of each exposure was converted into bjd@xmath19 for use in the transit light curves @xcite .",
    "the spectral aperture extraction was done with iraf using a 13-pixel - wide aperture with no background subtraction , which minimises the out - of - transit standard deviation of the white - light curves .",
    "the extracted spectra were then doppler - corrected to a common rest frame through cross - correlation , which helped remove sub - pixel wavelength shifts in the dispersion direction .",
    "the stis spectra were then used to create both a white - light photometric time series ( see fig .",
    "[ figwhite ] ) , and custom wavelength bands covering the spectra , integrating the appropriate wavelength flux from each exposure for different bandpasses .      like",
    "the other targets in our _ hst _ programme , the stis light curves of wasp-31 show instrument - related systematic effects primarily due to the well known thermal breathing of _ hst _ , which warms and cools the telescope during the 96 min day / night orbital cycle , causing the focus to vary .",
    "the first exposure of each spacecraft orbit has also consistently been found to show significantly lower fluxes than the remaining exposures .",
    "similar to our previous stis analysis @xcite , we intended to discard the entire first orbit to minimise the effect of the breathing trend , but found for two of the three _ hst _ visits , a few of the exposures taken toward the end of the first orbit could be used in the analysis and fit with the same systematics model as used for the subsequent orbits .",
    "in addition , we set the exposure time of the first image of each spacecraft orbit to be 1 second in duration , such that it could be discarded without significant loss in observing time .",
    "we find that the second exposures taken for all five spacecraft orbits ( each 279 s in duration ) do not in general show the first - exposure systematic trend , with an exception of the third orbit of the @xmath12750@xmath13 light curve . upon analysing several targets from the large _ hst _ programme , the 1-second strategy",
    "to avoid the faint exposure systematic appears to have mixed results . for both wasp-19b , wasp-12b , and here for wasp-31b the second exposures of each spacecraft orbit do not generally show the first - exposure trend as intended , though the exposures of hat - p-1b were still affected .",
    "though the 1-second strategy may not always be effective , especially for brighter targets , it still appears to be a recommended practice for stis programmes requiring high photometric accuracy and long exposures as it can often save useful observing time as was usually the case here .",
    "in addition to the stis data , observations of wasp-31b were also conducted in the infrared with wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the _",
    "hst_. observations began on 2012 may 13 at 12:53 using the ir @xmath12141 grism in forward spatial scan mode over 5 _ hst _ orbits .",
    "the spacial scanning is done by slewing the telescope in the cross - dispersion direction during integration in a similar manner for each exposure , which increases the duty cycle and greatly increases the number of counts obtained per exposure .",
    "we used a 256 @xmath20 256 pixel subarray with the spars25 nsamp=8 readout sequence , which gives exposure times of 134.35 s. our observations were conducted with a spatial scan rate of @xmath50.15 pixels per second , where 1 pixel = 0.13 arcsec , with the final spatially scanned spectrum spanning @xmath520 pixels .",
    "the @xmath12141 grism images contain only the 1st order spectrum , which spans 143 pixels with a dispersion of 4.63 nm / pixel in the direction of the @xmath21-axis .",
    "the resultant spectra have average count rates of about 3.8@xmath22 electrons per pixel .",
    "we used the  _",
    "i m a _ \" outputs from the calwfc3 pipeline . for each exposure , _ calwf3 _ conducts the following processes : reference pixel subtraction , zero - read and dark current subtraction , and a non - linearity correction ; the resultant images are in units of electrons per second . for the spectral extraction",
    ", we trimmed a 152@xmath2080 box around each spectral image and the spectra were extracted using custom idl routines , similar to iraf s apall procedure , with an aperture of @xmath2312 pixels determined by minimising the standard deviation of the fitted white - light curve .",
    "the aperture is traced around a computed centring profile , which was found to be consistent in the @xmath24-axis with an error of 0.06 pixels .",
    "background subtraction was applied using a clean region of the untrimmed image , with background accounting for 0.4% of the total flux measured in each wavelength column .",
    "subsequent data analysis was conducted with the first orbit removed ( 16 exposures ) , as it suffers from significant thermal breathing systematic effects similar to the stis data .    for wavelength calibration , direct images were taken in the @xmath25139@xmath26 narrow band filter at the beginning of the observations .",
    "we assumed that all pixels in the same column have the same effective wavelength , as the spatial scan varied in the @xmath21-axis direction by less than one pixel , resulting in a spectral range from 1.1 - 1.7  @xmath0 m .",
    "this wavelength range is later restricted for the spectroscopic light curve fits as the strongly sloped edges of the grism response result in much lower s / n light curves .",
    "we analyse two transit observations obtained using the irac instrument ( programme 90092 with p.i .",
    "desert ) on the spitzer space telescope in the 3.6  @xmath27 and 4.5  @xmath27 channels in subarray mode ( 32@xmath2032 pixel , or 39@xmath28 centred on the planet s host ) .",
    "the 3.6  @xmath29 observation was performed on ut 2013 march 9 ( between 06:59 and 11:37 ) and the 4.5 observation was performed on ut 2013 march 19 ( between 12:19 and 16:58 ) , each transit containing 8320 images ( see fig . [",
    "figure : spitzer ] ) .",
    "photometry was extracted from the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) files .",
    "these images are stacked in fits data cubes , containing 64 exposures taken in a sequence which were produced by the irac pipeline ( version s19.1.0 ) after dark subtraction , flat - fielding , linearization and flux calibration .",
    "both observations have effective integration times of 1.92s per image .",
    "we converted the images to photon counts ( i.e. electrons ) by multiplying the images by the gain and individual exposure times ( fits header key words samptime and gain ) and dividing by the flux conversion factor ( fluxconv ) .",
    "timing of each image was computed using the utc - based barycentric julian date ( @xmath30 ) from the fits header keyword bmjd_obs , transforming these time stamps into barycentric julian date based on the bjd terrestrial time ( tt ) standard @xcite .",
    "both channels show a strong ramp feature at the beginning of the data , and we elected to trim the first 22 min of data to allow the detector to stabilise .",
    "we performed outlier filtering for hot ( energetic ) or cold ( low count values ) pixels in the data by examining the time series of each pixel .",
    "this task was performed in two passes , first flagging all pixels with intensity 8-@xmath4 or more away from the median value computed for each frame from the 10 surrounding images .",
    "the values of these flagged pixels were replaced with the local median value . in the second pass",
    ", we flagged and replaced outliers above the 4-@xmath4 level , following the same procedure .",
    "the total fraction of corrected pixels was 0.26 per cent for the 3.6  @xmath0 m and 0.07 per cent for the 4.5  @xmath0 m .",
    "we estimated and subtracted the background flux from each image of the time series . to do this",
    "we performed an iterative 3-@xmath4 outlier clipping for each image to remove the pixels with values associated with the stellar psf , background stars or hot pixels , created a histogram from the remaining pixels , and fitted a gaussian to determine the sky background .",
    "we measured the position of the star on the detector in each image incorporating the flux - weighted centroiding method using the background subtracted pixels from each image for a circular region with radius 3 pixels centred on the approximate position of the star . while we could perform psf centroiding using alternative methods such as fitting a two - dimensional gaussian function to the stellar image , previous experiences with warm  photometry showed that the flux - weighted centroiding method is either equivalent or superior @xcite .",
    "the variation of the @xmath21 and @xmath24 positions of the stellar psf on the detector were 0.17 and 0.18 pixels for the @xmath31 channel and 0.76 and 0.24 pixels for the @xmath32 channel .",
    "we extract photometric measurements from our data following two methods .",
    "first , aperture photometry was performed with idl routine aper using circular apertures ranging in radius from 1.5 to 3.5 pixels in increments of 0.1 .",
    "the best result was selected by measuring the flux scatter of the out - of - transit portion of the light curves for both channels after filtering the data for 5-@xmath4 outliers with a width of 20 data points .",
    "in addition we also performed photometry with a time - variable aperture , adjusting the size of the aperature for each image with the noise pixel parameter @xcite , which is described in section 2.2.2 of the irac instrument handbook and has been used in previous exoplanet studies to improve the results of warm spritzer photometry ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the noise pixel parameter is proportional to the fwhm of the stellar point - spread function squared @xcite and is defined as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the intensity detected by the @xmath35th pixel .",
    "we use each image to measure the noise pixel value , applying an aperture with a radius 4 pixels , ensuring that each pixel is considered if the border of the aperture crosses that pixel .",
    "we extracted source fluxes from both channel time series for aperture radii , @xmath36 , following the relation : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 were respectively varied in the ranges 0.8 to 1.2 and -0.4 to + 0.4 with a step size of 0.1 .       :",
