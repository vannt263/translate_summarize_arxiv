    "but it turns out that the latter case is trivial if @xmath8 is divisible by @xmath2 , then @xmath2 necessarily equals @xmath9 .",
    "the set of novk numbers possesses numerous additional structures . for example , unlike in the case of rotkiewicz numbers ( see @xcite ) , i.e. natural numbers @xmath2 with @xmath10 divisible by @xmath2 , it is rather easy to see that there are infinitely many novk numbers .",
    "indeed , 3 is a novk number and the set of novk numbers is closed under gcd , lcm and multiplication ( see section 3 ) , so , for any @xmath11 we have @xmath12 . also , if @xmath2 is a novk number , then so is @xmath13 . to prove this , note that @xmath14 for some positive integer @xmath15 and @xmath15 is odd since it is a factor of odd number @xmath4 .",

    ", we study the distribution of novk numbers , namely , we will obtain some new lower bounds for the number of novk numbers less then a given number @xmath1 . here and further this quantity will be denoted @xmath0 in honor of brtislav novk .",

    "paper @xcite by luca , pomerance , shparlinski and alba gonzlez contains , among many other facts , the following theorem :    for some @xmath21 and all large enough @xmath1 we have    @xmath22    main goal of our paper is to prove a much better lower bound .    there exist a positive constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 such that for any @xmath25 the inequality    @xmath26    is satisfied .",

    "theorems 1 and 2 are also true for some rather general class of sequences .",
    "for example , our considerations are still valid for such @xmath2 that @xmath36 is divisible by @xmath2 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are fixed integers with @xmath39 .    in the fourth section of this work",

    "let @xmath69 be the set of natural numbers not exceeding @xmath2 and not lying in any of fixed residue classes .",
    "then the following estimate for the number of elements in @xmath69 holds :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 .",
    "in this part of the work , we will prove theorems 1 and 2 .",
    "it was already mentioned before that the set of novk numbers carries a lot of structures .",

    "it is a bit harder to prove that product of two novk numbers is a novk number .",
    "this fact can be deduced from the following more general statement :    let @xmath2 be a novk number and @xmath78 be some prime factors of @xmath4 .",

    "if @xmath2 is divisible by @xmath40 , then @xmath85 and , by lifting the exponent lemma , @xmath86 .",
    "thus , @xmath82 is divisible by @xmath2 and @xmath83 .",
    "consequently , it is divisible by @xmath87=np$ ] .",
    "so , @xmath88 is a novk number . repeatedly applying this proposition ,",
    "we obtain the required result .",
    "now , using lemma 5 , we will show that to prove good lower bounds for @xmath0 it is sufficient to construct novk numbers @xmath2 with @xmath4 having many different prime factors .",
    "let @xmath1 be a positive real number and @xmath89 be a novk number with @xmath90 .",
    "then the inequality @xmath91 holds .",
    "if @xmath78 are different prime factors of @xmath4 , then , by the lemma 5 , any number of the form @xmath80 with @xmath92 is a novk number .",
    "we will prove a lower bound for the number of @xmath15-tuples @xmath93 such that the corresponding novk number does not exceed @xmath1 .",
    "+ taking logarithms of both sides of inequality @xmath94 , we get the condition    @xmath95    any @xmath15-tuple , satisfying the conditions @xmath96 for all @xmath97 also obviously satisfies the prevous inequality .",

    ".    it seems reasonable to expect that for any @xmath106 there is a novk number @xmath107 such that @xmath4 has _",
    "normal _ in order number of divisors , that is @xmath108 .",
    "this heuristic together with lemma 6 and the choice @xmath109 gives us the lower bound    @xmath110    which is as strong as theorem 2 for the case @xmath111 .",
    "so , we need to construct novk numbers @xmath4 with _ abnormally large _ number of prime factors .",
    "the next simple consequence of zsigmondy s theorem allows us to deduce some estimates for @xmath112 in terms of arithmetical properties of @xmath2 .    for any odd positive integer @xmath2 the inequality @xmath113 holds .    for any divisor @xmath114 of the number @xmath2",
    ", we can choose , by zsigmondy s theorem , some primitive prime factor @xmath115 of @xmath116 . note that , by primitivity , for @xmath117 we always have @xmath118 .",
    "as @xmath2 is odd and for any @xmath119 we have @xmath120 , @xmath4 is divisible by @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the number of different prime factors of @xmath4 is at least as large , as the number of divisors of @xmath2 that are not equal 3 .",
    "so , this lemma is proved .",
    "lemma 7 has a number of interesting consequences that are useful in the proof of our main theorem .    for any @xmath121 we have @xmath122    for any positive integers @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath15 the following lower bound holds :    @xmath123    first corollary is a straightforward consequence of lemma 7 for the case @xmath124 , as @xmath125 .",
    "the second one easily follows from the inequality @xmath126    and the lemma 7 with @xmath127 .",
    "now we are ready to prove theorem 1 .",
    "suppose that for some @xmath27 and @xmath15 we have @xmath128 .    by the lemma 6 , @xmath129    on the other hand , in virtue of corollary 2 , @xmath130 .",

    "so , for large enough @xmath1 we have    @xmath137    which completes the proof of theorem 1 .    theorem 2",
    "will be deduced from the theorem 1 .    for the convenience , we set    @xmath138    lemma 6 implies :    for any @xmath139 the estimate    @xmath140    holds .",

    ", we have    @xmath143    noting that for @xmath144 the inequality    @xmath145    is satisfied , we arrive at required proposition .",
    "this proves that theorem 2 is implied by the analogous fact about @xmath146 :    for any positive integer @xmath27 there exist positive constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that for any @xmath30 the lower bound    @xmath147    holds .",
    "we remark that from the proof of theorem 1 follows the truth of theorem 3 in the case @xmath111 ( for any @xmath148 ) .",
    "let s prove theorem 3 by induction on @xmath27 .",
    "suppose that    @xmath149    using lemma 7 and the fact that @xmath4 is novk number if @xmath2 is , we get    @xmath150    indeed , if @xmath151 is a novk number with @xmath152 , then @xmath153 is a novk number , too , and by the lemma 7 ,    @xmath154 so , the inequality    @xmath155    holds .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to take any @xmath156 .",
