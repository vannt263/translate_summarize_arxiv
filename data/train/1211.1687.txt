    "conventional phases of matter such as solids or liquids are classically described in the framework of ginzburg - landau symmetry breaking theory of phase transitions @xcite . over 50 years , it was believed that landau theory is capable of describing any phases of matter by introducing an appropriate local order parameter characterizing different behaviors of two phases on either side of the critical point .",
    "discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite , introduced an exotic phase of matter carrying a new kind of quantum order , _ topological order _ , which is beyond the scope of the landau symmetry breaking theory of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "since then , investigation of systems with topological order such as quantum dimer models@xcite , quantum spin models@xcite and superconducting states@xcite became a very active area of research in condensed matter physics .",
    "later on , remarkable characteristics of the topologically ordered system and their robust nature motivated the physicists in the field of quantum information to introduce new models for fault tolerant quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the toric code by kitaev is the first example of error correcting quantum models making use of the topologically degenerate ground state of the system as a robust quantum memory@xcite .",
    "the ground state degeneracy depends on the topology of the system and it can not be lifted by any local perturbation to the hamiltonian",
    ". only non - trivial topological errors are capable of lifting the degenerate ground states of the system @xcite .",
    "the ground states are stabilized by a group of local operators called plaquettes and stars making them useful as an error correcting quantum code .",
    "the gapped excitations above the topologically - ordered ground states correspond to a fascinating class of emerging particles that are neither fermions nor bosons .",
    "these particles are called anyons .",
    "most interestingly , it has been shown that the non - trivial braiding of non - abelian anyons can be used for fault tolerant quantum computation@xcite .",
    "topological color codes are a different class of error correcting quantum codes which allow the implementation of the whole clifford group in a fully topological manner in the ground state space .",
    "the latter makes the platform suitable for quantum computation without resorting to braiding of quasiparticle excitations @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the toric code which is built on tetravalent lattices , the color code is implemented on trivalent structures . moreover",
    ", the toric code belongs to the @xmath0 gauge symmetry group while the topological color code is related to the @xmath1 gauge symmetry group .",
    "this distinction is a direct consequence of the different lattice structure and the way in which plaquette operators are attached to faces on the lattices .",
    "it is worth noting that the topological order in the error correcting quantum codes is directly related to the topology of underlying manifold and especially to string structure of states made of plaquette operators .",
    "thus , in contrast to the symmetry protected topological orders ( spt)@xcite , the topological order in color codes is unrelated to the symmetry . in addition , unlike the spts which are known for gapless excitations on boundary and short - range entanglement@xcite , the topological quantum codes have gapped excitations and long - range entanglement .",
    "the robustness of the protected topological order of the topological color code is a very important issue when it comes to practice .",
    "although the topological degeneracy of the ground state can not be lifted by local perturbations , the question arises as to how much this topological nature is robust against local errors and how large a perturbation can be , until the model undergoes a phase transition",
    "?    this question has been extensively studied recently for the case of the conventional toric code in a uniform magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the overall phase diagram is very rich containing first- and second - order phase transitions , multicriticality @xcite , and self - duality @xcite depending on the field direction .",
    "if the transition is second order , it is typically in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ising universality class except on a special line in parameter space where a more complicated behavior is detected @xcite .",
    "similarly , the phase diagram of a generalized @xmath2 toric code in a field also displays various interesting aspects such as a 3d @xmath3 quantum phase transition for the simplest case of a single parallel field . @xcite .",
    "such questions have not been studied for the topological color code except a few studies that investigated the finite temperature properties of color code@xcite , where it was shown that the topological order is stable to some finite temperature depending on size of the system with high error correction threshold .",
    "it is therefore the main motivation of this work to investigate the phase transition of the topological color code in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "this is done for a single magnetic field in either the @xmath4- or @xmath5-direction on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "it is shown that the topological color code in a single parallel field is mapped exactly to the baxter - wu hamiltonian @xcite in a transverse field on the triangular lattice . to the best of our knowledge neither of the models are exactly solvable and the phase diagrams are unknown .",
    "so already the simplest case of a single parallel field is fundamentally different to the analogous problem for the toric code . in a single parallel field ,",
    "one finds for the latter case a mapping to the conventional transverse field ising model displaying a second - order quantum phase transition@xcite .    here",
    "we investigate the topological color code in a single parallel field by high - order series expansion techniques about the low- and high - field limit .",
    "additionally , an exact diagonalization as well as a classical approximation for the baxter - wu model in a transverse field were performed .",
    "our results clearly reveal that the topological phase breaks down to the polarized phase through a first - order phase transition .",
    "the behavior of the perturbed topological color code is therefore different to the perturbed toric code .",
    "our results suggest that the topological order of the topological color code is more robust .",

    "[ conclud ] is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "topological color code is a topologically - ordered quantum stabilizer error correcting code which is defined on a certain class of two - dimensional lattices called 2-colexes @xcite .",
    "local degrees of freedom are spins 1/2 which are placed on the vertices of an arbitrary 2d trivalent lattice which has 3-colorable faces and can be wrapped around a compact surface of arbitrary topology of genus @xmath6 .",
    "each vertex is connected to three links with different colors say ( red , blue , green ) and each link connects two faces ( plaquettes ) of the same color .",
    "this colorable structure is denoted by topological color code ( tcc ) \\{@xmath7 } where @xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to a set of vertices , edges and plaquettes respectively .",
    "an example of a 2-colex construction on a honeycomb lattice is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tcctotal ] .     is characterized by two closed strings of the other two colors .",
    "@xmath10 are the global strings of the model on a periodic structure such as a torus with @xmath11 .",
    "the elementary excitations are described by open strings like @xmath12 which create particles at their end points on the surface of a plaquette ( see @xmath13 ) which share the same color with the string . ]    the protected subspace @xmath14 of the model is determined by the definition of the stabilizer group @xmath15 which is generated by a set of plaquette operators . for each plaquette @xmath9",
    ", there are a pair of stabilizer operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 s are the ordinary pauli operators .",
    "each plaquette operator satisfies the square identity relation , @xmath19 , and they mutually commute with each other . the states in protected subspace @xmath20",
    "are left invariant under the action of the plaquette operators , i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "an erroneous state @xmath22 is then defined as a state with at least one eigenvalue @xmath23 which violates the stabilizing condition @xmath24 or @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "it is possible to construct a hamiltonian in terms of stabilizer operators with topologically degenerate ground states where all erroneous states correspond to excited states . considering a trivalent lattice @xmath26",
    ", the topological color code hamiltonian reads as : [ pure_tcc ] h_tcc =- j_p ( x_p + z_p ) , where in the following we set @xmath27 to be positive and we focus on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "strings are the generalization of plaquette operators which can be either open or closed and defined by the product of the pauli spins of that string . for a generic plaquette , such as a blue one ( @xmath28 ) in fig .",
    "[ tcctotal ] , two closed strings of different colors ( red and green ) which turn around it s boundaries , identify the plaquette . in a similar manner",
    ", the product of different neighboring plaquette operators may produce a collection of different boundary operators .",
    "since all closed strings share an even number of vertices , they commute with each other and with the plaquette operators .",
    "there is also another type of string operator which commutes with plaquette operators but is not the product of boundary operators .",
    "these operators which are known as the global loops ( fundamental cycles ) , depend on the topology of the manifold on which the system is defined and have the character of color .",
    "the number of these closed loops depends on the genus of the manifold .",
    "for example , a torus with @xmath11 , has two global loops which in contrast to the closed boundaries are non - contractible .    for every homology class of the torus",
    "there are two closed strings each of one color say green and blue which connect the plaquettes of the same color .",
    "one can define nontrivial closed strings as @xcite :    [ closed_strings ] s_^cx= _ vi_v^x ,  s_^cz= _ vi_v^z ,    where @xmath29 is the set of spins on the string , @xmath30 stands for the homology class of the torus and @xmath31 characterizes the color .",
    "following this notation , one can label the non - contractible loops of the torus as follows :    [ noncontractible_loops ]    x_1 _ 2^bx ,  x_2 _ 1^gx ,  x_3 _ 2^bx ,  x_4 _ 1^gx , + z_1 _ 1^gz ,  z_2 _ 2^bz ,  z_3 _ 1^gz ,  z_4 _ 2^bz .    for the topological color code",
    ", these loops are labeled as ( @xmath32 ) and ( @xmath33 ) and shown in fig .",
    "[ tcctotal ] . in the next subsection",
    ", we will show how these operators manifest a 16-dimensional subspace for the protected coding space @xmath14 .",
    "since the plaquette operators commute with each other and therefore with the full hamiltonian [ pure_tcc ] , they share a simultaneous eigenstate and the ground state of eq .",
    "[ pure_tcc ] is readily found by finding the eigenstates of the plaquette operators . by starting from a polarized state with all spins in the up direction @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the number of vertices on the lattice ) ,",
    "the ground state of the system which is stabilized by the plaquette operators is constructed .",
    "it is convenient to denote the un - normalized ground state in the following form : [ tcc_ground_state ]    possible closed string - nets , a typical feature of the ground states of systems with topological order @xcite .",
    "applying the global loops to the ground state @xmath36 yields a set of different states which satisfy the stabilizing condition .",
    "generically , the set of degenerate protected subspace of tcc is defined as : [ degenerate_gs ] c=\\{|ijkl : |ijkl = x_1^i x_2^j x_3^k x_4^l |_gs } where @xmath37 are defined in eq .",
    "[ noncontractible_loops ] and @xmath38 correspond to the global string @xmath39 appearing ( not appearing ) in the set .",
    "these topological global loops can take one ground state to another one , and any error of this type is not detectable .",
    "a generic state of the ground - state subspace is then a superposition of the different states of the coding space as follows : [ degenerate_gs2 ] | = _ i , j , k , l a_i , j , k , l      any state @xmath40 of the system which violates the stabilizing condition ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) , is an excited state .",
    "for example one can say a state @xmath40 for which @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , has an @xmath39-type ( @xmath45-type ) quasiparticle excitation .",
    "since all of the closed strings commute with each other , it is not possible to express the excited states of the system in terms of the closed strings .",
    "the elementary excitations of the tcc are described by open strings .",
    "colored strings are open if they have endpoints .",
    "these endpoints are localized at plaquettes which have the same color as the string , see also fig .",
    "[ tcctotal ] .",
    "in particular , a plaquette @xmath46 is an endpoint of string @xmath12 if the number of edges of @xmath12 meeting at @xmath46 is odd . in terms of string operators ,",
    "a plaquette @xmath9 is an endpoint of @xmath12 if @xmath47 or , equivalently , if @xmath48 .",
    "thus , open string operators do not commute with those plaquette operators at their ends . as a consequence ,",
    "the presence of open strings in the system would violate the stabilizing condition producing an elementary excitation : [ tcc_excitations ]     z_p |_ex= z_p x _",
    "|_gs = -x _ z_p |_gs= -|_ex .",
    "these elementary excitations are abelian anyons .",
    "there exist other families of nontrivial topological charges which emerge by combining the elementary excitations .",
    "each single excitation is a boson by itself , as well as the combination of two elementary excitations with the same color .",
    "furthermore , combination of the excitations of different color and type creates particles with semionic mutual statistics and two families of fermions @xcite .",
    "ground states are states where all eigenvalues of plaquette operators are @xmath49 for @xmath27 .",
    "the ground - state energy of the system on a lattice with @xmath50 plaquettes ( corresponding to @xmath51 sites ) is therefore @xmath52 .",
    "the energy of excited states depends only on the total number of @xmath23 eigenvalues of the plaquette operators such that each @xmath23 eigenvalue costs the energy @xmath53 , i.e.  the first excited state of the system is @xmath50-fold degenerate ( omitting the topological degeneracy ) and it has a total energy @xmath54 .",
    "consequently , the energy spectrum is equidistant and the elementary excitations corresponding to @xmath23 eigenvalues are static and non - interacting .",
    "our major objective is to study the robustness of the tcc in an external magnetic field .",
    "we therefore add to the topological color code @xmath55 a single parallel field in the @xmath4-direction .",
    "let us stress that it would be fully equivalent to consider the case of a magnetic field in the @xmath5-direction , because only the behavior of @xmath39-type and @xmath45-type particles are interchanged . to be specific , we study the following hamiltonian [ transverse_tcc ] h =- j_p ( x_p + z_p ) -h_x _",
    "v _ v^x , where the first sum runs over all hexagons and the second one over all sites of the honeycomb lattice . in the following we set @xmath56 .",
    "the plaquette operators read as [ plaq_op ]    x_p=_1^x_2^x_3^x_4^x_5^x_6^x + z_p=_1^z_2^z_3^z_4^z_5^z_6^z    where the numbers ( @xmath57 ) represent the six sites of the hexagon @xmath9 .",
    "acts on the site @xmath58 of the lattice , it can be considered as the end point of three different colored open strings say ( red , green , blue ) which create three @xmath45-type quasiparticle ( qp ) on the neighboring plaquettes sharing the same color with the strings .",
    "the yellow circle denotes the @xmath59 field which is connected to the end points of the red , blue and green strings and the three colored circles on the surface of the plaquettes are the qp excitations in the topological phase .",
    "the qps are created on the vertices of the effective triangular lattice.,width=151 ]    in the presence of the @xmath4 field , any trivial closed string @xmath60 pays an excitation energy @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of vertices of the string .",
    "the strings stay static and the field perturbation in the hamiltonian [ transverse_tcc ] can be considered as a tension term .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath63 plaquette operators deform the strings inducing them to fluctuate .",
    "hence one can think of them as the kinetic term @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned in the previous section , the excitations are created by open strings .",
    "every open strings create two excitations at their ends costing a total energy of @xmath64 . in the limit of @xmath65 ,",
    "open strings are not energetically favorable and tension is too weak to prevent the closed strings from fluctuating . so as a result , the ground state of the system is a superposition of strongly fluctuating closed string . in other limit ,",
    "@xmath66 , the strong tension suppresses all of the fluctuating strings and the ground state of the system lies in a spin polarized phase where spins point in field direction .",
    "henceforth , it is physically reasonable to think of a phase transition between the two phases at some critical value of @xmath67 .    in order to disclose this phase transition",
    ", one has to solve hamiltonian [ transverse_tcc ] and look at the spectrum of the model .",
    "unfortunately , the perturbed tcc is no longer exactly solvable .",
    "however , the @xmath68 plaquette operators commute with the magnetic field and therefore with the full hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ transverse_tcc ] . as a consequence , the eigenvalues @xmath69 of all @xmath68 plaquette operators",
    "are conserved quantities and the system is block - diagonal in these quantum numbers .",
    "the @xmath39-type excitations are therefore frozen with a constant energy gap @xmath53 .",
    "it is therefore very reasonable that the relevant low - energy physics takes place in the sub - block where no @xmath39-type particles are present , i.e. we focus on the sub - block where all eigenvalues of @xmath68 plaquette operators are @xmath49 .",
    "the hamiltonian in this sub - block is then given by [ transverse_tcc_le ] h =- jn_p - j_p z_p -h_x _ v _ v^x .",
    "hence , the magnetic field in the @xmath4-direction only affects @xmath45-type particles . as a consequence ,",
    "the mutual fractional statistics between @xmath39-type and @xmath45-type particles plays no role in this sub - block .",
    "this fact is the basis for the mapping of the perturbed tcc in this sub - block to the baxter - wu model in a transverse field as discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the elementary idea behind the mapping to the baxter - wu model in a transverse field is to swich from the original spin operators to an effective language where the eigenvalues @xmath69 of @xmath63 plaquette operators are the basic degrees of freedom .",
    "let us stress again that the @xmath68 operators commute with the magnetic field in the @xmath4-direction and the low - energy physics therefore takes place in the sub - block where all @xmath70 . as a consequence ,",
    "the energy of all states only depends on the eignevalues of the @xmath63 operators .",
    "this fact can be formally seen by choosing the @xmath34 in eq .",
    "[ tcc_ground_state ] as a fully - polarized state in the @xmath4-direction for which @xmath71 holds trivially .",
    "as mentionned above , the spectrum of the tcc is equidistant and it depends only on the eigenvalues of the @xmath63 plaquette operators in a very simple fashion .",
    "in fact , one can introduce a pseudo - spin 1/2 pauli matrix @xmath72 where the entries on the diagonal exactly correspond to the eigenvalues @xmath69 of the @xmath63 plaquette operators .",
    "the spectrum of the tcc is then given exactly by [ tcc_dual ] h^dual_tcc =- jn_p - j_i ^z_i , where @xmath73 refers to the center of the plaquettes @xmath9 .",
    "let us note that the centers of the plaquettes build an effective triangular lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ field - pertubation ] ) .",
    "we stress that this mapping keeps track of energetic properties .",
    "any information on degeneracies is clearly lost . indeed , the tcc is mapped to an effective magnetic field which has a unique polarized ground state in contrast to the topological order present for the tcc .",
    "next we reformulate the magnetic field term @xmath74 in terms of pseudo - spin variables .",
    "we therefore have to determine how the eigenvalues of @xmath63 plaquette operators are affected by the action of a @xmath75 on a certain site @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , the operator @xmath75 just flips the three eigenvalues of @xmath63 plaquette operators which are attached to the site @xmath58 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the anti - commutation relation between @xmath75 and @xmath63 if @xmath58 is part of the hexagon @xmath9 . in terms of pseudo - spin operators",
    "the flipping of three eigenvalues corresponds to @xmath76 where the sites 1,2 , and 3 build an elementary triangle on the effective triangular lattice .",
    "henceforth , the hamiltonian [ transverse_tcc_le ] is mapped to the so - called baxter - wu model in a transverse field : [ ising3body ] h =- jn_p - j_i _",
    "i^z- h_x _ ijk _ i^x_j^x_k^x , where the first sum runs over the sites of a triangular lattice and the second sum runs over all triangles with sites @xmath73 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "one should note that the number of sites on the effective triangular lattice is equal to the number of plaquettes @xmath50 on the original honeycomb lattice .",
    "the magnetic field is therefore mapped to an effective three - spin interaction .",
    "let us note that in the dual picture , the elementary excitations of the topological color code ( @xmath79 ) correspond to simple spin flips which are static and non - interacting hardcore bosons .",
    "our main goal of this paper is to understand and detect the topological phase transition between the topologically - ordered phase at low fields and the polarized phase present at large fields . as a first step to this end , we exactly diagonalized the hamiltonian ( [ ising3body ] ) for triangular lattices with @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 sites using the lanczos algorithm .",
    "the numerical diagonalization is performed for @xmath83 rectangular clusters where @xmath84 is the number of sites at each side of the rectangles and the periodic boundary conditions are imposed at the boundaries of the clusters .",
    "we diagonalized the baxter - wu hamiltonian in the @xmath5-pauli spin basis and used the bit representation for different configurations of the spin states in the @xmath85 hilbert space . in order to preserve the flow of the paper for the reader",
    ", we postpone any discussion on the results until sec .",
    "[ phase_transition ] where we use the exact diagonalization ( ed ) results as a crosscheck to the series expansion data to firmly support our findings from the perturbative continuous unitary transformation method .",
    "following our goal , we applied a classical approach on the baxter - wu model in a transverse field . indeed , this model is much better suited for a classical calculation than the tcc in a field .",
    "the reason is that the topological phase has no classical analog .",
    "this is different for hamiltonian [ ising3body ] .",
    "the tcc is mapped to an effective field term which has a polarized ground state being well described by a classical configuration where all pseudo - spins point in the @xmath5-direction . additionally , the ground state of the effective three - spin interactions originating from the magnetic field term have also a well - defined classical counterpart . indeed , there are exactly four classical ground states for @xmath86 which are uniquely defined by a three - site triangular unit cell : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 where the @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) corresponds to classical vectors poniting to the @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) direction .",
    "it is important to realize that the effect of the effective field term in the classical limit on the four classical ground states of the baxter - wu model is very simple .",
    "the field term simply rotates every classical spin vector in essentially the same fashion , from the @xmath4-axis in direction to the @xmath5-axis in the cartesian coordinate system . as a consequence ,",
    "it is sufficient to use a single - site unit cell to study the baxter - wu model in a transverse field in the classical limit .",
    "technically , we replace the vector of pseudo - spin pauli matrices @xmath95 by a classical vectors @xmath96 with unit length .",
    "consequently , the classical energy of the hamiltonian [ ising3body ] reads as :    [ classical_tcc_ising ] = -j(1 + ) -2h_x ( ) ^3 , where @xmath50 is the number of sites on the triangular lattice .",
    "note that only two angles @xmath97 and @xmath98 appear in this expression because a single - site unit cell has been used . in order to get the minimum of the classical energy , one finds readily @xmath99 .",
    "the remaining expression only depends on @xmath98 .",
    "the minimum is given either by @xmath100 or by @xmath101 depending explicitly on the ratio @xmath102 .",
    "the first solution @xmath103 corresponds to a fully polarized state in @xmath5-direction , i.e. it refers to the polarized phase in the dual language or the topological phase in the original language of the perturbed tcc .",
    "this solution is definitely favored in the low - field limit @xmath104 .",
    "in contrast , the second solution @xmath101 signals the presence of the symmetry - broken phase in the perturbed baxter - wu model or the polarized phase in the initial problem .",
    "it is certainly realized in the high - field limit @xmath105 .",
    "the phase transition between these two solutions happens at @xmath106 .",
    "the classical energy displays a kink and the transition is therefore first order .",
    "the first - order nature of the phase transition in the baxter - wu model in a transverse field in the classical limit is already a hint that the topological phase transition of the tcc in a magnetic field is different compared to the toric code in a field .",
    "the low - energy physics of the toric code in a single field corresponds to the transverse field ising model on the square lattice .",
    "the latter shows a second - order phase transition in the classical limit as well as for the full quantum problem . in the next section we therefore turn to the original problem of the tcc in a magnetic field and we show by high - order series expansion techniques and by exact diagonalizations that the quantum phase transition between the topological phase and the polarized phase is indeed a first - order phase transition as suggested by the classical approach",
    "the method of continuous unitary transformations ( cuts ) invented by wegner@xcite is one of the powerful techniques for diagonalizing or rather block - diagonalizing a hamiltonian . here",
    "we use the perturbative realization of the method ( pcuts ) ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) to study the tcc in an external magnetic field .",
    "the central idea of cuts is to choose a suitable generator for the unitary transformation and to ( block- ) diagonalize the initial hamiltonian by applying an infinite sequence of successive unitary operators of particular form .",
    "the transformation of the hamiltonian takes therefore place in a continuous fashion : [ flow_hamiltonian ] h()=u^()hu ( ) , where @xmath107 is the flow parameter such that @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the effective block - diagonal hamiltonian .    considering a hamiltonian of the form @xmath110 where @xmath111 is diagonal and",
    "@xmath112 is the perturbation , the pcut uses the quasiparticle generator @xcite and it maps the hamiltonian to an effective one which conserves the number of quasiparticles .",
    "the pcut is applicable to models where the unperturbed part of the hamiltonian , @xmath111 , has an equidistant spectrum .",
    "additionally , the perturbation must be written in the form @xmath113 where @xmath114 increments ( or decrements , if @xmath115 ) the number of quasiparticles ( excitations ) by @xmath116 .",
    "hence , the full hamiltonian reads : h = e_0+q+x_n =- n^n t_n where @xmath117 is the unperturbed ground state energy , @xmath4 is the perturbation parameter and q is the hermitian operator counting the number of quasiparticles .",
    "most importantly , the effective hamiltonian @xmath118 conserves the number of qp s : @xmath119}=0 $ ] . in the following we",
    "demonstrate how the low - field and the high - field limit can be tackled by pcuts .",
    "as previously outlined , we aim at a quasiparticle description for the low - energy physics of the low - field phase .",
    "consequently , one would have to set up a high - order series expansion inside the topologically - ordered phase in an analogous fashion as it has been done for the toric code in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "but this is not necessary in the present case because one can benefit from the mapping of the perturbed tcc to the baxter - wu model in a transverse field .",
    "indeed , the topological low - field phase corresponds to a conventional polarized phase in the dual picture . in the following",

    "the field term of hamiltonian [ transverse_tcc ] is the diagonal part , @xmath111 , and the topological color code @xmath55 represents the perturbation .",

    "regardless of how many particles already exist on the sites of a hexagon , the perturbation @xmath63 can therefore change the number of spin flips ( qp s ) by @xmath138 . however , one has to keep in mind that the @xmath68 stabilizing condition is not violated . in other words ,",

    "it is therefore interesting to understand how external perturbations such as a magnetic field affect this topological phase and what kind of topological phase transitions do occur . in this work we studied the robustness of the topological color code in a single parallel magnetic field on the honeycomb lattice . due to the fact that one sort of plaquette operators still commutes with the full hamiltonian , one type of elementary excitations is frozen and the relevant low - energy physics takes place in the sub - block where only one type of elementary excitations is present .",
    "we have shown that the perturbed color code in this sub - block is isospectral to the baxter - wu model in a transverse field on the triangular lattice . to the best of our knowledge",

    "our findings are further in full agreement with the exact diagonalization results of the baxter - wu model in a transverse field .",
    "the behavior of the tcc in a magnetic field is therefore different to the analogous problem of the perturbed toric code .",
    "the latter displays a second - order quantum phase transition at the critical point @xmath143 for the case of a single parallel field where the low - energy physics of this problem is given by the conventional ising model in a transverse field on the square lattice . our results therefore suggest that the topological color code is more robust than the toric code .",
