    "the two field model we shall study in @xmath0 dimensions is described by the lagrangian density @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are vector functions with a prescribed functional dependence on the dynamical fields @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a potential term .",
    "note that we can recover some usual lorentz symmetry breaking models from ( [ call ] ) by choosing appropriately the vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath10 and @xmath11 , one recovers the model introduced very recently by barreto and collaborators barreto .",
    "in fact , the first example we work out here is precisely this one , which we are going to show possesses an entire topological sector not considered in the work of reference @xcite .",
    "if the potential @xmath7 can be written in such a way that @xmath12 with @xmath13 being any function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the energy density of the bps states becomes @xmath14 with @xmath15 , where we have defined @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the prime stands for space derivative .    from equation ( [ energia ] ) , we can see that the solutions of minimal energy are obtained from the following two coupled first order equations @xmath18    finally the bps energy is written , as usual , by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 mean the @xmath22 vacuum states of the model . here , it is important to remark that the bps solutions settle into vacuum states asymptotically .",
    "in other words , the vacuum states act as implicit boundary conditions of the bps equations .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in the first order equations of motion ( eq1a ) and in the energy density ( [ energia ] ) only the space components of the functional vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , are present .    from now on , in order to solve the equations ( [ eq1a ] ) , let us consider models for which we can write @xmath27 as a function of @xmath28 , that is , @xmath29 .",
    "in this situation , instead of applying the usual trial - orbit approach @xcite-@xcite , we note that it is possible to write the following equation @xmath30    where the differential element @xmath31 is a kind of invariant . in these cases",
    "one is lead to    @xmath32    equation ( [ eqm ] ) is the generalization of the one studied in @xcite to the case of nonlinear lorentz and cpt breaking scenarios .",
    "it is , in general , a nonlinear differential equation relating the scalar fields of the model .",
    "if one is able to solve it completely for a given model , the function @xmath33 can be used to eliminate one of the fields , so rendering the equations ( [ eq1a ] ) uncoupled and equivalent to a single one . finally , this uncoupled first - order nonlinear equation can be solved in general , even if numerically .    we have found this method simpler than the method of the orbits broadly and successfully applied to study the mapping of the soliton solutions and defect structures in problems involving the interaction two scalar fields . despite of being simpler , the method applied here",
    "furnishes not only the same orbits than those obtained by using the method of the orbits appearing in the references @xcite-@xcite , but also some new ones as can be seen through a comparison with reference @xcite . in",
    "the example worked out below one can verify that , this time , the mapping constructed here furnishes the very same orbits obtained in the reference @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , we were able to find new solitonic configurations , not observed by barreto and collaborators .",
    "in this section we consider the particular model introduced in the work of barreto _ et al _ @xcite in order to apply the method discussed in the previous section .",
    "in fact , we show in this example that the equation ( eqm ) can be mapped into a linear differential equation , from which it is possible to obtain the general solutions for the soliton fields . in the case on the screen , the superpotential @xcite",
    "is written as @xmath34    and the lorentz symmetry breaking terms in the lagrangian density ( [ call ] ) are chosen to be given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , such that equation ( [ eqm ] ) is rewritten as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are constants .",
    "at this point one can verify that , performing the transformations @xmath40and @xmath41the equation ( [ phi / chi ] ) becomes @xmath42 which is a typical inhomogeneous linear differential equation @xcite .",
    "the general solutions for the orbit equation are then easily obtained , giving @xmath43@xmath44and @xmath45    where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are arbitrary integration constants .",
    "in general it is not possible to solve @xmath6 in terms of @xmath27 from the above solutions , but the contrary is always granted . here , with the aid of ( [ w1 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , we shall substitute the expressions of @xmath51 obtained from ( [ 12a ] ) , ( [ 12b ] ) and ( [ 12c ] ) in the second equation ( [ eq1a ] ) , obtaining respectively : @xmath52    @xmath53    barreto and collaborators @xcite have limited themselves to the orbits in which @xmath54 and @xmath55 and the arbitrary constant @xmath48 equals to zero or infinity . in the particular case with @xmath56 they have found a lump - like profile for the field @xmath57 and a kink - like profile for the field @xmath58 . by integrating the equation ( [ 13 ] ) and substituting its solutions into the equation ( 10 ) we get the following solutions for the field @xmath59    @xmath60{a}e^{\\mp 2\\sqrt{a}r(x - x_{0})}}{(\\sqrt{a}% e^{\\mp 2\\sqrt{a}r(x - x_{0})}+c)^{2}-4ab}-\\frac{b}{2r } ,   \\label{chia}\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is a constant of integration , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and we have taken @xmath65 . on its turn",
    "the solutions for the field @xmath58 are obtained by substituting the classical solutions of the equation ( [ 13 ] ) into the equation ( [ 12a ] ) , namely    @xmath66}{(\\sqrt{a}e^{\\mp 2\\sqrt{a}r(x - x_{0})}+c)^{2}-4ab}\\ . \\label{phia}\\ ] ]    the above solutions are valid if the parameters satisfy the conditions @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the behavior of the above solutions are plotted in the figure 1 for the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "one can observe that in both pairs of solutions , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the field @xmath59 exhibits a lump - like profile and the field @xmath58 a kink - like profile .",
    "this behavior is also found in many systems of two interacting solitons reported in the literature .    more recently @xcite it has been shown that many models of two interacting solitons , very similar to this one with explicit lorentz symmetry breaking that we are presenting here , can also exhibit kink - like behavior for both of the soliton fields , depending on the range of the parameters of the model .",
    "inspired on this achievement , we have shown that it is also possible to have kink - like profiles for both of the fields , for particular values of the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 , in the model treated here .",
    "in fact if one takes @xmath75 , which corresponds to one of the solutions with @xmath76 , and @xmath77 in the equations ( [ chia ] ) and ( [ phia ] ) we obtain the following forms for the fields    @xmath78    and    @xmath79    in the figure 2 we present the behavior of the above kink solutions for @xmath80 .",
    "one could interpret these solutions as representing two kinds of torsion in a chain , represented through an orthogonal set of coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath81 .",
    "so that , in the plane ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) , the type-@xmath82 kink corresponds to a complete torsion and the type-@xmath83 corresponds to a half torsion , similarly to what has been done in @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the pairs of type-@xmath83 solutions have a bps energy lower than that associated to the type-@xmath82 soliton solutions .",
    "this can be shown by substituting the asymptotic values of the solutions in the equation ( [ ebps ] ) , that is , for the type-@xmath82 solutions we find @xmath84 , and @xmath85 for the type-@xmath83 solutions .",
    "in what follows , we will study a more general model contemplating a number of particular cases which have been studied in the literature , including the previous and some other new ones .",
    "for this , we begin by defining the superpotential @xmath86 such that the equation ( [ eqm ] ) is given by    @xmath87    where @xmath88 .",
    "the space - component of the functionals terms responsible for breaking the lorentz symmetry explicitly , namely , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , are to be chosen more general than those of the model discussed previously and conveniently such that the integration of the equation ( [ phi / chi-2 ] ) be possible . based on the succesfull generalization of models of interacting solitons also carried out in the reference @xcite and in the development of the model of the previous section",
    ", a possible generalized model can be constructed by choosing    @xmath91    and the following forms for the functionals @xmath92 and @xmath93 ,    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is a positive integer number , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are constants and the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath74 can be thought as space - components of two - vectors pointing out in some preferred direction in space - time and the responsible for breaking the lorentz symmetry .",
    "the corresponding equation for the dependence of the field @xmath5 as a function of the field @xmath28 is now given by @xmath99 now , by performing the transformations    @xmath100    and    @xmath101    we get    @xmath102    the above equation is very similar to the equation ( [ 11 ] ) and can be easily integrated out .",
    "its general solution in the case @xmath103 and @xmath104 is    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is an arbitrary integration constant . the solutions for the equation ( [ 15 ] ) in the cases @xmath107 and @xmath108 can also be obtained , but we will not deal with them here .",
    "we substitute the equations ( [ trans1 ] ) , ( [ trans2 ] ) and ( [ map2 ] ) in one of the equations ( [ eq1a ] ) to obtain the following first - order equation of motion for the field @xmath109    @xmath110^{n/2}. \\label{asd1}\\ ] ]    this last equation can be solved analytically or numerically , depending on the values of the parameters . for the particular case with @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113",
    "we obtain very simple kink solutions for both of the fields @xmath58 and @xmath114 , as can be verified from the behavior of the solution for the field @xmath115",
    "@xmath116    where @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and by substituting ( [ varsigma ] ) in the equations ( [ trans2 ] ) , ( [ map2 ] ) and ( [ trans1 ] ) .",
    "the construction of an even more general model which includes non - linear dependence on the field @xmath114 can be carried out by following the generalization proposed in the reference @xcite .",
    "this can be accomplished by choosing the following form of the superpotential    @xmath119    where @xmath120 is given by the equation ( [ f(phi ) ] ) and @xmath121 is a positive integer . in order to include the terms responsible for breaking the lorentz symmetry and to obtain a solution for the differential equation ( eqm )",
    "it is reasonable to choose the functionals @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the following forms    @xmath122    with this generalization the equation ( [ eqm ] ) can be written in the form    @xmath123    where @xmath124 .",
    "the equation ( [ asd2 ] ) is similar to the one which appears in reference @xcite .",
    "it admits the solution    @xmath125\\times\\cr\\cr & \\ & \\bigg[{\\tilde c}_{1}+\\frac{2^{m/(m-2)}}{m(m-2)}\\frac{\\mu n-2am}{% 2\\lambda(\\mu - b)}\\chi^2 \\biggl(\\frac{\\chi^{(2-m)}}{(m-2)}\\biggr)% ^{2/(m-2)}\\times\\cr\\cr & \\ & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\gamma\\biggl(\\frac{2}{(m-2)},\\frac{1}{\\lambda(\\mu - b)}% \\frac{\\chi^{(2-m)}}{(m-2)}\\biggr)\\bigg]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath126 is an arbitrary integration constant and @xmath127 is the incomplete gamma function .",
    "we have been able to generalize a model presented recently in the reference @xcite which incorporates the phenomena of solitons interactions and the lorentz symmetry breaking .",
    "the generalization has been carried out in two ways .",
    "we have found non - trivial classical solutions which exhibit kink - like behavior for both of the interacting fields and , consequently , with bps energy lower than that associated with the usual solutions presented previously for the same model .",
    "another interesting aspect of the kink - like solutions rest on the study of the stability of the solutions against small time - dependent linear perturbation .",
    "at least for some models with only one scalar field , it has been shown in the reference @xcite that models with kink - like solutions possess the stability of these solutions , on the other hand , models with lump - like classical solutions are unstable . for two interacting scalar fields the problem is cumbersome ,  even though the authors of the reference @xcite have been able to show , based on very elegant and general arguments , that the  solutions found there , even with lump - like configurations for one of the fields , are stable .",
    "we understand that the analysis of the stability carried out in reference @xcite is valid for reference systems in which @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the time - component of the two - vector responsible for the lorentz symmetry breaking . for reference systems in which @xmath130",
    "the analysis has not been done .",
    "we have also proposed generalizations of the model of the reference barreto by introducing non - linear terms that break the lorentz symmetry .",
    "this last generalization was possible thanks to the successful generalization carried out in the reference @xcite which deals with a lorentz symmetric two - dimensional model of interacting scalar fields .",
    "* acknowledgements : * the authors asd and mh thanks to cnpq and fab to fapesp for the financial support .",
    "we also thanks to professor d. bazeia for introducting us to this matter and to the reference @xcite .",
