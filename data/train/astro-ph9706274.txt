    "water is believed to be one of the most abundant molecules in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "it can be formed through gas  phase chemistry in cold , dense and thick clouds , with an abundance ratio h@xmath0o / h@xmath0 between 10@xmath6 and 10@xmath7 , depending on the chemical models , the reactions rates used , the c / o abundance in the gas phase ( leung , herbst & huebner 1984 ; langer & graedel 1989 ) ; in non  dissociative shocks the abundance ratio is calculated to be as high as 10@xmath8 ( draine , roberge & dalgarno 1983 ; kaufman & neufeld 1996 ) . the h@xmath0o abundance can also be enhanced through evaporation of grain mantles in star ",
    "forming hot cores ( jacq et al .",
    "1988 ; brown , charnley & millar 1988 ; gensheimer , mauersberger & wilson 1996 ) , so h@xmath0o could play a major role in the cooling of molecular clouds , and in the oxygen budget of the ism . unfortunately , the broad atmospheric water lines prevent a direct detection from the ground in our own galaxy ; up to now , no thermal emission from the main isotopomer in its fundamental lines has been detected , and the h@xmath0o abundance in the ism remains poorly known .",
    "attempts have been made to determine the h@xmath0o abundance through observations of the isotopomers hdo and h@xmath9o ( henkel et al .",
    "1987 ; jacq et al .",
    "1988 , 1990 ; wannier et al . 1991",
    "; gensheimer et al .",
    "1996 ) , and through observations of the precursor ion h@xmath10o@xmath2 ( phillips , van dishoeck & keene 1992 ) .",
    "abundances of the normal isotopomer of h@xmath0o around 10@xmath7 have been deduced .",
    "this is also confirmed by the detection in orion of absorption lines at 2.66 microns with the kuiper airborne observatory ( kao ) ( knacke & larson 1991 ) . the latter authors found an ortho  para ratio of 1 , which confirms that water had no time , after sublimation from grains , to reach the equilibrium high temperature ratio of 3 .",
    "also the deuterated substitute hdo reveals a high degree of fractionation ( hdo / h@xmath0o @xmath1 100 d / h ) , which implies h@xmath0o formation at low temperatures .",
    "since some of the h@xmath0o submillimeter and fir transitions are population inverted , causing maser emission with a very high flux , they can be detected from the ground even at 183ghz ( cernicharo et al .",
    "1994 ) . another method to avoid atmospheric absorption lines is to observe a remote object , for which the lines are redshifted outside the broad atmospheric counterpart .",
    "only one tentative detection has been reported so far : the 752ghz para ",
    "water line in the @xmath11 galaxy iras 10214 + 47 ( encrenaz et al . 1993 ; casoli et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the emission in this remote starburst galaxy is apparently significantly enhanced by gravitational lensing .",
    "very recently , observations with the iso satellite of the @xmath12  @xmath13 179.5 @xmath14 m line of ortho  water in absorption against the continuum of the galactic center ( sgrb2 , cernicharo et al .",
    "1997 ) have revealed that the h@xmath0o molecule is abundant over very extended regions .",
    "it has also been detected in absorption in front of massive young stars with strong ir continuum , around 6@xmath14 m within the bending vibration series ( helmich et al .",
    "1996 ; van dishoeck & helmich 1996 ) .",
    "abundances of a few 10@xmath7 are deduced , with a tendency of scaling with the amount of warm gas .",
    "even higher abundances ( @xmath15 ) have been derived from h@xmath0o emission from the stellar wind of w hya with iso  sws and lws , but the exact figures depend on the outflow modelisation ( barlow et al .",
    "1996 ; neufeld et al .",
    "1996 ) .    here",
    "we report the first detection in absorption at high redshift of an h@xmath0o line .",
    "the high redshift allows us to avoid the high opacity of the terrestrial atmosphere near the rest frequency , and because absorption is against a small continuum source , excellent spatial resolution is achieved , equal to the angular size of the b0218 + 357 quasar core , which is only of the order of 1 milli - arcsec ( patnaik , porcas & browne 1995 ) . at the distance of the absorber ( @xmath16 , giving an angular distance of 1089 mpc , for @xmath17=75 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 and @xmath19 = 0.5 ) , this corresponds to only 5pc .",
    "the observations were made with the iram 30 m telescope at pico veleta near granada in spain in march 1997 .",
    "table 1 displays the observational parameters .",
    "several sis receivers were used simultaneously : at 3 mm , the receiver was tuned to the h@xmath0o 3@xmath20 - 2@xmath21 para line at 183ghz , redhifted to 108.811ghz to obtain an estimate of the excitation temperature ( the lower level of this transition corresponds to a temperature of 190k ) .",
    "the single  sideband ( ssb ) system temperature was 180k and the rejection level of the image sideband @xmath2230db . at 0.8 mm , the h@xmath0o 1@xmath23 - 1@xmath24 ortho line at 557ghz ,",
    "redshifted to 330.592 ghz , was observed .",
    "the receiver was operating in single ",
    "sideband , with a rejection level of a factor 4 ( 6db measured on orion ) ; its ssb receiver temperature was 90k and the system temperature was between 400 and 2000k , depending on the atmospheric humidity , with an average of 700k .",
    "two 512@xmath251mhz filterbanks and an autocorelator backend were used . here only the 1mhz resolution spectra are presented , binned to a velocity resolution of a few km / s .",
    "the observations were done with a nutating subreflector , with a beam  throw of 1 in azimuth and a switching frequency of 0.5hz .",
    "the temperature scale was calibrated every 10 minutes by a chopper wheel on an ambient temperature load , and on liquid nitrogen .",
    "pointing was checked on broadband continuum sources .",
    "the relative pointing offsets between the 2 receivers were of the order of 4 \" .",
    "the frequency tunings and rejection levels were checked by observing known molecular lines towards orion , dr21 and irc+10216 .",
    "the integration time was 8 and 20 hours on the 183ghz and 557ghz lines respectively , and a noise  level of 1.1 and 1.3mk in the t@xmath26 antenna temperature scale was obtained , with a velocity resolution of 9 km s@xmath18 .",
    "the forward and beam efficiencies at each frequency are displayed in table 1 .    in order to derive the continuum flux , b0218 + 357",
    "was observed regularly with a continuum backend and in a fast switching mode ( 4 times higher than in the line observing mode ) . the continuum level from line observations obtained under good sky conditions",
    "was also used .",
    "the two estimates of the continuum flux agree .",
    "the bl lac object b0218 + 357 was selected for this first search for h@xmath0o in absorption because it is the absorbing system at high redshift with the highest column density ( wiklind & combes 1995 ) .",
    "the remote quasar ( z@xmath270.9 , e.g. browne et al . 1993 ) is gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy at z@xmath10.68466 , which produces the absorption .",
    "the radio image of the quasar is composed of two distinct flat ",
    "spectrum cores ( a and b ) , with a small einstein ring surrounding the b image , of 335 milli  arcsecond ( mas ) in diameter ( patnaik , browne & king 1993 ) .",
    "since the ring has a steep spectrum , it is best interpreted as the image of a jet component , or a hot spot or knot in a jet that happens to lie in the line of sight to the center of the lens .",
    "owing to its steep spectral index , the einstein ring gives a negligible contribution to the continuum flux at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "the intensity ratio between the two images is a / b @xmath28 34 at several radio wavelengths , but the b  component has varied in flux by @xmath28 10% in a few months ( odea et al . 1992 ; patnaik et al .",
    "since the depth of the molecular absorption is less than the continuum level , but the absorption is optically thick , it follows that the absorbing material does not cover the whole surface of the continuum source .",
    "it is likely that only one image of the quasar is covered by molecular clouds , since the two images a and b are separated by 1.8kpc at the absorber distance .",
    "the fraction of the total continuum which is absorbed is @xmath28 33% .",
    "figure [ h2o_f1 ] presents our h@xmath0o detected spectrum , compared to those of hco@xmath2(21 ) and co(21 ) previously detected with the iram 30 m telescope ( wiklind & combes 1995 ; combes & wiklind 1995 ) .",
    "the linewidths are very similar , respectively 15 , 16 and 15km / s for h@xmath0o , hco@xmath2(21 ) and co(21 ) , determined by gaussian fits .",
    "this is a strong indication that the h@xmath0o line is optically thick , as the @xmath4co and c@xmath5o isotopic lines have been detected , with progressively reduced line  widths ( combes & wiklind 1995 ) . the 3@xmath20 - 2@xmath21 para line at 183ghz was not detected .",
    "the 3@xmath29 upper limit presented in table1 were derived by assuming the same linewidths for the two h@xmath0o lines .",
    "the redshift of the absorbing molecular gas , z@xmath30 ( wiklind & combes 1995 ) , puts the redshifted h@xmath0o(1@xmath31 ) line at 330.593ghz , which is close to the frequency of the @xmath4co(32 ) transition at z@xmath10 of 330.588ghz ( e.g. lovas 1992 ) .",
    "the difference in velocity is only 4.1km / s .",
    "nevertheless , it is highly unlikely that the absorption line seen at 330.59ghz is caused by a galactic @xmath4co(32 ) transition .",
    "first of all , the depth of the absorption as well as the width of the h@xmath0o line is the same as those of the lines of redshifted co(21 ) , @xmath4co(21 ) , c@xmath5o(21 ) , hco@xmath2(21 ) , hcn(21 ) , etc .",
    "( combes & wiklind 1996 )  in itself a strong indication that our new line is from redshifted water .",
    "secondly , a search through all our spectra , covering several ghz , does not reveal any molecular transition at z@xmath10 , although several relatively strong lines should be present ( for instance : so(@xmath32 ) , sio(32 ) @xmath33 ) .",
    "thirdly , b0218 + 357 is situated at galactic coordinates @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "this means that unless galactic absorption occurs very locally , galactic rotation would displace the z@xmath10 line of @xmath4co(32 ) to negative velocities .",
    "if there is local gas , it is likely to be extended on scales of 1 ( the throw of our telescope beam ) and the observing procedure with a nutating subreflector would effectively cancel galactic absorption .",
    "figure [ h2o_f2 ] displays our continuum measurements , together with a compilation of previous results in the literature for lower frequencies . within the 1@xmath29 error bars ,",
    "the continuum spectrum can be fitted with a power law of slope @xmath36 . from our previous detection of the c@xmath5o(21 )",
    "line with an optical depth of @xmath28 3 ( combes & wiklind 1995 ) , we deduced an optical depth of 1500 for the @xmath37co(21 ) line .",
    "since the h@xmath0o abundance is likely to be only 10 times lower than that of co , while its dipole moment @xmath14 = 1.8 debye is 18 times higher , we expect an h@xmath0o optical depth about 30 times higher than co for cold gas , since @xmath38 scales as @xmath39 .",
    "this clearly prevents any estimation of the h@xmath0o abundance ; however the line strength s is about ten times lower for the 183 ghz line , so the upper limit on the 183 ghz line provides a constraint on the excitation temperature .",
    "the total column density of the h@xmath0o molecule , observed in absorption between the levels @xmath40 with an optical depth @xmath41 at the center of the observed line of width @xmath42 at half ",
    "power is : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant ( 8@xmath45/c@xmath46 ) , @xmath47 is the frequency of the transition , @xmath48 the statistical weight of the upper level (= 2 j@xmath49 + 1 ) , @xmath50 the einstein coefficient of the transition , @xmath51 the excitation temperature , and @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the partition function .",
    "the factor @xmath54 is the nuclear spin statistical weight , equal to for ortho states and for para states .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we adopt the hypothesis of restricted thermodynamical equilibrium conditions , i.e. that the excitation temperature is the same for all the h@xmath0o lines .",
    "also , we assume an ortho / para ratio of 3 . replacing in the above formula the molecular parameters from de lucia , helminger & kirchoff ( 1974 ) , and assuming the abundance of h@xmath0o / co @xmath28 0.1 , or h@xmath0o / h@xmath55 10@xmath7 , which is found for the galactic ism",
    ", the optical depths of the two h@xmath0o observed lines can be predicted as displayed in figure [ h2o_f3 ] .",
    "the 3@xmath29 upper limit to the 183 ghz line constraints then @xmath51 to be lower than 20 k.    this result implies that the bulk of the h@xmath0o molecules that we detect in absorption are not coming from hot dense cores , but are more widely spread and mixed with the molecular cloud absorbing in co. this is consistent with the high covering factor observed , and with the fact that the absorption technique selects preferentially cold gas ( e.g. combes & wiklind 1996 ; wiklind & combes 1997 ) . also , the absorbing gas is situated in an intervening cloud which happens to be on the line of sight of the remote quasar .",
    "it is thus not necessarily an actively star forming region , as is the case for emission line observations of distant galaxies .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that this result is based on the assumption of h@xmath0o galactic abundance , which is poorly known ; another solution could be a lower h@xmath0o abundance , which will release the constraint of low temperature .",
    "however , even with an abundance of h@xmath0o / h@xmath0 = 10@xmath56 ( or h@xmath0o / co=0.01 ) , the excitation temperature should be lower than 30k ( see fig [ h2o_f3 ] ) .",
    "a higher h@xmath0o abundance is not likely , unless we release the hypothesis of a constant @xmath51 over the rotational ladder .",
    "the present h@xmath0o line detection at 331ghz could not have been done without the enthusiastic support from the iram staff at the pico veleta .",
