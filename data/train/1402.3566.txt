    "the year 1995 was the culmination of several years of the search for fullerene materials.@xcite it also marks the beginning of a whole new area of investigation into the optical and thermal properties of fullerene aggregates . from both an experimental and theoretical perspective , this branch of condensed matter physics is receiving international attention .",
    "consequently , the theory for the properties of interacting fullerenes is a subject of considerable interest.@xcite    following the recent advances in production techniques such as solvent - assisted self - assembly,@xcite fullerenes can now be produced in specific quantities even to form thin films of fullerene - like mos nanoparticles@xcite and those achievements have stimulated renewed interest in these materials .",
    "additionally , the ability to control optical fields has now made it feasible to ascertain the plasmon excitations in pre - arranged arrays of fullerenes.@xcite the present paper has been stimulated by these exciting new developments , even though it employs a relatively simple model which is reasonable when the separation between the energy bands is large.@xcite additionally , our results may serve as a guide for explaining experimental studies.@xcite specifically , we are interested in calculating the plasma excitations of coulomb coupled spherical two - dimensional electron gases ( s2degs).@xcite here , we model three coupled spherical shells as shown in fig.[fig:1 ] . in our discussion below , we refer to the s2deg at the origin as  @xmath3\" , and the one centered on the @xmath4 and @xmath5-axis as `` @xmath6 '' and `` @xmath7 '' , respectively .",
    "this notation then allows us to label the coulomb matrix elements between spherical shells `` @xmath8 '' and `` @xmath9 '' with subscript `` @xmath10 '' , where @xmath11 .",
    "electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) has been used to probe the plasmon excitations for concentric - shell fullerenes embedded in a film.@xcite furthermore , perfectly spherical shells were used in the theoretical modeling of the eels data and the agreement was good .",
    "the model of lucas , et al.@xcite was shown to be qualitatively adequate for understanding the optical data for multi - shell fullerenes . in that work,@xcite the ultraviolet dielectric tensor of monolayer graphene is adapted to the spherical geometry of a fullerene by averaging over the three possible orientations of the @xmath12 axis .",
    "thus , a continuum model was used by lucas , et al.@xcite starting from the planar local di electric function of planar monolayer graphene .",
    "each s2deg may be polarized by external electromagnetic fields . however , the s2deg is only polarized for finite angular momentum quantum number @xmath13 . although @xmath0 is a good quantum number for labeling the plasma excitations on an isolated shell , it is not the case for displaced , coupled s2degs .",
    "in contrast to the well - understood situation of determining the plasma excitations in fullerenes,@xcite we seek its properties when the rotational symmetry is broken . here , for simplicity",
    ", @xmath14 corresponds to a non - circularly - polarized probe field , while @xmath15 is associated with a circularly - polarized probe field .",
    "moreover , the higher angular momentum with @xmath16 may be achieved by a special light beam , e.g. , a helical light beam .",
    "however , when two s2degs have their centers well separated so that there is no overlap of their charge distributions , the breaking of the spherical symmetry leads to significant differences with the multi - shell buckyball .",
    "similar calculations of the polarization functions proved the existence of strongly localized image states near the surface of a buckyball @xcite .",
    "anisotropy of the plasmon interaction could be seen for two interacting shells @xcite    the topology of multiple shells forming an aggregate determines the properties of coulomb interaction and consequently the details of the collective plasma excitations . for a single s2deg",
    ", the coulomb interaction depends on the angular momentum quantum number @xmath0 which in itself together with the radius of the shell serves to define the frequency of the plasmon mode .",
    "in contrast , when a pair of s2degs are coupled for a configuration such as the one exhibited in fig.[fig:1 ] , the polarization functions for all values of @xmath0 on each sphere may not be dissociated from one another .",
    "the inter - sphere coulomb matrix element depends on both @xmath0 and its projection @xmath1 on the axis of quantization .",
    "therefore , in principle , the plasmon mode equation is given in terms of a determinant of infinite order .",
    "but , for three interacting s2degs , the associated matrix may be broken down into diagonal sub - matrices corresponding to @xmath17 and consisting of @xmath18 elements whose coulomb interactions depend on @xmath0 and @xmath19 values of @xmath1 for each of the three shells .",
    "in contrast , the off - diagonal sub - matrices depend on coulomb matrix elements which are functions of pairs of different angular momenta , @xmath0 and @xmath20 , arising from each sphere .",
    "these off - diagonal coulomb terms are generally smaller than their diagonal counterparts and so may be formally treated as perturbations .",
    "consequently , in the lowest - order approximation , the @xmath15 mode is split by coulomb interactions depending on @xmath21 from each sphere , leading to the occurrence of nine plasmon branches .",
    "however , some of these may be very close to each other depending on the strength of the coulomb interaction .",
    "for example , when two s2degs are aligned along the @xmath4-direction , the number of well - separated plasmon branches is three and for the @xmath5-alignment we found only two non - equivalent plasmon branches .    in sec.[sec2 ]",
    ", we will first formulate the method for calculating the plasmon equations on three coupled s2degs .",
    "this is based on the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) in evaluating the induced density fluctuations for a weak external perturbation .",

    "we assume that the inequalities @xmath28 and @xmath29 are satisfied . in the absence of tunneling between the shells ,",

    "in fig.[fig:3 ] , we compare the strengths of the electrostatic interaction between pairs of s2degs when @xmath50 and @xmath15 with @xmath51 , where all the non - zero coulomb matrix elements for an interacting triad of spheres displayed schematically in fig.[fig:1 ] are presented . the matrix elements @xmath52 with @xmath14 and @xmath53 , which do not contribute to plasmon excitation , are also provided for comparison .",
    "these matrix elements greatly exceed all the others because of rotational symmetry .",

    "the reason for this difference is not due to the larger separation between @xmath57 which is @xmath60 times that between @xmath58 or @xmath59 but it is a consequence of the angular dependence inherent in the matrix elements . as a matter of fact , unlike the @xmath58 and @xmath59 matrix elements , we are unable to obtain semi - analytic expressions for the @xmath57 coulomb matrix elements since even the angular part of the related coulomb integral can not be expressed in analytical form . using numerical methods ,",
    "however , we have estimated these matrix elements to be on the order of @xmath61 times smaller than all the rest .",
    "this results in the existence of one strong nearly - degenerate plasmon mode , which is practically independent of separation @xmath55 between the centers of the spheres . additionally , due to the reduced symmetry , there are more non - zero matrix elements for @xmath57 coupling compared to the @xmath58 and @xmath59 cases , which however does not improve the impact of @xmath57 interaction because of their relatively small magnitude .    setting @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the set of linear equations",

    "panels ( a3 ) and ( b3 ) present all the plasmon branches of an interacting s2degs over a wider range of separation and frequencies .",

    "numerical results for the plasmon and particle - hole frequencies are presented in fig.[fig:4 ] , where we only chose @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "generally , the number of plasmon branches is determined by the dimensionality of the truncated matrix , with @xmath74 solutions associated with each sphere .",
    "we separate the case of two spheres with @xmath71alignment @xmath59 , for which the interaction sub - matrix is diagonal with two unequal non - zero elements , and the whole matrix allows exact diagonalization .",

    "we expect _ nine _ separate plasmon branches , corresponding to the solutions of @xmath75(r,\\omega)]=0 $ ] .",
    "however , _ three _ of them , corresponding to the @xmath57 interaction , are nearly - degenerate , due to its low relative strength of the coulomb coupling .",

    "plots @xmath76 and @xmath77 in fig.[fig:4 ] present both plasmons and particle - hole modes , as the peaks of @xmath78 $ ] and @xmath79 $ ] correspondingly .",
    "we calculated those quantities over a wider range of frequencies for different values of radius @xmath56 and separation @xmath55 .",
    "we conclude that the plasmons and single - particle excitation regions are well - separated so that the plasmons are not _ landau damped _ for all cases of an interacting bundle .",
    "but , the electron - hole mode region and plasmons get closer with increasing radius of the shell .",
    "our results for plasmon excitations for three interacting s2degs with unequal radii are presented in fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    "we chose the radius of the sphere at the origin ( sphere @xmath3 ) to be larger than that of either sphere @xmath6 or @xmath7 whose radius is still chosen to be equal to one another .",
    "i.e. , @xmath80 .",
    "we note that in this case the ratio of the coulomb interaction between spheres @xmath57 to that between either @xmath58 or @xmath59 is even smaller , compared to the same ratio of three s2degs with the same radius @xmath81 since the distance between shells @xmath58 and @xmath59 is increased .    when the separation @xmath55 between spheres @xmath58 or @xmath59 becomes large compared to @xmath23 , the plasmon frequencies when plotted as a function of @xmath55 form two horizontal branches , with each one arising from the plasmons on each isolated sphere with radii @xmath23 and @xmath25 .",
    "the higher frequency branch is due to the two spheres with smaller radius @xmath82 . as a consequence ,",
    "this plasmon branch exhibits a stronger resonance peak with a higher degree of degeneracy .",
    "the three solutions , corresponding to the @xmath57 interaction , stay nearly degenerate for all values of the separation @xmath55 .",
    "this behavior is similar to the previous case when @xmath73 .",
    "the resulting plasmon branches split apart , creating three asymmetric pairs of solutions .",
    "this is a general feature .     and two others with @xmath83 .",

    "we conclude that we have clearly demonstrated the anisotropy of the plasmon mode excitations for a particulate .",
    "the sum - rule presented by apell , echenique , and ritchie @xcite for surface plasmon frequencies does not apply here .",
    "although the surfaces in our model exhibit spatially localized collective modes , the plasmons for an isolated s2deg may be labeled by a single quantum number @xmath0 but , when the s2degs are coupled , all angular momentum quantum numbers and their projections onto the axis of quantization determine the plasmon frequencies . however , we emphasize that these plasma frequencies for the @xmath58 and @xmath59 configurations are functionals of the plasmon frequency @xmath87 of a single s2deg , and consequently must be related to each other .",

    "the coulomb potential matrix elements contain a larger number of non - zero teems and , more importantly , this submatrix is not diagonal .",
    "consequently , the plasmon equation may not be presented in such a simple functional form .",

    "the energy band structure is a suitable approximation for fullerenes when the energy bands are far apart .",
    "however , realistic energy band structure may be incorporated into the polarization function through a form factor involving the wave functions of the electrons as well as the coulomb matrix elements .",
    "we note that spectral correlations have been observed experimentally for metallic nanoparticles @xcite in that work , the plasmons for pairs were studied using polarization - selective total internal reflection .",
    "their measurements show that the frequencies for the coupled plasmon modes depend on whether the incident light wave vector perpendicular and parallel to the dimer axis .",
    "related work on dimer plasmons has been conducted by nordlander , et al .",
    "( ref . [ ] ) with the conclusion that the hybridized plasmon energy arising from individual metallic nanoparticles is determined by the orientation of the inter - particle axis with respect to the axis of polarization of the two constituents modeled as incompressible spherical liquids .",

    "[ ] the conclusions about the existence of anisotropy in the plasmon excitation energies in these systems are in agreement .",
    "similar effects are also expected to be observed in the case of nano - eggs : non - concentric multishells of nanoparticles .",
    "the hybridization of the plasmons has been proven to be an adequate and precise method to describe the plasmonic structure @xcite .",
    "the field enhancement , corresponding to the resonant excitation of plasmons , was reported to be much larger in the case of concentric nanoparticles , which support indirectly the concept of plasmon spatial correlation .",
    "since the plasmon dependence on the relative orientation and the separation between the interacting spheres was the principal property under investigation , we considered an aggregate of three which includes coupling along , perpendicular and making an angle with the axis of quantization for angular momentum .",
    "we clearly established the orientational dependence of the coupled plasmon excitation frequencies arising from the sensitive nature of the coulomb matrix elements .",
    "our formalism allows for any number and location of the s2degs , thereby leading to possible studies of aggregates of different size and shape .",
    "once the angular momentum quantum number @xmath0 is specified , the number of plasmon branches is determined by all the different non - zero potential matrix elements . the number of those elements is a consequence of symmetry properties .",
    "specifically , when a pair of spheres ( @xmath59 ) are aligned along the axis of quantization , there are only two such non - zero matrix elements , whereas three of them exist for @xmath58 interaction between the spheres , aligned along the @xmath96axis .",
    "there are five non - zero coulomb matrix elements between spheres whose centers lie on a line making an angle of forty - five degrees with the axis of quantization , but much smaller in magnitude . additionally , the effect of the coulomb interaction on the plasmons of a smaller sphere , occurring at a higher frequency , is just a small perturbation for @xmath57 coupling .",
