    "solar models generated with the @xcite or @xcite abundances agree quite nicely with helioseismic inferences of the sound speed , the location of the base of the convection zone , and the helium abundance in the convection zone .",
    "however , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite revised the solar abundances using three - dimensional hydrodynamic models of the atmosphere with improved input physics and non - local thermodynamic equilibrium effects , lowering abundances by up to 1/3 .",
    "solar models that use the new lower abundances yield worse agreement than those that use the older abundances .",
    "this has led to years of heated debates over whether the disagreement represents a solar model problem or a solar abundance problem .",
    "the ongoing disagreement has inspired a re - examination of all aspects of solar models , including opacities , diffusive settling , convective overshooting , and the possible accretion of low-_z _ material late in the sun s evolution or mass loss early in the sun s evolution ( see * ? ? ?",

    "although these proposed adjustments have led to some improvement in the agreement , they do not satisfactorily resolve the issue .",
    "further investigations into the basic physics of the solar interior are required .",
    "nuclear reactions generate the energy that drives our sun . developing an accurate picture of the conditions that lead to nuclear reactions is essential in order to fully understand the inner workings of the sun . with that in mind , we re - examine screening effects in the solar core . in this work ,",
    "we focus on _ p__p _ reactions which produce most of the nuclear energy generated in the sun .      in this section ,",
    "we derive an expression for calculating nuclear reaction rates following the treatment of @xcite .",
    "the reaction rate per unit volume between particles of types @xmath0 and @xmath1 is a product of the number densities of the particles , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the average value of the product of the relative velocity @xmath4 times the cross section @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the relative velocity distribution and @xmath8 accounts for reactions of like particles . because we will be dealing with the correction due to dynamic screening ( a ratio between the unscreened and screened reaction rates )",
    ", we can ignore the density factor and focus on the reaction rate per pair of particles , @xmath9 where @xmath10 @xmath11 is the reduced mass of the pair , and the maxwell  boltzmann distribution is used for @xmath7 .",
    "the cross section @xmath12 can be defined as a product of three separate energy - dependent factors @xmath13 where @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the charges of the interacting ions and @xmath17 is the reduced atomic weight .",
    "the exponential factor in this expression comes from the barrier penetration probability , the inverse energy dependence comes from the quantum  mechanical interaction between the two particles , and @xmath18 contains the intrinsically nuclear parts of the probability for a nuclear reaction to occur . with this substitution for @xmath12 , equation [ eq : lambda1 ]",
    "can be re - written as @xmath19 in the non - resonant reaction case , @xmath18 is slowly varying with @xmath20 , so we can treat it as a constant @xmath21 evaluated at the energy where @xmath22 is maximum .",
    "then the reaction rate per pair of particles ( without screening ) can be computed as @xmath23      @xcite developed a treatment to include the effect of static electron screening on nuclear reaction rates . here",
    "we summarize his method which we will use in section [ sect : method ] as the inspiration for our calculation of the dynamic screening correction .",
    "we begin by writing the total interaction energy as a combination of the bare coulomb potential and a contribution from the plasma : @xmath24 then consider a case in which the classical impact parameter @xmath25 is very small compared with the charge cloud radius @xmath26 and the nuclear radius @xmath27 is much smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "then the barrier penetration factor for @xmath28 depends only on the expression @xmath29 for distances larger than @xmath25 , the barrier penetration factor hardly depends on the potential .",
    "@xmath30 must be small for distances greater than @xmath26 and approach a constant value @xmath31 of the order of magnitude of @xmath32 for small @xmath33 .",
    "then , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the relative kinetic energy for which the integrand in equation [ eq : lambda1 ] reaches a sharp maximum .",
    "if this inequality is satisfied , @xmath30 can be replaced by the potential at the origin @xmath31 . by examining expression [ eq : edep ] , we can see that the screening potential has effectively increased the kinetic energy by a magnitude of @xmath31 , so the cross section factors for @xmath36 are equivalent to the unscreened factors with energy @xmath37 .",
    "equation [ eq : lambda1 ] can then be replaced by @xmath38 with the change of variables @xmath39 and the approximation @xmath40 , the reaction rate per pair of particles becomes @xmath41 because the penetration factor for @xmath42 is so small , the lower limit of the integral can be set to zero without significantly changing the value of the integral .",
    "we then see that @xmath43 illustrating that the reaction rate for the statically screened potential can be approximated by multiplying the rate for the bare coulomb potential by @xmath44 .",
    "salpeter then derives @xmath31 by solving the poisson - boltzmann equation for electrons and ions in a plasma under the condition of weak screening ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "he arrives at an expression for the screening energy that is equivalent to that of the debye ",
    "hckel theory of dilute solutions of electrolytes @xcite : @xmath46 the debye length , @xmath26 , is the characteristic screening length of a plasma at temperature @xmath47 with number density @xmath48 which is defined by @xmath49 for a neutral proton  electron plasma , the electron number density @xmath50 and ion number density @xmath51 are both @xmath52 , so the debye length is just @xmath53      although salpeter s expression accurately describes the effect of static screening , the issue of dynamic screening in the hot , dense plasma of the solar interior remains an open question .",
    "dynamic screening occurs when the screened interaction energy of a pair of ions depends on the relative velocity of the pair .",
    "most of the ions in the solar plasma are much slower than the electrons and the fastest ions .",
    "the thermal ions are therefore not able to rearrange themselves as quickly around individual faster moving ions . since nuclear reactions require energies several times the average thermal energy , the ions that are able to engage in nuclear reactions in the sun are the faster moving ions , which are not accompanied by a full static screening cloud .",
    "salpeter s derivation uses the mean - field approach in which the many - body interactions are reduced to an average interaction that simplifies calculations .",
    "this technique is quite useful for calculations describing the average behavior of the plasma . however",
    ", dynamic effects for the fast - moving , interacting ions in hot , dense plasma lead to a screened potential that deviates from the average value .",
    "therefore , the mean - field approximation is not appropriate for computing stellar nuclear reaction rates .",
    "instead , we use the molecular - dynamics method of @xcite to model the motion of protons and electrons in a plasma under solar conditions in order to investigate dynamic screening in _ p__p _ reactions .",
    "the advantage of the molecular - dynamics method is that it does not assume a mean field . nor",
    "does it assume a long - time average potential for the scattering of any two charges , which is necessary in the statistical way to solve poisson s equation to obtain the mean potential in a plasma .    in previous work , @xcite present simulation results for the velocity - dependent screening energy of _",
    "p__p _ reactions in a plasma with the temperature and density of the solar core ( @xmath54 k , @xmath55 @xmath56 ) .",
    "they demonstrate that the static screening result does not accurately represent this plasma , and they compute a screening energy that depends on the relative kinetic energy of a pair of interacting ions ( see figure [ fig : usim ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we use their simulation results to compute a correction to the solar _ p__p _ reaction rate due to the dynamic screening they observe .",
    "-0.4 cm    .3 cm",
    "we begin with the calculations of @xcite for a plasma of protons and electrons with the temperature and density of the solar core .",
    "their figure 5 shows the relationship between the total interaction energy at the turning point and the relative kinetic energy of a pair of interacting protons . as in salpeter s static screening derivation",
    ", we can split the total interaction energy into the coulomb and screening cloud contributions : @xmath57 the screening energy now includes a velocity dependence , so @xmath31 can no longer be factored out of the energy integral as was done to obtain equation [ eq : scr.lambda3 ] for the static screening case .    following salpeter s calculation for static screening , we focus on the contribution to the interaction energy from the screening cloud at small @xmath33",
    ". this value of @xmath31 is obtained from the relationship between the screening energy of a pair of protons at their turning point and their relative kinetic energy which is shown in figure [ fig : usim ] .",
    "the dynamic screening energy curve is described by the equation @xmath58 which comes from the best - fit curve for the @xcite @xmath59 .",
    "( note the difference in sign from @xcite , where the screening energy was defined as a negative contribution to the total energy , @xmath60 . in this paper",
    ", we use the @xcite convention , as shown in equations [ eq : int.energy1 ] and [ eq : int.energy2 ] . )",
    "now we return to equation [ eq : scr.lambda ] for the screened reaction rate per pair of particles . the assumptions and approximations used in the derivation of equation [ eq : scr.lambda ] for the static case",
    "will be examined and justified for the dynamic case in section [ subsect : assumptions ] . replacing @xmath31 from the statically screened case with @xmath61 for the dynamically screened case and using definition [ eq : sigma ] for the cross section , we have @xmath62   de.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because @xmath18 is a slowly varying function of energy , we make the approximation @xmath63 and replace this function with the constant @xmath21 , as was done in the original reaction - rate calculation in equation [ eq : lambda3 ]",
    ".    we can now evaluate the reaction rate per pair of particles using equation [ eq : lambda3 ] for the unscreened case and @xmath64de   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the statically and dynamically screened cases .",
    "equation [ eq : debye ] gives the static screening @xmath31 and equation [ eq : uofv ] gives the dynamic screening @xmath61 .",
    "because all three cases contain the factor @xmath65 , we only need to compute the integrals in order to compare ratios of the two screened cases to the bare coulomb potential case to obtain the correction factors for the _ p__p _ reaction rate .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ tab : integrals ] shows the results of the screening corrections for solar _ p__p _ reaction rates computed from the integrals in equations [ eq : lambda3 ] and [ eq : dyn.lambda2 ] .",
    "the statically screened correction shows a fairly large enhancement in the nuclear reaction rate .",
    "conversely , the dynamically screened reaction rate is almost the same as the unscreened rate .",
    "how does the dynamic screening energy seen in figure [ fig : usim ] result in a reaction rate that is so close to the unscreened reaction rate ? to answer that question , we compare the components of the the integrands from equations [ eq : lambda3 ] and [ eq : dyn.lambda2 ] . both integrands can be written in the general form @xmath66 where @xmath67 @xmath68\\ ] ] and @xmath69 the three cases only differ in the screening energy @xmath70 which is shown for each case in table [ tab : integrals ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ge ] , we see that the dynamic @xmath71 approaches the unscreened @xmath71 for high energies .",
    "figure [ fig : he ] shows that this leads to the dynamic @xmath72 approaching the unscreened @xmath72 for energies above @xmath732 @xmath74 , while the static @xmath72 is very different from both the dynamic and bare @xmath72 . below energies of @xmath732 @xmath74 the dynamic @xmath72 drops rapidly away from the unscreened value of 1 .",
    "however , the factor @xmath72 is multiplied by @xmath75 in the integrand of the reaction - rate equations . as seen in figure [ fig : je ] , @xmath75 is very small to zero below energies of @xmath732 @xmath74 , damping out the region of @xmath72 in which the unscreened and dynamic results diverge .",
    "this leads to integrands for the dynamic and unscreened cases that are nearly identical , as seen when @xmath72 and @xmath75 are multiplied together to give @xmath76 in figure [ fig : fe ] .",
    "the gamow - peak - like factor @xmath75 acts as a weighting function to devalue the @xmath72 contribution of the slow pairs of ions that rarely participate in nuclear reactions .",
    "the faster pairs that cause less polarization of the surrounding plasma and therefore see less screening provide the main contribution to the reaction - rate integral .",
    "now that we have defined the integrand @xmath76 for the dynamic case , we can return to the issue of assumptions and approximations that were justified in the static screening rate derivation and adopted in the dynamic screening rate derivation . here",
    "we assess the validity of these assumptions and approximations in the case of dynamic screening .",
    "the first assumption is that @xmath25 is very small compared with the charge cloud radius @xmath26 and that the nuclear radius @xmath27 is much smaller than @xmath25 , leading to expression [ eq : edep ] .",
    "although the dynamic case does not have a traditional static screening cloud , the inequality @xmath77 is still satisfied .",
    "this can be seen in the definition of @xmath78 as the distance beyond which an appreciable fraction of the nuclear charge is screened by the polarization charge cloud , a distance that is large for the dynamic case .",
    "next we examine the inequality in equation [ eq : ineq ] , @xmath79 . in the dynamic case , @xmath35 is the kinetic energy for which the integrand of equation [ eq : dyn.lambda2 ] is maximum .",
    "we see from figure [ fig : fe ] and @xmath31 in figure [ fig : usim ] that the peak of the integrand @xmath76 occurs at energies for which @xmath79 .",
    "finally , we address the approximation that @xmath30 can be replaced by the potential at the origin @xmath31 . while this is easy to see for the static case , in the case of dynamic screening we do not have the screening energy in the form @xmath80 to examine this claim .",
    "instead , we define @xmath61 to be the screening energy computed at the turning point of the approaching protons , since this is the relevant @xmath80 for nuclear reaction - rate calculations .",
    "in light of the contentious debate over the validity of dynamic screening , we devote this section to a discussion of arguments that have been made against dynamic screening .",
    "the argument for dynamic screening has been damaged by several derivations of alternate screening formulae ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that were subsequently shown to be incorrect . here",
    "we discuss two examples , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived a modified screening potential for fusing ions when the gamow velocity is greater than the thermal velocity .",
    "@xcite showed that including processes of excitation or de - excitation of the plasma in an interaction with one of the fusing ions exactly cancels the dynamic modifications proposed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite then introduced a factor of 3/2 on the screening energy .",
    "they arrived at this result by including the interaction of the the screening cloud from each fusing ion in the total interaction potential .",
    "@xcite showed that @xcite misinterpreted the thermodynamics and used an incorrect potential in the schrdinger equation for the system .",
    "@xcite summarize the problems with several different alternative screening formulae .",
    "however , finding flaws in these ( and other ) derivations of analytical expressions for screening deviations does not rule out the effect of dynamic screening .",
    "this argument only highlights the difficulty in developing a general analytical formalism to describe dynamic screening .",
    "for the gibbs distribution , probabilities for momenta and coordinates are independent and can not influence each other .",
    "this leads to the argument that velocities of fusing particles can not have an effect on screening because the distribution function is not factorable .",
    "however , it is clear when examining individual ions that their relative velocity affects how close the ions can be to each other .",
    "this argument extends to ions in a plasma , where the configuration of the screening cloud of approaching ions depends on the relative velocity of those ions . over the whole system ,",
    "this velocity - dependent effect averages out to the gibbs distribution , but each screening cloud is not identical to the average configuration of a screening cloud in that system .",
    "solar nuclear reactions select a biased sample of the ions in the system .",
    "these nuclear reactions involve mainly the fastest ions , not a random sample of all ions in the system .",
    "therefore the velocity distribution must be multiplied by the velocity - dependent screening energy before integration instead of beginning with an average value of the distribution .",
    "do dynamic screening results imply that higher - ordered terms are required ?",
    "the screening energy can be expressed as a power series expansion in the plasma coupling parameter @xmath81 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is given by @xcite .",
    "the first term reduces to the debye ",
    "hckel weak screening result shown in equation [ eq : debye ] .",
    "for the temperature and density of our simulations ( @xmath54 k , @xmath55 @xmath56 ) , @xmath86 , so higher - order terms are small .",
    "therefore , if dynamic screening could be described by higher - order terms in the expansion , the effect should be much smaller than the first term .",
    "however , the dynamic correction is not just a higher - order term in the expansion .",
    "dynamic effects come from a different approach to determining screening effects . instead of deriving an expression for screening based on average properties of the system",
    ", we examine the formation of the screening clouds themselves and do not average out the velocity - dependent nature of the clouds .",
    "what observational evidence can confirm any screening effect in the nuclear reactions in the sun ?",
    "many early discussions of dynamic screening were motivated by the neutrino problem which has since been resolved with neutrino oscillation theory .",
    "in addition , including dynamic screening corrections in models with the @xcite or @xcite abundances worsened agreement with helioseismic constraints ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the solar abundance problem provides renewed motivation for exploring dynamic screening in solar nuclear reactions .    before 2005 ,",
    "solar models with the latest input physics reproduced the sound - speed profile determined from helioseismic inversions to within @xmath87 and also provided good agreement with the seismically inferred convection zone depth and convection zone helium abundance .",
    "then @xcite , @xcite and @xcite began using three - dimensional hydrodynamic models of the solar atmosphere with improved input physics and non - local thermodynamic equilibrium effects to determine solar atmospheric abundances .",
    "these revised calculations lowered element abundances by up to 1/3 .",
    "when the lower abundances are incorporated in solar models , the sound - speed profiles , convection zone depths , and convection zone helium abundances give worse agreement with helioseismic constraints than models with the old , higher abundances .",
    "many attempts have been made to improve agreement by adjusting the physics or evolutionary assumptions in solar models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although these adjustments have shown some improvement , no model using the new lower abundances agrees as well with the helioseismic constraints as the models using the older abundances .    in a forthcoming paper ,",
    "@xcite incorporate the dynamic screening correction shown here for solar _ p__p _ reaction rates into solar models with the new lower abundances .",
    "they show that including this correction in solar models improves the sound speed discrepancy in the solar core , as shown in figure [ fig : sound_pp0 ] .",
    "this improvement does not fully reconcile the new abundances with helioseismic constraints , but it is a step in the right direction . perhaps in combination with other changes , dynamic screening corrections could contribute to a solution to the solar abundance problem .",
    "-0.4 cm    .3 cm",
    "we have shown that dynamic screening in solar _",
    "p__p _ reactions does not reproduce the enhancement of reaction rates that is predicted by salpeter s static screening approximation .",
    "in fact , the dynamic screening seen by @xcite shows essentially no correction to the unscreened reaction rate .",
    "although _ p__p _ reactions in the core are the main source of nuclear energy generated in the sun , this reaction - rate correction is only the beginning of understanding how including dynamic effects will alter a full solar model .",
    "the reaction - rate correction must be generalized to treat other temperatures , densities , compositions , and reactions .",
    "in addition , the effect of dynamic screening on the equation of state must be examined . until we can meet both of these challenges ,",
    "dynamic screening can not be incorporated completely and consistently in solar and stellar models ."
