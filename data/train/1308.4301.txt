    "there are many examples , both man  made and naturally occurring , of phenomena which begin with a small disturbance and end in a catastrophe . such events include electrical network failures @xcite , forest fires @xcite , avalanches @xcite , nuclear chain reactions @xcite , snapping ropes @xcite and landslides @xcite .",
    "a common feature of the distribution of the sizes of such events , and the mathematical property which links the very small to the very big , is power - law scaling .",
    "such scaling often appears over a number of orders of magnitude with the end of the power law region marked by an exponentially decaying probability density , referred to as an `` exponential cut  off '' @xcite .",
    "the values of the power law exponent , and the cut ",
    "off point will depend on the nature of the system , but often not on its fine details  a phenomenon known as universality @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of the cut ",
    "off may be the physical size of the system or its inherent ability propagate the cascade . for infinite systems",
    ", there exists a critical level of instability at which the distribution is a pure power - law . as the system approaches this critical point , the cut  off moves increasingly rapidly toward infinity , and the expected cascade size diverges .    in this work it is our aim to investigate the phenomenon of power law crossover in cascade size distributions .",
    "crossover occurs when the distribution of large cascades follows a different power law to that of small cascades .",
    "this type of behaviour was discovered @xcite in the distribution of bursts of snapping events in bundles of fibres under tension and close to complete breakdown .",
    "it is our aim to show that similar behaviour may be exhibited by a system in which cascades occur repeatedly over an extended period .",
    "each cascade has the effect of increasing the stability of the system so that subsequent cascades propagate less freely .",
    "such a stabilizing effect is seen , for example , in regions prone to forest fires where the extent and frequency of large fires has been reduced by planned burning of limited areas @xcite .",
    "another example is where the spread of disease through a population is reduced by the presence of recovered ( or vaccinated ) individuals , who act as firewalls preventing transmission @xcite .",
    "we might also expect to see a similar effect in terrain susceptible to landslides .",
    "in fact , there is some evidence of crossover behaviour in landslide size distributions @xcite .",
    "however , our model is not tied to one particular physical system , but rather it puts forward a generic explanation of how crossover behaviour might arise .",
    "our approach is to produce the simplest possible model ( and explanation ) of driven cascades , that is mathematically tractable , and that preserves some key features of real cascading phenomena",
    ".    the fundamental quantity of interest to us will be the ability of the system to propagate a cascade , which will be described by a single number , @xmath0 , the propagation power .",
    "in physical terms , this quantity might be determined by the connectivity of a network of unstable nodes , the density of unstable material in a system , or the average proximity of the components of a system to failure .",
    "because we view the propagation power as a measure of how easily cascades propagate between parts of system it will not depend on the absolute volume of the system  it is an intensive property .",
    "the dynamical properties of @xmath0 will be determined by two processes .",
    "first , @xmath0 will tend to increase over time , but with an element of unpredictability , described by brownian noise @xcite so that in the absence of cascades : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mean rate of increase of @xmath0 , @xmath3 is a standard wiener process @xcite , and @xmath4 controls the magnitude of the noise .",
    "the physical origin of such a process in , for example , a forest fire model might be the drying out of vegetation due to unpredictable weather , or in a landslide model , the natural variability of pore water pressure .",
    "we assume that the magnitude of the noise is independent of system size , and therefore it represents an external driving process .",
    "the second influence on @xmath0 arises from the cascades themselves , which act to stabilize the system . to capture this stabilizing effect",
    ", we suppose that if the size of the @xmath5th cascade since an arbitrary reference time is given by the continuous random variable @xmath6 , then in response @xmath0 changes by @xmath7 .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 measures the sensitivity of @xmath0 to cascades , and will depend on the size of the system , and the stabilizing effect on those parts of it that are involved in the cascade . for convenience , we will refer to @xmath8 as the `` inverse system size '' .",
    "note that the distribution of @xmath6 will itself depend on @xmath0 .",
    "we define @xmath9 to be the sum of all cascade sizes that have occurred since @xmath10 and let @xmath11 count the number that have occurred .",
    "we then have that : @xmath12 together with the driving dynamics ( [ driving ] ) we have a complete stochastic differential equation for @xmath13 : @xmath14 we will assume that cascades begin when a small part of the system spontaneously fails",
    ". since a larger system will have more potentially unstable material then the rate at which cascades begin should scale in proportion to the system size @xmath15 .",
    "assuming that the cascade rate is constant and independent of the cascade history , then the times between cascades will be exponentially distributed and @xmath11 will be a poisson process with intensity @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a constant of proportionality , independent of system size . without loss of generality in the model we can set @xmath18 by re  scaling time and adjusting @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "as we mentioned above , the distribution from which individual cascades sizes , @xmath6 , are drawn will depend on the value of @xmath0 when they occur .",
    "we write the probability density function of this distribution @xmath21 . in section [ casc ]",
    "we introduce a continuous state branching process to describe cascades , which we cap at size @xmath22 ( this cap is proportional to system size , and ensures that the propagation power can not become negative ) .",
    "we find that : @xmath23 where @xmath24 as @xmath0 approaches a `` critical value '' @xmath25 . at this critical point , @xmath21 is a pure power ",
    "law and the mean cascade size diverges . for @xmath26 , @xmath27",
    "so the power ",
    "law region is `` cut  off '' at approximately @xmath28 . when @xmath29 , the mean cascade size increases further still and is infinite in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "the divergence of the mean cascade size as the critical point is approached from below will create a self  stabilizing effect which pushes the system away from @xmath25 .",
    "the combination of this automatic stabilization and the upward drift of the driving process means that the propagation power will fluctuate about a mean value lying in the subcritical region .",
    "we will find that the magnitude of fluctuations is controlled largely by @xmath20 for large systems .    of central interest to us",
    "is the long term cumulative record of cascade sizes in the system , which we describe with a probability density function @xmath31 .",
    "this will be an average of @xmath21 over the values of @xmath0 at which cascades take place .",
    "we define @xmath32 to be the probability density function for the value of the propagation power at time @xmath33 .",
    "the `` steady state '' density function for @xmath0 is then @xmath34 .",
    "we then have that @xmath35 this expression may also be thought of as the probability density function for the size of the next cascade observed after some arbitrary ( but large ) time .",
    "one of our main results is to show analytically that fluctuations in @xmath0 about its typical subcritical value , causing it to approach temporarily closer to criticality , are what generates crossover behaviour in the `` averaged '' cascade distribution @xmath31 .    from the above arguments it is clear that typical value of @xmath0 , corresponding to the peak of @xmath36 , will be increased by increasing the driving rate @xmath19 . in the limit of infinite system size",
    "we will find that the stabilizing effect of diverging mean cascade size near @xmath25 means that it is always the case that @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath38 the system will sit at the critical point .",
    "similar behaviour is exhibited by the forest fire model @xcite , where the equivalent of @xmath19 is the rate of tree growth . because there are a wide range of parameter values for which both our model and the forest fire model are near critical ,",
    "both may be seen as examples of `` self organised criticality '' ( s.o.c . )",
    "the requirement that @xmath19 be sufficiently large in order for the system to be near criticality means that our model does not exhibit s.o.c . in its purest form , as seen in the sandpile @xcite",
    ". however , we can still draw analogy between the steady increase in @xmath0 and the addition of energy or particles in truly self organising models .",
    "suppose that each cascade begins when a small volume of the system experiences a `` failure '' event ( for example it may catch fire , explode , get infected or begin motion ) .",
    "this may induce further parts to fail and so on , forming a sequence of failures whose volumes @xmath39 are referred to as _",
    "generations_. we assume that the generations follow a _ continuous state branching process _ @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the sizes of the successive generations is encoded by an _ offspring _ distribution , @xmath40 .",
    "this is the probability distribution for the amount of failed material that each unit of the current generation triggers in the next .",
    "we assume that @xmath40 remains the same throughout the cascade .",
    "suppose that the zeroth generation of the process , @xmath41 , is an integer , then the size , @xmath42 , of the first generation is the sum of @xmath41 independent copies of a @xmath40-distributed random variable . in this case",
    "the distribution of @xmath42 is simply the convolution of @xmath40 with itself @xmath41 times , written @xmath43 . if @xmath41 is not an integer , we extend the idea of @xmath44-fold convolution , following seneta and vere  jones @xcite , as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath45 is a random variable drawn from the distribution @xmath40 .",
    "the function : @xmath46 is the laplace transform of @xmath40 . given this definition ,",
    "@xmath47 is the laplace transform of @xmath48 where @xmath49 . by relaxing the constraint that @xmath44 be an integer",
    ", we may define the laplace transform of @xmath42 , conditional on @xmath41 , to be @xmath50 , and then extend this rule to later generations : @xmath51 this recursive equation defines the relationships between the distributions of successive generations , giving a complete characterisation of the process once @xmath40 is defined .",
    "we will take @xmath40 to be the gamma distribution @xcite @xmath52 which has density function @xmath53 defined for @xmath54 , where the variables @xmath55 and @xmath56 are referred to as the shape and scale parameters .",
    "our choice of @xmath40 is motivated by the requirement that it have a physically plausible shape ( not bimodal ) , have defined moments , lead to mathematical tractability , and that @xmath57 $ ] for all @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , the asymptotic behaviour of the distribution of the total size of the cascade : @xmath59 will depend only on the mean and variance of the offspring distribution so we expect our crossover predictions would hold for other forms of @xmath40",
    ". a significant advantage of our particular choice is that for all real @xmath60 , @xmath61 , from which we see , via equation ( [ lapbranch ] ) , that our gamma branching process is defined by the relationship @xmath62 where @xmath41 is the volume of the first generation of the cascade . in equation ( [ bp ] )",
    "the symbol @xmath63 means `` is distributed as '' . using this recursive definition of the cascade , it is possible to compute the distribution of the total cascade size @xmath64",
    "however , we first fix the relationship between the offspring distribution and @xmath0 .",
    "we will allow this dependence to enter through the mean , @xmath65 , of the offspring distribution , so that the average volume contributed to each successive generation of the cascade per unit volume of the previous generation is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "we choose to let @xmath66 and leave @xmath5 as a free parameter which controls the variance and shape of @xmath40 .",
    "we will write the probability density function for @xmath64 as @xmath21 and consider first the case where there is no limit on how large cascades can become . we may calculate @xmath21 by interpreting @xmath64 as the first passage time of a random walk .",
    "however , the details of this calculation are somewhat technical , and are not part of our main story , so we confine them to appendix [ csbp ] .",
    "the resulting probability density function for @xmath64 is : @xmath67 \\frac { e^{- \\kappa z } } {     z^{3/2 } } \\text { as } z \\rightarrow \\infty \\label{psiasymp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where : @xmath68 in the context of equation ( [ psiasymp ] ) the symbol @xmath63 means `` tends asymptotically to '' . to the author",
    "s knowledge , equation ( [ psi ] ) is a new result in the theory of continuous state branching processes @xcite .",
    "considering equation ( [ psiasymp ] ) , when the mean of the offspring distribution is one ( @xmath69 ) , then @xmath70 , so the distribution is asymptotically a pure @xmath71 power law with infinite moments .",
    "the value of propagation power @xmath72 at which this behaviour occurs is referred to as the critical point .",
    "when @xmath73 the quantity @xmath74 gives the location of the exponential cut - off .",
    "provided @xmath75 , the distribution @xmath21 is normalised and its moments are defined .",
    "it is useful to have explicit expressions for the first two moments of @xmath21 in this case . in appendix [ csbp ]",
    "we show that , provided the cascade size is not limited by finite system size , then @xmath76 when @xmath77 the distribution ( [ psi ] ) is not normalized .",
    "this is referred to as the `` supercritical '' regime where infinitely large cascades become possible .",
    "the total probability weight is equal to @xmath78 . in appendix [ csbp ]",
    "we show that : @xmath79 where : @xmath80}(p)\\ ] ] and @xmath81 is one of the two real branches of the lambert w function @xcite , the other being @xmath82 .",
    "we will cap cascades at a maximum size @xmath83 so that they can not cause the propagation power to take negative values .",
    "this cap scales in proportion with the system size . assuming that cascades will stop abruptly once @xmath84 , then the tail of @xmath21 will replaced with a delta function @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the total probability weight in the tail , plus the probability of an infinite cascade : @xmath87",
    "the capped cascade distribution is therefore : @xmath88}(z ) \\psi_p(z ) + \\omega(z_{max } ) \\delta(z - z_{max}),\\ ] ] and the @xmath44th cascade moment in a finite system is : @xmath89 where the second term arises from integration over the delta function in the capped cascade density . for simplicity , for the remainder of the paper we will begin all cascades with a failure of volume @xmath90 .",
    "for arbitrary @xmath8 , the steady state distribution of the propagation power equation ( [ sde ] ) can not be found analytically , but may be determined by simulation .",
    "however , for small @xmath8 , jumps which are not small with respect to the system size become increasingly rare , and the dynamics of @xmath0 may be approximated by diffusion with drift , giving rise to a pure diffusion equation which is analytically tractable . in the limit @xmath30 , this approximation becomes exact . to illustrate the rarity of large jumps , figure [ sim ] shows a simulation of @xmath13 when @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in this case out of @xmath95 cascades only six exceeded @xmath96 of the system size , and the system reached criticality only once out of all recorded times .",
    "simulation of @xmath13 using parameter values are @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 and @xmath97 giving a critical @xmath0 value of @xmath98 .",
    "values of @xmath13 were recorded when the jump which preceded them exceeded @xmath99 of the system size .",
    ", width=7 ]    to derive our diffusion approximation we view @xmath0 as evolving in discrete steps , with its value being recorded immediately before each cascade .",
    "each change in @xmath0 is therefore comprised of a cascade , followed by a period of diffusion until the next cascade occurs .",
    "this defines a discrete time stochastic process @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the propagation power immediately before the the @xmath44th cascade .",
    "we let @xmath102 be the probability density function for @xmath101 .",
    "we then define @xmath103 to be the probability density function for the size , @xmath104 , of the next single step of the process given that the current value of propagation power is @xmath105 .",
    "note that @xmath103 is independent of @xmath44 .",
    "the master equation governing the evolution of @xmath102 is then : @xmath106 our aim is to find the steady state distribution : @xmath107 .",
    "before we continue our analysis of the master equation we will make clear the link between the distributions of discrete time process , and the underlying continuous time process ( [ sde ] ) . in section [ intro ] , we defined @xmath36 to be the steady state probability density function for the continuous process , @xmath13 , which may intuitively be thought of as the density function for the value of @xmath0 observed at an arbitrary time @xmath108 , large enough so that the influence of initial conditions is insignificant . due to the properties of exponential waiting times @xcite , the time interval , @xmath109 , between @xmath108 and the last cascade before @xmath108 will be exponentially distributed . letting @xmath110",
    "be the value of @xmath0 immediately after this last cascade , we see that @xmath111 .",
    "now let @xmath112 be another large time , but restricted to the set of cascade times so that we are making an observation of the discrete time process . again using the properties of exponential waiting times , the time @xmath113 since the previous cascade will have the same distribution as @xmath109 (",
    "intuitively this arises because @xmath108 is likely to lie in a larger than average waiting interval ) . because the value of @xmath0 just after the previous cascade will be drawn from the same distribution as @xmath114 , we have that @xmath115 where @xmath116 denotes equality in distribution . as a result ,",
    "observations of the discrete time and the continuous time process have the same distribution at large times : @xmath117 if the times between cascades were not exponentially distributed then the probability distribution of the state of the system immediately preceding a cascade would not , in general , be the same as the distribution at a randomly selected time . in that case equation ( [ meancasc ] ) would be incorrect because @xmath21 must be averaged over the distribution of @xmath0 immediately preceding a cascade .    to approximate the steady state solution to ( [ master ] ) we derive the corresponding kramers  moyal equation @xcite by expanding the integrand of ( [ master ] ) in powers of @xmath104 : @xmath118 substituting this approximation back into the master equation we find that : @xmath119 where we have made use of the normalisation of the step size distribution to simplify the first term .",
    "we now define the first two moments of step size to be : @xmath120 as @xmath30 , both the time between cascades and their effect on @xmath0 decline so the step distribution becomes increasingly sharply peaked about @xmath121 . we therefore ignore moments of higher order than two and obtain a discrete time analogue of the fokker ",
    "planck equation for pure diffusion : @xmath122 we are interested in the steady state behaviour of the process , where @xmath123 , and in particular we require the function @xmath36 , which from equation ( [ fp ] ) , satisfies : @xmath124 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\partial_{pp}\\left[b(p)f(p)\\right]\\ ] ] the first integral of this equation , the probability current @xmath125 , will be zero .    in the limit of large system size , for @xmath73 ,",
    "the probability of cascades which engulf the entire system is zero , and the system can never access the region @xmath126 because the mean cascade size diverges in the neighborhood of @xmath127 .",

    "we expect our approximation to break down near this critical point , and to breakdown globally if there is sufficient probability weight in the supercritical region where infinite cascades have nonzero probability .",
    "we will explore this breakdown using simulations .",
    "the first moment of the cascade distribution has asymptotic behaviour : @xmath133 which diverges near @xmath134 , creating an infinite negative drift .",
    "the probability weight at the critical point therefore declines to zero as @xmath30 and the divergence in @xmath129 will never be realised .",
    "we may therefore drop the @xmath131 term for infinite systems . making use of @xmath128 and the simplified @xmath129",
    "we see from equation ( [ j ] ) that the limiting form of @xmath36 satisfies : @xmath135 although the cascade distribution @xmath21 is not defined for @xmath136 , in the interests of tractability , we will take equation ( [ feqn ] ) as valid over the interval @xmath137 $ ] , yielding the following expression for @xmath36 : @xmath138 } ( 1-k p)^{\\frac{2}{k \\sigma^2 } } \\exp\\left[-\\frac{2 \\mu}{k \\sigma^2}(1-kp)\\right]\\ ] ] for all parameter values of interest to us , the probability weight in the invalid region @xmath139 $ ] is less than @xmath140 .",

    "we note that when @xmath176 the distribution of the first generation of the cascade possesses a maximum located away from zero and the cascade distribution inherits this characteristic . for the smaller system",
    ", the crossover fails to fully develop , and the exponent begins to increase again .",
    "this occurs because the distribution of propagation power does not decay to zero at the critical point , so the averaged cascade distribution includes significant contributions from values of @xmath0 for which @xmath21 is approximately a pure power law for @xmath177 .",
    "the breakdown of the diffusion approximation occurs in part because the frequency of cascades is insufficient to realise their divergent mean size on short time scales . in the larger system where @xmath178 we see that the crossover develops more fully .",
    "because cascades occur with greater frequency , fluctuations in the short term average of the cascade size are reduced .",

    ", width=8 ]      in figures [ mu ] and [ sig ] , we illustrate the role of the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 in determining the behaviour of the cascade distribution @xmath31 in the limit of large system size . figure [ mu ] shows that for fixed @xmath20 , the driving rate @xmath19 , which determines the location of the maximum of @xmath36 , fixes the location of the crossover . at larger driving rates , the crossover point shifts to larger cascade sizes .",
    "this is because , for larger @xmath19 , the peak of @xmath36 is nearer to the critical point .",
    "therefore the typical exponential cut  off scale is larger and the @xmath71 scaling region is extended .    in figure [ sig ] we see that a noisier driving process reduces the magnitude of the tail exponent , but the size of the @xmath71 region remains unaffected .",
    "increased variability in the driving process means that although the typical distance from the critical point is unchanged , the system spends more time in close proximity to it and therefore large cut ",
    "offs are more heavily weighted .    in both figures",
    "the asymptotic power ",
    "law predictions ( [ asymp ] ) for the cascade distribution give an indication of the size of the region over which the crossover occurs .",
    "we have presented a driven cascade model which , in the limit of large system size , exhibits power  law crossover behaviour in its cascade size distribution . for smaller systems , the crossover partially develops , but the distribution moves back toward the initial @xmath71 power law at larger cascade sizes , because the system is able to reach and exceed the critical value of propagation power .    the mechanism which generates the crossover is a competition between the driving process , which increases the instability of the system , and the cascade process , which reduces it .",
    "as the propagation power nears the critical point , @xmath25 , the mean cascade size diverges , so that in the limit of large system size , @xmath25 is not accessible for finite @xmath19 .",
    "the upper tail of the distribution of propagation power , @xmath36 , therefore decays to zero at @xmath25 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the averaged cascade distribution , @xmath31 , is determined by averaging the asymptotic behaviour of the cascade distribution for fixed propagation power , @xmath21 , over the upper tail of @xmath36 .",
    "the result is a power  law with exponent lower than @xmath71 , producing a crossover .",
    "we suggest that the presence of a crossover in a cascade size distribution may indicate that the system is able to self stabilize through frequent but non  catastrophic cascades , and that the mechanism which drives the instability of the system to cascading failure is inherently noisy . the stabilizing cascades act to prevent the system from reaching a fully critical state where very large cascades can occur . because our system will be near critical for a wide range of parameter values ( large enough @xmath19 ) , it may be considered to exhibit `` self organised criticality '' . however , the crossover is more obvious if the typical value of propagation power is not too close to criticality , and it has been our focus to explore crossover .",
    "it should also be noted that an infinite system will only become fully critical in the limit @xmath38 , whereas a finite system may become critical or supercritical through fluctuations .",
    "the location of the crossover indicates how close to criticality the system will typically be found , because it is determined by the peak of @xmath36 .",
    "it remains to adapt the ideas contained in our simple model to investigate real physical systems such as forest fires and landslides .",
