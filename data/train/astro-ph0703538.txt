    "while the study of the early - time x - ray afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has seen enormous strides since the launch of the _ swift _ satellite @xcite , progress in the understanding of the longer - wavelength emission has been somewhat more measured .",
    "this is unfortunate , as a complete understanding of _ swift _ afterglows can only come from a combined broadband picture that allows us to systematically investigate whether the peculiarities seen in x - ray data carry over into the optical domain .",
    "many of the same questions raised by recent x - ray results can also be asked about the optical .",
    "is there a prompt optical component , analogous to the steeply decaying component seen in x - rays @xcite ? does the optical light curve show unusual features suggestive of energy injection , such as the nearly ubiquitous x - ray shallow - decay phase @xcite ? are there achromatic optical and x - ray breaks ?",
    "do the optical and x - ray afterglows even have a common origin at early times ?",
    "previous studies have provided important hints .",
    "most observations have been interpreted to support the consensus picture of synchrotron emission originating from a forward shock as it sweeps through the interstellar medium ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , or less commonly through a stellar wind @xcite  see @xcite for a review . in a smaller number of cases @xcite ,",
    "very early - time data have provided tentative evidence for an additional emission component originating from the reverse shock as it travels backward into the shocked material in the frame of the forward shock .",
    "recently , studies of early - time light curves have also shown evidence of significant delay between the onset of the prompt emission and the afterglow @xcite , and in at least one case complicated energy injection activity as late as nearly an hour after the gamma - ray burst @xcite , long after the gamma - ray emission has faded away .",
    "however , simultaneous , correlated optical and gamma - ray emission has also been reported @xcite for some events . in the _ swift _ era , comparison to the very early x - ray afterglow",
    "has also been of great interest ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most interpretations of the early afterglow have been based on unfiltered observations , or observations in a single filter . without information about the frequency domain ,",
    "the reported early - time behaviors discussed above are difficult to definitively associate with any single physical interpretation .",
    "fortunately , the increasing number of fast - responding robotic ground - based observatories , the maturation of existing ones , and the rapid - response capabilities of _ swift _ are beginning to address this observational gap .    in the following discussion , we report on one of the brightest bursts of the _ swift _ era , grb061126 .",
    "the breadth and rapidity of the ground - based response to this burst were remarkable , including unfiltered detection during the prompt emission and multi - color simultaneous detections in filters from @xmath2 through @xmath3 ( ranging a full decade in frequency ) starting less than one minute after the burst trigger .",
    "this data set provides the opportunity to examine in unprecedented detail the time - dependent color properties of an early grb afterglow .    in  [ sec :",
    "obs ] we present our observations from infrared ( ir ) through gamma rays of the early afterglow and our late - time keck spectrum of the host , establishing the probable redshift of this system to be @xmath4 . in ",
    "[ sec : prompt ] we examine the properties of the prompt emission , and show that the high - energy and optical emission are observationally uncorrelated temporally or spectrally , even at very early times . in  [ sec : optlc][sec : optcolor ] we examine the properties of the optical  ir light curve , and provide evidence for a red - to - blue change in the spectral index of @xmath5 at early times .",
    "we investigate the x - ray behavior in  [ sec : closure ] , and show that no standard adiabatic model can fully explain the behavior seen by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) . finally , while in  [ sec",
    ": revshock][sec : optlate ] we show that the earliest afterglow appears reasonably fit by a reverse shock and the later afterglow by a forward shock based on the optical data alone , in ",
    "[ sec : bbfits ] we demonstrate that an extrapolation of the x - ray spectrum overpredicts the contemporaneous optical flux by a factor of 520 .",
    "we demonstrate using the optical  ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that this discrepancy can not be due to any known dust extinction law .",
    "unless we appeal to large quantities of grey dust , a possibility we discuss in  [ sec : greydust ] , we argue in  [ sec : compton][sec : separate ] that the x - ray and optical afterglow emission from this burst have separate physical origins .",
    "at 08:47:56 on 26 november 2006 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) , the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) triggered and located grb061126 .",
    "unfortunately , due to an earth - limb constraint , _ swift _ was unable to slew promptly to the target for 23 minutes and could not begin observations with the xrt or the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ) before that time .",
    "after 23 minutes , _ swift _ slewed to the burst position and detected a fading x - ray afterglow @xcite .",
    "we download the _ swift _ bat and xrt data from the _ swift _  archive .",
    "the xrt data are processed with version 0.10.3 of the xrtpipeline reduction script from the heasoft  6.0.6 software release .",
    "we employ the latest ( 19 december 2006 ) xrt and bat calibration files .",
    "we establish the bat energy scale and mask weighting by running the bateconvert and batmaskwtevt tasks , also from the heasoft  6.0.6 software release .",
    "bat spectra and light curves are extracted with the batbinevt task , and response matrices are produced by running batdrmgen .",
    "we apply the systematic error corrections to the low - energy bat spectral data as advised by the bat digest website .",
    "the spectral normalizations are corrected for satellite slews using the batupdatephakw task .",
    "the reduction of xrt data from cleaned event lists output by xrtpipeline to science - ready light curves and spectra is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the xrt , bat , and rhessi ( reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ) data are fit using isis . the xrt light curve is converted to normalized 100 kev flux using a scaling of 7.5 @xmath6jy / cps .",
    "rhessi @xcite is a dedicated solar observatory which uses nine germanium detectors to image the sun at hard x - ray to gamma - ray energies ( 3 kev ",
    "these detectors are unshielded and therefore frequently detect emission from off - axis grbs .",

    ", we have used monte carlo simulations and a detailed mass model .",
    "since rhessi rotates about its axis with a 4  s period , we have generated azimuthally averaged responses spaced @xmath7 apart in polar angle .",
    "these responses are two - dimensional matrices of effective area : input photon energy vs.  detected count energy bins . at present both energy axes are 64 logarithmic bins from 10 kev to 10 mev .",
    "we generate the response matrices with mgeant @xcite simulations : each response requires 64 simulations of a monoenergetic input spectrum , one for each photon energy bin . for an individual grb ,",
    "we generate and subtract a background count spectrum using data intervals before and after the burst .",
    "we generate a burst - specific response matrix with a weighted average of the two adjacent @xmath7 responses . convolving a spectral model with the response",
    "yields a model count spectrum for fitting to the grb data .",

    "such a late cooling break in the x - ray band would imply an extremely low density ( @xmath182 1 @xmath183 ) , inconsistent with an intragalactic environment and the high @xmath165 column density observed in the x - ray data .",

    "the afterglow evolution is dominated by radiative losses and has not yet transitioned to an adiabatic phase , even out to @xmath185  d. this case would predict that @xmath186 , within 1@xmath38 of the observed value .",
    "however , this requires that the synchrotron spectrum still be fast - cooling , which demands that the optical band be above the synchrotron critical frequency ( @xmath187 ) to produce a fading optical light curve in a constant - density medium .",
    "the specific , predicted value of @xmath188 is not statistically consistent with our observations of the optical decay index in this region , but it is possible that the measurement may be confused somewhat by the presence of soft breaks or other systematic effects .",
    "the x - ray light curve is affected by synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) losses , which would steepen the decay slightly relative to that predicted by a no - compton model @xcite .",
    "the amount of predicted steepening is , unfortunately , relatively low : @xmath189 , which for the x - ray inferred value of @xmath190 gives a constraint of the ssc - corrected decay index of @xmath191 , still off by @xmath192 from the observed value of @xmath193 .",
    "the x - ray emission is not due to a forward shock , or not due to synchrotron radiation .",
    "some combination of factors may also be at work . in any event , the specific resolution to this problem is not critical at this stage , and we will proceed assuming @xmath194 , which is independent of any assumptions about the burst environment and requires only that the source of the x - ray light be synchrotron radiation , where the x - ray band is above the cooling and minimum - energy breaks .",
    "in addition to identifying the spectral regimes , we also seek to identify the burst environment ( constant - density , wind - stratified , or a spreading jet ) .",

    ", we use the constraint @xmath196 1.5 , which is certainly true independent of the number of components used in our model . )",

    "is too steep for @xmath194 . ] furthermore , the subsequent passage of @xmath198 or @xmath199 through the optical bands should produce breaks in the optical light curves which can only accelerate the temporal decay , not decelerate it .",
    "the lack of flux excess in the first raptor measurement , and the extrapolation of the band model into the visible frequency range , argue against association with this emission to a prompt optical component from the internal shocks that ( presumably ) produced the high - energy emission .",
    "therefore , the most likely candidate to be responsible for this early optical emission is an external reverse shock which is produced when the forward shock begins to interact with the surrounding medium .",
    "such an explanation has been previously used by several authors to explain observed peculiarities in the early - time light curves of a number of grb afterglows @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived the temporal behavior of reverse - shock light curves for two different regimes : the thick shell ( corresponding to cases in which the reverse shock is able to become relativistic as it crosses back through the ejecta ) and the thin shell ( for cases where the shock always remains nonrelativistic ) .",
    "the thick shell case is associated with relatively long bursts , and in particular predicts that the peak of the reverse - shock emission will happen at about the same time as the burst itself , whereas the thin - shell case predicts an optical peak after the grb .",
    "as the raptor data indicate an optical light curve that is already rapidly declining during the prompt emission , we apply the thick - shell case here .",
    "( however , the thin - shell case gives identical numerical predictions for the region of interest for @xmath194 . )    before the shock crossing time @xmath200 , the reverse - shock light curve is expected to rise as @xmath201 , which as already discussed is not observed .",

    "observationally , the early - time average decay index is @xmath208 if we fit only a single component with no bump , though because of the bump feature the exact decay rate clearly varies ; given this complexity , a rigorous statistical comparison with the simplistic predictions is not possible .",
    "however , we can unambiguously rule out all cases except for the slow - cooling case in which @xmath202 , where , if we use the value of @xmath167 from the late - time x - ray spectrum , we predict @xmath209 , which is generally consistent with our observations .",
    "our early - time multi - color photometry provides us with a rare opportunity to test the spectral predictions of reverse - shock models , in addition to the time - domain predictions .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum of a reverse shock is predicted to be identical in its general form to that from a forward shock , with the exception that after the reverse shock crosses the shell ( at time @xmath200 ) , there is no emission from frequencies above some cutoff frequency @xmath210 .",
    "the spectral power - law indices are the same ( for the same value of @xmath167 ) , although the break frequencies @xmath211 and @xmath212 are generally not .    for the reverse shock , the only regime consistent with the data is @xmath202 .",
    "the prediction for the spectral index in this region ( from @xcite ) is @xmath213 . again assuming @xmath175 from the late - time x - ray observations , we predict that the spectral index should be @xmath214",
    "this is significantly less than the observed value ( after correcting for galactic extinction ) of @xmath215 .",
    "this very large discrepancy may be due to host - frame extinction .",
    "however , as we will discuss in  [ sec : bbfits ] , the lack of observable curvature in the seds of either the fast - decaying or the slow - decaying components impose strong constraints on the amount and nature of any extinction .",
    "the fast - decaying early - time optical component is subsumed by the shallower late - time component at around @xmath126  s. the natural inclination is to assume that the reverse - shock emission has been replaced by that from a forward shock .",
    "as already discussed , the different decay rates of the x - ray and optical light curves rule out the possibility that they are in the same synchrotron regime , so we expect the optical band to be below a spectral break . for adiabatic evolution ,",
    "if the optical band is below the cooling break , we expect ( assuming @xmath216 ) an optical decay index of @xmath217 .",
    "this is consistent with the data , both in the empirical model where we assume a power law that fades throughout the observations ( for which we calculate @xmath218 ) and the more realistic fit in which the slow component rises , experiences a ( chromatic ) break , and then fades ( @xmath149/dof @xmath219 for this model , slightly better than the best model assuming an unbroken slow decay . ) for radiative evolution and the case that the optical band is below the minimum - energy break ( but above the cooling break and the critical frequency ) , @xmath220 , which is only consistent within 2.5@xmath38 .",
    "if the slower decay component is due to an adiabatic forward shock and the optical band is in the range @xmath221 then the predicted intrinsic optical spectrum is @xmath222 , which for @xmath223 suggests @xmath224 .",
    "if the forward shock is radiative , the prediction is the same but with no statistical uncertainty ( @xmath154 = 1/2 ) .",
    "the observed spectral index of the possible forward - shock component is somewhat redder than this value , @xmath225 = @xmath226  or , using our physical model , the post - peak @xmath225 = @xmath227 .",
    "again , one may appeal to host - galaxy extinction to make up the difference .",
    "we will examine this possibility in greater detail in the next section .",
    "for now , however , we can sidestep the host extinction question completely if we look only at the _ change _ in spectral index between the early ( reverse shock ) and late ( forward shock ) components , as long as we can assume that the extinction is constant with time .",
    "as discussed earlier , the only reverse - shock model consistent with the observed early - time light curve requires that either @xmath221 ( adiabatic ) or @xmath228 ( radiative ) , both of which predict the same value for the spectral index for @xmath229 .",
    "we reach the same conclusion with the later - time data , meaning that the reverse and forward shocks are in the same synchrotron regime and should therefore have the same color as long as @xmath167 is the same .",
    "however , we do in fact observe a color change between the two components , of @xmath230 in our model .",
    "there are several possible interpretations for this .",
    "most likely , the forward shock is not strictly in the @xmath221 regime at the transition time , but is in fact still in the process of breaking from its very blue rising portion ( that is , @xmath231 ) , and does not attain its `` true '' color until significantly later , when it will shift back to the reverse - shock color .",
    "our data are quite consistent with this possibility ; the physically motivated fit which models the reverse shock as a rising and falling with the appropriate change in spectral index over its peak is equally sound as the fit assuming no rising portion ; the ultimate change in spectral index in this model is @xmath232 , consistent with no change within 2@xmath38 .",
    "if this is the case , we predict that the afterglow color will shift back towards the red after the end of our observations .    alternatively , one of our assumptions could be in error .",
    "it is possible that the value of @xmath167 is different between the forward and reverse shocks ; in this case a difference of @xmath233 would be required .",
    "also , the amount of extinction could in fact be variable due to dust destruction by the grb , though the general constancy of the early - time spectral index in figure [ fig : betaplot ] before the transition time seems to speak against this possibility .",
    "finally , if the optical or x - ray emission is strongly affected by another process such as compton scattering , this could also produce spectral variability .    of course",
    ", a combination of two or more of these factors is also possible .",
    "the light curve fits performed in our analysis naturally give rise to spectral fits .",
    "the filter - dependent flux parameters @xmath129 give the relative fluxes in each filter for both components of the light curve , and can be used to calculate the observed sed and look for signs of host extinction .",
    "we have already referred to the best - fit spectral indices @xmath154 for the fast and slow components , all of which were fit assuming no host extinction .",
    "here we will use different extinction models to constrain the properties of any host - frame dust in greater detail .",
    "large amounts of extinction are implied by the x - ray to optical sed . in figure",
    "[ fig : sedxo ] we plot the sed of the `` slow '' component as computed at @xmath234  s , shortly before the end of our multi - filter observations and after the beginning of the xrt observations .",
    "a model for galactic extinction of @xmath235 mag has been subtracted .",
    "the predicted x - ray to optical slope , and the predicted slope in the optical  ir frequency window , is @xmath236 in the adiabatic case and also @xmath237 in the radiative case , so the prediction is the same .",
    "in fact , however , we measure a nearly flat x - ray to optical slope of @xmath238 ( using the @xmath18-band and 1 kev fluxes ) , and an ir - optical slope of @xmath239 .",

    "grbs in general ( and grb061126 is no exception ) occur at high redshift and in very low - mass , high star - formation galaxies , and dust properties may evolve with time and almost certainly do correlate with host - galaxy type .",
    "furthermore , if grb progenitors are very massive stars , they should occur near their birth sites ( probably within dense clouds ) ; in the milky way , such environments are known to be correlated with anomalous extinction curves and high values of @xmath255 @xcite .",
    "finally , the grb itself is expected to destroy dust within several parsecs of its progenitor , which can preferentially affect certain types of dust  for example , destroy smaller grains while leaving the larger grains relatively untouched @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this is not the first grb in which the observed optical flux has been deficient relative to the x - ray flux , or relative to a late - time synchrotron prediction using the optical decay rate . in many cases",
    "a relatively normal extinction law [ except , in nearly all cases , for the lack of the characteristic 2175  bump feature seen in the milky way and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ] has successfully explained the suppression ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although we caution that without broadband photometry ( including ir measurements ) it can be difficult to accurately distinguish different models , and extinction laws other than the standard milky way , lmc , and smc laws are often not tested .",
    "even so , in many other cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the low - redshift dust models clearly do not work  in these cases , the optical data are consistent with an unabsorbed power - law , but one that disagrees with an extrapolation from the x - ray band .",
    "most of these authors favor a grey - dust interpretation of one manner or another .",
    "unusual reddening laws have also been reported from observations of supernovae @xcite and high - redshift quasars @xcite .",
    "unusual dust probably remains the simplest explanation for the flux discrepancy .",
    "nevertheless , at least two factors give us pause when considering this explanation .",
    "first , our fits to the optical data alone simply do not require it .",
    "there is no physically compelling reason that we can think of why dust should exhibit an extinction law that simply transforms one power law to another , requiring @xmath261 or something mimicking it within our observational uncertainties . from the optical data",
    "alone , it is more natural to assume that the excellent power - law sed is intrinsic , and look elsewhere to explain the disagreement with the x - ray data .",
    "second , the observed dust - to - gas ratio , while seeming to favor large amounts of extinction , actually greatly overpredicts the extinction if we assume a physical interpretation of the relatively grey extinction law in terms of dust that is mostly bound up in large grains .",
    "the grain size distributions presented by @xcite , for example , are already biased ( as weighted by the grain volume ) toward the largest grains , so for the same dust - to - gas ratio , skewing the grain distribution further toward large grains will significantly decrease the opacity at long wavelengths but also decrease it at short wavelengths .",
    "when the anticipated low dust - to - gas ratio of the grb host galaxy is considered , the observed x - ray @xmath165 column is already only just enough to explain the observed extinction ; suppressing it further by binding the available dust into very large grains becomes problematic .    nevertheless , without a detailed physical modeling of the potential dust in the grb environment ( including the possible effects of time - variable opacity due to dust destruction )",
    ", we can neither firmly confirm nor rule out the presence of grey dust in this burst .",
    "such an examination is beyond the scope of our present analysis ; however , we encourage dust modelers to make use of our observations of the minimum extinction required ( figure [ fig : extcurves ] ) to help determine the viability of grey - dust models for this event .",
    "our early - time infrared and optical photometry should strongly constrain any models involving dust destruction .",
    "we now turn to interpretations in which the optical sed is treated as intrinsic , and instead look to processes primarily affecting the x - rays to explain the anomalous behavior .",
    "the discrepancy between the x - ray @xmath99 and @xmath154 independently argues that the x - ray emission for this burst may not obey the normal assumptions about grb afterglows .",
    "the sed in figure [ fig : sedxo ] , if intrinsic , has two peaks , reminiscent of the spectrum created by inverse - compton scattering from a synchrotron source .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting that the observed optical spectral index is consistent with the x - ray spectral index : perhaps the x - ray afterglow is dominated by inverse synchrotron self - compton flux boosted from the optical band .",
    "compton scattering has not commonly been invoked in interpreting grb afterglow observations , but it has been used to explain x - ray / optical flux discrepancies similar to this one in at least two previously published cases : grb000926 @xcite and grb030227 @xcite .    however , we consider ssc unlikely to be the solution to our discrepancy for several reasons",
    ".    1 .   even admitting for the effect of compton scattering on the light curve , the optical data do not obey the predictions of any model without an extinction correction . the optical and x - ray have very similar spectral slopes ( @xmath262 , @xmath163 ) , suggesting that the x - ray photons are in fact upscattered optical photons , and that ( nongray ) extinction is minimal , so this value of @xmath154 must be treated as intrinsic .",
    "this restricts us to two synchrotron regimes : @xmath263 or @xmath264 .",
    "the former case would imply @xmath194 and requires a light curve that falls off as @xmath265 , which is ruled out by the observations .",
    "( the optical light curve decays quite slowly : @xmath266 during our observations , though it steepens later . )",
    "the latter case would imply @xmath267 , and predict @xmath268 , which is also ruled out .",
    "2 .   inverse - compton scattering does not produce a broken power - law sed at high energies ; @xcite have shown that in reality the breaks are significantly softened , in disagreement with the x - ray observations which indicate a simple power - law spectral slope .",
    "3 .   finally , it is difficult to construct the compton - scattered portion of the broadband sed without `` contaminating '' the optical bands with compton - scattered flux from lower energies in a way that would noticeably bias the blue end of our photometric sed .",
    "( however , this effect may be alleviated somewhat if the compton - boosted self - absorption frequency @xmath269 is not much less than the compton - boosted cooling frequency @xmath270 , since this would make the low - energy side of the compton - scattered spectrum much steeper than what is otherwise a very slowly falling ( @xmath271 ) low - energy tail . )      finally , we consider the possibility that the emission regions for the optical and x - ray emission are spatially distinct .",
    "there may be two forward shocks ( each peaking in a different energy range ) resulting from a two - component jet @xcite , or the entire optical afterglow may be due to a reverse shock with an erratic profile extending out to late times ( as in @xcite ) , while the x - ray light curve may be due to a more well - behaved radiative forward shock .",
    "the notion of finding a way to physically separate the optical and x - ray emission has recently found support in other contexts , in particular to try to resolve the apparent lack of correlation between _ swift _ x - ray and optical breaks @xcite and to explain _",
    "swift _ x - ray breaks generally @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the relatively short period of overlap between the optical and x - ray data for grb061126 prevents us from being able to constrain this possibility in any detail for this event .",
    "however , we will note that any two - origin explanation shares the difficulty just discussed in the context of whether inverse compton may explain the x - ray flux excess  that is , how to avoid contaminating the blue end of the observed optical spectrum with emission from the low - energy tail of a synchrotron - like spectrum peaking at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "we have presented multi - wavelength , early - time observations of the recent , bright grb061126 . in our favored model ,",
    "the early optical data appear to be well explained by a reverse shock .",
    "the reverse - shock emission fades rapidly and is dominated by emission from the forward shock from @xmath17500  s onward .",
    "a small color change is observed at this transition , likely due to the peak of the forward - shock synchrotron spectrum passing through the optical band at roughly the same time .",
    "however , only with significant contrivance can this model also explain the x - ray observations from the _ swift _ xrt , which are much brighter than an extrapolation of the optical flux would predict .",
    "the optical flux may be suppressed by host - galaxy extinction , but this would require a remarkably grey dust law , capable of generating 1.53 mag of optical extinction without causing the observed @xmath2@xmath3 sed to deviate from a power law . alternatively ,",
    "the x - ray and optical emission may be due to two physically or spatially distinct emission processes , but our observations strongly restrict the positions and sharpness of any spectral breaks and cast doubt on the viability of this model .    in either case",
    ", we advise caution in interpreting future early afterglows in the absence of data sets that are not well sampled both spectrally and temporally .",
    "many previous studies , by necessity , have been restricted in either their temporal properties ( sampling ) , frequency coverage ( available filters and wavebands ) , or both . under the standard fireball model",
    "these assumptions seemed valid , as only a single parameter set would fit them . here",
    "we show that when a more complete picture is available , no parameter set seems to fit the data , unless we invoke large quantities of grey dust or separate origins for the x - ray and optical afterglows .",
    "the very bright x - ray afterglow and late - time optical faintness are enough to qualify this event under some definitions as a dark gamma - ray burst in spite of the extraordinary bright early afterglow . had the event been intrinsically fainter or at higher redshift , or had the optical follow - up observations been delayed significantly , the optical afterglow may have been missed entirely . therefore , it is possible that events like grb061126 may represent a significant fraction of dark bursts .",
    "the most common interpretation of dark bursts is that they are due to absorption of the optical flux by host - galaxy dust or by neutral hydrogen at very high redshift .",
    "our study presents tentative evidence for a third possibility , which is that the optical faintness may be intrinsic to the grb itself , due to enhancement of the x - ray flux or intrinsic suppression of optical flux , or both .",
    "if the optical faintness is due to dust , our results suggest that near - ir and optical observations alone may not be as constraining as once hoped , since any extinction must not cause significant deviations from a power law , even across a decade in frequency from the near - ir to the uv .",
    "however , the combination of near - ir , optical , and x - ray observations remains a potent tool for understanding grbs , and we anticipate that additional multi - wavelength observations in the coming years will continue to shed light on `` anomalous '' events like grb061126 .",
