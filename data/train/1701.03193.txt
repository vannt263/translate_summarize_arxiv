    "the idea is that the arc - transitivity of the cube can be `` lifted '' to `` transitivity of the nonzero blocks in the matrix @xmath604 '' , which can be combined with using the cyclic group within the blocks .",

    "we thus would like to know the nullity of the matrix @xmath615 using elimination and decomposition , we found that @xmath616      the cases @xmath619 and @xmath620 give rise to the cube and the nauru graph , respectively . by theorem  [ thm :",
