    "while the lhc methodically examines the energy scale of the electroweak theory and above , it is time to recall the two criteria for evaluating a physical theory , mentioned by a. einstein  @xcite .",
    "the first point of view is obvious : a theory must not contradict empirical facts , and it is called the `` external confirmation '' . the test of this criterion both for the standard model and its various extensions is now engaged in the lhc .",
    "the second point of view called the `` inner perfection '' of the theory , may be very important to refine the search area for new physics .",
    "all existing experimental data in particle physics are in good agreement with the standard model predictions .",
    "however , the problems exist which could not be resolved within the standard model and it is obviously not a complete or final theory .",
    "it is unquestionable that the standard model should be the low - energy limit of some higher symmetry .",
    "the question is what could be this symmetry .",
    "and the main question is , what is the mass scale of this symmetry restoration .",
    "a gloomy prospect is the restoration of this higher symmetry at once on a very high mass scale , the so - called gauge desert .",
    "a concept of a consecutive symmetry restoration is much more attractive .",
    "it looks natural in this case to suppose a correspondence of the hierarchy of symmetries and the hierarchy of the mass scales of their restoration .",
    "now we are on the first step of some stairway of symmetries and we try to guess what could be the next one . if we consider some well - known higher symmetries from this point of view , two questions are pertinent .",
    "first , is nt the supersymmetry@xcite as the symmetry of bosons and fermions , higher than the symmetry within the fermion sector , namely , the quark - lepton symmetry  @xcite , or the symmetry within the boson sector , namely , the left - right symmetry  @xcite ?",
    "second , would nt the supersymmetry restoration be connected with a higher mass scale than the others ?",
    "the recent searches for supersymmetry carried out at the tevatron and the lhc colliders  @xcite shown that no significant deviations from the standard model predictions have been found , the vast parameter space available for supersymmetry has been substantially reduced and the most probable scenarios predicted by electroweak precision tests are now excluded or under some constraints after the new stringent limits .",
    "we should like to analyse a possibility when the quark - lepton symmetry is the next step beyond the standard model .",
    "along with the `` inner perfection '' argument for this theory , there exists a direct evidence in favor of it . the puzzle of fermion generations is recognized as one of the most outstanding problems of present particle physics , and may be the main justification for the need to go beyond the standard model .",
    "namely , the cancellation of triangle axial anomalies which is necessary for the standard model to be renormalized , requires that fermions be grouped into generations .",
    "this association provides an equation @xmath2 , where the summation is taken over all fermions of a generation , both quarks of three colors and leptons , @xmath3 is the 3d component of the weak isospin , and @xmath4 is the electric charge of a fermion . due to this equation , the divergent axial - vector part of the triangle @xmath5 diagram with a fermion loop vanishes .    the model where a combination of quarks and leptons into generations looked the most natural , proposed by j.c .",
    "pati and a. salam  @xcite was based on the quark - lepton symmetry .",
    "the lepton number was treated in the model as the fourth color . as the minimal gauge group realizing this symmetry",
    ", one can consider the semi - simple group @xmath6 . to begin with",
    ", one can take the group @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "the fermions were combined into the fundamental representations of the @xmath1 subgroup , the neutrinos with the _ up _ quarks and the charged leptons with the _ down _ quarks : @xmath9 where the superscripts 1,2,3 number colors and the subscript @xmath10 numbers fermion generations , i.e. @xmath11 denotes @xmath12 and @xmath13 denotes @xmath14 .",
    "the left - handed fermions form fundamental representations of the @xmath15 subgroup : @xmath16 one should keep in mind that when considering the mass eigenstates , it is necessary to take into account the mixing of fermion states  , , to be analysed below .    let us remind that such an extension of the standard model has a number of attractive features .    1 .",
    "as it was mentioned above , definite quark - lepton symmetry is necessary in order that the standard model be renormalized : cancellation of triangle anomalies requires that fermions be grouped into generations .",
    "2 .   there is no proton decay because the lepton charge treated as the fourth color is strictly conserved .",
    "rigid assignment of quarks and leptons to representations   leads to a natural explanation for a fractional quark hypercharge .",
    "indeed , the traceless 15-th generator @xmath17 of the @xmath1 subgroup can be represented in the form @xmath18 it is remarkable that the values of the standard model hypercharge of the left - handed quarks and leptons combined into the @xmath15 doublets turn out to be placed on the diagonal .",
    "let us call it the vector hypercharge , @xmath19 , and assume that it belongs to both the left- and right - handed fermions .",
    "4 .   let us suppose that @xmath20 .",
    "the well - known values of the standard model hypercharge of the left and right , and _ up _ and _ down _ quarks and leptons are : @xmath21 then , from the equation @xmath22 , taking eq .   into account , one obtains that the values of the right hypercharge @xmath23 occur to be equal @xmath24 for the _ up _ and _ down _ fermions correspondingly , both quarks and leptons .",
    "it is tempting to interpret this circumstance as the indication that the right - hand hypercharge is the doubled third component of the right - hand isospin .",
    "thus , the subgroup @xmath8 may be @xmath25 .",
    "`` under these circumstances one would be surprised if nature had made no use of it '' , as p.  dirac wrote on another occasion  @xcite .    the most exotic object of the pati ",
    "salam type symmetry is the charged and colored gauge @xmath26 boson named leptoquark .",
    "its mass @xmath27 should be the scale of breaking of @xmath1 to @xmath28 .",
    "bounds on the vector leptoquark mass are obtained both directly and indirectly , see ref .",
    "the direct search@xcite for vector leptoquarks using @xmath29 events in @xmath30 collisions at @xmath31 tev have provided the lower mass limit at a level of 250300 gev , depending on the coupling assumed .",
    "much more stringent indirect limits are calculated from the bounds on the leptoquark - induced four - fermion interactions , which are obtained from low - energy experiments .",
    "there is an extensive series of papers where such indirect limits on the vector leptoquark mass were estimated , see e.g. refs .",
    "the most stringent bounds@xcite were obtained from the data on the @xmath32 decay and from the upper limits on the @xmath33 and @xmath34 decays . however , those estimations were not comprehensive because the phenomenon of a mixing in the lepton - quark currents was not considered there .",
    "it will be shown that such a mixing inevitably occurs in the theory .",
    "an important part of the model under consideration is its scalar sector , which also contains exotic objects such as scalar leptoquarks .",
    "we do not concern here the scalar sector , which could be much more ambiguous than the gauge one .",
    "such an analysis can be found e.g. in refs .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : update ] basing on a new data from cms and lhcb collaborations on the rare decays @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "as the result of the higgs mechanism in the pati  salam model , fractionally charged colored gauge @xmath26-bosons , vector leptoquarks appear .",
    "leptoquarks are responsible for transitions between quarks and leptons .",
    "the scale of the breakdown of @xmath1 symmetry to @xmath28 is the leptoquark mass @xmath27 .",
    "the three fermion generations are grouped into the following @xmath36 representations of the @xmath37 group : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the color index to be further omitted .",
    "it is known that there exists the mixing of quarks in weak charged currents , which is described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix .",
    "therefore , at least one of the states in , @xmath40 or @xmath41 , is not diagonal in mass .",
    "it can easily be seen that , because of mixing that arises at the loop level , none of the components is generally a mass eigenstate . as usual , we assume that all the states in , with the exception of @xmath41 , are initially diagonal in mass .",
    "this leads to nondiagonal transitions @xmath42 through a quark - leptoquark loop , see fig .  1 .",
    "as this diagram is divergent , the corresponding counterterm should exist at the tree level .",
    "this means that the lepton states @xmath43 in are not the mass eigenstates , and there is mixing in the lepton sector .",
    "other nondiagonal transitions arise in a similar way . hence , in order that the theory be renormalizable , it is necessary to introduce all kinds of mixing even at the tree level .",
    "[ fig : x_loop ]    as all the fermion representations are identical , they can always be regrouped in such a way that one state is diagonal in mass .",
    "the most natural way is to diagonalize charged leptons . in this case",
