    "fig .  [ sketch_pore ] depicts schematically the driven translocation of a structured polynucleotide from the _ cis _ to the _ trans _ side of the pore .",
    "we seek here a convenient reduced description of this translocation process , rather than modeling the full three - dimensional polymer dynamics explicitly .",
    "our approach is similar in spirit to the existing models for the case of unstructured polymers @xcite , where the translocation dynamics is formulated in terms of a single variable , e.g. the number of nucleotides , @xmath4 , on the _ cis _ side , see fig .",
    "[ sketch_pore ] .",
    "the dynamics , @xmath5 , is stochastic and can be described by ` hopping rates ' , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , for forward and backward motion of the nucleotide chain through the pore with a stepsize of one monomer .",
    "the external force on the molecule leads to an imbalance in the hopping rates , @xmath8 , and hence a mean drift towards the _ trans _ side . for unstructured molecules the one - dimensional description is permissible , if the relaxation of the polymer degrees of freedom on both sides of the pore is faster than the hopping process",
    "this assumption does not hold for arbitrarily long polymers , since the relaxation time increases with the polymer length @xcite , however for lengths on the order of a thousand bases , the one - dimensional description is adequate under typical experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "the residual effect of the polymer ends is then only to introduce an entropic barrier for translocation , which leads to a weak @xmath4-dependence of the hopping rates .    for structured molecules ,",
    "the translocation dynamics is considerably more complicated , since the dynamics of the ` reaction coordinate ' , @xmath5 , is then coupled to the dynamics of the basepairing patterns on both sides : the structure on the _ cis _ side , @xmath9 , affects the forward rate , while the structure on the _ trans _ side , @xmath10 , affects the backward rate , @xmath11    m & \\stackrel{k_+(m,\\,{{\\cal s}}_{trans}(t))}{{\\setlength{\\unitlength}{1 cm }     \\,\\begin{picture}(2,0.1)\\vector(1,0){2}\\end{picture}\\ , } } & m+1 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in two limiting cases however , the process can be modeled by a one - dimensional brownian walk as for unstructured molecules , but with a complex sequence / structure - dependent free energy landscape @xmath12 along the coordinate @xmath4 : ( a ) if the dynamics of the basepairing patterns @xmath9 and @xmath10 is much faster than the hopping process , the landscape is determined by the ensemble free energy of all basepairing patterns on the _ cis _ and _ trans _ side .",
    "( b ) in the opposite limit , the basepairing pattern on the _ cis _ side is essentially frozen and is unzipped basepair by basepair as it is driven through the pore .",
    "the landscape is then determined by the basepairing energetics of the particular molecular structure prior to translocation , see below . in both cases , the free energy naturally decomposes into three parts , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the intrinsic binding free energies of the _ cis _ and _ trans _ parts of the molecule , while @xmath16 describes the effect of the external force . given @xmath12 ,",
    "the simplest form for the hopping rates @xmath17 which satisfies the detailed balance condition @xmath18}$ ] ( with @xmath19 ) is @xmath20 here , @xmath21 denotes a microscopic rate constant , which can in principle be tuned by adjusting the properties of the pore .",
    "it can be interpreted as a friction coefficient and corresponds approximately to the bare hopping rate for unstructured molecules at zero external force ( typical experimental estimates for @xmath21 are on the order of @xmath22 @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamics of the translocation process , as described by eqs .",
    "( [ general_fe ] ) and ( [ hopping_rate ] ) is dominated by energetic barriers due to basepairing , whereas the above - mentioned entropic barrier is completely negligible for structured molecules .",
    "these energetic barriers lead to arrests during translocation , as clearly observed already in the experiments with simple hairpins @xcite and double - stranded dna @xcite .",
    "* qualitative aspects . *",
    "we now make use of the theoretical framework constructed above to investigate which information on structured molecules could be derived from pore translocation experiments . to this end , it is useful to compare unzipping by driven translocation through a nanopore with the more conventional way of unzipping by applying a force on the ends of a biopolymer , see e.g. @xcite . as illustrated in fig .  [ comparison ] ,",
    "the two approaches differ fundamentally : pulling on the ends induces a spontaneous unfolding order for the individual structural elements , which is a function of their relative stabilities and the topology of the structure .",
    "in contrast , the nanopore prescribes a linear order along the sequence , and unfolds an rna molecule much as enzymes such as the ribosome do in cells .",
    "this difference suggests that the two approaches can also yield different types of information about the molecule under study . as demonstrated by onoa _",
    "@xcite , clever use of the pulling on the ends approach can reveal detailed information on the ( un)folding pathway of an rna molecule with known structure .",
    "however , when the structure of an rna molecule is unknown , pulling on the ends can provide , by itself , little information beyond a count of the number of structural elements that unfold separately @xcite . in the following we therefore focus on the question of how much structural information",
    "may in principle be obtained with the nanopore approach .",
    "let us suppose that we were able to observe the trajectories @xmath5 of the molecules during the translocation process .",
    "we could then assign a position within the sequence to each arrest during translocation . since an arrest is caused by a kinetic barrier , i.e. a stem trapped at the entrance to the pore",
    ", we could thereby identify the positions of the stems in the structure .",
    "such information can indeed be sufficient to reconstruct almost the entire basepairing pattern of a molecule , as we demonstrate explicitly using an example below .",
    "if the translocation dynamics is in the strongly driven limit ( b ) where the structure on the _ cis _ side is essentially frozen , then the reconstructed structure would correspond to the initial structure of the molecule before translocation .",
    "we concentrate on this limit in the following , including a discussion of its attainability . however , it may be noteworthy that in the slow translocation limit ( a ) one would also obtain useful structural information , namely on the average structure of the molecule ( with respect to the thermodynamic ensemble of all structures @xcite ) . as long as the molecule is ` well - designed ' this average structure will be dominated by the ground - state , i.e. the minimum binding free energy structure .",
    "how could one possibly observe the trajectories @xmath5 during translocation ? for the purpose of structure determination , we will need @xmath5 with a spatial resolution below the typical length of a stem in an rna structure ( 510 basepairs )",
    ". this may be achievable through a refinement of the current nanopore technology , such that careful analysis of the ionic current allows a count ( or even sequencing ) of the bases that have passed the pore @xcite . with artificial solid - state pores",
    "@xcite it is also conceivable to use a tunneling current through leads within the membrane as a probe to count ( or sequence ) the bases as they pass through the pore . here , we explore yet another option , namely pulling the molecule mechanically through the pore , with a device that can record force - extension curves , e.g. an atomic force microscope or optical tweezers .",
    "the explicit discussion of this case with an exemplary rna sequence serves us to gauge the more general capability of nanopores as single - molecule tools for the study of biopolymer folding .",
    "* quantitative aspects . * mechanical unfolding of a biopolymer yields characteristic sawtooth - shaped signatures in the force - extension curve ( fec ) indicating the opening of structural elements within the molecule , see e.g. @xcite . from the relative positions of these sawteeth one can determine length changes within the molecule with an extremely high resolution of about 1  nm . in the usual setup where the molecule is unfolded by pulling on its ends ,",
    "such length changes can only be used to infer the ` stored length ' of a structural element , but not its precise position along the backbone of the molecule , cf .",
    "[ comparison ] .",
    "in contrast , for mechanical pulling through a pore , the relative positions of the resulting sawteeth will correspond directly to the relative positions of the structural elements in the sequence .",
    "one conceivable way to prepare the initial condition where an rna molecule is almost entirely on the _ cis _ side , with one end threaded through the pore and attached to a pulling device on the _ trans _ side , is to start with an attached molecule on the _ trans _ side and to apply a voltage pulse across the pore that suffices to drive the molecule as far as possible to the _ cis _ side .    to apply our general model to the particular case of mechanical pulling in the strongly driven ( fast pulling ) limit ,",
    "we need to specify the form of the three terms in the free energy landscape ( [ general_fe ] ) .",
    "the second term , i.e. the binding free energy on the _ trans _ side , may be set to zero , @xmath23 since the reformation of structure after translocation is suppressed at high tensions in the rna single strand at the unfolding force @xmath24  pn . at a pulling speed of",
    "say @xmath25 m/s , the translocation of an rna molecule with a thousand bases would therefore be terminated before refolding of a structural element on the _ trans _ side occurs . ] .",
    "the third term , @xmath16 , describes the effect of the mechanical stress on the rna , which stretches the single - stranded",
    "_ trans _ part of the molecule .",
    "the elastic response of this single - strand may be modeled by a freely jointed chain ( fjc ) polymer model .",
    "assuming for simplicity a constant pulling speed @xmath26 , the third term then takes the form @xmath27 here , the function @xmath28 denotes the combined free energy of a single - stranded rna of @xmath29 bases in series with a linear spring , stretched to a total extension @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "( the linear spring takes into account the stiffness of the force - measuring device , see the appendix for details . ) by assumption , the first term , @xmath14 , represents the binding free energy of the remaining part of the initial structure on the _ cis _ side .",
    "@xmath14 can be calculated for any initial structure , based on the free energy rules for rna secondary structure @xcite with a natural extension for pseudoknotted structures , see the appendix .",
    "our assumption of a frozen structure on the _ cis _ side is most likely an oversimplification for realistic pulling speeds , since small fluctuations in the secondary structure are known to occur already on timescales on the order of tens of microseconds @xcite .",
    "however , since the pore pulling approach is sensitive only to stem positions , we expect that it is unaffected by small fluctuations and sensitive only to major rearrangements which significantly change the secondary structure .",
    "such rearrangements are typically slow , sometimes even on the timescale of hours @xcite .",
    "* reconstruction of secondary structures . * to illustrate the problem and the method , we use an exemplary rna , the well - studied self - splicing intron of _ tetrahymena thermophila _",

    "the rising parts of the sawteeth correspond to stretching of single strand on the _ trans _ side as a stacked region is `` trapped '' in front of the pore on the _ cis _ side . when a stacked region opens , some single strand is freed to pass the pore , which leads to relaxation of the tension and causes the downstrokes in the fec s . note that the fec s do not share all of their sawteeth , which reflects the importance of thermal fluctuations for this type of single molecule experiments ( this property is manifest also in the experiment of onoa _ et al . _",

    "the dashed lines are freely jointed chain fec s whose lengths are fitted to some of the positions that correspond to translocation arrests.,width=321 ]    the most relevant information contained in the fec s are the positions of the translocation arrests , during which the required force for the opening of basepairs is built up . to extract these positions , we use fec s of freely jointed chains with different lengths : the dashed lines in fig .  [ fig_quickpull ]",
    "show some examples of such fec s where the chain length @xmath29 coincides with the length of the rna single strand on the _ trans _ side during such an arrest .",
    "with an automated procedure described in the appendix we obtain all of these positions ( above a threshold for the duration of an arrest ) .",
    "since the bases around the position of an arrest are very likely basepaired with another segment of the sequence further to the 5 end , we represent this information by a closing angular bracket , ` @xmath36 ' , above that position in the rna sequence ( written from 5 to 3 ) , see fig .",
    "[ figreconstruction ] . of course",
    ", the molecule can also be pulled through the pore in the other direction , i.e. from the 5 end .",

    "[ figstruct ] , such a representation is shown in the third row of fig .",
    "[ figreconstruction ] .",
    "note that two types of brackets have to be used for the pseudoknotted native structure , in order to make the association between opening and closing brackets unambiguous .",
    "we observe that the angular brackets extracted from the fec s can be viewed as an incomplete bracket representation of the rna secondary structure .",
    "can we complete it using only the given sequence of the rna molecule ?",
    "this task is a sequence alignment problem , which consists of matching each opening ( closing ) bracket with an associated downstream ( upstream ) binding sequence .",
    "several circumstances conspire to make this , somewhat surprisingly , a nontrivial problem : ( i ) stems , i.e. contiguous basepaired regions , are usually short , typically 510 basepairs , ( ii ) structural elements often lead to a different number of angular brackets in the two pulling directions , i.e. not every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and _ vice versa _ , and ( iii ) sequence segments containing several u s have many possible binding partners , since u s can pair with a s and g s .",
    "to overcome this problem , we developed a probabilistic sequence alignment algorithm ( see appendix ) , which identifies the most likely set of stems that is consistent with all angular brackets and where all paired sequence segments contain at least one angular bracket on each side .",
    "the output of this algorithm is shown in the fourth rows of fig .",
    "[ figreconstruction ] , where lower case letters indicate paired sequence segments and the alphabetic order represents the confidence level ( confidence is largest for ` a ' ) . in fig .",
    "[ figstruct ] the bases involved in this reconstructed set of stems are colored , with green ( red ) indicating ( in)correct basepairing .",
    "we observe that the two different basepairing patterns ( for the same sequence ) are clearly distinguished and the large scale secondary structure is captured in both cases . in particular , the pseudoknot in the native structure is correctly identified .",
    "the only incorrectly predicted stem is the least significant one ( ` k ' ) in the pseudoknotted structure .",
    "while these results seem satisfactory as a proof of principle , we stress that our reconstruction algorithm can certainly be improved upon , e.g. by allowing for mismatches in longer stems , which should help to fill in many of the missed basepairs .",
    "also , one could make use of the known basepairing energies in the reconstruction .",
    "our theoretical study has led us to a simple coarse - grained model , eqs .",
    "( [ general_fe]-[hopping_rate ] ) , for the translocation of structured polynucleotides , which is applicable in the two opposite limits of very slow and very rapid translocation .",
    "this model is a useful starting point for a more detailed description that remains valid in the entire parameter regime . here",
    ", we have applied the model to demonstrate that the physics of the translocation process can in principle be exploited to use nanopores for secondary structure determination ( including pseudoknots ) on the single - molecule level .",
    "indeed , the nanopore technique would be a useful addition to the existing repertoire of structure determination methods : rna secondary structure can be predicted computationally to some extent @xcite based on experimentally determined free energy rules @xcite , however this approach is unreliable for rna molecules exceeding @xmath38 bases and can not take pseudoknots properly into account . including pseudoknots , which are often crucial to the function of rna enzymes @xcite , is not only computationally expensive @xcite , but is also limited by a lack of experimental information on the corresponding binding free energies .",
    "experimentally , x - ray crystallography @xcite or nmr @xcite provide detailed structures , but these techniques are cumbersome and limited to small molecules or isolated domains of larger rnas",
    ". structural information for larger rnas can currently only be obtained from comparative sequence analysis @xcite , which requires large sets of homologous rna sequences , or from indirect biochemical methods @xcite .    throughout this paper , we have focused on basepairing only , which is permissible under ionic conditions that disfavor tertiary interactions , e.g. low sodium and no magnesium . however , once the translocation of a molecule is well characterized under these conditions , it becomes interesting to switch to the native ionic conditions and examine the effects of tertiary interactions .",
    "generally , one can expect more cooperativity in the presence of tertiary interactions , i.e. larger domains will open in a single step , as observed by onoa _",
    "this suggests a hierarchical approach to structure determination with nanopores : first unzip under low ionic conditions to obtain the secondary structure , and then repeat in the presence of magnesium to identify how the secondary structure elements are grouped into larger tertiary structure domains ( such as the p4-p6 domain in the _ tetrahymena _ ribozyme ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress the advantage of rna as a model system to separately study the effect of secondary and tertiary structure .",
    "in contrast , the secondary structure of proteins is not stable in the absence of tertiary structure , and hence one may expect that single - domain proteins will unfold and translocate across a pore in a single step .",
    "nanopores could in principle also be used to probe the kinetics of large - scale secondary structure rearrangements in single - molecules .",
    "for instance , it would be useful to attach larger objects to both ends of a molecule that is already threaded through the pore , allowing the same molecule to be driven forth and back through the pore , over and over again . by varying the time interval between successive reversals of the driving force , one",
    "could then probe structural relaxation over a broad range of time scales .",
    "more generally , nanopores may emerge as a new tool to probe intra- and inter - molecular interactions in single biomolecules .",
    "for instance , one could probe the biophysics of combined binding and folding in the context of rna - protein interactions .    * acknowledgments .",

    "<S> we investigate theoretically the translocation of structured rna / dna molecules through narrow pores which allow single but not double strands to pass . </S>",
    "<S> the unzipping of basepaired regions within the molecules presents significant kinetic barriers for the translocation process . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this circumstance may be exploited to determine the full basepairing pattern of polynucleotides , including rna pseudoknots . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial requirement is that the translocation dynamics ( i.e. , the length of the translocated molecular segment ) needs to be recorded as a function of time with a spatial resolution of a few nucleotides . </S>",
    "<S> this could be achieved , for instance , by applying a mechanical driving force for translocation and recording force - extension curves ( fec s ) with a device such as an atomic force microscope or optical tweezers . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis suggests that with this added spatial resolution , nanopores could be transformed into a powerful experimental tool to study the folding of nucleic acids .    </S>",
    "<S> a series of recent experiments studied the translocation of dna and rna molecules through narrow pores , which allow single but not double strands to pass @xcite , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a review . </S>",
    "<S> these investigations pursued two main goals : ( i ) to probe in a well - defined model system the physics of biopolymer translocation across membranes , a process which is ubiquitous in cell biology , and ( ii ) to explore the potential of nanopores as a single - molecule tool . in the experiments so far , a membrane protein , @xmath0-hemolysin , was used as the pore . </S>",
    "<S> an electric field acting on the negatively charged dna / rna backbone drives the molecules through the pore , and translocation is monitored by measuring the induced ionic current , which is strongly reduced while a dna / rna chain blocks the pore . until very recently @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the experiments have focused on the translocation of unstructured , mostly homopolymeric molecules , a problem which has also received considerable theoretical interest @xcite . for such unstructured molecules , </S>",
    "<S> the main results regarding the above goals were that ( i ) the basic physics of translocation is adequately described by a drift - diffusion process , in which monomers hop randomly in and out of the pore with a directional bias due to the applied voltage @xcite , and ( ii ) nanopores could possibly be developed into rapid sequencing devices , since the ionic current during blockage displays a weak sequence - dependence @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for structured polynucleotides , both the basic physics and the potential applications of translocation still remain largely unexplored . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , important first steps have been taken by studying the translocation of simple hairpin ( i.e. , stem - loop ) structures @xcite and the unzipping of double - stranded dna through a nanopore @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a general theoretical framework to describe translocation of these as well as more complex rna / dna structures is currently lacking . here , we first construct such a framework and then use it to investigate the potential of nanopores as a single - molecule tool for the study of biopolymer folding .        in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we are interested in the generic physical aspects of the translocation process that neither depend on the specific properties of a particular protein pore , nor on the detailed way in which the driving force for translocation is applied . as in previous theoretical studies </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we use a coarse - grained model which treats the pore basically as a separator between a _ cis _ and a _ trans _ part of the molecule with a characteristic friction coefficient , see the sketch in fig .  [ sketch_pore ] . presumably this description will apply directly to solid - state nanopores @xcite , which can now be fabricated with sizes down to @xmath1  nm , not much larger than the @xmath2  nm aperture of the @xmath0-hemolysin pore and slightly smaller than the @xmath3  nm diameter of double - stranded dna or stems in rna . </S>",
    "<S> also , we do not consider the full three - dimensional ( tertiary ) structure of the molecules , but focus on the basepairing pattern , i.e. the secondary structure including possible pseudoknots , which are the only structural features present when there are no divalent metal ions in the solution . unless stated otherwise , the term ` structure ' refers here to this basepairing pattern . while both our theoretical framework and our conclusions apply equally to rna and single - stranded dna </S>",
    "<S> , the rna case is particularly interesting , since structured rna s have a multitude of functions in molecular biology and rna folding is an active field of research @xcite . </S>"
