    "in a high - energy , high - brightness hadron collider , the coherent dynamics of colliding beams is dominated by beam  beam interactions .",
    "the non - linearities of the beam  beam force introduce a tune spread largely exceeding the one from other sources , such as non - linear fields , and provide sufficient stability for any pure impedance instabilities . when they interact with each other , the two beams will couple , resulting in coherent oscillations . in the case of equal beams and tunes",
    "these coherent oscillations can be described by two eigenmodes , corresponding to either in - phase or out - of - phase oscillation , respectively the @xmath0- and @xmath1-modes .",

    "beam modes are generally not self - excited and require some external mechanism to become unstable , such as the machine impedance . when studying the stability of colliding beams , it is therefore necessary to consider both processes simultaneously .",
    "past studies have shown that the combination of beam  beam interactions and impedance could lead to coherent instabilities . however , these studies were performed either using a linearized model @xcite or for very specific cases applied to the tevatron @xcite . during the 2012 proton run of the lhc , coherent instabilities",
    "were routinely observed @xcite , triggering a renewed interest to pursue these studies . in this paper , we present a refined model allowing one to study the interplay of beam  beam and impedance using the full lhc impedance model @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate mostly on single - bunch effects and associated stabilization techniques and present preliminary results for multibunch effects .",

    ".,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    although it seems that any instability involving head - on interactions could be cured with the transverse damper , the situation is more complicated when looking at offset collisions and even more for long - range interactions .",
    "two mechanisms can degrade the situation : the reduction of the tune spread and the absence of synchro  betatron coupling in the case of long - range interactions .",
    "figure [ g_qp_lr ] shows the instability rise time as a function of transverse damper gain and chromaticity in the case of long - range interactions .",
    "all the interactions are lumped in one location and the tune shift was set to be equivalent to 10 long - range interactions with a separation of 10@xmath0 . in this case , either chromaticity or damper only is not sufficient to damp the instability .",
    "there is however a correlated dependence : the higher the gain the lower the chromaticity required to stabilize the beams and inversely . in 2012 , the lhc was operated with both high gain and chromaticity .",
    "both these parameters are known to degrade beam lifetime and emittance ; these results indicate that there should be room for optimization of these parameters which should be considered during lhc recommissioning in 2015 .    adding a full head - on interaction significantly increases the tune spread and",
    "consequently damps all long - range types of instabilities .",
    "this is consistent with experimental observations @xcite and indicates that operating the transverse damper during physics stores may not be required as long as sufficient tune spread is provided and tune shifts at which the coupled mode instability occurs are avoided .",
    "previous results were produced using the single - bunch approximation . in the lhc ,",
    "the filling pattern , long - range interactions and symmetry of the collision points should be considered to give a more realistic picture of the coherent beam dynamics . in such configuration",
    ", each bunch encounters a different set of beam  beam interactions , leading to significantly different incoherent and coherent effects .",

    "only long - range interactions in a single ip were considered .",
    "the top plot shows the case of two bunches per beam , each bunch colliding only once on either side of the ip , and is therefore similar to the single - bunch case .",

    "although much weaker , this instability is also observed when the beam  beam modes cross the head ",
    "tail modes @xmath242 .",
    "this is an interesting feature which deserves further investigation , as the effect of the damper on such higher order mode coupling instabilities is unclear .",
    "as the number of bunches is increased , and hence the complexity of the collision pattern , a lot of modes with different frequencies appear and consequently mode coupling instabilities occur for most beam  beam parameters .",

    "in particular , mode coupling instabilities are observed for separations from 11 to 16@xmath0 at frequencies around the horizontal tune , 0.31 .",
    "the separation at which the instabilities occur depends on the beam  beam parameter and synchrotron tune .",
    "the instabilities observed in the tracking code only , at frequencies between 0.316 and 0.325 , originate from the vertical plane and therefore do not appear in the cmm , which models one plane only .",
