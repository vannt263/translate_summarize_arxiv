    "flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes have attracted renewed attention since the recent cleo measurement of the fcnc decays of the type @xmath2 . since in the standard model ( sm )",
    "these processes are forbidden at the tree level and hence are strongly suppressed by the gim mechanism , they offer a unique possibility to test the ckm sector of the sm .    based on the decays of @xmath3 mesons it will not be possible to analyse the helicity structure of the effective hamiltonian mediating the decay @xmath2 , since the information on the handedness of the quarks is lost in the hadronization process . the only chance to access the helicity of the quarks is to consider the decay of baryons .",
    "heavy  to  light transitions between ground state baryons are in large parts of the phase space restricted by heavy quark symmetries . for the baryonic transition @xmath4 light spin-1/2 baryon the number of independent form factors is restricted to only two . however , it is expected that heavy quark symmetries work best for such a kinematic configuration where the outgoing light hadron is almost at rest , corresponding to the point of maximum momentum transfer . for the decay under consideration , @xmath5 , we are at the opposite side of phase space where @xmath6 .",
    "we shall still use the relations implied by heavy quark symmetry although there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect that they hold at @xmath6 .",
    "this is motivated from models based on the diquark picture which phenomenologically work quite well .    another theoretical difficulty with the process suggested is possible long distance contributions which will dilute the effects of a non  sm  contribution to the short distance effective hamiltonian for @xmath5 .",
    "such contributions can only be estimated in terms of models but they turn out to be small .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for this specific decay consists in the sm of only one operator , in which ( up to tiny effects from the strange quark mass ) the @xmath7quark is right  handed and the @xmath8quark is left  handed .",
    "generalizing this we introduce couplings constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that the effective hamiltonian takes the form : h_eff=4g_fv_ts^*v_tb c_7 o_7 , _ 7 = m_b |s _ ( g_v - g_a_5 )",
    "b f^ in the standard model @xmath11 and @xmath12 from a leading log qcd calculation .",
    "we shall use @xmath13 and @xmath14 as parameters describing strength and helicity structure of the short distance process .",
    "it remains to calculate matrix elements of the operators . in the present case",
    "we shall make use of the fact that the @xmath7 quark is heavy , while the @xmath8 quark is taken to be a light quark .",
    "in general , heavy quark symmetries restrict the number of possible form factors quite significantly ; in the present case there are only two , parametrized by @xcite [ heavytolightdecay ] = |u_(p , s ) \\ { f_1(p.v)+v f_2(p.v ) } u__b ( v , s ) @xmath15 is an arbitrary dirac matrix , such that any transition between a @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and a light spin @xmath18 baryon is given by the same form factors . as mentioned in the introduction , ( [ heavytolightdecay ] )",
    "is expected to work best at @xmath19 , but we shall use this relation also at @xmath6 , which is in the worst case a model assumption .",
    "the quantity of interest is the decay rate of unpolarized @xmath20 baryons into @xmath21 baryons with a definite spin directions @xmath8 .",
    "this rate can be written in terms of the polarization variables as defined in @xcite = _ 0 where @xmath22 is the momentum vector of the @xmath21 and @xmath23 is its spin vector . here",
    "@xmath24 depends on the sum @xmath25 only and the other dependence on @xmath9 and @xmath10 is contained in  & = & 0.378 .",
    "[ alphadef ] the polarization variable depends only on the ratio of the form factors for which we have assumed a constant value and which has been extracted by cleo to be @xcite @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore we have used he ratio of the baryon masses @xmath27 .",
    "in addition to the short distance part there are also long distance contributions to @xmath0 : one type of long distance contributions involves a virtual @xmath28 that subsequently decays into the final state photon , this is a vector meson dominance like contribution .",
    "the other type of short distance contribution arises from a @xmath29boson being exchanged between two of the internal quark lines , the photon is radiated off any of the internal quark lines .",
    "we have estimated both these contributions employing a vector dominance type model in combination with factorization and a simple diquark picture for the internal @xmath29exchange .",
    "both contributions are small ; the former can be expressed as a correction to the short distance couplings @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( magnitude indicated by the width of the lines in fig.[gagvfig ] ) and the latter one is negligible .",
    "we extract the relevant form factors from the decay @xmath1 , which is according to ( [ heavytolightdecay ] ) given by the same two form factors as @xmath0 . to do",
    "so we must make a model for the @xmath30dependence of the form factors .",
    "starting from a simple pole model , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass of the nearest resonance with the correct quantum numbers for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we use the relation between @xmath30 and @xmath35 as well as heavy quark symmetry to obtain      where @xmath37 is found from the masses of the respective resonances for both form factors . in ( [ dipol ] ) and ( [ poleforms ] ) @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote monopole and dipole phase space depencence , respectively",
    ". we shall give our final results for both these models .",
    "for simplicity we have assumed the same @xmath40dependence for both of the form factors which again allows us to use the phase space averaged measurement of @xmath41 for the ratio of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    using the data for rate for @xmath1 @xcite",
    "we obtain an expression for the total decay rate of @xmath0 in which only the depencence on the fifth power of the mass of the @xmath7 quark introduces a sizable uncertainty . to eliminate this uncertainty we compare the decay @xmath0 to the semileptonic decay of the @xmath3 meson which exhibits the same @xmath44 dependence . using the lifetimes and the inclusive semileptonic branching fraction @xmath45 from @xcite",
    "we obtain br(_b ) = ( 1- 4.5 ) 10 ^ -5 , where the lower and upper value correspond to the dipole and monopole @xmath30 evolution of the form factors , respectively .    for values of @xmath10 and @xmath9 different from the standard model ones one has to multiply the above equation by the factor @xmath46 , neglecting the strange quark mass and the long distance contributions .",
    "in the following we shall use the measurement of the inclusive rate @xmath47 to fix @xmath48 ; in the @xmath13@xmath14plane a measurement of any total rate ( meaning any of the processes @xmath47 , @xmath49 or @xmath0 ) will correspond to a circle , since all these decay rates are proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "if in future experiments a measurement of @xmath50 in @xmath0 is performed one may use the relation between @xmath50 and @xmath51 . including our estimate of the long distance contributions , one obtains @xmath52 which corresponds to straight lines in the @xmath14@xmath13 plane .    in fig.[gagvfig ]",
    "we plot the @xmath14@xmath13 plane .",
    "the central circle corresponds to the central value of the measurement of @xmath47 and the thin circles indicate the experimental uncertainty . assuming the standard model values for @xmath14 and @xmath13 we have also plotted the corresponding lines .",
    "the width of these lines is given by our estimate for the long distance contributions ; we have taken this estimate as an additional uncertainty meaning that the width of these lines is @xmath53 .",
    "a measurement of @xmath50 yields in general two lines which have in total four intersections with the circle .",
    "the two intersections of each line correspond to a sign interchange @xmath54 and at the same time @xmath55 which is an unobservable phase .",
    "the remaining ambiguity corresponds to the interchange @xmath56 and @xmath57 , since the polarization variable and the total rate are symmetric functions of @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "graphically this means that the two lines for a measured value of @xmath58 are mirror images of each other with respect to the lines @xmath59 . in order to resolve this ambiguity additional measurements",
    "would be necessary .    in the sm @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) up to corrections from the non - vanishing @xmath8 quark mass ,",
    "therefore the two solid lines almost coincide for the sm value of @xmath50 . for illustrations",
    "we also have plotted two dashed lines for a hypothetical measurement of @xmath62 .    with a branching ratio for @xmath0 of the order @xmath63 one needs @xmath64 @xmath7 quarks to have about one hundred events , without applying cuts for efficiencies .",
    "clearly this will be feasible at dedicated @xmath7 physics experiments at colliders such as the one at tevatron or lhc , and possibly also at fixed target experiments like hera - b ."
