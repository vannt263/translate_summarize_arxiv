    "single - molecule magnets ( smms ) are molecules with a relatively large net spin moment ( corresponding to the spin number @xmath0 ) and a significant uniaxial magnetic anisotropy .",
    "@xcite as a result , behavior of smms resembles much that of superparamagnets , and at low temperatures the molecules become trapped in one of the two metastable spin states @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite owing to this bistability , smms seem to be a suitable base for memory cells of future information storage and processing technology .",
    "@xcite apart from this , smms can possibly become basic components of the molecular - based spintronic devices .",
    "@xcite    electronic transport through an individual smm has been demonstrated experimentally only very recently ,  @xcite attracting also a significant theoretical attention .",
    "@xcite an important issue in this context is the question of how the molecule s spin can be switched between the two stable states by means of spin - polarized current .",
    "this question is important not only from the purely fundamental reasons , but also from the point of view of possible applications of smms in various magnetoelectronic devices , and particularly as memory cells .",
    "it is already well known that when a spin - polarized current flows through a magnet , some amount of spin momentum can be transferred from the current to magnetic body ,  @xcite leading effectively to a spin - transfer torque .",
    "this additional torque may lead to magnetic switching or current - induced precessional states .",
    "it has been shown recently , that exchange interaction between spin - polarized current and a smm embedded in the barrier of a magnetic tunnel junction can lead to reversal of the molecule s spin .",
    "@xcite the model considered there was simplified as the current was not flowing through the molecule , but rather directly between magnetic electrodes . however , the tunneling electrons could interact with the smm _ via _ the exchange coupling , leading to switching of the smm .",
    "the main objective of the present paper is to investigate theoretically a more realistic mechanism of smm s switching , when the spin - polarized current flows directly through the molecule ( molecular single - electron transistor geometry ) . in",
    "the model assumed , the current flows _ via _ the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of the smm .",
    "we restrict , however , our consideration to the case of the sequential transport regime . the results clearly show that transport of electrons through the lumo level can lead to magnetic switching of the molecule , when the electrons in the lumo level interact _ via _ exchange coupling with the spin moment of the inner core of the smm .    in sec .",
    "ii we present the model and basis of the theoretical analysis of transport characteristics .",
    "numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "these results clearly show the possibility of magnetic switching induced by current pulse .",

    "the model to be considered , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , consists of a smm weakly coupled to two ferromagnetic electrodes ( also called here leads ) .",
    "we assume that the electronic transport through the molecule takes place only _ via _ the lumo level of energy @xmath5 ( measured from the fermi level of the leads at equilibrium ) .",
    "this level is assumed to be exchange - coupled to the smm s spin .",

    "@xcite the perpendicular anisotropy terms have been omitted as irrelevant for the effects described here .",
    "apart from this , we neglect intrinsic spin relaxation , eg . that due to spin - phonon coupling .",
    "the only spin relaxation taken into account is that due to coupling of the molecule to the electrodes .",
    "this is justified as spin relaxation due to electronic processes associated with coupling of the dot to external leads is the dominant one .",
    "the next term of @xmath16 describes the ferromagnetic electrodes , @xmath17 where @xmath18 stands for the left ( right ) lead .",

    "these parameters will be used in the following to describe strength of the coupling between the smm and leads .",

    "( [ eq : tranratefinal ] ) @xmath76 together with @xmath77 constitute basic selection rules for transitions between neighboring molecular states .",
    "the transition is allowed only when the charge state of the smm is changed by one and the change in the total spin satisfies @xmath78 .",
    "assuming that the smm is initially saturated in the state @xmath79 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , one may expect that at a sufficiently large voltage the molecule can be switched to the final state @xmath80 .",
    "the switching process corresponds then to the reversal of the smm s spin _ via _ all the intermediate states .",

    "the following values of the molecule parameters are taken : @xmath93 k ( @xmath94 mev ) ,  @xcite @xmath95 mev and @xmath96 mev . since there is no clear and reliable experimental evidence of the change in anisotropy constant of the @xmath89 molecule due to extra electrons in the lumo level , we assume @xmath97",
    ". the couplings of the molecule to the left and right lead are assumed to be the same , @xmath98 mev .",
    "we also assume that both the electrodes are made of the metallic material characterized by the same polarization parameter @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "the calculations have been performed for the temperature @xmath101 k , which is below the blocking temperature @xmath102 k. the corresponding energy levels of the molecule are shown in fig.2 .",
    "it is worth noting that for the parameters assumed , the ground spin state of the molecule attached to the leads ( @xmath103 ) is the same as that of a free - standing molecule ( @xmath104 ) .",

    "this is a consequence of the left / right symmetry of the molecule s coupling to external leads  similarly to the absence of spin accumulation in tunneling through a metallic nanoparticle in the parallel magnetic configuration .",

    "[ fig3 ] ( a , c ) .",
    "the drop in current with increasing bias is equivalent to negative differential conductance ( ndc ) , see also fig .",
    "the negative differential conductance is a consequence of the spin blockade phenomenon  @xcite , which in turn follows from the inequality of the transition rates to the two levels .",

    "the negative differential conductance due to spin blockade is clearly seen , particularly in the parallel configuration for @xmath119 , although some weak negative peaks also occur in the antiparallel case .",

    "we have shown that spin polarized electrons tunneling through the lumo level of a smm can revers the smm s spin when the electrons in the lumo level interact _ via _ exchange coupling with the smm s spin .",
    "the reversal starts at a certain threshold voltage corresponding to the distance between the two lowest energy levels .",
