    "little is currently known about the detailed geometry and structure of the broad - line region ( blr ) in quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) due to the difficulty in spatially resolving the central regions even in the most nearby active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , the limited sensitivity of photo - ionization processes to the detailed blr geometry , and to the complex nature of reverberation transfer functions ( peterson 1997 ; netzer & peterson 1997 ) .",
    "for example , it is unclear whether the blr gas has a spherical or disk - like distribution , and whether the blr consists of discrete clouds or is part of a continuous gas distribution , such as an accretion disk wind [  boroson & green 1992 ( bg92 ) ; murray & chiang 1997 ] . an improved knowledge of the geometry and structure of the centrally emitting and absorbing gas regions and their relation to one another and to the continuum source(s ) may help us to better understand the observed continuum - line and line - line correlations (  bg92 ; brotherton 1996 ; wilkes  1999 ; wills  1999 ) , and furthermore shed light on the interrelation of individual agn subclasses .    the best constraints on the geometry and structure have so far been obtained from reverberation mapping ( see the excellent reviews by peterson 1993 ; netzer & peterson 1997 ) of low - luminosity agn showing ( 1 ) the blr is rather compact ( the outer radius , r@xmath3 is smaller than 0.3 pc @xmath4arcsec ) , but is geometrically thick with r@xmath5 10 r@xmath6 , ( 2 ) a certain degree of ionization stratification is present in the blr gas , and ( 3 ) the blr size and the ( bolometric ) luminosity of the active nucleus are correlated (  kaspi  2000 ) .",
    "some clues to the relative position of the continuum source , and the scattering , emitting , and absorbing components , respectively , can be obtained from polarization studies of broad - absorption line qsos (  ogle 1997 ) which argue that they are highly inclined `` radio - quiet '' qsos .",
    "additional and independent clues to the blr gas kinematics may be obtained by studying the widths of the broad emission lines themselves .",
    "the gravitational potential of the central engine is thought to dominate the kinematics of the blr gas and the line width ( fwhm ) to estimate the gravitational potential at the location of the gas , (  peterson & wandel 1999 ) .",
    "if the motion of the blr gas has a preferred direction , as opposed to disorganized virial motions around the central black hole , we would expect the projection of this velocity field on our sight line to vary as the source axis inclination varies in the agn population .    for a sample of broad - line radio sources wills & browne ( 1986 ) found fwhm(h@xmath7 ) to relate to the radio core - fraction , @xmath8 , an estimator of the radio axis inclination to our line of sight , such that face - on sources lack very broad lines .",
    "they conclude that h@xmath7  is emitted by a disk configuration perpendicular to the radio axis , which offers support to the two - component model for the high and low ionization lines ( collin - souffrin  1988 ) .",
    "the low - ionization , very high - density environment of the accretion disk fits the requirements of the physical conditions in the balmer line emitting gas .",
    "the low level of long - term variability in the broad h@xmath7  wings (  maoz   1994 ; peterson  2000 ) seems to support the disk interpretation [  corbin & smith 2000 ; but see brotherton ( 1996 ) for counter arguments ] . also , zheng ( 1992 ) and corbin ( 1997 ) model the high - velocity blr emission finding consistency with keplerian motion in low-@xmath9 sources .",
    "collin - souffrin  suggested a polar outflow origin for the high - ionization lines ( hils ) , thereby explaining their observed peak blueshift relative to the low - ionization lines ( lils ;  gaskell 1982 ; wilkes 1984 ; tytler & fan 1992 ) .",
    "however , in the absence of a definitive model a spherical distribution of dense , discrete hil - emitting clouds is often adopted in blr studies to explain trends such as the inverse correlation between [ oiii]@xmath05007 and the feii  emission ( bg92 ) .    in order to explore these possible models we studied the inclination dependence of the widths of civ@xmath01549 , representative of the hils , relative to those reported for h@xmath7  in a sample of radio - powerful qsos ( rlqs ) .",
    "we find interesting constraints applicable to the hil geometry , which we present below .",
    "this project is part of an extended study of the ultraviolet ( uv ) broad emission lines in moderate-@xmath9 qsos with a range of radio power .",
    "the details of the sample and the optical data of the extended study are described by vestergaard  ( in preparation , hereafter paper  1 ) .",
    "we summarize the main points below .",
    "the radio data are described by barthel  ( 1988 ) , lonsdale , barthel & miley ( 1993 ) and barthel , vestergaard & lonsdale ( 2000 ) .",
    "the current sample consists of 25 lobe - dominated ( ldqs ; r@xmath10 0.5 ; r@xmath11 is defined below ) and 11 core - dominated ( cdqs ; r@xmath12 0.5 ) rlqs , chosen from the larger sample of @xmath1 2 rlqs , originally selected from barthel , tytler & thomson ( 1990 ) , and the 3c and 4c catalogues . to ensure that we study the inclination dependence in the line widths , and not , say , a dependence on intrinsic source brightness",
    ", the cdqs and ldqs were selected such that their distributions of extended 5ghz radio luminosity , l@xmath13 , are similar .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test confirms this to a confidence level of 97.7% .",
    "the l@xmath13-ranges and the mean and median values also match to within the standard error , while the m@xmath14-ranges match to within the expected uncertainty of @xmath150.5@xmath16 ( table  1 ) .",
    "three of the ldqs are compact ( @xmath1715kpc ) but their @xmath18-values could be measured from our high - resolution radio images .",
    "highly variable rlqs are excluded . for the rlqs not presented by barthel  ( 1990 ) we obtained mmt blue channel spectra during 1994 october ",
    "1996 november .",
    "the rlqs were observed at airmasses below 1.4 and with a 1  slit placed at the parallactic angle .",
    "the barthel  data were not well flux - calibrated and so were recalibrated using short mmt exposures .",
    "spurious noise spikes and narrow absorption lines superposed on the emission lines were corrected by generating smooth fits to the profiles .",
    "the multiple gaussian fitting ( laor  1994 ; paper  1 ) that was applied to the civ ",
    "heii  line complex also allows a deblending of the line emission contributions , especially in the red wing of civ , which in a few objects shows signs of weak feii   emission .",
    "this is not expected to affect the current results adversely .",
    "the limitations imposed by the feii  emission will be discussed in paper  1 .",
    "the profile parameters were measured on the smooth civ  fits to ensure that they are measured consistently , objectively , and with minimum uncertainties .",
    "the full line widths at fractional profile heights , y (= 10% , 20% , ... , 90% ) were determined ( fwym ) , along with the interpercentile velocity widths , ipv(y% ) ( whittle 1985 ) .",
    "reliable error estimates of each line parameter , based on continuum and flux uncertainties , were determined in a similar fashion as outlined by whittle ( 1985 ; see paper  1 for details ) .",
    "the radio core - fraction is defined here as @xmath18 = s@xmath19/s@xmath20 , where s@xmath21@xmath15@xmath22 are the observed fluxes at 5ghz measured from our vla images ; the spectral index , @xmath23 , is defined as @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 if the former is unavailable ) . a k - correction",
    "= 50 km  s@xmath26  mpc@xmath26 , q@xmath27 = 0 is used throughout ] was applied to @xmath18 to permit a comparison in the rest - frame : @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath290 and @xmath300.8 (  kellerman & pauliny - toth 1981 ) .",
    "our definition of @xmath18 is less sensitive to variations in the density of the environment of the radio source than  the @xmath2 defined as @xmath31 , especially for face - on objects , where @xmath32 tends to be relatively weak .",
    "we also consider the inclination measure , @xmath33 , defined as the ratio of the 5ghz core flux density to the visual flux density with applied k - correction ( wills & brotherton 1995 ) .",
    "it is also less sensitive to the density of the radio source environment .",
    "fwhm(civ ) shows no relation with @xmath34 ( the confidence level p , where p is the probability of no correlation ] [ herafter cl ] of the spearman rank correlation test is @xmath1579% ) .",
    "however , fw20m(civ ) , representative of the width of the broad civ  base , shows a strong inverse correlation with @xmath34 at the 99.7% cl ( fig .",
    "[ fig1.fig]a ) .",
    "support for the reality of this effect comes from the similar relations for fw10 m , fw30 m , and fw40 m ( cls : 97.5% , 99.6% , and 98.6% ) . as an `` area parameter '' , ipv(y )",
    "is much less sensitive to the varying line - core strength which causes scatter in the fwym measures ( paper  1 ) .",
    "the fact that ipv(4070% ) show an inverse correlation with @xmath34 at the 9798% cl , also supports the reality of the fw20 m trend .",
    "the ipv(y@xmath3540% ) is more sensitive to variations in the extreme wings than fwym , evident from the larger scatter and errors .",
    "this does not jeopardize the above results for ipv(4070% ) [ paper  1 ] .",
    "the @xmath33  measure shows similar relations as @xmath34 though with relatively lower significance .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that a _ zone of avoidance _ is more evident in these relations (  figure  1b ) though it is less apparent than that presented for h@xmath7  by wills & browne ( 1986 ) .",
    "brotherton ( 1996 ) , however , finds clear anti - correlations for fw25 m and fwhm of h@xmath7  ( but none for fw75 m ) .",
    "the civ  fw20 - 30 m relations with core - dominance must primarily be driven by inclination and not some other property because : * ( 1 ) * the l@xmath13 distributions are similar for ldqs and cdqs .",
    "this is further confirmed by the at most weak fw20 - 30 m ",
    "l@xmath13 relations ( cl @xmath3695% ) , * ( 2 ) * the lack of ew correlations with core - dominance ( cls @xmath3592% ) indicates that the ( luminosity normalized ) line flux does not change with inclination , * ( 3 ) * the lack of fw70 - 90 m relations with core - dominance ( cls @xmath3537% ) shows there is no weakening of the narrow line core in ldqs which could yield an apparent but unreal fw20 - 30 m inclination dependence , and * ( 4 ) * no correlation with inclination is found for m@xmath14 , l@xmath13 , and redshift .",
    "the line width relations with inclination directly show that the high - velocity field projected along the line of sight increases with source inclination .",
    "the velocity field of blr gas ( in discrete clouds or a continuous distribution ) in organized orbits around the source axis is expected to behave this way .",
    "the similar h@xmath7  and civ  relations imply that , to first order , the kinematical structures of the two high - velocity line - emitting regions , and by inference those of hils and lils , are similar . item ( 2 ) above also implies that the line and continuum fluxes are anisotropically emitted to about the same degree .",
    "highly beamed sources are excluded and the uv continuum is also not expected to be significantly beamed (  wills & brotherton 1995 ) . item ( 2 ) confirms this .",
    "though these results do not provide independent evidence for a disk - like geometry , they are consistent with the high - velocity hil gas being physically close to the accretion disk and with its predominant motion being in a plane parallel to the disk",
    ". however , the civ  emission can not originate in the low - ionization accretion disk - material itself , while the h@xmath7  emission may (  collin - souffrin   1988 ) .",
    "we therefore propose that the high - velocity hil gas is planar and lies in close proximity to the disk , and with similar overall kinematics . in our ongoing work",
    "we will re - address this fw20 - 30 m inclination dependence issue with larger and optimally constructed l@xmath13-samples of ldqs and cdqs .",
    "our results argue against two possible blr geometries : ( i ) the velocity field of a spherical distribution of randomly orbiting clouds is not expected to vary with inclination , and ( ii ) a polar outflow of the hil gas would show the opposite inclination dependence to that seen here for civ .",
    "however , a planar hil velocity - field and geometry is consistent with a disk - wind , where the broad lines are emitted at the base of dense , optically thick winds evaporating off the accretion disk ( murray & chiang 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "this model can successfully explain a number of observational details .",
    "bottorff  ( 1997 ) and knigl & kartje ( 1994 ) present alternative disk - like blr models .    item ( 3 ) above implies that the lowest - velocity blr gas has a random velocity field relative to inclination .",
    "it may not be physically associated with the high - velocity gas located close to the accretion disk .",
    "low - density hil gas of lower optical depth at higher disk - altitudes , similar to the proposed intermediate line region ( ilr ;  brotherton  1994 ) , fits this requirement ; the altitude is low enough to maintain the high ionization level . in the murray & chiang ( 1997 ) disk - wind model",
    "the narrow line - core is emitted by the wind at much larger disk - radii than the broad line - base .",
    "this predicts similar inclination dependences for the high and low velocity fields in contrast to our results and so requires a modification of the model , possibly along the lines suggested above .",
    "brotherton ( 1996 ) finds very similar results for the inclination dependence of the high and low velocity h@xmath7  emission in a sample of rlqs .",
    "the vblr / ilr picture , which he advocates , is not geometry specific , but is fully consistent with the results and interpretations presented here .",
    "a disk - like geometry of the hil gas predicts : * ( 1 ) * other hils ( ly@xmath23 , nv , siiv+oiv ] , and heii ) should show similar dependences on source inclination ; such a study is underway , * ( 2 ) * the low - velocity dispersion ( @xmath36 2000 ^-1 kms@xmath26 ) of the narrowest line core of the hils should be independent of inclination , assuming this gas is located at relatively high disk - altitudes , and * ( 3 ) * the civ  and h@xmath7  profile parameters should behave similarly with varying source inclination , excluding the civ  narrow line core and the contribution to h@xmath7  from the narrow line region .",
    "no detailed study exists of high - redshift qsos ; the fwhms of civ  and h@xmath7   correlate somewhat at low redshift (  wilkes  1999 ) .",
    "we are currently studying this issue for low - redshift qsos , based in part on _ hubble space telescope _  archival data .",
    "despite years of study little is known for certain about the geometry of the blr of agn beyond its compact size ( @xmath36light - weeks ) .",
    "the present results indicate that the high - velocity hil gas is located in a disk - like configuration close to the accretion disk , long thought to emit the lils , and with similar kinematics .",
    "our results argue against a spherical cloud distribution with random cloud velocities and a high - ionization polar outflow .",
    "if confirmed , the implications are intriguing ; they may help to constrain interpretations of blr data and to suggest new studies to shed light on the detailed structure and kinematics of the agn blr .",
