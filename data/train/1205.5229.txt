    "<S> high resolution ultrasonic velocity measurements have been used to determine the temperature  magnetic - field phase diagram of the monoclinic multiferroic cuo . a new transition at @xmath0  k , corresponding to an intermediate state between the antiferromagnetic non - collinear spiral phase observed below @xmath1  k and the paramagnetic phase , is revealed . </S>",
    "<S> anomalies associated with a first order transition to the commensurate collinear phase are also observed at @xmath2  k. for fields with @xmath3 , a spin - flop transition is detected between 11  t - 13  t at lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our analysis using a landau - type free energy clearly reveals the necessity for an incommensurate collinear phase between the spiral and the paramagnetic phase . </S>",
    "<S> this model is also relevant to the phase diagrams of other monoclinic multiferroic systems .    </S>",
    "<S> multiferroic phenomena have been a subject of intense interest in recent decades arising from opportunities to explore new fundamental physics as well as possible technological applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> coupling between different ferroic orders has been proven to be driven by several different types of mechanisms . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> multiferroics with a spiral spin - order - induced ferroelectricity have revealed high spontaneous polarization and strong magnetoelectric coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cupric oxide ( cuo ) , the subject of this letter , was characterized as a magnetoelectric multiferroic four years ago when it was shown that its ferroelectric order is induced by the onset of a spiral antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order at an unusually high temperature of 230  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus far , two afm states have been reported , a low temperature ( @xmath4 k ) af1 commensurate collinear state with the magnetic moments along the monoclinic @xmath5 axis and an af2 incommensurate spiral state with half of the magnetic moments in the @xmath6 plane ( @xmath7 k ) @xcite . however , the authors of the neutron diffraction measurements @xcite questioned the possibility of having a direct condensation from a paramagnetic ( pm ) phase to a spiral magnetic phase . despite this remark , a recent landau theory @xcite , as well as several monte - carlo simulations @xcite , appear to support this sequence of magnetic orderings .    encouraged by recent experiments on other multiferroic systems using ultrasonic measurements @xcite , we measured the temperature and field dependence of the velocity of transverse modes in order to determine the magnetic phase diagram of cuo . </S>",
    "<S> a new transition is detected at @xmath0  k just above the af2 spiral phase observed at @xmath8  k , while the first order transition is observed at @xmath9  k. furthermore , dielectric constant measurements confirm that only the spiral phase ( between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) supports a spontaneous electric polarization . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we report on a spin - flop transition in the low temperature af1 collinear phase when @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , based on these findings , a new magnetic - field _ </S>",
    "<S> vs _ temperature phase diagram is proposed for cuo .    in order to elucidate the possible nature of the afm states observed in cuo , a non - local landau - type free energy is also developed for cuo and similar monoclinic multiferroics . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has been very successful in explaining the magnetic phase diagrams of other multiferroic systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the conclusions of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , our analysis based on rigorous symmetry arguments indicates that there must be a collinear intermediate phase ( af3 ) between the paramagnetic and spiral af2 states . </S>",
    "<S> such a phase has been shown , both theoretically and experimentally , to occur in other geometrically frustrated antiferromagnets where symmetry allows for uniaxial anisotropy at second order  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare the model predictions to the b - t phase diagram of cuo obtained using ultrasonic velocity data . similarities with other multiferroic systems such as mnwo@xmath13 , amsi@xmath14o@xmath15 , rmno@xmath16 , rmn@xmath14o@xmath17 , and ni@xmath16v@xmath14o@xmath18 </S>",

    "<S> the sample was then polished to obtain parallel faces . for velocity measurements , </S>",
    "<S> plane acoustic waves were generated using 30 mhz linbo@xmath16 piezoelectric transducers bonded to opposite faces . </S>",
    "<S> using an ultrasonic interferometer , which measures the phase shift and the amplitude of the first elastic transmitted pulse , high - resolution relative velocity variations ( @xmath24 ppm ) were achieved . </S>",
    "<S> experimental data presented here were all obtained using the velocity of transverse waves v@xmath25[@xmath26 propagating along the @xmath19 axis and polarized along @xmath21 , with the magnetic field applied along the easy magnetic axis of cuo ( @xmath5 axis ) . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneous capacitance measurements were carried out using an ah 2550a ultra precision 1khz capacitance bridge to identify which of these phases are ferroelectric . </S>",

    "<S> our high resolution velocity measurements also reveal _ two _ anomalies at @xmath1  k and @xmath31  k near the stabilization of a spiral order previously determined by neutron diffraction and susceptibility measurements @xcite , which were thought to occur at a single transition . at higher fields , the amplitude of the step like variation observed at 229.3  k , as well as the temperature difference between @xmath11 and @xmath32 increases , confirming the existence of a new intermediate magnetic order af3 . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is supported by dielectric measurements also shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> notice that , as the stability range of the intermediate phase is small ( @xmath33  k ) , velocity and dielectric data have been collected simultaneously to avoid any ambiguity regarding the actual critical temperatures . </S>",

    "<S> [ data ] ( for b = 0 and 7  t ) , the anomaly observed on the dielectric constant @xmath34 coincides very well with @xmath11 determined using velocity data , while no variation is noticeable at @xmath32 . these results also indicate that the new phase af3 is not ferroelectric , while magnetoelectric coupling exists for the af2 phase .    </S>",
