    "the study of the density of states ( dos ) in high - t@xmath3 superconducting ( sc ) metal oxides has motivated many theorists and experimentalists through the last years , because it defines such fundamental physical parameters as the quasiparticle conductivity @xmath4 , the penetration length @xmath5 , the electronic specific heat , etc .",
    "this study is guided by the facts that i ) the charge carriers are practically confined to the cuo@xmath6 planes @xcite and characterized by 2d wavevectors @xmath7 and ii ) the sc order parameter has _",
    "d_-wave symmetry @xcite with four nodal points @xmath8 , where the fermi surface crosses the nodal directions @xmath9 , the sc gap function @xmath10 turns zero , and the quasiparticle dispersion law @xmath11 coincides with that of normal metal , @xmath12 .",
    "another important factor is that the high - t@xmath3 materials are the so - called doped metals , where the fermi energy @xmath13 is defined by the density of charge carriers , introduced by the doping process @xcite .",
    "this very process creates the scattering centers for quasiparticles , due to random coulomb fields from ionized dopants .",
    "other scatterers , not related to the density of carriers , can be additionally introduced into the system , and all them can produce considerable effects on its physical properties @xcite .    in particular",
    ", some resonances can emerge in the quasiparticle spectrum with _",
    "d_-wave gap symmetry @xcite , even at low concentrations of impurities .",
    "such resonance manifests itself in a maximum of dos at a certain energy @xmath14 , as well as in logarithmic suppression of dos at @xmath15 @xcite ( the energies being referred to @xmath16 ) .",
    "these conclusions can be directly compared to experimental results , as those obtained in the scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments @xcite .",
    "the perturbation that impurities introduce into the electronic subsystem of crystal , depend either on their positions with respect to the lattice and on the potential they produce on nearest matrix sites . within the simplest possible model , where an impurity only disturbs a single site in the lattice @xcite , the potential is characterized by a single perturbation parameter .",
    "this point - like perturbation model allows one to obtain a simple solution for the quasiparticle dos in terms of their green functions , leading to the above mentioned possibility of low energy resonances .",
    "however , in reality , the impurity perturbations in high - t@xmath3 materials are not exactly point - like but rather extended to a finite number of nearest neighbor lattice sites to the impurity center .",
    "this raises an important question on how robust are the results of point - like approximation to the spatial extent and geometry of impurity perturbation .",
    "the opposite limit to the point - like perturbation , when the defect is much bigger of the fermi wavelength and can be treated quasiclassically @xcite , hardly applies to real atomic substitutes in high - t@xmath17 systems where the perturbation extends to few nearest neighbors of the impurity site .",
    "recently , an example of such extended impurity center was considered for a specific type of spin - dependent perturbation @xcite .",
    "here we use a similar approach to get comparison of the point - like and extended perturbations within the same type of perturbation operator , impossible for the above mentioned case .",
    "usually , the treatment of low energy excitations in _ d_-wave systems involves a certain parametrization of the spectrum in the vicinity of nodal points .",
    "thus , in the popular approach proposed by p. lee @xcite , one expands the difference @xmath18 in the local axes , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) , and then approximates the spectrum components as : @xmath21 with two characteristic velocities @xmath22",
    ".    however , this implies a  square  geometry of fermi surface and , strictly speaking , it only holds close enough to the half - filling condition @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the bandwidth ) . instead , in many high - t@xmath3 compounds we have @xmath25 and the geometry of fermi surface is closer to circular ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) . in this case",
    ", a more adequate parametrization of spectrum is obtained with @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 and the theta - function factor restricts sc pairing to the bcs shell of width @xmath29 ( debye energy ) around @xmath13 .",
    "most of the known treatments of impurity effects in doped and disordered @xmath30-wave sc systems , including a self - consistent t - matrix analysis of dos , were developed within point - like perturbation model and `` square '' geometry of fermi surface @xcite .",
    "the present paper is aimed to extend those studies , in order to include a more realistic features , either of the impurity perturbation ( which can affect several equivalent neighbor sites to the impurity ion ) and of the fermi surface geometry ( in a more adequate circular approximation ) .",
    "we use the nambu spinors @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the fermi operators for quasiparticles with wave vector @xmath34 and spin @xmath4 and the model hamiltonian for disordered _ d_-wave superconductor : @xmath35 in what follows we denote by hats the matrices in nambu indices , e.g. , the pauli matrices @xmath36 and the matrix @xmath37 which describes the quasiparticle scattering by extended ( attractive ) perturbation @xmath38 around an impurity center @xmath39 , over its near neighbors @xmath40 ( fig .",
