    "multi - wavelength observations of nearby edge - on disk galaxies have revealed multi - phase gaseous halos that include molecular , neutral , and warm and hot ionized phases .",
    "the extraplanar diffuse ionized gas ( edig ) layers in the milky way and other nearby edge - on disk galaxies are remarkable in that their observed scale heights generally exceed their thermal scale heights by a factor of a few ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these warm ( @xmath10 k ) , diffuse ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) layers have a range of diffuse , clumpy , and filamentary morphologies , a photoionization power requirement that is satisfied by the o and b stars in the disk , and rotational velocity profiles that suggest a probable disk origin @xcite . additionally , the detection of edig layers is positively correlated with the star formation rate per unit area for starburst , star - forming , and quiescent galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is also spatially correlated with soft x - ray emission from hot halo gas @xcite , as well as with radio continuum emission associated with extraplanar magnetic fields and cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the observation that edig layers are associated with a minimum star formation rate per unit area is consistent with models of a star - formation driven disk - halo flow .",
    "`` superbubble '' @xcite , `` galactic chimney '' @xcite , `` galactic fountain '' @xcite , and galactic wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) models all describe the local or global circulation of gas between the disk and the halo due to star formation activity in ob associations .",
    "there is observational evidence of bubbles , arcs , and filaments in the halo that are spatially associated with hii regions as well as ultraviolet continuum from young , hot stellar populations in the disk @xcite .",
    "thus , a general framework has emerged in which edig layers are found in multi - phase gaseous , magnetic field , and cosmic ray halos in galaxies with sufficient star formation rates per unit area .    within this framework ,",
    "the vertical structure , support , and dynamical state of these layers are not yet fully understood .",
    "a range of dynamical models exist to explain the column densities , scale heights , and three - dimensional kinematics of the extraplanar interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "one class of models treats extraplanar gas layers as fluid disks that satisfy the hydrostatic equilibrium equation @xcite , while another treats the layers as collections of clouds that travel ballistically through the galactic gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "some authors suggest that a combination of hydrodynamic and ballistic effects may be closest to reality ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while others seek to understand the effects of magnetohydrodynamics on the disk - halo interface in a turbulent , star - forming ism @xcite .",
    "discriminating between dynamical models for each phase of the extraplanar ism is important for undestanding how each phase is formed , evolves , and participates in the transfer of mass and energy between the disk , halo , and intergalactic environment .    here",
    ", we study the dynamical state of the edig layer in the nearby edge - on disk galaxy ngc 891 .",
    "this galaxy is an ideal candidate for this study due to its proximity ( @xmath13 mpc ; @xmath14 pc ; @xcite ) , inclination angle ( @xmath15 ; @xcite ) , and well - studied multi - phase gaseous halo .",
    "it is classified as an sb galaxy in the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies @xcite , but there is evidence at multiple wavelengths for a bar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to similarities in mass ,",
    "morphology , and bolometric luminosity , ngc 891 is often considered a milky way analog @xcite ; however , the far - infrared star formation rate is somewhat higher in the former at @xmath16 yr@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "there is evidence in the hii region number density as well as the far - infrared and radio emission morphology that the star formation rate is highest in the northeast side of the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is not evidence of a major disturbance of the stellar disk in deep optical and near - infrared photometry @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite show that the slight lopsidedness of the disk suggests a mild flyby interaction with the companion ugc 1807 .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that hi clouds with counter - rotating velocities and an hi filament near systemic velocity reaching over 20 kpc from the disk in projection towards the companion are evidence of interaction and/or accretion .",
    "this system also includes extraplanar dust @xcite , diffuse ionized gas @xcite , and hot ionized gas @xcite , as well as extraplanar magnetic fields and cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the edig in ngc 891 is among the brightest , most spatially extended , and most well - studied edig layers known .",
    "discovered in h@xmath0 narrowband imaging by @xcite and @xcite , the brightest and most vertically extended edig is found on the northeast side of the galaxy , where it appears to be spatially associated with the elevated star formation rate @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the layer has both smooth and filamentary components ; @xcite obtained high spectal resolution ( @xmath17 pc ) h@xmath0 narrowband imaging with the wfpc2 camera on the _ hubble space telescope _ that revealed a diffuse background intersected by filaments , arcs , plumes , bubbles , and supershells .",
    "notably , @xcite and @xcite detect arcs and filaments that have dimensions of tens of pc wide and several kpc long , are highly collimated to large heights above the disk , and appear to have one or both ends in star - forming regions .",
    "qualitatively , these observations suggest that star formation activity drives the warm ionized gas out of the disk by way of galactic chimneys formed from the bursting of superbubbles associated with spatially correlated supernovae @xcite .    the photoionization energy requirement of the edig layer is met by massive stars in the disk if the ism is sufficiently porous to uv photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the emission line spectrum is broadly consistent with a photoionized gas in the near - ultraviolet @xcite , optical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and infrared @xcite .",
    "however , in ngc 891 , the milky way , and other galaxies , the emission line ratios as a function of height above the disk requires a supplemental source of heating and/or ionization ; such sources may include shocks @xcite , turbulent mixing layers @xcite , hot low - mass evolved stars @xcite , and/or cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of the edig layer in ngc 891 is its considerable spatial extent above and below the midplane .",
    "the vertical electron density distribution is well - described by an exponential of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mean electron number density in the disk and @xmath20 is the electron scale height .",
    "the edig layer in ngc 891 is well - fit by a scale height of @xmath6 kpc on the northeast side of the disk @xcite .",
    "an improved fit is found if the electron density distribution is expressed as the sum of a thick disk component with @xmath21 kpc and a halo component with @xmath22 a few kpc @xcite .",
    "the thick disk and halo components may be produced by different processes ; for example , the former may be rising out of the disk via galactic chimneys and supershells , while the latter may be condensing onto the disk out of a hot halo phase @xcite .",
    "changing emission line ratios with distance from the midplane suggest that the large scale height is due to true extraplanar emission and not to hii region emission scattered by dust .",
    "additionally , @xcite use monte carlo radiative transfer simulations of h@xmath0 photon propagation through the dusty disk of ngc 891 to argue that scattered hii region emission is only 10% of edig emission at @xmath23 pc .    here , we test a dynamical equilibrium model of the edig layer in ngc 891 .",
    "although the observed scale height , lack of flaring , and general inhomogeneity of the layer suggest a system out of dynamical equilibrium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the various sources of vertical support have yet to be fully quantified for any edig layer .",
    "thus , we use optical emission line spectroscopy from the sparsepak integral field unit ( ifu ; @xcite ) on the wiyn 3.5-meter telescope at kitt peak national observatory , as well as radio continuum observations from the chang - es survey from ( * ? ? ? * in preparation ) , to determine the thermal , turbulent , magnetic field , and cosmic ray pressure gradients in the edig layer . by comparing the observed and required pressure gradients to support the edig layer at its observed scale height , we consider whether the system is best characterized by equilibrium or non - equilibrium ( i.e. , galactic fountain , galactic wind ) models .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows . in  2",
    ", we create a mass model to determine the galactic gravitational potential of ngc 891 .",
    "we give a statement of the problem and the model to be tested in  3 , and we discuss the collection and reduction of optical emission line spectroscopy using the sparsepak ifu in  4 . in ",
    "5.1 , we construct a model of the three - dimensional density distribution of the edig layer , and we constrain the velocity dispersion along the minor axis from the h@xmath0 , [ nii ] @xmath246583 , and [ sii ] @xmath246716 , 6731 emission line widths in  5.2 . in ",
    "5.3 , we determine the vertical magnetic field and cosmic ray pressure gradients in this system using radio continuum observations from the chang - es survey analyzed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in preparation ) , and in  5.4 we assess whether a magnetized edig layer in dynamical equilibrium is stable against the parker instability .",
    "we discuss our results in the context of multi - wavelength observations and our knowledge of the milky way galaxy in  6 . in  7",
    ", we conclude that a dynamical equilibrium model dominated by a magnetic pressure gradient is viable for the edig layer in ngc 891 only over a limited range of galactocentric radii ( @xmath25 kpc ) .",
    "we include an appendix to illustrate the robustness of this result against variations in the assumed mass - to - light ratio of the stellar disk .",
    "to create a mass model of ngc 891 , we use the hi rotation curve of @xcite , as well as the careful photometric deconstruction of the disk by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "use sub - arcsecond spatial resolution imaging of ngc 891 in the near - infrared , as well as radiative transfer modeling to perform a dust attenuation correction , to decompose the stellar disk into five exponential disk components : a super - thin , thin , and thick disk ( truncated within @xmath26 kpc ) , as well as a central disk and a bar ( truncated outside @xmath26 kpc ) .",
    "a super - thin disk of stars and dust was also found for this galaxy by @xcite .",
    "for the sake of computational simplicity , we reduce the five - component model of @xcite to a two - component , untruncated disk and bulge / lens model of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the baryonic mass density , @xmath29 is the central mass density , @xmath30 is the radial scale length , and @xmath20 is the vertical scale height of the disk ( d ) and bulge ( b ) .",
    "this is done by fitting the attenuation - corrected , @xmath31-band luminosity surface density of their model as functions of @xmath32 and @xmath33 to determine the radial scale lengths , vertical scale heights , and central luminosity densities of the disk and bulge .",
    "we then assign a @xmath31-band mass - to - light ratio to determine the central baryonic mass densities of each component .",
    "for the main mass model discussed in this paper ( the `` primary model '' ) , we choose a @xmath31-band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath34 , and we consider variations in @xmath35 in the appendix @xcite .",
    "to determine the parameters of the dark matter halo , we fit the hi rotation curve of @xcite using a reduced @xmath36 minimization .",
    "we assume an nfw profile of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the central dark matter density and @xmath39 is the scale radius .",
    "note that while gas is not explicitly included in our mass model , this is a @xmath40 effect on the velocity dispersion required to support the gas at a given scale height .",
    "see table 1 for the parameters of our mass model .",

    "the potential @xmath56 of the dark matter halo is given by : @xmath57 from the gravitational potential of the disk , bulge , and dark matter halo , we determine the circular velocity due to each component , and add these in quadrature to reproduce the hi rotation curve shown in figure 1 .",
    "our mass model differs from that of @xcite , most noteably in that the scale height of our disk ( @xmath58 kpc ) is only @xmath59 of theirs ( @xmath60 kpc )",
    ". as the gravitational potential within a few kpc of the disk is particularly important for the dynamical equilibrium of the edig layer , we use the new near - infrared imaging and radiative transfer modeling of @xcite to find a more conservative value of @xmath42 .",
    "throughout this study , we assume that the edig layer is in pressure balance , and we solve the hydrostatic equilibrium equation given by @xmath61 where @xmath33 and @xmath32 are the height and radial cyclindrical coordinates , respectively . here , @xmath62 is the gas density , @xmath63 is the galactic gravitational potential , and @xmath64 is the gravitational acceleration in the @xmath33 direction . the total pressure @xmath65 is the sum of the gas pressure , magnetic field pressure , and cosmic ray pressure : @xmath66 the magnetic field pressure is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "we use an equation of state of the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the quadrature sum of the one - dimensional thermal and turbulent velocity disperisons . note that here and throughout the rest of the paper , the velocity dispersion refers to the standard deviation , and not the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , of a gaussian velocity distribution .",
    "we also use `` turbulence '' to refer simply to random gas motions without assuming that they meet the strict definition of turbulence .    given a mass model of ngc 891",

    "the general solution is : @xmath69 assuming that @xmath70 is independent of @xmath33 ( see  5.2 ) , the simplified solution is : @xmath71 we define the scale height , @xmath20 , as the distance from the midplane at which the gas density has dropped by a factor of @xmath72 : @xmath73 note that this calculation temporarily neglects any magnetic field and cosmic ray pressure .",
    "we can ask what the scale height of an isothermal gas layer is for a given velocity dispersion as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "first , we concern ourselves only with the thermal velocity dispersion , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath76 is the gas temperature , @xmath77 is the mass of a proton , and @xmath0 is a scaling factor based on the composition and the ionization state . for a diffuse ionized gas with @xmath78",
    "k and @xmath79 , we find @xmath3 km s@xmath4 ( this assumes a gas that is 9% he by number , with 90% and 70% of the h and he ionized , respectively ; @xcite ) .    in figure",
    "2__a _ _ , we show the thermal scale height of an isothermal gas layer for a range of temperatures as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "two characteristics of a thermally - supported gas layer are immediately apparent .",
    "first , the layer is highly flared .",
    "second , the layer has a scale height of only a few hundred parsecs within @xmath80 kpc when @xmath78 k , a factor of a few smaller than the @xmath81 kpc observed for the edig layer in this galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the scale height only reaches @xmath81 kpc if @xmath82 k , an order of magnitude higher than the temperature of the edig layer in this system .",
    "this is further illustrated in figure 2__b _ _ , where the density distribution of the isothermal gas is shown as a function of height above the disk for a range of temperatures at a radius of @xmath9 kpc .",
    "a radius of @xmath83 kpc is chosen because this is approximately the location of the observed cutoff in h@xmath0 intensity , and thus is the shallowest location in the gravitational potential where significant h@xmath0 emission is observed ( see , e.g. , figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "a scale height of @xmath81 kpc is achieved only for a temperature of @xmath84 k ; thus , it is clear that the edig layer in ngc 891 is not thermally supported , and requires supplemental sources of pressure support if it is in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "we consider one source of additional pressure support in figure 2__c _ _ , where we now define the velocity dispersion of an isothermal gas as @xmath68 . here , for a temperature of @xmath78 k , we consider the density distribution of an isothermal gas with a range of turbulent velocity dispersions as a function of height above the disk at @xmath9 kpc .",
    "we see that a scale height of @xmath81 kpc is achieved only for a turbulent velocity dispersion of @xmath85 km s@xmath4 , or turbulence with a sonic mach number of 3 to 4 in a @xmath78 k gas .",
    "thus , observationally constraining the velocity dispersion in the edig layer of ngc 891 is a major goal of this work .",

    "cosmic ray removal was accomplished through image stacking where possible , and through the package l.a.cosmic on individual images where necessary @xcite . `",
    "dohydra ` was used to trace and extract the spectra , as well perform the flat field correction and find the dispersion solution .",
    "observations of a thar comparison lamp were used to solve for the dispersion solution as well as the spectral resolution ; these observations were obtained before and after each set of object exposures .",
    "sky subtraction was performed using a median stacking of the sky spectra in each pointing in which no edig emission was detected . in deeper spectra ,",
    "@xcite detect edig emission at the location of our sky spectra , and we therefore compared our stacked sky spectra to that of @xcite to look for such contamination .",
    "the sky spectra for p1 , p2 , and p4 ( see table 2 ) showed no evidence of edig emission , but the spectrum for p3 showed a weak h@xmath0 emission line ( @xmath99 erg @xmath100 s@xmath4 ) that was fit and removed using a single gaussian profile before sky subtraction was performed .",
    "flux calibration was then performed using observations of the standard stars pg0205 + 134 and feige 110 .",
    "since the sky and standard stars were observed only with certain fibers , sky flats were used to perform a fiber - to - fiber throughput correction to improve the quality of sky subtraction and flux calibration .",
    "the data reduction presented an additional challenge due to a large amount of instrumental scattered light in the data .",
    "after observations were concluded , it was determined that improper closure of the ccd head electronics box after servicing resulted in light leaking onto the ccd from exposed leds .",
    "this resulted in a gradient of excess counts over the entire ccd that increases to the blue , as well as a discrete feature primarily affecting fibers 8 - 18 near the [ nii ] @xmath246583 emission line .",
    "the excess counts per ( unextracted ) pixel range from a few percent to @xmath101 of the continuum counts per pixel in the gradient , and are as high as @xmath102 of the continuum counts per pixel in the discrete feature .",
    "the counts are present in all science and calibration frames , although the magnitude and morphology of the counts varies somewhat from night to night .",
    "a scattered light correction was performed using the ` apscatter ` task in iraf .",
    "the scattered light between the spectra was identified , a model of the excess counts over the ccd was constructed , and these counts were subtracted to produce a cleaned version of the data .",
    "specifically , a very high order function ( 60th - 100th order spline ) was fit to the scattered light along and across the dispersion .",
    "a high order function was required to fit the structure in the discrete features ; however , a lower order function was desired to fit the general gradient .",
    "thus , a lower order function ( 5th order spline ) was fit across the dispersion of the higher order fit to characterize the gradient .",
    "this latter fit was subtracted from the former to isolate the discrete features , which were then subtracted from the data , leaving only the smooth gradient to be removed . finally , the gradient was fit and subtracted using 45th and 5th - 8th order splines along and across the dispersion , respectively .",
    "some residual evidence of the scattered light is apparent in several fibers .",
    "this evidence is largely manifested as artificial structure in the continuum around the [ nii ] @xmath246583 emission line .",
    "the fibers that were rejected from the analysis due to the residual effects of scattered light are marked as such in figure 3 .",
    "the poisson ( random ) error was calculated for the raw data and calibration frames , and propagated through the data reduction and analysis .",
    "the poisson error is generally comparable to the rms error in the continuum near the emission lines of interest .",
    "however , the scatter in a given continuum - subtracted , emission - line masked spectrum does not have a strictly gaussian distribution ; instead , a 3@xmath70 poisson error generally corresponds to a @xmath103 confidence interval .",
    "thus , we define our edig detection criteria as follows : to have a detection , a fiber must have one or more emission lines with at least a 5@xmath70 detection , or two or more emission lines with at least a 4@xmath70 detection .",

    "some example spectra are shown at a range of @xmath33 values for both the minor axis and off - axis pointings in figure 4 . in the disk ( @xmath106 kpc ) , the spectra are consistent with hii region emission ( [ nii]@xmath107/h@xmath108 ) , while by @xmath109 kpc the spectra are characteristic of diffuse emission ( [ nii]@xmath107/h@xmath110 ) . while the line profiles on the minor axis are fairly symmetric , rotational broadening results in line profiles off - axis that are clearly asymmetric .",
    "there is also evidence of line splitting due to multiple velocity components along the line of sight ( e.g. , for @xmath97 kpc , @xmath111 kpc ) .    to characterize the emission line properties further",

    "we see from equation ( 9 ) that if these quantities are independent of @xmath33 , then an exponential profile with a constant scale height is a good representation of the density distribution .",
    "we also tested a distribution of the form @xmath160 , but the quality of the fit was not improved .",
    "we re - express the @xmath134 intensity as follows , assuming that the temperature , filling factor , and pathlength through the edig layer are independent of @xmath33 ( @xmath161 ) : @xmath162 from equation ( 13 ) , we model @xmath119 for a range of @xmath163 and @xmath20 values , and compare to the observed @xmath119 using a @xmath36 minimization approach ( i.e. , minimizing the value of the reduced @xmath36 defined by @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "a comparison of modeled and observed @xmath119 values was made at every @xmath98 and @xmath33 value where the edig was detected .",

    "the observed @xmath119 values are given in online table 3 .",
    "we consider both a single - component ( thick disk ) model as well as a two - component ( thick disk and halo ) model .",
    "the two components are distinguished by different scale heights as well as different electron densities in the midplane .",
    "@xcite identifies a thick disk and a halo component in long - slit spectroscopy of this system at @xmath166 kpc ; while we detect the edig to a height of @xmath167 kpc above the midplane , he detects the edig to the remarkable height of @xmath168 kpc , and is thus better able to characterize the halo properties .",
    "therefore , we use his parameterization of the halo in our two - component model ( see table 4 ) , and perform the @xmath169 minimization to parameterize the thick disk in both our single- and multi - component models .",
    "we exclude all observations at @xmath170 kpc to reduce the effects of dust extinction and hii region contamination .",
    "recently , the remarkable vertical extent of extraplanar dust in ngc 891 has become clear ; in addition to a dust disk with a scale height of @xmath171 kpc @xcite , there is a dust halo with a scale height determined by @xcite to be @xmath172 kpc , and by @xcite to be @xmath173 kpc . as the edig layer and the dust halo have comparable scale heights , dust extinction of the edig layer must be considered .",

    "the two - component fit improves the @xmath169 value only negligibly compared to the one - component fit .",
    "the addition of a radial scale length to the electron density distribution given in equation ( 13 ) does not improve the quality of the fit in a @xmath169 sense .",
    "however , we consider one variation on the radial density distribution - a ring model in which the edig is excluded from the inner part of the galaxy at @xmath149 .",
    "we evaluate the @xmath169 values of our two - component model with @xmath185 kpc .",
    "an improvement in @xmath169 is seen for both the east and west sides ; minimum @xmath169 values of 16.6 and 29.8 are found for @xmath186 kpc for the east and west sides , respectively .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath187 and @xmath20 remain within @xmath188 of those given in table 4 .",
    "although this evidence is in favor of a ring model , we can not robustly constrain @xmath112 using this method or previous considerations of the line profiles and pv diagram .",

    "additionally , the smaller scale height of the thick disk in the two - component model makes the dynamical equilibrium model easier to satisfy than in the one - component model . for the purposes of this paper , we focus on the dynamical state of the thick disk , for which scale heights of @xmath182 kpc and @xmath183 kpc were found for the east and west sides of the disk , respectively .",
    "we take the average of these two values , @xmath6 kpc , as well as the average of the electron density in the disk , @xmath189 @xmath190 , as the edig density distribution that we seek to satisfy with our dynamical equilibrium model for the remainder of this paper .",

    "we can not robustly quantify the fourth term , which is due to bulk motions that deviate from our simple assumptions about the geometry and rotation of the edig layer .",
    "thus , we combine the second and fourth terms into a single @xmath198 term that is understood to represent an upper limit on the turbulent velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "we assume that the turbulent motions in the gas are isotropic such that @xmath202 .",

    "although ideally we would only measure line widths for fibers that fall strictly along the minor axis , the difficulty of precisely aligning the fiber array with the true rotation axis necessitates the use of all fibers in the minor axis pointings . for each fiber , we select all emission lines that are detected at the 4@xmath70 level or greater ( [ nii ] @xmath246548 is excluded due to its weak intensity ) . the line widths and uncertainties are determined by fitting a gaussian to the line profile using the idl function ` mpfitfun ` as described in  4.3 .",
    "these line widths are then corrected for instrumental and thermal broadening , and a single , non - thermal line width is determined by taking a median of the individual line widths .",

    ", we must make an assumption about the geometry of the edig layer .",
    "although we favor the ring model over the disk model presented in  5.1.1 , we consider both models here due to our inability to definitively determine the geometry of the layer . in this way",

    "the stability criterion for a horizontally magnetized plasma layer modified to include cosmic rays is given by : @xmath243 where @xmath244 and @xmath245 refer to the adiabatic index of the thermal gas and the cosmic rays , respectively @xcite .",
    "we evaluate whether the @xmath244 value required for stability is reasonable for two choices of @xmath245 .",
    "although @xcite argue that values as large as @xmath246 are appropriate for the turbulent , star - forming ism , we choose the more conservative value of @xmath247 for the edig @xcite .",
    "our choice of a plane - parallel magnetic field geometry is an over - simplification , but has the advantage that the stability analysis is exactly solvable .",
    "@xcite show similar results for more complicated , curved configurations .",
    "if the cosmic rays are coupled to the system via scattering ( @xmath248 for our choice of @xmath249 ; @xcite ) , they contribute to stabilizing the layer for the motions parallel to the ambient magnetic field characteristic of the parker instability . in figure 12 ,",
    "the minimum @xmath244 required for stability is shown as the dashed curves for a range of galactocentric radii , the magnetic field parameters of @xcite ( see  5.3 ) , and no gas clumping ( @xmath227 ) .",
    "if instead the cosmic rays are not coupled to the system and simply diffuse along field lines ( @xmath250 ) , then they have the effect of destabilizing the layer .",
    "the minimum @xmath244 required for stability is again shown as the solid curves in figure 12 .",
    "for both the equipartition and non - equipartition cases , the stability criterion is only satisfied if @xmath251 , and even then only at @xmath7 kpc .    in figure 11",
    ", we indicate the regions of parameter space where the dynamical equilibrium model is unstable at @xmath237 for @xmath251 . in these cases ,",
    "stability can be achieved by moving the gas to @xmath252 .",
    "thus , our dynamical equilibrium model is stable only if the cosmic rays are well - coupled to the system , and , in some parts of parameter space , the minimum galactocentric radius required for stability is greater than that required for dynamical equilibrium .",
    "we tested a dynamical equilibrium model for the bright , vertically extended edig layer in ngc 891 . using optical emission line spectroscopy , we constrained the three - dimensional density distribution of the edig layer , and found exponential electron scale heights of @xmath182 kpc and @xmath253 kpc on the east and west sides of the disk , respectively .",
    "we argue that the symmetry of the emission line profiles , the location of the velocity centroids in position - velocity space , and the comparable h@xmath0 intensities on and off of the minor axis all suggest that the edig is preferentially found in a ring at moderate galactocentric radius ( @xmath151 kpc , @xmath2 kpc ) .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with a picture in which the edig is found in discrete clouds and filaments above star - forming spiral arms where galactic chimneys and superbubbles can break out of the disk .",
    "the small volume filling factor suggested by this picture , as well as the likelihood of non - circular motions along the line of sight , are in qualitative agreement with the scatter observed in both the emission line widths and intensities .    from a mass model of ngc 891",
    ", we found that a velocity dispersion of @xmath254 km  s@xmath4is required to support the layer in dynamical equilibrium between @xmath255 kpc . in the mid - disk , this is at least a factor of a few larger than the thermal velocity dispersion of a @xmath78 k gas ( @xmath3 km  s@xmath4 ) , and is also larger than the turbulent velocity dispersion along the minor axis ( @xmath5 km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , we find that the edig layer in this galaxy is not supported by thermal and turbulent pressure gradients at any galactocentric radius .    using radio continuum observations from the chang - es survey ( * ?",
    "* in preparation ) , we demonstrate that the edig layer can be supported by magnetic field and cosmic ray pressure gradients only at galactocentric radii of @xmath7 kpc for the magnetic field parameters of @xcite and an edig filling factor of @xmath227 . as",
    "this radius is comparable to the maximum radius at which the edig is observed , this model is only viable if the edig is found in a very thin ring at @xmath9 kpc .",
    "we also explore variations in the edig filling factor , magnetic field strength , and magnetic field scale height that suggest that a large filling factor ( @xmath256 ) and a strong magnetic field ( @xmath257 g ) are required for the model to be viable over a larger range of radii ( @xmath258 ) kpc .",
    "a model in which the edig is found in a ring is qualitatively consistent with a picture in which the gas is found primarily over star - forming spiral arms .",
    "co observations give some clues as to the nature of the spiral structure in this galaxy .",
    "@xcite argue for a spiral structure similar to that in the milky way galaxy : a compact nucleus , a bar with radius @xmath259 kpc , a ring at @xmath260 kpc , and additional intensity peaks suggestive of spiral arms beyond the ring .",
    "it is also possible that the ring at @xmath261 kpc may be a spiral arm viewed in projection @xcite .",
    "given emission line spectroscopy with higher s / n and higher spectral resolution , a stronger constraint on @xmath112 could be found for the edig layer , and thus the geometry of the edig layer and the spiral structure could be more closely compared .",
    "there is almost certainly edig found within @xmath262 , but this gas is likely to remain close to the disk due to the kinematics of the bar and the depth of the potential well , and thus would be obscured by the dust lane and hii region emission in our observations .",
    "the success of the dynamical equilibrium model depends on our assumptions about the vertical and radial distribution of the edig layer .",
    "our assumption of a symmetric density distribution , though necessary , is certainly a simplification .",
    "additionally , a single - component fit to the h@xmath0 intensity produces a larger thick disk scale height than a two - component fit , making the model more difficult to satisfy for the thick disk at a given value of @xmath32 .",
    "if the gas is found beyond @xmath114 kpc , as is argued by @xcite , then our best - fit electron scale height decreases ; for instance , if @xmath113 increases by @xmath263 , then @xmath20 decreases by @xmath264 . similarly , if the gas is not found within a large @xmath112 , and the pathlength through the gas decreases by a factor of a few , then the electron density , @xmath163 , increases by the same factor .",
    "if the pathlength through the gas decreases by an order of magnitude , then the dynamical equilibrium model is only satisfied at @xmath265 kpc for the parts of parameter space considered in figure 11 .",
    "thus , more robustly constraining @xmath113 through deep spectroscopic observations at @xmath266 kpc , as well as @xmath112 and @xmath113 by looking for characteristic radial distributions of edig in face - on disk galaxies , is important for future studies of the dynamical state of the edig layers in these systems .",
    "there are other phenomena that could affect the dynamical equilibrium of the edig layer .",
    "first , it is possible that radiation pressure is a supplemental source of vertical support not considered here .",
    "a full treatment of radiation pressure in the edig layer would require knowledge of the radiation field and the gas - to - dust ratio in the layer @xcite .",
    "second , any deviations from the simple , plane - parallel magnetic field geometry considered here require the magnetic tension force to be taken into account . @xcite",
    "unsuccessfully attempted to reproduce an edig scale height of @xmath81 kpc using magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a turbulent , star - forming gas layer .",
    "their simulations failed to produce sufficient magnetic support for the gas layer due to the canceling of the magnetic pressure by the magnetic tension force .",
    "however , it is unclear whether this is simply a result of their periodic boundary conditions for the magnetic field .",
    "it is important that we consider the edig layer in ngc 891 as one phase of a multi - phase gaseous halo .",
    "studies of larger samples of galaxies have shown correlations in the morphologies and luminosities at radio continuum , far - infrared , h@xmath0 , ultraviolet , and soft x - ray wavelengths @xcite .",
    "as multiple phases are produced by the same star formation feedback processes , it is likely that these phases are not only co - produced but also co - evolve over time .",
    "the hot phase is of particular interest for edig layers , as extended soft x - ray emission is spatially correlated with h@xmath0 emission , suggesting that the warm phase may exist as cool clouds , clumps , and filaments embedded in a hotter phase @xcite . @xcite detect an extended soft x - ray halo in ngc 891 that shares broad morphological similarities with the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "while the large scale height of the hot halo ( @xmath267 kpc ) suggests that the pressure gradient in this medium is too small to affect the dynamical equilibrium of the edig , the presence of the hot halo may influence the cloud - cloud velocity dispersion , equilibrium pressure , and lifetime of edig clumps and filaments .",
    "in particular , line widths consistent with a sonic mach number of @xmath212 in the warm phase are consistent with subsonic turbulence in the hot phase , suggesting that the quantity we are measuring is a cloud - cloud velocity dispersion of warm clumps embedded in a hot halo .",
    "* in preparation ) suggests that there is evidence for cosmic ray advection by a galactic wind with advection speeds of a few hundred km  s@xmath4 in the spectral index profile as a function of height above the disk .",
    "particularly , by solving the cosmic ray transport equation , they argue that advective cosmic ray transport produces a spectral index profile more consistent with observations than diffusive transport .",
    "if there is indeed a galactic outflow of the hot ionized medium , and the warm and hot phases are co - spatial , then there are implications for the dynamical equilibrium of the edig . both ram pressure associated with an outflow and magnetic tension associated with a field that is anchored in the warm phase but advected in the hot may be additional sources of support . though a quantitative consideration of this model is beyond the scope of this paper , the relationship between edig layers and galactic outflows is of interest for further study .",
    "@xcite show the pervasive presence of neutral gas in ngc 891 ; nearly @xmath268 of the hi mass is found in a halo with a scale height of @xmath269 kpc between the radii of interest ( @xmath211 kpc ) .",
    "the neutral phase may affect the dynamical equilibrium of the ionized phase in several ways .",
    "first , it increases the power requirement of the edig by increasing the energy dissipation via shocks from cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "second , if both the neutral and ionized gas are supported in dynamical equilibrium by magnetic field and cosmic ray pressure , then the magnetic field and cosmic ray pressure gradients would need to be steeper than required here to simultaneously support both phases .",
    "additionally , satisfying the stability requirement considered in  5.4 is more difficult in the neutral phase ; due to ion - neutral damping of the alfvn waves generated by the streaming instability @xcite , the cosmic rays are not well - coupled to the gas in the cold phase , and their effective adiabatic index is lower than in the warm phase ( @xmath250 ) .",
    "the dynamical state of the neutral gas in ngc 891 is further complicated by extraplanar gas close to the systemic velocity or counter - rotating that is suggestive of interaction and/or accretion @xcite .",
    "thus , the impact of the neutral gas on the dynamical state of the ionized gas is a nuanced question that can not be fully addressed here . a model that simultaneously considers the dynamical state of the cold , warm , and hot phases in this galaxy is of interest for future work .",
    "ngc 891 and the milky way galaxy are often considered `` twin '' galaxies due to similarities in structure and bolometric luminosity @xcite .",
    "as our internal vantage point presents challenges for studying the edig layer in our own galaxy ( the `` reynolds layer '' ; @xcite ) , it is interesting to consider what insights are gained by comparing the edig layers in these systems . in the galaxy , the warm , ionized medium ( wim ) is observed along almost all lines of sight in the wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( wham ) survey @xcite , which has mapped the northern sky @xcite and is currently concluding mapping the southern @xcite . with a one - degree beam ,",
    "wham has observed a complex wim morphology of clumps and filaments superimposed on a diffuse background .",
    "the physical conditions in the wim are similar to those in the edig of ngc 891 , with a temperature @xmath270 k , an average electron density @xmath271 @xmath12 , an ionization fraction @xmath272 for @xmath78 k @xcite , and a filling fraction @xmath273 in the disk that increases to @xmath274 by @xmath109 kpc @xcite .",
    "the remarkable feature that the exponential electron scale height greatly exceeds the thermal scale height is observed in both ngc 891 and in the galaxy . a study of the h@xmath0 intensity as a function of galactic latitude above the perseus spiral arm suggests an exponential electron scale height of @xmath275 kpc @xcite . in velocity space , the wim broadly traces the kinematics of nearby spiral arms , suggesting that the wim may be spatially associated with regions of star - formation activity .",
    "towards large galactic latitudes , the wim is preferentially blueshifted , although it is unclear whether this is indicative of a local feature or of a global bulk flow @xcite .",
    "thus , the dynamical state of the reynolds layer is in question , and here we consider a dynamical equilibrium model for this layer by qualitatively comparing what is known about the thermal , turbulent , magnetic field , and cosmic ray pressure gradients in ngc 891 and in the galaxy .",
    "an h@xmath0 line width of @xmath276 km  s@xmath4fwhm is observed toward the north galactic pole ( l. m. haffner , private communication ) .",
    "as this is comparable to the thermal line width , this single , pencil - beam measurement suggests that the scale height problem may be even more severe in the galaxy than in ngc 891 .",
    "the non - thermal velocity dispersion of the wim has also been measured by using the difference in mass between h and s to separate the thermal and non - thermal components of the h@xmath0 and [ sii ] @xmath246716 emission lines @xcite .",
    "the s line widths mainly range from @xmath277 km  s@xmath4fwhm , suggesting @xmath278 km  s@xmath4for the wim .",
    "these velocities are likely a combination of an intercloud and a cloud - cloud velocity dispersion .",
    "these results are consistent with ( magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of turbulence in the wim .",
    "the spatial gradient of linearly polarized emission is consistent with subsonic or transonic turbulence @xcite , the electron density power spectrum suggests transonic turbulence @xcite , and the emission measure distribution function yields slightly supersonic mach numbers of @xmath279 @xcite .",
    "therefore , available evidence suggests that neither the edig layer in ngc 891 nor in the galaxy are supported by a thermal or turbulent pressure gradient .",
    "in the galaxy , the synchrotron halo implies extraplanar magnetic field properties generally consistent with those of external quiescent galaxies . in the solar neighborhood ,",
    "the magnetic field strength is @xmath280 g @xcite , and the magnetic field scale height is @xmath281 kpc or larger from equipartition arguments @xcite .",
    "optical polarization of starlight suggests that the magnetic field lines are largely parallel to the midplane and follow the structure of the nearest spiral arm in the disk @xcite .",
    "the field also shows evidence of the extraplanar x - shaped morphology observed in other edge - on galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , the broad similarities between the magnetic field strength , scale height , and morphology in ngc 891 and in the galaxy suggest that magnetic field and cosmic ray pressure gradients may play an important role in the vertical structure and support of the reynolds layer .",
    "a full quantitative comparison of the edig layers in these galaxies is beyond the scope of this paper , and requires considerations that range from the star formation rate to the accretion and interaction history of each galaxy .",
    "there are also clear differences between the warm , ionized phases in these systems ; compared to the galaxy , the edig layer in ngc 891 has a greater vertical extent , twice the surface density , and a higher ratio of ionized to neutral gas , possibly due to the higher star formation rate in the latter system @xcite .",
    "however , the success of the dynamical equilibrium model for ngc 891 warrants the exploration of such a model for the galaxy given the broad similarities in the extraplanar gas and magnetic field properties of these galaxies .",
    "we sought to determine the dynamical state of the edig layer in ngc 891 .",
    "this layer is remarkable due to an observed scale height that exceeds its thermal scale height by a factor of a few . specifically , we tested a dynamical equilibrium model by quantifying the thermal , turbulent , magnetic field , and cosmic ray pressure gradients in this galaxy .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    1 .",
    "we obtained optical emission line spectroscopy of the edig layer using the sparsepak ifu on the wiyn telescope .",
    "we probed a wide range in height above and below the disk ( @xmath282 kpc ) and in projected radius ( @xmath283 kpc ) with moderate spectral resolution ( @xmath284 km  s@xmath4at h@xmath0 ) .",
    "we found a thick disk exponential electron scale height of @xmath182 kpc and @xmath183 kpc on the east and west sides of the galaxy , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with past measurements in the literature .",
    "2 .   several pieces of evidence point to the edig being found preferentially at moderate galactocentric radius ( @xmath285 kpc , where @xmath2 kpc ) .",
    "these include the comparable @xmath286 on and off of the minor axis , the lack of low- and high - velocity emission line wings , and the location of the observed velocity centroids in position - velocity space .",
    "we measured the h@xmath0 , [ nii ] @xmath246583 , and [ sii ] @xmath246716 , 6731 emission line widths along the minor axis , and show that they are consistent with a turbulent medium with a sonic mach number of @xmath287 .",
    "the thermal ( @xmath3 km  s@xmath4 ) and turbulent ( @xmath288 km  s@xmath4 ) velocity dispersions are far below that required to support the edig layer by thermal and turbulent pressure gradients between @xmath289 and the observed cutoff at @xmath9 kpc ( @xmath290 km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the observed turbulent velocity dispersion is supersonic for the warm phase , but is subsonic for the hot halo ; this is consistent with the edig being a collection of cool clouds embedded in a hot , potentially outflowing phase .",
    "we referred to an analysis by ( * ? ? ? * in preparation ) of the synchrotron halo in ngc 891 using chang - es radio continuum observations to determine the magnetic field and cosmic ray pressure gradients in this system .",
    "the combined thermal , turbulent , magnetic field , and cosmic ray pressure gradients are sufficient to support the edig layer at a scale height of @xmath81 kpc at galactocentric radii of @xmath7 kpc .",
    "the uncertainty on the edig filling factor , magnetic field strength , and magnetic scale height yield an uncertainty of a few kpc on this galactocentric radius , and thus it is possible that the edig is supported in dynamical equilibrium in a thin ring between @xmath211 kpc .",
    "5 .   our dynamical equilibrium model of a magnetized edig layer",
    "is parker stable if the cosmic rays are sufficiently coupled to the system ( @xmath251 )",
    "similarities between the thermal and turbulent properties of the warm ionized gas as well as the synchrotron halos in ngc 891 and the milky way galaxy suggest that extraplanar magnetic fields and cosmic rays may play an important role in the dynamical state of the reynolds layer .",
    "7 .   in future work , a simultaneous treatment of the extraplanar cold , warm , and hot gas is desired to understand the dynamical state of the multi - phase gaseous halo .    studying the edig layers of nearby edge - on disk galaxies",
    "has both advantages and disadvantages .",
    "we are able to directly determine the vertical scale height of the layer and quantify the gas , magnetic field , and cosmic ray pressure as functions of height above the disk .",
    "however , we can not directly measure the vertical velocity dispersion or look for evidence of vertical inflow , outflow , or other non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "we also can not definitively determine the location of the gas along the line of sight , or search for spatial correlations between the properties of the halo gas and the underlying disk .",
    "thus , fully characterizing the dynamical state of edig layers requires observations of disk galaxies with a range of inclination angles .",
    "future work will focus on face - on disk galaxies at high spectral resolution to directly measure the vertial velocity dispersion and any vertical bulk flows , determine the radial distribution of the gas , explore connections between the gaseous halo , the underlying stellar disk , and the intergalactic environment , and assess the generality of the model presented here ( boettcher , gallagher , zweibel , & benjamin , in preparation ) .",
