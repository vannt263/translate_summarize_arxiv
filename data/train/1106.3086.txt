    "the cdf collaboration recently reported the measurement of a large forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath3 ) in top pair production with 5  fb@xmath4 of data in both semi - leptonic  @xcite and dileptonic  @xcite channels .",
    "the observed asymmetry , for @xmath5 gev deviates from the standard model by more than 3@xmath6 .",
    "the new cdf results are consistent with earlier observation of large top asymmetries by both cdf and d0 based on smaller data sets @xcite , and moreover the significance of the discrepancy has grown over time .",
    "constraints from other measurements , such as the total @xmath7 cross section and the dijet bound , make model building curiously difficult .",
    "there have been basically two classes of models proposed to explain the top quark anomaly , @xmath8-channel and @xmath0-channel models , both of which must have non - universal flavor structure .",
    "the first class of models provide a tree - level contribution to @xmath7 through the exchange of a new particle in the @xmath8-channel",
    ". this contribution can not be too large without affecting the overall @xmath7 rate , so the new particle should be heavy ( @xmath9 1 tev ) .",
    "even then , one expects the cross section to grow as a function of the @xmath7 invariant mass , which is not seen .",
    "the contribution to @xmath3 can be enhanced by making the new particle colored and parity - violating , which leads to axigluon models  @xcite .",
    "however , to get the right @xmath3 contribution , the axigluon has to have unusual opposite sign couplings to @xmath10 and @xmath7",
    ". moreover , dijet bound constraints force these models to couple more weakly to ups than tops  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-channel models can explain @xmath3 if some new particle has @xmath11 couplings to up and top  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-channel models are not constrained by the dijet data , but there are constraints from the total @xmath7 rate , as well as same - sign tops at the tevatron , and single top production . in these models , the large flavor - violating @xmath1 coupling appears initially to be ad - hoc and unnatural .    in order to make @xmath0-channel models more appealing theoretically , there have been attempts to embed them in flavor - conserving models by introducing new horizontal symmetries @xcite . in the existing models ,",
    "the top asymmetry anomaly is explained by new physics uncorrelated to the profound puzzle of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) which necessitates new physics interpretation on its own .",
    "the models would be much more compelling if the @xmath3 anomaly corresponded to a previously existing mechanism of ewsb . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that there is indeed such a possibility in the framework of top condensation @xcite .",
    "top condensation models can provide particles which naturally have large top - up couplings , and can be exchanged in the @xmath0-channel to produce the observed @xmath3 .    in top condensation ,",
    "electroweak symmetry is dynamically broken , as in technicolor ( and in qcd ) , through the formation of bound states .",
    "the difference from technicolor is that the condensate is made up of the top quark itself , rather than new techniquarks .",
    "a realistic and viable framework for top condensation is topcolor assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) @xcite . in this framework , there are two sources of ewsb , or three if qcd is included .",
    "the majority of ewsb and the majority of the the @xmath12 and @xmath13 masses are due to technicolor , with a small contribution from topcolor ; the majority of the top quark mass comes from the topcolor condensate .",
    "the light quarks can get mass from the extended technicolor or a scalar higgs . in this way",
    ", tc2 solves one of the difficulties of technicolor , namely how to explain large top yukawa without flavor problem .",
    "we will review the tc2 setup in section  [ sec : tc2 ] .",
    "one generic consequence of having two sources of electroweak symmetry breaking is that there are two sets of goldstone bosons .",
    "one set is eaten by the @xmath12 and @xmath13 to give them their masses , the other set are an @xmath14 triplet of top - pions .",
    "these top - pions are similar to the charged higgses and pseudoscalar in two - higgs doublet models , but couple only to the third generation , at leading order .",
    "topcolor also generically has a top - higgs , which is the scalar @xmath7 bound state .",
    "in addition , there should be angular and radial excitations .",
    "the lightest of these , in analogy to qcd , is expected to be a vector , the top - rho . in the unbroken phase , all of these particles couple predominantly to @xmath7 , where here @xmath0 is the top - color eigenstate .",
    "after electroweak symmetry , the right - handed top can have large mixing with the right - handed charm and up - quarks . that only the right - handed top quark has large mixing is a consequence of having only a @xmath7 condensate , not @xmath15 , which is in turn a consequence of top - hypercharge being attractive in the @xmath7 channel but repulsive in @xmath15 .",
    "while there are strong constraints on left - handed mixing , there is substantial freedom in mixing @xmath16 without violating flavor bounds , an appealing natural feature of this model .",
    "if there is substantial mixing between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , there will be large flavor changing @xmath1 couplings in the mass basis .",
    "thus the top - pions , top - higgs , and top - rho can all contribute to @xmath7 production , with exactly the desired features of the @xmath0-channel models to explain @xmath3 .",
    "one critical feature for the viability of this model is the large interference effects among the new physics particles , and between the new physics and the standard model .",
    "the interference between the top - mesons and the standard model in @xmath7 production is destructive , making it possible to be consistent with the measured total @xmath7 cross section and at the same time maintain a large enough @xmath3 .",
    "large @xmath1 couplings generically predict the production of abundant same - sign top quarks .",
    "this is also true in our model .",
    "however , due to destructive interference between the top - higgs and the top - pion , as well as that between the top - higgs and the top - rho , there exists large parameter space within current experimental bounds .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : tc2 ] with a review of the tc2 setup .",
    "this review is based on the hill and simmons technicolor review  @xcite , with a slightly different emphasis and a few more relevant details . the relevant low energy theory after mixing is expanded in section  [ sec : eft ] . in section  [ sec : pheno ] , we isolate the important relevant couplings in the low energy theory and discuss their phenomenological implications . in particular , we discuss @xmath3 in section  [ sec : afb ] , the @xmath7 rate in section  [ sec : ttbar ] and the same - sign top rate in section  [ sec : tt ] .",
    "the bounds are combined in section  [ sec : comb ] .",
    "section  [ sec : more ] discusses additional constraints and signatures .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] presents our conclusions .",
    "in top condensation , the condensate which breaks electroweak symmetry is made up of the top quark itself , rather than new techniquarks as in technicolor . for this to work ,",
    "the top quark must not be confined in the condensate .",
    "such behavior is different from qcd , but not unreasonable .",
    "indeed , exactly such a situation happens in a non - relativistic situation with the formation of cooper pairs and breaking of @xmath18 in the bcs theory of superconductivity .",
    "the behavior is consistent with calculations in the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , although these calculations are very approximate .",
    "realistic natural models of topcolor can only provide around @xmath19 gev of the ewsb vev @xmath20  gev , so they must be supplemented by another ewsb sector , leading to topcolor - assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) .",
    "in section  [ sec : overview ] we give an overview of top - condensation .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] specifies to tc2 .",
    "the low energy effective theory of tc2 including the relevant mixing is discussed in section  [ sec : eft ] .",
    "top condensation is based on the observation that strong interactions among fermions , such as with a 4-fermi operator with large coefficient , can lead to bound states .",
    "these bound states can pick up a negative mass squared through rg evolution leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "top condensation observes that the top quark is already expected to have strong interactions , since its yukawa coupling , @xmath21 , so it is natural to have strong dynamics associated with the third generation alone . in the njl model , where one includes only a single dimension 6 operator and only fermion loops , the qualitative features of top - condensation can be shown to be reasonable . in this way",
    "the proximity of the top mass to the electroweak vev is required , and explained , in contrast to in technicolor theories , where the large top mass is extremely challenging to explain .",
    "the typical picture in top condensation is that the top first forms a bound state , @xmath22 at a scale @xmath23 . in topcolor models ,",
    "the scale @xmath23 is associated with a new force , topcolor , which acts on the third generation quarks .",
    "if topcolor is strong , and itself higgsed so that the topcolor gauge bosons are massive , then the leading operator generated by integrating out the topcolor gauge bosons is @xmath24 where the top - higgs , @xmath25 has been integrated - in in the last step and @xmath26 at the scale @xmath27 . at this point , @xmath28 is just an auxiliary field , with no kinetic term .",
    "it picks up a kinetic term from renormalization - group evolution and becomes dynamical below the scale @xmath29 .",
    "the vanishing of the kinetic term at @xmath30 is called a compositeness boundary condition .    at tree level ,",
    "the mass - squared of @xmath28 is positive , but it also gets radiative corrections . by dimensional analysis , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an anomalous dimension ( in the njl model , @xmath33 ) . for sufficiently large @xmath34 ,",
    "the top - higgs mass squared can be negative , signalling spontaneous symmetry breaking . in order for the top - higgs to get an expectation value @xmath35 lower than @xmath23",
    ", the anomalous dimension should be close to its critical value .",
    "that some tuning is required is not surprising , since the higgs mass is getting quadratic corrections .",
    "thus it is expected @xmath36  tev .",
    "if @xmath23 is a little larger , there is a little hierarchy problem .",
    "for much larger @xmath23 , the full hierarchy problem is reintroduced .    since the top - higgs vev and the top mass are generated from the same dynamics , they are related .",
    "explicitly , @xmath37 where @xmath38 represent the contribution from additional operators generated at the scale @xmath23 where topcolor is integrated out ( typically these are small corrections ) . since @xmath36 tev by naturalness , this log is small so we expect @xmath39 .",
    "typically @xmath40 gev .",
    "thus , topcolor as an explanation of electroweak symmetry breaking is incomplete .",
    "realistic models of top condensation have two sources of electroweak symmetry breaking : the first , topcolor , generates a ewsb vev around 60 - 100 gev . in topcolor - assisted technicolor , this is supplemented by another source of ewsb providing the remaining contribution to @xmath35 , such as technicolor .",
    "technicolor itself is a beautiful explanation of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 masses , but does not explain fermion masses",
    ". extended technicolor ( etc ) can explain the fermion masses through a new force , but has flavor problems .",
    "these flavor problems are ameliorated by assuming non - qcd like dynamics ( walking technicolor ) for the etc sector in which operators involving techniquarks run faster than operators involving standard model quarks . however , even these models have difficulty explaining the large top quark mass .",
    "in this way , topcolor `` assists '' technicolor by handling the top mass .",
    "the main ingredient of top - color assisted technicolor relevant to the top forward - backward asymmetry is simply that there are two ewsb sectors , and one of them couples only to the top quark at leading order .",
    "since the details of the technicolor side are irrelevant , we will abbreviate that sector with a simple scalar higgs doublet @xmath41 .",
    "this approximation is called bosonic topcolor  @xcite .      in this section",
    ", we briefly review the relevant ingredients in a realistic topcolor - assisted technicolor model . as explained in section  [ sec : overview ] , these models have two sources of electroweak symmetry breaking : one from the topcolor sector , generating a vev @xmath40 gev , and one from another sector . for simplicity , we will take this other sector to be a single higgs doublet model .",
    "this can be replaced with an extended technicolor sector with little consequence for the top asymmetry and the model bounds .",
    "our presentation will closely follow the hill - simmons review  @xcite , with a few added details and simplifications .

    "the cancellation can be seen by direct computation : top - pion exchange produces a @xmath46 amplitude with the same magnitude but opposite sign as top - higgs exchange , due to the extra @xmath47 in the pseudoscalar interaction .",
    "there is also a symmetry interpretation .",
    "if we write @xmath48 as a complex scalar , then @xmath49 can be thought of as carrying a chiral charge whose conservation forbids @xmath50 .",
    "this mechanism was employed in @xcite where a complex scalar was introduced directly for this purpose . here",
    "we are observing that the top - pion and top - higgs automatically combine into this complex scalar .",
    "the symmetry is broken by the top - pion / top - higgs mass splitting and any difference in couplings .",

    "these contributions are included in the right panel .",
    "we have not included interference effects for these extra channels , although when the top - pion and top - higgs are close in mass , there will be destructive interference in these channels as well .      having discussed all the experimental constraints separately , we will now consider combining all the measurements together .",

    "a light top - pion is probably ruled out by direct searches , although the precise bound depends on how the top - pion decays , which is somewhat model dependent .",

    "in fact , taking @xmath96 removes the same - sign bound completely and the @xmath94 bound is controlled by destructive interference between the new physics and the standard model , as we have discussed ..",
    "we have shown the neutral top - pion , the top - higgs and the neutral top - rho can combine to give a large top forward - backward asymmetry with small effects on the total @xmath7 cross section and a not - yet - detectable number of same - sign tops produced .",
    "these new particles do not generate any new strong flavor constraints .",
    "particles closely related to these , such as the charged top - pions or the charged top - rhos , can contribute to observables like @xmath97 .",
    "however , the charged top - pions could be heavy and the constraints would be weak . from the model - independent point of view",
    "the main point is that there are no strong flavor constraints directly involving only the particles related to the @xmath3 explanation .",
    "the top - mesons will have interesting signatures at the lhc depending on how they are produced and decay .",
    "generically , we know there should be a sizable coupling of these particles to @xmath7 and @xmath98 .",
    "if the top - pion is lighter than the top , it can decay to @xmath99 through an off - shell - top .",
    "particles heavier than the top could decay directly to @xmath98 .",
    "if the top - rho is heavy enough , it will decay to @xmath100 or @xmath101 rather than @xmath98 .",
    "the top mesons can be singly produced through gluon fusion through a top - loop .",
    "they can also be produced in association with a top , or a @xmath12 or @xmath13 or pair produced from @xmath10 through the exchange of a @xmath0-channel top .",
    "there are many possibilities .",
    "a generic consequence of having particles coupling strongly to @xmath1 is that there should be @xmath98 resonances visable at the lhc .",
    "for example , top - pion pair production would give a large number of @xmath102 events .",
    "a single top - pion could be produced in association with a top through @xmath103 .",
    "thus there would also be @xmath104 events . in general",
    ", looking at events with tops and jets and looking at top - jet invariance mass distributions should discover or rule out this model fairly early on at the lhc .",
    "one more consequence of the couplings we have discussed is that if there is a large @xmath105 coupling and the top - pion is lighter than the top , then we could have @xmath106 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath107 with a coupling @xmath108 , the branching ratio to this channel would be 7% , with the top decaying 93% of the time to @xmath109 . what this looks like depends on how the top - pion decays .",
    "the top - pion might decay to @xmath15 .",
    "this coupling is difficult to calculate if the @xmath110-quark mass comes from non - perturbative effects ( instantons ) in the top - color sector .",
    "it does get a calculable contribution from top / top - pion loops which make some branching fraction to @xmath15 inevitable .",
    "if the @xmath15 coupling is small enough then the decay mode @xmath111 or @xmath112 might dominate .",
    "alternatively , the decay @xmath113 through an off - shell top could dominate as well , depending on the couplings . in any case , the observed rate for the @xmath7 cross section is based on a leptonic branching ratio taken from the standard model .",
    "so it is possible that that @xmath7 rate might be slightly higher , with a slightly lower branching ratio to @xmath114 making the top production seem more consistent with the standard model than it actually is .",
    "let us consider the situation in which @xmath115 .",
    "then we would have @xmath116 7% of the time .",
    "this excess of hadronically decaying tops could help explain an excess seen by cdf in events with two massive fat jets  @xcite .",
    "it might also explain the recently observed excess in multijets near the top - mass seen by a different cdf group  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this decay mode could also explain the excess in @xmath12+jets events seen by cdf @xcite .",
    "for example , this excees could be produced by a top - rho decaying to @xmath117 , with @xmath115 .",
    "if @xmath86 decays to @xmath15 dominantly , then it is hard to explain the cdf excess since the peak does not seem to be rich in @xmath110 s .",
    "it is unclear without futher model details and more calculations whether the rate for production of these modes is consistent with the size of the excess .",
    "if the top - pions are heavier than @xmath67 , they can not be the explanation of the cdf @xmath12+jets bump . however , it is still possible that the bump might be due to particles in the technicolor sector , as proposed in  @xcite .",
    "these particles are also present in topcolor - assisted technicolor , but we have nothing new to say about them from previous work .",
    "the measurements of the top - quark forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron suggest new physics may be showing up strongly coupled to the top .",
    "that new physics would show up here is not surprising to the many theorists who have had to contend with the large mass hierarchy between the top mass and the other fermions .",
    "indeed , top - condensation and its realization in topcolor  @xcite was suggested more than 2 decades ago as a natural combination of dynamical symmetry breaking with an explanation of the large top quark mass .",
    "topcolor even predates the discovery of the top quark itself .",
    "when topcolor is combined with technicolor , the resulting framework , topcolor - assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) , provides a solution of the hierarchy problem and the large top quark mass without some of the strongest flavor - changing neutral current problems of extended technicolor itself .",
    "the combined framework explains the origin of mass as a team effort : the top mass comes from top - color , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 masses come mostly from technicolor , the @xmath110-quark mass comes from instantons , and the light quark masses come from extended technicolor . taking this one step further ,",
    "most of the visible matter in the universe is baryons , which get their masses from qcd , neutrino masses can come from the seesaw mechanism associated with additional new physics at a high scale , and dark matter might come from a totally decoupled sector , such as from axions .    in this paper",
    ", we have shown that tc2 also contains all ingredients for producing the large @xmath118 anomaly without violating other constraints .",
    "the spectrum contains three relevant particles , the neutral top - pion , the top - higgs and the neutral top - rho .",
    "all of these can have large top - up couplings due to mixing of the right - handed top with the lighter up - type right - handed quarks .",
    "this mixing can be naturally large in tc2 .",
    "thus , there is automatically an excess in the top - quark forward - backward asymmetry over the standard model due to @xmath0-channel exchange of these particles .",
    "intriguingly there is constructive interference among the particles in producing a large @xmath3 , but destructive interference affecting the overall @xmath7 cross section .",
    "same - sign top production is a signature of generic points in parameter space of this model .",
    "if the top - higgs and neutral top - pion are close in mass , the current experimental bound on same - sign top production can be avoided without much tuning .",
    "nevertheless , without additional symmetries , it seems impossible to avoid a same - sign top - signal , particularly from on - shell pion or top - higgs decays , which should be visible at the lhc early on . this would be a clear signature of this type of explanation of the @xmath3 excess .",
    "there are no devastating flavor problems in tc2 , even with large mixing .",
    "of course , tc2 does have difficulty with precision electroweak , but there is still no reliable way to calculate @xmath119 and @xmath120 and new particles can also contribute .",
    "thus it is impossible to rule out the model based on precision electroweak alone .",
    "flavor - changing neutral currents are not bad in tc2 because topcolor only couples to top , at leading order , so it naturally falls into next - to - minimal flavor violation @xcite .",
    "the light quark masses are generated with extended technicolor .",
    "however , because etc is no longer responsible for the bottom or top masses , the tuning required is not very severe .",
    "constraints such as the @xmath121 rate , @xmath122 , are dangerous , but not directly related to the particles responsible for explaining @xmath3 . to the extent that flavor physics is under control in previous incarnations of tc2 , they are under control here .",
    "top - color assisted technicolor has a number of signals that will show up early on at the lhc .",
    "the top - pions and other top - mesons should be produced in abundance .",
    "they can be singly produced through gluon fusion , as well as pair produced through @xmath0-channel top - exchange or produced in association with tops through @xmath123 initial states .",
    "top - pions can also be produced from decays of heavier top - particles . with large @xmath1 couplings necessary to explain @xmath3 , there should be an abundance of events with multiple tops and multiple jets .",
    "looking for a resonance peak in the top - jet invariant mass would be a clean test for this model .",
    "thus , forthcoming results from the lhc should soon reveal whether top - condensation can be the explanation to the large top forward - backward asymmetry observed at the tevatron .    : as this manuscript was being finalized , the cms collaboration released a same sign top bound from early lhc running  @xcite .",
    "this bound is somewhat stronger than the tevatron bounds .",
    "topcolor - assisted technicolor can still explain @xmath3 and be consistent with this observation , but the parameter space is more constrained : the top - higgs and neutral top - pion should be closer in mass ( if they are degenerate with the same coupling strength , same - sign top production is absent ) and the top - rho should also be on the heavier side , which is anyway consistent with some expectations from topcolor  @xcite .",
    "we thank sekhar chivukula , howard georgi , sunghoon jung , yasunori nomura and james wells for helpful discussions and daniel whiteson for helping us understand the cdf same - sign top results .",
    "this work is supported by the nsf under grants phy-0855591 and phy-0804450 and the doe under grant de - sc003916 .",
    "in this appendix , we give formulas for the partonic matrix elements for @xmath7 pair production .",
    "these formulas are useful for seeing the signs and strengths of various interference effects .",
    "@xmath124    where @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) denote the squared terms for single diagrams and @xmath127 @xmath128 denote the interferences .",
    "then we have @xmath129 and @xmath130",
    "in this appendix , we give formulas for the partonic matrix elements for same - sign top production .",
