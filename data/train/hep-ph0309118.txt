    "the lightest scalar mesons @xmath2 and @xmath3 , discovered more than thirty years ago , became the hard problem for the naive quark - antiquark ( @xmath5 ) model from the outset .",
    "really , on the one hand the almost exact degeneration of the masses of the isovector @xmath2 and isoscalar @xmath3 states revealed seemingly the structure similar to the structure of the vector @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons , and on the other hand the strong coupling of @xmath3 with the @xmath8 channel pointed unambiguously to a considerable part of the strange quark pair @xmath9 in the wave function of @xmath3 .    in 1977",
    "jaffe noted that in the mit bag model , which incorporates confinement phenomenologically , there are light four - quark scalar states @xcite .",
    "he suggested also that @xmath2 and @xmath3 might be these states with symbolic structures @xmath10 and @xmath11 . from that time @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "resonances came into beloved children of the light quark spectroscopy , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "ten years later we showed @xcite that the study of the radiative decays @xmath12 and @xmath13 can shed light on the problem of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons . over the next ten years before experiments ( 1998 )",
    "the question was considered from different points of view @xcite .",
    "now these decays have been studied not only theoretically but also experimentally .",
    "the first measurements have been reported by the snd @xcite and cmd-2 @xcite collaborations which obtain the following branching ratios @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 more recently the kloe collaboration has measured @xcite @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 in agreement with the novosibirsk data @xcite but with a considerably smaller error .    note that the isovector @xmath2 meson is produced in the radiative @xmath21 meson decay as intensively as the well - studied @xmath22 meson containing @xmath23 of @xmath9 , responsible for the decay ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "it is a clear qualitative argument for the presence of the @xmath9 pair in the isovector @xmath2 state , i.e. , for its four - quark nature .    since the one - loop model @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",
    "[ model ] , suggested at basing the experimental investigations @xcite , is used in the data treatment @xcite , the question on the mechanism of the scalar meson production in the @xmath21 radiative decays is put into the shade .",
    "we show below in section ii that the present data give the conclusive arguments in favor of the @xmath27 loop transition as the principal mechanism of @xmath2 and @xmath3 meson production in the @xmath21 radiative decays .    in section iii",
    "we show that the knowledge of this mechanism allows to conclude that the production of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the @xmath21 radiative decays is caused by the four - quark transitions .",
    "this constrains the large @xmath4 expansions of the decay amplitudes and gives new impressive evidences in favor of the four - quark nature of @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "section iv contains concluding remarks .",
    "in figs . [ myfiga0 ] and [ figf0 ] are shown the kloe data on @xmath28 @xcite and the snd data on @xmath29 @xcite ( 2000 ) respectively .",

    "notice that the ozi suppressed @xmath36 is caused by the large phase space ( including the @xmath37-wave factor ) of the @xmath38 states in comparison with the one of the @xmath8 states in the @xmath39 decay .",

    "see @xcite , at a sacrifice of the large phase spaces ( including the @xmath45 factor from gauge invariance ) in comparison with the ones in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 decays . taking into account rescatterings @xmath48 and @xmath49 does not change situation considerably ,",
    "@xcite .",

    "@xcite , that in the @xmath29 the @xmath8 intermediate states dominate for 950 - 980 mev , whereas the @xmath50 intermediate states dominate for 700 - 900 mev , is based on a mistaken hypothesis .",
    "the basic equation of the investigation in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( 3 ) , with the real @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( as the authors supposed ) is not correct .",

    "let us consider this question in detail .",
    "as is well know the imaginary part of a amplitude is a half of the sum of all possible discontinuities in all channels . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the discontinuities of the @xmath29 amplitude are caused only by the @xmath55 and @xmath56 amplitudes , that is , only by the @xmath50 intermediate states at the invariant mass of the @xmath50 state less than @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "but it is not the case .",

    "@xcite at all . at @xmath62",
    "the new two step real intermediate physical process @xmath63 and then @xmath64 opens and causes the discontinuity , which compensates the previous one , so that the sum of these two discontinuities vanishes at @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) in agreement with gauge invariance , as one can see from the behaviour of the contribution of the imaginary part in fig .",
    "[ g ] . certainly , the discontinuity in the @xmath21 channel , caused by the real @xmath38 intermediate states , is not essential , as discussed above .",
    "the @xmath6 contribution in the @xmath54 channel ( @xmath67 ) is discussed above also .",
    "its value in the branching ratio is calculated to within 20% @xcite because both the @xmath68 decay and the @xmath69 one are studied well enough .",
    "the absence of this contribution in the kloe data is caused by the experimental cutoff , which removes the @xmath70 events .",
    "the point is that the @xmath71 events are in the same region of the @xmath50 mass ( @xmath72 mev ) as the @xmath70 ones but they are only a small fraction of all @xmath73 events ( less than 10% ) . as a consequence the most part of them is removed by the above cutoff .    as for a contact",
    "@xmath74 interaction , which was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite to improve fitting data in a specific model , this could only replace `` the dominance of the @xmath27 intermediate states '' by `` the dominance of the @xmath8 intermediate states '' .",
    "notice , however , that the calculation of the @xmath74 interaction through the @xmath75 loops in a chiral theory requires the introduction of a conterterm which can be fixed now only by experiment . as for the experiment data , they can be described also without a @xmath74 contribution , see , refs . @xcite and figs . [ myfiga0 ] and [ figf0 ] .",
    "the resonance mass spectrum is of the form meson with another scalar isoscalar resonance , see also ref .",

    "this is precisely the function which is the subject of our investigation .    by gauge invariance ,",
    "the transition amplitude is proportional to the electromagnetic field strength tensor @xmath91 ( in our case to the electric field in the @xmath21 meson rest frame ) : @xmath92= g_r(m)\\left [ p_\\mu e_\\nu(\\phi ) - p_\\nu e_\\mu(\\phi)\\right]\\left [ k_\\mu e_\\nu(\\gamma ) - k_\\nu e_\\mu(\\gamma)\\right ] ,   \\label{gauge}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the @xmath21 meson and @xmath95 quantum polarization four - vectors , @xmath96 is the invariant amplitude free from kinematical singularities .",
    "since there are no charge particles or particles with magnetic moments in the process , there is no pole in @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , the function @xmath97 is proportional to @xmath98 ( at least ! ) in the soft photon region .    to describe the experimental spectra similar to the ones in figs .",
    "[ myfiga0 ] and [ figf0 ] , ] the function @xmath99 should be smooth ( almost constant ) in the range @xmath100 gev , see eq .",

    "requires @xmath104 gev@xmath105 .",
    "it seems to be incredible to explain the formation of such a huge radius in hadron physics .",
    "based on the large , by hadron physics standard , @xmath106 gev@xmath105 , one can obtain an effective maximum of the mass spectrum under discussion only near 900 mev . to exemplify this trouble",
    "let us consider the contribution of the isolated r resonance : @xmath107 .",
    "let also the mass and the width of the r resonance equal 980 mev and 60 mev , then @xmath108 .",
    "so stopping the @xmath88 function is the crucial point in understanding the mechanism of the production of @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances in the @xmath21 radiative decays .",

    "( [ spectrumr ] ) , so that we can not see the resonance in the region 980 - 995 mev .",
    "mev ( @xmath115 mev ) owes to gauge invariance also . ] the maximum in the spectrum is effectively shifted to the region 935 - 950 mev and 880 - 900 mev respectively .    in truth",
    "this means that @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances are seen in the radiative decays of @xmath21 meson owing to the @xmath27 intermediate state , otherwise the maxima in the spectra would be shifted to 900 mev .",
    "so the mechanism of production of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons in the @xmath21 radiative decays is established .",
    "both real and imaginary parts of the @xmath116 amplitude are caused by the @xmath27 intermediate state .",
    "the imaginary part is caused by the real @xmath27 intermediate state while the real part is caused by the virtual compact @xmath27 intermediate state , i.e. , we are dealing here with the four - quark transition .",
    "needless to say , radiative four - quark transitions can happen between two @xmath5 states as well as between @xmath5 and @xmath117 states but their intensities depend strongly on a type of the transitions .",
    "a radiative four - quark transition between two @xmath5 states requires creation and annihilation of an additional @xmath5 pair , i.e. , such a transition is forbidden according to the okuba - zweig - izuka ( ozi ) rule , while a radiative four - quark transition between @xmath5 and @xmath117 states requires only creation of an additional @xmath5 pair , i.e. , such a transition is allowed according to the ozi rule .",
    "let us consider this problem from the large @xmath4 expansion standpoint , using the g.t hooft rules @xcite : @xmath118 at @xmath119 and a gluon is equivalent to a quark - antiquark pair ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the point is that the large @xmath4 expansion is the most clear heuristic understanding of the ozi rule because the ozi forbidden branching ratio as a rule is suppressed by the factor @xmath121 , but not @xmath122 , in comparison with the ozi allowed decay . in our case",
    "the results analysis are even more interesting .",

    "in addition , in figs . [ reminder ] - [ a0f0fournc ] are not shown exchanges by planar gluons which do not change the large @xmath4 behaviour . ]",
    "let us begin our consideration with the @xmath5 model",
    ".    in the two - quark model @xmath123 , the large @xmath4 expansion of the @xmath124 amplitude starts with the ozi forbidden transition of the @xmath125 order : @xmath9 annihilation and @xmath126 creation , see fig .",
    "[ a0twonc ] .",
    "but its weight is bound to be small , because this term does not contain the @xmath27 intermediate state , which emerges only in the next to leading term of the @xmath127 ( ! )",

    "[ a0twonc ] .",
    "note that @xmath128 transition ( as intensive experimentally as @xmath129 ) does not require creation of an additional @xmath5 pair at all ( the ozi superallowed transition ) and has the @xmath130 order , see fig .",
    "[ reminder ] .",
    "in the two - quark model @xmath131 , which involves the @xmath132-@xmath133 mass degeneration , the large @xmath4 expansion of the @xmath134 amplitude starts also with the ozi forbidden transition of the @xmath125 order : @xmath9 annihilation and @xmath135 creation , see fig .",

    "[ reminder ] . ]",
    "[ f0twostrangenc ] , is bound to have a small weight in the large @xmath4 expansion of the @xmath138 amplitude , because this term does not contain the @xmath27 intermediate state , which emerges only in the next to leading term of the @xmath125 order , i.e. , in the ozi forbidden transition , see fig .",
    "[ f0twostrangenc ] . emphasize that the mechanism without creation and annihilation of the additional @xmath139 pair can not explain the @xmath140 spectrum because it does not contain the @xmath27 intermediate state !",
    "but if @xmath141 and @xmath3 mesons are compact @xmath8 states @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively , i.e. , four - quark states similar to states of the mit - bag model , bound states with the binding energy close to 20 mev , i.e.,in the extended molecule case , the contribution of the virtual intermediate @xmath27 states in the @xmath27 loop is suppressed by the momentum distribution in the molecule , and the real part of the loop amplitudes are negligible @xcite .",
    "it leads to the branching ratios @xcite much less than the experimental ones .",
    "in addition , the @xmath144 spectra in the @xmath8 molecule case are much narrower than the experimental ones , see the behavior of the imaginary part contribution in fig .",
    "the large @xmath4 expansions of the @xmath145 and @xmath134 amplitudes start with the ozi allowed transitions of the @xmath146 order , which require only creation the additional @xmath139 pair for the @xmath27 intermediate state , see fig .",
    "[ a0f0fournc ] .",
    "thus , it is shown that the @xmath147 decay intensity in the two - quark model and the @xmath148 decay intensity in the @xmath149 model are suppressed by the factor @xmath150 in comparison with the ones in the four - quark model , but in the @xmath151 model the @xmath148 decay intensity is suppressed only by the factor @xmath152 in comparison with the one in the four - quark model .",
    "it will be recalled that a ozi allowed hadronic decay amplitude , for example , the @xmath153 amplitude , see fig .",

    "in summary the fine threshold phenomenon is discovered , which is to say that the @xmath27 loop mechanism of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 scalar meson production in the @xmath21 radiative decays is established at a physical level of proof .",
    "the case is rarest in hadron physics .",
    "this production mechanism is the four - quark transition what constrains the large @xmath4 expansion of the @xmath129 and @xmath155 amplitudes and gives the new strong ( if not crucial ) evidences in favor of the four - quark nature of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons .",
