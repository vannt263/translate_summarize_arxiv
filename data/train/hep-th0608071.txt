    "we make the change of variables in the action ( [ s ] ) as follows : @xmath73 where @xmath74 where for the sake of convenience we introduced the characteristic energy density in the core of a defect : @xmath75 using ( [ ls ] ) the action ( [ s ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath76.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the action ( [ s change ] ) does not contain any small or large parameters ( apart from irrelevant overall prefactor ) , which means that in the rescaled units @xmath77 and @xmath78 the typical size of a defect is of order of @xmath37 . in the dimensionless units @xmath79 the size of a defect is given roughly by ( [ ls ] ) . restoring the dimensions we obtain for the typical size of a defect : @xmath80 where subscript @xmath81 stands for `` physical size '' .",
    "note , that in the standard case the scale @xmath16 drops out from the expression ( [ lph ] ) , as it should be and the size of a defect is given by @xmath82 .",

    "the behavior of @xmath84 is approximately as : @xmath85 in the case ( [ pow ] ) the approximation is : @xmath86 with @xmath19 given by ( [ ed ] ) .",
    "regardless of the choice of the masses @xmath16 and @xmath11 , the configuration of the fields far from the center of the topological defect is the same as a configuration of the fields for the standard kinetic term , because nonlinear corrections are small for @xmath87 ( [ model ] ) .        for a domain wall",
    "we can estimate its surface density : @xmath88 where we have used ( [ e ] ) and ( [ ls ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the mass of a domain @xmath4-wall @xmath89 to the mass of a standard domain wall @xmath90 is given simply by the ratio of their sizes : @xmath91 restoring the dimensions we can obtain from ( [ mass ] ) the surface energy of a domain wall in the physical units : @xmath92 note that in the standard case , @xmath72 , the surface energy does not depend on @xmath16 : @xmath93 .    the mass per unit length of a global vortex and the total mass of a monopole are formally divergent . however , in a cosmological context one can define a finite mass of a monopole cutting the integral at the position of the next monopole .",
    "the same procedure is applicable for global cosmic strings .",
    "masses of monopoles and cosmic strings defined in such a way are roughly composed of two parts : mass of a core of a defects which depends on the particular choice of @xmath14 ; and mass of a tail which depends only on the cut distance and is the same for any @xmath14 , because for small @xmath15 the non - linearities are small .",
    "before we study particular solutions , let us discuss constraints on the parameters of the model .",
    "the first constraint comes from the condition for the hyperbolicity .",

    "the hyperbolicity condition for perturbations reads @xcite : @xmath94 the stability of solutions in our case ( [ model ] ) for @xmath54 transforms to the simple inequality : @xmath95 note that the expression ( [ hcond ] ) is only a necessary condition for stability of a defect . depending on the precise form of the kinetic term @xmath14",
    "this condition can be too weak to provide the hyperbolicity and then the more delicate consideration of inequality ( [ hyperbolicity ] ) would be required .",
    "one can check , however , that our particular examples ( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ m2 ] ) meet the hyperbolicity condition ( [ hyperbolicity ] ) for @xmath96 .    as second constraint",
    "we demand that the nonlinear part of @xmath14 dominates inside the core of the defect .",
    "otherwise we end up with a `` standard '' solution arising in the model of the canonical kinetic term and a symmetry breaking potential .",
