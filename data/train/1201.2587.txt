    "when surveying the sky with the purpose of discovering new solar system objects known asteroids and comets are also being identified .",
    "it is desirable to separately treat the identification of the known moving objects for four reasons : to avoid claiming as a new discovery some well known object , to reduce the dataset while searching for new discoveries , to improve the orbits of the known objects while ensuring they are not contaminated by false associations and finally , for statistical quality control of the astrometric data using the residuals with the well known orbits .",
    "the procedure of assigning new observations to known objects is a special case of the class of _ identification problems _",
    "the problem arises because the same object is observed in short arcs separated by typically many years .",
    "the goal is to build the list of the observations belonging to the same physical object without introducing any _ false _ detections corresponding to another moving object , image defect , statistical fluke , or non - solar system object .",
    "the _ attribution problem _ occurs when a least squares orbit has already been fit to a set of historical observations of an object and we want to assign a new set of observations for which it is not possible to independently fit a least squares orbit .",
    "the methods for finding and confirming attributions were described in @xcite and were shown to be effective for both simulations and real data in @xcite ( see also , e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite then developed a high reliability statistical quality control procedure to confirm the attributions .",
    "the algorithms developed to date have been successful when the new data sets contain less information but are comparable in quantity and quality to the old one .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the special case in which the previously known asteroids have well constrained orbits while the new data to be attributed are sparse .",
    "there is typically just one _ tracklet _ , a very short arc of astrometric observations , assembled by the observer using just a linear or a quadratic fit to the astrometry as a function of time .",
    "the challenge is to account for the data asymmetry : a small number of new accurate observations per object from the state of the art surveys to be associated with the historical data set containing many low accuracy observations per object .",
    "the main difficulty of the asymmetric identification problem is that both the existing and new data are biased by the astrometric catalogs and a reliable astrometric error model ( including rigorously estimated rms and correlations ) is usually not available . as a consequence ,",
    "the better the orbit is constrained by the existing data the worse is the effect of the biases on the ephemerides predicted from the orbit and its covariance matrix . in the idealized case",
    "the existing data may have a larger standard deviation but be unbiased ( zero average astrometric error ) and the observational errors could be modeled by a normal distribution with known rms .",
    "a quantitative and real example might be more convincing than a theoretical argument .",
    "the _ _ astdys _ _ online service tells us that at the current date there are @xmath1 _ numbered _ or _ multi - apparition _ asteroids ( @xmath2 of those with apparent magnitude @xmath3 and solar elongation @xmath4 ) with a formal rms of the current ephemerides prediction @xmath5  arcsec .",
    "thus , a bias in the astrometry of the order of @xmath6 arcsec would result in a systematic error larger than the estimated random error . we show that the first of the next generation surveys , pan - starrs1 , ( ps1 ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) generates astrometric data with accuracy of @xmath7 to @xmath8 arcsec  of such high quality that if fit to orbits computed with biased historic data the two data sets would appear statistically incompatible .",
    "thus , it would be very difficult to validate the accuracy of the new data unless debiased data were available ( both historic and new ) .",
    "our two - step solution is to ( i ) devise a new statistical quality control procedure which is applied asymmetrically to the old and new data and ( ii ) apply a debiasing procedure to the mpc - archived historical observations to remove the known position - dependent bias due to regional systematic errors in the astrometric star catalogs @xcite .",
    "we tested our new methods for asymmetric attribution using early results from the ps1 telescope .",
    "the source orbits used were numbered and multi - apparition asteroids .",
    "the purpose of the test was to validate our asymmetric attribution method and measure the ps1 system s astrometric accuracy .",
    "in particular , we were interested in constructing a rigorous ps1 astrometric error model taking into account the correlations .",
    "as described    the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "the known algorithms for attribution are summarized in section  [ s : oldatt ] . the new algorithms to be applied specifically to the asymmetric case",
    "are introduced in section  [ s : knownatt ] . in section  [ s : debias ]",
    "we show the importance of the removal of the star catalog biases . in section  [ s : panstarrs ]",
    "we describe the results of two tests of our methods , both using ps1 data , and a first attempt at building a rigorous statistical error model for ps1 astrometry .",
    "section  [ s : acceff ] gives the results of the tests for the accuracy and efficiency of our algorithms using real data from the ps1 survey . in section  [ s : conclusions ] we draw some conclusions and indicate possible directions for future work .",
    "an _ attribution problem _ requires that there exist 1 ) a vector @xmath9 of orbital elements at epoch @xmath10 along with a @xmath11 _ covariance matrix _",
    "@xmath12 describing their uncertainty in the linearized approximation and 2 ) a vector @xmath13 of _ observables _ ( @xmath14 ) at another epoch @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the predicted set of observables at time @xmath15 using the covariance @xmath12 to _ propagate the covariance matrix to the space of the observables _ by the linearized formula @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath19 jacobian matrix of @xmath20 computed at @xmath21 .",
    "using @xmath22 we can assess the likelihood of the prediction @xmath23 being compatible with the hypothesis that the observation @xmath24 belongs to the same object within the linear approximation and assuming an unbiased gaussian error model .    for reasons of efficiency in handling large numbers of both orbits and",
    "tracklets this process should be implemented using a sequence of filters as described below .",
    "each step provides an increasing likelihood of identification with an increasing computational effort applied to a decreasing number of possible cases @xcite .",
    "the first test is to compare the new angular observations to the prediction on the celestial sphere in right ascension and declination @xmath25 .",
    "the difference @xmath26 is projected on the _ tangent plane to the celestial sphere_. from the @xmath27 covariance matrix @xmath22 we compute the _ normal matrix _ @xmath28 and the confidence ellipse @xmath29 the observation @xmath24 has its own uncertainty given by the @xmath30 covariance matrix @xmath31 and the normal matrix @xmath32 yielding a second confidence ellipse @xmath33 for the observed angles . in most cases",
    "we can assume the observation error is isotropic because the astrometric reduction process typically makes no distinction between the two directions .",
    "i.e. , @xmath34 can be assumed to be just a _ circle _ in the @xmath35 coordinates .",
    "this filtering step requires that the two ellipses intersect for reasonable values of the confidence parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 . since this filter may have to be applied for each orbit",
    "@xmath21 to a large set of new observations @xmath24 it is often convenient to resort to a simplified test using only the larger of the two ellipses .",
    "e.g. , @xmath38 when the uncertainty of the prediction is larger and @xmath39 when the observational errors are larger .",
    "when the orbit @xmath21 is already well determined ( as assumed in this work ) the two uncertainties can be comparable .",
    "a fast algorithm to handle this case is to select a control @xmath36 for @xmath40 and a circular radius @xmath37 for @xmath33 and then compute the inequality defining an ellipse with the semiaxes of @xmath40 increased in length by @xmath37 in the @xmath35 coordinates .",
    "this algorithm can be applied either to a single observation belonging to the set of observations for which attribution is attempted ( the tracklet ) or , better yet , to an _ average _ observation obtained from all those forming a tracklet because the averaging removes some of the random error .",
    "tracklets containing observations spanning a short time ( typically 15 min to 2 hours ) can generally be compressed into an _ attributable _ vector @xmath41 containing both the angular position and angular motion vector . in the special case of objects that are very close to the earth",
    "there is additional curvature information that may further constrain the range and range - rate @xcite .",
    "the attributable vector is obtained by a linear fit to the observations in the tracklet resulting in the observable @xmath42 at the average time @xmath15 with a @xmath43 normal matrix @xmath44 .",
    "the `` distance '' between the observed and predicted attributables is given by a metrics that takes into account the uncertainty of both data points using their respective normal matrices .",
    "the predicted attributable vector at time @xmath15 from the state @xmath45 is nominally @xmath46 with a @xmath43 normal matrix @xmath47 .",
    "its compatibility with the observed attributable vector can be described by the _ attribution penalty _ @xmath48 ( chap",
    ". 7 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) defined by @xmath49\\,({\\mathbf{z}}_o-{\\mathbf{z}}_c)\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that corresponds geometrically to testing the intersection of the confidence ellipsoids with @xmath50 playing the role of the confidence parameter",
    ".    we can discard attribution candidates when the attribution penalty exceeds a reasonable value of @xmath51 .",
    "if the predictions were perfectly linear and an exact gaussian error model was available for the observations then a @xmath52 table could be used to select @xmath51 but these conditions are never satisfied with real data .",
    "thus , the parameter should be determined empirically with simulations and/or tests with real data .",
    "attributions that pass the second filter need to be confirmed by a least squares fit with all the available observations .",
    "the fit must converge and yield residuals with good statistical properties compatible with what we know about the observational errors .",
    "the most common control is the rms of the residuals weighted with their accuracy .",
    "the attribution reliability can be increased with _ statistical quality controls _ based upon more than one parameter that also capture information based on systematic signals remaining in the residuals .",
    "we normally use the following 10 metrics :    * @xmath53 root mean square of the astrometric residuals are multiplied by @xmath54 before computing all the metrics .",
    "] , * @xmath55 bias , i.e. , average of the astrometric residuals , * @xmath56 first derivatives of the astrometric residuals , * @xmath57 second derivatives of the astrometric residuals , * @xmath58 third derivatives of the astrometric residuals , * @xmath59 rms of photometric residuals in magnitudes .    to use the same controls for both historic and new data ( that are typically of different accuracy ) we normalize the bias and derivatives of the residuals by fitting them to a polynomial of degree 3 and dividing the coefficients by their standard deviation obtained from the covariance matrix of the fit .",
    "this filter has been shown to be effective in removing false identifications @xcite using pan - starrs survey simulations .",
    "the advantage of using simulations is that it is then possible to use the _ ground truth _ ,",
    "i.e. , the _ a priori _ knowledge of the correspondence between objects and their observations , to verify the identifications .",
    "the control parameters can then be adjusted to obtain the desired balance between efficiency and accuracy .",
    "the values of the controls selected in this way are close to 1 as expected from gaussian statistics ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) because the orbits are already well constrained .",
    "note that the survey which was simulated does not correspond exactly to the realized ps1 survey .",
    "what matters for our argument is that , since the false identifications are proportional to the square of the number of tracklets , it was a pseudo - realistic large scale simulation with a huge number of ` known objects ' and detected tracklets .",
    "the algorithms to be used to propose attributions in a strongly asymmetric situation ( such as high - accuracy numbered asteroid orbits with new un - attributed tracklets ) can be more or less as described above , but the methods to confirm the attributions require additional controls .",
    "the main reason is the presence of biases in the astrometric errors .",
    "figure  [ fig : bias_astdys_apr10 ] shows that the normalized biases of astrometric residuals for the over - determined orbits of numbered asteroids are strikingly different from a zero - mean gaussian .",
    "the normalized declination bias is qualitatively different from a gaussian with a mean of @xmath60 and a standard deviation of @xmath61 . in right ascension",
    "the shape is not too different from a normal distribution but with a non - zero mean of @xmath62 and standard deviation of @xmath63 .",
    "the span , curvature and z - sign have similar non - gaussian distributions although the declination bias is the worst case .",
    "the causes of this behavior and the methods to mitigate their effects are discussed in section  [ s : debias ] .",
    "we need to take into account that the values of the quality metrics are already high even before the attribution when attributing new observations to objects with strongly over - determined orbits .",
    "thus , we can not use small values of the control parameters because it would generate the paradoxical result that the already computed orbit should be discarded before adding new observations .",
    "even if the new observations improve the orbit determination because they are of better quality and/or extend the observational time span , the systematic error signatures contained in the residuals of the existing orbit are not going to be removed . on the other hand ,",
    "if we use high values of the controls we may fail to reject some false attributions .    our solution is to take into account the values of the metrics _ and _ the amount they change as a result of the proposed attribution .",
    "e.g. , for the @xmath53 metrics we accept an attribution only if the increase resulting from the attribution is small ( we used @xmath64 in table  [ tab : deb_panst ] ) . for the other 8 metrics that are based upon astrometric residuals we set an upper limit to the increase in the absolute value ( we used @xmath65 in table  [ tab : deb_panst ] ) .",
    "the new observations may have little effect on the statistical properties of the complete set of residuals because the tracklets contain typically only @xmath66 to @xmath67 observations while the existing data set typically contains tens or even hundreds of observations , i.e. , the residuals may be neither significantly better nor significantly worse .",
    "thus , we need to separately consider the residuals of the attributed observations for which we require the @xmath53 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( typical tracklets have no significant curvature and even less z - sign ) . for the tests reported in table  [ tab : deb_panst ] we have used the controls @xmath70 .",
    "these values were chosen empirically based on our experience with both real data and simulations as reported in @xcite .",
    "our experience suggests that it is not possible to use theoretically motivated control values from e.g. , a @xmath52 table although they must be of the theoretical order .",
    "the attribution procedure is recursive with tracklets added one by one proceeding in order from the most to least likely as measured by the penalty @xmath48 .",
    "when an attribution has passed all the quality controls and a new orbit has been fit to all the observations including the new tracklet , the new orbit becomes the object s reference orbit .",
    "then , the other tracklets proposed for attribution from filter 2 are passed to filter 3 and quality control , and so on .",
    "this procedure is robust but we can not claim that it is perfectly reliable .",
    "due to the stochastic nature of the observational errors any attribution may be wrong ; even those that result in the determination of a numbered asteroid orbit , although the probability of this happening has to be very small .",
    "despite the probability being small , when there are a large number of trials the odds of finding low probability events approaches unity .",
    "our processing attributed a 4-observation ps1 tracklet from the year 2010 to the numbered asteroid ( 229833 ) 2009 bq@xmath71 ; however , the fit to all the available data required discarding 6 observations that were designated 2000  ku@xmath72 from the apparition in the year 2000 . in this case the only way to decide",
    "which attribution to ( 229833 ) is correct might be to reexamine the original observations .",
    "the most important source of systematic errors in observations of solar system objects is in the star catalog used for astrometric reduction .",
    "@xcite suggested that the errors could be mitigated by debiasing the astrometric asteroid data with the measured regional catalog biases .",
    "the biases can be computed as the average difference in position between the stars in one catalog with respect to another more accurate catalog .",
    "@xcite used the 2mass star catalog @xcite as their reference because it is of good accuracy and covers the entire sky with a sufficient number of stars per unit area .",
    "the catalog used for the astrometric reduction of each asteroid observation is available for @xmath73 of the existing ccd data .",
    "we have implemented an error model consistent with @xcite by 1 ) debiasing the observations by subtracting their calculated biases and 2 ) assigning a per - observation weight that is inversely proportional to the debiased rms residuals given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 6 ) ( for the same observatory and the same catalog when known ) .",
    "more precisely , the weight was @xmath74 when known but set to @xmath75 arcsec@xmath76 for data after 1950 , for observations performed by photographic techniques , and for ccd observations that do not include star catalog information .",
    "figure  [ fig : bias_debiased_apr10 ] shows that the bias distribution is much less asymmetric after implementation of the error model .",
    "the mean of the normalized biases is now @xmath77 in declination ( standard deviation @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 in right ascension ( standard deviation @xmath80 ) .",
    "the debiased set of declinations is still biased but improves by a factor @xmath81 and the debiased right ascensions has biases at the level of the quality of the best catalogs and is as good as it can currently be .",
    "thus , the observation debiasing and weighting improves the performance of the asymmetric attribution algorithms but highlights that improvements in the star catalogs are still necessary to take advantage of modern high - accuracy asteroid astrometry .        another way to quantify",
    "the improvement of the orbit fit is to measure the residuals with respect to ps1 observations of numbered asteroids .",
    "the histograms in figure  [ fig : rd_f51 ] show a significant improvement in the declination residuals due to the debiasing ; the effect is also significant but less pronounced in right ascension .",
    "the debiasing procedure improves the rms of the residuals from @xmath82 to @xmath83 arcsec in ra and from @xmath84 to @xmath85 arcsec in dec .    to take advantage of the significant improvements obtained using the @xcite debiasing the orbit catalogs used for all the tests described in the next two sections",
    "have been computed in this way .",
    "the technique is now implemented in the free software orbfit , version 4.2 and later .",
    "the debiased orbit catalogs are now available from the astdys online service .",
    "the pan - starrs prototype telescope , ps1 , has a @xmath86  m diameter primary ( with an equivalent aperture of @xmath87  m after accounting for the large secondary ) , a @xmath88  gigapixel camera , and @xmath89 square degree field of view @xcite .",
    "the ps1 sky survey is intended to serve multiple scientific goals ( e.g. , in the solar system * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for which accurate astrometry is just one of many necessary requirements .",
    "the all - sky coverage ( from hawaii ) combined with the pixel scale of @xmath90 arcsec makes ps1 potentially capable of excellent astrometry of solar system objects .",
    "the ps1 survey began acquiring engineering data in 2009 and the first tests with our known_server software that implements the algorithms described herein were run on data taken in june / july of that year .",
    "these tests showed that the ps1 astrometry of small solar system objects was extremely good with a standard deviation of @xmath62 arcsec in right ascension , @xmath91 arcsec in declination , and a very small bias .",
    "( the small bias was due to chance as the observed region of the sky had less star catalog errors than average as discussed below . )",
    "ps1 officially began surveying in may 2010 but the first year s data set is not fully homogeneous because there were many adjustments to the telescope , camera , survey scheduling , image processing , etc .",
    "nevertheless , the full set of ps1 observations allows us to assess the way the biases change with right ascension .",
    "we achieve a more detailed analysis of the ps1 system performance using a smaller but homogeneous dataset .",
    "we can assess the regional residual systematic errors in the star catalogs using ps1 attributions to numbered asteroids observed through april 2011 that are widely distributed on the celestial sphere .",
    "note that no debiasing is applied for the ps1 astrometry since it already uses the 2mass catalog @xcite that was used as the reference catalog in the debiasing procedure @xcite .",
    "declination is due to the medium deep fields ( see section  [ s : rmscorr]).,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ]   declination is due to the medium deep fields ( see section  [ s : rmscorr]).,title=\"fig:\",width=377 ]    figure  [ fig : ra_dec_hist ] shows the number distribution of the observations as a function of right ascension and declination .",
    "the dramatic dips in the ra number distribution at about @xmath92 and @xmath93 are where the galactic plane crosses the equator .",
    "the ps1 system has a reduced asteroid detection efficiency in the galactic plane because of stellar over - crowding .",
    "the distribution is also not uniform in declination but there are enough data for our purposes over most of the range between @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the right ascension residual bias is strongly dependent on right ascension as shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : raresra_dec ] .",
    "there is a pronounced maximum of more than @xmath7 arcsec between @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "note that our first test data set of june / july 2009 was taken between @xmath98 and @xmath99 of right ascension where the biases appear to be only around @xmath100 arcsec . on the contrary",
    ", there is only a weak dependence of the declination residual biases upon right ascension .",
    "the location of the dips to @xmath101 arcsec for the declination residual ( see bottom panel of figure  [ fig : raresra_dec ] ) match the ranges in ra with limited asteroid statistics as shown in figure  [ fig : ra_dec_hist ]  where the galactic plane crosses the equator .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig : ra_decresgallat ] highlights the relationship between the biases of the residuals and galactic latitude .",

    "we expect this problem would be removed by debiasing the 2mass catalog in turn with an even better catalog such as the one to be produced by the gaia mission .      to assess the current ps1 astrometry we have used a homogeneous dataset processed with the same image processing software and astrometric reduction based upon the 2mass star catalog . as noted above",

    "the rms computed with respect to the mean is less sensitive but it too can change within a range of @xmath100 arcsec .",
    "we also computed the correlations among the residuals of the same coordinate that belong to the same tracklet .",
    "they have a large spread that depends on the observed region in the sky and also upon the removal of the constant bias ( the mean of the residuals ) .",
    "this is not a surprise since if the data are processed ignoring the presence of a bias then the bias reappears as a correlation .",
    "the only unexpected result is the size of this effect with apparent correlations up to @xmath113 in ra and @xmath114 in dec . in the @xmath115 wide md field",
    "the overall bias is much less because the target area is subject to low biases in the 2mass catalog and the removal of the overall mean is almost equivalent to a direction - sensitive debiasing .",
    "this results in in - tracklet correlations in the range @xmath116 to @xmath117 .",
    "these values are a good measure of the intrinsic correlation of data taken over a short time span ( such as data from the same tracklet ) .",
    "these results imply that we are not yet ready to build a ps1 error model that fully accounts for biases and correlations because these two effects can not yet be neatly separated . to use all the information contained in the precise ps1 observations we would need to first apply a 2mass catalog @xcite debiasing , measure the correlation , and then build a ps1-specific error model and explicitly account for the correlations ( as was done by @xcite ) .",
    "since this is a significant undertaking it needs to be the subject of our future work and we need to find a method to handle the data in a statistically correct manner .",
    "there are two main conclusions to be drawn from the analysis of the ps1 data .",
    "first , the precision of the ps1 astrometry is very good .",
    "the random component of the error model for the residuals in both ra and dec has a standard deviation ranging between @xmath118 and @xmath119 arcsec ( see the bold lines in table  [ tab : deb_panst ] ) .",
    "this is reasonable taking into account the typical ps1 point spread function ( psf ) full - width at half - max of @xmath120 arcsec , the pixel scale of @xmath121 arcsec , that asteroids move slightly during the ps1 exposures , and that the vast majority of the reported ps1 asteroid detections have a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in the range of 5 - 10 ( i.e. , for over - sampled psfs we expect the astrometric precision to be @xmath122 , @xcite ) .",
    "only a few professional asteroid observers regularly achieve this astrometric accuracy and of the large surveys only the sloan digital sky survey appears to have reached such precision .",
    "the ps1 advantage is that it achieves this accuracy over the entire sky during a long term survey and will generate a huge volume of data . in 2010",
    "ps1 was the fifth largest contributor of numbered asteroid observations to the mpc with @xmath123 ( in the first 11 months of 2011 it was fourth with @xmath124 ) .",
    "second , the accuracy of the ps1 astrometry is limited by the presence of systematic errors in the reference star catalog .",
    "although 2mass @xcite is the best possible choice for a star catalog it still contains systematic effects at up to the level of @xmath7 arcsec that are easily detectable with the modern generation of sky surveys . as a consequence , it is not yet possible to fully capitalize on the astrometric precision available from surveys like ps1 . the problem could be solved either with new and improved star catalogs ( e.g. , the ones expected from the gaia mission ) or by building a survey - specific ps1 star catalog that is referenced to a catalog with smaller regional biases such as tycho-2 or hipparcos .",
    "in addition to the position - dependent biases there is also an intrinsic correlation among the observations belonging to the same tracklet that we are not able to model accurately at this time .    to ensure that the ps1 observations yield the best possible nominal solutions and reliable covariance estimates the ps1 residuals must be weighted in a manner that accounts for systematic errors and their correlations .",
    "that is , if we use a model that ignores biases and correlations the confidence region of the observations of the same tracklet needs to be a sphere containing the ellipsoid representing the confidence region of the debiased and correlated model .",
    "if we assume the correlated covariance matrix of the ras of the tracklets with @xmath125 observations has variances @xmath126 on the diagonal and all correlations are equal to @xmath127 ( i.e. , the covariances are all @xmath128 ) then the largest eigenvalue is @xmath129 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.8 ) . with @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 the maximum eigenvalue is @xmath133 .",
    "thus , the worst case from table  [ tab : deb_panst ] requires a weight of @xmath134 arcsec@xmath76 .",
    "indeed , astdys uses a weight of @xmath135 to process the ps1 data  the highest weight for any asteroid survey . some asteroid programs with either special instruments / methods or very labor intensive reduction procedures",
    "do have higher weights .",
    "we are not claiming that this weighting scheme is the best or only solution for handling high precision data from modern surveys  only that it is a prudent way to use the ps1 data while waiting for a more sophisticated error model that could be obtained by a better bias removal and by an explicit correlation model .",
    "the purpose of this section is to measure the accuracy and the efficiency of our asymmetric attribution procedure .",
    "_ accuracy _ is the fraction of correct attributions among those proposed by our method while _ efficiency _ is the fraction of possible attributions that were found .",
    "it is very difficult to measure accuracy with real data because it is impossible to know the _ ground truth _",
    "( i.e. , which attributions are true / false ) while measuring accuracy with simulated data would be less convincing because it is difficult to simulate all possible causes of false data ( at the single detection , tracklet , and attribution level ) . in any event ,",
    "false data tend to generate tracklets with randomly oriented angular velocity that are less likely to be attributed to a real asteroid orbit .",
    "we therefore consider an attribution test with real tracklets and real objects to be more valuable at least for the same number of tracklets under consideration .",
    "our solution has been to use the fact that our dataset of proposed attributions can be split in two disjoint subsets : numbered and multi - apparition asteroids .",
    "the set of all attributions to numbered objects is robust and contains only a very small fraction of false attributions .",
    "if a tracklet has a successful attribution to a numbered asteroid then it can not be attributed to a different asteroid .",
    "thus any tracklet that is already attributed to a numbered asteroid would almost certainly be a false attribution if it could also be attributed to a multi - apparition asteroid .",
    "in our test we used the set of @xmath136 tracklets attributed to numbered asteroids in lunation 139 of the ps1 @xmath106 survey and attempted to find attributions to a list of @xmath137 multi - apparition orbits using our algorithm for the asymmetric case .",
    "the multi - apparition orbits provide much less accurate ephemerides and finding an observation inside the confidence ellipse of one of the many tested orbits is not a rare event .",
    "the first filter provided @xmath138 candidate attributions , the second filter reduced the number to 8 , and the third yielded 3 tracklets incorrectly attributable to two asteroids : 2010 gu@xmath139 ( 2 tracklets ) and 2010 gk@xmath140 ( 1 tracklet ) .    for comparison , our algorithm attributed @xmath141 tracklets to @xmath142 multi - apparition asteroids in the same lunation after removing all the tracklets that were already attributed to numbered asteroids .",
    "thus , the false attribution rate can be estimated at either @xmath143 or @xmath144 which is @xmath145 per lunation per observable object .",
    "this result is statistically good but can not be ignored because such false attributions would introduce permanent ` damage ' in the orbit database .",
    "the false attribution rate can be reduced to zero through additional controls .",
    "the two asteroids 2010 gu@xmath139 and 2010 gk@xmath140 for which false attributions were found have a historical set of observations that only weakly constrain the orbit : two apparitions widely spaced in time ( 19992010 and 20012010 respectively ) and not many observations ( 16 and 18 respectively ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath146 ephemeris confidence ellipses at the time of the incorrect attribution have major semiaxes of about @xmath147 and @xmath148 arcmin , respectively .",
    "this explains why it was possible to find a false attribution passing the quality controls in a sample of @xmath149 tracklets .",
    "moreover , in the first case the two attributed tracklets were from a single night and in the second there was only one tracklet .",
    "thus , another filter should not accept single - night attributions to objects that have been observed in only two previous apparitions . as a matter of fact",
    ", the minor planet center has enforced this rule for a long time and we acknowledge that this rule is a meaningful caution to avoid contamination of the orbits database by spurious attributions such as the ones found in our test .      determining the efficiency of our attribution method suffers from the same concerns addressed above regarding the use of real or synthetic data . once again , we decided to rely on real data and used the astdys catalog of numbered and multi - apparition asteroids to identify a set of asteroids whose ephemeris definitely places them in each field of view .",
    "the ps1 limiting magnitude is _ fainter _ than most known asteroids when they are at opposition so we used objects identified in one night of morning _ sweet spot _",
    "observations ( looking eastwards before sunrise at solar elongations between @xmath150 and @xmath151 in the @xmath152 filter ) .",
    "main belt asteroids are fainter in the sweet spots than at opposition due to distance and phase angle effects so that their range in apparent magnitude is better suited to determining the ps1 sensitivity as a function of the object s brightness .",
    "then we ran known_server using the same catalog of orbits and all the observed tracklets in the same fields to identify objects in the list of those which could have been observed because they were in the field of view of the ps1 sensor .",
    "the efficiency is simply the fraction of observable objects that were actually detected .",
    "if the false attribution rate is @xmath145 as discussed in the previous subsection the statistics of the successful attributions will not be significantly contaminated .",
    "figure  [ fig : known5863 ] shows that the attribution efficiency as a function of predicted apparent _ v _ magnitude has a sharp decline at the limiting magnitude of @xmath153 ( where the efficiency drops to half the peak value ) .",
    "the peak efficiency of @xmath154 occurs at @xmath155 but decreases by less than a standard deviation in the brightest bin near @xmath156 to @xmath157 .",
    "note that the well known offset of a few tenths of a magnitude between predicted and actual asteroid @xmath158 magnitudes @xcite is unimportant  all we care about here is the peak efficiency independent of magnitude .",
    "the problem in interpreting these results is that they measure several different contributions to the efficiency including the _ fill factor _",
    "( @xmath159 , the fraction of the focal plane covered by active sensing pixels ) , the detector sensitivity ( @xmath160 ) , the efficiency of the image processing pipeline ( ipp ) in detecting moving objects ( @xmath161 ) , the moving object processing system s ( mops ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) efficiency at linking detections into tracklets ( @xmath162 ) , and the efficiency of the attribution algorithm ( @xmath163 ) . disentangling each effect as a function of @xmath158 is difficult but unnecessary for our purposes .",
    "instead , we know that the generic efficiency @xmath164 and attempt to establish a minimum value of @xmath163 .",
    "the ps1 camera consists of 60 orthogonal transfer array ( ota ) ccds arranged in an @xmath165 array ( the four corners do not have ccds ) and each ota contains an on - chip @xmath165 mosaic of ` cells ' .",
    "the camera fill factor includes the physical gaps between otas , smaller gaps between cells on a single ota , area lost to defective cells and bad pixels , and the overlap between the sensor and the field of view ( fov ) of the optical system .",
    "there are additional losses of the order of @xmath166 specific to individual exposures due to a ` dynamic mask ' applied to remove bright diffraction spikes and internal reflections .",
    "the ps1 image processing team produces periodic analysis of sensor fill factor as the camera tuning improves .",
    "the most recent study ( may 2010 ) yields @xmath167 due to a @xmath168 loss due to inter - ota gaps , a @xmath169 loss due to inter - cell gaps , and @xmath170 mask fraction in the un - vignetted 3.0-degree fov . for our known_server efficiency study",
    "we only consider asteroids that should appear in the 3.0-degree fov so @xmath167 is applicable .",
    "the fill factor estimate implies that the peak efficiency ( at magnitudes between 19 and 20 ) leaves little room for losses due to the ipp , mops , and attribution software .",
    "each of the processing steps has a minimum efficiency of @xmath171 .",
    "i.e. , the overall efficiency is dominated by the fill factor and the efficiency of the other steps including attribution is consistent with 100% .",
    "the apparent drop in the efficiency for brighter apparent magnitudes is not significant .",
    "it might indicate some problems in the image processing and accurate astrometric reduction of bright detections .",
    "the ps1 ccds saturate at about @xmath172 and the @xmath152-filter is used for sweet spot observations .",
    "we proposed a new procedure to identify known asteroids among the new observations from a survey .",
    "this procedure solves the problems due to the asymmetry in quantity and quality between the data and historic observations .",
    "we tested the procedure with real data from the pan - starrs ps1 survey and assessed the performance of our algorithms and the astrometric accuracy of the survey data .",
    "the main results are the following .",
    "first , the new algorithms are accurate and efficient . for multi - apparition asteroids the false attribution fraction is less than @xmath173 and even those can be eliminated by following the mpc s good practice of requiring two nights of data for a recovery at a new apparition . the algorithm s attribution efficiency is high and consistent with 100% but can not really be measured because it is entangled with other efficiency losses such as the fill factor .",
    "second , the ps1 data have significantly lower astrometric error than other asteroid surveys .",
    "this error can be identified only after removing the biases due to systematic errors in the star catalogs .",
    "indeed , we arrived at the conclusion that even the 2mass star catalog contains enough biases to affect the ps1 error model .",
    "it is likely that the use of other catalogs , or at least debiasing with respect to them , would further improve the ps1 error model ; e.g. , tycho-2 could be used now and the gaia catalog in the future .",
    "third , we consider that the ps1 data can be included in the fit for asteroid orbits with weights corresponding to @xmath135 arcsec@xmath76 that implicitly account for the effects of correlations .",
    "a model with debiasing of the 2mass astrometry and explicitly taking into account the correlations could allow a further improvement in the diagonal elements of the weighting matrix by another factor @xmath174 .",
    "apart from the improvements mentioned above there are three areas where there is room for future developments .",
    "the first is in the use of known_server , or similar algorithms and software , as a filter to remove observations of known objects from a new set of data to leave subset with a larger fraction of potential new discoveries .",
    "although we think that this principle is valid we have not yet been able to test the idea on real data . for the removal of the known objects to be a significant contribution in decreasing the false identification rate , the false tracklet rate must be below some threshold and the number of known objects must be large compared to the number of unknown objects at the system s limiting magnitude . for the current ps1 data the false discoveries due to spurious detections ( that form false tracklets ) are more important than the false discoveries due to incorrect linking of true tracklets .",
    "the second is the possibility of using known_server as an alarm to detect unusual phenomena in well known asteroids .",
    "the most interesting cases could be the main belt comets ( mbc ,   * ? ? ?",
    "as an example , the numbered asteroid ( 300163 ) was found to be a mbc on the basis of ps1 observations that showed an image wider than the psf of nearby stars @xcite . however , the standard known_server output automatically flags these observations as very unusual in at least 3 different ways .",
    "two of the strange flags are astrometric in nature : @xmath175 , corresponding to a systematic shift by @xmath176 arcsec backward ( with respect to orbital motion ) , and @xmath177 , corresponding to a shift by @xmath178 arcsec north .",
    "these could be interpreted as an effect of displacement of the center of light with respect to the center of mass , and/or as an effect of non - gravitational perturbations .",
    "the other strange flag was that the observation s apparent magnitudes were on average brighter than the predicted ones by about @xmath179 which is also likely a consequence of the outburst .",
    "the problem is to define a filter selecting anomalous behaviors such as the one above as an indication of possible orbital , luminosity and/or image shape changes .",
    "the main challenge is to design such a filter with a low false positive rate that allows for dedicated follow up of the mbc candidates .",
    "the third is the possibility of improving the quality of other existing large datasets ( such as those generated by other sky surveys or even the mpc asteroid astrometry database ) by either detecting missing attribution or proposing deletion of dubious ones .",
    "this work would require the collaboration of the data providers for their insight on the datasets problems .",
    "the ps1 surveys have been made possible through contributions of the institute for astronomy , the university of hawaii , the pan - starrs project office , the max - planck society and its participating institutes , the max planck institute for astronomy , heidelberg and the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics , garching , the johns hopkins university , durham university , the university of edinburgh , queen s university belfast , the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics , and the las cumbres observatory global telescope network , incorporated , the national central university of taiwan , and the national aeronautics and space administration under grant no .",
