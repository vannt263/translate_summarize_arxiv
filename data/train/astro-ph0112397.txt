    "the high energy transient explorer ( space.mit.edu/hete/ ) hete-2 is dedicated to the study of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "hete-2 is currently the only grb detector capable of localizing and disseminating grb coordinates in near real - time .",
    "low - energy emission during and shortly after a grb ( @xmath1  hr ) potentially holds the key to significant progress in understanding the central engine of grbs and could provide valuable clues to their progenitors @xcite .",
    "the hete-2 detection of grb  010921 together with data from the interplanetary network ( ipn ) provided the first hete-2 localization which has resulted in the detection of an optical afterglow .",
    "although the afterglow was relatively bright , early observations of the error box failed to reveal any candidate afterglows because of source confusion with its bright host galaxy ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy of the host galaxy performed with the palomar 200-in telescope four weeks after the burst indicates a redshift of @xmath3  @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "on 21 september 2001 at 05:15:50.56  ut ( september 21.21934  ut ) the fregate instrument detected a bright grb ( trigger  1761 ) .",
    "grb  010921 had a duration of @xmath5  s in the 8 - 85  kev band , a peak flux of @xmath6 and a fluence of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "for a spatially flat frw cosmology ( @xmath8 = 0.3 , @xmath9 = 0.7 , and @xmath10 = 65 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 ) the measured redshift implies an equivalent isotropic energy release of @xmath12  erg . this inferred energy would be within the range suggested by @xcite for the standard energy reservoir , @xmath13  erg , suggesting the opening angle of the gamma - ray jet in grb  010921 is modest .",
    "the burst was also detected in the wide field x - ray monitor wxm  x detector but was outside the field - of - view of the wxm  y detector @xcite .",
    "because the grb was not well localized in the y direction , a location was not distributed with the real - time trigger .",
    "approximately five hours after the grb , ground analysis gave a long narrow error box ( @xmath14 ) centered at @xmath15 ( j2000.0 ) @xcite .",
    "_ ulysses _ and _ bepposax _ also detected grb010921 .",
    "these detections resulted in an ipn triangulation approximately 15  hours after the burst .",
    "the ipn location for the burst is an annulus centered at @xmath16 ( j2000.0 ) , with radius of @xmath17 .",
    "the combined hete-2/ipn data resulted in an error box with an area of a @xmath18 box with corners at @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , ( j2000.0 ) @xcite .",
    "although no coordinates were distributed with the real - time hete-2 trigger , the @xmath23 , 0.11-m lotis telescope @xcite observed the position of the error box during routine sky patrol on september  21 ut at 21.255  ut and 21.417  ut , only 52  min and 4.75 hours after the grb .",
    "the lotis telescope consists of four lens / camera systems directed toward a common @xmath24 field - of - view .",
    "two of the lotis cameras are equipped with clear filters , one with a standard cousins @xmath25 filter , and one with the standard johnson @xmath26 filter . during sky patrol observations the lotis telescope obtained 50  s exposures at each position on the sky .",
    "grb010921 was also observed with the sloan digital sky survey s ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) photometric telescope ( pt ) , which is located at apache point observatory ( apo ) in sunspot , new mexico .",
    "the pt is an @xmath27 , 0.5-m telescope equipped with @xmath28 filters .",
    "the sdss is designed to be on the @xmath28 photometric system described in fukugita et al .",
    "( 1996 ) which is an @xmath29 system where flat spectrum objects ( @xmath30 ) have zero colors .",
    "however , the current photometric calibration of the pt may differ from this system by at most a few percent ( stoughton et al . 2002 ) , and we therefore denote the pt photometric magnitudes by @xmath31 . the single site @xmath32 ccd camera has a @xmath33 field - of - view . on september 22 ut beginning at 22.108 ut ( 21.33 hours after the grb ) 200 s exposures were taken in each of the @xmath28 filters , and on september 23 ut , beginning at 23.224 ut 200 s and 400 s exposures were taken in each of the same filters ( lamb et al .",
    "observations on both nights covered the entire improved hete-2 error box ( ricker et al .",
    "2001 , hurley et al . 2001 ) .",
    "since the grb exposures were unusually long , the afterglow was near the sky level in most of the images , and conditions were cloudy at the time , magnitude errors are uncharacteristically large .      the center of the ipn error box for grb  010921 was added to the super - lotis sky patrol table and observations of the location began shortly after nightfall on september  22.128  ut .",
    "super - lotis is an @xmath34 , 0.6-m boller&chivens telescope at kitt peak near tucson , arizona .",
    "its focal plane array is a loral @xmath32 ccd camera covering @xmath35 field - of - view .",
    "the telescope system is fully automated and is capable of responding to a real - time grb trigger within 30 seconds .",
    "a total of twenty 50-second exposures were obtained during the first epoch . super - lotis re - observed the field on september 22 and 23 ut beginning at 22.267 , 23.128 , and 23.269 ut .",
    "each of these observations also consisted of twenty 50-second exposures .",
    "for these observations , no astronomical filter was used .      on september  22.781",
    "the tautenburg schmidt telescope began observations of the error box in the johnson @xmath36-band .",
    "this telescope , located at tautenburg , germany , is an f/2 , 1.34-m aperture telescope equipped with a site @xmath32 ccd as the focal plane array .",
    "its field - of - view is @xmath37 .",
    "thirty - eight 120-second exposures were acquired .",
    "the same field was re - observed on october  25 and eight 120-second exposures were acquired . during these exposures ,",

    "the usnofs 1.0-m telescope at flagstaff , arizona , observed the grb010921 area to determine the brightness of the host galaxy in @xmath38 and @xmath39-bands .",
    "the usnofs is an f/7.3 telescope equipped with @xmath40 filters ; its focal plane arrays are a site / tektronix @xmath32 ccd with @xmath41 field - of - view . for these observations , eight 600-second exposures per filter were acquired and coadded .",
    "early observations of the error box of grb  010921 with large aperture telescopes found no evidence of an optical afterglow to the limit of the dposs plates , @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "however , follow - up observations by @xcite resulted in the report of a fading source which displayed the characteristic decay behavior of a grb afterglow .",
    "the coordinates of the suspected afterglow are @xmath43 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "following the reported detection of an optical afterglow candidate , we searched our images for the optical afterglow . in the lotis clear- and @xmath26-band images taken 52  min after the burst we found no optical transient ( ot ) brighter than @xmath44  @xmath45 and @xmath26  @xmath46 .",
    "the shutter for the @xmath25-band camera failed to open . in the second epoch of lotis clear- and @xmath26-band images taken at september 21.417 ut ( 4.75 hours after the burst ) we found no ot to the same limiting magnitude .",
    "analysis of the sdss pt images obtained on september 22 ut reveals the optical afterglow at @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , and gives @xmath49 upper limits of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "analysis of the sdss pt images obtained on september 23 ut reveals the optical afterglow at @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and gives @xmath49 upper limits of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the completeness upper limits are the magnitudes at which the probability of detection is 100% . because of variable extinction over the field due to clouds , the 50% detection limits are more than a magnitude fainter than the completeness limits .",
    "the top panel of figure 1 ( @xmath57 to @xmath58 ) shows the sdss pt images in @xmath28 obtained on september 22 ut of the grb010921 afterglow area ( marked by a circle ) reported by price et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "we searched for the ot in the super - lotis data by co - adding twenty images obtained during each epoch , two epochs per night . in the first co - added image , which was taken on september  22  ut beginning at 22.128  ut , we detect the optical afterglow at @xmath59  @xmath60 at 15  @xmath61 above noise level .",
    "the same analysis applied to the second epoch data ( september  22.267  ut ) detects the optical afterglow at @xmath59  @xmath62 at 12  @xmath61 above the noise level .",
    "panels @xmath63 and @xmath64 of figure  [ fig : images ] show the co - added images with the afterglow indicated by an arrow .",
    "we also searched for an ot in the data set obtained on september  23  ut and find no afterglow to the 10  @xmath61 noise limit of @xmath59  @xmath65 .",
    "the tautenburg data taken on september  22 ut and october  25 ut were co - added to search for the grb  010921 afterglow .",
    "panel @xmath66 of figure  [ fig : images ] show the location of the afterglow indicated by an arrow .",
    "calibrating the afterglow against secondary standards @xcite , the brightness of the afterglow is estimated as @xmath67 .",
    "the host galaxy is marginally detected at the 5  @xmath61 level in the second epoch image ( october 25 ut at 25.770 ) at @xmath68 ( panel @xmath69 of figure  [ fig : images ] ) .",
    "the usnofs deep imaging data was analyzed to obtain the brightness of the host galaxy .",
    "the host galaxy was clearly visible in the coadded image 56 days after the burst and we determine its brightness to be @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the magnitudes and upper limits in the various filters from all the above observations .",
    "we transformed the fluxes measured in various filters to the @xmath25 filter by normalizing a @xmath72 power - law spectrum @xcite to the effective wavelength and flux of each data point , and then plotting the point at the effective wavelength of the @xmath25-band .",
    "this calculated values are listed in the last column of table 1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] shows the resulting light curve of the optical afterglow of grb  010921 .",
    "we fit the data with a power law decay plus a constant host galaxy flux , @xmath73 .",
    "we obtain a best fit decay index of @xmath74 applying a host galaxy magnitude of @xmath75 from the usno measurements performed 56 days after the burst .",
    "this is a typical value for an optical afterglow prior to the jet break , which is predicted to take place @xmath76 130 days after the grb based on the observed energetics of this burst @xcite .",
    "the optical afterglow reported by @xcite was @xmath77 on september 22 and significantly fain.ter on september 23 ( we place a limit on @xmath25 of roughly 20.5 ) .",
    "we attempt to constrain the early - time power law decay by extrapolating the best - fit power - law decay model back to the lotis upper limit of @xmath78 on september  21.256 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] shows that the early - time lotis upper limits are inconsistent with an unchanging decay index from @xmath79  min to @xmath80  h. this may suggest that the optical emission peaked at a magnitude fainter than the lotis limiting magnitude , ( perhaps similar to the afterglow of grb 970508 ) or that the slope changed between the observations , as suggested in the case of grb 991208 @xcite .",
    "complex light curve shapes at very early times have been observed ( e.g. , grb970805 ) and can be explained in terms of a distribution of lorentz factors produced by the central engine @xcite and the complex evolution of multi - component shock emission in a relativistic fireball @xcite .",
    "our early time observations show that afterglow behavior can change quickly within hours after the burst . with rapid localizations we can probe the transition from the prompt emission phase to the subsequent unfolding of the canonical afterglow phase .",
    "grb010921 only provided an upper limit 52 minutes after outburst , but hete-2 triggers should eventually allow us to obtain simultaneous flux measurements .",
    "robotic telescopes like lotis and super - lotis are well suited to finding this early - time emission in response to a near real - time localization of the grb by hete-2 .",
    "support for lotis and super - lotis is provided by nasa ( s-03975 g and s-57797f ) under the auspices of the u. s. department of energy by university of california lawrence livermore national laboratory ( w-7405-eng-48 ) .",
