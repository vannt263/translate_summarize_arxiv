    "understanding the formation and evolution mechanisms of early - type galaxies ( etgs ) remains a crucial challenge in present - day astrophysics . in recent years , high - resolution simulations of galaxy evolution , including both baryons and dark matter ( e.g. *",
    "* ) , have progressed enough that it is finally becoming possible to investigate in detail the physical properties of simulated systems and compare them to the corresponding properties of observed ellipticals in the local universe . whereas nearby etgs have been the object of intense scrutiny , with stellar dynamics being the most often employed diagnostic tool ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , little is known about the detailed structure of ellipticals beyond redshift @xmath0 , despite the obvious importance of providing observational constraints to simulations throughout cosmic history .    at higher redshift , however , massive galaxies occasionally act as strong gravitational lenses : for such systems it becomes possible to supplement stellar kinematics with the lensing constraints to investigate the mass structure of these distant galaxies to a level that is comparable with what can be obtained for nearby objects ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "high quality combined data - sets , including extended kinematics , make it possible to disentangle the contributions of dark and luminous matter to the total mass budget , which in turns allows one to draw inferences also on the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) of the system , by comparing the results with the stellar masses obtained from independent stellar population synthesis ( sps ) analysis assuming a variety of imf profiles .",
    "we demonstrate the power of this approach by applying a self - consistent combined lensing and dynamics analysis to two massive etgs from the xlens survey @xcite for which high signal - to - noise x - shooter spectroscopic observations are at hand .",
    "both massive ellipticals sdssj0936@xmath10913 ( velocity dispersion @xmath2 @xmath3 ; redshift @xmath4 ) and sdssj0912@xmath10029 ( @xmath5 @xmath3 ; @xmath6 ) were first observed as part of the slacs survey @xcite .",
    "the high - resolution images needed for the lensing modelling were obtained with _ hst _",
    "acs through the _ f814w _ filter .",
    "elliptical b - spline models of the lens galaxies were subtracted off the images to isolate the structure of the gravitationally lensed background sources .",
    "high signal - to - noise ( @xmath7 ) _ uvb__vis _ x - shooter spectra are available for both systems , and were used both to carry out sps analysis and derive long - slit spatially resolved stellar kinematics up to about one effective radius , @xmath8 .",
    "a joint self - consistent modelling of all the available lensing and kinematic constraints to derive inferences on the mass and dynamical structure of the two systems is conducted with the fully bayesian cauldron code @xcite .",
    "the lens galaxy is described by a flexible and realistic two - component axisymmetric mass model consisting of ( i ) a generalised navarro - frenk - white ( gnfw ) halo characterised by four free parameters ( the inner density slope  @xmath9 , the axial ratio  @xmath10 , the halo concentration parameter  @xmath11 and the virial velocity  @xmath12 ) and ( ii ) a mass profile for the baryonic component obtained by de - projecting the multi - gaussian expansion fit ( mge ) to the observed surface brightness distribution of the galaxy , characterised by one free parameter ( the total stellar mass  @xmath13 that sets the normalisation of the luminous distribution ) .",
    "the stellar kinematics is modelled with the jeans anisotropic method ( jam ) developed by @xcite , including the meridional plane orbital anisotropy  @xmath14 as a free parameter .",
    "the full inferences on the model parameters obtained from the combined cauldron analysis are expressed as multivariate posterior probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) , encapsulating all the information on the uncertainties in a statistically rigorous way .",
    "the 1d and 2d marginalised posterior pdfs for the individual parameters can be visualised as a familiar corner plot , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cornerplot ] for galaxy j0912 .",
    "both systems are found to be markedly dominated by the baryonic component within the inner  @xmath8 , with a dark matter fraction @xmath15 for j0936 and @xmath16 for the more massive system j0912 .",
    "the dark halo structure of both galaxies ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath3 for j0936 ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath3 for j0912 ) is consistent with the concentration  virial velocity relation predicted from pure @xmath21-body simulations @xcite : thus , within the fairly broad uncertainties , there is no obvious evidence for contraction or expansion of the dark halo in response to galaxy formation .",
    "the inner slope of the dark halo is basically unconstrained for j0936 ( @xmath22 ) , while for j0912 we can conclude that steep slopes are disfavoured ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the two haloes differ in terms of flattening , with j0936 having a more spherical halo ( @xmath24 ) , while the halo of j0912 is clearly oblate ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the two lens galaxies have dissimilar dynamical structures within the probed region : j0936 ( @xmath26 ) is consistent with being a semi - isotropic system , while the velocity dispersion ellipsoid of j0912 is distinctly flattened ( @xmath27 ) .    by comparing the stellar mass inferred from the combined lensing and dynamics modelling with",
    "the one derived from sps analysis of x - shooter spectra we can also put robust constraints on the normalisation of the stellar imf , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : imf ] for j0912 .",
    "we determine that both galaxies are consistent with having a salpeter imf ( i.e. , slope @xmath28 for a power - law imf profile @xmath29 ) , in agreement with the findings for local massive etgs from both spectroscopic and dynamical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , we can rule out both a chabrier and a `` super - salpeter '' ( @xmath30 ) imf with a high degree of confidence .",
    "the xlens data - set makes it possible also to determine the imf in a completely independent way from a spectroscopic simple stellar population analysis of the optical line - strength indices , using the approach outlined by @xcite : the imf slopes obtained with this method ( @xmath31 for j0936 and @xmath32 for j0912 ) are fully consistent with the much tighter lensing and dynamics results .",
    "finally , the constraints from these two complementary approaches can be combined to investigate the elusive low - mass cut - off of the imf , as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "work is ongoing to extend this analysis to the entire xlens sample of  10 massive lens etgs .",
    "the dark cosmology centre is funded by the danish national research foundation ."
