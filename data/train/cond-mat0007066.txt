    "the problem of chaotic wave scattering is of great interest in various branches of physics , like optics , nuclear , mesoscopic and microwave physics .    the study of quantum - mechanical scattering problems whose classical dynamics is chaotic has been further motivated by recent experiments on quantum electronic transport in microstructures consisting of a cavity connected to leads @xcite .",
    "we know that symmetries have very interesting effects on the properties of the electric conductance in mesoscopic systems : time - reversal and spin - rotational symmetries @xcite , as well as spatial - reflection symmetries @xcite have been studied in the literature .",
    "the problem of electronic transport through asymmetric ( as ) chaotic cavities is addressed in detail in ref . in an independent - electron approximation . in that reference ,",
    "the possibility of direct processes due to the presence of short paths is accounted for by specifying the average , or optical , @xmath2 matrix @xmath3 , within an information - theoretic approach .",
    "the statistical distribution for the @xmath2 matrix is known as poisson s kernel , in which @xmath3 enters as a parameter .",
    "when @xmath4 , i.e. in the absence of direct processes , the statistical distribution reduces to the invariant measure for the appropriate universality class .",
    "microstructures with reflection symmetry and a chaotic classical dynamics are studied in refs . and .",
    "the analysis is performed in the absence of direct processes , so that the statistical distribution of the @xmath2 matrix is the invariant measure for the universality class in question and the relevant spatial symmetry : the latter is a symmetry of the _ full _ system under consideration , i.e. the cavity plus the two leads that connect the cavity to the outside .    one purpose of the present paper is to extend the study of refs . and to include the presence of direct processes .",
    "we consider two - dimensional systems with spinless particles and concentrate on left - right ( lr ) symmetry only , i.e. symmetry under reflection through an axis perpendicular to the current .",
    "we also restrict the analysis to time - reversal - invariant ( tri ) problems .",
    "one particular way of inducing direct reflections is by adding potential barriers between the _ symmetrically positioned waveguides _ and the cavity .",
    "if the two barriers are equal , the system is fully lr symmetric ; if the barriers are different , we have a lr - symmetric cavity coupled _ asymmetrically _ to the outside : using the jargon of nuclear physicists @xcite , we shall refer to this type of symmetry breaking as `` external mixing '' , with an obvious meaning .",
    "an interesting question , amenable to experimental observation , is that of the interplay between the symmetry of the cavity and external mixing in the statistical distribution of the conductance of such a structure : the study of that interplay is the second main purpose of this paper . from an experimental point of view microwave cavities @xcite and acoustic systems @xcite might represent good candidates to study these questions",
    ".    that interplay may also be there and have interesting effects when @xmath5 , as in the case of a lr - symmetric cavity coupled to the outside by two waveguides free of potential barriers but _ asymetrically located_. this problem can be addressed from the point of view of the systems described in the previous paragraph in the following way .",
    "one may think of a lr - symmetric cavity coupled to the outside by four waveguides , also placed symmetrically .",
    "we can break the symmetry by providing the two waveguides on the right - hand side of the cavity , say , with identical barriers .",
    "the desired problem is then approached in the limit of impenetrable barriers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in order to make",
    "the paper reasonably self - contained , we summarize in the next section a number of concepts that we shall be using throughout the paper , like the invariant measure and poisson s kernel for @xmath2 matrices and their application to chaotic scattering in as cavities , and the invariant measure for lr - symmetric systems . sec .",

    "the distribution of the conductance is calculated for the particular case of one open channel in each lead and a diagonal optical matrix ( implying direct reflections ) , and contrasted with the one obtained for an as chaotic cavity and the same optical matrix @xmath3 .",
    "different barriers added to the two waveguides of an otherwise fully lr - symmetric system with no direct processes give rise to direct reflections and external mixing : the problem is studied in sec .",
