    "astronomical observations suggest the existence of dark energy which has negative pressure and contributes about 2/3 of the critical density to the total matter density of the universe within the framework of einstein s general relativity @xcite . while a wide variety of dynamical dark energy models were proposed in the literature @xcite , there are also model - independent studies on the nature of dark energy by using the observational data .",
    "in particular , one usually parameterizes dark energy density or the equation of state parameter @xmath0 of dark energy @xcite . for the parametrization of @xmath0",
    ", we need to determine @xmath1 in addition to the parameters in @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , one needs to assume the validity of general relativity in all these studies .",
    "since supernova ( sn ) ia data measures the luminosity distance redshift relationship , it provides a purely kinematic record of the expansion history of the universe .",
    "it is possible to probe the evolution of the hubble parameter or the deceleration parameter by using sn ia data without assuming the nature and evolution of the dark energy @xcite .",
    "for instance , by parameterizing the deceleration parameter @xmath2 , riess _",
    "et al _ @xcite were able to study the kinematics of the universe .",
    "however , it was soon realized that such a parametrization can not re - produce the behavior of the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "an alternative parametrization is a piecewise constant acceleration with two distinct epochs @xcite , for which it was found that sn ia data favors recent acceleration and past deceleration .",
    "recently shapiro and turner ( st ) applied several simple parametrization of the deceleration parameter @xmath3 to the 157 sn ia data @xcite to study the property of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "they found that _ there is little or no evidence that the universe is presently accelerating , and that there is very strong evidence that the universe once accelerated_. the advantage of parameterizing @xmath3 is that the conclusion does not depend on any particular gravitational theory .",
    "the disadvantage is that it will not give much direct information on the cause of an accelerated universe .",
    "the conclusion arrived in @xcite was based on a simple three epoch model of @xmath3 , in which the function @xmath3 is not smooth . since the current sn ia data is still sparse , the division of the data to three different redshift bins may not be a good representation of the data . therefore , the conclusion based on this technique needs to be further studied . following st , we propose a simple smooth function of @xmath3 which we believe is more realistic and then apply the observational data to get the behavior of the deceleration parameter .",
    "after we are sure that the universe experienced acceleration , we assume that the acceleration is due to the presence of dark energy and use a simple dark energy parametrization to study the property of dark energy in the framework of general relativity .    specifically , the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we study the property of @xmath3 by fitting the parametrization @xmath4 to the 157 sn ia data and the 115 nearby sn ia and the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) sn ia data compiled in @xcite . in section iii",
    ", we apply the parametrization @xmath5 to study the property of @xmath3 and the nature of dark energy . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data @xcite",
    "are also combined with the sn ia data in our analysis . in section iv",
    ", we conclude the paper with some discussion .",
    "from the definition of the hubble constant @xmath6 and the deceleration parameter @xmath7 , we have @xmath8d\\ln(1+u)\\right],\\ ] ] where the subscript 0 means the current value of the variable .",
    "so if we are given a function of @xmath3 , then we can find the evolution of our universe without applying any particular theory of gravity .",
    "st considered a simple three - epoch model @xcite @xmath9 by using eq . ( [ hubq ] ) , for the simple three - epoch model we get @xmath10 the parameters in the model are determined by minimizing @xmath11 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2_i},\\ ] ] where the extinction - corrected distance modulus @xmath12 + 25 $ ] , @xmath13 is the total uncertainty in the sn ia data , and the luminosity distance is @xmath14 st found that a long epoch of deceleration is consistent with the 157 gold sample sn ia data at the 10% level , and they concluded that there is little or no evidence that the universe is presently accelerating . although this model is very simple , the functions @xmath3 and @xmath15 take different forms at different epoches .",
    "especially , @xmath16 is not continuous .",
    "because the current sn ia data is still sparse and the decomposition to only three redshift bins is not a good representation , the conclusion derived from the model may not be robust . in this paper",
    ", we would like to use both the 157 gold sample sn ia data and the 115 nearby sn ia and the snls sn ia data compiled in @xcite .",
    "in this 115 data set , there is no sn ia with redshift @xmath17 which is around the redshift @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ qmodl ] ) .",
    "therefore it is not a good idea to fit the simple three - epoch model to the 115 sn ia data , so we proposed a simple two - parameter function @xmath19 to fit the 115 sn ia data .",
    "note that @xmath20 when @xmath21 and @xmath22 , so the parameter @xmath23 gives the value of @xmath24 .",

    "it is also possible that the universe has been accelerating since some time in the past . if @xmath27 and @xmath28 , then it is possible that the universe is decelerating and has past acceleration and deceleration .",
    "in other words , this model may have the same behavior as the simple three - epoch model .",
