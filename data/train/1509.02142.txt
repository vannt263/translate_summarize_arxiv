    "<S> despite the abundance and importance of three - dimensional systems , relatively little progress has been made on spatiotemporal nonlinear optical waves compared to time - only or space - only systems . </S>",
    "<S> here we study radiation emitted by three - dimensionally evolving nonlinear optical waves in multimode fiber . </S>",
    "<S> spatiotemporal oscillations of solitons in the fiber generate multimode dispersive wave sidebands over an ultrabroadband spectral range . </S>",
    "<S> this work suggests routes to multipurpose sources of coherent electromagnetic waves , with unprecedented wavelength coverage .    </S>",
    "<S> eigenmodes are ubiquitous tools for describing complex wave systems . for nonlinear complex wave systems , however , the superposition principle is not applicable . in special cases , </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear wave systems possess solitons , which act to some extent as nonlinear eigenmodes . </S>",
    "<S> combined with more general nonlinear attractors and perhaps insights from linearized systems , researchers may thus build up a conceptual understanding of complex nonlinear wave dynamics . in optics , one - dimensional ( 1d ) dynamics in single - mode waveguides have been thoroughly explored , with many advances hinging on the robust nonlinear attraction of solitons@xcite . in unbounded 3d systems , dynamics have been successfully explained largely in terms of a nonlinearly attracting instability , namely spatial or spatiotemporal collapse@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in reality , the collapse singularity is avoided by a multitude of higher - order effects , and the field eventually expands , by propagating linearly . </S>",
    "<S> post - collapse , promising results have been obtained considering conical waves , which are the eigenmodes of the 3d linear wave equation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although not yet widely adopted , conical wave solutions to the nonlinear wave equation may provide even deeper insight@xcite . given the great advantages the concepts of solitons and collapse have provided in the field of nonlinear optical waves for studying single - mode waveguides and free space filamentation , it is natural to seek similarly useful nonlinear objects in multimode waveguides . </S>",
    "<S> multimode waveguides include as limiting cases single mode ( 1d ) and free - space ( 3d ) , so these hypothetical objects , whether solitons , nonlinearly attracting instabilities , guided conical waves , or something else entirely , could even help to conceptually unify nonlinear optical dynamics across dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> solitons in optical single - mode fiber ( smf ) have been intensely researched , because they are relatively accessible both analytically and experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> equally important , soliton dynamics are critical to telecommunications , mode - locked fiber lasers , and compact white - light sources with high spatial mode quality . </S>",
    "<S> multimode fibers ( mmfs ) could provide major benefits for various applications , from spatial division multiplexing in communications@xcite , to high - power , versatile fiber lasers and white - light sources@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although wave propagation in mmf is still experimentally and theoretically challenging , recent theoretical advances@xcite combined with opportunities for major performance increases provide ample motivation for their study . from a scientific perspective </S>",
    "<S> , mmf is an ideal environment for studying spatiotemporal nonlinear optical dynamics . by judicious design , or by control of the initial excitation </S>",
    "<S> , researchers may control the spatiotemporal characteristics of nonlinear dynamics , through variation of the effective dimensionality , the coupling between modes , or their individual dispersions .    </S>",
    "<S> these factors have motivated recent work on nonlinear optical waves in mmfs@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , control of the spatial excitation of a mmf provides a means of controlling the nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics , and therefore the characteristics of a supercontinuum@xcite . launching @xmath0200-nj and 500-fs pulses at 1550 nm into a graded - index ( grin ) mmf produces remarkable visible light emission characterized by a series of spectral peaks with non - uniform spacing . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations confirm these peaks , and suggest that even more spectacular emission occurs at long wavelengths , where fused silica is effectively opaque ( figure 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are puzzling and fascinating : some novel nonlinear optical mechanism , unidentified by prior fiber - based or bulk supercontinuum research , generates and links electromagnetic radiation over 2 orders of magnitude in wavelength ( from @xmath1 50 to @xmath2 0.5 @xmath3 m ) .        here </S>",
    "<S> we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon : dispersive waves are generated by the spatiotemporal oscillation of multimode solitons . </S>",
    "<S> the process is inherently 3d , with spatiotemporally - evolving nonlinear waves emitting spatiotemporally - evolving dispersive waves . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show that insights from solitons of the 1d nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nse ) , can prove useful in understanding the higher - dimensional system . </S>",
    "<S> this understanding also suggests routes to generating ultrashort pulses in fiber at wavelengths outside current capabilities , and may provide a means of interfacing normally distinct parts of the electromagnetic spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> solitons are solutions to a conservative equation . to use them in applications such as mode - locked lasers and optical telecommunications@xcite , loss must be compensated . </S>",
    "<S> this is naturally accomplished by laser gain , or by amplifiers placed throughout the line . </S>",
    "<S> the periodic perturbations of gain and loss , however , can destabilize a soliton . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the instability , and the characteristic spectral sidebands that are its signature , is the fact that a periodic perturbation can phase - match dispersive wave emission at particular frequencies@xcite . for a perturbation period ( spacing of amplifiers , or laser cavity length ) @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , the phase - matching condition is approximately : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an integer , and @xmath7 is the wavevector of the dispersive wave . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 is the soliton wavevector , which in the absence of higher - order dispersion is equal to @xmath9,where @xmath10 is the group velocity dispersion , @xmath11 is the soliton duration and @xmath12 is the soliton period . </S>",
    "<S> this quasi - phase matching leads to resonant emission at frequencies separated from the pump by @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result was later refined to include the third - order dispersion of the fiber@xcite , where resonant frequencies were found to be roots of the equation : @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the third - order dispersion ) and @xmath17 is the angular frequency separation from the pump ( in units of @xmath18 ) . </S>",
    "<S> production of dispersive waves is the primary limitation to the performance of soliton fiber lasers .    </S>",
    "<S> although they were predicted as early as the 1980s@xcite , solitons consisting of pulses within multiple spatial modes have only recently been studied experimentally@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> initial work shows that solitary waves , termed mm solitons , can be excited in multimode graded - index ( grin ) fibers . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to single - mode solitons , these pulses resist group - velocity dispersion and adjust themselves adiabatically in response to perturbations such as intrapulse raman scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior makes them a useful conceptual tool for understanding complex nonlinear processes beyond the nse description , such as those involved in supercontinuum generation@xcite . unlike single - mode solitons </S>",
    "<S> however , mm solitons additionally resist modal velocity dispersion - _ i.e. _ , the fact that each of the numerous consitutent modes of the soliton has a different group velocity . </S>",
    "<S> fission of mm solitons is spatiotemporal : it yields multiple mm solitons which can have many different modal distributions . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , mm solitons can have a bewildering range of spatiotemporal shapes , which makes their dynamics much richer and challenging than single - mode solitons . while they are in some sense natural extensions of the 1d nse soliton to the case of a mm fiber , they probably do not fulfill the most rigorous definitions of @xmath19soliton@xmath19 ( some special cases are already known , however@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> questions such as whether they are stable over very long distances , how they interact with one another , and how many modes can be involved , remain largely unanswered .    </S>",
    "<S> when a beam excites multiple modes of a grin fiber , it propagates through the fiber with a characteristic spatial oscillation with period ( pitch ) @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the core radius and @xmath22 is the core - cladding index difference@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this oscillation causes the intensity of the beam to periodically evolve , as in a loss - managed soliton transmission line or soliton fiber laser . for a pulsed beam </S>",
    "<S> , oscillations will only occur as long as the pulses in each mode maintain co - localization and a phase relationship@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a soliton containing multiple spatial modes experiences a periodic oscillation of its peak intensity and therefore is likely to emit dispersive radiation at particular frequencies depending on the period of the oscillation .    </S>",
    "<S> m. these dynamics are also shown in supplementary movies 1 and 2 , which provide a considerably more complete representation of the complex spatiotemporal evolution . ]     as in text,1d nee simulations , and an experimental example spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> b. functions used in the quasi-1d approximation , along with the peak intensity variation of the field in mmgnlse simulation . </S>",
    "<S> c.comparison of the periodic 1d phase - matching model with multimode simulations by the gmmnlse and experiments in grin mmfs . </S>",
    "<S> continuous curves are values of @xmath6 in eq . 3 , plotted with the best - fit parameter values . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a simulation using the generalized multimode nonlinear schrdinger equation ( gmmnlse)@xcite , with the first five radially - symmetric modes excited uniformly for simplicity ( figure 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> experiments are conducted with the procedures described in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in both simulation and experiment </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the soliton oscillation - induced dispersive waves ( odws ) are observed for many different initial spatial conditions , including non - radially - symmetric excitations . </S>",
    "<S> typically we observe that the odws are more apparent when the intensity of the initial pulse is higher ( either by large energy , tight spatial localization , or both ) . changing the initial noise level or the pulse duration results in different dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , provided the pulse energy and fiber length are sufficient , and that multiple modes are excited , the qualitative features ( including the spectral positions ) of the odw emission process are similar . in simulations , we observe that the energy of each odw is distributed roughly equally among all the modes , with the red - shifted ( blue - shifted ) sidebands exhibiting a slight preference for the low - order ( higher - order ) modes .    </S>",
    "<S> representative simulation results for a 400-fs , 1550-nm mm pulse with energy 164 nj launched into a grin mmf are shown in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the results are also shown as supplementary movies 1 and 2 . ) </S>",
    "<S> the spatial and temporal breathing of the field are evident in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a . </S>",
    "<S> while we show only the blue - shifted odws ( figure 2b ) , the simulation also predicts red - shifted odws . </S>",
    "<S> these are remarkably outside the transparency window of fused silica ( the first appears at roughly 72 thz ( 4200 nm ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the pulse traverses the fiber , the spectrum develops a dispersive wave near 300 thz ( 1000 nm ) , as well as odws in the visible and mid - ir regimes . </S>",
    "<S> attenuation is included in the simulations with an assumed frequency dependence @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the attenuation ( units m@xmath25 ) at 1550 nm , and @xmath26 phz ( @xmath0 80 nm ) models the increasing loss into the infrared . </S>",
    "<S> for these parameters , attenuation is @xmath0 0.1 mdb / km at 4200 nm . </S>",
    "<S> we neglect loss above the 1550-nm base level on the blue side of the spectrum . despite this enormous loss , </S>",
    "<S> appreciable energy is still produced in the mid - ir odws . </S>",
    "<S> this is partly due to the relatively short length of the fiber ( 150 periods correspond to only @xmath0 6 cm ) , and to the enormous gain the odws experience ( relative to the initial continuum level ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy in each odw may grow superexponentially , with the first blueshifted ( redshifted ) odw experiencing roughly 70 db ( 50 db ) net gain in 1 cm ( figure 2c ) . </S>",
    "<S> after about 100 oscillation periods the odw energy in each spectral band saturates to a nearly constant value . </S>",
    "<S> the observed superexponential growth and subsequent saturation of the odw energy is in qualitative agreement with the analytical prediction of the soliton perturbation theory that was developed to describe large - amplitude soliton intensity oscillations in periodically amplified transmission links@xcite . on the other hand , for small amplitude oscillations of the soliton , </S>",
    "<S> the theory only predicts a linear growth of the odw with distance@xcite .    to verify that the oscillations underly the odws , we add oscillations artificially to a single - mode nse . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by making the nonlinear coefficient a periodic function of the longitudinal coordinate , so that the pulse evolution equation is    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the pulse envelope , and @xmath29 is the @xmath30-dependent nonlinear coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 compares the result of solving this equation to the results above found using the gmmnlse , and with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3a shows the solution of equation 4 with the indicated form of @xmath29 . due to the sinusoidal oscillation of the beam radius , </S>",
    "<S> one expects an accurate @xmath29 to be of the form @xmath31+r_{mean}\\sin{(2\\pi z / p)})^2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we use the rms widths for @xmath32 and @xmath33 here , and rescale @xmath34 appropriately , since the usual spatial width measurement ( mode field diameter ) is not well - defined for the complex spatiotemporal fields that occur . at the onset of the odw generation ( @xmath0 145 - 155 periods ) , @xmath35 14.5 @xmath3 m and @xmath36 5.2 @xmath3 m , so that @xmath37 ( 1db , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observed intensity oscillations of the mmf field ( mmgnlse , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) are approximated better by @xmath38 ( space@xmath39time fit , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the mm soliton s duration also oscillates : the soliton tends to lengthen when its spatial width increases and shorten when its spatial width decreases ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a and inset , supplementary movie 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is this spatiotemporal oscillation that generates the odws .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental peak locations are consistent with simulation and analytic theory . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3c shows the results of fitting the experimentally - measured and simulated peak locations with the roots of eq . 3 for various @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> for the experimental ( simulated ) peaks , fitting yields @xmath10 = -26 ( -25 ) fs@xmath40/mm , and @xmath16=143 ( 143 ) fs@xmath41/mm . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the peaks are fit by the simple theoretical approximation well , with the discrepancy attributed to the slightly different dispersion characteristics of the real and simulated fibers . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal values are near the simulation parameters , except that the optimal @xmath10 is greater by 16% , which suggests that modal dispersion makes an effective contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> although the measured odw positions are well - described , their amplitudes can vary due to several effects beyond both the simulations and analytic approach . </S>",
    "<S> first , due to the presence of many modes in the fiber , phase - matched intramodal four - wave mixing ( fwm ) may occur involving the 1550-nm pump , its primary dispersive wave at 800 - 1000 nm , various odws , and raman - shifted mm solitons . </S>",
    "<S> for the low - order odws in particular , we note that there are several energy - conserving fwm processes . </S>",
    "<S> these may amplify red - shifted odws at the expense of specific blue - shifted odws . particularly in the presence of many modes </S>",
    "<S> , intramodal fwm can be a complex process@xcite , particularly when cascaded mixing is considered@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is probably why , for certain initial spatial conditions , various low - order blueshifted odws are attenuated or even invisible experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained the peak locations in figure 3c from experiments with multiple initial conditions , in order to account for low - order blue - shifted odws that were attenuated for any given intial condition . </S>",
    "<S> second , because the spacing of the odws is quite close to the raman bandwidth of fused silica , certain odws may experience raman gain from one another and from the third - harmonic light ( thg : its efficiency may also benefit from intramodal phase - matching ) . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , the dynamic range and spectral resolution of the spectrometer limits the visibility of low - amplitude features , and broadens narrow spectral features .    </S>",
    "<S> another remaining mystery is the relatively high amplitude of the odws observed in experiments , compared to simulations . </S>",
    "<S> intramodal fwm may play some role , as well as larger oscillations and thg . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3a shows the spectrum obtained by solving the 1d nonlinear envelope equation ( nee ) with @xmath42 , including self - steepening and assuming averaging of the oscillating raman integral@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> larger oscillations produce relatively more intense dispersive waves , because the soliton is more strongly perturbed . </S>",
    "<S> larger oscillations occur when more modes are coherently locked together@xcite , and as the experiment contains much more than 5 modes , we choose a functional form of @xmath29 to model this . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , thg provides an initial seed in the visible , leading to significantly enhanced resonant emission at nearby wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> periodic backconversion occurs for frequencies near @xmath43 , so the largest enhancement is for slightly smaller frequencies .    </S>",
    "<S> the odws generated by soliton resonances in mmf have relevance to applications . </S>",
    "<S> for example , by filtering the first redshifted or blueshifted odw , one may generate pulses in wavelength regions well outside the gain spectrum of available fiber dopants . </S>",
    "<S> tuning may be achieved by changing the pump wavelength or fiber pitch . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , because the modulation instability gain spectrum of a cw field at the pump wavelength overlaps with the soliton sidebands@xcite , filtered odws could be parametrically amplified ( using either the circulating pump pulse or an injected cw field ) provided some mechanism was introduced to compensate for the chromatic walk - off between the pump and odw fields . odws spaced over a very broad wavelength range are generated coherently from the optical pump pulse . given the remarkable range and coherence , spatiotemporal soliton oscillation may provide a means of generating synchronized ultrashort pulses in different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum . in an appropriate waveguide , an optically - derived coherent connection between microwave , deep ultraviolet and optical frequencies may be possible .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the spatiotemporal oscillation of nonlinear waves in grin multimode fiber causes the generation of their spatiotemporal dispersive waves . </S>",
    "<S> these dispersive waves can be described relatively well by simulations using the gmmnlse , and insight can be gained by approximating the dynamics in a quasi-1d model with a longitudinally - varying nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> future work , involving more advanced models and experimental methods , can answer a few of the open mysteries about this process , including verification of these hypotheses , the spatiotemporal dynamics leading to the multimode supercontinuum , and the spatiotemporal structure of the dispersive waves . </S>",
    "<S> this work illustrates valuable conceptual connections between 1d and the intermediate dimensional system of the grin mmf . </S>",
    "<S> practically , it provides a route to fiber - based ultrashort pulse sources with tunable wavelengths far outside the range of any current fiber - optic technique . </S>"
