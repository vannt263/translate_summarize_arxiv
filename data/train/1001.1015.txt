    "a leftmoving piston , impacting a fluid with velocity @xmath0 , generates a leftmoving shockwave with velocity @xmath1 . throughout this paper",
    "we analyze such a shockwave from the viewpoint of a coordinate system moving leftward , so as to keep pace with the shock .",
    "see figures 1 and 2 . in this special uniformly - translating coordinate frame",
    "the shockwave is stationary , simplifying theoretical analyses .",
    "one - dimensional stationary shockwaves@xcite provide a useful computational laboratory for the study of stationary far - from - equilibrium states .",
    "in such a shockwave a cold fluid is converted irreversibly to a hot one . as the fluid moves from left to right , in the shock - centered coordinate frame of the figures , at speed @xmath2 , the @xmath3 coordinate increases ; typically , the corresponding density , the longitudinal component of the pressure tensor , and the energy all increase too , in just such a way that the spatial structure of the wave is stationary : @xmath4 @xmath5 as the velocity decreases from its leftmost entrance value , @xmath6 , to its rightmost exit value , @xmath7 , the stationary nature of the wave requires that the fluxes of mass , momentum , and energy remain constant throughout : @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10_x + q_x = \\ ] ] @xmath11_{\\rm cold } =   ( \\rho u)[e+(p/\\rho)+(u^2/2)]_{\\rm hot } \\ .\\ ] ] the notation here is conventional , with the pressure tensor @xmath12 and heat flux vector @xmath13 assumed to be calculable from the density @xmath14 , velocity @xmath15 , energy @xmath16 , and their gradients .",
    "temperature@xcite is our special interest in this work .",
    "temperature is most simply and usefully defined as a velocity fluctuation , the `` kinetic temperature '' : @xmath17 the angular brackets imply a local average .",
    "the velocities here are individual particle velocities , whose local average would be the hydrodynamic flow velocity @xmath15 .",
    "temperature is just the fluctuation about this average .",
    "it is evident that @xmath18 and @xmath19 can differ . in dilute - gas kinetic theory , the difference corresponds to a shear stress : @xmath20 } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath22 is the particle mass , which we choose equal to unity in what follows . in dense fluids",
    "there is no simple relationship between the two tensors so that special evolution equations for @xmath18 and @xmath19 need to be developed , as we do in section iii .",
    "the cold fluid , initially moving to the right at the entrance velocity , or `` shock velocity '' @xmath23 , is slowed by its encounter with the wave until it reaches its exit velocity @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the `` piston velocity '' or `` particle velocity '' . in this irreversible deceleration the kinetic energy lost by the decelerating fluid is converted into additional hot fluid enthalpy @xmath26 : @xmath27_{\\rm hot}-[e + ( p/\\rho)]_{\\rm cold } = [ \\rho_{\\rm cold } u_s^2/2 ] - [ \\rho_{\\rm hot } ( u_s - u_p)^2/2 ] \\ .\\ ] ] the cold and hot boundary conditions enclosing the shock are equilibrium ones imposed far from the shockfront so that the small - system surface effects complicating the number - dependence of nonequilibrium systems are minimized . in implementing these ideas",
    "no arbitrary or artificial assumptions have to be made .",
    "all the observed phenomena follow from the assumed form for the interparticle forces .",
    "figures 3 , 4 , and 5 show typical results from molecular dynamics , as is described in more detail in section ii .",
    "notice that the rise in longitudinal temperature @xmath18 can be much larger and can occur somewhat earlier@xcite than that of the transverse temperature @xmath19 .    in section iii we discuss the _ continuum _ mechanics of the same shockwave problem .",
    "evidently _ any _ continuum formulation must first of all include the continuum conservation laws for mass , momentum , and energy : @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 here the pressure tensor @xmath12 and heat flux vector @xmath13 measure the momentum and energy fluxes in the local `` comoving '' ( or `` lagrangian '' ) coordinate frame moving with the mean velocity @xmath2 .",
    "now the superior dot notation is used to indicate the time derivatives of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 following the motion at velocity @xmath15 . in the continuum description",
    "these field variables are continuous differentiable functions of space and time so that the spatial averaging ( necessary to an analysis of molecular dynamics data ) is unnecessary .",
    "the steady nature of the shock process makes it possible to use either space or time as an independent variable . on the average , the progress of a particle traveling through the shockwave follows from the integral of the flow velocity . to illustrate , consider again the molecular dynamics profiles shown in figures 3 , with space as the abscissa .",
    "exactly the same profiles can alternatively be expressed with time as the abscissa , as in figure 5 . to change from space - based to time - based profiles",
    "requires use of the ratio @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath2 is the hydrodynamic flow velocity .",
    "thus all the spatial snapshots or equivalent temporal wave profiles catalog the sequence of time - ordered states through which the particles in a typical volume ( initially at @xmath33 ) pass as they transit the shockwave .",
    "because the conventional navier - stokes - fourier approach , illustrated in figure 6 , assumes a scalar temperature , @xmath34 , several modifications of the continuum description need to be made to model the two - temperature results of figures 3 - 5 found with molecular dynamics , with @xmath35 . in section",
    "iii we describe simple modifications of the navier - stokes - fourier constitutive and flow equations , along with a numerical method which converges nicely to give stationary shockwave profiles in the two - temperature case .",
    "section iv is reserved for a summary and our concluding remarks , including suggestionns for adapting our ideas to detailed two- and three - dimensional descriptions of the fluctuations in nonequilibrium systems .",
    "the molecular dynamics simulations leading to our current results are all based on a very simple model two - dimensional system of unit - mass unit - radius particles interacting pairwise with a short - ranged normalized repulsive potential@xcite : @xmath36 the length and energy scales set by this potential correspond to the range and strength of the interparticle pair forces .",
    "the equilibrium properties for this potential can be approximated very roughly by a theoretical model ( based on a random distribution of particles in space ) resembling van der waals mean - field idea , @xmath37 @xmath12 , @xmath14 , @xmath16 , and @xmath38 are the pressure , density , energy , and temperature . though the models and language here all refer to systems in two space dimensions the same ideas can be applied equally well to three - dimensional systems .",
    "we expect that the nonequilibrium properties for this model will likewise provide a simple interpretation .",
    "we are particularly interested here in generalizing the notion of temperature to the tensor case , @xmath35 . the need for this generalization stems from the molecular dynamics shockwave simulations summarized in figures 3 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "stationary shockwaves were obtained from molecular dynamics by matching the mass flux of a cold stress - free lattice ( @xmath39 and speed 1.930 ) to the mass flux of the hot fluid exiting at the righthand boundary ( with @xmath40 and speed 0.965 ) : @xmath41 with this choice for the shockwave speed @xmath42 and particle ( or piston ) speed @xmath43 the shockwave is stationary and corresponds to twofold compression , a `` strong '' shockwave@xcite . the mach number @xmath44 is not a useful description here as the sound speed @xmath45 vanishes in the cold state .",
    "the momentum and energy fluxes throughout the wave are equal to those of the initial cold lattice : @xmath46 @xmath47 + q_x =   \\sqrt{4/3}(1.93)^3/2 = 4.151 \\ .\\ ] ]    spatial averages within the shockwave were calculated here using lucy s weight function@xcite , @xmath48 \\ ; \\",
    "|x|/h < 1 \\ , \\ ] ] with a range equal to three times the range of the potential , @xmath49",
    ". the internal energy at a gridpoint coordinate @xmath3 , for example , is computed as a ratio of sums : @xmath50 where the energy of particle @xmath51 is the sum of its kinetic energy relative to the local flow velocity @xmath2 plus half its summed - up interaction energy with other nearby particles @xmath52 .",
    "consider now the results shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the density , energy , and pressure agree roughly with the hyperbolic - tangent profiles derived by landau and lifshitz for a weak shockwave with constant transport coefficients@xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows the pressure - temperature - volume states through which the moving fluid travels .",
    "the rayleigh line , a straightline relation linking @xmath53 and the volume , is necessarily satisfied and corresponds to the conservation of momentum . in marked contrast",
    ", the molecular dynamics temperature shows a strong maximum ( as might be expected from the mixing of cold and hot gaussian distributions suggested by mott - smith@xcite ) at the shockfront .",
    "because the work done in compressing the fluid appears first in the longitudinal direction we expect that the rise in @xmath18 precedes that of @xmath19 , as is confirmed in figure 3 .",
    "this thermal anisotropicity differs from the conventional textbook result and is the main motivation for our work on a two - temperature continuum description , detailed in the following section .",
    "continuum models combine the universal conservation laws ( mass , momentum , and energy ) and the corresponding evolution equations ( continuity , motion , and energy ) with specific constitutive models .",
    "the constitutive models describe the pressure tensor and the heat flux vector for nonequilibrium systems .",
    "the usual navier - stokes assumptions , which we follow here for a two - dimensional fluid , are that the pressure tensor and heat flux vector respond linearly to velocity and temperature gradients : @xmath54i - \\eta [ \\nabla u + \\nabla u^t ] \\ ; \\ \\lambda \\equiv \\eta _ v - \\eta \\ .\\ ] ] @xmath55 it needs to be emphasized that the choice of particular expansion variables , here @xmath56 and @xmath57 , affects the solutions of nonlinear problems like shockwave structure .",
    "garca - coln and green emphasized that the description of nonequilibrium continuum mechanics is ambiguous whenever the choice of `` equilibrium '' variables  energy or longitudinal temperature or transverse temperature in this case ",
    "is ambiguous@xcite .",
    "the numerical value of a taylor s series in the deviations from equilibrium , truncated after the first nonlinear term , is clearly sensitive to the choice of independent variable .    in the nonequilibrium pressure tensor",
    "the superscript @xmath58 indicates the transposed tensor and @xmath59 is the unit tensor : @xmath60 @xmath61 is the shear viscosity , and @xmath62 is defined by the bulk viscosity @xmath63 . in the shockwave problem",
    "the pressure - tensor definitions give @xmath64 for a two - temperature continuum model it is necessary to formulate the `` equilibrium pressure '' @xmath65 as a function of the ( nonequilibrium ) energy , density , and the two temperatures .",
    "the viscosities and conductivity could likewise depend upon these state variables and @xmath66 can be a tensor , as we show later , with an example .",
    "when we define @xmath18 and @xmath19 as continuum state variables it becomes necessary for us to formulate constitutive relations for their evolution .",
    "the simplest such models begin by separating the energy into two parts : a density - dependent `` cold curve '' @xmath67 and an additional kinetic or `` thermal '' part , proportional to temperature : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a scalar heat capacity .",
    "the functional form of the cold curve produces a corresponding contribution to the pressure : @xmath70 grneisen s @xmath71 defines a corresponding thermal pressure : @xmath72 the viscous part of the pressure tensor is newtonian : @xmath73    the thermal and viscous parts of the first - law energy change are then apportioned between the @xmath3 and @xmath74 directions so as to be consistent with overall energy conservation : @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 the thermal relaxation time @xmath78 has been introduced in the evolution equations to guarantee thermal equilibrium far from the shockwave : @xmath79    in what follows we consider two models for the cold curve and the heat capacity .",
    "first , a weak repulsive pair force suggests implementing a `` van der waals model '' : @xmath80 second , a triangular - lattice - based model , based on grneisen s ideas , uses the nearest - neighbor static lattice energy and pressure corresponding to the pair potential evaluated at the nearest - neighbor lattice spacing @xmath81 , @xmath82 : @xmath83 @xmath84 the corresponding equilibrium equation of state separates the energy and pressure into `` cold '' and `` thermal '' parts : @xmath85 with @xmath71 chosen so as to roughly reproduce equation of state data from molecular dynamics .",
    "let us next apply these two simple cold - curve models to the shockwave problem .",
    "first consider an arbitrary , but simple and natural , choice : @xmath86 @xmath87 with an initial density of unity and an initial temperature of zero .",
    "twofold compression of the cold van der waals fluid gives the following solution relating the initial and final equilibrium states : @xmath88 the mass , momentum , and energy fluxes connecting these states must be constant throughout the profile : @xmath89 + q_x   = 6 \\ .\\ ] ]    consider the most extreme anisotropic situation consistent with energy conservation , in which all the work done and heat transfered are associated with thermal change in the @xmath3 direction .",
    "the thermal relaxation time @xmath78 , here chosen equal to unity , guarantees that the @xmath3 and @xmath74 temperatures equilibrate in a time of order @xmath78 : @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 two solutions of these equations appear in figures 7 and 8 . for both of them we chose a shear viscosity of unity and a vanishing bulk viscosity : @xmath93    the heat flux vector requires that an additional choice be made for its response to the gradients of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we compare two choices in figures 7 and 8 . for both of them",
    "the overall conductivity is unity , but the heat flux responds differently to the two components of @xmath57 : @xmath94 \\ .\\ ] ] @xmath95 \\ ; \\ ] ]    it is good fortune that the shockwave equations we summarize here are relatively easy to solve numerically .",
    "the usual numerical method is the `` backward euler '' scheme@xcite .",
    "one starts near the `` hot '' boundary and integrates backward , using a first - order difference scheme .",
    "that approach fails here , due to the temperature relaxation terms , which are exponentially unstable in the time - reversed case .",
    "an integration forward in time is required in the presence of relaxation .",
    "a successful `` staggered - grid '' ( two separate spatial grids ) algorithm results if the density @xmath96 is defined at cell centers and energy , temperature , and pressure are defined at the nodes which bound the cells@xcite .",
    "this algorithm follows the dynamics correctly and converges nicely to the stationary profiles shown in figures 7 and 8 .",
    "a computational mesh spacing of @xmath97 is sufficient , using the second - order spatial differencing scheme outlined in references 18 and 19 with fourth - order runge - kutta time integration .    in the early days of shockwave modeling this computational simplicity was by no means apparent , so that there is an abundant literature on the stability of numerical methods for the shockwave problem@xcite .",
    "now , in the early days of tensor - temperature models , the main challenge is to develop well - posed constitutive equations consistent with both the conservation laws and the empirical results from molecular dynamics .",
    "interesting aspects of both solutions are ( i ) the minimum in @xmath98 , which suggests the need for bulk viscosity in modeling molecular dynamics results , and ( ii ) the pronounced maximum in @xmath99 , leading the response of @xmath19 and roughly equal in magnitude to that found in the dynamical results of section ii .",
    "the physical ideas incorporated in this simplest approach are four : ( i ) the pressure and the work done can usefully be separated into a `` cold '' part and a `` thermal '' part ; ( ii ) the heat flux @xmath13 responds to a linear combination of the temperature gradients @xmath100 and @xmath101 in the usual way , supplemented by ( iii ) the thermal relaxation of the thermal anisotropicity , and ( iv ) separate linear combinations of the work done and heat absorbed contribute to @xmath18 and @xmath19 throughout the shock compression process .    here the total pressure , @xmath102 , contains potential and kinetic components , measurable separately with molecular dynamics .",
    "these extensions of the navier - stokes approach closely parallel the relaxation - time treatments of strong ideal - gas shockwaves carried out by xu , josyula , holian , and mareschal@xcite .",
    "our more general approach necessarily differs from theirs by allowing for contributions from the potential energy to temperature changes and the transfer of heat .",
    "the pressure profiles shown in figures 7 and 8 also indicate the need for bulk viscosity , in that the molecular dynamics results show a monotone - increasing @xmath103 , in contrast to the distinct minimum found here in the absence of bulk viscosity .",
    "we turn next to a slightly more sophisticated model , an extension of grneisen s equilibrium equation of state",
    ".      for gases , where the pressure and temperature tensors are proportional to one another , a systematic expansion of the boltzmann equation can be , and has been , tried@xcite .",
    "xu and josyula@xcite as well as holian and mareschal@xcite developed solutions of generalized relaxation - time boltzmann equations for the shockwave problem .",
    "for dense fluids only enskog s hard - sphere - based theory is available .",
    "more flexible empirical models need to be developed for dense - fluid shockwaves . a trial set of two - temperature evolution equations , the simplest plausible set generalizing the van der waals model above , makes use of grneisen s `` cold curve '' representation of the energy and pressure to define `` thermal '' contributions .",
    "these thermal parts include both the effects of thermal agitation ( heat and temperature ) and of mechanical distortion ( work , through compression with viscous deformation ) : @xmath104    for the molecular dynamics simulations discussed in section ii the cold parts of the pressure and energy , as well as their time dependence , are naturally defined by imagining a perfect static triangular lattice of particles : @xmath105 @xmath106 here @xmath81 is the separation of the six nearest neighbors in a cold triangular lattice , so that @xmath107 .    just as in the equilibrium grneisen model the thermal energy and the nonviscous part of the thermal pressure",
    "are taken to be proportional to temperature : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is grneisen s constant and @xmath69 is a heat capacity .",
    "the krook - boltzmann relaxation terms , with relaxation time @xmath110 , are the simplest means for guaranteeing thermal equilibrium , with the two temperatures approaching one another far from the shockfront .    because molecular dynamics simulations indicate that temperature becomes a tensor in strong shockwaves , a tentative two - temperature formulation can be based on separating the internal energy and the pressure into the three components suggested by classical statistical mechanics , including newtonian shear and bulk viscosities : @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 \\ { \\rm or } \\",

    "\\rho[\\phi^{\\rm cold } + \\gamma ck(t_{xx } + t_{yy})/2 ] \\ ; \\ ] ] @xmath114    the sum of the three energy evolution equations just given is designed to reproduce the usual first law energy equation , @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the comoving rates at which heat enters the fluid and at which the fluid performs work on its surroundings .",
    "the constitutive relations for @xmath12 and @xmath13 must also be given .",
    "for a two - dimensional newtonian fluid with shear viscosity @xmath61 and bulk viscosity @xmath63 we have @xmath118 the heat flux is given by a generalization of fourier s law , with independent contributions from @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "additional generalizations of this approach can be developed as needed to describe results from simulations .",
    "it is only required that any such model satisfy energy conservation and reduce to the navier - stokes - fourier model in the weak - shock limit . to illustrate the possibilities , compare the molecular dynamics results of figure 3 to the model calculations of figure 9 . in figure 9 the relaxation time",
    "has been increased to 3 , the heat capacity doubled , to @xmath119 , and the heat conductivity set equal to 6 so as to better match the empirical results of molecular dynamics .",
    "the value of grneisen s @xmath71 is 0.3 , and the bulk and shear viscosities are both equal to unity .",
    "the results from these choices ( which are by no means optimized ) resemble the shockwave profiles obtained with molecular dynamics .",
    "we have shown here that it is relatively easy to model the thermal anisotropicity found in atomistic simulations of strong shockwaves .",
    "thermal relaxation , bulk viscosity , and grneisen equations of state are useful components of a kinetic shockwave model . by apportioning the longitudinal and transverse thermal portions of the work , heat , and heat flux vector a variety of useful models",
    "can be developed and used to reproduce results from simulations .",
    "a forward - in - time fourth - order runge - kutta ( as opposed to backward euler ) integration of the cell and nodal motion equations results in accurate and stable continuum dynamics .",
    "one of the recent observations from molecular dynamics is that the stress and heat flux lag somewhat behind the strainrate and the temperature gradient@xcite .",
    "it is desirable that models be generalized to reflect these lags .",
    "some study of time - delayed differential equations is necessary to model this phenomenon .",
    "a significant goal is the extension of these same ideas to the fluctuating stress and heat flows of two and three dimensional fluids .",
    "a comparison of results from molecular dynamics with those from two and three - dimensional two - temperature continuum simulations should provide useful tools for describing fluctuations within the overall one - dimensional flows .",
    "these results show that even far - from - equilibrium shocks can be treated in a semiquantitative way by relating the tensor parts of the energy flows to one another in a relatively simple way",
    ". an intriguing result of some model calculations is the stable reversal of the direction of the heat flux vector .",
    "though this reversal seems unphysical , there is no difficulty in obtaining stable numerical profiles which include flux reversal .",
    "the thermodynamic irreversibility of the shockwave process has an interest independent of the definition of temperature and is worth futher study .",
    "the shock process itself obeys purely hamiltonian mechanics , and liouville s theorem@xcite .",
    "even so , by using levesque and verlet s integer version of the leapfrog algorithm@xcite the entire shockwave dynamics can be precisely reversed , to the very last bit .",
    "the apparent paradox , a perfectly time - reversible but thermodynamically irreversible process , can most clearly be illustrated by simulating the ( inelastic ) collision of two zero - pressure blocks of fluid .",
    "the collision of the blocks , with velocities @xmath120 generates two shockwaves , with velocities @xmath121 .",
    "two snapshots from such a simulation are shown in figure 10 .",
