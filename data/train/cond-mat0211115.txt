    "the achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in alkali gases@xcite was a remarkable feat in atomic and low - temperature physics . the gases are most often trapped magnetically in potentials accurately approximated by harmonic oscillator wells .",
    "the result has been a deluge of theoretical papers on bec in harmonic potentials , both for ideal and interacting gases.@xcite experimentally , the gases are sufficiently dilute and weakly interacting that the ideal gas is a good first approximation for their description , making the subject more accessible to students even in their first statistical - physics course .",
    "a basic problem with the standard presentation of bec is that the grand canonical ensemble misrepresents several physical quatities when a condensate is present .",
    "for example , grand canonical ensemble calculations greatly overestimate the fluctuations of the condensate number .",
    "although , because of their isolation , the most realistic description of the experimentally condensed gases is via the microcanonical ensemble , the canonical ensemble gives equally accurate results . in the latter",
    "the system of interest is in contact with a heat bath but the particle number is kept fixed , which is crucial .",
    "calculations using the canonical ensemble are avoided in most elementary treatments of bec because of mathematical complications .",
    "the grand canonical ensemble removes these complications by putting the system in contact with a particle bath .",
    "unfortunately , when there is a condensate , the de broglie wavelength can be larger than the system size , making the distinction between system and bath meaningless and leading to the fluctuation inaccuracy mentioned .",
    "moreover , the trapped bose systems of current interest consist of relatively few particles . there exist simple methods using recurrence relations that have been exploited often in recent work to treat finite systems in the canonical ensemble ; however , these relations are not well known outside the research literature .",
    "it is these techniques that we want to discuss here .    because the experimental trapped systems are finite , they are not equivalent to systems in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the trapped systems have a nonuniform distribution established by the external harmonic potential .",
    "the true thermodynamic limit in these systems would require that as the particle number @xmath0 is increased , we also would decrease the frequency @xmath1 of the potential in such a way that the maximum density  proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the spatial dimension of the system  remains constant.@xcite although this limit is not physically realized and finite systems have no real phase transitions , the experimental transformation of the system into its lowest state is still rather sudden .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of a mathematically sharp phase transition is not crucial to the description of real systems .",
    "what is important is the appearance of a `` condensation , '' by which we mean the rapid accumulation of a substantial fraction of the @xmath0 particles into the ground state ( without big fluctuations about this average ) when the temperature falls below a certain finite value . we will show that even a finite one - dimensional ideal bose gas in a harmonic potential has this property .",
    "the choice of the canonical ensemble and the use of the recurrence relations are particularly suitable for the study of finite systems . thus a simple model with physical properties",
    "amenable to calculation is available to be exploited for pedagogical or other purposes .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : grand ] we will review the standard grand canonical ensemble treatment of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) harmonic ideal bose gas and identify a temperature below which there is a substantial accumulation of particles in the ground state .",
    "we will also identify the physically unrealistic fluctuations in the ground - state occupation that appear in the grand canonical ensemble description . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bosegas ] we will show how the 1d bose gas can be treated by developing a recurrence relation for the partition function .",
    "more general recurrence relations for the average number of particles in a single - particle state and for the partition function are developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : recur ] .",
    "armed with these tools , we compare canonical ensemble calculations with their grand canonical ensemble equivalents . for a finite system",
    "there are only small differences in the mean values ; however , there are large differences in the root - mean - square fluctuations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cycles ] we look at the condensation problem from a quite different point of view , namely that of permutation cycles  la feynman.@xcite such a view gives a physical explanation to several mathematical formulations found in the previous sections and especially to the partition function recurrence relation .",
    "from this point of view we also see that the grand canonical ensemble misrepresents the condensate , while the canonical ensemble treats it accurately .",
    "we find the somewhat surprising result that the condensate is made up of equally probable permutation cycles of all lengths up to the condensate number .",
    "we first consider a grand canonical ensemble treatment of bec in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) harmonic well . although our approach is typical of most statistical physics textbooks , we know of only one such book that actually covers this particular example.@xcite the harmonic potential leads to equally spaced single - particle energy levels given by @xmath4 with @xmath5 a nonnegative integer .",
    "the zero - point energy , omitted in eq .",
    "( [ ener ] ) , can be restored to any physical quantity at the end of the calculation .",
    "the constant @xmath6 is related to the harmonic angular frequency @xmath7 by @xmath8 .    in the grand canonical ensemble@xcite",
    "the average number of particles @xmath0 is given by the relation @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the chemical potential . in bose problems the denominator is often expanded in powers of @xmath12 to yield @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the one - body partition function at the effective inverse temperature @xmath15 . in sec .",
    "v we will see that the sum over @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ n2 ] ) represents a sum over permutation cycles .    for the very weak potentials used to trap @xmath0 particles experimentally , the harmonic oscillator states are very closely spaced ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "thus to a good approximation we can replace the sum over @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ n2 ] ) by an integral .",
    "( alternatively , we could directly replace the sum in eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) by an integral to arrive at the same result . ) because @xmath18 , we find @xmath19 the sum in eq .",
    "( [ n3 ] ) is one of the bose integrals,@xcite which in this case can be evaluated analytically .",
    "of course , changing the sum to an integral is valid only if the summand is a smooth function of @xmath5 ; we then lose the contribution of the lowest state when it becomes occupied with order @xmath0 particles .",
    "hence @xmath20 in eq .  ( [ n3 ] )",
    "is just the contribution of the excited states , and we obtain the total number @xmath0 by including the ground - state population : @xmath21 where @xmath22 we want to identify a bose - einstein `` transition temperature , '' that is , one below which there will be a sizable fraction of the @xmath0 particles in the ground state . from eq .",
    "( [ nzero ] ) this requirement implies that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a number of order unity . if we invert eq .",
    "( [ n3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath25 so that @xmath26 . because @xmath20 is of order @xmath0 at the transition",
    ", we find that the condensate will be large for temperatures below @xmath27 defined by@xcite @xmath28 we can show@xcite that the density of the system is proportional to @xmath29 , so that , in the thermodynamic limit , we keep the numerator @xmath30 constant while letting @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "then the characteristic temperature will go to zero as 1/@xmath33 , which is small only for extremely large @xmath0 . in actual 1d experiments,@xcite where @xmath0 is about @xmath34",
    ", the logarithm reduces this characteristic temperature only by a factor of order ten compared to @xmath35 , an experimentally accessible value .",
    "nevertheless , we say that there is a `` quasi - condensation '' rather than a real one .",
    "for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) ideal gas we find that an actual phase transition occurs ; however , in accord with the hohenberg theorem,@xcite this transition disappears if there are particle - particle interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "some authors have claimed that the 1d and 2d finite interacting systems at sufficiently low temperature have a _ true _ condensation , because the coherence length becomes larger than the finite condensate size.@xcite ( moreover , in 2d we expect a true phase transition of the kosterlitz - thouless variety@xcite at a temperature of order @xmath36 . )",
    "it is straightforward to solve eq .",
    "( [ n2 ] ) numerically for the chemical potential @xmath11 and compute the exact condensate number eq .",
    "( [ nzero ] ) for some given average @xmath0 value . in fig .  1 we show the occupation of the first two energy levels for @xmath0 = 500 .",
    "we see that @xmath27 provides a fairly good estimate of the quasi - condensation temperature .",
    "many textbooks compute particle - number fluctuations in the grand canonical ensemble.@xcite the grand partition function for any ideal bose gas with states @xmath37 each occupied by @xmath38 particles is@xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the canonical partition function of an @xmath0-particle system .",
    "the average square deviation of the occupation number @xmath38 is @xmath41 with no condensate we have @xmath42 for all except a negligible number of excited states , so @xmath43 , and we have a normal distribution with @xmath44 however , with a condensate of order @xmath0 , we have @xmath45 that is , the fluctuations of the condensate are as large as the condensate itself  a manifestly unphysical result .",
    "this problem is not new,@xcite but has received a large amount of recent attention,@xcite including the invention of a new `` fourth '' ensemble  the so - called `` maxwell demon '' ensemble  to take care of it.@xcite    there are various explanations of what goes wrong with the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "grossmann and holthaus@xcite state that `` [ t]he relative mean square fluctuations of the ground state population , and thus the relative fluctuations of the total particle number , approach unity : as a result of particle exchange with the reservoir , the uncertainty of the number of particles becomes comparable with @xmath46 itself .",
    "this fluctuation catastrophe is related to the divergency of the quantum coherence length @xmath47 for @xmath48 . when @xmath47 vastly exceeds the length scale characterizing the system under consideration , a rigid distinction between ` system ' and ` reservoir ' is no longer practical . ''",
    "the difficulty also can be stated in more mathematical terms .",
    "the grand canonical ensemble often is shown to be equivalent to the canonical ensemble by using the method of steepest descents,@xcite which evaluates the canonical partition function by an approximation to a complex integral of the grand canonical partition function .",
    "wilkens and weiss@xcite state that `` the most common procedure is to evaluate the contour integral in a stationary phase approximation . in leading order one recovers the grand - canonical formulation .",
    "however , below @xmath49 , fluctuations are badly represented in this approach .",
    "the reason is that , for large @xmath0 , the saddle point is located within a distance @xmath50 from the branch point while the gaussian approximation for the fluctuations assumes a much larger range of validity @xmath51 . ''",
    "we will not pursue the cause of this difficulty further , but will avoid it by using the canonical ensemble .",
    "we next examine the 1d ideal bose gas by using the canonical ensemble . there is a simple recurrence relation for the partition function of this model . as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : recur ] , there are more general recurrence relations by which other problems ( for example , the 3d ideal bose gas ) can be treated .",
    "the connection between the two formulations turns out to be a special case of a famous theorem in number theory as we demonstrate in sec .",
    "[ sec : recur ] .",
    "if we let @xmath52 , the grand partition function of eq .  ( [ zgce ] ) can be written as @xmath53 where the prime in the sum over @xmath54 implies a sum over all @xmath55 such that @xmath56 . if we define @xmath57 , the last exponential in eq .",

    "for example , @xmath65 can be partitioned in 5 ways : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , which is equivalent to the number of ways that four bose particles can be put in equally spaced states 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 to have 4 units of energy .",
    "euler , gauss , hardy , ramanujan , and many other famous mathematicians have contributed theorems on partitions.@xcite    we do not need an explicit expression for @xmath62 .",

    "equation  ( [ z1dbose ] ) is applicable to the 1d harmonic bose gas .",
    "however , in a recent article , schnhammer@xcite showed that an almost identical relation holds for the 1d ideal harmonic _ fermi _ gas .",

    "the fermi partition function differs only in having a factor @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the fermi zero - point energy .",
