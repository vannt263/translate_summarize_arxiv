    "cuprate materials are unusual in that the undoped cuprates are insulators with an antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range - order ( aflro ) , and changing the carrier concentration by ionic substitution or increase of the oxygen content turns these compounds into correlated metals leaving short - range af correlations still intact @xcite .",
    "the single common feature of cuprate superconductors is the presence of the two - dimensional cuo@xmath5 plane @xcite , and it seems evident that the unusual behaviors of doped cuprates are dominated by the cuo@xmath5 plane @xcite .",
    "this layered crystal structure leads to that cuprate superconductors are highly anisotropic materials , then the electron spectral function @xmath6 is dependent on the in - plane momentum @xcite .",
    "after twenty years extensive studies , it has been shown that many of the unusual physical properties have often been attributed to particular characteristics of low energy excitations determined by the electronic structure @xcite .",
    "although the electronic structure of doped cuprates is well - established by now @xcite , its full understanding is still a challenging issue .",
    "experimentally , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments have provided rather detailed information on the electronic structure of the doped single layer and bilayer cuprates @xcite .",
    "an important issue is whether the behavior of the low energy excitations determined by the electronic structure is universal or not .",
    "the early arpes measurements @xcite showed that the charge carriers doped into the parent compounds first enter into the @xmath7 $ ] ( in units of inverse lattice constant ) point in the brillouin zone .",
    "moreover , the electron spectral function @xmath6 has a flat band form as a function of energy @xmath8 for momentum @xmath9 in the vicinity of the @xmath3 $ ] point , which leads to the unusual quasiparticle dispersion around the @xmath3 $ ] point with anomalously small changes of electron energy as a function of momentum @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this flat band is just below the fermi energy .",
    "recently , the improvements in the resolution of the arpes experiments @xcite allowed to resolve additional features in the electron spectral function @xmath6 . among these new achievements",
    "is the observation of the bilayer splitting ( bs ) in doped bilayer cuprates in a wide doping range @xcite . in this case , whether the electronic structure of doped cuprates can be influenced by the interaction between cuo@xmath5 planes has been an interesting issue .",
    "the study of the electronic structure is complicated by the bs , that is , the bs of the cuo@xmath5 plane derived the electronic structure in the bonding and antibonding bands due to the present of cuo@xmath5 bilayer blocks in the unit cell of doped bilayer cuprates @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the bs is the doping independent , and increases upon approaching the @xmath3 $ ] point , where the bs exhibits the largest value . as a result of the maximal bs at the @xmath3 $ ] point , there are two main flat bands around the @xmath3 $ ] point @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that a well pronounced peak - dip - hump structure in the electron spectrum of doped bilayer cuprates in the superconducting state is partially caused by the bs @xcite . theoretically ,",
    "the electron - removal spectral functions at the @xmath3 $ ] point and quasiparticle dispersion of the multilayer cuprates in the normal state has been discussed @xcite within the two - dimensional multilayer @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath10-@xmath2 model based on the resonating valence bond wave function and gutzwiller approximation , in particular , their results show that there are two main flat bands around the @xmath3 $ ] point in the bilayer system .",
    "however , the resonating valence bond wave function and gutzwiller approximation can be only applied to discuss the zero temperature physical properties of doped cuprates . to the best of our knowledge , the doping and temperature dependence of the electron spectrum and quasiparticle dispersion in both doped single layer and bilayer cuprates",
    "have not been treated from a unified point of view for the normal state .    in our earlier work using the charge - spin separation ( css ) fermion - spin theory @xcite , the electronic structure of the doped single layer cuprates has been calculated within the single layer @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model @xcite , and the obtained doping dependence of the electron spectrum and quasiparticle dispersion are consistent with the corresponding arpes experiments @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show explicitly if the bilayer interaction is included , one can reproduce some main features in the normal state observed experimentally on doped bilayer cuprates @xcite .",
    "the differentiation between the bonding and antibonding components is essential .",
    "two main flat bands around the @xmath3 $ ] point are rather similar to the scenario argued in refs . ,",
    "@xcite , and @xcite for the normal state , and the quasiparticle dispersion we derive from the bilayer @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model ( without additional terms and adjustable parameters ) demonstrates explicitly this energy band splitting . in comparison with the case of the doped single layer",
    "cuprates @xcite , our present results also show that the striking behavior of the electronic structure in doped bilayer cuprates is intriguingly related to the bilayer interaction together with strong coupling between the electron quasiparticles and collective magnetic excitations .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the bilayer @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model that include the bilayer hopping and bilayer magnetic exchange interaction . within this bilayer @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model , we calculate explicitly the longitudinal and transverse components of the electron green s functions based on the css fermion - spin theory by considering charge carrier fluctuations , and then obtain the bonding and antibonding electron spectral functions according to these longitudinal and transverse components of the electron green s functions . the doping and temperature dependence of the electron spectrum and quasiparticle dispersion of doped bilayer cuprates in the normal state",
    "are presented in sec .",
    "iv is devoted to a summary and discussions .",
    "the basic element of cuprate materials is two - dimensional cuo@xmath5 plane , and it is believed that the unusual behaviors of doped cuprates are closely related to the doped cuo@xmath5 plane as mentioned above @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the essential physics of the doped cuo@xmath5 plane is contained in the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model on a square lattice @xcite . in this case , the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model in the bilayer structure is expressed as , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is plane index , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator , @xmath17 is the spin operator with @xmath18 as pauli matrices , @xmath19 is the chemical potential , and the interlayer hopping @xcite , @xmath20 describes coherent hopping between the cuo@xmath5 planes .",
    "this functional form of the interlayer hopping in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is predicted on the basis of the local density approximation calculations @xcite , and later the experimental observed bs agrees well with it @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 hamiltonian ( 1 ) is supplemented by the single occupancy local constraint @xmath21 .",
    "this local constraint can be treated properly in analytical calculations within the css fermion - spin theory @xcite , where the constrained electron operators in the @xmath0-@xmath2 type model are decoupled as @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with the spinful fermion operator @xmath24 keeps track of the charge degree of freedom together with some effects of the spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped hole itself ( dressed holon ) , while the spin operator @xmath25 keeps track of the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the advantage of this css fermion - spin theory is that the electron local constraint for single occupancy , @xmath26 , is satisfied in analytical calculations , and the double spinful fermion occupancies @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are ruled out automatically .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that these dressed holons and spins are gauge invariant , and in this sense they are real and can be interpreted as the physical excitations @xcite .",
    "although in common sense @xmath29 is not a real spinful fermion , it behaves like a spinful fermion . in this css fermion - spin representation ,",
    "the low - energy behavior of the bilayer @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be expressed as , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the hole doping concentration . as a result ,",
    "the magnetic energy term in the bilayer @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model is only to form an adequate spin configuration @xcite , while the kinetic energy part has been expressed as the interaction between the dressed holons and spins , and then this interaction dominates the essential physics of doped cuprates @xcite .    within the css fermion - spin theory , the electron spectral function and related quasiparticle dispersion of the doped single layer cuprates in the normal state",
    "have been discussed by considering the dressed holon fluctuations around the mean - field ( mf ) solution @xcite , where the spin part is limited to the first - order ( the mf level ) , while the full dressed holon green s function is treated self - consistently in terms of the eliashberg s strong coupling theory @xcite . for doped bilayer cuprates ,",
    "there are two coupled cuo@xmath5 planes in the unit cell .",
    "this leads to that the energy spectrum has two branches , then the dressed holon and spin green s functions are matrices , and can be expressed as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , where the longitudinal and transverse parts are corresponding to the in - layer and inter - layer green s functions @xcite . in this case , we follow the previous discussions for the single layer case @xcite , and obtain explicitly the longitudinal and transverse parts of the full dressed holon green s functions of the doped bilayer system as [ see the appendix ] ,    @xmath36    with the renormalized dressed holon excitation spectrum @xmath37 , where the mf dressed holon excitation spectrum is given as , @xmath38 with the spin correlation functions @xmath39 ,",
