    "the fraunhofer g band around 4305 includes significant contributions from vibro - rotational transitions of the @xmath0 electronic system of the ch molecule .",
    "this band has been important in high spatial resolution studies of solar surface magnetism because photospheric bright points are seen with very high contrast when observed in the g band ( see snchez almeida et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ; see also the recent g band images of scharmer et al .",
    "2002 and of snchez almeida et al .",
    "2004 which show bright points around sunspots and in the internetwork quiet sun , respectively ) .",
    "for this reason , theoretical and observational investigations of the zeeman effect in the g band are of great scientific interest .    in a recent paper ( see uitenbroek et al .",
    "2004 ) we have investigated theoretically the zeeman effect in the g band , including radiative transfer simulations of the emergent stokes profiles in ` quiet ' sun models . in spite of the fact that this spectral region contains a multitude of overlapping atomic and molecular lines we could find several isolated groups of ch lines that were predicted to produce measurable circular polarization signals in the presence of magnetic fields . in particular , in one wavelength location near 4304   the overlap of several magnetically sensitive and non - sensitive ch lines was predicted to produce a single - lobed stokes @xmath1 profile that could be of great interest for future high spatial - resolution narrow - band polarimetric imaging of the solar surface .",
    "the main aim of this letter is to report on the first observational study of the zeeman effect in the g band , but including also radiative transfer calculations in a semi - empirical model of sunspot atmospheres .",
    "our spectropolarimetric observations of sunspots fully confirm the above - mentioned theoretical prediction . as we shall see below",
    ", a preliminary comparison of the observed and calculated stokes profiles demonstrates that the zeeman effect in the g band offers a new diagnostic window for empirical investigations on solar and stellar magnetism .",
    "prior to reporting on our spectropolarimetric observations it is useful to show first the emergent stokes profiles that we expect for the atmospheres of sunspot umbrae . to this end , we have used the cool semi - empirical model of collados et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , but assuming a vertical magnetic field of constant strength .",
    "this is sufficient for our demonstrative purposes that is , for showing that the _ shapes _ of the computed @xmath2 profiles agree with those we have observed in sunspots and for highlighting the diagnostic interest of the zeeman effect in the g band .",
    "the vector radiative transfer equation for the emergent stokes profiles has been solved by applying the quasi - parabolic delo method ( trujillo bueno 2003 ) , in a way similar to that described by uitenbroek et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "figure [ fig_syn ] shows the calculated @xmath2 profiles in two spectral regions of the g band assuming a vertical magnetic field of 2000 g. the left and right panels correspond to the 4304   and 4312   spectral regions , respectively .",
    "the chosen line of sight is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the heliocentric angle .",
    "it is important to advance here that the observed stokes profiles described in section 3 are affected by a stray - light contamination of @xmath54% , which we have determined by comparing the intensity profiles of kitt peak s atlas observed with the fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) with our own observations at the solar disk center .",
    "for this reason , in fig .",
    "[ fig_syn ] we have also shown the artificial reduction in the _ amplitude _ of the computed @xmath2 profiles that results when a 4% contribution of the intensity profiles obtained in the quiet sun model fal - c ( fontenla et al 1993 ) is added to the calculated stokes @xmath6 profiles in the umbra model . the solid line shows the emergent stokes profiles calculated by including both the atomic and ch lines , while the dashed line represents the emergent stokes profiles obtained by including only the ch lines .",
    "the dashed - dotted line represents the emergent stokes profiles calculated without including any stray - light contamination .",
    "the wavelengths and oscillator strengths for the ch lines have been obtained from jrgensen s et al ( 1996 ) linelist while those for the atomic lines have been obtained from cd - rom 1 by kurucz . in both spectral regions we have @xmath2 features dominated by ch lines only .",
    "for example , the one - lobe @xmath2 profile at 4304   results from the blend between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 lines of the @xmath9 band , which gives a @xmath10-doublet with effective land factor @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath2 profile at 4313.7   is produced by the blend of the ch lines @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "finally , the @xmath2 feature at 4312 is produced by many overlapping ch lines , but mainly by the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 from the @xmath9 band and by the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 from the @xmath22 band . note that the ch lines that produce clean @xmath2 signals result from transitions between levels with small @xmath23-values ( i.e. , with @xmath24 ) .",
    "the spectropolarimetric observations were carried out on 2003 august 30 using the uv version of the zrich imaging polarimeter ( zimpol ; see povel 2001 ) attached to the gregory coud telescope of the istituto ricerche solari locarno ( irsol ) . in order to facilitate an irrefutable observational proof of the predicted stokes @xmath2 profiles we selected a bipolar sunspot group ( noaa 0447 ) , which was located at @xmath25 .",
    "we observed simultaneously the two sunspots of opposite magnetic polarity . to this end , a dove prism located after the analyzer ( modulator + linear polarizer ) allowed us to rotate the solar image in order to get the image of the umbrae of the two main spots on the spectrograph slit .",
    "the direction of the slit formed an angle of @xmath26 with respect to the closest limb .",
    "the slit width was 80 @xmath27 m , which corresponds to 0.7   on the solar surface .",
    "the spatial and spectral extensions covered by the zimpol ccd were 160  and 3.1  , respectively .",
    "the zimpol version used for these observations has one piezoelastic modulator ( pem ) , which allows to measure simultaneously the intensity @xmath6 , and the fractional stokes parameters @xmath28 and @xmath2 for linear and circular polarization , respectively . due to the high modulation rate ( 42 khz which is much higher than the typical seeing frequencies of the order of hundreds of hertzs )",
    "the seeing - induced crosstalk is insignificant and the noise level in the polarization signals is established only by photon statistics .",
    "zimpol is a one beam system and the same pixel of the ccd is used to measure all stokes components .",
    "therefore , no flatfield technique is needed to correct the polarization images .",
    "a calibration is performed by inserting known amounts of polarization in front of the analyzer ( pem + linear polarizer ) .",
    "the dark current table correction is also applied .",
    "our measurements were performed by adding 60 registrations , each of them taken with an integration time of 5 seconds .",
    "the reduced data are affected by instrumental polarization caused by the two folding mirrors inside the gregory coud telescope ( for details see gandorfer et al .",
    "the ensuing effects ( i.e. , a shift of the zero polarization level smaller than 1% and a 2% crosstalk from @xmath2 to @xmath28 ) were quite small and constant over the day and could be easily corrected . in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the @xmath2 profiles shown in the following two figures",
    ", we averaged over 4 pixels along the spatial direction , which corresponds to 4.5  inside the sunspot umbrae .",
    "no other data reduction procedures like smoothing or filtering were applied .",
    "figure [ fig_obs_v4303 ] shows examples of the observed stokes @xmath2 profiles around 4304  , which is the wavelength position of the ch lines that were predicted to produce a peculiar stokes @xmath2 profile dominated by its red lobe ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_syn ] ) .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig_obs_v4303 ] corresponds to the sunspot with the positive polarity ( i.e. , with the magnetic field vector pointing outwards ) , while the bottom panel refers to the sunspot with the negative polarity .",
    "each of the vertical marks in the lower part of the plot indicate the position of a ch line while those in the upper part indicate the position of an atomic line .",
    "note that each of the observed signals is produced by a blend of many lines .",
    "in full agreement with our theoretical @xmath2 profiles of sunspot umbrae ( see fig . [ fig_syn ] ) the observed circular polarization at 4304   is dominated by a single - lobed stokes @xmath2 profile whose sign changes when going to the sunspot with the other magnetic polarity .",
    "the same occurs with the stokes @xmath2 profile at 4304.6  , which is produced by atomic lines alone .",
    "figure [ fig_obs_v4313 ] shows the observed @xmath2 profiles for an extra spectral region that also shows stokes profiles dominated by ch lines alone .",
    "note the polarity reversal between the two observed sunspots and the good agreement with the shapes of the theoretical @xmath2 profiles at 4312   and 4313.7   shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_syn ] .",
    "the stokes @xmath2 profiles around 4313   are mainly due to atomic lines .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that the observed linear polarization turns out to be very small at the above - mentioned wavelength locations which show @xmath2 features dominated by ch lines .",
    "however , we have detected sizable @xmath28 signals ( of the order of @xmath29 ) that are produced by atomic lines alone .",
    "we find significant linear polarization _ in both umbrae and penumbrae _ , with the signals in the penumbral regions being slightly larger than in the umbral ones .",
    "figure [ fig_obs_q4303 ] shows an example of the observed fractional linear polarization in the penumbra of one of the observed sunspots .",
    "we think that the @xmath28 feature at 4304   is produced by the same ch lines that are responsible of the observed @xmath2 profile shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_obs_v4303 ] .    a comparison with fig",
    ". [ fig_syn ] shows that the agreement between the _ shapes _ of the calculated and the observed @xmath2 profiles is remarkable .",
    "however , the _ amplitudes _ of the @xmath2 profiles calculated in one - dimensional models of sunspot atmospheres are significantly larger than the observed ones when the theoretical modeling is carried out assuming a magnetic filling factor @xmath30 and a typical magnetic field strength of 2000 g , even after taking into account the reduction in the @xmath2 amplitude obtained when accounting for the stray - light contamination mentioned in section 2 .",
    "we consider this as an indication of the presence of horizontal inhomogeneities in the photospheric regions of sunspot umbrae coexisting within the spatio - temporal resolution element of the observation .",
    "these inhomogeneities might be associated with the multitude of umbral dots that are seen in high resolution images of sunspots .",
    "interestingly , our finding of linear polarization signals in the observed sunspot umbrae , which were located very close to the disk center during our observing period , could be indicating that the suggested umbral dot component has inclined magnetic fields , in agreement with the existing magnetohydrodynamical models for the subsurface structure of sunspots ( see , e.g. , the recent review by socas - navarro 2003 ) .",
    "the polarization profiles we have observed in sunspots confirm our previous theoretical modeling of the longitudinal zeeman effect in the g band .",
    "there are at least three wavelength locations which show measurable @xmath2 profiles that are produced by ch lines alone . in the sunspot group",
    "we have observed ( located at @xmath25 ) the observed linear polarization at the wavelength location of such ch lines was very small , but not negligible ( see , e.g. , the @xmath28 feature at 4304   in fig . [ fig_obs_q4303 ] ) .",
    "however , we have found sizable circular and linear polarization signals in many of the atomic lines that are contained in the spectral region of the g band .",
    "such polarization signals in molecular and atomic lines contain valuable information about the physical conditions in the solar atmosphere .",
    "for instance , a preliminary comparison between observed and calculated stokes profiles suggests that the magnetic and/or thermodynamical properties in the photospheric regions of sunspot umbrae are horizontally structured with a component that might be associated with umbral dots .",
    "we think that the theoretical interpretation of observations of the zeeman effect in the g band offers a new diagnostic window for exploring the thermal and magnetic structuring of the solar photosphere .",
    "this type of investigations could help us to choose among competing mhd models on the subsurface structure of sunspot umbrae and/or to improve our physical understanding of the magnetic field strength in the bright points of the ` quiet ' solar surface . in a future paper",
    "we plan to address the issue of the inversion of spectropolarimetric observations in the g band , since this promises also to be important for improving our knowledge on solar and stellar magnetism .",
