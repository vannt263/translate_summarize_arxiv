    "although the spin - lattice interactions in magnetic insulators can often be ignored , in some cases the coupling between the spin degrees of freedom and the lattice vibrations ( phonons ) plays a crucial role .",
    "for example , in ultrasound experiments one uses the spin - lattice coupling to study the properties of the spin degrees of freedom from the measurement of the propagation and the attenuation of sound waves  @xcite .",
    "the theory of magneto - elastic effects in magnetic insulators has been developed more than half a century ago by abrahams and kittel @xcite , and by kaganov and tsukernik @xcite .",
    "while in the past decades a few theoretical studies of magneto - elastic effects have appeared @xcite , recent experimental progress in the field of spintronics has revived the interest in the interactions between spin and lattice degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the present work is motivated by an experiment @xcite where the coupling between magnons and phonons in the magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) was probed via a spatially resolved measurement of the magnon temperature @xmath0 in the presence of a thermal gradient . in the short wavelength exchange part of the magnon spectrum @xmath0",
    "was found to agree almost perfectly with the temperature @xmath1 of the phonon bath . in order to reconcile this finding with earlier studies of the spin seebeck effect @xcite ( which relies on the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , the authors of ref .",
    "[ ] speculated that in the long - wavelength dipolar part of the spectrum the magnon temperature significantly differs from @xmath1 , suggesting a rather weak coupling between magnons and phonons in this regime . in this work",
    "we offer a microscopic explanation for such a momentum dependence of the magnon temperature : we show that the lifetime @xmath2 of magnons due to coupling to the phonons in yig is strongly momentum dependent ; in particular @xmath2 exhibits a pronounced minimum in the exchange regime and is two orders of magnitude larger in the dipolar regime . since in the dipolar part of the spectrum the magnons have a longer lifetime , in this regime phonons are less effective to thermalize the magnons and the differences between @xmath0 and @xmath1 can persist for longer times .",
    "we also present experimental results for the magnon damping in the dipolar regime , which have been obtained by means of time- and wave - vector - resolved brillouin light scattering ( bls ) spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the experimentally determined damping rate is three orders of magnitude larger than our theoretical prediction , although the qualitative behavior as a function of in - plane momentum is similar .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that in our calculations only the relaxation due to magnon - phonon interactions has been taken into account .",
    "apparently , in the long - wavelength dipolar regime other scattering channels leading to momentum relaxation are dominant , such as elastic magnon - impurity scattering .",
