    "`` polyelectrolytes are polymers bearing ionizable groups , which , in polar solvents , can dissociate into charged polymer chains ( macroions ) and small counterions '' @xcite . the combination of macromolecular properties and long - range electrostatic interactions results in an impressive variety of phenomena .",
    "it makes these systems interesting from a fundamental as well as a technological point of view .",
    "a thorough understanding of polyelectrolytes has become increasingly important in biochemistry and molecular biology .",
    "this is due to the fact that virtually all proteins , as well as the dna , are polyelectrolytes .",
    "their interactions with each other and with the charged cell - membrane are still far from being fully understood , which is partly due to the intricate coupling between ion distribution and chain conformation .",
    "a first approach to the problem is to fix the conformation of the chain and to focus on a detailed description of the counterion distribution .",
    "usually polyelectrolytes stretch due to the electrostatic repulsion of their charged groups .",
    "moreover , many important polyelectrolytes have a large intrinsic stiffness ( e.g. , dna , actin filaments or microtubules ) .",
    "therefore , a rod - like conformation is an obvious first choice .",
    "the remaining problem of charged rods immersed into solution is much easier , but is still far from being exactly solvable .",
    "an additional approximation , which is frequently used in theoretical descriptions , is to completely integrate out the counterionic degrees of freedom . on a linearized mean - field level",
    "this yields a debye - hckel - like theory characterized by a screened coulomb potential between charged monomers . to obtain the correct physical properties",
    ", one uses an _ effective _ yukawa potential , which in turn requires adjustable parameters such as an effective polyelectrolyte radius and charge . in this way",
    "the dependence of the ionic structure , hereafter called electrical double layer ( edl ) , around two or more polyelectrolytes , as a function of the polyelectrolyte - polyelectrolyte distance , is not accounted for .",
    "this information , however , is most relevant for the understanding of polyelectrolyte aggregation or self - assembling .",
    "this effect is more important for polyelectrolytes in low concentration added salt solution , since for this case the ionic screening is weak .",
    "this has been shown to be relevant for charged plates and charged spherical macroions @xcite .",
    "a common further approximation assumes that the investigation of a small sub - volume containing only one rod and its counterions will suffice to unveil much of the interesting physics .",
    "the main justification for this approach is that the sub - volume has zero net charge .",
    "moreover , the counterions will also efficiently screen higher order multipoles .",
    "hence , the interactions between two such sub - volumes , which are neglected when focusing on just one rod , will be fairly weak .",
    "this approximation is called cylindrical cell model and it provides the framework for our simulation calculation .",
    "one attractive feature of the cell model is that in the salt - free case the nonlinear pb equation can be solved _",
    "exactly _ in this geometry @xcite .",
    "it also displays in a clear fashion the effect of partial counterion _ condensation _ @xcite .",
    "while a charged sphere loses all its counterions upon dilution , a charged plane keeps all of them . for a charged cylinder",
    "the fraction of ions , which upon dilution remain in the vicinity of the macroion , can be anywhere between @xmath2 and @xmath3% .",
    "addition of salt increases the screening of the charged rod .",
    "if the salt content is large enough , the electric field will have decayed to zero before the cell radius is reached .",
    "it is then permissible to extend the latter to infinity .",
    "this is the approach that we use for our integral equation calculations .",
    "the pb theory shows its limitations for systems where ion correlations become important @xcite .",
    "it can not predict the attractive forces which are seen experimentally in dna solutions @xcite and which have been also found in various simulation @xcite and integral equation @xcite studies in the presence of multivalent counterions .    in this paper",
    "we present studies for a rod immersed in a salt solution which pb theory fails to describe correctly , namely , the possibility of overcharging a single rod , resulting in an effective charge reversal , and the appearance of a non - monotonic zeta - potential @xcite .",
    "this effect is most relevant in electrophoresis experiments @xcite .",
    "the overcharging of a macroion modifies in a non - linear fashion the electrophoretic mobility as a function of the polyelectrolyte charge and salt concentration . in the classical electrophoresis theory of wiersema , obrien and white @xcite , which is a linear theory based on the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) description of the edl around the polyelectrolyte ,",
    "this effect is not included .",
    "the edl obtained through the well established integral equation approach does predict overcharging @xcite .",
    "the overcharging effect has been observed in monte carlo ( mc ) simulations for planar @xcite , cylindrical @xcite and spherical @xcite geometries . moreover ,",
    "several years ago , gonzales - tovar _",
    "et al._@xcite predicted that for some macroion charge and electrolyte concentration the overcharging produces an electrophoresis mobility reversal .",
    "this mobility reversal has been experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "this effect has been taken into account in the electrophoresis theory by lozada - cassou _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "an excellent qualitative agreement with experimental results @xcite is found .",
    "this overcharging effect and the predicted mobility reversal have been recently addressed by deserno _",

    "several methods have been proposed in the literature to handle this problem .",
    "they essentially all use as a unit cell a hexagonal prism with a certain height .",
    "this approximates the cylindrical cell by the `` most round '' space - filling object . in this publication",
    "we take a computationally even simpler approach by using a _",
    "cubic _ unit box of side - length @xmath7 and placing the dna parallel to one of the edges ( see fig .  [",
    "pic : cellpicture ] ) .",
    "the justification for this approach is as follows : in a high - salt environment the charged rod will be screened within a distance much smaller than the size of the box",
    ". the potential will therefore become constant long before the deviations from a cylindrical cell will be felt .",
    "it is thus largely irrelevant , whether these deviations are of hexagonal or of cubic type .",
    "when comparing with the cylindrical cell model , a radius @xmath8 is appropriate , since it yields the same area per rod .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that such a system can be treated with the plain cubic ewald sum or one of its mesh - upgrades @xcite .",
    "this permits a very efficient way for computing the long - range electrostatic interactions .",
    "a specification of two interaction potentials is necessary to describe the model system : _ (",
    "i ) _ an excluded volume interaction preventing two particles from occupying the same position in space and _ ( ii ) _ the long - range coulomb potential .    for the excluded volume interaction between the ions we use the following potential : @xmath9 & 0 < r \\le        r_{{\\operatorname{cut}}}\\equiv 2^{1/6}a \\\\[2ex ] 0 & r_{{\\operatorname{cut } } } < r.    \\end{array }    \\right .",

    "the number of charges along the rod per bjerrum length is an important dimensionless measure of the line charge density and is often referred to as the manning parameter : @xmath32 its relevance lies in the fact that for @xmath33 the phenomenon of counterion `` condensation '' is observed @xcite .    within the periodic boundary conditions employed during the simulations ,",

    "further , strikingly , the system with small divalent ions shows no sign of overcharging , although the charge parameter for this system is even higher .",
    "the shoulder in the distribution of the md simulation indicates that the second ionic layer is almost neutral .",

    "is that the interaction energy between ions exceeds the interaction between ions and the rod . also consistent is , that the hnc / msa calculation as well shows the vanishing of the overcharging .",
    "finally , one might ask the question of how the effect of overcharging depends on salt concentration . obviously there can not be any overcharging in the absence of salt , since then even a complete `` condensation '' of all ions",
    "would merely neutralize the rod .",

    "the phenomenon of overcharging is indeed observed , but only at sufficiently high salt concentration .",
    "these results are consistent with the fact that higher electrolyte concentration increases the excluded volume , thus increases overcharging  @xcite .",
    "therefore , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , higher excluded volume implies higher overcharging .",

    "clearly , @xmath106 must increase with decreasing @xmath105 , since overcharging is reduced and consequently the size of the charge - compensating layer must increase .",
    "in fact , hypernetted - chain theory predicts that @xmath110 diverges at some _ finite _ density @xmath111 corresponding to a salt debye length of @xmath112 , or roughly 200 salt molecules within the simulation box . for the lower concentrations , the simulated @xmath106 values lie below the hypernetted - chain prediction , but this is not a feature generally to be expected . in fig .  [",
    "fig : dna_pr_mep_rho ] it can be seen that the stronger overcharging in hypernetted - chain theory should normally lead to a value of @xmath106 smaller than in the simulation .",
    "but with decreasing density the finite radius of the simulation cell becomes relevant .",
    "indeed , zero - salt distribution functions reach the value @xmath48 at the cell boundary , and not at infinity .",
    "a reduction of the amount of added salt at fixed cell radius must necessarily lead to values of @xmath106 smaller than the hypernetted chain prediction for the bulk , since within a finite cell @xmath106 can not diverge .",
    "on the other hand , for technical reasons , the md cell radius can not be increased indefinitely . in any case , our md results have not been able to unambiguously detect overcharging at densities equal to or lower than @xmath113 , which is in excellent agreement with the hnc / msa prediction for the minimum amount of salt needed to induce overcharging . from figs .",
    "( [ fig : dna_pr_mep_rho ] ) and ( [ fig : dna_r1_rho ] ) it is clear that excluded volume effects determine the occurrence of overcharging , as proposed by some of us @xcite .",
    "theoretical and numerical studies of stiff linear polyelectrolytes , immersed into a 2:2 rpm electrolyte have been presented .",
    "the qualitative agreement between the md and hnc / msa results is excellent . for the particular case of dna parameters ,",
    "there is also a very good quantitative agreement .",
    "we argued that the better agreement in the planar and spherical case reported in refs .",
    "@xcite is most probably due to an implementation of the short range interactions that is identical to the theoretical model and not merely very close . at low salt concentrations",
    "the difference between a finite cell used in simulations and the @xmath114 system used in the hnc / msa calculations becomes important .",
    "also , the macroion and ions electrical fields are much less screened and , hence , the charge correlations become more important @xcite .",
    "both these points are responsible for the disagreement between theory and simulations at low salt .",
    "while the former can in principle be resolved by increasing the size of the simulation cell , the latter can be addressed by the three point extension hnc / msa theory @xcite , which gives a better account of these correlations @xcite . in the past",
    "the hnc / msa theory for an electrolyte next to a charged rod has been derived @xcite and applied @xcite to simple dna models . in this paper",
    "we have shown this theory to be qualitatively correct .",
    "in particular , for dna parameters the quantitative agreement is excellent . to the best of our knowledge , in gonzales - tovar _",
    "et al._@xcite overcharging has first been predicted theoretically .",
    "it was point out that this should entail an electrophoresis mobility reversal . in the pb theory the @xmath1-potential as",
    "a function of the cylinder charge density is a monotonic function , while in the hnc / msa theory it is not . in this paper",
    "we have shown the hnc / msa prediction to be in agreement with md calculations .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior of the @xmath1-potential has important implications in electrophoresis calculations .",
    "the standard electrophoresis theory @xcite is based on the pb prediction for @xmath1 and , hence , important differences should be found if the hnc / msa theory is applied to the electrophoresis problem .",
    "recently , lozada - cassou _ et al._@xcite extended the electrophoresis theory to include ionic size effects , through the hnc / msa theory .",
    "it was applied to spherical macroions . a mobility reversal and a very non - linear behavior of the mobility , as a function of the @xmath1-potential , were predicted .",
    "these predictions were found to be in agreement with experimental results .",
    "contrary to the standard electrophoresis theory , the mobility was shown to be non - universal .",
    "this is due , precisely , to the non - monotonic behavior of the @xmath1-potential .",
    "the hnc / msa and mc simulations for spherical and planar macroions do not show a maximum in @xmath115 as pronounced as that reported here for the cylindrical geometry . therefore , we believe that our hnc / msa and md results are particularly relevant .    in view of the qualitative agreement between hnc / msa and md and the quantitative and qualitative disagreement of these with poisson - boltzmann theory , we conclude that for concentrated and divalent electrolytes , influenced by charged polyelectrolytes , the size correlations must be taken properly into account to describe the cylindrical double layer .",
    "our md results clearly indicate that overcharging strongly depends on the system excluded volume , as proposed by some of us @xcite .",
    "while maximum overcharging does not seem to have a limit , the minimum conditions to have overcharging depend on many different ways in which ionic charge , size and concentration , and surface charge density participate in a system , as we showed in figs .",
