    "in the theory of superconductivity and superfluidity bcs model is very familiar and useful to analyse their properties[1].if we assume the @xmath2 function type intearction between fermions it is not difficult to solve the gap equation and its dependence of the coupling constant.however we have not been known the reason why the electron pair form a bound state.on the other hand there exisists solutions of bethe - salpeter equation in the ladder approximation for fermion - fermion pair with discrete spectrum[2].recently a bound state for quasi partices(exiton ) are considered in terms of approximate bethe - salpeter(bs ) equation in qed@xmath0 for phase flucuating d - wave superconductor near the node to measure the resonant spin response[3].the schrdinger type equation for particle - hole boundstate with potential @xmath3 was derived and the eigenvalue condition emerged.its solution indicates the exsitence of strong coupling phase but seems to be not normalizable.therefore it is interesting to apply relativistic bs equation for fermion pair in the same approximation in[2].we think that it is important to solve the equation for the massless boundstate which signals the instability of the vacuum under condensation of these bosons in field thoretical model[4].in this work first we examine the existence of solutions for the massless boundstates which are normalizable.since scalar - vector sector is written by coupled integral equation , it is difficult to solve the equation explicitly.therefore we approximate the equation for the large and small momentum region separately.these equations are easily solved in position space and we have a correct short and long - distance behaviour.for fa system the baundary condition at the origin leads dimensionless coupling constant @xmath4 integer where @xmath5 a fermion mass.in section ii we introduce spinor - spinor bs equation and show their solutions in qed and qed@xmath0[2].in section iii we compare the solutions of dyson - schwinger equation for the fermion propagator with axialscalar solutions of bs equation.in our approximation they obey the same equation and ward - takahashi - identity for axial currents is satisfied.section iv is devoted for summary .",
