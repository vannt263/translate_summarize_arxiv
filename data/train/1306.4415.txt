    "our understanding of the star formation history ( sfh ) in the universe continues to be refined with improving measurement techniques and a broader coverage in redshift  now extending out to @xmath12 .",
    "however , direct star formation rate ( sfr ) measurements are quite challenging at these high redshifts , particularly towards the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function . using ultraviolet and far - infrared observations ,",
    "hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ) constrained the cosmic sfh out to @xmath13 , and found that the sfr rapidly increases at @xmath14 , remains almost constant in the redshift range @xmath15 , and then shows a steep decline with slope @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "the sharp drop at @xmath17 may be due to significant dust extinction at such high redshifts .",
    "li ( 2008 ) derived the sfr out to @xmath18 by adding new ultraviolet measurements and obtained a shallower decay ( @xmath19 ) in this range .",
    "the high-_z _ sfr has also been constrained using observations of color - selected lyman break galaxies ( lbg ; bouwens et al . 2008 ; mannucci et al . 2007 ;",
    "verma et al .",
    "2007 ) and ly@xmath20 emitters ( lae ; ota et al . 2008 ) .",
    "several of the more prominent sfr determinations are summarized in figure  [ sfh ] below .",
    "one can see from this plot that , due to the inherent difficulty of making and interpreting these measurements , the various determinations can disagree with each other even after taking the uncertainties into account .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous transient events in the cosmos . owing to their high luminosity , grbs can be detected out to the edge of the visible universe , constituting a powerful tool for probing the cosmic star formation rate from a different perspective , i.e. , by studying the death rate of massive stars rather than observing them directly during their lives . since the successful launch of the _ swift _ satellite ,",
    "the number of measured grb redshifts has increased rapidly , and thus a reliable statistical analysis is now possible .",
    "the statistical analysis on the grb redshift distributions have been well investigated ( e.g. shao et al .",
    "2011 ; robertson & ellis 2012 ; dado & dar 2013 ) .",
    "it is believed that long bursts ( lgrbs ) with durations @xmath21 s ( where @xmath22 is the time over which @xmath23 of the prompt emission was observed ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "1993 ) are powered by the core collapse of massive stars ( e.g. , woosley 1993a ; paczynski 1998 ; woosley & bloom 2006 ) , an idea given strong support by several confirmed associations between lgrbs and supernovae ( stanek et al . 2003 ; hjorth et al . 2003 ; chornock et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "( see   4.2 ) .",
    "some observationally - determined sfrs are also shown for comparison . ]",
    "this scenario  known as the collapsar model  suggests that the cosmic grb rate should in principle trace the cosmic star formation rate ( totani 1997 ; wijers et al .",
    "1998 ; blain & natarajan 2000 ; lamb & reichart 2000 ; porciani & madau 2001 ; piran 2004 ; zhang & mszros 2004 ; zhang 2007 ) .",
    "however , observations seem to indicate that the rate of lgrbs does not strictly follow the sfr , but instead increases with cosmic redshift faster than the sfr , especially at high-_z _ ( daigne et al . 2006 ; le & dermer 2007 ; yksel & kistler et al . 2007 ; salvaterra & chincarini 2007 ; guetta & piran 2007 ; li 2008 ; kistler et al . 2008 ; salvaterra et al . 2009 , 2012 ) .",
    "this has led to the introduction of several possible mechanisms that could produce such an observed enhancement to the grb rate ( daigne et al .",

    "; robertson & ellis 2012 ; elliott et al .",
    "the idea that appears to have gained some traction is the possibility that the difference between the grb rate and the sfr is due to an enhanced evolution parameterized as @xmath24 ( kistler et al .",
    "2008 ) , which may encompass the effects of cosmic metallicity evolution ( langer & norman 2006 ; li 2008 ) , an evolution in the stellar initial mass function ( xu & wei 2009 ; wang & dai 2011 ) , and possible selection effects ( see , e.g. , coward et al .",
    "2008 , 2013 ; lu et al . 2012 ) .    of course",
    ", if we knew the mechanism responsible for the difference between the grb rate and the sfr , we could constrain the high-_z _ sfr very accurately using the grb data alone . this limitation notwithstanding , grbs have indeed already been used to estimate the sfr in several instances , including the following representative cases : chary et al .",
    "( 2007 ) estimated a lower limit to the sfr of @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 at @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , using deep observations of three @xmath32 grbs with the _ spitzer _ space telescope ; yksel et al .",

    "( 2011 ) used the principal component analysis method to measure the high-_z _ sfr from the grb data and found that the level of star formation activity at @xmath38 could have been already as high as the present - day one ( @xmath39 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 ) .",
    "the question of how the grb redshift distribution is related to the sfh is clearly still not completely answered , but there is an additional important ingredient that has hitherto been ignored in this ongoing discussion  the impact on this relationship from the assumed cosmological expansion itself .",
    "our principal goal in this paper is to update and enlarge the grb sample using the latest catalog of 254 _ swift _ lgrbs in order to carry out a comparative analysis between @xmath0cdm and the @xmath1 universe .",

    "we find that a high-_z _ sfr with slope @xmath73 is required to reproduce both the observed @xmath46 and @xmath59 distributions ( green dashed lines in figure  5 ) .",
    "again using the aic model selection criterion , we find that this model is somewhat disfavored statistically compared to the other two @xmath1 models , with a relative probability of @xmath74 .",
    "this model assumes that the grb rate is proportional to the star formation history with an additional evolution in cosmic metallicity ( i.e. , @xmath62 \\propto \\theta[\\epsilon , z]$ ] ) . for @xmath0cdm , we find that a high-@xmath46 sfr with index @xmath7 and a metallicity evolution parameter @xmath75 fits the data best ( blue solid lines in figure  4 ) .",
    "the @xmath76 for this fit is @xmath77 . in general , fitting the observations with this model produces better consistency than the non - evolution model .",
    "according to the aic , the metallicity evolution model in @xmath0cdm is slightly disfavored compared to the more general density evolution model , but the differences are statistically insignificant ( @xmath78 for the former versus @xmath69 for the latter ) .",
    "we conclude that in the context of @xmath0cdm , the required density evolution may be due to an evolving metallicity .    in the context of the @xmath1 universe ,",

    "this model is represented by the blue solid lines in figure  5 .",
    "the aic shows that the likelihood of this model being correct is @xmath81 compared to the other two @xmath1 models examined above .",
    "unlike the situation with @xmath0cdm , here there is a clear indication that abundance evolution is required to account for the sfr / grb data .",
    "we have used the cumulative redshift distribution of the latest sample of _ swift _ grbs above a fixed luminosity limit , together with the star formation history over the interval @xmath82 , to compare the predictions of @xmath0cdm and the @xmath83 universe . with @xmath0cdm as the background spacetime , earlier work had already demonstrated that in this cosmology the sfr underproduces the grb rate density at high redshifts . it has been suggested that this effect can be understood if a modest evolution , parameterized as @xmath84 , is included ; we have confirmed in both @xmath0cdm and @xmath1 that this factor may be readily explained as an evolution in metallicity .",
    "however , we have also found that a comparison with the observational data shows that a relatively high metallicity cut ( @xmath3 in @xmath0cdm and @xmath8 in @xmath1 ) is required , in contrast to previous work that suggested lgrbs occur preferentially in low metallicity environments , i.e. , @xmath4 .    for both cosmologies",
    ", we have shown that if these results are correct , then by assuming that such trends continue beyond @xmath85 , the adoption of a simple power - law approximation for the high-_z _ ( @xmath5 ) sfr , i.e. , @xmath6^{\\alpha}$ ] , we may also constrain the slope @xmath20 using the grb data . we have found for @xmath0cdm that the sfr at @xmath86 shows a decay with slope @xmath7 . and using a simple relationship between the grb rate density and the sfr , including an evolution in metallicity , we have demonstrated that the @xmath46 and @xmath59 distributions of 244 _ swift _ grbs can be well fitted by our updated sfh , using a threshold in the metallicity for grb production .",
    "the best fit for the redshift distribution of the _ swift _ grbs in the @xmath1 universe requires a slightly different rate than that in @xmath0cdm , though still with an additional evolutionary effect , which could be a high metallicity cut of @xmath8 .",
    "assuming that the grb rate is related to the sfr with this evolving metallicity , we have found that in the @xmath1 universe the slope of the high-_z _ sfr would be @xmath9 .",
    "the principal goal of this work has been to directly compare the predictions of @xmath0cdm and @xmath1 and their ability to account for the grb / sfr observations . aside from the issue of whether or not the grb - redshift distribution is consistent with the sfr in either model , we have also examined which of these two cosmologies fits the data better , and is therefore statistically preferred by the aikake information criterion in a one - on - one comparison .    to keep the complexity of this problem manageable ,",
    "we have chosen to find the best fits to the data by optimizing four free parameters ( @xmath20 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) , though the models themselves were held fixed by the concordance values of @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and the dark - energy equation - of - state in the case of @xmath0cdm , and the same value of @xmath90 for @xmath1 .",
    "the two models produce very similar profiles in the distance - redshift relationship ( melia 2012a ; wei et al .",
    "2013 ) , so it is not very surprising to see that both can account quite well for the observed sfr - grb rate correlation .",
    "however , the aic does not favor these models equally . from table 2",
    ", we find that a direct comparison between the best @xmath0cdm fit ( entry 2 in this table ) and the best @xmath1 fit ( entry 6 ) favors the latter with a relative probability @xmath93 versus @xmath94 for the standard model .",
    "if we further assume that the required evolutionary effect is indeed due to changes in metallicity , so that we now compare entries 3 and 6 in table 2 , then the aic favors @xmath1 with a relative probability @xmath95 versus @xmath96 for @xmath0cdm .",
    "however , if the required evolutinary effect is simply due to density and not changes in metallicity ( entries 2 and 5 ) , the aic favors @xmath0cdm with a relative probability of @xmath97 versus @xmath98 for @xmath1 .",
    "the statistical significance of these likelihoods has been investigated theoretically , e.g. , by yanagihara & ohmoto ( 2005 ) .",
    "its variability has also been studied empirically ; for example , by repeatedly comparing @xmath0cdm to other cosmological models on the basis of data sets generated by a bootstrap method ( tan & biswas 2012 ) .",
    "it is known that the aic is increasingly accurate when the number of data points is large , but it is felt that in all cases , the magnitude of the difference @xmath99 should provide a numerical assessment of the evidence that model  1 is to be preferred over model  2 .",
    "a  rule of thumb that has been used in the literature is that if @xmath100 , it is mildly strong ; and if @xmath101 , it is quite strong .",
    "therefore , our conclusion from the comparative study we have reported here is that  based on the currently available grb / sfr observations  the @xmath1 universe is mildly favored over @xmath0cdm in a one - on - one comparison if the required evolution is due to changes in metallicity ( for which @xmath102 ) .",
    "however , @xmath0cdm is mildly favored over @xmath1 ( with @xmath103 ) if instead the evolution is with density .",
    "the prevailing view at the moment seems to be that changes in metallicity are responsible for the required evolution so , in this context , the grb / sfr data tend to be more consistent with the predictions of @xmath1 than those of the concordance model .",
    "note that the likelihood estimates we have made here were based on the use of priors for @xmath0cdm .",
    "were we to optimize @xmath90 along with the other four parameters ( for both models ) , and @xmath91 , @xmath92 and the dark - energy equation of state for @xmath0cdm , we could certainly lower their @xmath104 for the best fits , but the aic strongly penalizes models with many free parameters .",
    "the @xmath104 values listed for @xmath0cdm in table 2 would need to decrease by at least 6 in order to compensate for the increase due to the factor @xmath105 in the expression @xmath106 .",
    "this seems unlikely since the fits using the concordance model are already rather good .",
    "refinements in future measurements of the grb rate and sfr may show that the currently believed explanation for their differences ( i.e. , an evolution in metallicity ) is incorrect . in that case ,",
    "a reassessment of these comparisons may produce different results .",
    "as of now , however , it appears that the sfr underproduces the observed grb rate unless some additional evolution were present to broaden their disparity with increasing redshift .",
    "we have found that such an evolution is consistent with a relatively high metallicity cutoff for the lgrbs .",
