    "<S> we give an exact solution for the static force between two black holes at the turning points in their binary motion . </S>",
    "<S> the results are derived by gibbs principle and the bekenstein - hawking entropy applied to the apparent horizon surfaces in time - symmetric initial data . </S>",
    "<S> new power laws are derived for the entropy jump in mergers , while newton s law is shown to derive from a new adiabatic variational principle for the hilbert action in the presence of apparent horizon surfaces . in this approach , entropy is strictly monotonic such that gravity is attractive for all separations including mergers , and the bekenstein entropy bound is satisfied also at arbitrarily large separations , where gravity reduces to newton s law . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is generalized to point particles in the newtonian limit by application of gibbs principle to world - lines crossing light cones . </S>"
