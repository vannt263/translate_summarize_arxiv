    "long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have been linked to the deaths of massive stars , and hence to star formation activity , through their association with star forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and with type ic supernova explosions ( e.g. , @xcite ) . across a wide range of cosmic history a substantial fraction of the star formation activity ( @xmath15 at the peak of the star formation history , @xmath16 )",
    "is obscured by dust , with about 15% of the total star formation rate density occurring in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", we expect some grbs to occur in dusty environments that will diminish or completely extinguish their optical ( and perhaps even near - ir ) afterglow emission .",
    "such events can be used as signposts for the locations and relative fraction of obscured star formation across a wide redshift range .",
    "in addition , they can provide insight into the role of metallicity in grb progenitors since dusty environments generally require substantial metallicity .",
    "these so - called optically - dark grbs are indeed known to exist ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but the lack of an optical detection does not necessarily point to dust obscuration .",
    "most prosaically , the lack of detected optical emission may be due to inefficient follow - up observations , or to intrinsically dim events ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another potential origin of dark bursts is a high redshift , with the optical emission suppressed by ly@xmath17 absorption at @xmath18@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "such events are clearly of great interest since a dropout above @xmath20 @xmath21 m points to @xmath22 , while events which are also dark in the near - ir can potentially arise at @xmath23 ( @xmath24-band dropout ) .",
    "naturally , high redshift bursts will also lack host galaxy detections in the optical band . on the other hand",
    ", their afterglow emission redward of the ly@xmath17 break will follow the expected synchrotron spectrum ( @xmath25 ) with @xmath26 @xcite .    to determine whether a burst is genuinely dark , due to extinction or to a high redshift rather than to an inefficient search , it is common to compare the observed limits with the expected optical / near - ir brightness based on the x - ray afterglow .",
    "this approach relies on the simple power law shape of the afterglow synchrotron emission .",
    "one definition of dark bursts uses an optical to x - ray spectral index of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the slope of the synchrotron spectrum in log space ; see @xcite for details ) , since this is the shallowest expected slope in the standard afterglow model .",
    "a variant of this condition uses knowledge of the x - ray spectral index ( @xmath29 ) , and defines bursts as dark if @xmath30 @xcite , since this is the shallowest expected relative slope .",
    "these definitions can reveal evidence for dust extinction even if an optical afterglow is detected .",
    "this approach has been used by several groups to identify and study dark bursts . in the pre-  sample @xcite found that about 10% of the bursts are dark , while @xcite found a mean extinction of @xmath31 mag , indicating that most events are not dark .",
    "@xcite studied several bursts with  x - ray and uv / optical detections and found a mean extinction level of @xmath32 mag , and that bursts which are dark blueward of @xmath33-band are likely to have rest - frame extinction about an order of magnitude larger .",
    "@xcite used rapid optical observations of 63  bursts and found that about 50% showed evidence of mild extinction .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite based on rapid optical observations of 29  bursts , with an 80% detection fraction , but with roughly half exhibiting suppression with respect to the x - ray emission .",
    "a follow - up study of the latter sample by @xcite aimed at identifying host galaxies in the optical ( thereby ruling out a high redshift origin ) and found that @xmath34 of  bursts are located at @xmath22 .",
    "the majority of the dark bursts in their sample instead require @xmath35 mag , with a few cases reaching @xmath36 mag .",
    "@xcite studied a complete sample of 58 bright  bursts , of which 52 have known redshifts and found that the fraction of dark bursts is about 30% , mainly due to extinction ( nearly all the dark bursts in their sample have @xmath0 ) .",
    "thus , the afterglow emission of @xmath37 of all grbs are affected by dust , although in most cases the required extinction is modest , @xmath32 mag @xcite .",
    "there are only a few known cases with large extinction of @xmath38 mag .",
    "concurrent studies of the neutral hydrogen column density distribution , inferred from the x - ray afterglow spectra , suggest that dark bursts exhibit systematically larger values of @xmath39 @xmath6 compared to bursts with little or no extinction , which have a median of @xmath40 @xmath6 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the measured extinction for grbs is generally lower than expected based on the values of @xmath41 and the galactic @xmath7 relation , previously attributed to dust destruction by the bright x - ray / uv emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    finally , the host galaxies of at least some dark bursts appear to be redder , more luminous , more massive , and more metal rich than the hosts of optically - bright grbs @xcite , potentially indicating that the extinction is interstellar in origin rather than directly associated with the burst environment .",
    "one specific example is grb030115 , not only one of the first examples of a heavily extinguished grb afterglow , but residing in a host classified as an extremely red object ( ero ; @xcite ) .",
    "some host galaxies of optically - bright bursts have been detected in the radio and ( sub)millimeter ranges ( e.g. , @xcite , indicating obscured star formation rates of @xmath42 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the dust distribution within the host galaxies is patchy and that not all grbs in dusty host galaxies are necessarily dust - obscured @xcite .",
    "further work by @xcite indicates that dark grb host galaxies may be systematically redder and more massive than optically bright grb host galaxies and have lower metallicity than sub - millimeter galaxies , leading to prior biases in grb host galaxy population studies .",
    "here we present multi - wavelength observations that reveal two of the darkest known bursts to date , grbs 110709b and 111215a .",
    "these events have such large rest - frame extinction that they lack any afterglow detection in the optical and near - ir bands ( to @xmath43 @xmath21 m ) despite rapid follow - up .",
    "however , both events are detected in the radio , providing sub - arcsecond positions and secure associations with host galaxies detected in the optical .",
    "this allows us to rule out a high redshift origin , while the combination of radio and x - ray data place robust lower limits on the rest - frame extinction , with @xmath2 and @xmath44 mag ( for @xmath4 ) , respectively .",
    "the radio and x - ray data also allow us to determine the explosion properties and the circumburst densities .",
    "this study demonstrates that radio detections with the jvla , and soon the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , provide a promising path to accurate localization of dark grbs , robust estimates of the extinction in the absence of any optical / near - ir detections , and a comparative study of their explosion properties and parsec - scale environments .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the multi - wavelength observations of grbs 110709b and 111215a and their host galaxies in  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "these observations establish that both events are dark due to extinction .",
    "we model the radio and x - ray data to extract the minimum required extinction , as well as the explosion and circumburst properties in  [ sec : model ] . in  [ sec : disc ] we place the large inferred extinction values and the inferred burst properties within the framework of existing samples of optically - bright and dark bursts .",
    "we summarize the results and note key future directions in  [ sec : conc ] . throughout the paper",
    "we report magnitudes in the ab system ( unless otherwise noted ) and use galactic extinction values of @xmath45 mag for grb110709b and @xmath46 mag for grb111215a @xcite .",

    "to determine the redshift of the host we obtained an 1800  s spectrum with lris , using a @xmath197 slit with the 400/3400 grism in the blue arm and the 400/8500 grating in the red arm , providing effectively continuous wavelength coverage from the atmospheric cutoff to @xmath198   ( with a total throughput within 50% of peak to about 10030  ) .",

    "a correlation between extinction and @xmath252 is known to exist in the milky way and the magellanic clouds , with @xmath253 @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : avnh ] , optically - bright grbs generally have lower values of @xmath240 than would be inferred from this relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with mean values of @xmath254 @xmath6 and @xmath255 mag ; the expected extinction based on the galactic relation is @xmath256 mag .",
    "dark grbs also generally have lower extinction than expected , with @xmath257 @xmath6 and @xmath258 mag , whereas extinctions of @xmath259 mag would be expected .    for the bursts presented here we find potentially different results .",

    "broad - band modeling indicates a beaming - corrected energy of @xmath287 erg , and a circumburst density characterized by @xmath288 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the beaming - corrected energy inferred for grbs 110709b and 111215a , @xmath8 erg , is not unusual for long grbs , although it is somewhat higher than the median value of @xmath289 erg ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the inferred densities are substantial , with inferred mass loss rates of about @xmath290 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 ( 110709b ) and @xmath291 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 ( 111215a ) . at the radii appropriate for the jet break times of the two bursts , @xmath292 cm @xcite",
    ", these mass loss rates correspond to particle densities of about 100 and 350 @xmath13 , respectively , higher than typical values for long grbs , which are @xmath293 @xmath13 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if confirmed with future detailed observations of dark bursts , the high densities may be indicative of larger mass loss rates for long grbs in dusty , and hence metal rich environments .",
    "such a trend may be expected if the mass loss is driven by radiation pressure mediated by metal lines @xcite .",
    "the durations of grb110709b ( @xmath294 s ) and grb111215a ( @xmath295 s ) are extremely long .",
    "to assess whether this type of unusually long duration correlates with optical / near - ir darkness , we collect all  bursts with durations of @xmath296  s , excluding nearby sub - energetic grbs ( e.g. , xrf060218 , grb100316d ) .",
    "the sample includes 9 events of which three bursts are dark ( 060929 , 110709b , 111215a ) , five have optical and/or near - ir detections with no clear evidence for extinction , and one event lacks rapid follow - up observations .",
    "thus , at least @xmath297 of these events are dark , similar to the fraction of dark bursts in the overall long grb population .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no obvious correlation between unusually long duration and darkness , with the caveat that the current sample size is small .",
    "using x - ray , optical / near - ir , and radio observations we have demonstrated that : ( i ) grbs 110709b and 111215a are dark bursts ;",
    "( ii ) they are robustly associated with galaxies at @xmath0 ( 110709b ) and @xmath1 ( 111215a ) ; ( iii ) they require unusually large rest - frame extinction of @xmath2 mag ( 110709b ) and @xmath245 mag ( 111215a ) at @xmath4 ; ( iv ) they exhibit commensurately large neutral hydrogen column densities in their x - ray spectra , @xmath298 @xmath6 , which at @xmath299 are consistent with the galactic @xmath273 relation , unlike the overall long grb population ; and ( v ) their circumburst environments on a sub - parsec scale are shaped by large progenitor mass loss rates of @xmath300 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 .    radio observations played a critical role in this study for three reasons .",
    "first , they provided sub - arcsecond positions , which led to a secure identification of the host galaxies .",
    "this allowed us to distinguish the extinction scenario from a high - redshift origin .",
    "second , the combination of radio and x - ray data allowed us to robustly determine the required extinction , instead of simply assuming an optical to x - ray spectral index .",
    "indeed , in cases with only x - ray data the unknown location of the synchrotron cooling frequency prevents a unique determination of the extinction .",
    "finally , the radio and x - ray data allowed us to determine the burst parameters , including the geometry , beaming - corrected energy , and the circumburst density .",
    "we find that the energy scale for grbs 110709b and 111215a is similar to the overall population of optically - bright grbs .",
    "however , the inferred mass loss rates are larger by about an order magnitude compared to optically - bright bursts , potentially indicating that grb progenitors in dusty environments have stronger metal line driven winds .",
    "the increased sensitivity of the jvla played an important role in the study and utilization of the radio afterglow .",
    "alma will provide similar capabilities , with an expected spatial resolution of about @xmath301 at 100 ghz ( depending on configuration ) , and hence an assured sub - arcsecond centroiding accuracy for signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath302 even in the most compact configuration . as demonstrated here ,  observations can also provide sub - arcsecond positions , but such observations may not be available for all dark grb candidates ( e.g. , grb111215a ) .",
    "in addition ,  data will not enhance the ability to determine the required extinction through broad - band modeling .",
    "the jvla and alma will also allow us to study the host galaxies of grbs 110709b and 111215a ( as well as those of past and future dark bursts ) in greater detail than optical / near - ir studies alone .",
    "in particular , they will address the question of highly - obscured star formation in these galaxies , and may even lead to redshift determinations through the detection of molecular lines .",
    "existing observations with the vla and the mambo and scuba bolometers ( in the small samples published to - date ) have led to only a few detections of grb hosts @xcite , with no obvious preference for dark burst hosts @xcite .",
    "however , the enhanced sensitivity of alma will allow for detections even with star formation rates of tens of m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 at @xmath179 .",
    "the combination of detailed host galaxy properties from rest - frame radio to uv , coupled with measurements of the local environments of dark bursts through broad - band afterglow modeling will shed light on the location of the obscuring dust ( interstellar vs.  circumstellar ) and the impact of metallicity on grb progenitor formation .",

    "<S> the combination of x - ray detections and deep optical / near - ir limits establish both bursts as `` dark '' . </S>",
    "<S> sub - arcsecond positions enabled by radio detections lead to robust host galaxy associations , with optical detections that indicate @xmath0 ( 110709b ) and @xmath1 ( 111215a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that both bursts are dark due to substantial rest - frame extinction . using the radio and x - ray data for each burst we find that grb110709b requires @xmath2 mag and grb111215a requires @xmath3 mag ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , the inferred values are in agreement with the galactic @xmath7 relation , unlike the bulk of the grb population . finally , we find that for both bursts the afterglow emission is best explained by a collimated outflow with a total beaming - corrected energy of @xmath8 erg ( @xmath4 ) expanding into a wind medium with a high density , @xmath9 m@xmath10 yr@xmath11 ( @xmath12 @xmath13 at @xmath14 cm ) . while the energy release is typical of long grbs , the inferred density may be indicative of larger mass loss rates for grb progenitors in dusty ( and hence metal rich ) environments . </S>",
    "<S> this study establishes the critical role of radio observations in demonstrating the origin and properties of dark grbs . </S>",
    "<S> observations with the jvla and alma will provide a sample with sub - arcsecond positions and robust host associations that will help to shed light on obscured star formation and the role of metallicity in grb progenitors . </S>"
