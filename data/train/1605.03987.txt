    "the cells follow the strain orientation on average . however , the cells that apply active contractile forces on the matrix followed the orientation with much higher accuracy , as evidenced by the much smaller standard deviations .",

    "cells protrude in all directions @xcite and thus they can not orient along a specific angle .    altogether , the simulated contractile cells aligned with the strain more accurately than the non - contractile cells .",
    "this can be explained by a positive feedback loop between cell shape , cell traction forces and strain stiffening .",
    "cells elongate slightly in response to uniaxial stretch . due to the anisotropic cell shape , cells pull harder on the matrix around the tip of the cells , since the distance between the tip of the cell and the cell interior increases ( see eq .",

    "cell forces can not sufficiently amplify a small uniaxial stretch and thus more uniaxial stretch is needed to instigate string formation .",
    "however , at higher uniaxial stretch , the cell traction forces are insufficiently strong to amplify the uniaxial strain and as a result cells do not form strings . note that these cells do not form networks with little uniaxial stretch , as they do not sufficiently contract the matrix to align with other cells . if cells are highly contractile ( last row in figure  [ fig : fig5]a ) they form networks , similar to cells on non - stretched matrices ( figure  [ fig : modeloverview]f ) .",
    "higher uniaxial stretching transforms a network into an oriented network ( figure  [ fig : fig5]e ) and subsequently into strings .",
    "indeed , the global order has a biphasic dependence on stretching ( last set of barplots in figure  [ fig : fig5]b ) .",
    "this is because with too little uniaxial stretch , cell generated strains dominate the global strain cue and thus cells do not collectively orient .",
    "of course , if we would increase uniaxial stretch even more , cells would align but not form strings anymore .    to better understand the results in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] , recall that cells extend towards areas that are stiffened by strain , as described by the sigmoid function @xmath37 ( figure s5b ) , where @xmath106 .",
    "figure s5a shows that cells can only form strings when the matrix is stiffened to values above @xmath38 ( figure s5d ) .",

    "this shows that when the uniaxial stretch stiffens the matrix to values around @xmath38 and cell traction forces then stiffen the matrix more , strings can be formed .",
    "however , strings can not be formed when the matrix is stiffened too much by either the cells or the uniaxial stretch .    altogether ,",
    "the results suggest that an optimal balance between uniaxial stretch and cell contractility is needed for cells to form strings .",

    "we investigated this issue further in the supporting material and address this in the discussion section .",
    "in this paper we have presented a computational model to show that active cell contraction can facilitate cellular alignment to the orientation of static uniaxial stretch .",
    "the computational model describes motile cells living on top of an elastic substrate , and is based on only a few , experimentally validated assumptions : ( a ) cells exert contractile forces on the substrate , which locally generate strains in the substrate @xcite ; ( b ) cells move by repeatedly attempting to extend or retract pseudopods at random , and ( c ) along the substrate strain orientation , pseudopod extensions are promoted and pseudopod retractions are inhibited @xcite , a procedure mimicking the maturation of focal adhesions under strain @xcite .",
    "we have shown previously @xcite that these assumptions suffice to reproduce ( 1 ) the elongation of single cells on compliant substrates , ( 2 ) the alignment of two adjacent cells , and at the collective level ( 3 ) the formation of vascular - like network structures and angiogenesis - like sprouting structures . here",

    "@xcite and figure  [ fig : fig6 ] ) .",

    "contractility makes cells elongate more strongly ( figure  [ fig : fig2]b ) , and allows them to respond to strain cues more accurately ( figure  [ fig : fig2]c ) and more rapidly ( figure  [ fig : fig2]d ) than non - contractile cells .",
    "thus , a crucial factor for these phenomena is the balance between active cell contractility and the magnitude of the uniaxial stretch cue .",
    "provided the cellular traction forces are sufficiently strong , the cells will collectively organize into oriented strings even in response to very subtle strain cues ( figure  [ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "for stronger cell contractility , however , the local strains will override the global strain cue and the cells will organize into network - like patterns as reported previously ( see figure  [ fig : fig5]a , lower left panels ; also cf .",

    "the reported model behavior holds for substrates with stiffness of approximately @xmath121 to approximately @xmath122 , a wider range than the autonomous cell elongation reported previously @xcite .",

    "uniaxial stretching experiments where cell - seeding densities are varied and cell - cell adhesion is controlled , by inhibiting or knocking out cadherins , could validate these predictions .",
    "although our model is currently not resolved to molecular detail , its simulation results do suggest a mechanistic explanation for the response of cells to static uniaxial stretch .",
    "previous theoretical models @xcite proposed that cells actively regulate their orientation in order to optimize a local mechanical property . bischofs and schwarz @xcite represented cells as active dipoles , and showed that the dipole can minimize the amount of work required to contract the matrix by orienting along the external strain @xcite .",
    "this optimization principle was motivated by force - induced focal adhesion maturation : maximum forces will develop at the focal adhesions that are displaced the least .",
    "based on observations suggesting that cells maintain a constant local stress in their microenvironment , de _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed that dipolar cells actively regulate their orientation and contractility in order to maintain a constant optimal amount of local stresses in the matrix . in this model ,",
    "the dipolar cells reorient to the uniaxial stretch and gradually reduce the magnitude of their contractility in order to reduce the stress in the matrix .",
    "mechanistic rationales certainly motivated these optimization principles , but the mechanisms were not modelled explicitly and a dipole shape was presumed .",
    "our approach instead aims to derive single - cell phenomena and collective cellular responses to strain from a small set of experimentally plausible assumptions at the subcellular level .",
    "the present work is only a first step towards this aim .",
    "currently , the local substrate strains regulate the protrusion and retraction probabilities based on a phenomenological function ( eq .  [ eq : strain ] ) , which simulates focal adhesion maturation . in our ongoing work we are refining this part of the model by introducing explicit kinetic models of the focal adhesions .",
    "the current , coarse - grained description has suggested new mechanisms for the experimental observations listed above , but due to a number of technical limitations it still fails to reproduce others .",
    "we can not yet reproduce cell alignment to uniaxial stretch in a completely confluent layer , because the strain - bias of the cell protrusions and retractions is cancelled out at cell - cell interfaces ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : strain ] and figures  s7a and  s7b ) . as a first exploration of the behavior of our model in absence of this effect",
    ", we ran a series of simulations in which we differentiated the probability of the retractions relative to extensions . with an decreased retraction probability ( @xmath125 ) , fully confluent cell layers collectively oriented in parallel to stretch ( figures  s7c and  s7d ) . in contrast , in simulations with an increased retraction probability ( @xmath126 ) , the cells oriented themselves perpendicular to the stretch orientations in a confluent layer ( figures  s7e and  s7f ) .",
    "another result of the absence of strain - effects at cell - cell boundaries , is that contractile cells do not achieve a high global ordering within strings ( figure  [ fig : fig4]a ) ; this is because cells in the interior of the strings do not elongate .",
    "when the retraction probability is decreased ( @xmath125 ) , the contractile cells reach a higher global ordering ( @xmath127 ) compared to the non - contractile cells ( @xmath128 ) ( figure  s8a ) . in simulations",
    "in which the retraction probability is increased ( @xmath126 ) , the contractile cells reached a lower global ordering ( @xmath129 ) compared to the non - contractile cells ( @xmath130 ) , as some cells in the interior of strings started to align perpendicular to strain ( figure  s8b ) . despite these quantitative differences ,",
    "note that cells form strings irrespective of the specific modeling choices ( figure s8 c and d ) . also related to",
    "this modeling choice is the apparent unrealistic cell shape as presented in figure s2c .",
    "such cells appear less frequently in simulations where retraction probabilities are decreased ( @xmath125 ) ( figure s8 c and d ) ) .",
    "this work primarily focused on the collective behavior of cells ; in our ongoing work we are developing more detailed , single - cell models .",
    "apart from this course - graining of the focal adhesion dynamics and cell motility , our model also relies on other methodological simplifications .",
    "the finite - element description of the substrate assumes that the ecm is isotropic , non - fibrous , and linearly elastic .",
    "because of these assumptions , our model best applies to non - fibrous matrices ( _ e.g. _ , synthetic polyacrylamide matrices ) , or to matrices with fibers much smaller than the size of the cells .",
    "of course , more complex matrix mechanics can be modelled using fem approaches .",
    "interestingly , aghvami _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who modelled an anisotropic fiber reinforced material showed similar increased local strains around ( non - migratory ) cells pulling on uniaxially stretched matrices as in our model .",
    "alternative , agent - based approaches have been proposed for fibrous matrices @xcite ; in comparison to these models , an advantage of our hybrid approach is in particular its scalability to multicellular systems . as a disadvantage relative to these agent - based approaches , our hybrid set - up relies on an operator splitting approach , which alternates updates of the cell traction forces with the mcs s of the cellular potts model . although this process speeds up our computations and operator splitting approaches are routinely applied in hybrid modeling ( see _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it of course also introduces numerical errors : ideally we would recalculate the cellular traction forces and substrate strains after every copy attempt of the cpm . from a biophysical point of view the operator splitting",
    "assumption is valid if we can separate the time - scales of the growth and degradation of focal adhesions , such that cell traction forces remain approximately constant during the time represented by one mcs .",
    "indeed , focal adhesion dynamics occur at a timescale of minutes , which is longer than one mcs , which in our model is equivalent to 0.5 to 3 seconds @xcite .",
    "an ongoing improvement of our approach concerns the coupling between the cellular traction forces , as represented by the fma model ( eq .  [ eq : lemmonromer ] ) , and the representation of these forces in the hamiltonian ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : h ] ) . in the basic cpm ,",
    "the area conservation and adhesive energy terms in the hamiltonian describe a pressure and approximate a membrane tension which together represent cell contractility .",
    "this allowed us to study the effects of cell - cell contact energies .",
    "these terms are not equal to the forces described by the fma model .",
    "the strength of this model is that it produces experimentally validated strain fields .",
    "the decoupling of the cpm and the fma model will become an issue at locations where the two sets of forces are unequal , _",
    "e.g. _ , at cell - cell interfaces and can affect te mesoscopic cell behavior .",
    "since we are interested in how mesoscopic cell behavior affects the macroscopic level , _",
    "i.e. _ , collective behavior , these approximations and decoupling suffice here . in our ongoing work",
    ", we are adopting an approach proposed by albert and schwarz @xcite to alleviate this issue .    in summary , we proposed a local cell - matrix feedback mechanism explaining the reorientation of cells to external stretch . in agreement with experimental observations , in this model cell contractility facilitates the reorientation of cells .",

    "<S> during animal development and homeostasis , the structure of tissues , including muscles , blood vessels and connective tissues adapts to mechanical strains in the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) . </S>",
    "<S> these strains originate from the differential growth of tissues or forces due to muscle contraction or gravity . here </S>",
    "<S> we show using a computational model that by amplifying local strain cues , active cell contractility can facilitate and accelerate the reorientation of single cells to static strains . at the collective cell level , </S>",
    "<S> the model simulations show that active cell contractility can facilitate the formation of strings along the orientation of stretch . </S>",
    "<S> the computational model is based on a hybrid cellular potts and finite - element simulation framework describing a mechanical cell - substrate feedback , where : 1 ) cells apply forces on the ecm , such that 2 ) local strains are generated in the ecm , and 3 ) cells preferentially extend protrusions along the strain orientation . in accordance with experimental observations , </S>",
    "<S> simulated cells align and form string - like structures parallel to static uniaxial stretch . </S>",
    "<S> our model simulations predict that the magnitude of the uniaxial stretch and the strength of the contractile forces regulate a gradual transition between string - like patterns and vascular network - like patterns . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations also suggest that at high population densities , less cell cohesion promotes string formation . </S>"
