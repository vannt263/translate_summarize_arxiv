    "nucleus - nucleus ( a+a ) collisions at relativistic energies have been intensely studied over the last two decades .",
    "the main goal of these efforts is to understand the properties of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of high energy and baryon densities when the creation of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is expected @xcite .",
    "experimental results obtained in a broad range of collision energies indicate that an extended zone of strongly interacting dense matter indeed occurs in the collision process . various collision characteristics and",
    "their collision energy dependence suggest @xcite that a transient state of deconfined matter may be created at collision energies as low as 40 @xmath0gev .",
    "qgp formation is expected to occur at the early collision stage when the system is sufficiently hot and dense . in the course of further evolution ,",
    "the system dilutes and cools down , hadronizes and finally decays into free hadrons .",
    "therefore the final state hadrons carry only indirect information about the early stage of the collision .",
    "thus firm conclusions about the creation of deconfined matter require studying a variety of collision characteristics .    as fluctuations are sensitive to the dynamics of the system , in particular at the phase transition , the analysis of event - by - event fluctuations has been proposed as an important tool in the study of a+a collisions @xcite .",
    "large acceptance detectors , which allow the observation of a significant fraction of the final state particles , have made this suggestion truly attractive @xcite .",
    "first pioneering studies were carried out by the na49 collaboration on the fluctuations of the average transverse momentum @xcite and the @xmath25 ratio @xcite in central pb+pb collisions at the cern sps .",
    "there are a number of collision characteristics which can be inferred from experimental data on event - by - event fluctuations .",
    "first of all , the fluctuation analysis can help to resolve the long standing problem whether , or rather to what extent , the strongly interacting matter , emerging from the early collision stage , achieves both thermal @xcite and chemical @xcite equilibrium . in the na49 investigation of event - wise fluctuations in the @xmath25 ratio @xcite in central pb+pb collisions at 158 @xmath0gev , no significant deviations from the hadro - chemical equilibrium ratio were found .",
    "if the equilibrium is indeed reached , the system s heat capacity @xcite and its compressibility @xcite can , in principle , be deduced from the temperature and multiplicity fluctuations respectively .",
    "while large multiplicity fluctuations can be treated as a signal of particle production via clusters @xcite or super - cooled droplets of deconfined matter @xcite , small final state fluctuations of the conserved charges , electric or baryonic , can occur when fluctuations generated in the plasma phase are frozen due to the rapid expansion of the system @xcite . on the other hand , significant transverse momentum and multiplicity fluctuations can result if the system hadronizes from a qgp near the predicted second order critical qcd end point @xcite .",
    "the latter has been shown by recent lattice qcd studies to occur at a substantial baryochemical potential @xcite , characteristic of the cern sps energy range .",
    "this paper extends the previous study @xcite of the na49 experiment of event - by - event transverse momentum fluctuations .",
    "the main objective is to observe how the fluctuation pattern changes with increasing number of nucleons participating in a collision , i.e. with the system size . for this purpose ,",
    "not only pb+pb collisions at various centralities are studied , but also p+p , c+c and si+si interactions at a beam energy of 158 gev per nucleon . in particular , it will be checked , whether the correlations present in the final state of p+p interactions survive in the collisions of heavier systems , as expected if the nucleus+nucleus ( a+a ) collision is a simple superposition of nucleon+nucleon ( n+n ) interactions .",
    "moreover a test will be performed of the reasonable expectation that the fluctuations become more similar to those of an equilibrated system when the number of participating nucleons increases .",
    "measuring event - by - event fluctuations in a+a collisions one should consider the influence of two trivial sources of fluctuations .",
    "the first one is caused by event - by - event fluctuations of the collision geometry and the second one by the finite number of particles ( statistical fluctuations ) .",
    "the dynamical fluctuations of interest have to be extracted from the noise caused by these trivial sources .",
    "in such a situation , a suitable choice of statistical tools for the study of event - by - event fluctuations is really important . in this work ,",
    "mainly the fluctuation measure @xmath26 introduced in @xcite will be employed .",
    "however , other fluctuation measures have also been proposed and studied , e.g. @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath28 @xcite and @xmath29 @xcite , which can all be related .",
    "@xmath26 equals exactly zero when inter - particle correlations are absent .",
    "it also eliminates ` geometrical ' fluctuations due to the impact parameter variation .",
    "thus , @xmath26 is ` deaf ' to the statistical noise and ` blind ' to the collision centrality .",
    "the @xmath26 measure was already used in the previous experimental study @xcite of @xmath30 fluctuations .",
    "it was also calculated within various models of nuclear collisions @xcite . however , in these model considerations , the effects of experimental acceptance , which significantly influence the results , were usually not taken into account . consequently , most of these results can not be compared to the data .    for better understanding of the structure of the correlations contributing to @xmath26 , two - particle transverse momentum correlations ( as proposed in @xcite ) are studied as well .",
    "a preliminary analysis was presented in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ s : measures ] the statistical tools used in this analysis are introduced and briefly discussed .",
    "the experimental set - up and procedures are presented in sec .",
    "[ s : experiment ] .",
    "experimental effects such as detector acceptance and two - track resolution are discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : data ] .",
    "the results on the system dependence of the @xmath30 fluctuations are presented in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] .",
    "discussion of the results and their comparison with theoretical models is given in sec .",
    "[ s : discussion ] .",
    "a summary closes the paper .",
    "there are numerous observables which can be used to measure @xmath30 fluctuations in high energy collisions .",
    "a natural one is the distribution of the average transverse momentum of the events defined as    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the multiplicity of accepted particles in a given event and @xmath33 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath34-th particle . the distribution of @xmath35 is usually compared to the corresponding distribution obtained for ` mixed events ' in which the particles are independent from each other and follow the experimental inclusive spectra ( the multiplicity distribution for mixed events is the same as for the data ) .",
    "a difference between the two distributions signals the presence of dynamical fluctuations .",
    "since the @xmath35 distribution crucially depends on the particle multiplicity , the method can not be used to compare systems of significantly different multiplicities .",
    "a more appropriate measure is the quantity @xmath26 @xcite which , by its construction , is insensitive to the system size . in this paper",
    "the @xmath26 measure is used for the analysis of @xmath36 fluctuations ( @xmath1 ) . following the authors of @xcite",
    ", one defines the single - particle variable @xmath37 with the bar denoting averaging over the single - particle inclusive distribution .",
    "one easily observes that @xmath38 .",
    "further , one introduces the event variable @xmath39 , which is a multi - particle analog of @xmath40 , defined as @xmath41 where the summation runs over particles in a given event .",
    "note , that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 represents averaging over events . finally , the @xmath1 measure is defined as    @xmath44    the second part of eq .",
    "( [ eq_phi ] ) is simply the dispersion of the inclusive @xmath30 distribution ( further denoted as @xmath45 ) .",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath46 , when no inter - particle correlations are present and the single - particle spectrum is independent of multiplicity .",
    "as already mentioned , @xmath1 is insensitive to centrality .",
    "this property may be expressed as follows : @xmath1 is independent of the distribution of the number of particle sources if the sources are identical and independent from each other @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xmath1 does not depend on the impact parameter if the a+a collision is a simple superposition of n+n interactions .    in spite of the above mentioned advantages , there is an important disadvantage of using @xmath1 in the fluctuation analysis .",
    "while @xmath1 is sensitive to the presence of dynamical correlations in a system , it does not disentangle their nature .",
    "fluctuations of very different character contribute to @xmath1 . in order to achieve a better understanding of the fluctuation structure one needs to apply a more differential method @xcite .",
    "the correlations can be studied by plotting the cumulative @xmath30 variables of particle pairs .",
    "namely , for a given particle , instead of its @xmath36 one introduces the variable @xmath47 defined as @xcite    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the inclusive @xmath36 distribution , normalized to unity , which is obtained from all particles used in the analysis . by construction ,",
    "the @xmath47 variable varies between 0 and 1 with a _ flat _ probability distribution .",
    "the two - particle correlation plots , as presented in this paper , are obtained by plotting @xmath50 points for all possible particle pairs within the same event .",
    "the number of pairs in each @xmath50 bin is divided by the mean number of pairs in a bin ( averaged over all @xmath50 bins ) .",
    "this two - dimensional plot is uniform when no inter - particle correlations are present in the system .",
    "correlations due to the bose statistics produce a ridge along the diagonal of the @xmath50 plot , which starts at @xmath51 and ends at @xmath52 , whereas temperature fluctuations lead to a saddle shaped structure @xcite .",
    "as will be seen in the figures , the distribution of @xmath53 or @xmath54 obtained from the two - dimensional @xmath50 plots by projecting on the @xmath53 or @xmath54 axis is not flat .",
    "this is due to the method by which the plots are constructed .",
    "namely , each pair of particles is represented by a point on the plot .",
    "therefore , the events with higher multiplicities are represented by a larger number of pairs than those with smaller multiplicities .",
    "since the shape of the @xmath30 distribution depends on the event multiplicity , the projection of the two - dimensional plot on @xmath53 or @xmath54 is no longer flat .",
    "however , it should be stressed that in the absence of any correlations the @xmath50 plot is uniformly populated and the @xmath53 and @xmath54 projections are flat .",
    "the na49 experiment is a large acceptance hadron spectrometer at the cern - sps used to study the hadronic final states produced by collisions of various beam particles ( p , pb from the sps and c , si from the fragmentation of the primary pb beam ) with a variety of fixed targets . the main tracking devices are four large volume time projection chambers ( tpcs ) ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) which are capable of detecting 80% of approximately 1500 charged particles created in a central pb+pb collision at 158 @xmath0gev .",
    "two of them , the vertex tpcs ( vtpc-1 and vtpc-2 ) , are located in the magnetic field of two super - conducting dipole magnets ( 1.5 and 1.1 t , respectively ) and two others ( mtpc - l and mtpc - r ) are positioned downstream of the magnets symmetrically to the beam line .",
    "the results presented here are analyzed with a global tracking scheme @xcite , which combines track segments that belong to the same physical particle but were detected in different tpcs .",
    "the na49 tpcs allow precise measurements of particle momenta @xmath55 with a resolution of @xmath56 ( gev / c)@xmath57 .",
    "up is supplemented by two time of flight ( tof ) detector arrays and a set of calorimeters .",
    "the targets , c ( 561 mg / cm@xmath14 ) , si ( 1170 mg / cm@xmath14 ) and pb ( 224 mg / cm@xmath14 ) for ion collisions and a liquid hydrogen cylinder ( length 20 cm ) for elementary interactions , are positioned about 80 cm upstream from vtpc-1 .",
    "pb beam particles are identified by means of their charge as seen by a helium gas - cherenkov counter ( s2 ) and p beam particles by a 2 mm scintillator ( s2 ) .",
    "both of these are situated in front of the target .",
    "the study of c+c and si+si reactions is possible through the generation of a secondary fragmentation beam which is produced by a primary target ( 1 cm carbon ) in the extracted pb - beam . with the proper setting of",
    "the beam line magnets a large fraction of all @xmath59 fragments at @xmath60gev are transported to the na49 experiment . on - line selection based on a pulse height measurement in a scintillator beam counter ( s2 ) is used to select particles with @xmath61 ( carbon ) and @xmath62 ( al , si , p ) .",
    "in addition , a measurement of the energy loss in beam position detectors ( bpd-1/2/3 in fig . [ setup ] ) allows for a further selection in the off - line analysis .",
    "these detectors consist of pairs of proportional chambers and are placed along the beam line .",
    "they also provide a precise measurement of the transverse positions of the incoming beam particles .    for p ,",
    "c and si beams , interactions in the target are selected by an anti - coincidence of the incoming beam particle with a small scintillation counter ( s4 ) placed at the beam axis between the two vertex magnets . for p+p interactions at 158 @xmath0gev",
    "this counter selects a ( trigger ) cross section of 28.5 mb out of 31.6 mb of the total inelastic cross section . for pb beams ,",
    "an interaction trigger is provided by an anti - coincidence with a helium gas - cherenkov counter ( s3 ) directly behind the target .",
    "the s3 counter is used to select minimum bias collisions by requiring a reduction of the cherenkov signal by a factor of about 6 .",
    "since the cherenkov signal is proportional to @xmath63 , this requirement ensures that the pb projectile has interacted with a minimal constraint on the type of interaction .",
    "this setup limits the triggers on non - target interactions to rare beam - gas collisions , the fraction of which proved to be small after cuts , even in the case of peripheral pb+pb collisions .    the centrality of the nuclear collisions is selected by use of information from a downstream calorimeter ( vcal ) , which measures the energy of the projectile spectator nucleons",
    ". the geometrical acceptance of the vcal calorimeter is adjusted in order to cover the projectile spectator region by the setting of the collimator ( coll ) .",
    "details of the na49 detector set - up and performance of tracking software are described in @xcite .",
    "the data used for the analysis consists of samples of p+p , c+c , si+si and pb+pb collisions at 158 @xmath0gev . for pb+pb interactions",
    "a minimum bias trigger was used allowing a study of the centrality dependence .",
    "the distribution of energy measured in the vcal for the minimum bias pb+pb events was divided into six centrality bins ( table [ data_sets ] ) which are numbered from 1 ( the most central ) to 6 ( the most peripheral ) . for each bin of centrality the range of the impact parameter @xmath64 , and the mean number of wounded nucleons",
    "@xmath65 were determined by use of the glauber model and the venus event generator @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the total inelastic cross section of nucleus+nucleus collisions ( @xmath66 ) corresponding to each data set was calculated directly by use of the distribution of energy measured in the vcal . in order to estimate the correlation between the energy deposited in the vcal and the impact parameter minimum bias venus events",
    "were processed through the geant detector simulation code , and the energy deposited in the vcal was simulated . the correlation between @xmath64 and @xmath67",
    "was obtained from glauber model calculations using the spectator - participant model of a+a interactions .",
    "the values of @xmath66 , @xmath68 and @xmath64 presented in table [ data_sets ] are taken from @xcite for minimum bias pb+pb collisions and from @xcite for c+c and si+si interactions .",
    "the minimum bias pb+pb data consists of data taken during three different periods and at both magnetic field polarities .",
    "the most central pb+pb events correspond to 5@xmath69 of the total geometric cross section . since the minimum bias data provide only a small number of events in the most central pb+pb bin , additional central trigger runs were used .",
    "the aim of the event selection criteria is to reduce a possible contamination with non - target collisions .",
    "the primary vertex was reconstructed by fitting the intersection point of the measured particle trajectories .",

    "several track cuts are applied .",
    "the accepted particles are required to have measured points in at least one of the vertex tpcs .",
    "a cut on the so - called track impact parameter , the distance between the reconstructed main vertex and the track in the target plane , is applied ( @xmath74 cm and @xmath75 cm ) to reduce the contribution of non - vertex particles .",
    "moreover , particles are accepted only when the potential number of points ( calculated on the basis of the geometry of the track ) in the detector exceeded 30 .",

    "preliminary results for the rapidity range 2.9 - 4.0 were reported @xcite .",
    "however , the azimuthal acceptance in this region is more limited and systematic uncertainties affecting @xmath1 are not yet fully understood .",
    "the statistical error on @xmath1 was estimated as follows .",
    "the whole sample of events was divided into 30 subsamples .",
    "the value of @xmath1 was evaluated for each subsample and the dispersion ( @xmath83 ) of the results was then calculated .",
    "the statistical error of @xmath1 was taken to be equal to @xmath84 .",
    "the event and track selection criteria reduce the possible systematic bias of the measured @xmath1 values . in order to estimate the remaining systematic uncertainty ,",
    "the values of cut parameters have been varied within a reasonable range and the systematic error has been estimated as a half of the difference between the highest and the lowest @xmath1 value .",
    "in addition , results obtained from the analysis of data taken at two different magnetic field polarities as well as from different running periods have been compared .",

    "the majority of tracks selected by the track selection criteria are main vertex tracks and the remaining fraction ( @xmath8510% ) originates predominantly from weak decays and secondary interactions with the material of the detector . in order to estimate the influence of this contamination on the measured value of @xmath1 , the impact parameter cut was varied ( fig .",
    "[ fipt_bxby ] ) .",
    "a small increase of @xmath1 with increasing impact parameter cut is observed and may be due to the increased contribution of non - vertex tracks from weak decays and secondary interactions . by use of the venus @xcite simulations these tracks",
    "were found to be correlated in @xmath36 thus increasing the measured value of @xmath1 .",
    "the estimated systematic error due to the contamination of non - vertex tracks is smaller than 1.6 mev / c for central pb+pb collisions , 0.75 mev / c for si+si data and 0.35 mev / c for p+p events .",
    "losses of tracks due to the reconstruction inefficiency and track selection cuts influence the measured @xmath1 values . in order to estimate this effect , the dependence of @xmath1 on the percentage of randomly rejected particles was calculated .",

    "so , there is a natural suggestion that the @xmath30 fluctuations measured by @xmath1 may be caused by the collective flow .",
    "this suggestion was checked by performing a simple monte carlo analysis generating events with independent particles , following the measured inclusive @xmath30 distribution .",
    "the uniform azimuthal angle distribution of the events was modified by the collective elliptic flow but the particles remained independent from each other with respect to their transverse momenta . for such events the dynamical @xmath30 fluctuations vanish if the azimuthal angle acceptance is complete . however , the azimuthal angle acceptance of the na49 detector is not flat , and consequently the azimuthal anisotropy generates a finite value of @xmath1 , even though the @xmath30 of particles are independent of each other .",
    "it was found that an abnormally large value of @xmath99 leads to @xmath1 as large as 17 mev / c , but a realistic magnitude of @xmath100 , which depends on @xmath30 ( according to @xcite taken as @xmath101(gev / c ) ) , results in a value of @xmath1 which is consistent withzero ( @xmath102 mev / c ) .",

    "in contrast to the data , @xmath1 computed within the hijing model does not change when going from elementary to central pb+pb collisions because the hijing model represents an essentially independent superposition of n+n interactions .",
    "the effects of short range correlations ( bose - einstein and coulomb ) have not been incorporated in the hijing model .",
    "however it was estimated in the previous analysis @xcite that the combined effect of short range correlations produces @xmath1 values on the level of 5 mev / c for central pb+pb collisions .",
    "this effect strongly depends on multiplicity and becomes negligible for p+p interactions .    for the hijing model @xmath1 values for positively charged particles",
    "are , as in the case of real data , lower than for negatively charged and for all charged particles . the fact that @xmath1 values for positively charged particles are always lower than for negatively charged ones has been found ( using hijing ) to be related to the limited acceptance and treating protons as pions ( assuming the pion mass for all produced particles ) .",
    "when @xmath1 was first introduced @xcite it was believed that its value would be non - zero for elementary interactions ( mainly due to the @xmath90 versus @xmath32 dependence ) and would vanish for heavier colliding systems as a result of equilibration .",
    "the present measurements do not confirm this expectation . although @xmath1 is close to zero for central pb+pb collisions ,",
    "the maximum value is observed not for p+p data , but for colliding systems with @xmath103 40 .",
    "although the value of @xmath1 is small for p+p collisions , a significant structure appears in the two - particle correlation plot ( fig .",
    "[ 2d_plots_b ] ) .",
    "the first candidate for its origin is the dependence of @xmath90 on @xmath32 , observed for elementary interactions @xcite .",
    "[ pt_n ] compares @xmath104 versus @xmath32 for the hijing model and for real p+p data ( @xmath43 represents averaging over events with a given @xmath32 ) .",
    "the hijing model includes the na49 acceptance and all kinematic restrictions .",
    "it shows good agreement with the measurements .",
    "[ pp_2d ] presents the p+p two - particle correlation plots for data ( a ) , for the hijing model ( b ) and for a simple random generator , which reproduces the dependence of @xmath90 on @xmath32 observed in the data ( c ) .",
    "the accepted particle multiplicity distribution for the random generator ( c ) is the same as in the case of data ( all kinematic cuts and na49 geometric acceptance are included ) .",
    "both models ( b ) and ( c ) qualitatively reproduce the structure of the two - particle correlation plot observed in the data , however , the hijing model ( b ) shows additionally a small enhancement of the point density in the region of high @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath1 value calculated for model ( c ) for all charged particles equals 1.2 @xmath105 0.2 @xmath105 1.8 mev / c and is consistent with @xmath1 for the p+p data ( 2.2 @xmath105 0.3 @xmath105 1.2 mev / c ) .",
    "nevertheless the small difference might indicate that , in agreement with the analysis presented in @xcite , there could be an additional source of correlations present in the data .",
    "however , due to the relatively high statistical and systematic errors the effect can not be estimated quantitatively .",
    "a similar analysis was carried out for negatively charged particles only , where the correlations caused by resonances and by charge conservation are expected to be smaller than for all charged particles . there , the experimental value of @xmath106 is 0.8 @xmath105 0.1 @xmath105 1.2 mev / c while the model ( c ) gives 0.6 @xmath105 0.2 @xmath105 0.3 mev / c .",
    "two - particle correlation plots for negatively charged particles only are very similar for data and for model ( c ) .",
    "thus , one concludes that the results on negative particles from p+p interactions are consistent with the conjecture @xcite that the particles are emitted independently but that their @xmath107 and @xmath30 distributions depend on event multiplicity .    the last panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ pp_2d ] presents the result of a simple temperature fluctuation model ( the concept is described in @xcite ) , which assumes that the only source of fluctuations is event - by - event fluctuation of the inverse slope parameter ( @xmath108 ) of the transverse mass spectra . the model assumes a gaussian shaped rapidity distribution and an exponential shape of the transverse mass distribution with the mean inverse slope parameter @xmath109 = 152 mev adjusted to agree with the experimental p+p results .",
    "all kinematic cuts applied for the real data are also used in this model and the effect of the finite detector acceptance is taken into account .",
    "the mean multiplicity of all accepted particles is the same as in the data .",
    "the fluctuations of the inverse slope parameter lead to a saddle shaped structure in the two - particle correlation plots .",

    "[ cc_2d ] a ( the same as fig .",
    "[ pp_2d ] b ) presents p+p events simulated by the hijing model .",
    "the structure observed for p+p collisions vanishes for heavier systems due to the dilution effect from the higher number of uncorrelated particles ( resulting from different n+n interactions ) , whereas the @xmath1 measure is not affected by this dilution effect .    in order to see how dynamical fluctuations influence",
    "two - particle correlation plots for central pb+pb data the above model with fluctuations of the inverse slope parameter was used again .",
    "the mean inverse slope parameter @xmath109 was set to 190 mev and the mean multiplicity of all accepted particles to 200 in order to compare the results with central pb+pb collisions .",
    "the inverse slope parameter varied from event to event with a gaussian shaped distribution of width @xmath110 .",
    "[ toy ] presents @xmath50 plots for different levels of the inverse slope parameter fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuations lead to a saddle shaped structure which is not visible in central pb+pb collisions .",
    "one can thus exclude significant @xmath108 fluctuations in central pb+pb collisions at top sps energy . in fig .",
    "[ fipt_deltat ] the predicted dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath108 fluctuations @xcite is plotted and compared to @xmath1 measured for the 5% most central pb+pb interactions .",
    "the experimental @xmath1 value contains both short and long range correlations .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the @xmath108-fluctuation model presented in @xcite which does not include short range correlations .",
    "the dashed line is the combination of this model with a contribution of short range correlations estimated experimentally @xcite as 5 mev / c , in agreement with theoretical arguments @xcite .",
    "one sees that the observed value of @xmath1 is already below the contribution of the bose - einstein correlations and that the inclusion of slope fluctuations makes the difference even larger .",
    "thus , one can conclude , in agreement with the previous results @xcite , that the data leave no space for significant @xmath108 fluctuations provided they are not canceled by other negative correlations .",
    "an increase of transverse momentum fluctuations was predicted @xcite to occur in a+a collisions which freeze out near a second order critical end point of the qcd phase diagram . based on calculations from @xcite and the numbers given in table [ data ]",
    "it can be estimated that such critical fluctuations alone should result in @xmath111 mev / c .",
    "this number is significantly larger than the maximum value of @xmath1 found in this analysis - for peripheral pb+pb interactions ( @xmath112 mev / c ) .",
    "note , however , that in this theoretical estimate the effect of the limited experimental acceptance was not taken into account .",
    "transverse momentum fluctuations in a+a collisions and elementary interactions were measured by several experiments in the sps energy range .",
    "a value of @xmath113 mev / c for charged hadrons was reported by the na22 experiment in @xmath114 and @xmath115 interactions @xcite at 250 gev in a rapidity acceptance similar to the one used in this paper .",
    "the value obtained by the na22 experiment is higher than the result presented in this paper for p+p interactions at 158 @xmath0gev ( @xmath116 mev / c ) .",
    "this can be caused by the differences in azimuthal acceptance , energy and types of interacting hadrons .",
    "the ceres experiment at the sps measured @xmath117 mev / c for charged hadrons in central pb+au collisions at 158 @xmath0gev @xcite .",
    "this measurement was performed close to mid - rapidity ( pseudo - rapidity @xmath118 ) in the @xmath30 range @xmath119 gev / c and with full azimuthal angle acceptance .",
    "a somewhat smaller value , @xmath120 mev / c , is found in this paper for the similar pb+pb reaction at forward rapidities .",
    "significant non - statistical fluctuations ( @xmath121 mev / c ) were measured for charged hadrons at mid - rapidity in central au+au collisions at @xmath122 = 130 gev by the star experiment @xcite . at the rhic energies @xmath30 fluctuations",
    "are expected to be larger than at the sps due to a significant contribution of correlated particles originating from ( mini-)jet fragmentation .    a non - monotonic centrality dependence of @xmath30 fluctuations , with a maximum for semi - central au+au collisions ,",
    "was reported by the phenix experiment at @xmath122 = 200 gev @xcite .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with the result presented in this paper for pb+pb collisions at 158 @xmath0gev .",
    "a centrality dependence of @xmath30 fluctuations was observed also by the star experiment at @xmath122 = 130 gev @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that currently available event - by - event measurements were performed in a limited acceptance , the multiplicity of observed particles being below 20% of the total multiplicity .",
    "consequently , the sensitivity of these measurements , in particular to long range correlations is reduced .",
    "it is desirable to perform future event - by - event measurements in an extended acceptance .",
    "transverse momentum event - by - event fluctuations were studied for p+p , c+c , si+si and pb+pb collisions at 158 @xmath0gev .",
    "the analysis was limited to the forward rapidity region .",
    "three different characteristics were measured : the fluctuations of average transverse momentum ( @xmath90 ) of the event , the @xmath1 fluctuation measure , and transverse momentum two - particle correlations .",
    "all measured @xmath1 values are below 10 mev / c and are much smaller than the dispersion of the inclusive @xmath30 distribution .",
    "however , the correlations observed in p+p collisions are not simply more and more diluted when going to heavier colliding systems as could be expected if the created matter approaches a higher level of equilibrium with increasing system size . instead , a significant system size dependence of the @xmath1 measure is seen with a maximum for peripheral pb+pb collisions with @xmath103 40 .",
    "the two - particle correlation plot for p+p data shows a prominent structure which was found to be connected with the dependence of @xmath90 on @xmath32 .",
    "this structure disappears when going to heavier colliding systems .",
    "instead short range correlations become visible as an enhancement of the point density in the region close to the diagonal .",
    "this effect is strongest for the most central pb+pb interactions .",
    "no structure characteristic of event - by - event temperature fluctuations is observed .      in future",
    ", a study of the energy dependence of transverse momentum fluctuations in the cern sps energy range is planned using the na49 pb+pb collision data taken at different beam energies .",
