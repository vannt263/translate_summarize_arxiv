    "our knowledge of diagnostics for a bh or a ns presence in x - ray binaries has been challenged in the last years by growing observational evidence that the spectral index is uniquely sensitive to the type of the compact object ( ns or bh ) during burst events ( titarchuk & shaposhnikov , 2005 ; shaposhnikov & titarchuk 2009 ; shrader et al . 2010 ; farinelli & titarchuk , 2011 ; titarchuk et al .",
    "2014 , hereafter tss14 ) . * in other words ,",
    "this observational signature can be used as a probe for the nature of a compact star*. the photon index @xmath7 of the energy spectrum tends to be quasi - constant , around @xmath9 ( or the spectral index @xmath10 ) for a neutron star .",
    "when @xmath7 monotonically increases with an outburst flux and then saturates at the burst peak , this compact object is identified as a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "the observational behavior of the index in a ns is combined with the specific decrease of @xmath7 , from the level of @xmath11 to @xmath12 at the high plasma temperatures of the transition layer ( tl ) when @xmath13 kev [ see sst14 and @xcite , hereafter stss15 ] .",
    "this specific behavior of @xmath7 versus @xmath8 is never observed in bhs and thus can be considered as a spectral signature of a ns .",
    "the index correlations for bhs were demonstrated by @xcite , hereafter st09 .",
    "@xcite , hereafter st11 , discovered the photon index behavior versus mass accretion rate in nss , and then it was confirmed by tss14 . because the above ns diagnostic was only tested for low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) , now we decided to check this index versus mass accretion rate correlation also for high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to test this method , using this index versus mass accretion correlation , in application to hmxbs which are relatively young sources consisted of a massive early - type stellar companion ( ob / be - type star ) and a compact object ( ns or bh ) . in some",
    "be / x - ray binaries x - rays are produced when matter accretes to a compact object passing through the dense equatorial disk of be - star .",
    "other hmxbs contain a more massive ob supergiant , which is characterized by stellar winds with mass - loss rates of @xmath14 to @xmath15 m@xmath16 per year .",
    "a fraction of this outflow may be attracted by a compact object .",
    "usually , hmxbs with o - b stars produce periodic x - ray outbursts in a case of high eccentric binary orbits during periastron passages . for the circular orbit cases ,",
    "some of ob / x - ray binaries containing supergiants , demonstrate large sporadic x - ray flares .",
    "roche lobe overflow usually leads to an accretion disk and a wind .",
    "long - term observation revealed precession effects in v - optical light curve ( see khruzina & cherepashchyk , 1983 ) which can be interpreted as an indication of a disk component in accretion flow .",
    "these binaries usually host black holes [ e.g. , cyg  x-1 and a number of hmxbs in the magellanic clouds and the milky way , see a review by @xcite ] .",
    "hmxb 4u  1700 - 37 is an interesting example of such ob / x - ray binary .",
    "however , the nature of the compact object in this system is still an open question ( a ns or a bh ? ) in spite of the fact that observations of 4u  1700 - 37 have been obtained for more than 40 years .",
    "4u  1700 - 37 is a well studied accreting supergiant x - ray binary ( sgxb ) first detected by the _ uhuru _ satellite in 1970s ( see jones et al .",
    "a companion star is o6.5 iaf supergiant with a fairly well measured mass and radius ( abubekerov 2004 ; rubin et al .",
    "1996 ; heap & corcoran 1992 ) .",
    "4u  1700 - 37 displays regular eclipses every 3.41 days , which are firmly associated with the orbital period ( see table  [ tab : table_param ] for other binary parameters ) .",
    "this eclipse covers about 14% of the orbit ( i.e. 0.5 days ) , and residual emission is visible during this period probably because of scattering of x - rays in a wind from the supergiant star ( boroson et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the compact object associated with this system does not exhibit any pulsation , while boroson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported an information on quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "most of nss in x - ray binaries demonstrate coherent pulsations [ see e.g. @xcite that in 4u 1728 - 34 ] .",
    "thus , the origin of the compact object in 4u  1700 - 37 is not clear ( see gottwald et al . 1986 ; clark et al .",
    "2002 ) . in comparisons with other sgxbs , the 4u  1700 - 37",
    "source displays prominent x - ray long and short variabilities which are * very similar to those seen , for example , in vela x-1 [ see @xcite ] . * prominent x - ray flares in 4u  1700 - 37 are observed by integral for which flux increases up to two orders of magnitude ( by a factor of @xmath17100 ) , often reaching 1.5 crab , or more ( see kuulkers et al .",
    "this can be due to an increase of the rate of wind - fed accretion or due to magnetospheric storms . that behavior of 4u  1700 - 37 is similar to that seen in previous observations by cgro / batse , granat / sigma ( markert et al . 1979 ; pietsch et al . 1980 ; laurent et al .",

    "2004 ) .",
    "because of non - detection of pulsations and the observed x - ray hard tails , brown et al .",
    "( 1996 ) proposed that this source is a bh candidate .",
    "however , reynolds et al .",
    "1999 found that the 2  200 kev _",
    "beppo_sax spectrum of 4u  1700 - 37 was fitted by a high energy cutoff power - law model which is a typical spectrum of an accretion powered x - ray pulsars . moreover , using the _ beppo_sax spectrum , reynolds et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also declared a presence of cyclotron absorption feature at @xmath1737 kev .",
    "_ suzaku _ observations possibly revealed a pronounced cyclotron absorption feature at @xmath1739 kev and spectral variability on ks time scales , due to both variable absorption around the average value of @xmath18 @xmath19 and changes in the spectral slope ( jaisawal & naik , 2015 ) .",
    "these results argue against a possibility of a black hole in the 4u  1700 - 37 source .",
    "high resolution spectra of xmm-_newton _ and _ chandra _ observations were well fitted by a two component absorption model which was previously utilized for interpretation of the 1991 april @xmath20 observations ( see boroson et al .",
    "2003 and van der meer et al .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "observations during the intermittent flare state of 4u  1700 - 37 revealed fluorescence emission lines from neutral atoms and the recombination lines from h and he like species .",
    "the line strengths varied over the observations .",
    "boroson et al .",

    "( 2005 ) found many fluorescence emission lines as well as recombination lines in the xmm-_newton _ spectrum of 4u  1700 - 37 .",
    "an extended ionization region around the source was suggested because of presence of these recombination lines . using the _ chandra _ observations boroson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) also revealed a few of mhz qpos in the power density spectra of 4u 1700 - 37 .",
    "we found a large range in the mass evaluations of the compact object ( @xmath21 ) and secondary star ( @xmath22 ) in 4u  1700 - 37 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "recent mass estimates of @xmath23 ( clark et al .",
    "2002 ; rude et al .",
    "2010 ) are significantly above the usually accepted mass limit for neutron stars .",
    "it is worth noting that abubekerov ( 2004 ) analyzed radial - velocity curves of hydrogen balmer absorption lines for the 4u  1700 - 37 source using the 1973  1976 iue spectral data ( see hammerschlang - hensberge et al .",
    "they estimated @xmath21 ( i ) using the current paradigm about the gravitational acceleration of the optical component ( @xmath24 m@xmath16 ) , ( ii ) using a radius of the optical component ( @xmath25 m@xmath16 ) and ( iii ) based on the mass - luminosity relation ( @xmath26 m@xmath16 ) .",
    "the upper limit of these estimates is in agreement with the results of dolan ( 2011 ) in which @xmath27 m@xmath16 ( see also similar estimates by clark et al . , 2002 ; rude et al . , 2010 ) and",
    "thus these estimates are significantly above the usually accepted mass limit for the neutron star .",
    "the dynamical measurement of this compact object mass can be taken as a demonstration that the object is a bh .",
    "however , such a mass estimate is not a conclusive argument for the compact object nature .",
    "a real proof should be followed from an observational corrobaration of the absence or presence of any solid surface for a particular object .    in this paper",
    ", we use an essentially new method for diagnostic of the compact object origin in 4u  1700 - 37 applying an analysis of available _ rxte _ , _ beppo_sax and _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "the list of observations used for the data analysis is shown in  2 , while in  3 we describe a reader details of our spectral analysis .",

    "beppo_sax narrow field instruments ( nfis ) : the low energy concentrator spectrometer [ lecs ; @xcite ] , the medium energy concentrator spectrometer [ mecs ; @xcite ] and the phoswich detection system [ pds ; @xcite ] for the 0.3 @xmath28 4 kev , 1.8 @xmath28 10 kev and the 15@xmath28150 kev ranges respectively .",
    "the source spectra were extracted from the event data using a circular region centered on the source of radius 30 \" . while an annulus region within 30 \" and 180 \" radii was used to determine the background .",
    "we applied the saxdas data analysis package for data reprocessing .",
    "we carried out the spectral analysis in the energy band for which the response is well known . in a model fitting we treated a relative normalization of the nfis as a free parameter while the mecs normalization was frozen at a value of 1 .",
    "this method led to cross - normalization factors in the range , expected for each of these instruments .",
    "the spectra were rebinned according to instrument energy resolution to have significant statistics in each bin .",
    "thus , the lecs spectra were rebinned using an energy dependent binning factor ( see  3.1.6 of cookbook for the _ beppo_sax nfi spectral analysis ) and applying rebinning template files provided by grppha of xspec .",
    "the pds spectra were rebinned with a binning factor 2 , grouping two bins together ( resulting bin width is 1 kev ) . for the @xmath30sax",
    "analyzed spectra we applied a systematic error of 1% .",

    "the observations were implemented in `` xis nominal '' position using an effective exposure of @xmath17 82.1 ks and @xmath17 81.5 ks for hxd and xis , respectively .",
    "xis detectors worked in the `` burst '' clock mode with `` 1/4 window '' option providing time resolution of 1 s. for the _ suzaku _ observations we utilized publicly available data ( version 2.0.6.13 ) .",

    "we applied the unfiltered event files for each of the operational xis detectors ( xis0 , 1 and 3 ) using the latest heasoft software package ( version 6.13 ) and following the _ suzaku _ data reduction guide .",
    "we obtained cleaned event files by re - running the _ suzaku _ pipeline implementing the latest calibration database ( caldb ) available since 2013 , january 20 and also applying the associated screening criteria files .",
    "thus , we got the 4u  1700 - 37 spectra from the filtered xis event data taking a circular region , centered on the source , of radius 30 \" , and the corresponding background spectra from an annulus region with 30 \" and 180 \" radii . using the _ beppo_sax sample we considered the background region to be in the vicinity of the source extraction region .",
    "we extracted spectra and lightcurves from the cleaned event files using xselect , and we generated responses for each detector utilizing the xisresp script with a medium resolution . implementing reprocessed hxd / pin event file and xselect package of ftools we created hxd / pin spectra and light curve of 4u  1700 - 37 .",
    "applying tuned non x - ray background ( nxb ) event file we accumulated the hxd / pin background light curves and spectrum .",
    "we included a correction for cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) in the pin spectra as recommended by the instrument team . in these _ suzaku _ observations",
    "we have also found flare - type variability of a factor of 100 ( xis-0 ) on time scales from minute to hours .",
    "we assumed that * the above x - ray variability * versus orbital phase within these observations was caused by a clumping wind structure or local @xmath31 variations .",
    "note , that * this kind on inhomogeneity has already been observed in other sgxbs , like 4u 1538 - 52 and gx 301 - 2 [ see @xcite and @xcite , respectively]*.    thus , we did not relate these x - ray variations to mass accretion rate changes ( @xmath32 ) . a time averaged spectral analysis was implemented using the hxd / pin and xis-0 spectra .",
    "we carried out spectral fitting applying xspec v12.7.1 .",
    "the energy ranges around of 1.75 and 2.23 kev are not used for spectral fitting because of the known artificial structures in the xis spectra around the si and au edges .",

    "we want to emphasize that the two - comptb model is usually applied to ns spectra , because in nss , the two comptonized components are created in * the cc * for which the seed photons come from the ns surface and the accretion disk . on the other hand , in a bh the seed soft photons are only produced in the accretion disk which is located next to the relatively hot cc .",
    "our model for 4u  1700 - 37 describes a scenario in which an accretion disk is connected to the compact object ( ns ) through the compton cloud ( cc ) ( see a possible geometry figure in stss15 ) .",
    "note , x - ray flux is highly variable ( by factor @xmath17 100 ) , showing evidence for a clumpy stellar wind ( jaisawal & naik 2015 ) , which probably results in a varying accretion rate . in our picture , the emergent thermal comptonization spectrum is formed in the hot compton cloud ( cc ) , where soft photons of temperature @xmath56 from the neutron star and the accretion disk of temperature @xmath57 are up - scattered off the hot electrons giving rise to two components , comptb1 and comptb2 , respectively .",
    "some fraction of these seed soft photons can be also observed directly from by the earth , that explains why we add a soft blackbody of the temperature @xmath58 with normalization @xmath59 .",
    "note , the comptb model describes the resulting spectrum as a convolution of a seed blackbody of normalization @xmath60 and temperature @xmath61 with the comptonization green function .",
    "the spectral index of the emergent spectra of the comptonization component is determined by the energy release in the cc . as tss14",
    "demonstrate that if the gravitational energy release occurs throughout the cloud around a ns then the spectral index should be around 1 ( or the photon index @xmath7 is around 2 ) .",
    "however , if the release of the energy takes place only in outer portion of the cc then the spectral index @xmath62 is less than 1 ( or @xmath7 is less than 2 ) .",
    "the latter case is realized in the sources for which the local emergent luminosity exceeds the eddington limit and where the plasma temperature of the cc outer part is higher than 30 kev .",

    "we list all best - fit parameters in table  [ tab : fit_table_sax_suzaku ] .",
    "the most important issue is how the photon index behaves depending on the different model parameters .",
    "these dependences are crucial for understanding the compact object origin in 4u  1700 - 37 . in this respect , for the @xmath36 and _ beppo_sax data ( see table [ tab : fit_table_sax_suzaku ] ) we find that the spectral indices @xmath66 and @xmath67 are around 1.00@xmath450.02 and 0.34@xmath450.08 , respectively ( or @xmath87 and @xmath88 are 2.02@xmath450.02 and 1.34@xmath450.08 , respectively ) .",

    "moreover , from figure  [ 6_spectra_rxte ] we can establish how the spectral shape changes in the energies greater than 30 kev reflecting an effect of a sum of the two comptonized components for different states .",

    "observationally , the expansion of the tl is also confirmed by a decrease of the seed photon temperature @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the photon index @xmath47 demonstrates the stability at the sub - eddington luminosity and a decrease at the high plasma temperature state as was previously found in sco  x-1 ( tss14 ) and 4u1705 - 44 ( stss15 ) .",
    "note that only three sources , 4u  1705 - 44 , 4u  1700 - 37 and sco x-1 show a drop of the photon index ( see figure [ gam_te_7obj ] ) .",
    "however , this index effect in 4u  1700 - 37 begins at lower @xmath113 kev , than that in sco  x-1 ( @xmath114 kev ) and 4u  1705 - 44 ( @xmath115 kev ) .",
    "we should point out that in sco  x-1 the maximum of the plasma temperature , @xmath116 exceeds 100 kev while that for 4u  1700 - 37 and 4u  1705 - 44 are in the range @xmath117 kev ( see figure [ gam_te_7obj ] ) .",
    "the optical component in 4u  1700 - 37 is characterized by a strong wind as it is usually observed in o@xmath28supergiants . the wind velocity near inner lagrange point increases ( abubekerov , 2004 ) .",
    "sgxb 4u  1700 - 37 have also been proposed to undergo episodes of disk accretion due to the formation of short lived accretion disks ( see , e.g. , fryxell & taam 1988 ) . generally , the angular momentum of the fast wind launched from a supergiant star is too low to form a disk ( ducci et al .",
    "however , this is not true if the velocity of the wind is strongly reduced by the effect of ionization of the x - rays emitted from the ns ( in this case the line driven acceleration mechanism can be nearly turned off ) . as discussed recently by romano et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , in systems with an orbital period of a few days ( 5  10 days ) and a moderate eccentricity , a disk is likely to form when the velocity of the wind from the massive companion drops by a factor of @xmath17100 ( i.e. from thousands to tens of km / s ) .",
    "thus , when accretion switches from the wind to the disk mode , x - ray luminosity is expected to rise significantly ( @xmath118 erg / s ) , due to the enhanced disk mass accretion rate .",
    "a rapid spin up phase is also expected to take place due to the angular momentum of the disk material that acquired by the ns during the accretion process ( klochkov et al . 2011 and jenke et al . 2012 ) .",
    "variable inner absorption is an observational evidence in favor of accretion disk formation in 4u  1700 - 37 .",
    "in fact , the absorption amount should rises as the compact object appears behind the wind dense parts , close to eclipse ingress and egress .",
    "however , this absorption is asymmetric about orbital phase @xmath119 in this system ( branduardi , mason , & sanford 1978 ) .",
    "mason et al .",
    "1976 and haberl et al . 1989",
    "that a sharp increase in absorption at @xmath120 is related to a region of increased density .",
    "boroson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) detected a ",
    "soft excess  in the flux at @xmath121 0.7 .",
    "haberl , white , & kallman ( 1989 ) pointed out that this absorption excess at @xmath122 could be due to an accretion taking 8% of the gas flow that accretes through the disk .    using _",
    "beppo_sax , _ suzaku _ and _ rxte _ observations , we find two blackbody emission sources : the first one is probably associated with the disk and the second is presumably associated with the neutron star ( ns ) , for which soft photon temperatures are about 1 kev or less and 1.4 kev , respectively .",
    "we also established that some spectra * can be fitted with an additional blackbody ( with normalization @xmath123 and @xmath124 kev ) , while other spectra do not require this component .",
    "note , the absense of the bbody at 0.6 kev is generally related to the low / hard states of 4u  1700 - 37 , while its detection is strictly accompanied by flaring events .",
    "these episodes are marked by vertical strips in figure  [ lc_1999 ] to relate these episodes to transient accretion disk events*. one can also see that these flaring events are associated with drops of the index @xmath47 and surges of @xmath123 ( @xmath125 ) by factor 10 .",
    "therefore , we can relate these moments with transient accretion disk events .",
    "in fact , we have found six of these intervals , in which we suggest switches between the wind and disk accretion regimes .    in the case of very low @xmath123 at 0.6 kev we fix @xmath123 at 0.001@xmath126 , * in order to model and compare our results for all spectral states and use * the same model for all states .",
    "this procedure allows us to take into account a weak accretion disk .    in our case ,",
    "the extended power - law is a tail of the comptonization spectrum which is created in the outer hot part of the compton cloud and we have already demonstrated and explained this pl phenomenon for a number of ns sources ( see stss15 , tss14 for details ) .",
    "thus , our spectral model has a basic , physical meaning , because it relies on the comptonization of two sources of soft photons , * one coming from the ns and the other has the disk origin*. as for the bbody source , these soft photons come from outer part of the extended disk .",
    "* it is worth noting that we keep @xmath127 when @xmath128",
    "because an illumination factor f = a/(1+a ) is close to one in this case .",
    "we should also clarify a relation between the xspec comptt and comptb models because they are widely used for modeling x - ray data .",
    "the comptt model parameters are the optical depth , which value depends on an assumed geometry , and the plasma temperature @xmath129 .",
    "we prefer to be independ on any assumption of the plasma cloud ( tl ) geometry .",
    "thus , we use the comptb model where the main parameters are the spectral index @xmath62 and the plasma temperature @xmath129 .",
    "instead of using the optical depth and plasma temperature provided by the comptt one can simply apply the comptb model*.    our figure [ two_state_spectra ] presents the main result of the paper where we show that the photon index @xmath7 ( @xmath62 + 1 ) is around 2 while the cc plasma temperature is less than 30 kev .",
    "note , that the applied electron cross - section is thomson in this case .",
    "however , when the cc plasma temperature increases above 30 kev the electron cross - section drops and thus , the critical luminosity increases . in this case",
    ", @xmath130 kev , the emergent luminosity is less than the critical and thus , the radiation pressure originated at the ns surface can not stop the accretion flow .",
    "note , 4u 1700 - 37 hid is similar to those of lmxbs while the ccd is different .",
    "thus , we can conclude that 4u 1700 - 37 behaves in the same way as a ns in lmxb in terms of physical quantities ( the spectral index and the cc plasma temperature ) keeping , however in mind that ccd is only a qualitative description of the data .",
    "indeed , our figure [ ccd_hid_1700 ] presents clearly the spectral softening when the count rate increases .",
    "one possible issue for the presented study is that the magnetic field which can be as high as normal x - ray pulsar , see aforementioned claims using the data analysis of the appropriate _ beppo_sax observations [ reynolds et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and jaisawal & naik , 2015 ] .",
    "the absence of pulsations from this source even leads to a suggestion that the source could be a bh source .",
    "in fact , we have found using our analysis that the illumination factor of the compton cloud , @xmath131 is very close to 1 ( or @xmath132 ) in most of the observations .",
    "this means that the ns is embedded in a thick compton cloud that does not allow a direct view of the ns surface , making difficult to estimate the ns magnetic field .",
    "applying _ suzaku _ , _ beppo_sax , and _ rxte _ observations we studied the correlations of spectral properties , with mass accretion rate , @xmath32 observed in the non - pulsating high mass binary , 4u 1700 - 37 .",
    "we find that all broad - band energy spectra of this source can be adequately presented as a sum of two comptonization spectra associated with the seed photon temperatures , @xmath133 kev and @xmath134 kev .",
    "we also put an iron - line component to the model . * our model of the 4u  1700 - 37",
    "spectra allows us to separate the contributions of two specific spectra , related to the hard and soft x - ray components along the ccd and hid presumably dictated by @xmath32 .",
    "the observed luminosity determined by two normalizations @xmath77 and @xmath78 of the comptonized components which are proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "we also found that the soft comptonization component ( associated with the ns seed photons ) dominates over the hard comptonization component ( associated with the disk seed photons ) .",
    "this effect is clearly visible in the second panel from the bottom in figure  [ lc_1999]*.    during x - ray flares , in a surge of @xmath32 , we observe an increase of @xmath78 correlated with a rise of the plasma temperature @xmath135 ( see 2nd and 3rd panels from the bottom of figure [ lc_1999 ] ) .",
    "our spectral analysis of 4u 1700 - 37 also discovers the stability of photon indices @xmath44 and @xmath47 around 2 during the states which relate to the cc plasma temperature range of @xmath5 from 2 kev to 30 kev , while a drop of @xmath47 is seen during a rise of @xmath136 40 kev ( see figure [ two_state_spectra ] ) .",
    "we interpret the quasi - stability of @xmath7 around 2 in the framework of a model in which the gravitational energy release occurs in the transition layer ( tl ) and this energy deposition in the tl greatly exceeds that in the disk .",
    "the similar effect was previously revealed in lmxbs : atolls , 4u  1705 - 44 , 4u  1728 - 34 , gx  3 + 1 , 4u  1820 - 30 and z - sources , sco  x-1 , gx  340 + 0 ( see figure [ gam_te_7obj ] ) .",
    "in addition to the index plateau phase of @xmath137 we also reveal the index decrease for the hard comptonization component detected over the flaring branch ( fb ) , in addition to the index plateau stage of @xmath138 .",
    "note , that a similar phase is observed in 4u  1705 - 44 over the upper banana branch and in sco  x-1 at the fb which is an additional argument for the ns presense in 4u 1700 - 37 .",
    "we can interpret this index decrease using the model in which the gravitational energy release occurs only in an outer part of the compton cloud ( cc ) ( see details in tss14 ) .",
