    "<S> we consider guarding classes of simple polygons using mobile guards ( polygon edges and diagonals ) under the constraint that no two guards may see each other . </S>",

    "<S> some _ guard set ? </S>",
    "<S> types include simple polygons and the subclasses of orthogonal , monotone , and starshaped polygons . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , guards may either exclude or include the endpoints ( so - called _ open _ and _ closed _ guards ) . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a nearly complete set of answers to existence questions of open and closed edge , diagonal , and mobile guards in simple , orthogonal , monotone , and starshaped polygons , with some surprising results . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , every monotone or starshaped polygon can be guarded using hidden open mobile ( edge or diagonal ) guards , but not necessarily with hidden open edge or hidden open diagonal guards . </S>"
