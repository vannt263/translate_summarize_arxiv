    "this happens since a large decay width for @xmath9 corresponds to large values of @xmath10 or @xmath12 which also imply large widths for the competing modes @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",

    "the systematic uncertainty due to the selection procedure was estimated by varying the most important selection criteria and was found to be less than 1% .",
    "in particular , the effect of the limited knowledge of the energy scale of the electromagnetic calorimeter has a small impact in the limits .",
    "the combined effect of the systematic uncertainties is included in the limits shown in figure  [ fig : ac_limits ] .",
    "it degrades the limits by at most 4% , slightly depending on the coupling and the higgs mass hypothesis .",
    "we verified that possible effects of angular dependence of the efficiency on the value of the anomalous couplings is negligible for the @xmath2 process .",
    "no such effects are expected for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 processes .      assuming the absence of large anomalous @xmath136 and @xmath137 couplings , _",
    "@xmath138  @xcite , the @xmath131 and @xmath139 couplings are parametrized via the following subset of effective operators : @xmath140    where the dependence of @xmath141 and @xmath142 on the @xmath10 and @xmath11 couplings is given by equations  [ eq : gg ] and  [ eq : zg ] .",
