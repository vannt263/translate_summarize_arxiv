    "as the downscaling of conventional cmos technology is bound to reach its fundamental limit new algorithms will be the answer to achieve increasingly higher performance and reduced power consumption .",
    "reconfigurable digital circuits provide a way to extend the functionalities of conventional cmos by implementing in the same physical space multiple logic operations and therefore increasing the computational complexity .",
    "reconfiguration of the logic functions at each individual device promises even more compact and flexible circuit design  @xcite .",
    "however , the implementation of such reconfigurable logic using single - electron transistors ( sets )  @xcite is appealing because sets have good scalability , one of the lowest energy - per - switching - event  @xcite and the possibility to combine their electrical properties with magnetic elements  @xcite .",
    "there have been several proposals to implement programmable set logic by using the charge degree of freedom such as fixed gate voltages @xcite , non - volatile charge nodes @xcite and the spin degree of freedom @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    ", we show a proof of principle for reconfigurable boolean logic based on magnetically - gated circuit elements and we suggest multi - device reconfigurable logic architectures .",
    "more particularly , we report the complementary logic operation of a aluminium mset .",
    "the reconfigurable capability of our mset stems from the magnetization - dependent work function of gamnas back gate .",
    "when the back - gate is kept at a constant potential the magnetic - field - induced chemical change causes a charge accumulation in the gate electrode which can be readily sensed by the set as a change in the coulomb oscillation phase  @xcite .",
    "although the concept is demonstrated here for mset devices , the operating principle is general and transferable to any field - effect transistor .",
    "the mset has two modes of operation : it responds to gate voltage inputs ( electric mode ) as well as to the orientation of the magnetic moments ( magnetic mode ) . by reorienting the magnetization of the gamnas substrate we are able to switch from n - type to p - type mset . making use of the magnetic mode we demonstrate two sets of reprogrammable boolean logic gates implemented at the single device level .",
    "finally , we suggest a strategy to scale the reconfigurable logic operation to the multiple device level .    a schematic cross - section of the proposed aluminium mset is depicted in fig .",
    "the key element of this structure is the magnetic gate electrode , an epitaxially grown ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as layer on gaas that acts as a back - gate with easy - axis directions [ 110 ] and [ 1 - 10 ] . a magnetic field @xmath2=0.7  t , larger that the saturation field b@xmath30.3  t , is applied to rotate the magnetization @xmath4 with respect to the [ 001 ] direction ( @xmath5=0@xmath6 ) .",
    "the angle @xmath7 with respect to the [ 1 - 10 ] direction is kept equal to 90@xmath6 in all measurements .",
    "the results presented here are independent of the magnitude of @xmath2 for @xmath8 .",
    "a 100  nm alumina layer is used as gate dielectric on top of which the al - set is fabricated .",
    "the source and drain leads are separated from the micron - sized island by aluminium oxide tunnel junctions , as it can be observed in the sem image in fig .",

    "the side gates were not used but could provide extra - functionality to the structure .",

    "side gates were not used in this experiment .",
    "( c ) drain current ( @xmath9 ) oscillations as a function of the back gate voltage ( @xmath10 ) . ]    in the electric mode of operation we use the back - gate voltage to control the induced - charge in the island of the mset .",
    "1(c ) shows the drain current ( @xmath9 ) versus back - gate voltage ( @xmath10 ) at 300  mk .",
    "the plot shows a periodic oscillatory behaviour of the current , namely the coulomb blockade oscillations .",
    "several devices were studied with typical charging energies @xmath11=100 - 300  @xmath12ev and gate capacitances @xmath13=0.4 - 1.0  ff .",
    "we obtain a i@xmath14/i@xmath15 contrast ratio of up to 1.33 and typical tunnel junction resistances of @xmath16=500  k@xmath17 .",
    "the magnetic mode of operation is based on the dependence of the gamnas band structure on the orientation of the magnetization due to spin orbit coupling .",
    "the magnetization reorientation yields a shift in the gamnas work function @xmath18 which in itself does not produce a response on the mset .",
    "however , when the back gate is held at constant potential a change in @xmath12 causes an inward or outward flow of charge in the gate which in turn offsets the coulomb oscillations .",
    "if the work function shift in the magnetic layer is adequate , the phase shift becomes half a period of the coulomb blockade oscillations and complementary msets are obtained . the equation that defines the necessary work function shift for maximum on - off current ratio",
    "can be expressed as ,    @xmath19    as well , the minimum potential shift for complementary operation at temperature @xmath20 can be defined as a gate voltage shift equal to the fwhm of the coulomb peak @xcite ,    @xmath21    these two equations set the operational parameters in terms of temperature , magnetic field and physical dimensions of the structure .    the complementary operation of the mset is experimentally demonstrated in fig",

    "we rotate continuously a saturating magnetic field from @xmath5=90@xmath6 , where the magnetization resides @xmath4 parallel to the plane along the easy - axis [ 110 ] ( fig.2(a ) ) to @xmath5=0@xmath6 where the magnetization is out - of - plane ( fig .",
    "this can be seen in fig.2(c ) where we plot the source - drain current @xmath9 as a function of the magnetization angle @xmath5 and gate voltage @xmath10 for @xmath24=15@xmath12v and b=0.7  t. when the magnetization is in - plane , we select @xmath10=-61  @xmath12v as the logic 0 and @xmath10=+86  @xmath12v as the logic 1 for the n - type set ( see fig .",
    "2(d ) ) . as the magnetic field",
    "is rotated to @xmath5=0@xmath6 , the magnetization is re - oriented in the [ 001 ] direction and the gamnas work function increases producing a gate voltage shift of @xmath25=150  @xmath12v  @xcite . the combination of work function potential shift in the ga@xmath0mn@xmath1as layer with the 300  @xmath12v gate voltage period of the device result in that the magnetically - induced gate voltage shift coincides with half a coulomb oscillation ( fulfilling eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "the mset behaves effectively as a p - type set , fig .",
    "therefore we can arbitrarily select the function of the set from an n - set for in - plane magnetization @xmath5=90@xmath6 to a p - type for out - of - plane magnetization @xmath5=0@xmath6 .",
