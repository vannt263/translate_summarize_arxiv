    "the signature of a @xmath11-dimensional fractional brownian motion is a sequence of iterated stratonovich integrals along the paths of the fractional brownian motion ; it is an object taking values in the tensor algebra over @xmath12 .",

    "chen in 1950 s in a series of papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in the last twenty years",
    "the attention devoted to signatures has increased rapidly .",
    "this has been caused by the pivotal role they have in rough path theory , a field developed in the late nineties by terry lyons culminating in the paper @xcite , which is also at the base of newly developed theory of regularity structures @xcite .",
    "the signature of a path summarises the essential properties of that path allowing the possibility to study spdes driven by that path .",
    "+   + in 2015 hao ni and weijun xu @xcite computed the sharp rate of convergence for expected brownian signatures .",
    "they obtained a rate of convergence of @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the size of the mesh of the dyadic approximation .",
    "+ however , for fractional brownian motion no progress has been made in this direction . in particular ,",
    "the rate of convergence for the expected signature of the fractional brownian motion is not known for any value of the hurst parameter @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "this article address this problem , obtaining the rate of convergence for @xmath0 $ ] . in order to obtain it we used the results of baudoin and coutin @xcite .",
    "indeed , in 2007 baudoin and coutin computed the expected signature for fractional brownian motion for @xmath10 and also for small times for @xmath14 .",
    "further works that analyse the properties of the signature of the fbm are @xcite and @xcite among others .",
    "+ in this work we focus on the weak rate of convergence and we refer to the work of friz and riedel @xcite for the strong rate of convergence .",
    "they obtained a rate of @xmath15 , while here we obtain a weak convergence rate of @xmath1 . +   + moving away from the dyadic approximation and focusing just on the expected signature , we recall the work of chevyrev and lyons @xcite . in @xcite they showed that the expected signature has infinite radius of convergence , but not a factorial decay . in this work",
    "we show that the expected signature has a factorial decay , indeed the bound for the @xmath4-th term of the signature is simply given by @xmath8 for all @xmath16 .",
    "the sharp decay rate is expected to be @xmath17 , but it remains an open problem . in the @xmath18 case , our result gives an alternative proof , with sharper estimates , that the expected signature of fractional brownian motion has infinite radius of convergence , which by @xcite implies that the expected signature determines the signature in distribution .",
    "our estimate is also sharper than the one obtained by friz and riedel @xcite , who proved a factorial decay of @xmath9 . +   + in 2003 lyons and victoir @xcite developed a numerical methods for solving parabolic pdes and general sdes driven by brownian motions called cubature method on weiner space . in the cubature method the first step is to obtain the cubature formula in which the truncated signature of a path ( in the case of @xcite is the brownian motion ) is matched to a finite sum of dirac delta measures applied to the iterated integrals of deterministic paths . in this work",

    "therefore we can rewrite the formula above as @xmath230 where @xmath231 this concludes the proof of the rate of convergence .",

    "hence as @xmath129 the difference between the exact value and the dyadic approximation goes to zero discontinuously ( or better continuously but with jumps / discontinuous point , i.e. stepwise ) .",
    "this makes the problem of the sharpness of the rate of convergence to appear impossible .",
    "a possible solution is to consider the iterated integral as a whole without focusing on the general double integral .",
    "but this seems a difficult way of dealing with the problem .",
    "indeed , we proceeded on with this way at the beginning of this work but the result was a bound with a rate of convergence of @xmath1 but with a non integrable coefficient . for these reasons",
    "we are confident that the rate of convergence of @xmath1 is sharp . + a final remark regards the fact that @xmath233 , which means that the difference goes to zero faster for the fbm than the bm .",
    "this is an expected result since the fbm with @xmath10 is a smoother path than the bm .",
    "this higher smoothness is related to the positive correlation of the increments of the fbm with @xmath10 .",

    "this is fundamental since the cubature method can be a cumbersome method in some cases .",

    "in this chapter we obtain the cubature formula for the one dimensional fractional brownian motion up to degree 5 . + as discussed before ( see section [ preliminaries ] and in particular definition [ cubature - definition ] ) , in order to obtain the cubature formula what we need to do is to find @xmath256 paths and @xmath256 weights such that @xmath55=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\lambda_{j}\\int_{0<t_{1}<, ... ,<t_{k } < t}d\\hat{\\omega}_{j , t_{1}}^{i_{1}}\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot d\\hat{\\omega}_{j , t_{1}}^{i_{k}}.\\ ] ] in our case , since we focus on the one dimensional case , @xmath257 for @xmath109 . for @xmath258 we mean that @xmath259 and @xmath260 are both the path @xmath261 ( i.e. @xmath262 ) . on the other hand , for @xmath263",

    "further , again in the appendix @xmath268 we provide their values and the corresponding equations for the deterministic paths @xmath266 .",
    "+ in this chapter we should prove theorem [ pr4 ] . however , due to the fact that the proof is mainly based on linear algebra computations , we decided to put the proof of this theorem in the appendix ( see appendix @xmath269 ) .",
    "+   + now , we need to discuss some important remarks about this result .",
    "given the definition of @xmath116 ( see remark [ rem ] ) we have that the cubature formula obtained in theorem [ pr4 ] is valid for the following degree @xmath270 the reason why we have different degrees for different values of @xmath16 is because we wanted to have the same cubature formula for different values of @xmath16 . in particular , we wanted a cubature formula which was the same obtained by lyons and victoir in @xcite for the brownian motion of degree 5 . in order to have it we needed to consider the same iterated integrals they considered .",
    "+ in other words , we decided to fix the number of iterated integrals and so to fix the system of 17 equations we needed to solve in order to have a cubature formula that was exactly as the one of @xcite for @xmath3 .",
    "this had as a counterpart the fact that for high value of @xmath16 the degree have to be decreased according to the definition of @xmath116 ( see remark [ rem ] ) . + further , in case we wanted to have a cubature formula for degree 5 ( independently of @xmath16 ) then we would had to compute more iterated integrals than the ones we computed .",
    "in this way we would add more constraints ending up with a cubature formula different from the one of @xcite .",
    "+   + given that the concept of _ degree _ for a general stochastic process is not usually known , we introduce now a more general concept which is related to the degree and can be adapted to any stochastic process : the concept of _",
    "order_.    let @xmath271 be a stochastic process .",
    "we say that a set of words @xmath70 is of order @xmath272 with respect to the stochastic process w if for any @xmath273 , where @xmath274 is any smooth vector field , we have @xmath275 @xmath276 , for @xmath277 small , and @xmath278 smooth and bounded . where c is a constant .",
    "further , we introduce the concept of _ cubature formula of order l_.    a cubature formula of order l is obtained by matching @xmath279 @xmath280 , for @xmath70 a set of words of order l with respect to the process w. where @xmath281 are positive weights and @xmath282 are continuous and deterministic paths .    using these definitions",
    "we can state that the cubature formula that we have obtained in theorem [ pr4 ] is of order @xmath283 .",
    "this is because the lowest order is obtained for @xmath3 , which is the brownian motion case for which we have an order of @xmath283 . indeed , for the fractional brownian motion we can make the following remark .    for the fractional",
    "brownian motion , and so also for the brownian motion , the relation between the order and the degree of a cubature formula is given by @xmath284 where h is the hurst parameter .",
    "hence , precisely the order of the cubature formula of theorem [ pr4 ] is @xmath285 we conclude with a final remark on the solution(s ) obtained for the cubature formula .    from the proof of this theorem ( see appendix 2 ) we obtain two solutions of our system of equations .",
    "in particular , we have only used one solution of the equation @xmath286 the other solution is given by @xmath287 the reason why we focused on the other solution and not this one is because lyons and victoir focused on that solution in their paper .",
    "they used mathematica to produce a solution , without explicitly justify their decision .",
    "however , both solutions are feasible for our system of equations @xmath288 . hence , we have two valid solutions for the cubature formula of the fractional brownian motion for this kind of structure ( i.e. piecewise linear paths with change of slopes at @xmath289 and @xmath290 ) .",

    "<S> the last result concerns the cubature formula for the one dimensional fbm for @xmath10 up to degree 5 . </S>",
    "<S> this result extends the work of lyons and victoir @xcite who focused on the multidimensional brownian motion cubature formula . </S>",
    "<S> +   + * key words : * fractional brownian motion , signature , rate of convergence , cubature method . </S>"
