    "experimental results for antiproton annihilation cross sections at very low energies ( @xmath10 mev / c ) , below the @xmath11 charge - exchange threshold , have recently been reported for light nuclei @xcite . at these energies",
    "the total @xmath1 reaction cross section consists only of @xmath1 annihilation .",
    "bianconi et al .",
    "@xcite reported the first ever measurements of @xmath1 annihilation on ne in the momentum range of 53 - 63 mev / c . comparing with other data",
    ", they showed that whereas at relatively higher energies ( @xmath12 mev / c ) ratios of @xmath1 annihilation cross sections on different nuclei exhibit the well - known @xmath13 strong - absorption dependence , such ratios at very low energies defy any simple , obvious regularity .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the _ ` expected ' _",
    "@xmath14 dependence of these cross sections on the atomic charge @xmath2 and mass number @xmath3 is badly violated @xcite .",
    "antiproton annihilation cross sections at very low energies simply do not rise with @xmath3 as fast as is anticipated .",
    "for example , over the whole mass range studied so far ( h , d , @xmath15he , ne ) , the ne / h ratio of total annihilation cross sections is at least 6 times smaller than expected .    in the present letter",
    "we study low - energy @xmath1 annihilation on nuclei , using the optical model approach .",
    "optical potentials have been very successful in describing strong - interaction effects in hadronic atoms @xcite , including @xmath1 atoms @xcite .",
    "it has been noted , for pions , that the total reaction cross sections at low energies are directly related to the atomic - state widths , and that once a suitable optical potential is constructed by reasonably fitting it to the atomic level shifts and widths in the negative energy bound - state domain , these total reaction cross sections are reliably calculable @xcite .",
    "the recent publications @xcite of experimental results of total cross sections for @xmath1 annihilation on nuclei at very low energies raise the intriguing possibility of connecting these two energy regimes in a systematic way also for antiprotons .",
    "however , most of the data on annihilation cross sections for @xmath1 are for very light nuclei , where the concept of a rather universal optical potential that depends on @xmath3 and @xmath2 only through the nuclear densities is questionable . for this reason we use optical potentials , in the present work , mostly for crossing the @xmath16 borderline within the _ same _ atomic mass @xmath17 range , from bound states to scattering .",
    "this optical model approach is different from the allegedly model - independent scattering length approximation @xcite which we have found to be less useful .",
    "we defer a discussion of the latter statement to a separate publication .    among the targets used in the @xmath1 annihilation measurements @xcite , the only ` real ' nuclei are @xmath18he and ne , in the sense that the conventional optical model is not expected to be applied to the lighter targets of hydrogen or deuterium . in the present work",
    "we show that the very low - energy @xmath1 total annihilation cross sections on @xmath18he @xcite and on ne @xcite are reproduced well by reasonable optical potentials fitted separately to the @xmath1 atomic data at the relevant atomic mass range .",
    "these potentials are strongly absorptive , which leads to a remarkable saturation of the total reaction cross section with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "strong absorption has very recently been shown @xcite to lead also to saturation of the widths of @xmath1 atomic states and to the prediction of relatively narrow deeply bound @xmath1 atomic states . in view of the close analogy between bound - state widths and total reaction cross sections ( see eqs .",
    "( [ equ : gamma],[equ : sigma ] ) below ) , it should come as no surprise that the underlying physics is the same .",
    "in fact , several @xmath1d calculations @xcite have found that the @xmath1 absorptivity in deuterium , as suggested by the magnitude of the imaginary part of the @xmath1d @xmath19-wave scattering length , is weaker than in hydrogen due partly to the repulsive effect of absorption .",
    "lastly , we use @xmath1 optical potentials fitted to a comprehensive set of atomic data across the periodic table to predict @xmath1 total annihilation cross sections at very low energies for a wide range of @xmath3 values , with the exception of very light targets .",
    "we show such calculated cross sections at @xmath8 mev / c and discuss their @xmath3 and @xmath2 dependence , particularly with respect to the @xmath14 dependence arising from coulomb focussing in the limit of very low energies .",
    "we also demonstrate the extent to which this dependence is violated at 57 mev / c .",
    "in the present work we aim at connecting @xmath1 atoms , at energies slightly below threshold , with @xmath1 annihilation on nuclei at very low energies above threshold , using an optical potential @xmath20 .",
    "assuming for simplicity a schrdinger - type equation , the width @xmath21 of an atomic level is given ( non - perturbatively ) by :    @xmath22    here @xmath23 is the @xmath1 full atomic wavefunction .",
    "the corresponding expression for the total reaction cross section at positive energies is    @xmath24    here @xmath25 is the @xmath1 - nucleus elastic scattering wavefunction and @xmath26 is the c.m . velocity .",
    "there exist several optical model potentials @xcite parameterized in terms of nuclear densities which are quite successful in reproducing the strong interaction effects in not too light nuclei , e.g. fitting all data for nuclei heavier than carbon . however , most of the good quality data on @xmath1 annihilation at very low energies are for very light nuclei where a straightforward application of the potential deduced from heavier targets is not expected to yield good fits",
    ". we have therefore started the present analysis by studying @xmath1 atoms of @xmath27he .",
    "the @xmath1 nucleus optical potential used here is given by the ` @xmath28 ' expression @xcite    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the nucleon mass , @xmath31 is the reduced @xmath1-nucleus mass , @xmath32 is a complex parameter obtained from fits to the data and @xmath33 is the nuclear density distribution normalized to @xmath3 .",
    "trying to fit level shift and width data in @xmath27he @xcite for the 2@xmath34 and 3@xmath35 states simultaneously , we always ended up with the calculated width of the 2@xmath34 state in @xmath18he being too small , thus contributing an unacceptably large value to the total @xmath36 of the fits .",
    "handling each isotope separately did not change this situation and we then decided to fit only the data for the 2@xmath34 states for the two isotopes .",
    "this is somewhat unfortunate as one expects to be able to use @xmath37-independent potentials , as is indeed the case with heavier targets @xcite .",
    "however , since our main concern here was to use atomic potentials at ( very low ) positive energies where @xmath35 and higher partial waves contribute very little in light nuclei , we considered this procedure acceptable .",
    "note that we are using the same potential for all the partial waves in the positive energy regime .",
    "very good fits to the data with reasonable values for the complex parameter @xmath32 could be obtained only when a ` finite range ' was introduced in the form of a gaussian folding of a @xmath38 interaction into the nuclear density distributions .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of heavier targets where such a procedure was not necessary .",
    "nevertheless , we consider the resulting potential , with @xmath32=0.49+@xmath393.0 fm and a gaussian with a range parameter of 1.4 fm folded into the nuclear density distribution ( hereafter referred to as potential ( a ) ) , as quite reasonable .",
    "it fits within the errors the measured strong interaction shifts and widths of the 2@xmath34 state in antiprotonic @xmath40he and @xmath18he .",
    "turning to positive energies , we first calculate the total reaction ( annihilation ) cross section for 57 mev / c @xmath1 on @xmath18he , in order to make it possible to compare results for he and ne @xcite . using the above potential ( a )",
    ", the calculated cross section is 901 mb , in excellent agreement with the interpolated value of 915@xmath4139 mb @xcite . for incident momenta of 47.0 and 70.4",
    "mev / c we calculate values of 1060 and 771 mb , respectively , where the experimental values @xcite are 979@xmath41145 and 827@xmath4138 mb , respectively .",
    "reasonably good agreement is therefore established between experiment and predictions made with a potential derived from fits to @xmath1 atoms of @xmath27he .",
    "figure [ fig : sat ] demonstrates the extreme strong - absorption conditions which are relevant to the @xmath1 nucleus interaction at very low energies ( and for @xmath1 atoms ) .",
    "it shows calculated reaction cross sections for @xmath1 at 57 mev / c on @xmath18he and ne as function of the strength i m @xmath32 of the imaginary part of the potential ( a ) described above , with the rightmost edge corresponding to its nominal value i m @xmath32=3.0 fm . it is seen that as long as the absorptivity ( i m @xmath32 ) is very weak , less than 1% of its nominal value , @xmath42 is approximately linear in i m @xmath32 , which according to eq .",
    "( [ equ : sigma ] ) means that the @xmath1 wavefunction depends weakly on i m @xmath32 .",
    "however , already at below 5% of the nominal value of i m @xmath32 the reaction cross sections begin to saturate , much the same as for the widths of deeply bound @xmath1 atomic states @xcite .",
    "the mechanism is the same in both cases , namely exclusion of the wavefunction from the nucleus due to the absorption , which reduces dramatically the overlap with the imaginary potential and consequently reduces the integrals in eqs . ( [ equ : gamma],[equ : sigma ] ) . the onset of saturation is determined approximately by the strength parameter 2@xmath31(im @xmath20)@xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the radius of the nucleus .",
    "thus , saturation of @xmath42 in ne starts at a smaller absorptivity than its onset in @xmath18he .",
    "the ne/@xmath18he ratio of @xmath42 values changes , due to this effect , from about 15 in the perturbative regime of very weak absorptivity to about 3 in the strong - absorption regime .",
    "however , the precise , detailed pattern of the change also depends on the real part of the optical potential which may increase or reduce the exclusion of the @xmath1 wavefunction from the nucleus .",
    "figure [ fig : res ] shows calculated @xmath1 reaction cross sections at 57 mev / c across the periodic table .",
    "the dot - dashed line is for the above mentioned potential ( a ) which is expected to be valid only in the immediate vicinity of he .",
    "the dashed line ( b ) is for the first potential from table 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite which fits @xmath1 atom data over the whole periodic table , starting with carbon .",
    "this potential is not expected to fit data for very light nuclei , and indeed it does not fit the @xmath18he annihilation cross section .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that for @xmath45 20 the two potentials predict almost the same cross sections and certainly display a very smooth and similar dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "a smooth @xmath3 dependence of the calculated cross sections is generally expected once several partial waves contribute , as we elaborate below .",
    "also shown in the figure is the recent experimental result @xcite for ne , with very limited accuracy . furthermore ,",
    "for @xmath45 20 the points along the solid line are the calculated @xmath46 - nucleus total reaction cross sections , obtained from potential ( b ) by switching off the coulomb interaction .",
    "the solid line is a fit to an @xmath47 power law which appears to be appropriate to strong absorption of uncharged particles at these very low energies , in contrast to the prediction of approximate @xmath3 independence made in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath46 annihilation at ultra low energies where _ only _",
    "@xmath19 waves contribute .",
    "we checked that by reducing the absorptivity by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude , a proportionality of @xmath42 to @xmath3 as expected for weak absorption , is indeed observed . comparing the dashed line for negatively charged particles with the solid line for uncharged particles , it is clear that the @xmath42 values obtained by including the coulomb interaction are considerably enhanced with respect to the ones obtained without it . attempting to fit the enhancement by a @xmath48 power law , we find that @xmath49 varies roughly between 1/3 for ne to 1/2 for pb",
    ". attempts to identify more precisely this enhancement across the periodic table have been recently addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss the @xmath14 scaling considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and in references quoted therein .",
    "we note that an attractive coulomb potential causes focussing of partial - wave trajectories onto the nucleus , an effect which at very low energies may be evaluated semiclassically ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the applicability of the semiclassical approximation to coulomb scattering ) .",
    "the maximal orbital angular momentum @xmath50 , for which the @xmath1-nucleus distance of closest approach is smaller than the nuclear radius @xmath44 , at sufficiently low energy is given by    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the c.m .",
    "momentum and    @xmath53    is the corresponding coulomb parameter .",
    "here @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the @xmath1 laboratory momentum , and @xmath56 is the bohr radius of the @xmath57 atom . since 2@xmath58 at very low energies and for high values of @xmath2 , the value of @xmath50 greatly exceeds the value @xmath59 which is appropriate to uncharged particles ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "for example , on pb at @xmath8 mev / c , @xmath50 is about 6 for @xmath1 , but is less than 2 for @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , for strong absorption , where all the lower partial waves are totally absorbed , one obtains    @xmath61    which we rewrite as    @xmath62    with @xmath63 defined by @xmath64 .",
    "a similar approach was used by fldt and pilkuhn @xcite to calculate coulomb corrections to @xmath65-nucleus total cross sections near the 3,3 resonance . in the present case of very low energies",
    "their correction becomes the dominant term , and the resulting reaction cross section on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ equ : semi ] ) is substantially higher than the black - disk value @xmath66 which for uncharged projectiles may be perceived as the unitarity limit of @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , the calculated saturation plateau values of @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sat ] are several times larger than the appropriate black - disk values .    in figure",
    "[ fig : scale ] we plot , for potential ( b ) , ratios of calculated total reaction cross sections at 57 mev / c to the scaling parameter @xmath68 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath42 does not scale with @xmath69 across the periodic table .",
    "also plotted is the asymptotic value    @xmath70    with @xmath71 fm and @xmath72 fm . for a given @xmath1 beam energy this asymptotic value , arising from coulomb focussing ,",
    "is approached very slowly upon increasing @xmath2 .    before concluding we briefly mention other derivations of the @xmath14 dependence of @xmath42 .",
    "the proportionality to @xmath2 is usually derived from the well - known coulomb enhancement gamow factor which at low energies is well approximated by @xmath73 @xcite . however , at these very low energies , the coulomb wavefunctions are far from being constant over the nuclear volume , so that the applicability of the gamow factor appears questionable .",
    "the origin of a possible proportionality of @xmath42 to @xmath47 is even less clear : for @xmath19-wave dominated @xmath1 annihilation , as considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is due to the imaginary part of the @xmath1 scattering length which is assumed to closely follow the nuclear radius @xmath44 .",
    "however , for @xmath1 strongly absorptive potentials this imaginary part has invariably been found to be about 1 fm across the periodic table @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , considerably less than @xmath44 .",
    "it is inconceivable that a proportionality to @xmath44 can arise unless several partial waves contribute significantly .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the recently reported annihilation cross sections for @xmath1 on @xmath18he and ne at 57 mev / c are reproduced very well by optical potentials which fit @xmath1 atomic data in the respective mass ranges ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] ) . for these strongly absorptive potentials ,",
    "the asymptotic @xmath14 dependence of the total reaction cross section was derived from the coulomb focussing effect at very low energies , but at 57 mev / c it was found not to be satisfied across the periodic table except for unrealistically high values of @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scale ] ) .",
    "the correct dependence is determined by the saturation property of total reaction cross sections at very low energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sat ] ) .",
    "the apparent suppression of @xmath1 total annihilation cross sections measured at @xmath10 mev / c is a direct consequence of the strong absorption , and in particular its saturation property .",
    "predictions have been given for @xmath1 total annihilation cross sections at 57 mev / c across the periodic table which would complement and enrich the information deduced from the measurements already available for @xmath1 atoms .",
    "a more extended discussion of optical model calculations and their implications for @xmath1 atoms and @xmath1 annihilation on nuclei , including a connection to @xmath74 annihilation at @xmath75 mev / c , is included in a forthcoming publication @xcite ."
