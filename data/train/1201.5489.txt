    "@xcite in the high - redshift supernova search team and by perlmutter et al .",
    "@xcite in the supernova cosmology project team independently reported that the present observable universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion phase . the exotic source for this cosmic acceleration",
    "is generally dubbed `` dark energy '' ( de ) . despite many years of research ( see e.g. , the reviews @xcite ) its origin has not been identified till yet . de is distinguished from ordinary matter ( such as baryons and radiation ) , in the sense that it has negative pressure .",
    "this negative pressure leads to the accelerated expansion of the universe by counteracting the gravitational force .",
    "the astrophysical observations show that about 73% of the present energy of the universe is contained in de .",
    "there are several de models to explain cosmic acceleration .",
    "one of interesting de candidates is the chaplygin gas which was proposed to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "the chaplygin gas behaves as a pressureless dark matter ( dm ) at early times and like a cosmological constant at late stage @xcite .",
    "this interesting feature leads to the chaplygin gas model being proposed as a candidate for the unified dm - de ( udme ) scenario @xcite .",
    "more recently , a new de model called ghost de ( gde ) has been motivated from the veneziano ghost of choromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the advantages of the gde with respect to other de models include the absence of the fine tuning and cosmic coincidence problems and the fact that it can be completely explained within the standard model and general relativity , without recourse to any new field , new degree(s ) of freedom , new symmetries or modifications of general relativity @xcite .",
    "several aspects of this new paradigm , in particular observational constraints on this model , have been investigated in the literature @xcite .",
    "the other interesting issue in modern cosmology is reconstructing the scalar field models of de which has been investigated in the literature @xcite .",
    "the scalar field models ( such as quintessence , phantom , quintom , tachyon , k - essence , dilaton and chaplygin ) are often regarded as an effective description of an underlying theory of de @xcite .",
    "the scalar field models can alleviate the fine tuning and coincidence problems @xcite .",
    "scalar fields naturally arise in particle physics including supersymmetric field theories and string / m theory .",
    "therefore , scalar field is expected to reveal the dynamical mechanism and the nature of de . however , although fundamental theories such as string / m theory do provide a number of possible candidates for scalar fields , they do not uniquely predict its potential @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "therefore it becomes meaningful to reconstruct @xmath0 from some de models ( such as holographic , agegraphic and ghost ) .",
    "all mentioned in above motivate us to investigate the correspondence between the gde and the chaplygin scalar field model of de .",
    "to do so in section 2 , we study the interacting gde with dm in a spatially non - flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe . in section 3 , we investigate the chaplygin scalar filed model of de . in section 4 , we suggest a correspondence between the interacting gde and the chaplygin scalar field model of de .",
    "we reconstruct the potential and the dynamics for the ghost chaplygin scalar field model .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the gde density is given by @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a constant with dimension @xmath3 ^ 3 $ ] , and roughly of order of @xmath4 where @xmath5 mev is qcd mass scale . with @xmath6 ev , @xmath7 gives the right order of observed de density .",
    "this numerical coincidence is impressive and also means that this model gets rid of fine tuning problem @xcite .    here",
    ", we investigate the gde model in the framework of einstein gravity . to do so , we consider a spatially non - flat frw universe containing the gde and dm .",
    "the first friedmann equation in the standard frw cosmology is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the reduced planck mass and @xmath10 is the hubble parameter . here ,",
    "@xmath11 represent a flat , closed and open frw universe , respectively .",
    "also @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the energy densities of dm and gde , respectively .",
    "using the usual definitions for the dimensionless energy densities as @xmath14 the friedmann equation ( [ 1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath15 substituting eq .",
    "( [ rhogde ] ) into @xmath16 yields @xmath17 using the above relation , the curvature energy density parameter can be obtained as @xmath18 where we take @xmath19 for the present value of the scale factor .",
    "we further assume there is an interaction between gde and dm .",
    "the recent observational evidence provided by the galaxy cluster abell a586 supports the interaction between de and dm @xcite . in the presence of interaction ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 do not conserve separately and the energy conservation equations for gde and pressureless dm are @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the equation of state ( eos ) parameter of the interacting gde and @xmath25 stands for the interaction term .",
    "following @xcite , we shall assume @xmath26 with the coupling constant @xmath27 .",
    "this expression for the interaction term was first introduced in the study of the suitable coupling between a quintessence scalar field and a pressureless dm field @xcite .",
