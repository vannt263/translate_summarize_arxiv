    "this impression is confirmed by the application of a bidimensional ks test ( press et al . 1992 ) . the probability for the circles ( empty @xmath1 filled ) and the arrows being derived from the same parent distribution is @xmath2 0.2 per cent .",

    ". arrows with crosses refer to the upper limits on @xmath3ray poor x  ray transients detected by ( their inclusion / exclusion from the sample does not alter any of the presented result ) .",

    "yet , it is possible that foas are optically fainter because intrinsically less energetics at all wavelengths , or because they are more distant . in order to check this ,",
    "we compared the x  ray and @xmath0 band flux densities of bursts with and without optical detection 12  hours after the burst event , finding that the x  ray fluxes of foas are not systematically fainter than the fluxes of afterglows with optical detection , indicating that foas are indeed optically poor and define a different population with respect to optically detected afterglows .",
    "we have checked that local galactic extinction does not play a crucial role by comparing the hydrogen column densities in the direction of detected afterglows with those in the direction of foas .",
    "we have investigated the possibility that the difference between the two groups is due to absorption local to the burst .",
    "we can quantify in roughly 2 magnitudes the amount of average absorption in the @xmath0 band needed for more than half of the bursts to go undetected in the optical .",
    "can a typical molecular cloud produce such an absorption in more than half of the bursts ? in order to answer this question",
    "we ( lazzati et al . 2001 ) have computed the _ average _ ( i.e. over many line of sights ) and the _ maximum _ absorption of known molecular clouds in our galaxy , taking into account that observations of bursts in the @xmath0 band actually correspond to light emitted at shorter wavelengths , where extinction is more effective . since the redshifts of foas is obviously unknown , we have assumed @xmath7 for all of them .      * if the burst is located at random within a molecular cloud , it will on average be absorbed with the mean value of the cloud absorption . in this case",
    "we found that only a few percent of the burst afterglows could be missed for this reason . *",
    "if bursts are located in star forming regions , then they lie in the densest parts of the cloud , i.e. those with maximum absorption . in this case",
    "it is ( albeit marginally ) possible that up to 60 per cent of the bursts have optical afterglows sufficiently absorbed to have avoided detection . but consider that we have been very conservative in our procedure , because our results are based on considering _",
    "upper limits _ on the optical flux , and _ peak _ absorption columns expected in giant molecular clouds . *",
    "the latter assumptions may well be too conservative , if the dust is bound to evaporate when illuminated and heated by the powerful optical / uv flash of the gamma ",
    "ray burst ( waxman & draine 2000 ) and by its x  ray radiation ( fruchter et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this dust sublimation is suggested for a sample of burst afterglows ( vreeswijk et al .",
    "1999 , galama & wijers 2000 ) , in which a very large hydrogen column density @xmath8 @xmath9 , as estimated by x  ray data , is associated with almost no optical extinction .",
    "the results can be understood only in terms of a dust to gas ratio @xmath10 times smaller than the galactic average value . in turns , such low values of the dust to gas",
    "ratio can be explained only if the dust has been completely sublimated in the surroundings of the burst .",
    "indeed the theoretical models mentioned above predict that dust can be destroyed by the burst emission out to a radius comparable to the dimension of a typical molecular cloud ( up to a few tens of parsecs ) . if this is the case , the material responsible for absorption in foas is not the overdense cocoon surrounding the star forming region , but the cloud as a whole ( or even less ) , and the discrepancy between the observed and measured value becomes extremely compelling .",
