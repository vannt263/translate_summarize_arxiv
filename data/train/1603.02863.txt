    "paper addresses the problem of communication over the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel with lattice codes .",
    "the first notable work on the possibility of sending information with lattices over the awgn channel with satisfactory performance is due to de buda and dates back to 1975 @xcite .",
    "he showed how lattice codes whose shaping region is a ball can be reliably decoded at any asymptotic rate up to @xmath0 under _ lattice decoding_. this decoding strategy does not take into account the shaping region that defines the constellation .",
    "in other words , a lattice decoder simply returns the lattice point closest to the decoder input , regardless of whether it belongs to the constellation or not . as a consequence ,",
    "the decoding decision regions are all equivalent and coincide with the voronoi regions of the lattice points .",
    "of course , this method is suboptimal with respect to the maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoder .",
    "nevertheless , its easier algorithmic nature makes it appealing for both theoretical analysis and practical implementation .    the work by de buda continued @xcite and was partially corrected by linder , schlegel and zeger @xcite .",
    "they were able to prove that lattice codes can attain the capacity of the awgn channel under optimal decoding , with shaping determined by `` thin '' spherical shells .",
    "this peculiar shaping region actually makes the code lose most of its lattice structure and look similar to a random code on a sphere .",
    "urbanke and rimoldi @xcite completed this work with the proof that lattice codes made up of the intersection between a ball and a lattice are capacity - achieving under optimal nearest - codeword decoding .",
    "thus , it was shown that lattice codes are capacity - achieving .",
    "nonetheless , the question of whether this result can be obtained under ( _ a priori _ non - optimal ) lattice decoding remained answerless . in 1997 , loeliger @xcite proved the achievability of the rate @xmath0 with construction - a lattices over non - binary alphabets and conjectured that this limit could not be overcome with lattice decoding .",
    "it has been necessary to wait for erez and zamir s solution to the problem @xcite , based on the modulo - lattice additive noise ( mlan ) channel and voronoi constellations with construction - a lattices .",
    "more recently , belfiore and ling @xcite proposed a solution that involves an infinite ( but energetically finite ) codebook .",
    "once the theoretical problem of non - constructively achieving capacity with ml decoding was solved , it left the place also to the challenge of designing some constructive families of lattices adapted to iterative decoding with close - to - capacity performance .",
    "the intention was , and still is , to translate into concrete evidence the theoretical effort of showing that lattices are adequately suited to block coding in high dimensions for the awgn channel .",
    "most of the proposed families are inspired by ldpc and turbo codes @xcite and an interesting work on lattices based on polar codes exists @xcite ; the latter are also shown to be capacity - achieving .    the authors of this paper have contributed to this field with the introduction of two lattice families : the most recent are the _ generalized low - density ( gld ) lattices _ @xcite .",
    "they show great performance under iterative decoding and numerical simulations have been run in remarkably high dimensions ( up to one million ) .",
    "moreover , a theoretical analysis about the possibility of achieving the so called poltyrev capacity with infinite gld - lattice constellations is provided in  @xcite .",
    "the second family consists of _ low - density construction - a ( lda ) lattices _ , to which this paper is entirely devoted .",
    "lda lattices put together the strength of construction a @xcite and ldpc codes ( over a non - binary prime field ) @xcite .",
    "their main feature is that their corresponding parity - check matrix is sparse .",
    "as one can guess , this is the key idea to redirect their decoding to well - performing , implementable ldpc decoding algorithms .",
    "lda lattices were first envisaged in @xcite and were referred to with this name and reintroduced by di pietro _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , together with an efficient iterative algorithm to decode them .",
    "a theoretical analysis of the poltyrev - capacity - achieving qualities of infinite lda constellations was carried out by the same authors @xcite , whereas the `` goodness '' properties of lda lattices are studied in @xcite .",
    "the problem of attaining the real capacity of the awgn channel with finite lda constellations was addressed and a solution was developed in the first author s dissertation @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to give a detailed account of this solution : improvements will also be provided along the way .",
    "defoliated of all technical hypotheses , our main accomplishment can be stated as follows :    [ thm : light_version ] for every @xmath1 , there exists a random ensemble of lda lattices that achieves capacity of the awgn channel under lattice encoding and decoding .",
    "one may question the point of proving this kind of result for lattices that are designed for iterative decoding in high dimensions , knowing well that it will be impractical to implement a lattice decoder .",
    "historically , lattice decoding has been considered conceptually simpler than ml decoding for constellations of points in @xmath2 with little structure , and therefore as a possible intermediate step towards polynomial - time and more practical decoding algorithms . for us , knowing that the lda family has the potential to reach capacity justifies and encourages further research into the design and study of practical iterative techniques for this family of lattices or some of its subfamilies .",
    "the more precise version of theorem [ thm : light_version ] is theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity_lda ] of section [ sec : main_theorem ] and all the other results of this dissertation are intermediate steps to reach its proof .",
    "the most relevant of these is theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity ] of section [ sec : capacity_with_random_construction_a ] , which is the analogue of theorem [ thm : light_version ] or [ thm : awgn_capacity_lda ] for more general , non - lda construction - a finite lattice constellations .",
    "the capacity of the awgn channel was previously shown to be achievable by lattice decoding of lattice code ensembles by erez and zamir @xcite , ordentlich and erez @xcite , ling and belfiore @xcite , and recently for polar decoding by yan _ et al . _",
    "the additional insight provided by our proof techniques includes the following :    * we are able to prove the capacity - achieving properties of construction - a lattices without using the theoretical tool of the mlan channel @xcite ; in particular , we do not assume that the sender and the receiver share the common randomness known as _ dither _ , even if we apply minimum mean square error ( mmse ) estimation of the channel output .",
    "this solves a problem raised by forney @xcite who points out that in this context avoiding the use of a dither has to be possible , but no proof had ever been provided , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "* we still rely on voronoi lattice constellations and do not need to introduce gaussian coding @xcite . *",
    "we follow the work of @xcite and @xcite in that we use construction a together with randomly chosen @xmath3-ary codes . as before , @xmath3 has to be a growing function of the lattice dimension @xmath4 : however , we are able to reduce its growth rate . *",
    "last , but not least , this proof technique adapts to the case of lda lattices , whereas how to adapt previous proofs to the lda case is to us very much unclear .    among the main aspects that characterise our work , it is important to remark that the row and column hamming weights of the parity - check matrices of the non - binary ldpc codes that underlie our construction are reasonably small constants and do not need to tend to infinity with the lattice dimension .",
    "this is an appreciable feature , because the complexity of the lda decoding algorithm is directly proportional to those numbers .",
    "the minimum value of the constant row weight as a function of the parameters of the construction is explicitly given in theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity_lda ] ( compare also with @xcite ) .",
    "notice that for binary ldpc codes to achieve the capacity of any memoryless binary symmetric channel or of the binary erasure channel , asymptotically infinite row weights are mandatorily required @xcite .",
    "some graph - based , capacity - achieving binary codes with bounded decoding complexity in spite of their unbounded maximum row weight are instead pfister _",
    "s ira codes @xcite .",
    "our lda ensemble is based on random bipartite graphs .",
    "these graphs are known to have some particular _ expansion properties _ that , qualitatively speaking , say that all `` small enough '' sets of nodes have `` large enough '' neighborhoods .",
    "we exploit intensively these properties , formally made explicit in lemma [ lem : good_graphs ] and corollary [ cor : good_graphs ] of section [ sec : graph_theoretical_tools ] ; they turn out to be two of the most important theoretical pillars of our analysis .",
    "lemma [ lem : min_h_dist ] and corollary [ cor : fundamental_gain_lda ] of section [ sec : random_lda_ensemble ] consist of a lower - bound of the minimum euclidean distance and fundamental gain of our lda ensemble and are an example of how expansion properties are used in our setting .    as a final comment , notice that our capacity - achieving result for lda lattices does not hold for @xmath5 .",
    "nevertheless , this is not a very constraining restriction : for very small @xmath6 there is no need for using lattice constellations for communications over the awgn channel and classical coded binary modulations are already known to work in a more than satisfactory way @xcite .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : section [ sec : lattices ] contains a list of definitions about lattices and lattice constellations . in section [ sec : lemmas ] , we state four useful lemmas , which will be often employed in the following .",
    "section [ sec : capacity_for_random_construction_a ] recalls the main features of theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity ] , which shows how and under what conditions random construction - a lattice constellations achieve the capacity of the awgn channel .",
    "section [ sec : the_random_ensemble ] and section [ sec : encoding_and_decoding ] provide a formal definition of those constellations and of the information transmission scheme that we consider . in section [ sec : main_ideas ]",
    ", we give a general description of the main ideas that lead to the proof of theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity ] and theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity_lda ] .",
    "the complete detailed proof of theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity ] is provided in section [ sec : detailed_proof ] .",
    "section [ sec : graph_theoretical_tools ] is an independent section which presents the expansion properties of bipartite graphs .",
    "section [ sec : capacity_for_lda ] is an introduction to the lda setting , to which the second part of the paper is entirely devoted .",
    "our random lda - lattice constellations are presented in section [ sec : random_lda_ensemble ] , which contains also a result on the minimum distance of their underlying ldpc codes and hermite constants .",
    "the detailed proof of theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity_lda ] on the capacity - achieving properties of lda lattices is provided in section [ sec : lda_capacity_detailed_proof ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] recalls the main results of this paper and contains some concluding remarks .",
    "finally , the appendices contain the proofs of most of the lemmas which are not treated in detail in the other sections .      throughout the whole paper we will very often use asymptotic relations between functions of the lattice dimension @xmath4 .",
    "as usual , the symbol @xmath7 indicates the `` asymptotic equality '' : @xmath8 if @xmath9 .",
    "the notation @xmath10 indicates that @xmath11 for some @xmath12 ; or , equivalently , that @xmath13 , for some @xmath14 . with analogous meaning , we can write @xmath15 . the symbols @xmath16 and @xmath17 refer to the standard bachmann - landau notation in the variable @xmath4 .",

    "observe that @xmath21 is subexponential for every @xmath22 .",
    "we will very often deal with balls and spheres and we will denote @xmath23 the @xmath4-dimensional ball centered at @xmath24 with radius @xmath25 .",
    "a crucial parameter of our analysis is the prime number @xmath3 that underlies construction a ( cf .",
    "definition [ def : constructiona ] ) .",
    "it needs to tend to infinity when the lattice dimension @xmath4 grows and we are interested in describing the growth of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath4 . for this reason",
    ", @xmath3 is defined as @xmath26 for some positive constant @xmath27 .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath4 changes and @xmath27 is fixed , then in general @xmath28 is not a prime number",
    ". it would be more precise to say that @xmath29 is the closest prime number to @xmath28 , or that @xmath30 for some @xmath31 assuming values in an interval properly centered at our fixed value @xmath27 .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to show that this variation of @xmath31 concerns a range which is narrow enough not to impact any of the asymptotic estimations that we compute letting @xmath4 tend to infinity . in other words",
    ", there always exists a prime number @xmath3 close enough to @xmath28 to make accurate the approximation @xmath26 ( for example , we can apply bertrand s postulate @xcite ) . despite the slight abuse of notation",
    ", we prefer to keep it that way from now on , in order to write the proofs in the clearest way possible and avoid the overabundance of symbols .",
    "we assume that the reader is already familiar with lattices as mathematical objects and constellations for the transmission of information ; excellent references are @xcite .",
    "we recall here some definitions that we will need in the following , mainly with the purpose of fixing our notation .",

    "the first main result of this paper is theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity ] of section [ sec : capacity_with_random_construction_a ] , which consists of a new proof that there exists a random ensemble of construction - a lattices that achieves capacity under mmse lattice decoding when @xmath1 .",
    "our work preserves the main advantages of the already known results on construction - a lattices , while overcoming some of their less attractive aspects .",
    "the main features of our proof are :    * our family is similar to the one proposed by ordentlich and erez @xcite , but our approach is dual with respect to theirs : our construction - a ensemble is defined via a set of parity - check matrices ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : the_random_ensemble ] ) , whereas they employ generator matrices .",
    "* we still adopt the technique of voronoi constellations for shaping .",
    "* we do not need dithering anymore .",
    "this meets the purpose of ling and belfiore @xcite of avoiding the unpractical sharing of common randomness between the sender and the receiver .",
    "however , they pay the price of a non - constructive encoder .",
    "our proof instead does not need lattice gaussian distribution and we still have an _ a priori _ uniform distribution over the lattice constellation .",
    "moreover , an explicit bijection exists that maps messages to constellation points ( cf . ) .",
    "this is desirable when we think of practical implementations of our encoding and decoding scheme .",
    "our transmission scheme is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : enc_dec_scheme ] and treated in detail in section [ sec : encoding_and_decoding ] . *",
    "we still rely on the idea of scaling the awgn channel output by the wiener coefficient , before performing lattice decoding .",

    "* we restrict our construction to the case @xmath1 .",
    "the reasons of this choice will be explained in section [ sec : geometric_description ] . * with respect to ordentlich and erez s construction",
    ", we decrease the size of the prime number needed for construction a as a function of @xmath4 , still attaining capacity ( recall that they have @xmath91 ) . again",
    ", this has practical advantages .",
    "most of the previously listed features will concern theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity_lda ] , too .",
    "sections from [ sec : capacity_for_random_construction_a ] to [ sec : graph_theoretical_tools ] , although they are self - contained and relevant on their own , can be also considered as an essential and detailed introduction to the proof of theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity_lda ] , which restricts the random construction - a ensemble to a low - density construction - a ( lda ) ensemble .",
    "presenting first theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity ] allows the reader to understand the strategy and the tools required to show how capacity is achieved independently from the problems that arise from other less general constructions .",
    "consequently , when moving to the proof of theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity_lda ] , we will be able to focus more on those technicalities that strictly belong to the low - density structure associated with lda lattices .",
    "our random construction - a ensemble is simply given by a random parity - check matrix , whose entries are independent random variables uniformly distributed over @xmath92 . in particular ,",
    "let @xmath52 be this matrix , of dimension @xmath93 for some @xmath94 and let @xmath95 be its lower submatrix formed by the last @xmath96 rows of @xmath52 for some @xmath97 : @xmath98 the submatrix @xmath95 defines a linear code @xmath99 over @xmath100 and the whole matrix @xmath52 defines a subcode @xmath48 of @xmath99 .",
    "the two lattices @xmath36 and @xmath41 , obtained with construction a respectively from @xmath48 and @xmath99 are nested : @xmath101 the voronoi constellation that we consider is then given by @xmath102 ( see definition [ def : voronoi_constellation ] ) . if we suppose that all the rows of @xmath52 are linearly independent , then @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the real rates of the codes @xmath48 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "it is known that @xmath105 from which we deduce that the cardinality @xmath106 of the lattice constellation is @xmath107 notice that the probability that the rank of @xmath52 is strictly smaller than @xmath108 can be shown to decrease to @xmath70 very fast when @xmath4 tends to infinity ; hence we will work as if @xmath52 always had full rank .",
    "the points of the constellation ( or equivalently the cosets of @xmath45 ) are indexed by the @xmath109 different syndromes of the form @xmath110 associated with the matrix @xmath52 , where all the @xmath111 .",
    "more explicitly , let @xmath112 and let @xmath113 be ( in @xmath114-@xmath114 correspondence with ) the set of the messages ; the bijection @xmath115 makes a constructive encoding possible ( recall that @xmath116 is the upper submatrix of @xmath52 ) .",
    "our transmission scheme works as follows :    1 .",
    "the sender pairs up a message and a syndrome and transmits @xmath60 , the corresponding constellation point obtained via @xmath117 , over the awgn channel .",
    "2 .   the receiver gets the channel output @xmath61 and multiplies it by the wiener coefficient @xmath73 .",
    "3 .   then , he performs lattice decoding of @xmath118 and gets @xmath119 .",
    "4 .   the decoded message will be the one associated with @xmath120 .    a final remark on the bijection @xmath121 : for every @xmath122 , let @xmath123 be any solution of the linear system @xmath124 .",
    "then @xmath125 and the encoding operation can be substantially performed thanks to a lattice decoder , too .",
    "we will now give a general description of our proof , by the means of a heuristic argument that does not take into account all the probabilistic and asymptotic aspects of the rigorous demonstration .",
    "our result is based on the following facts :    * the points of the constellation typically have the same norm and lie very close to the surface of a sphere of a given radius ( cf .",
    "lemma [ lem : typical_norm ] ) . *",
    "the awg noise is typically almost orthogonal to the sent vector , in the sense that , if @xmath60 is our transmitted constellation point and @xmath126 is the noise , then the scalar product @xmath127 has a `` small enough '' absolute value ( cf .",
    "lemma [ lem : orthogonal_noise ] ) . * the effective noise due to mmse",
    "scaling and the sent point are not decorrelated .",
    "consequently , it is not possible to show that mmse lattice decoding works with very high probability independently of the sent point .",
    "nevertheless , theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity ] is based on the fact that the number of points for which this does not happen is not big enough to perturb the average error probability of the family . * for a certain mmse - scaled channel output , we look for lattice points inside a sphere centered at it and with a typical radius to be specified later .",
    "basically , there will be no decoding error if the only lattice point in this _ decoding sphere _ is the transmitted one .",
    "in a few particular cases , we will need to show explicitly that even if there is more than one lattice point in the decoding sphere , the decoder output will still be the channel input .",
    "consider that when we use the adverb `` typically '' , we mean `` with probability tending to @xmath114 when @xmath4 tends to infinity '' .",
    "the accurate proof will be treated in all detail in the sequel , but let us try to understand the geometric sense of the elements that we have just listed .",
    "so , suppose that the channel input is a point @xmath60 whose norm is fixed to be @xmath128 , for some @xmath129 , which will turn out to be the average ( and asymptotically maximum ) power of the constellation .",
    "suppose also that @xmath130 ( this is a stronger hypothesis than the statement of lemma [ lem : orthogonal_noise ] , but it helps to understand the more general scenario ) ; if @xmath61 is the channel output , then @xmath131 .",
    "now , let us multiply @xmath71 by the scalar value @xmath73 that minimizes the distance between @xmath60 and @xmath118 . if @xmath77 is the awg noise variance per dimension , basic euclidean geometry ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : geometric_interpretation ] ) tells us that if @xmath132 , then @xmath133 is precisely the wiener coefficient .",
    "this lets us guess that mmse scaling helps in bringing the decoder input closer to the sent point .",

    "we intuitively understand that this is the good condition on the maximum bearable noise , admitting that no problem comes from the fact that the `` effective '' noise and the sent point @xmath60 are not decorrelated ( incidentally , this would be the case if we used dithering ) .    the condition on the signal - to - noise ratio",
    "can be simply understood with the following argument : let us call @xmath138 and suppose that it takes the maximum value according to the third condition above here , @xmath139 .",

    "this gives a first explanation why we do not treat the case @xmath5 .",
    "taking @xmath147 corresponds to a maximum rate for the constellation that equals capacity , as can be understood from the following calculation : from we can derive that @xmath148 this implies that @xmath149 observe that the previous formula shows how decoding @xmath118 enhances the strength of the constellation , as if we had an `` effective '' signal - to - noise ratio @xmath150 .",
    "this heuristically explains how we manage to gain the `` plus 1 '' in the formula @xmath0 , which was the conjectured maximum achievable rate in this context , before the introduction of mmse scaling @xcite .",
    "the same argument was pointed out in erez and zamir s work @xcite . to conclude , recall that we make the hypothesis that @xmath135 ; this and can be used to show that the awgn capacity is @xmath151 which is exactly the rate of our constellation .",
    "a stronger rate would go beyond capacity , the `` effective '' noise would make @xmath152 exceed @xmath153 and no reliable decoding could be guaranteed .      what we have explained till now gives an intuitive description of the typical geometry that characterises the awg noise and the random voronoi constellations of construction - a nested lattices .",
    "nevertheless , it does not directly drop a hint on the original idea behind our proof that allows to avoid dithering .",
    "it is worth the effort of spending some words about that now , before moving on to the detailed proof .",
    "the main argument is the following : if @xmath118 is the real point that the receiver passes to the lattice decoder , we fix as our working environment the sphere @xmath154 , which we call the _ decoding sphere_. after ensuring that the sent point @xmath60 lies in it , our general strategy aims to prove that it is the only lattice point inside the _ decoding sphere_. this would imply that lattice decoding does not fail , but unfortunately this does not happen for every instance of the awg noise and may not happen for every point of the constellation . hence , we apply an averaging argument that leads among other things to the estimation of ( a more elaborate version of ) the following sum : @xmath155 showing that this sum vanishes when @xmath4 tends to infinity will be our main goal .",
    "it will be clear later that the best situation possible is when the two events @xmath156 and @xmath157 are independent ; but , in principle , they may not be , also because the multiplication by @xmath73 adds some correlation between @xmath60 and the `` effective '' noise @xmath158 . one can interpret erez and zamir s dithering technique as a method of eliminating this correlation .",
    "we do not use dither and consequently there will be _ a priori _ some @xmath60 for which the probability in the previous sum takes a `` big '' value , while at the same time we need to show that the whole sum is `` small '' .",
    "the originality of our analysis consists of deducing that the proportion of this kind of points in the constellation is very small and the total error decoding probability still goes to @xmath70 when @xmath4 tends to infinity ( see lemma [ lem : good_points ] and its application to in the proof of theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity ] ) .",
    "from now on , we will go into all the technical aspects of our proof that there exists a random capacity - achieving construction - a lattice family .",
    "this result will be formally stated and proved in theorem [ thm : awgn_capacity ] . for the sake of clearness , we have taken out of its proof a certain number of lemmas , that we present below here . except for lemma [ lem : typical_norm ] ,",

    "in the first part of this paper , we have given a new proof that random construction - a voronoi constellations achieve the capacity of the awgn channel with lattice encoding and decoding .",
    "we have obtained this result without employing the dithering technique , thus simplifying the information transmission scheme with respect to other solutions proposed in the literature . also , we have explicitly shown how the prime number @xmath3 that underlies construction a has to grow as a function of the lattice dimension @xmath4 : it is of the same order as @xmath28 , for a positive constant @xmath27 whose lower bound varies between @xmath778 and @xmath779 depending on the rate of the linear code involved in the construction .",
    "the proof of this capacity result is also based on a lemma which states the sphericity of our voronoi random constellation : its points typically lie very close to the surface of a ball , called the shaping sphere , whose radius is the effective radius of the shaping lattice .    the second part of the paper is dedicated to lda lattices .",
    "we have adapted the arguments used in the case of random construction a to show the novel result that there exists a family of lda voronoi constellations which is capacity - achieving under lattice encoding and decoding .",
    "again , we have expressed in formulae the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath4 , finding lower bounds of @xmath27 that are still constant , but larger than the ones of the random - construction - a case .",

    "one important feature of our lda ensemble is that the row and column hamming weights of the associated parity - check matrices are well - determined constants and do not need to grow with @xmath4 .",
