    "light is called sub - poissonian when the variance of the number of photo - detection events counted over a large time duration is less than the average number of events .",
    "equivalently , we may say that the photo - current spectral density is below the shot - noise level at low fourier ( or baseband ) frequencies .",
    "it has been shown experimentally in 1987 @xcite that laser diodes driven by high - resistance electrical sources may generate sub - poissonian light .",
    "this feature of great fundamental and practical importance treated theoretically in @xcite on the basis of the laws of quantum optics may be understood alternatively as resulting from a birth - death markov process @xcite .",
    "such processes , as they apply to lasers in general , were discussed in particular by jakeman and loudon @xcite .",
    "the reader will find a clear mathematical discussion in @xcite .",
    "the originality of the present simulation rests on the fact that electronic level occupancies and light quanta are accounted for _ individually _ , the photo - detection rate being derived from a monte carlo simulation of the system evolution in the course of time .",
    "all microscopic physical processes are ( or could be ) accounted for .",
    "electron level occupancies ( 0 or 1 ) fluctuate as a result of internal electronic transitions ( auger transitions , thermalization and interaction with the optical field stored in the laser cavity ) , pumping and optical absorption .",
    "an exhaustive monte carlo simulation has apparently not been reported before , probably because of the high computer time required in the case of bulk semiconductor lasers . but",
    "dramatic size reductions have been obtained with microcavity quantum dot lasers @xcite and two - dimensional photonic - bandgap quantum - dots lasers @xcite . because the active layers involve few optically active quantum dots in the gain region an individual account of each level occupancy is manageable .",
    "such devices , likely to be the next generation semiconductor lasers provided technological problems are overcome to achieve efficient electrical pumping , may be labeled ` mesoscopic ' because of their small size .",
    "note that in optical computing applications only small optical output powers are needed and small driving currents are desired .    for conventional applications , e.g. , optical communications , milliwatts of powers are usually required . in that case ,",
    "our simulation results have to be scaled up since it would be impractical to account for every level occupancy in the case of bulk semiconductors . scaling laws applicable to the linearized theory need generalization if one wishes to take into account advanced effects such as spectral - hole burning .",
    "our numerical results help ascertain the validity of advanced theories .",
    "the main processes involved in laser light generation are recalled in section [ process ] , and the numerical procedure is explained in section [ birth - death ] .",
    "numerical results concerning photodetection noise are illustrated in section [ results ] and the conclusion in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the analytical formula in the appendix derives from the birth - death process through linearization and the assumption that the fermi - dirac distribution at some constant temperature @xmath0 adequately describes electronic level occupancies .",
    "an explicit expression of the photo - detection spectrum is obtained for evenly - spaced electronic levels ( spacing @xmath1 ) and a non - fluctuating electron injection rate @xmath2 .",
    "it is shown that the photo - detection spectrum depends only on the light absorption constant @xmath3 and the normalized pumping rate @xmath4 .",
    "in the present section the basic physics of semiconductors , and processes relevant to isolated cavities containing semiconductors in contact with a thermal bath , are first recalled . pumping and optical absorption",
    "are discussed subsequently .",
    "one - electron energy levels in the semiconductor are supposed to be of the form @xmath5 , with @xmath6 an integer and @xmath1 a constant .",
    "the lasers considered may incorporate quantum dots in the gain region .",
    "the evenly - spaced - level assumption is then justified by the mechanism of level ` repulsion ' observed in nanometer - scale irregular particles @xcite : the probability that adjacent levels be separated by @xmath1 is of the form @xmath7 , a sharply peaked function of @xmath1 .",
    "note also that quantum wells exhibit levels that are evenly spaced _ on the average _ within each sub - bands .",
    "that is , the density of states is a constant .",
    "some levels are allowed while others are forbidden .",
    "allowed levels may be occupied by at most one electron to comply with the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the electron spin , ignored in the present paper for the sake of brevity , is discussed for example in @xcite .",
    "our model considers neither electronic superposition states nor any strong coulomb interaction , approximations made in virtually all laser - diode theories . in semiconductors the allowed electronic levels group into two bands , the upper one being called _ conduction _ band ( cb ) and the lower one _ valence _ band ( vb ) .",
    "we suppose that both bands involve the same number @xmath8 of levels , and are separated by @xmath9 forbidden levels as shown in fig .",
    "the band gap energy @xmath10 is instrumental in determining the laser oscillation frequency but it will not enter in our model because of simplifying assumptions to be later discussed",
    ". only one valence band is considered , but it would be straightforward to take into account the heavy - hole , light - hole and split - off bands found in most semiconductors .",
    "@xmath11 electrons are allocated to the allowed energy levels . for pure semiconductors at @xmath12",
    "k , the @xmath13 electrons fill up the valence band while the conduction band is empty .",
    "the electron - lattice system is electrically neutral .    without a thermal bath ,",
    "the electron gas reaches an equilibrium state through auger - type transitions : an electron gets promoted to upper levels while another electron gets demoted to lower levels in such a way that the total energy remains the same .",
    "the two electrons may belong to the same band or to distinct bands , but only the former situation is presently considered .",
    "auger transitions ensure that all the system microstates are being explored in the course of time so that electron gases possess well - defined temperatures at any instant in each band .",
    "nothing , however , prevents these temperatures from fluctuating in the course of time .",
    "the coulomb interactions on which auger processes rely is supposed to be weak , so that one - electron level schemes are applicable . we have simulated energy - conserving processes and recovered recently - reported theoretical expressions for electron occupancies @xcite . when @xmath14 the fermi - dirac ( fd ) distribution is recovered with great accuracy .",
    "but @xmath15 needs not be very large compared with @xmath1 in mesoscopic devices , _",
    "e.g. _ , short quantum wires or quantum dots .",
    "note that laser noise depends in general , not only on active levels _ average _ occupancies , but also on the fact that , even in the equilibrium ( or quasi - equilibrium ) state , electrons keep moving in and out these levels , causing the optical gain to fluctuate .",
    "it is only in the linearized theory ( see the appendix of the present paper ) that statistical gain fluctuations may be ignored .",
    "such fluctuations are automatically taken into account in monte - carlo simulations .",
    "let us now consider the process of thermalization between the electron gas and the lattice .",
    "to enforce thermalization each electron is ascribed a probability @xmath16 per unit time of being demoted to the adjacent lower level provided this level is empty , and a probability @xmath17 , where @xmath18 of being promoted to the adjacent upper level if it is empty . strictly speaking",
    ", this thermalization model would be applicable to solids with @xmath19 , but the detailed modeling turns out to be rather unimportant . if @xmath16 is large , thermalization is very efficient .",
    "this implies that electron - gas temperatures in both bands are equal to the lattice temperature , i.e. , are constant in the course of time .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to consider the noise spectrum when @xmath16 is not large , in which case electron gas temperatures are ill defined .",
    "near equilibrium , it is immaterial whether auger or thermalization transitions are dominant since both lead to well - defined temperatures and , in the appropriate limit , to the fd distribution .",
    "but because lasers are out of equilibrium systems , intensity - noise spectra do depend on which one of the auger or thermalization processes dominates .",
    "spontaneous radiative electronic decay ( involving radiation into free space ) may be accounted for by ascribing to each electron in the conduction band a probability of dropping to some empty level in the valence band .",
    "the noise associated with this process is automatically expressed by the monte carlo simulation .",
    "for the sake of brevity , this process is presently ignored .",
    "spontaneous decay may be neglected when the driving current exceeds approximately ten times the threshold current .",
    "consider now an isolated system consisting of a single - mode optical cavity resonating at angular frequency @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 being an integer , and containing some electron gas .",
    "precisely , we suppose that the coherent interaction takes place between the middle of the conduction band and the middle of the valence band , that is : @xmath23 .",
    "a prerequisite of the monte carlo method is that the optical field enters only through the number @xmath24 of light quanta .",
    "that is , photonic superposition states , as well as electronic superposition states , are not considered in the present theory .",
    "quantum optics effects such as trapped states , resonance fluorescence , and collective effects such as superfluorescence are indeed ignored .",
    "this conforms with the classical rate equation treatment of lasers , found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "recent rigorous calculations relating to the mesomaser validate rate - equation methods by showing that even with few atoms ( or electron - hole pairs ) typical quantum optics effects get washed out @xcite . a particle - like monte carlo method applied to optical amplifiers",
    "@xcite also shows convergence toward the rate equation model .",
    "stimulated absorption is modelled by assigning a probability @xmath24 to electrons in the lower working level to be promoted to the upper working level ( if that level is empty ) .",
    "stimulated emission is modeled by assigning a probability @xmath25 to electrons in the upper working level to be demoted to the lower working level ( if that level is empty ) . in the laser theory",
    "the `` 1 '' of the einstein expression @xmath25 may be neglected in the steady - state because @xmath24 is a large number .",
    "the term `` 1 '' should be kept however in the monte carlo simulation because the initial value of @xmath24 considered is 0 . without that term , laser start - up would not occur .",
    "setting as unity the factor that multiplies the expressions @xmath24 or @xmath25 amounts to selecting a time scale .",
    "optical pumping ( from a thermal source , for example ) would be modeled by assigning some constant probability to electrons in low valence - band levels to be promoted to high conduction - band levels , provided these levels are empty , _ and _ almost the same probability for the opposite transition . in that case",
    "the pumping rate fluctuations would be close to the shot - noise level .",
    "but the electrical current generated by cold high - impedance electrical sources is almost non - fluctuating as a consequence of the nyquist theorem , as was first shown by yamamoto .",
    "the nature of the detected light depends on the ratio of this impedance to the intrinsic dynamic resistance of the laser @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to perfectly regular electrical pumping , _",
    "i.e. _ to infinite cold impedances . quiet electrical pumping is modeled by promoting low - lying electrons into high - lying levels _ periodically _ in time , every @xmath26  ns , corresponding to a pumping rate @xmath27 . because the time period considered is very short in comparison with the time scales of interest , this prescription implies that the pumping rate is nearly constant .",
    "this has been verified numerically .",
    "light quanta absorption is supposed to be due to the detector alone , that is , no additional optical loss is being considered . without loss of generality ,",
    "the detector is supposed to be located inside the optical cavity , as in many early classical laser - noise theories .",
    "it is in fact immaterial whether the detector is located inside the resonator or is coupled to the cavity through some partially transmitting mirrors , as long as no spurious reflection occurs .",
    "detecting atoms are assigned a probability @xmath28 of being promoted to the upper state , where @xmath3 denotes a constant . once in the excited state ,",
    "detecting atoms are presumed to decay non - radiatively back to their ground state .",
    "the method is best explained by considering first time intervals @xmath29 small enough that the probability that an event of a particular kind occurs within it is small compared with unity , and that the probability of two or more events occurring is negligible , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath30s .",
    "a typical run lasts @xmath31s , corresponding to @xmath32 elementary time intervals .",
    "the total number of events per run is on the order of @xmath33 .",
    "averaging is made over 20 independent runs . instead of the above pedestrian approach ,",
    "the algorithm actually employed accounts more rigorously for the birth - death process and minimizes the cpu time .    stimulated decay of an electron during an elementary time interval @xmath29 is allowed to occur with probability @xmath34 , @xmath24 being incremented by @xmath35 if the event does occur .",
    "likewise , stimulated electron promotion is allowed to occur with probability @xmath36 , @xmath24 being reduced by 1 if the event occurs .",
    "the fact that the proportionality constant has been omitted amounts to selecting a time unit , typically , 1 ns .    thermalization is required for steady - state laser operation . in the computer model ,",
    "thermalization is ensured by ascribing to each electron a probability @xmath37 to decay to the adjacent lower level if that level is empty , and a probability @xmath38 to be promoted to the adjacent upper level if that level is empty , where @xmath39 denotes the boltzmann factor .",
    "we select @xmath40  k , corresponding to @xmath41 . without absorption and pumping ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) , the program gives level occupancies very close to those predicted by the fermi - dirac ( fd ) distribution .",
    "only regular pumping is considered with an electron at the bottom of the vb promoted to the top of the cb every @xmath26  ns .",
    "this period corresponds to a pumping rate @xmath44 events per ns , and a pump electrical current in the na range . for a 1  @xmath45m  long quantum wire with a 10  nm @xmath46 10  nm cross - section this corresponds to @xmath47  a/@xmath48",
    "each light quantum is ascribed a constant probability @xmath49 of being absorbed by the photodetector , with @xmath50 .",

    "the corresponding time and the number of light quanta stored in the cavity are respectively @xmath53  ns and @xmath54 .",
    "the first event at @xmath55  ns is a vb thermalization .",
    "its effect is to decrement the system energy of @xmath1 since an electron is demoted by one energy step .",
    "the second event at @xmath56  ns is an electrical pumping event that promotes the vb electron occupying the lowest energy level to the highest energy level of the cb .",

    "the number of light quanta is incremented from @xmath54 to @xmath58 .    except for the pumping events",
    "all the processes are governed by a poisson probability law .",
    "it follows that the whole system aside from pumping events also obeys a poisson probability law .",
    "knowledge of the laser microscopic state at time @xmath59 implies knowledge of the next - jump density function .",
    "an exact monte carlo simulation @xcite of the laser evolution is then easily obtained by randomly picking up the next event time @xmath60 from a poisson law and , next , picking the event type from a uniform law weighted by the count of potential events for each type .",

    "an increase of temperature from 100  k to 132k does not suffice to reproduce the observed shift .",
    "the change in spectral density may be attributed to spectral - hole burning and carrier heating .",
    "the bottom curve corresponds to poor thermalization .",
    "the relaxation oscillation is strongly damped .",

    ", it is verified that sub - poissonian light may be obtained .",
    "but when the thermal contact is poor , as is the case when lasers are driven to high powers , the simple theory is found to be inaccurate . some of the changes observed may be accounted for by temperature increase and gain compression ( due to spectral - hole burning ) .",

    "a simple explicit expression for the spectral density of the photo - detection rate is presently derived .",

    "randomness in laser operation enters mainly because stimulated transitions obey _ probability _ rather than deterministic laws .",
    "the alternative interpretation of laser noise as resulting from the field spontaneously emitted into the oscillating mode , though plausible on some respects , does not seem able to lead in a natural manner to sub - poissonian output light statistics , see @xcite .",

    "the equation describing the evolution of the number @xmath68 of electrons in the conduction band , on the other hand , involves the constant pump rate @xmath2 ( quiet pump ) .",
