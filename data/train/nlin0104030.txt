    "partial differential equations describing continuous models and real physical systems can , in many cases , be discretized into a system of coupled map lattices ( cml ) .",
    "coupled map lattices are spatiotemporal dynamical systems comprised of an interacting array of discrete - time maps .",
    "much attention to these systems has been drawn in virtue of studies of generic properties of spatiotemporal chaos , @xcite,@xcite . a mean - field extension of cml",
    "is the globally coupled map lattice introduced by kaneko @xcite .",
    "here we consider another mean - field extension which refers to random networks of coupled maps .",
    "although just a few studies devoted to randomly coupled chaotic map networks ( rcmn ) have been reported by this time , it is beyond dispute that such systems would be very rich in practical applications . to motivate the increasing interest rcmn , one has to note that most real - world networks are of a disordered nature .",
    "social networks @xcite , biological communities forming food webs @xcite , and , moreover , computer networks @xcite , to name just few , have plenty of random shortcuts inconsistent with any regular structure . in this context ,",
    "interesting investigations of coupled map systems defined on non - uniform lattices have been reported in @xcite ( cmls on a sierpinski gasket ) and in @xcite ( cmls on a cayley tree ) . in view of this , an ensemble of maps coupled at random would provide a forthright model for studying various properties of these disordered networks .",
    "the thorough investigation of rcmn would shed new light on the problem of spatiotemporal behavior of discrete extended systems having infinitely many degrees of freedom .    to our knowledge , randomly coupled logistic maps @xmath0 have been considered first in @xcite .",

    "the somewhat  statistically simplest \" rcmn is considered . on one hand ,",
    "the chat - manneville map ( cm ) @xcite which we use as a local evolution law can be either in a chaotic or  turbulent \" ( excited ) state , or in a fixed point or  laminar \" ( inhibited ) state .",
    "on the other hand , the network topology in our model is spanned by a random graph @xmath1 , corresponding to @xmath2 sites and such that each site has precisely @xmath3 outgoing edges .    in the present article",
    ", we show that the entire collective behavior is the net result of the interplay between the properties of local map and the probabilistic topology of relevant random graph .",
    "let us note that , in the domain of coupled chaotic maps , the notion of phase transition has been traditionally applied to at least two different classes of phenomena .",
    "the first class constitutes the case when a valuable fraction of nodes in the lattice becomes either excited or inhibited at some critical values of the parameters .",
    "we shall call these situations either as a transition to intermittency or to relaminarization .",
