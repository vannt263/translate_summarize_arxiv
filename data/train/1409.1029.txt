    "early - type galaxies ( elliptical and lenticular , hereafter etgs ) are well - known precious high - redshift candidates to trace observationally the formation and evolution of the main structures in the universe , since they are the most massive and so the brightest galaxies and contain most of the local observed stars and baryons ( @xcite and references therein ) . also the homogeneous properties of their stellar content put them in a privileged position to explore the history of their stellar mass assembly .    despite the lower quality and quantity of high - redshift data , direct measurements on the stellar populations of high-@xmath7",
    "galaxies still remain the best solid way to constrain the earlier evolution of etgs @xcite .",
    "in fact , the possibility of detecting direct pieces of evidence of stellar evolution , both through photometric and spectroscopic data , is almost unique in a redshift range , i.e. @xmath8 , where most of the etg evolution is expected @xcite . a second convenience of dealing with high-@xmath7 data is the more reliable use of the synthetic modelling which , thanks to the relative young ages of high-@xmath7 sources , is significantly less affected by degeneracy effects , e.g. age - metallicity degeneracy which is dominant in the local etgs .    up to now , the most used method to explore the stellar population properties of high-@xmath7",
    "etgs is the analysis of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) by means of multiband photometry @xcite .",
    "however , the physical parameters extracted from the sed fitting process on synthetic models , like in particular age , are actually only indicative mean values ; thus , this method misses the detection of the possible presence of inhomogeneities in the stellar content .",
    "in contrast , a restricted but more detailed spectroscopic analysis would be an interesting challenge to unveil that information lost in the whole sed analysis .    the important goal to be reached through the analysis of the stellar population properties of galaxies observed at @xmath9 in their critical state of evolution , is to understand if all of their stars are coeval and still passively evolving , as they are usually modelled with @xmath10 @xcite , or there are some pieces of evidence of later star forming episodes or minor merging events which led to composite stellar populations already at @xmath9 .    the hidden complexity of the star formation history of etgs has been revealed by many works on local etgs @xcite , and at intermediate redshift @xcite , where different kinds of signature suggest that elliptical galaxies have possibly undergone rejuvenation episodes in their recent history . also at high redshift , with both archaeological and direct measurements",
    ", the necessity of introducing multiple stellar populations , with different stellar properties , in the used modelling has been found @xcite .",
    "the main stellar properties involved in the differentiation of stellar components are age and metallicity . however , age is surely the first stellar parameter which should be investigated on high-@xmath7 etgs .",
    "in fact , direct spectroscopic measurements of stellar metallicity on high-@xmath7 etgs are still a hard issue ; moreover , @xcite found that age gradients are necessary to reproduce the majority of the observed high-@xmath7 colour gradients .",
    "coexistent different stellar populations in etgs are expected from the theoretical models on galaxy formation and evolution : minor mergers and small accretion events instead of major mergers , in fact , are predicted to be frequent until @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this inside out formation scenario , however , predicts that for high mass galaxies , accreted stars have been formed in the same epoch of `` _ _ in situ _ _ '' stars @xcite , assembling thus composite stellar populations of rather coeval stellar content , though the minor mergers have occurred at different times .",
    "so the attention now should be focused on finding some observables which allow one to understand how homogeneous are the stellar populations of elliptical galaxies and how important are the mass fraction and the age of the accreted stars .",
    "a spectroscopic analysis on a sample of high-@xmath7 etgs can surely reveal precious details on their stellar properties , to shed light on the composition of the stellar populations of galaxies in their earlier phases of evolution .",
    "previously , other pioneer works @xcite have been devoted to the analysis of spectroscopic high-@xmath7 data , revealing many differences in the stellar properties of @xmath12 objects with respect to local etgs , such as the presence of extreme values of spectral indices not foreseen by models @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present our spectroscopic analysis of a small sample of etgs based on some of the first high quality optical spectroscopic data at @xmath9 in the goods - south field , which , thanks to the measurements of reliable age - dependent spectrophotometric indices in the @xmath0@xmath1 rest frame region , i.e. the h+k(ca`ii ` ) and @xmath2 , has led to interesting results on this topic .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sample ] we introduce our sample and describe the spectroscopic data with the main passes of the data reduction . in section [ indici ]",
    "we present the definition and the measurements of the spectrophotometric indices which are the basis of our spectral analysis .",
    "the comparison of the obtained results with synthetic stellar population models is widely discussed in section [ analisi ] , together with the description of our proposed double - component models . in section [ discussione ]",
    "we discuss our results through the comparison with other works based on high-@xmath7 spectral analysis .",
    "we propose the summary and our conclusion in section [ conclusione ] .    throughout this paper , we assume a standard cosmology with h@xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "all photometric magnitudes are expressed in the ab system .",
    "the sample consists of @xmath3 etgs at @xmath4 morphologically selected from a catalogue complete to @xmath17 ( tamburri et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , in the southern field of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods - south v2 ; giavalisco et al @xmath18 ) .",
    "the selection criterion of this sample was basically the availability of sufficient high - quality ( s / n @xmath19 ) spectroscopic data to perform the measurements of the main spectrophotometric indices in the @xmath0@xmath1 break region , which is the aim of this work .",
    "thus , starting from the complete sample of @xmath20 morphologically selected etgs with @xmath21 , only @xmath3 could provide a high - s / n spectrum suitable for the present study ( see section [ spectroscopic ] for details ) .",
    "all the selected galaxies have the 14 bands goods - south survey coverage @xcite : deep optical images taken from four _ hubble space telescope_-advance camera for surveys bandpasses ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) ; photometric data provided by extensive observations of european southern observatory ( eso ) telescopes both in the optical ( three @xmath26-band filters ) and in the near - infrared ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 filters ) , and by the four _ spitzer - infrared array camera bands _ ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 m ) .",
    "thanks to these multiwavelength data we were able to perform the global sed fitting of all the galaxies of the sample in order to extract the global stellar population properties .",
    "the sed fitting process was carried out assuming the stellar population synthesis model of bruzual and charlot @xcite ( hereafter bc03 ) with a chabrier initial mass function ( imf)@xcite .",
    "we adopted star formation histories with five exponentially declining star formation rates with @xmath34-folding time @xmath35[@xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 gyr and assumed solar metallicity z @xmath41 .",
    "dust extinction , following @xcite , was applied in the range @xmath42 mag . in table",
    "[ tab : fotom ] , we report the stellar parameters obtained from the sed fitting of the 15 etgs : photometric ages @xmath43 of the stellar populations , dust extinction @xmath44 , stellar masses @xmath45 and star formation time - scale @xmath46 .    for five objects out of the whole sample ( those at the highest spectral resolution )",
    "the velocity dispersion measures are available @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath47 out of the @xmath3 target galaxies ( those at @xmath48 ) are included in the complete sample of the goods - south field etgs at @xmath49 @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : indicionodera ]    in their figure @xmath50 , onodera and collaborators showed the comparison of their measurements with the predictions of synthetic models ( charlot @xmath51 bruzual , in preparation ) assuming four different star formation histories and most of their objects are not consistent with any of the displayed models .",
    "we add our lower redshift sample in the same h@xmath52 versus d@xmath53 plane , and the result is shown in figure [ confrontodoubleonoderajor ] ( top panels ) .",
    "indeed , on average , at fixed d@xmath54 index value , the h@xmath52 index value is either higher than expected from models or too low to find any correspondence with models ( with @xmath55 gyr and solar metallicity , black line in figure [ confrontodoubleonoderajor ] , top panels ) .",
    "we then proceeded with the same arguments followed in the previous sections , considering double stellar components models .",
    "the top - left panel of figure [ confrontodoubleonoderajor ] presents composite models with the younger component at fixed age @xmath56 gyr , while in the top - right panel the minor component is so young , @xmath57 myr , to present emission lines and to produce negative values of the h@xmath52 index .",
    "double - component models with the adding of gas emission are successful in explaining many of the data points of both samples , in particular those with lower values of both indices .",
    "unfortunately , those points with extreme high values of h@xmath52 ( and relative high values of d@xmath54 index ) remain still unexplained with any combinations of stellar component ages , as already noticed by @xcite .             focusing only on our sample data ( red points in figure [ confrontodoubleonoderajor ] , top panels ) , it is worth to stress that the obtained spread in the h@xmath52 versus d@xmath54 index plane is more restrained than that in the h+k(ca`ii ` ) versus @xmath2 index plane discussed in this work ( see figure [ confrontomodelli ] ) .",
    "this is due to the lower sensitivity of the h@xmath52 index respect to that of the h+k(ca`ii ` ) index to the presence of very small amounts of young stars .",
    "as explained in section [ indici ] , indeed , the measure of the h line depth and its ratio with the k line is influenced almost only by the blended h@xmath58 line depth , making the values of their ratio ( i.e. h+k(ca`ii ` ) index ) a very sensible tools for detecting young stellar populations .",
    "the larger effectiveness of the h+k(ca`ii ` ) index with respect to the h@xmath52 index in finding the younger component is easily verified looking at the synthetic models .",
    "colored lines in figure [ confrontodoubleonoderajor ] ( top left panel ) indicate the values of the h@xmath52 and d@xmath54 indices of double - component models with increasing fractions of the younger component , and it can be noticed that the detachment from the single - component model ( black line ) is limited with respect to what obtained in figure [ confrontodouble ] in the case of h+k(ca`ii ` ) index .",
    "interestingly , from both top panels of figure [ confrontodoubleonoderajor ] , it can be noticed that data points of our sample ( red points ) stay closer to models than those of @xcite .",
    "since our points refer to lower @xmath7 galaxies , we thus looked for a correlation of this spreading with redshift .",
    "we separated the entire sample of galaxies in five subsets with different range of redshift : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in figure",
    "[ variazionez ] , we present the same plot of figure [ confrontodoubleonoderajor ] , but with only a representative single - component model ( black line , with @xmath55 gyr and solar metallicity ) .",
    "colours of the data points go from yellow , low - redshift objects ( @xmath59 ) , to dark red , the highest redshift ( @xmath64 ) . from this plot ,",
    "it is clear that low-@xmath7 data stay closer to the model than those with high @xmath7 and that the more the redshift increases , the more the data are widespread in the index index plane , i.e. more distant from models .",
    "furthermore , in figure @xmath50 in @xcite , the authors present the comparison of their high-@xmath7 data with local sdss passive galaxies , and the trend seems to be confirmed : local objects are generally well represented by single - component models with respect to high-@xmath7 data . in high - redshift objects ,",
    "differences of ages among possible multiple stellar components are easier to be detected thanks to the younger mean ages , for which even small age differences produce strong signatures ( e.g. balmer lines depth ) , while in the local universe the same age differences are almost impossible to be detected for the stellar population ageing , thus vanishing the opportunity of observing the presence of double components .",
    "indeed , two stellar populations with @xmath65 and @xmath66 gyr , respectively , have almost the same balmer lines depth .",
    "this strengthens the advantage of dealing with direct spectral measurements of higher redshift etgs in order to study their star formation history .     versus d@xmath54 plot .",
    "black line is the single - component model with @xmath55 gyr and solar metallicity .",
    "data from the sample of @xcite and this work galaxies .",
    "data points are divided into five redshift bins ( from yellow to dark red crosses ) : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "errors bars are omitted for simplicity ; they would be the same as in figure [ confrontodoubleonoderajor].,width=340 ]    the second interesting comparison is with the work by @xcite .",
    "their analysis is based on high - s / n optical spectroscopy of the early - type members of three galaxy clusters at @xmath67 in the framework of the `` the gemini / hst galaxy cluster project '' @xcite .",
    "we limited our comparison to the highest @xmath7 clusters which are the rxj0152.7 - 1357 at @xmath68 and rxj1226.9 + 3332 at @xmath69 , because they match the average redshift of our sample .",
    "for these galaxy clusters , in particular , the authors make available the measurements of some spectrophotometric indices obtained from the gmos - n instrument ( r @xmath70 ) .",
    "they adopt the same definition of the @xmath2 index as we adopted , and the definition of the h@xmath71 by @xcite , different from that of @xcite . in order to perform the comparison , we thus measured the values of the h@xmath71 of our sample galaxies , and the results are listed in column @xmath57 of table [ tab : indicionodera ] .",
    "once again we compared the results with the expectation of the single - component bc03 models ( black line , with @xmath55 gyr and solar metallicity ) , in figure [ confrontodoubleonoderajor ] , bottom panels .",
    "data points from @xcite ( black points ) remain relative close to the single - component model predictions ( black line ) , in agreement with the measure of our sample , supporting the previous finding that the secondary younger component is more evident at increasing @xmath7 . in order to preserve the graphic clearness , in figure [ confrontodoubleonoderajor ] only data points belonging to rxj1226.9 + 3332 galaxy cluster are shown . in figure",
    "[ confrontodoubleonoderajor ] , bottom - left panel , we report the comparison of both the two sample data with the double - component models ( colored lines ) , the same as in the top - left panel : points with higher values of h@xmath71 index at fixed @xmath2 index value result fully explained by adding a small mass fraction of young stars .",
    "on the other hand , only some of our sample data points ( red points ) have lower values of h@xmath71 index at fixed @xmath2 index and they can be again explained with double - component models adding very young stellar components displaying balmer emission lines . in particular , it is interesting to note that the three objects id-9066 , id-10960 and id-1837 of our sample , highlighted with labels in figure [ confrontodoubleonoderajor ] ( bottom - right panel ) , have h@xmath71 and @xmath2 indices which are consistent with double - component models displaying emission lines in agreement with the results found using the h+k(ca`ii ` ) index with respect to the h@xmath71 one in this work ( see figure [ confrontodouble ] , right - hand panel ) .    finally , we remark that in the bottom panels of figure [ confrontodoubleonoderajor ] , we are comparing in the same plots data coming from two samples of galaxies at about the same mean redshift but in different environments : our sample ( red points ) is composed of field galaxies , i.e. low - density environment ( with mean @xmath68 ) , while @xcite sample ( black points ) is composed exclusively of galaxies belonging to the cluster rxj1226.9 + 3332 at @xmath69 .",
    "the fact that the galaxies of the sample of @xcite do not need on average the presence of a second stellar component modelled with balmer emission lines , means that in general their stellar populations are homogeneous , i.e. formed in a single or very short burst with no secondary bursts , in agreement with the well - known results of @xcite , where high - density environment galaxies are expected to form their star earlier than low - density counterparts and in a shorter time - scale ( see figure 10 in @xcite ) .",
    "supposedly , many cluster objects have experienced the same mechanism of star formation and assembling of our sample etgs that led to the presence of stellar components with different properties , but these events must have occurred earlier in the cosmic time and are less appreciable at the observation redshift .",
    "we presented a spectroscopic analysis based on the measurements of age - dependent specrophotometric indices in the region of @xmath0@xmath1 rest frame on high - redshift etgs .",
    "we based our analysis on all the up - to - now publicly available optical spectra of etgs at @xmath9 in the goods - south field , with ascertained morphological classification ( see tamburri et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , and with sufficient high - s / n ratio in the region of @xmath0@xmath1 break rest frame to allow a detailed spectral analysis",
    ". the sample was then composed of @xmath3 etgs at @xmath72 , whose spectral data came from three observing campaigns performed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    from the reduced monodimensional spectra , we have measured the values of the two age - dependent spectrophotometric indices : h+k(ca`ii ` ) and @xmath2 .",
    "the choice of these indices was supported by their sensitivity to the presence of multiple stellar populations with different age . in particular ,",
    "we have stressed the peculiarity of the h+k(ca`ii ` ) index of being very sensitive to age variations even in the case of small amounts of very young stellar content .    from the comparison of the index values with the expectations of single - component bc03 models",
    ", we found that many measured values deviate significantly from models . nor synthetic models with different star formation time - scale @xmath46 neither those with different metallicity could explain the discrepancy from the ages indicated by the @xmath2 index ( in general older ) and those pointed out by the h+k(ca`ii ` ) index .",
    "furthermore , particularly intriguing it was the finding of some values of the h+k(ca`ii ` ) index which were too high to find any correspondence with models .",
    "such a behaviour has thus been attributed to inhomogeneous properties of the stellar populations in the sample galaxies , in particular to age variations .",
    "simple models where the bulk of the star formation happened in a dominant initial event ( within a time - scale @xmath46 ) are not able to explain our results : a further degree of complexity is necessary to understand the star formation history of our sample galaxies .",
    "to take into account these inhomogeneities , we then introduced in the modelling a second star formation event , thus considering the stellar population composed of two stellar components which differ from their ages . adopting composite models ,",
    "the result is that a small mass percentage of younger stellar component is enough to explain those index values that were not consistent with single - component models . in particular , those high values of the h+k(ca`ii ` ) index could be explained introducing the contribution of gas emission lines , due to the presence of star forming regions . indeed",
    ", small mass fractions of very young components ( @xmath73 gyr ) , where the star formation is still ongoing and the h@xmath58 balmer line is in emission , are able to fill the whole h line involved in the h+k(ca`ii ` ) index , thus increasing its expected value . from the fitting analysis we obtained that for at least @xmath5 per cent of the galaxies of our sample there are pieces of evidence of the presence of small mass fractions of a younger population coexisting with a much older stellar bulk .",
    "data suggest that the ages of the _ older _ components follow two distinct distributions with mean ages of @xmath74 and @xmath75 gyr without any correlation with @xmath7 , which correspond to mean formation redshift for the bulk of stars at @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "however , due to the limited number of galaxies of our sample ( @xmath3 ) not uniformly distributed in redshift , these results could be only a selection effect .",
    "moreover , we found that the main component ages tend to be older than what concluded from the standard sed fitting analysis ( in agreement with @xcite analysis on star - forming galaxies ) , with some implications on the stellar mass estimate , which results to be underestimated by a factor of @xmath78 on average .",
    "the following star - forming events ( i.e. the _ younger _ components ) are detected at any redshift of the galaxies of our sample ( @xmath72 ) , so it can not be outlined in a common cosmic period in which the younger component has been accreted .",
    "it appears more likely that the star formation is triggered steadily over the cosmic time within field etgs .    we have supposed the presence of younger components also in higher @xmath7 sample of passive elliptical @xcite up to @xmath79 , and in @xmath9 cluster galaxies @xcite even if based on the h@xmath80 index rather than the h+k(ca`ii ` ) index , the former less sensible to small amounts of young stellar content",
    "we have found that in general , the ages of the minor younger component are less young for galaxies belonging to cluster , and more extreme with the increasing of redshift .    having revealed the presence of small young stellar components in many galaxies in a wide redshift range ( @xmath81 , thanks to the enlarged sample ) implies that there must be a common mechanism by which etgs at any cosmic time either accrete new amounts of young stellar mass by means of minor merging events , or activate new events of star formation almost constantly over time .",
    "minor merger - induced star formation is the most widely accredited hypothesis to explain the presence of ongoing star formation in etgs , since it has been also found in the local universe @xcite .",
    "minor mergers are those with mass ratio ( @xmath82 ) in the range @xmath83 , and our findings on the younger components mass fractions are consistent with this scenario . indeed , adopting the assumption of `` dry '' minor merging , which in general involves a maximum value of gas fraction of @xmath84 per cent of the total accreted mass ( stars+gas ) , the very small fractions of the second components observed in this work , i.e. @xmath85 per cent , result in agreement with this description . on the other hand , obviously , also wet minor merging events are able to explain the origin of the observed younger component , with the accretion of external gas being the driver of new star formation activity",
    ". however , minor merging events do not seem to be so frequent in the cosmic epoch from @xmath9 to now .",
    "indeed , @xcite have found that from @xmath9 to @xmath86 the number of minor merging per red galaxy is @xmath87 ; thus , it seems rather unlikely that in an albeit small sample of @xmath3 galaxies , we found that at least @xmath6 objects ( i.e. @xmath5 per cent ) have recently experienced a minor merging event .",
    "in addition , it must be considered that all these objects have been classified as etgs and their morphology appear all regular ; thus , if merger events have happened in the cosmic histories of these galaxies , they must have taken place at least few gyr earlier with respect to their observation in order to resettle the elliptical morphology . but",
    "this is not in agreement with our findings where the younger component is always observed with age @xmath88 gyr .",
    "moreover , other independent works , such that by @xcite , not only have demonstrated the inhomogeneities of stars in etgs at @xmath12 , but they have also localized the younger component in the inner part of the galaxies .",
    "this naturally leads to the question of what is the physical mechanism which , after the external mass accretion by means of hypothetical merging events , is able to bring only the younger stars to the centre of galaxies at least in the case of dry merger event .    on the other hand",
    ", our finding of a second younger component also in other high-@xmath7 samples suggests that the presence of a small percentage of young stars at any epoch which coexist with the passively evolving older stellar bulk of the galaxy could be common in etgs .",
    "in fact , it is known that etgs contain small fraction of cold molecular gas that could be converted in star formation activity and its presence has been observationally detected in the local universe @xcite . this minimal gas reservoir , besides having a presumed external origin , could also be due to the stellar mass loss or may be left over from the initial star formation major burst in the earlier epochs .",
    "the favoured scenario is that of the cold accretion : it has been shown @xcite that a cold gas mode could be responsible for the star formation in the cosmic history of galaxies and that it can be present , with its filamentary nature and in small quantities , also in spheroidal passive systems where the hot gas mode is dominant . in fact , @xcite show that , from @xmath89 to @xmath86 hot gas mode dominated galaxies , i.e. passive and massive spheroids , can form new stars thanks to small amounts of cold gas , and the involved mass fractions , @xmath90 per cent for stellar masses log(@xmath91)@xmath92 , are fully consistent with the detected mass fractions of the younger component in our analysis sample .",
    "in addition , this scenario could be in agreement with the observed inner position of the younger component , as the cold gas stream is assumed to infall towards the centre of galaxy attracted by the main potential well .",
    "thus , the detected young stellar component in the sample of etgs analysed in the present work suggests that a star formation activity took place steadily over time during the secular evolution of these galaxies , activated by small gas quantities since @xmath12 .",

    "<S> we present a spectroscopic analysis based on measurements of two mainly age - dependent spectrophotometric indices in the @xmath0@xmath1 rest frame region , i.e. h+k(ca`ii ` ) and @xmath2 , for a sample of @xmath3 early - type galaxies ( etgs ) at @xmath4 , morphologically selected in the goods - south field . </S>",
    "<S> ages derived from the two different indices by means of the comparison with stellar population synthesis models , are not consistent with each other for at least nine galaxies ( @xmath5 per cent of the sample ) , while for the remaining six galaxies , the ages derived from their global spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting are not consistent with those derived from the two indices . </S>",
    "<S> we then hypothesized that the stellar content of many galaxies is made of two stellar components with different ages . </S>",
    "<S> the double - component analysis , performed by taking into account both the index values and the observed sed , fully explains the observational data and improves the results of the standard one - component sed fitting in @xmath6 out of the @xmath3 objects , i.e. those for which the two indices point towards two different ages . in all of them </S>",
    "<S> , the bulk of the mass belongs to rather evolved stars , while a small mass fraction is many gyr younger . in some cases , </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the sensitivity of the h+k(ca`ii ` ) index , we find that the minor younger component reveals signs of recent star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the ages of the younger stellar components appears uniformly in time and this suggests that small amounts of star formation could be common during the evolution of high-@xmath7 etgs . </S>",
    "<S> we argue the possibility that these new star formation episodes could be frequently triggered by internal causes due to the presence of small gas reservoir .    </S>",
