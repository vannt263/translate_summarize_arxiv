    "patsis and zachilas [ 1994 ] proposed a method to visualize 4d spaces of section .",
    "it is based on rotation of the 3d projections of the figures in order to understand the geometry of the projections and on color for understanding the distribution of the consequents in the 4th dimension .",
    "this combined information from the rotated , colored , 3d projections allows us to associate specific structures with the dynamical behavior in the neighborhood of periodic orbits .",
    "recently the method has been applied successfully in a series of papers that studied the dynamics in the neighborhood of periodic orbits in a 3d galactic potential [ katsanikas and patsis 2011 , katsanikas et al 2011a , katsanikas et al 2011b ] .",
    "the results of these papers , together with those of the original one by patsis and zachilas [ 1994 ] , as well as further results from work in progress , find a consistency between the shapes of the encountered structures in the 4d spaces of section and the kind of ( in)stability of the periodic orbit . despite the fact that until now no exceptional behavior has been found , the results can not be characterized as generic .",
    "the up to now studied systems are 3d autonomous hamiltonians with potentials suitable to describe stellar motion in 3d rotating galactic disks .",
    "they can be used to investigate observed morphological features out of the equatorial planes of disk galaxies [ patsis et al 2002 ] .",
    "the motivation for investigating the phase space structure of a 4d symplectic map is to check whether or not the behavior encountered in the hamiltonian systems is model dependent .",
    "so , we apply the same technique in the case of a 4d symplectic map and we study the structure of the phase space in the case of stability and in cases of instabilities studied in the katsanikas papers .",
    "our goal is to compare the dynamics of the 4d map with those found in the hamiltonian system , testing in this way the ubiquity of the results of the latter studies .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ meth ] we briefly describe the method , in sec .  [ map ] we present the map we use in our study , in sec .",
    "[ res ] we describe our results and finally we enumerate our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "we consider the map @xmath0 and follow the evolution of the array @xmath1 .",
    "a set of three coordinates , e.g. @xmath2 , are used for the 3d projection , while the fourth coordinate ( e.g. @xmath3 ) determines the color of the consequents .",
    "there is a normalization of the color values in the [ min(@xmath3 ) , max(@xmath3 ) ] interval , which is mapped to [ 0,1 ] . in order to understand the shape of each 3d projection we rotate the figures on the screen of our computer . for presentations on paper",
    "we chose a set of projection angles that help the reader understand the shape of the object we describe in the text .",
    "we use in our applications the `` mathematica '' package . following the intrinsic `` mathematica ''",
    "subroutines our viewpoint is given in spherical coordinates .",
    "the unit for the distance @xmath4 of the consequents of the surface of section from the observer is given by `` mathematica '' in a special scaled coordinate system , in which the longest side of the bounding box has length 1 . for all figures we use @xmath5 .",
    "the method associates the smooth distribution or the mixing of colors , with specific types of dynamical behavior in the 4th dimension [ patsis and zachilas 1994 , katsanikas and patsis 2011 , katsanikas et al 2011a , katsanikas et al 2011b ] . for a more detailed description see [ katsanikas and patsis 2011 ]",
    "the map we have chosen , @xmath6 , belongs to a family of nonlinear symplectic 4d mappings in @xmath7 that is a generalization of the standard map .",
    "the definition in the general form is : @xmath8    several cases of the maps of this family have been used in the past to study the dynamics in the neighborhood of fixed points .",
    "already froeschl [ 1972 ] used ( 1 ) with @xmath9 and tried to visualize the 4d surfaces of section .",
    "this was an additional motivation for choosing the particular map to apply our visualization technique .",
    "furthermore studies accomplished by pfenniger [ 1985 ] , oll and pfenniger [ 1999 ] , jorba and oll [ 2004 ] , guarantee that hamiltonian hopf bifurcations are happening in this system .",
    "a study of a 4d symplectic map by means of gali indicators can be found in manos et al . [",
    "this allows us to compare also the behavior of the galactic type hamiltonian with that of the map at transitions from stability to complex instability .",
    "following pfenniger [ 1985 ] and jorba and oll [ 2004 ] , we examine the case with @xmath10 having as conjugated variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we also restrict the parameter space by taking @xmath13 .",
    "then , we rename @xmath14 as @xmath15 , and @xmath16 as @xmath17 .",
    "it is evident from the stability diagrams in pfenniger [ 1985 ] , that there is always a critical value @xmath18 , for @xmath19 , for which we have a transition from stability to complex instability . in order to include the case of such a transition in our calculations",
    ", we take here @xmath20 .",
    "we performed our calculations in double , as well as in quadruple precision and we found the same results , except in a case of simple instability ( see sect .  [ res ] below ) , where the results are only qualitatively similar . in that case",
    "we present the results found with quadruple precision .",
    "we studied the dynamics close to the fixed point ( 0,0,0,0 ) by varying @xmath15 . in the neighborhood of stable fixed points",
    "@xmath21 we find in the 4d phase space invariant tori .",
    "such invariant tori have been presented in projections already by froeschl [ 1972 ] . however , with the method of color and rotation we could verify that these tori are 4d objects .",
    "their 3d projections are of the kind called `` rotational tori '' by vrahatis et al . [",
    "their 4d representation , in all cases we examined , is in perfect agreement with the rotational invariant tori with smooth color variation on their surfaces found by katsanikas and patsis [ 2011 ] ( see their figure 13 ) . in fig .",
    "[ stab ] we give a typical example for @xmath22 .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath23 .",
    "we use the @xmath2 3d projection for the spatial representation of the consequents and @xmath3 to give the color that represents the fourth dimension . in this and in all subsequent figures the color bar on the right hand side gives the range of the color variation that corresponds to the normalized values of the fourth coordinate .",
    "even the change of the smooth color variation from the external to the internal side of the torus described by katsanikas and patsis [ 2011 ] in their study of the autonomous hamiltonian system is observed in the case of the rotational torus around the stable fixed point of the symplectic map .",
    "the detailed description of the color variation on the surface of the rotational torus should be sought in katsanikas and patsis [ 2011 ] .",
    "these structures characterize the dynamics of ordered behavior in the case of our map .",
    "calculating lyapunov characteristic numbers for all these orbits on the tori we find that they tend very fast to zero .     case .",
    "( a ) the characteristic toroidal figure associated with stability .",
    "the arrows indicate the regions where the smooth color variation changes from the external to the internal side of the torus .",
    "the point of view is @xmath24 ( b ) an enlargement of ( a ) at one of the transition regions of the color from the external ( `` _ _ ext _ _ '' ) to the internal ( `` _ _ int _ _ '' ) side of the torus ( cf . with figure 12 in katsanikas and patsis [ 2011 ] ) .",
    "we use less consequents in order to show how the structure of the colors varies .",
    "the point of view is now @xmath25 to show better how the color change side .",
    "]    simple instability is encountered for @xmath26 as the @xmath27 value increases .",
    "in the neighborhood of simple unstable ( 0,0,0,0 ) fixed points ( two eigenvalues on the unit circle and two on the real axis ) we find consequents defining a ribbon of the form of a double loop .",
    "this characteristic double loop structure is encountered only close to a critical value of the parameter ( the value of @xmath15 ) for which the stability of the fixed point changes and it becomes simple unstable .",
    "a typical example for @xmath28 and initial conditions @xmath29 is presented in fig .",
    "it gives the first @xmath30 consequents .",
    "such structures are associated with simple instability in 3d galactic potentials by patsis and zachilas [ 1994 ] and are extensively investigated by katsanikas et al .",
    "[ 2011c ] .",
    "the current situation resembles the dynamical behavior encountered in the neighborhood of simple unstable periodic orbits of the z - axis family in 3d rotating hamiltonian systems [ katsanikas et al .",
    "2011c ] , when we have a surface of section defined by @xmath31 .",
    "in the intersection of two branches of the double loop structure we have the same color , indicating that it belongs to the cases where the double loops correspond to a real 4d `` 8''-like structure .     case .",
    "we observe the characteristic double loop figure associated with simple instability .",
    "the point of view is @xmath32 . ]    after a large number of iterations the consequents depart from the surface of the ribbon - like object and build a cloud of points filling finally all available phase space .",
    "as @xmath27 increases the consequents leave the `` 8''-like structure faster . in the example of fig .",
    "[ u2 ] , @xmath33 and the initial conditions are as in the previous case .",
    "we observe that the consequents have left the `` 8''-like structure after @xmath34 iterations and start visiting larger volumes of the phase space ( fig .",
    "this is a case where we encountered quantitative differences when we use quadruple precision in our calculations .",
    "however , also in this case the results are qualitative the same .",
    "this behavior is depicted in the evolution of the `` finite time '' lyapunov characteristic number @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the distances of two nearby points at @xmath38 and after @xmath39 iterations [ see e.g. skokos 2010 ] .",

    "the index has an overall decreasing part that ends after about @xmath42 iterations ( when the consequents start departing from the 4d `` 8''-structure ) . then it increases and finally it levels off at a value about 0.355 .    the fixed point ( 0,0,0,0 )",
    "becomes double unstable for @xmath43 . in all cases",

    ", we find the disky structure ( confined torus ) that characterizes the dynamics close to complex unstable periodic orbits or fixed points .",

    "these `` disks '' have an internal spiral structure [ contopoulos et al .",

    "2,3,4 and 5 ) has been encountered in all cases of map ( 1 ) we have studied in this paper . in the present case",

    "we observe that @xmath40 levels off at a positive value about 0.009 , after an initial decreasing part . ]    also the behavior in the neighborhood of a complex unstable fixed point away from the critical @xmath55 value resembles that in the neighborhood of a complex unstable periodic orbit away from the jacobi constant value for which we have the transition from stability to complex instability .",
    "we have clouds of points with mixed colors . in the latter case the @xmath40 index reaches a positive value , larger than that of the confined torus case .",
    "the whole variation of the index remains in the cases we examined larger than the values we obtained for the disky structure for the same number of iterations .",
    "in this paper we compared the dynamical behavior in the neighborhood of fixed points in a 4d symplectic map and we compared the results with those found in the neighborhood of periodic orbits in a 3d autonomous hamiltonian system with a potential of galactic type . in our study",
    "we used the method of color and rotation .",
    "we found that the structures encountered in the spaces of section in the hamiltonian system , which characterize the kind of ( in)stability of the periodic orbits are also found characterizing the dynamics in the neighborhood of fixed points in the 4d symplectic map .",
    "these structures are : ( 1 ) the tori with the smooth color variation for stability , ( 2 ) the double loop ribbons with smooth color variation for the simple unstable case close to transitions from stability to simple instability , ( 3 ) the clouds of scattered points in the neighborhood of double unstable periodic orbits , and ( 4 ) the disky structures with smooth color variation close to a complex unstable fixed point near the transition from stability to complex instability .",
    "these results indicate that the 4d visualization of the surfaces of section in 3d autonomous hamiltonian systems and of the phase space in 4d symplectic maps associates the dynamics in the neighborhood of a fixed point , or a periodic orbit , with specific structures .",
    "we have not found any exception even in the case of the symplectic map we used in the present study .",
    "thus , these structures seem to reflect a generic behavior in a larger class of dynamical systems .",
    "our study also indicates that the color and rotation method allows us to know the kind of instability of the fixed point by a simple inspection of the 4d phase space and gives in a direct way an insight of the dynamics in such regions , not only in galactic type potentials , but in a broader spectrum of dynamical systems .",
