    "some time ago one of us ( slg ) noted @xcite that the @xmath0 boson mediating weak interactions can be resonantly produced in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath7 with a peak cross section @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the  elastic \" and total widths , respectively . at the time before the @xmath11 electroweak standard model was suggested only the combination @xmath12 was constrained by the fermi constant .",
    "now we know that @xmath13 so that the w resonance ( wr ) is at @xmath6 , the peak value of the cross section is @xmath14 , and the natural width is @xmath15 .",
    "the ultra high energy ( uhe ) @xmath4 required are rare , and the wr has not been seen yet . however , recent observations of  pev \" neutrinos in the ice - cube neutrino telescope @xcite at the south pole suggest that this may soon happen . indeed ,",
    "at its peak the wr cross section is @xmath16 times larger than the sum of all neutrino nucleon cross sections @xcite .",
    "the substantial ratio of the width to the energy of the resonance , @xmath17 , causes the wr to dominate the region at and around @xmath18 if a significant part of the incident neutrinos are of the @xmath4 flavor .    _ the origin of uhe neutrinos _",
    "uhe cosmic rays produce at the top of the atmosphere pions and kaons that decay into @xmath19 followed by @xmath20 , where the anti - neutrino typically carries about @xmath21 of the energy of the muon .",
    "however , these anti - neutrinos are unlikely to have energies as high as @xmath22 pions or muons with lorentz factors @xmath23 have decay lengths of @xmath24 or @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "only a negligible fraction of the pions , and a @xmath26 times smaller fraction of the muons ( which are the only source in this chain of the anti - neutrinos required for the wr ) would decay before interacting or hitting the ground .",
    "decay promptly before interacting and about @xmath27 of the decays have a final @xmath28 or @xmath29 . however , the rates of producing very energetic charmed mesons are too small to account for the observed flux .",
    "] indeed , the extensive analysis @xcite of the ice - cube collaboration using shower and muon vetoes excluded with high probability atmospheric neutrinos from being the main source of their events .",
    "neutrino mixing en - rout to earth generates a @xmath30 flavor mix consistent with the measured composition , which contains more  shower - like \" events due to non-@xmath31 neutrinos than  track events \" due to charged current interactions of @xmath32 and @xmath33 producing @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the roughly isotropic angular distribution of the events excludes cosmic rays interacting in the inter - stellar medium of our galaxy from being the main source , so that extra - galactic sources are left as the only likely astrophysical origin of most of the ice - cube neutrinos . if the source is indeed extra - galactic , the slowly falling @xmath36 observed spectrum of the uhe neutrinos follows , via feynman scaling of the @xmath37 collisions , from the @xmath36 spectrum of the protons which are accelerated a - la fermi . with the subsequent decay of the @xmath38 resonance at @xmath39 into @xmath40",
    "depends also on the photon spectrum so the origin of the @xmath41 spectrum here is less clear . ]",
    "the density of protons and/or photons in the vicinity of the accelerators could be such that the @xmath42 and/or the @xmath43 collisions can potentially yield the right flux for the ice - cube events .",
    "unless the pev neutrinos originate from the decay of a few pev dark matter particles in the galactic halo @xcite , or the accelerating  engine \" cuts off before @xmath18 , we expect the @xmath36 spectrum to continue beyond @xmath44 - the highest energy presently observed , and the wr should soon show up .",
    "the @xmath45 mass , width and branching ratios agree well with the standard ew model so that discovering the wr will not add to basic particle physics .",
    "however , along with nuclear interactions of uhe neutrinos , the wr will help diagnose the source of the uhe neutrinos @xcite , and is also a useful tool for deep earth geological research .",
    "_ interactions in the earth s crust or ice _    it has been suggested @xcite that o@xmath46 neutrino beams generated at accelerators could allow large scale earth crust / mantle tomography .",
    "the fact that the earth becomes almost opaque to the uhe neutrinos observed at ice - cube , implies that even whole earth tomography may become feasible once many uhe neutrino events with well measured directions and energies are available and the distribution of the incoming flux of neutrinos in the sky is known . because of the much shorter mean free path ( mfp ) @xmath47 of the @xmath6 wr neutrinos : @xmath48 in ice or in the earth s crust , they can probe much shorter distances . in the last equation",
    ", @xmath49 refers to the average electron number density along the path of the @xmath50 .",
    "measuring the wr neutrino flux arriving from many directions will then fix the integrated electron density along these directions .",
    "a point of key importance is that the linear treatment implicit in the last equation where  shadowing \" effects by higher layers are neglected , is inadequate when the paths traversed by the @xmath4 are comparable to @xmath51 as the actual flux of wr neutrinos reaching this depth is reduced relative to the original cosmological flux in this direction by absorption .",
    "using optical terminology we have here a  neutrino absorption line \" at @xmath52 .",
    "this line and in particular the effect of doppler broadening due to the motion of the atomic electrons is the focus of this note .",
    "_ motivation _    the cross section @xmath53 for producing the w resonance by an anti - neutrino of energy @xmath54 impinging on an electron at _ rest _ has the breit - wigner ( bw ) form : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is fixed by the natural @xmath45 width @xmath57",
    ". the expected rate of interactions @xmath58 would then be the product @xmath59 with @xmath60 the flux of anti - neutrinos at energy @xmath54 .",
    "since the cosmological flux @xmath61 is expected to vary only by a few percents over the resonance , measuring @xmath58 at various energies around @xmath18 would then yield the expected bw form of @xmath62 . as we will discuss in some detail ,",
    "the motion of atomic electrons broadens the effective @xmath62 curve .",
    "the effect which increases for heavier elements is moderate - amounting to about @xmath3 .",
    "originally @xcite this effect was estimated by using bohr s semi - classical model : @xmath63 , with @xmath64 the atomic charge and @xmath65 the principle quantum number of the electron in question .",
    "we improve on this by using the distribution of the velocities calculated by fourier transforming the various electron wave functions . as in most neutrino experiments ,",
    "we do not know a - priori what is the neutrino energy in each individual event and have to measure it by summing the energies of the particles produced in the event .",
    "the large distance between the strings carrying the photo - tubes in ice - cube , the large fraction of escaping energy in all leptonic decays due to the escaping neutrinos especially in @xmath66 where the escaping muons also carry much energy , and other possible effects generate a large experimental uncertainty in the measured energy @xmath54 exceeding the doppler broadening ( db ) .",
    "thus , it would seem that the db is , in the foreseeable future , of academic interest only .",
    "however , neutrino absorption suppresses the flux of neutrinos arriving at the detector after traversing distances comparable to their absorption length @xmath47 .",
    "this absorption is particularly relevant for energies near the peak of the bw curve where the mean free path is the shortest .",
    "thanks to the db we have the peak cross section suppressed by about @xmath67 , and the relevant penetration depth of the neutrinos will accordingly increase .",
    "note that this increase depends on the specific atomic composition along the neutrino path , which is predominantly that of oxygen in ice - cube experiments but has higher average @xmath64 in the earth s crust .",
    "this increase will manifest via @xmath68 , the _ total _ number of anti - neutrinos with energy @xmath18 which traversed a distance @xmath69 . note that to find this total number we need not measure the energy of each event .",
    "however , to find the distance traveled by the incident neutrino in the ice / crust we need to measure rather precisely directions of final state particles , which by kinematics follow very closely the direction of the initial incoming neutrino . measuring this direction is most straightforward in the @xmath70 of the wr events when we have an energetic muon in the final state : when the @xmath0 decays into @xmath19 or into @xmath71 or @xmath72 with the @xmath73 or @xmath74 quark decaying into a @xmath35 .",
    "_ computational details _",
    "we now present some details of the calculation of the db effect @xcite . consider a non - relativistic electron with 4-momentum @xmath75 and an anti - neutrino with 4-momentum @xmath76 .",
    "the part of the cm energy squared in the wr process that depends on @xmath54 is @xmath77 we substitute @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the electron s velocity , and keep only first order terms in @xmath80 .",
    "the scalar product in last term of ( [ cmenergy ] ) contributes a factor of @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the angle between the electron and the anti - neutrino velocities .",
    "thus , the bw curve is modified by replacing @xmath54 with @xmath83 so that : @xmath84\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is velocity distribution of the target electrons . the angular integration over @xmath86 and @xmath87 yields : @xmath88\\ ] ] in particular , the ratio of cross sections at @xmath89 is @xmath90 to calculate @xmath85 in multi - electron atoms",
    ", we fourier transform the electron s wave function and find the velocity distribution function for the i - th electron : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the i - th electron wave function in momentum space . averaging over the @xmath64 electrons in the atom we obtain : @xmath93 according to @xcite the wave functions can be well approximated by the simple form : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the bohr radius , and @xmath96 for the ( n , l ) orbital is @xmath97 where @xmath98 represents the effect of screening of the nuclear charge by the other electrons .",
    "define @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "some relevant values of @xmath101 are given in the following table    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     .",
    ", height=529 ]    one interesting consequence of the above calculation is that @xmath47 of the neutrinos does not depend _ only _ on the integrated number of electrons along its path , but thanks to the db effect , also on the composition of the layers traversed by it .",
    "specifically , going to higher @xmath64 materials ( which generally also have higher densities ) will decrease @xmath47 more slowly then just in proportion to the electron number density @xmath49 .",
    "unfortunately , it is very hard to test this in ice - cube where almost all horizontal long paths with zenith angles approaching @xmath102 degrees are completely within the ice , and paths with zenith angles slightly larger than @xmath102 degrees , namely from just under the horizon , are much longer than @xmath103 , which is the mean free path in the ice .",
    "in this short note we have presented a calculation of the doppler broadening of the @xmath0 resonance produced in collisions of uhe electron anti - neutrinos and atomic electrons . due to substantial experimental errors in determining the energy of each individual neutrino event , measuring the number of neutrino interactions at any given",
    "energy around the resonance is unlikely to reveal the @xmath3 extra broadening - beyond the natural width effect .",
    "however , measuring the direction from which the neutrino came can fix the length of path in the ice ( or in some future set - ups in rocks as well ) which the neutrino had to traverse to reach the interaction point .",
    "the ensuing @xmath3 reduction of the peak cross - section and corresponding prolongation of @xmath47 may have a measurable impact , and as such may be of interest in geological applications .",
