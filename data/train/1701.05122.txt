    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , the most spectacular phenomena occurring on the sun , often consist of abundant structures comprising plasma and magnetic fields that are expelled from the sun into * the * interplanetary space . if two cmes erupt closely in time from the same active region ( ar ) , they are called as  twin - cmes \" . according to gopalswamy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and li et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , this kind of  twin - cme \" event may facilitate the particle acceleration in the solar atmosphere and in the interplanetary space .",
    "it is suggested that if the preceding cme drives a shock and creates an environment of enhanced level of turbulence and energetic particles , the following cme with its associated separate shock may propagate into this environment , leading to a more efficient shock acceleration process ( see also , li & zank 2005 ; ding et al .",
    "2013 , 2014 ) .",
    "hence , twin cmes , representative of a special agent capable of efficient particle acceleration , are crucial in both solar physics studies and space weather forecasting .",
    "however , the physical origin and eruption mechanism of twin cmes remain elusive .",
    "it is widely accepted that filament eruptions are closely associated with solar flares and cmes ( low 1996 ; chen 2011 ; schmieder et al .",
    "2013 ) , and the three eruptive phenomena are different manifestations of a single process ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "there are many models for the eruption mechanisms , such as the tether - cutting reconnection ( moore et al .",
    "2001 ) , the breakout reconnection ( antiochos et al . 1999 ; chen et al . 2016 ) , the helical kink instability ( fan 2005 ) , and the torus instability ( kliem & trk 2006 ; aulanier et al . 2010 ) . in the scenario of the common pattern of filament eruptions ( sterling & moore 2004 )",
    ", the filament gradually ascends in an initial slow - rise phase , followed by a sharp change to a fast - acceleration phase .",
    "in addition to successful eruptions , there also exist failed / confined eruptions ( ji et al .",
    "2003 ; liu et al . 2009 ; guo et al . 2010 ; joshi et al .",
    "2013 ; song et al . 2014",
    "; dalmasse et al .",
    "2014 ) , and partial eruptions ( gilbert et al . 2007 ; liu et al . 2007 ; shen et al .",
    "2012 ; zhang et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "based on three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations for twisted flux tubes under convective zone conditions , linton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found four fundamental types of flux - tube interactions : bounce , merging , slingshot , and tunnel .",
    "they also proposed that the merging interaction has significant reconnection involving mostly the azimuthal fields , and the two interacting flux tubes merge into one after the interaction .",
    "filaments are believed to embed in the magnetic configurations of filament channels or flux ropes ( aulanier et al .",
    "2002 ; liu et al .",
    "2012 ) , and the merging interactions can occur between filaments along one common filament channel or along different filament channels ( martin et al . 1994 ; schmieder et al . 2004 ; devore et al . 2005 ; aulanier et al . 2006 ; su et al .",

    "the newly - formed filament can eventually erupt , if it is destabilized by further magnetic cancellation at the footpoints ( litvinenko & martin 1999 ; martens & zwaan 2001 ; devore et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in this study",
    ", we present the observations of the interaction between two filaments in a same filament channel associated with twin cmes , by using high - quality data from the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia : lemen et al .",
    "2012 ) onboard the _ solar dynamics observatory ( sdo _ : pesnell et al .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 describe the observations used in the work ; the main results are presented in section 3 ; we give the conclusions and discussion in section 4 .",
    "the filament eruption occurred at the noaa ar 12486 on 2016 january 26 , accompanying with a c1.3 flare . to study the filament evolution",
    ", we utilise the observations from sdo / aia combining the h@xmath0 filtergrams from the global oscillation network group ( gong ) of the national solar observatory . the aia observes the full disk ( 4096  @xmath1 4096 pixels ) of the sun and up to 0.5 @xmath2 above the limb in ten euv and uv wavelengths , with a pixel resolution of 0@xmath36 and a cadence of 12 s. the h@xmath0 images are at 6563   with a spatial resolution of 1@xmath4 and a cadence of @xmath51 minute ( harvey et al .",
    "magnetograms from the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi : scherrer et al .",
    "2012 ) , with a cadence of 45 s and pixel scale of 0@xmath36 , are used to check the magnetic field evolution of the source region .",
    "the evolution of cmes in the high corona is detected by the large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ; brueckner et al .",
    "1995 ) c2 .",
    "the kinematics of the filament and associated moving plasma are analyzed with the time - slice approach .",
    "the speeds are determined by linear fits , with the measurement uncertainty taken to be 4 pixel ( @xmath51.74 mm ) for aia data .",
    "we also use the potential field source surface ( pfss ; schrijver & de rosa 2003 ) model to extrapolate the large - scale magnetic field topology in the corona .",
    "figure 1 shows the magnetic filed evolution of ar 12486 in hmi magnetograms .",
    "the decaying ar consists of a leading positive polarity and a following negative polarity .",
    "the magnetic polarities are dispersed , and the long polarities inversion line ( pil ) has less shear .",
    "most of the opposite magnetic polarities along the pil are disconnected .",
    "the polarities along the southern part of the pil are diffuse and weak , and that along the northern part of the pil are closer and stronger ( panel a ) .",
    "there exists obvious cancellation and emergence of magnetic flux along the pil ( see the attached animation ) , and we focus on the magnetic field on both sides of the northern part of the pil .",
    "there are some magnetic cancellation sites , where the opposite polarities are approaching and colliding with each other ( white boxes in panels b - h ) . between the unconnected opposite magnetic polarities , some magnetic flux emerged in the form of small patches or spots ( cyan arrows in panels d - f ) , followed by quick cancellations . in the plot of the total flux change ( panel i ) for the magnetic field in the northern of ar ( the box in panel a ) , for both the positive and negative fluxes",
    ", there has a trend of decreasing since @xmath508:00 ut ( the left vertical line ) , and it is very clear for the abrupt cancellation and rapid emergence just before the eruption ( the right vertical line and arrows in panel i ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the filament evolution ( see the attached animations ) in composite warm passbands ( aia 171 , 193 , and 211   ; panels a , d , and g ) and in aia 304   ( panels b - c , e - f , and h - i ) . in 304   , two filament systems , the west filament ( f1 ) and the east filament ( f2 ; white arrows ) , located in the same long filament channel . f1 and",
    "its overlying magnetic arcades are shown in details in the right - down corner , and the cool material of magnetic arcades condensed in shallow dips along magnetic field lines ( panels a - b ) .",
    "note that a polar coronal hole ( ch ; yellow arrows ) is southeast to the ar .",
    "likely due to the magnetic activities , the filament system * was * activated , and there appeared some brightenings around the east footpoints ( b1 and b2 ) of f1 and the magnetic arcades , which made f1 and the magnetic arcades more obvious .",
    "on the other hand , the dark f2 was clearly seen to underlie f1 and magnetic arcades , and b1-b2 both located closely in the north to the western part of f2 ( white arrows in panels c - e ) . after the activation , f1 and the magnetic arcades rose slowly , and f1 was heated to become brighter than the cooler magnetic arcades ( panel f ) . at @xmath517:25",
    "ut , the heated f1 began to erupt southward , and two flare ribbons appeared at the center of the filament channel ( black arrows in panels h - i ) .",
    "interestingly , the brightened b1 moved southeastward along the filament channel , while b2 was nearly fixed during the eruption ( b1 and b2 in panels c - i ) .",
    "moreover , it seemed to be disconnected between the top of f1 and b1 ( green arrows ) during the eruption , and some bright plasma ( blue arrows ) moved from the intersection of f1 and f2 toward the far east end of the filament channel ( panels h - i ) .",
    "figure 3 displays the filament activities in h@xmath0 filtergrams .",
    "superposed with the hmi magnetogram , f1 and f2 were clearly located along the pil , and the filament center was wide ( panel a ) . before the eruption , f1 and its magnetic arcades were already highly activated , which was especially obvious in the middle wide part ( see the attached animation ) . at @xmath516:34",
    "ut , b1 clearly coincided with the west footpoints of f2 ( the southwestward green arrow ) , and some portions of f2 were undetectable , due to the low opacity ( panel b ) .",
    "after the activation , f1 was heated in a higher temperature and became invisible in h@xmath0 , and the magnetic arcades ( pink arrows ) began to lift up , resulted in some enhanced brightenings ( red arrows ) around their west footpoints , while f2 ( white arrows ) became thin and faint ( panels c - d ) .",
    "at @xmath517:22 ut , the magnetic arcades began to be disrupted with cracks in their tops ( northward pink arrows in panels e - h ) , as a result of being pushed by the erupting f1 . during the eruption , b2 barely moved , but b1 slipped southeastward ( b1 and b2 in panels e - i ) . as a result of the eruption , flare ribbons ( black arrows ) and some mass flow ( blue arrows )",
    "are also distinct ( panels f - i ) .",
    "the bright plasma came from the intersection of f1 and f2 , and became dark during its eastward motion over f2 ( panel i ) .",
    "followed with the mass flow , the western part of f2 disappeared , and the eastern portions of f2 were mostly at rest ( white arrows in panels h - i ) .      the erupting f1 and",
    "the expanding magnetic arcades are clearly seen in other aia passbands ( panels a - b of figure 4 ) .",
    "in addition , it is also clear for the moving plasma extending eastward to the far end of the filament channel ( blue arrows ) , and the post - eruption loops ( the yellow arrow ) appeared earlier in aia hot passbands than that in warm passbands ( panels d - e ) . the evolution of the eruption is better seen in aia 171 and in 304   running - difference images ( panels c and f - g ) .",
    "the impulsive f1 ran fast southeastward , and magnetic arcades were pushed to ascend , with overlying loops expanding as a faint rim ( white arrows in panel c ) .",
    "f1 kept moving southeastward , and separated clearly from magnetic arcades ( arrows in panels f - g ) .",
    "note that the erupting f1 seems to connect with the east end of the long filament channel .",
    "the evolution in two different directions ( s1 and s2 in panel f ) is clearly shown in time - slice plots ( panels g - h ) .",
    "it is obvious that f1 and magnetic arcades both rose slowly in a few tens km s@xmath6 ( black arrows ) in the pre - eruption phase from @xmath517:25 ut ( dashed vertical lines ) . along southwestward s1 , magnetic arcades impulsively expanded at a speed of @xmath5139.7 km s@xmath6 ( pink arrow ) , and f1 rose very slowly ( green arrow ) . along southeastward s2 ,",
    "the expanding magnetic arcades was faint , but f1 began to accelerate after the eruption and finally ceased at the boundary of the ch at @xmath517:50 ut ( the red arrow ) . before its halt , f1 first accelerated to @xmath5108.6 km s@xmath6 , and then obtained a faster speed of @xmath5305.6 km s@xmath6 ( the green arrows ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the evolution of the three eruptive parts in aia 304 and 171   images ( left and middle panels ) , and in time - slice plots ( right panels ) .",
    "the rising magnetic arcades ( the pink arrow ) had a westward drift from 18:10 to 18:50 ut ( panels a - b ; see the attached animation ) , with a speed of @xmath5211.5 km s@xmath6 ( panel c ) .",
    "after the encounter with the ch , the impulsive f1 was forced to move along the open field line of the ch , in the form of the moving bright feature ( the green arrow in panel e ) .",
    "the f1 has a velocity of @xmath5179.5 km s@xmath6 ( panel f ) .",
    "note that there appeared brightenings and dimmings at the footpoints of the ch ( cyan arrows in panels a - b and d - f ) , which likely indicates the interaction between the erupting f1 and the ch .",
    "moreover , the moving plasma ( the blue arrow ) induced a longitudinal oscillation of f2 ( the white arrow ) in the same filament channel ( panel g ) . in the time - slice plot ( panel i ) , the oscillation clearly started after the arrival of the moving plasma that had an injection speed of @xmath5165.1 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the initial speed of the oscillation is @xmath547.3 km s@xmath6 ( the red arrow ) , and the oscillation period is @xmath555 minutes , estimated by the first two peaks ( dotted lines ) , which is similar to the results of zhang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .      following the eruption",
    ", there appeared a pair of ( i.e. , the twins ) cmes in the field of view ( fov ) of lasco c2 ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the first cme ( cme1 ) appeared at 18:24 ut with a bright front ( panel a ) , developing into a wider cme structure .",
    "the second cme ( cme2 ) emerged later from the south end of cme1 with a narrow front ( red arrow in panel b ) .",
    "the central position angles of the twin cmes are 244@xmath7 and 209@xmath7 , respectively , and their median speeds are 297 km s@xmath6 and 134 km s@xmath6 , respectively . the close correlations in time , location , and velocity , demonstrate that the twin cmes are closely associated with the filament eruption .",
    "it is likely that cme1 and cme2 came from magnetic arcades and f1 , respectively .",
    "both cmes did not extend eastward during the expansion , due to the limit of the ch magnetic field .",
    "cme2 seemed to move along the south boundary of cme1 in a narrow extent , which is consistent with the moving bright feature along the open filed line in figure 5 .",
    "after examining the pfss results of the ch magnetic field lines ( panel e ) , we see that the ch open field lines are of negative polarity lying next to the ar .",
    "the open field lines at the ch - ar boundary , with the non - radial expansion , occupy the space above the ar .",
    "this magnetic configuration helps understand the drift of rising magnetic arcades , and how the eruptive f1 ran into field lines of the ch , and then was forced to move outward in the form of cme2 along the specific trajectory .",
    "here we study a very interesting filament eruption associate with two filaments ( f1 and f2 ) in a same filament channel .",
    "the evolutionary details of the event are listed in table 1 .",
    "the ascent of f1 was likely triggered by a sequence of rapid cancellation and emergence , supported by their intimate spatial - temporal correlation .",
    "the interaction of f1 and f2 is evidenced by the east footpoints of f1 slipping toward the east far end of the filament channel and post - eruption loops straddling the intersection of two filaments . due to the bright moving plasma and the longitudinal filament oscillation in the eastern part ( involving f2 ) of the filament channel , we suggest that the interaction likely occurs between f1 and the part ( higher ) magnetic field overlying f2 , which makes f2 nearly stayed at rest during the eruption .",
    "the brightenings and dimmings at the ch boundary indicate the collision of the erupting f1 and the nearby ch . according to the close temporal - spatial correlation and the large - scale ch - ar magnetic field configuration given by pfss , we suggest that the magnetic arcades were pushed to erupt as the first cme ( cme1 ) , and the erupting f1 finally evolved into the second cme ( cme2 ) after the interaction with f2 and the collision with the ch .",
    "cccc 11:00 - 16:30 ut & f1 and magnetic arcades were destabilised , and became wider .",
    "+ 16:34 ut & the east footpoints ( b1 ) of f1 were very close to the west footpoints of f2 .",
    "+ 17:00 ut & f1 and magnetic arcades started to lift slowly , and f2 was nearly at rest .",
    "+ & brightenings appeared at b1 and b2 .",
    "+ 17:08 - 17:22 ut & b1 moved southeastward , and b2 was always fixed .",
    "+ 17:25 ut & f1 impulsively erupted southeastward , and pushed magnetic arcades to expand .",
    "+ & flare ribbons and bright plasma flow were detected .",
    "+ 17:25 - 17:44 ut & the western part of f2 became invisible .",
    "+ & the eastern portions of f2 survived .",
    "+ 17:54 ut & the erupting f1 began to decelerate .",
    "+ & some brightenings and dimmings appeared at the ch boundary .",
    "+ 18:00 ut & f1 propagated in a form of bright blob , and some dark material of magnetic arcades drifted westward .",
    "+ & there appeared a filament longitudinal oscillation in the filament channel of f2 .",
    "+ 18:24 ut & the first cme ( cme1 ) appeared in the fov of lasco / c2 .",
    "+ 19:24 ut & the second cme ( cme2 ) appeared in the fov of lasco / c2 .",
    "+    based on the observations and the assumed magnetic filed overlying f2 , we propose one possible interpretation in the schematic representation in figure 7 .",
    "viewing f1 ( green ) and f2 ( long cyan ) from the positive - polarity side , their axial field points to the left ( panel a ) .",
    "hence , f1 and f2 both reveals sinistral chirality and the parallel axial fields , in accordance with the general hemispheric rule for the south hemisphere ( martin et al .",
    "1994 ; zirker et al . 1997 ; pevtsov et al .",
    "2003 ) . due to the southward motion , the axial field of the eastern part of f1 intersects the presumed higher field lines ( orange lines ) overlying f2 at an acute angle ( black arrows in panels b - c ) , which is suitable for the merging reconnection ( linton et al .",
    "2001 ) . following the continuous southward motion of the eruptive f1",
    ", the reconnection sites also shift along the axis of f2 at their contact points ( panel c ) , and the east footpoints ( b1 ) of f1 also slipped along the east footpoints ( d1-d2 ) of higher field lines overlying f2 .",
    "finally , f1 and the part of f2 merge into a new longer filament structure ( the red f in panels c - d ) , and magnetic arcades were pushed to expand with the fixed east footpoints ( b2 ) . moreover , the merging reconnection likely only occurred between the erupting f1 and the overlying higher field lines of f2 , and the overlying lower field lines ( blue lines ) made f2 be confined .",
    "hence , the partial merging reconnection results in that most of f2 ( short cyan in panels c - d ) keep intact , and some bright plasma moves along the lower field lines ( blue lines with white arrows ) of f2 . for the disappearance of the western part of f2 close to the flare ribbons , it is possible due to the mass transfer of the plasma flow or due to the heating process during the eruption .",
    "intriguingly , the eruption involved a twin - cme eruption . in the twin - cme scenario proposed by li et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , two cmes originate from two eruptions , and take off closely in time from the same ar . here",
    ", the twin cmes formed due to the two erupting branches in different propagation directions .",
    "cme1 came from the expanding of overlying magnetic arcades driven by the impulsive f1/f .",
    "cme2 evolved from the impulsive f1 after the collision at the boundary of a nearby ch .",
    "the change of propagation direction of f1 and the westward material drift of the magnetic arcades ( fig.5a - c and the yellow arrow in fig.7d ) show the importance of large - scale magnetic topology of the ch to define the eventual propagating directions of eruptions ( see also zheng et al .",
