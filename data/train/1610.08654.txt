    "central configurations are an important class of solutions in @xmath0-body problems .",
    "they lead directly to homographic motions , where the initial shape of the configuration is preserved throughout the orbit , and play an important role in the study of the topology of the integral manifolds . in applied settings ,",
    "central configurations have proved useful for designing low - cost low - energy space missions  @xcite and have been discerned in numerical simulations of the eyewall in hurricanes  @xcite .    locating a central configuration involves solving a challenging set of nonlinear algebraic equations .",
    "one approach to making the problem more tractable is to impose a geometric constraint on the shape of the configuration . in  @xcite ,",
    "roberts and cors investigated four - body co - circular central configurations , where the bodies are assumed to lie on a common circle .",
    "other constraints employed involve symmetry , such as assuming the configuration has an axis of symmetry  @xcite , or that it consists of nested regular @xmath0-gons  @xcite .",
    "recently , li , deng and zhang have shown that the diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid central configuration are not perpendicular  @xcite .",
    "we extend this result further by proving that the _ only _ four - body convex central configurations with perpendicular diagonals are the kite configurations ( symmetric with respect to a diagonal ) . here , `` convex '' means that no body is contained in the convex hull of the other three bodies .",
    "we prove this result for general power - law potential functions as well as for the planar four - vortex problem .",
    "it is hoped that the techniques described in this paper will prove fruitful for tackling similar open problems in celestial mechanics  @xcite .",
    "we begin by deriving an important equation for four - body central configurations involving mutual distances .",
    "good references for this material are schmidt  @xcite , hampton , roberts , and santoprete  @xcite ( for the vortex case ) , and the recent book chapter by moeckel  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the position and mass , respectively , of the @xmath3-th body .",
    "except for the case of @xmath0 point vortices , we will assume that the masses are positive .",
    "denote @xmath4 as the distance between the @xmath3-th and @xmath5-th bodies .",
    "if @xmath6 denotes the sum of the masses , then the _ center of mass _ is given by @xmath7 .",
    "the motion of the bodies is governed by the potential function @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a parameter .",
    "the classical @xmath0-body problem corresponds to @xmath10 .",
    "the _ moment of inertia _ with respect to the center of mass , which measures the relative size of the configuration , is given by @xmath11    there are many equivalent ways of describing a central configuration .",
    "we follow the topological approach .",
    "let @xmath12 be some positive constant .    a planar _ central configuration _",
    "@xmath13 is a critical point of @xmath14 subject to the constraint @xmath15 .",
    "it is important to note that , due to the invariance of @xmath14 and @xmath16 under isometries , any rotation , translation , or scaling of a central configuration still results in a central configuration .",
    "we now restrict to central configurations in the planar four - body problem .",
    "a configuration is _ convex _ if no body lies inside or on the convex hull of the other three bodies ( e.g. , a rhombus or a trapezoid ) ; otherwise , it is _ concave_. a _ kite _",
    "configuration contains two bodies on an axis of symmetry and two bodies located symmetrically with respect to this axis ( see figure  [ fig : kites ] ) .",
    "the diagonals of a convex kite configuration are perpendicular .",
    "the main result of this paper is to prove that kite configurations are the only central configurations with this property .",
    "if the diagonals of a four - body convex central configuration are perpendicular , then the configuration must be a kite .",
    "[ mainthm ]    for four bodies , the six mutual distances @xmath17 are excellent coordinates .",
    "these distances describe an actual configuration in the plane if the cayley - menger determinant , defined as @xmath18 vanishes and the triangle inequality @xmath19 holds for any choice of indices with @xmath20 .",
    "we must impose the constraint @xmath21 to find planar central configurations ; otherwise , the only critical points of @xmath14 restricted to @xmath15 are regular tetrahedra .",
    "thus , we seek critical points of the function @xmath22 satisfying @xmath15 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are lagrange multipliers .",
    "let @xmath26 be the oriented area of the triangle whose vertices contain all bodies except for the @xmath3-th body .",
    "assuming the bodies in a convex quadrilateral are ordered sequentially , we have @xmath27 and @xmath28 . an important formula involving the cayley - menger determinant is @xmath29 formula  ( [ eq : cayley - deriv ] ) is only valid when restricting to planar configurations .",
    "differentiating function  ( [ eq : cps ] ) with respect to @xmath30 and applying formula  ( [ eq : cayley - deriv ] ) yields @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "group the six equations defined by  ( [ eq : cc ] ) as follows : @xmath34 multiplying the equations together pairwise and cancelling the common terms yields the well - known dziobek relation @xmath35 finally , after eliminating @xmath36 from equation  ( [ equs : dzio ] ) , we obtain the important relation @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : consist ] ) is a necessary condition for a four - body planar central configuration .",
    "assuming that @xmath23 , it is also sufficient , although further restrictions are needed to ensure that the masses are positive . for a convex configuration , the two diagonals must each be strictly longer than any of the exterior sides .",
    "for instance , if the bodies are ordered sequentially , then we have @xmath39 . moreover , the shortest and longest exterior sides must lie opposite each other ( with equality only in the case of the square ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath40 is the length of the longest exterior side , then @xmath41 . these geometric relations can be derived by dividing different pairs of equations in  ( [ eq : ccgroup ] ) and using the convexity of the configuration ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "without loss of generality , we can assume that the bodies in the convex central configuration are ordered sequentially in a counterclockwise fashion around the configuration .",
    "thus , the lengths of the diagonals are @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and these are larger than any of the four exterior sides @xmath44 .",
    "we can also assume that the bodies are labeled so that @xmath40 is the longest exterior side .",
    "since the diagonals are perpendicular , we can apply a rotation and translation to place the bodies on the coordinate axes .",
    "finally , by scaling the configuration , we can assume that @xmath45 .",
    "let the other positions be given by @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 are positive real variables ( see figure  [ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "in these coordinates kite configurations occur in two distinct cases : @xmath49 ( horizontal axis of symmetry ; left plot in figure  [ fig : kites ] ) , or @xmath50 ( vertical axis of symmetry ; right plot in figure  [ fig : kites ] ) . if both @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the configuration is a rhombus .",

    "since @xmath40 is the length of the longest exterior side , we have @xmath54 , which implies @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    denote @xmath57 as the function @xmath58 where each mutual distance is treated as a function of the variables @xmath48 .",

    "since @xmath57 is a differentiable function , it follows that there can be only one solution to @xmath70 , and this must be @xmath50 .",
