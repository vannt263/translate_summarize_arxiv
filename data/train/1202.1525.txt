    "massive stars reach the wolf - rayet ( wr ) evolutionary phase when their hydrogen fuel has been consumed or lost and the products of nuclear fusion appear in their atmospheres , before ending their short lives among the progenitors of core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) @xcite .",
    "these stars are millions of times more luminous than the sun and drive strong stellar winds by radiation pressure exerted through absorption and scattering in spectral lines @xcite .",
    "this `` line - driving '' mechanism is known to be unstable @xcite and is thought to create hydrodynamic shocks that heat the plasma to a few million degrees with the emission of thermal x - rays @xcite . for o - type stars , which have weaker winds than wr stars , this model is largely consistent with the observations @xcite .",
    "the winds of wr stars are also expected to suffer from the line - driving instability ( ldi ) @xcite and thus may emit x - rays similar to the o - type stars .",
    "this conjecture was not verified by observations so far .    in this _",
    "letter _ we report the first high - resolution x - ray spectrum of a putatively single wn - type star and its analysis .",
    "the object of our study , wr6 ( ezcma , hd50896 ) , has been successfully modeled as a hydrogen - free wn star of subtype wn5 by fitting its uv , visible , and infrared spectra @xcite .",
    "its stellar temperature is 90kk , and its luminosity is @xmath1 when adopting a distance of 1.82kpc as implied from its membership to the association collinder121 .",
    "the mass - loss rate is @xmath2yr@xmath3 , and the wind reaches a terminal velocity of @xmath4kms@xmath3 . hence the wind carries a mechanical power @xmath5 equivalent to @xmath6 , which is about 3% of the stellar luminosity .",
    "the wr winds are strongly inhomogeneous @xcite .",
    "narrow spectral features drifting over the broad emission - line profiles are interpreted as showing radially accelerated blobs of matter @xcite .",
    "quasi - periodic variability could be related to rotation @xcite and caused by spiral - like density patterns in the wind rooted in the photosphere , similar to the corotating interaction regions observed in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "wr6 shows considerable photometric , spectral , and polarimetric variability on the time scale of 3.766d @xcite .",
    "its thermal radio spectrum @xcite and complex variability pattern @xcite support the conclusion that wr6 is not a binary but a single star .",
    "previous x - ray observations of wr6 at lower spectral resolution confirmed that its x - ray luminosity and temperature are typical of single wn stars @xcite .",
    "the x - ray data on wr6 were taken with the x - ray multi - mirror satellite xmm-_newton_. its telescopes illuminate three different instruments which always operate simultaneously : rgs is a reflection grating spectrometer , achieving a spectral resolution of 0.07 ; rgs is not sensitive for wavelengths shorter than 5 .",
    "the other focal instruments mos and pn cover the shorter wavelengths ; their spectral resolution is modest ( @xmath720  50 ) .",
    "the data were obtained at four epochs in 2010 ( oct.11 and 13 , nov.4 and 6 ) .",
    "the total exposure time of 400 kilosecond was split into four individual parts .",
    "our data reduction involved standard procedures of the xmm-_newton _  science analysis system v.10.0 .",
    "the rgs spectrum is shown in fig.[fig : rgs4 ] .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of wr6 in the 0.3  12.0kev band is @xmath8ergs@xmath3 , or @xmath9 .",
    "this constitutes @xmath10 of the wind s mechanical power .",
    "the rgs spectrum is dominated by strong and broad emission lines of metals in accordance with the wn - wind abundances characteristic of cno processed material .    to model the observed x - ray spectrum we generated emissivities for a hydrogen - free plasma with the apec thermal plasma model @xcite . for most elements",
    "the abundances were fixed to the values derived from the uv and optical spectra .    in this stage",
    "we approximate the line profiles by gaussians , with a common doppler shift against the laboratory wavelength of @xmath11 and a width ( fwhm ) of @xmath12 as the best values found by the automatic procedure from fitting the rgs data .",
    "the optimum fits to the observed spectra were obtained with the isis software @xcite .",
    "the observed spectra , the best - fitting model , and the residuals are shown in fig.[fig : specmodels ] . in order to achieve an acceptable fit",
    ", it was necessary to compose the emission from plasmas of three different temperatures ( 1.6 , 7.0 and 45mk ) with respective emission measures of 253 , 86 , and 22 @xmath13 .",
    "the hottest component is required to reproduce the 25@xmath14  continuum and the emission lines from fe  , ca  , ar  , and s  . nevertheless , there are still residuals at some lines , such as mg   and ne  , indicating that a three - temperature model is not fully sufficient , or that some abundances are not well determined .",
    "o and c lines are absent or very weak , as expected for a plasma with the chemical composition of a wn - type wind .    to account for the absorption within the wind we applied the _ vphabs _ model @xcite , modified for the absence of hydrogen .",
    "strong absorption , significantly exceeding that of the interstellar medium towards the star , is evident .",
    "the ratio of fluxes in the nvi and nvii ly@xmath15 lines is reproduced when absorption in the cool wind is included , especially the k - shell ionization edge of niv that is located between the two aforementioned lines ( see fig[fig : specmodels ] ) .",
    "the low - resolution epic spectra provide data up to 12kev .",
    "significant residuals are encountered in the region around the fe   line at about 1.9   ( see fig.[fig : specmodels ] ) .",
    "the observation shows a definitely broader feature than reproduced by the plasma model .",
    "obviously , this complex includes a further blend .",
    "the fit of an additional gaussian profile yields a flux of @xmath16 and a line center at 1.92 .",
    "the latter value agrees within the uncertainties with the wavelength of the fe  k@xmath15 line ( 1.94 ) .",
    "hence we conclude that cool - wind material must be irradiated by x - rays which are hard enough ( @xmath17kev ) to excite this line by fluorescence .",
    "our powr wind models show that in the outer wind the leading ionization stage of iron is fev .",
    "the presence of fluorescence is consistent with a two - component medium , where the cool wind is permeated with the hot x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "to determine the physical conditions in the `` cool '' component of the stellar wind , we employ the powr model atmosphere code @xcite .",
    "the powr code solves the non - lte radiative transfer simultaneously with the equations of statistical and radiative equilibrium .",
    "complex model atoms with thousands of transitions are taken into account .",
    "the extensive inclusion of the iron group elements is important because of their blanketing effect on the atmospheric structure @xcite .",
    "a particular stellar atmosphere model is defined by the effective temperature , surface gravity , luminosity , mass - loss rate , wind terminal velocity , and chemical composition .",
    "for the supersonic part of the wind , we adopt the radial dependence of velocity as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is in units of the stellar radius @xmath20 , and the terminal velocity @xmath21 is a free parameter . in the subsonic region , the velocity field",
    "is defined such that the hydrostatic density stratification is approached .",
    "the powr models account for stellar - wind clumping in the standard volume - filling factor ` microclumping ' approximation @xcite .",
    "our best model of wr6 has a clumping factor @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "the synthetic spectra are calculated over the whole spectral range from uv to ir , and then compared to the observed spectra and photometric fluxes .    with the final wind model",
    "being adopted , the stratifications of the density , opacity , ionization , and radiative flux are defined .",
    "the mass absorption increases with distance from the star , partly because the fully ionized helium recombines to he   with its strong bound - free opacity .",
    "this increase of the mass absorption coefficient partly compensates for the decrease of matter density , keeping the wind opaque to large radii .    in fig.[fig :",
    "tau1 ] ( upper panel ) we show the radius in the wind where the continuum optical depth on the radial ray becomes unity , as predicted by powr model .",
    "roughly speaking , only x - rays emitted from outside that radius can escape from the wind and be seen by a distant observer , unless inhomogeneities create some porosity ( `` macroclumping '' ) .",
    "helium - like ions show a group of three lines , consisting of a forbidden ( @xmath24 ) , an intercombination ( @xmath25 ) , and a resonance ( r ) transition  the so - called @xmath26 triplet . the @xmath26 triplets of si  , mg  , ne  , and n   are present in the rgs spectrum of wr6 . as illustrated in fig.[fig : nvi ] , the line ratios observed in wr6 are very different from those observed in typical single o - type stars . for nvi",
    "the ratio @xmath27 exceeds unity in wr6 , while o stars show @xmath28 @xcite .    for each he - like ion , the ratio of fluxes between the forbidden and the intercombination component , @xmath29 , is sensitive to the electron density and the ultraviolet flux @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the photoexcitation rate from the term 2s@xmath32s to 2p@xmath32p , and @xmath33 is the electron density .",
    "the quantities @xmath34 , and @xmath35 depend only on atomic parameters and the electron temperature @xcite .",
    "we use the powr model to calculate the values of @xmath36 for mg  , ne  , and n   as function of the radial location in the wind of wr6 . the density in the x - ray emitting shocks",
    "is not known , therefore we computed two sets of @xmath36 , one neglecting the density term , and another one assuming that the density in the shock is the same as in the ambient `` cool '' wind but the plasma is fully ionized . according to the strong - shock condition , the hot gas density would be even a factor of four higher than that @xcite .",
    "the photo - excitation rates @xmath37 are computed at each radius from the radiation intensity as provided by the powr model , which accounts not only simply for geometric dilution , but also for the diffuse radiative field .",
    "the model shows that radiative depopulation of the metastable level dominates over collisional depopulation .",
    "fig.[fig : tau1 ] ( low panel ) shows for the nvi triplet the predicted @xmath29 ratio as function of the radial location of the emitting plasma .",
    "the measured @xmath38 ratio for the nvi is only compatible with the model if the x - ray emitting plasma is more than @xmath39 away from the star .",
    "the best - fit value of the line ratio @xmath29 deduced from observations corresponds to the radial location of the emitting plasma at @xmath40 .",
    "the nvi emission line indicates a plasma temperature of @xmath41mk , which could be reached in a strong shock with a velocity jump by @xmath42kms@xmath3 .",
    "the broadening of the x - ray lines from wr6 is consistent with the known terminal velocity of the wind of @xmath43kms@xmath3 .",
    "the lines centers are displaced from their laboratory wavelengths by @xmath44   ( see fig.[fig : nvii ] ) .",
    "such blue - shifts are predicted if the line emission is distributed within a partly absorbing wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , according to the standard model , the wind of wr6 remains optically thick till large distances from the star ( 550  900@xmath20 for @xmath45 ) .",
    "x - rays can hardly emerge from interior to this location unless the wind is very porous .",
    "we employed our 2-d stochastic wind code @xcite to model the observed x - ray lines . relaxing the microclumping approximation",
    ", the clumps may have arbitrary optical depth ( `` macroclumping '' ) .",
    "this wind fragmentation alters the radiative transfer drastically , compared to a homogeneous wind with the same mass - loss rate @xcite .",
    "the x - rays can escape from deeper in the wind than indicated in the upper panel in fig.[fig : tau1 ] for the smooth - wind model .",
    "we assume that parcels of x - ray emitting gas are distributed between clumps of continuum - absorbing , cool wind .",
    "the wind is fully fragmented throughout the whole relevant radial range .",
    "the x - ray emission is placed only at radii larger than @xmath46 .",
    "since thermal x - ray emission arises from the decay of collisionally excited levels and from free - free emission , is plausible to assume that the emissivity scales as the square of the density , @xmath47 . with this scaling ,",
    "most x - rays are released close to @xmath46 .",
    "the intensity along any ray is reduced by the factor @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the summation over the optical depths through all individual clumps which are encountered .",
    "a grid of line models was calculated for different values of the radius @xmath46 and @xmath50  the time - averaged number of fragments in a radial direction .",
    "the radial dependence of the mass - absorption coefficient and the wind opacity was accounted for in the models .",
    "even with porosity , emission arising from too close to the star is totally trapped , while the adopted scaling of the emissivity with @xmath51 requires an unrealistic amount of energy being converted into x - rays .",
    "this excludes small values of @xmath46 . in the other extreme , when x - ray emission starts only at radii where the wind is already nearly transparent , the observed blue - shift and asymmetry of the line profiles can not be reproduced .",
    "the model line profiles shown in fig.[fig : nvii ] were calculated with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "observed temperatures up to 50mk require shock velocity jumps comparable to the wind speed . from uv spectra of wr6",
    "there is direct evidence that a fraction of the wind flows with much higher velocity ( up to 3,100kms@xmath3 ) than the general wind speed ( 1,700kms@xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the hottest gas is produced when very fast flows impacts on slowly moving clumps within the wind acceleration zone .",
    "such extreme shocks can not be maintained to large radii , but the hardest x - rays can escape from the inner wind owing to smaller absorption cross - sections at higher energies .",
    "exceptionally large , pancake - shaped clumps which form close to the photosphere at low velocities would resist the radiative acceleration .",
    "being an obstacle to the generally much faster wind , they create strong reverse shocks that may add more mass to the clump if the gas cools quickly , or generate bow shocks if it does not @xcite .",
    "self - consistent kinematic models of gayley ( in prep . ) show that 500kms@xmath3 shocks may be present at @xmath54 in the wind , suitable for x - ray escape if the wind is sufficiently porous .",
    "the x - ray emission of wr6 varies considerably @xcite .",
    "our new observations confirm and extend these results .",
    "the xmm-_newton _  light curve shows different variability time scales , including a variation of 20% over a month s span .",
    "we also observe some spectral changes .",
    "the x - ray variability does not follow the 3.766d period which is seen in the optical and uv @xcite .",
    "the x - ray variability of wr6 further highlights the differences between single wr and o stars .",
    "the latter are remarkably constant x - ray sources ( naz  2012 , submitted ) .",
    "the optical variability of wr6 has long been known @xcite , and it appears to be incompatible with stellar pulsations or the be star phenomenology @xcite .",
    "most plausibly , the variability is due to changes of wind structures @xcite .",
    "this explanation is in line with our new x - ray observations .",
    "@xcite established that if the 3.766day period were associated with binarity , the mass of the secondary star could not be larger than @xmath55 .",
    "a star of such mass and age ( assuming coeval formation of both binary components ) would be either a degenerate neutron star ( ns ) or a pre main - sequence young stellar object ( ttauri type star ) .",
    "the ns scenario was criticized because of the relatively low x - ray luminosity of wr6 and the lack of evidence in its uv spectrum @xcite .",
    "the wr+ttau scenario is also extremely unlikely , as the high - resolution x - ray spectrum of wr6 is incompatible with the x - ray properties of young stellar objects @xcite .",
    "variability is a common property of wr stars . among",
    "rigorously monitored wn stars , 40%  show optical variability similar to wr6 @xcite .",
    "the assumption that 40%  of all wn stars have a ns or a ttauri type companion is not realistic .    our high - resolution x - ray spectra show that the x - ray emitting plasma moves at about the same velocity as the cool wind .",
    "the x - ray line blue - shifts do apparently not change with time .",
    "the x - ray emission line spectrum is compatible with the wn star abundances .",
    "all these facts add further evidence against wr6 being a binary system .",
    "assuming that wr6 is typical , our results show that in the winds of wn stars strong shocks are active at large radii from stellar photosphere .",
    "a possible explanation involves slow , dense clumps that accumulate from the wind close above the photosphere without being effectively accelerated .",
    "the seeding of such slow clumps might be associated with ( sub)surface convective zones @xcite .",
    "the effects of such wind anisotropies on the distribution of circumstellar matter could influence the behavior of snibc .    in any case , from high - resolution x - ray spectral data of wr6 we conclude that unknown mechanisms must operate in wr winds . identifying these mechanisms poses a challenging problem for the theory of stellar winds .",
