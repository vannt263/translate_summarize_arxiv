    "the modified theory of gravity has been introduced even before the lovelock theory @xcite . the advantage of the lovelock theory @xcite is to keep the field equations to second order ( derivative of metric function ) , as the original idea of einstein s theory .",
    "in addition the lovelock theory is ghost - free @xcite and a generalized birkho theorem is also valid there @xcite .",
    "unlike einstein s theory , the modified theory of gravity proposed by lovelock @xcite includes the higher order of curvature and in its most general form its lagrangian is given by@xmath1 } \\alpha _ { s}\\mathcal{l}% _ { s}\\]]in which @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the @xmath4order lovelock parameter and lagrangian respectively .",
    "for instance , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9gauss - bonnet parameter and @xmath10@xmath11third order lovelock parameter and @xmath12and so on . in particular , the second order ( which is known as the gauss - bonnet theory of gravity @xcite ) and the third order of lovelock gravity",
    "have received intensive attentions during the last decades @xcite .    in this brief report , our main concern is the black hole solution in static spherically symmetric third order lovelock gravity which was first introduced in @xcite and ever since has been studied in different aspects @xcite .",
    "we shall show in this study that the only real solution for the einstein equations in third order lovelock gravity fails to give the second order lovelock black hole solution ( gb solution ) when the third order lovelock parameter @xmath13 is set to zero ( this has been indirectly noted by wheeler in @xcite and later on by myers and simon in @xcite ) .",
    "this indeed does not mean that the solution found is not correct but perhaps this signals that this solution is not a solution one may wish to find .",
    "we also show that the correct gb limit of the solution comes from the complex solutions of the third order lovelock gravity .",
    "finally we introduce a new solution to the third order lovelock gravity which is acceptable for the small values of @xmath13 and it has the correct gb limit . our analysis is first given in @xmath14dimensions vacuum without cosmological constant and a trivial generalization to @xmath15dimensional with cosmological constant and matter source will be determined after .",
    "we start with the action of the third order lovelock gravity in @xmath14dimensions ( @xmath16)@xmath17 in which the ricci scalar is shown with @xmath18 which is also the first order lovelock lagrangian , @xmath19 is the second order lovelock lagrangian which is the well known gauss - bonnet term and finally the third order lovelock lagrangian is shown by @xmath20 also , @xmath21 and @xmath13 are the gauss - bonnet and third order lovelock parameters .",
    "the static spherically symmetric line element is given by@xmath22where @xmath23 is given by the einstein equations @xmath24 in which @xmath25 is the einstein tensor and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the lovelock tensors @xcite .",
    "after an integration of the @xmath28 component of the field equations ( 6 ) @xcite the metric function is given by a third order ordinary equation @xmath29 in which @xmath30 is the integration constant and relates to the mass of the possible black hole solution . for our convenience",
    "let s introduce @xmath31which upon ( 8) the main equation ( 7 ) becomes @xmath32the solution of this equation when both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are zero is just @xmath35 in which the subscript @xmath36 denotes the first order lovelock solution which is gr solution .",
    "the gb solution is given if @xmath37 but @xmath38 and therefore there are two solutions satisfying@xmath39which are given by@xmath40herein the subscript @xmath41 denotes the second order lovelock solution or gb solution .",
    "imposing the condition that @xmath42 suggests that the only acceptable / physical solution is the positive branch i.e. , @xmath43we note that although @xmath33 and @xmath44 are two real numbers but to avoid non - physical solutions an additional constraint must be considered which is @xmath45    next , we consider @xmath46 and @xmath47 which in turn ( 7 ) admits three distinct solutions ( one real and two complex)@xmath48{\\delta } + % \\frac{4\\left ( \\tilde{\\alpha}_{2}^{2}-3\\tilde{\\alpha}_{3}\\right ) } { \\sqrt[3]{% \\delta } } -2\\tilde{\\alpha}_{2}\\right ) , \\]]@xmath49{% \\delta } + \\frac{4\\left ( \\tilde{\\alpha}_{2}^{2}-3\\tilde{\\alpha}_{3}\\right ) } { % \\sqrt[3]{\\delta } } + 4\\tilde{\\alpha}_{2}\\right ) \\pm \\\\ \\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{12\\tilde{\\alpha}_{3}}\\left ( \\sqrt[3]{\\delta } -\\frac{4\\left (   \\tilde{\\alpha}_{2}^{2}-3\\tilde{\\alpha}_{3}\\right ) } { \\sqrt[3]{\\delta } } \\right)\\end{gathered}\\]]in which@xmath50where@xmath51and@xmath52here also the subscript @xmath53 denotes the third order lovelock solution .",
    "now , similar to the gb solution , we require that the solutions ( 13)-(14 ) to give the gb limit when @xmath54 .",
    "to do so we expand all the three solutions ( 13)-(14 ) around @xmath37 to find@xmath55@xmath56it is observed that @xmath57 is singular at @xmath58 while @xmath59 which are the desired gb limits .",
    "it is clear now why the known black hole solution in third order lovelock gravity does not give the gb limit . as a result",
    ", non of the solutions of the form given in ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) can represent an acceptable solution in third order lovelock gravity with the correct gb limit .",
    "perhaps the solution @xmath60 is more physical than the other complex solutions and that is why in many references , ( 13 ) was considered as the third order lovelock black hole solution in spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "although the adopted solution in third order lovelock gravity is @xmath60 but one should not forget that it fails to give gb limit when @xmath61 .",
    "the same argument is also valid for the gb black hole solutions @xmath62 as we have shown above , the positive branch of ( 11 ) yields the gr limit when @xmath63 and therefore it is called physical solution while the negative branch which has no gr limit is called exotic solution .    from the nature of the field equations , one has no hope to avoid such ambiguity but here we try to find a solution which for small value of @xmath64 satisfies the field equation ( 7 ) and correctly has the gb limit .",
    "let us reconsider the general equation ( 7 ) and introduce @xmath65 in which for small @xmath44 we keep up to the linear term i.e.@xmath66a substitution in eq .",
    "( 7 ) and eliminating the higher order of @xmath67 terms one finds @xmath68a solution to this equation is found if@xmath69and@xmath70the zero order condition ( 23 ) is the gb equation ( 10 ) and therefore @xmath71 the first order condition ( 24 ) also gives@xmath72or consequently@xmath73combining the results up to the first order of the third order lovelock parameter , the solution becomes@xmath74this technique , in principle , can be used for higher order of @xmath67 but we shall not go through this here .",
    "the above solution has the correct limit of gb when @xmath37 and also for the case at which @xmath75 the solution is still valid but @xmath76",
    "the @xmath15dimensional third order lovelock theory of gravity coupled to a matter source with cosmological constant is described by the following action@xmath77the static spherically symmetric line element is given by @xmath78and @xmath23 is given by the einstein equations@xmath79 in which @xmath80 is the energy - momentum tensor representing the matter fields . using @xmath81 , the @xmath28 component of the field equations ( 30 ) yields@xmath82 in which @xmath83 is the @xmath28 component of the energy momentum tensor and @xmath84@xmath85setting @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( 31 ) , we refined the previously discussed equation ( 9 ) .",
    "this means that the @xmath15dimensional case with cosmological constant and matter field reduces to the case of @xmath14dimensional , providing @xmath87 is given by ( 34 ) .",
    "dimensional metric function @xmath88 in terms of @xmath89 for @xmath90 @xmath91 and various values of @xmath92 the form of @xmath93 is approximated in eq .",

    "the third order lovelock theory of gravity admits static spherical symmetric black hole solution in @xmath94 dimensions which unexpectedly does not admit the gb black hole solution when the third order lovelock parameter vanishes .",
