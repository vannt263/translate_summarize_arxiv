    "the study of correlation driven metal - insulator transition ( mit ) has attracted great attention in recent years .",
    "the mit is realized in a number of transition metal oxides and organic compounds by application of the pressure or chemical substitutions.@xcite far from the transition point the metallic phase is well described by the fermi liquid theory while in the insulating phase the electrons are localized .",
    "when the magnetic frustration is large , the mit occurs in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the metallic state is a fermi liquid with a renormalized mass .",
    "the renormalized mass increases as the transition is approached .",
    "this is the essence of the brinkman - rice theory of the mit.@xcite the brinkman - rice scenario of the mit is substantially developed by the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) of the hubbard model in the paramagnetic phase.@xcite the essential features of the mit studied within the dmft is a nonanalytical structure of the phase transition , which consists of the first - order transition line ending in a second - order transition point and the high temperature crossover line.@xcite the nonanalytical structure of the mit has been observed experimentally,@xcite as well as has been confirmed by cluster dmft@xcite and by other techniques.@xcite    recently , the experimental realization of a single layer of graphite , known as graphene,@xcite has brought up renewed interest in the low temperature physics of the electrons on the honeycomb lattice . in the honeycomb lattice at half filling the noninteracting fermi surface collapses into the edge points of the brillouin zone . the tight - binding dispersion exhibits the dirac cone near these points , and the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level vanishes .",
    "the electrons on the honeycomb lattice closely resemble the one of massless dirac fermions in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "in particular , the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice can be considered as an asymptotic infrared massive quantum electron dynamics in @xmath0 dimensions.@xcite therefore , the electrons on the honeycomb lattice provide a condensed matter analogy of relativistic physics of electrons .",
    "the honeycomb lattice is also a basis structure of a number of materials such as magnesium diboride@xcite or layered nitride superconductors@xcite .",
    "electron correlations constitute the essential properties of these materials such as unconventional superconductivity.@xcite the emergence of electron correlations and the specific features of the honeycomb lattice structure underlies the material properties . the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice",
    "is a minimal model to describe the emergence of electron correlations in the specific lattice structure .    for weak local interactions",
    "the electrons on the honeycomb lattice always stay in the paramagnetic state .",
    "there is no presence of superconducting or magnetic instabilities at weak coupling.@xcite the interaction only renormalizes the fermi velocity . with increasing the local interaction the renormalized velocity decreases .",
    "when the renormalized velocity vanishes the electrons are localized and the state is insulating.@xcite it is a scenario of the semimetal - insulator transition ( smit ) on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the transition occurs in the paramagnetic phase , and it is a version of the mott mit .",
    "however , due to the absence of the quasiparticle mass , the brinkman - rice scenario of the mit can not be applied to the honeycomb lattice .",
    "parallel to the smit , at low temperatures the local interaction in the honeycomb lattice can lock electrons with different spins into the different sublattices that creates a magnetic long - range order .",
    "the numerical simulations also find a semimetal - antiferromagnetic insulator transition ( smafit ) on the honeycomb lattice at low temperatures.@xcite this transition is a type of the slater mit which is driven by long - range order . in the honeycomb lattice",
    "the mott and the slater mit compete with each other . however , when the magnetic frustration is strong they can destroy the magnetic long - range order , and there is only the mott transition .",
    "the previous dmft studies of the smit on the honeycomb lattice showed that the smit is a second - order transition in the paramagnetic phase,@xcite whereas the variational calculations showed a first - order transition characteristic of the smit.@xcite in this paper we reexamine the smit on the honeycomb lattice by the dmft .",
    "we find a nonanalytical structure of the smit on the honeycomb lattice which has not been pointed out in the previous dmft studies.@xcite the nonanalytical structure is reminiscent to the phase structure of the mit in the square or the bethe lattices where the dos at the fermi level is finite.@xcite it also consists of the first - order transition line ending in a second - order transition point and the high temperature crossover line .",
    "however , in contrast to the square or the bethe lattices , the smit on the honeycomb lattice does not accompany the appearance and the disappearance of a quasiparticle peak at the fermi level .",
    "the absence of a quasiparticle state at the fermi level is a specific feature of the electron dynamics in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the smit on the honeycomb lattice is accompanied with the appearance and the disappearance of a pseudogap structure near the fermi level .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the dmft for the hubbard model in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv conclusion and remarks are presented .",
    "we consider the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the creation and the annihilation operator of electrons at site @xmath4 with spin @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the density operator .",
    "@xmath7 is the hopping integral between nearest neighbor sites @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
    "we will take @xmath7 as the unit of energy .",
    "@xmath9 is the local interaction and @xmath10 is the chemical potential . in the following",
    "we will consider only the half filling case , i.e. @xmath11 . the honeycomb lattice has a specific feature in the band structure , where the fermi surface of noninteracting electrons at half filling is just the edge points of the brillouin zone .",
    "the tight - binding dispersion near these points exhibits the dirac cone like the relativistic electrons and the dos at the fermi level vanishes .",
    "the noninteracting electrons on the honeycomb lattice is a semimetal which has a zero gap at the fermi level .",
    "the specific feature distinguishes the honeycomb lattice from other lattices such as the square or the bethe lattices where the dos at the fermi level is finite .",
    "apparently , in the honeycomb lattice the concept of effective mass is not appropriate to describe the electron properties . as a consequence ,",
    "the standard description of the mott mit is not valid in the honeycomb lattice . to reveal the nature of the smit in the honeycomb lattice we use the dmft.@xcite the dmft is exact in infinite dimensions",
    "however , for two dimensional lattices the dmft neglects nonlocal correlations .",
    "the cluster dmft studies for a square lattice have shown that the key features of the mit are already captured by the single - site dmft.@xcite thus , one can expect a similarity for the honeycomb lattice .    since the honeycomb lattice is a bravais lattice with a basis of two lattice sites , the electron green function can be written in the form of matrix @xmath12 @xmath13^{-1 } , \\label{dyson}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the matsubara frequency , @xmath15 is the self energy , and @xmath16 is the bare green function of noninteracting electrons .",
    "the bare green function is @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "equation ( [ dyson ] ) is just the dyson equation . within the dmft ,",
    "the self energy is approximated by a local function of frequency , i.e. , @xmath19 note that within the dmft the off diagonal elements of the self energy are neglected .",
    "these elements vanish in infinite dimensions . in finite dimension lattices",
    "they are indeed nonlocal correlation quantities .",
    "the self energy @xmath20 is determined from the dynamics of single - site electrons embedded in an effective mean field medium .",
    "once the effective single - site problem is solved the self energy is calculated by the dyson equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the bare green function of the effective single site and represents the effective mean field acting on the site .",
    "@xmath23 is the electron green function of the effective single site .",
    "the self consistent condition requires that the green function @xmath23 of the effective single site must coincide with the local green function of the original lattice .",
    "i.e. , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of lattice sites . equations ( [ dyson])-([cons ] ) form the self consistent system of equations for the lattice green function and the self energy .",
    "they are principal equations of the dmft . in order to solve the effective single site problem we use the exact diagonalization technique.@xcite the exact diagonalization maps the effective single site problem into an anderson impurity model @xmath26 where the local impurity represented by @xmath27 , @xmath28 couples to a bath of free conduction electrons represented by @xmath29 , @xmath30 with dispersion @xmath31 via a hybridization @xmath32 . in the exact diagonalization",
    "the effective medium green function @xmath33 is approximated by the corresponding green function @xmath34 calculated within the anderson impurity model of a finite number of bath levels @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of bath levels .",
    "the model parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 are determined by minimization of the distance function @xmath37 the parameter @xmath38 if chosen large ( @xmath39 ) enhances the importance of the lowest matsubara frequencies in the minimization procedure . in particular",
    ", we take @xmath40 in the following numerical calculations .",
    "when the model parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 are obtained we solve the anderson impurity model by the exact diagonalization and obtain the local green function @xmath41 , and then the self energy @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we obtain a closed self consistent system of equations for determining the electron green function within the dmft .",
    "we solve the dmft equations by iterations.@xcite most calculations are performed with @xmath42 positive matsubara frequencies and lattice size of @xmath43 sites . for very low temperature ( for instance @xmath44 )",
    "we take @xmath45 .",
    "the exact diagonalization of the anderson impurity model is performed with @xmath46 .",
    "we have checked the agreement between @xmath33 and @xmath34 and found a good agreement for whole model parameter range under consideration .",
    "we find two typical solutions , one is semimetal and the other is insulator .",
    "the dos of these solutions is presented in fig .",
    "the semimetal solution is characterized by a pseudogap near the fermi level , while the insulator solution opens a wide gap at the fermi level . in the semimetallic phase the dos shows two hubbard subbands and the pseudogap structure between them .",
    "in contrast to the square or the bethe lattices , no kondo quasiparticle peak appears at the fermi level . in the honeycomb lattice the dos of noninteracting electrons linearly vanishes at the fermi level , so that the kondo - singlet formation resulted in the effective single - site problem is suppressed.@xcite the feature of the noninteracting dos is retained in the interacting case , so that the relativistic properties of the electrons in the honeycomb lattice are maintained as far as the system does not approach the smit .",
    "the local interaction only renormalizes the fermi velocity which can be seen by the increase of the slope of the dos near the fermi level when the interaction increases .",
    "when the slope of the dos near the fermi level becomes very large , it closes the pseudogap and the system transforms to the insulating phase . at the point of the smit",
    "the pseudogap structure disappears and leaves a wide gap in the dos . in the insulating phase",
    "the dos exhibits only two hubbard subbands separated by the gap .",
    "the smit scenario in the honeycomb lattice is reminiscent to the mit in the square or the bethe lattices .",
    "the crucial different feature is the absence of the kondo quasiparticle state at the fermi level in the honeycomb lattice . as a consequence ,",
    "the brinkman - rice scenario of a divergence of the effective mass at the transition point is not valid . instead ,",
    "in the honeycomb lattice the renormalized fermi velocity vanishes when the system crosses the transition point .",
    "this smit scenario was also observed in the dmft studies with the iterated perturbation theory as the impurity solver.@xcite however , at finite temperature we observe a coexistence of the semimetallic and the insulating solutions at intermediate interactions which has not been pointed in the previous dmft studies.@xcite     for various @xmath9 at temperature @xmath47 .",

    "the renormalized factor of the fermi velocity is @xmath51 figure [ figb ] shows that in the semimetallic phase @xmath52 as @xmath49 .",
    "it leads the dos to be vanished at the fermi level . as the interaction increases the slope of @xmath48 for @xmath49 increases , so that the renormalized factor @xmath53 gradually decreases .",
    "when the system transforms to the insulating phase the renormalized factor @xmath53 vanishes . apparently , in the insulating phase",
    "the concept of the fermi velocity is not valid and the use of eq .",
    "[ z ] does not make sense .",
