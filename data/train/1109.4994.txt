    "a bounded physical system with bounded energy has only a finite - sized set of distinct ( mutually orthogonal ) possible states @xcite , and can only transition from one distinct state to another at a finite rate @xcite .",
    "this finiteness is reconciled with an infinity of possible positions and times in its quantum description by the bounded energy : limiting the amount of high - frequency content in the momentum and energy amplitude distributions limits the amount of spatial and temporal detail described .",
    "the tradeoff between width of a frequency distribution and resolution in the fourier - conjugate domain has been a fundamental feature of quantum physics since the advent of the wavefunction @xcite .",
    "the standard deviation is the most famous measure of the frequency width used , but useful uncertainty bounds often require other measures @xcite .",
    "in fact , the average energy itself ( relative to the ground state ) provides a natural measure of the width of the energy eigenfrequency distribution , and bounds the _ minimum time _ between distinct states @xcite .",
    "here we generalize the average energy bound in two ways . taking its lowest possible energy to be zero @xcite , an isolated system s average energy @xmath0 also bounds the _ average time _",
    "@xmath1 between distinct states : @xmath2 where the average is taken over an evolution through many distinct states .",
    "a similar result holds for magnitude of average momentum @xmath3 and the _ average distance _",
    "@xmath4 between distinct positions of the center - of - energy of a freely moving system : @xmath5    these bounds depend on fundamental conserved quantities , making them in some cases more directly applicable than bounds based on standard deviations @xcite .",
    "for example , the bound on average energy is related to bounds on average photon number in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we show that , for a periodic quantum evolution with period @xmath6 that passes through @xmath7 distinct ( mutually orthogonal ) states at a constant rate , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the lowest energy eigenvalue used in constructing the system s state .",
    "the left hand side is a measure of the width of the energy eigenfrequency distribution : twice the average half - width .",
    "the right hand side is the minimum frequency bandwidth for @xmath7 distinct frequencies separated from each other by at least @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "here we see that ( [ eq.eband ] ) holds even if the time intervals between distinct states are unconstrained . for large @xmath7",
    "this becomes ( [ eq.et ] ) , which also holds if the average @xmath1 is taken over a long _ non - repeating _ sequence of distinct states .",
    "consider a finite - sized isolated quantum system with a time evolution that can be expressed as a superposition of energy eigenstates @xcite , with an energy spectrum bounded from below : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and the average energy is @xmath13 if the evolution passes through a series of mutually orthogonal states @xmath14 at times @xmath15 , we must have @xmath16 we seek a bound on the minimum energy ( [ eq.e ] ) that satisfies the constraints ( [ eq.orthogt ] ) for any spectrum of @xmath17 and for any set of @xmath7 distinct states occurring in an interval of length @xmath6 .",
    "we can assume without loss of generality that all the @xmath17 are distinct @xcite , and we first consider the case where the evolution is periodic with period @xmath6 .",
    "then the discrete spectrum of the system , bounded from below , includes _ at most _ all of the evenly - spaced frequencies @xmath18 with @xmath19 a non - negative integer .",
    "these are all of the possible eigenfrequencies of energy eigenstates that cycle with period @xmath6 , up to an overall phase .",
    "we bound the minimum average energy compatible with this spectrum .",
    "we know from @xcite that , for an isolated system , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the minimum time interval between orthogonal states traversed during the system s evolution . as with ( [ eq.eband ] )",
    "the right hand side is a minimum frequency bandwidth : in this case there must be at least two frequencies , separated by at least @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the smallest @xmath0 is allowed by ( [ eq.taumin ] ) when @xmath21 is largest . for a periodic evolution passing through @xmath7 distinct states in period @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath21 is largest when all intervals between consecutive distinct states equal @xmath23 ( since not all intervals can be above average ) .    for mutually orthogonal states equally separated in time @xcite , @xmath24 and from ( [ eq.orthogt ] ) and ( [ eq.nun ] ) , @xmath25 for an energetically optimal evolution , @xmath26 for @xmath27 , since if @xmath28 is nonzero we can get exactly the same set of orthogonality times with a lower average energy by setting @xmath29 and increasing the magnitude of @xmath30 .",
    "then , since @xmath31 , the @xmath32 for @xmath33 are just the discrete fourier transform of a kronecker delta impulse , and so they all equal @xmath34 .",
    "thus the average frequency is just the midpoint of a frequency range of width @xmath35 , which gives the bound ( [ eq.eband ] ) .",
    "this bound is generally achievable for macroscopic systems @xcite : in a system where the energy spectrum is nearly continuous , it s achieved by constructing an equally weighted superposition of a set of energy eigenfunctions with equally spaced energy eigenvalues .      since @xmath36",
    ", substituting @xmath23 for @xmath21 in ( [ eq.taumin ] ) directly yields the bound @xmath37 this bound agrees with ( [ eq.eband ] ) for @xmath38 , which is the only case for which ( [ eq.taumin ] ) is exactly achievable @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a factor of 2 difference between ( [ eq.eband ] ) and ( [ eq.n2 t ] ) for large @xmath7 , where ( [ eq.eband ] ) is achievable but ( [ eq.n2 t ] ) is not .    of course",
    "even the stronger bound ( [ eq.eband ] ) becomes irrelevant if @xmath39 , in which case ( [ eq.taumin ] ) dominates .",
    "in fact if @xmath21 is small enough , ( [ eq.taumin ] ) is asymptotically achievable with any number of distinct states @xcite .      the argument from ( [ eq.taumin ] ) , that minimum energy requires equal intervals , is only rigorous when ( [ eq.taumin ] ) is achievable .",
    "we also observe , though , that making the intervals equal constrains the energy minimization problem the least .",
    "if all @xmath7 intervals are equal , then @xmath40 distinct constraint equations ( [ eq.orthogt ] ) must equal zero .",
    "otherwise there are more constraints .",
    "suppose , for example , that all but one of the intervals are equal . then @xmath41 constraint equations ( [ eq.orthogt ] ) must equal zero , except in the special case where the size of the exceptional interval is an integer multiple of the others .",
    "if the integer is 2 , then only @xmath7 equations must equal zero . in this case",
    "the constraints are exactly the same as for the case with @xmath42 equal intervals , and so the bound ( [ eq.eband ] ) for @xmath42 intervals applies .",
    "@xmath43{min - bound - different - lines2}}\\hfill\\ ] ]    this argument correctly predicts the minimum energy seen with two different interval lengths ( @xmath44 ) in numerical experiments , depicted in figure  [ fig.unequal-times ] . to construct this diagram , a million sets of @xmath15 s",
    "were generated stochastically , with each set involving only 2 , 3 , or 4 different interval lengths between adjacent @xmath15 s ( but with up to n=20 @xmath15 s ) .",
    "for each set of @xmath15 s , a set of @xmath45 s that satisfy ( [ eq.orthogt ] ) while minimizing energy was determined using linear programming @xcite , and the resulting energy @xmath46 is plotted . here",
    "@xmath47 is the value of @xmath0 that achieves the bound ( [ eq.eband ] ) , and energy is in units of @xmath48 .",
    "small integer interval lengths ( up to 100 ) were used , to ensure that the cases with the fewest constraints  which depend on integer ratios of interval lengths  were well sampled .    generalizing",
    "the argument given for @xmath44 predicts that , for @xmath49 , the minimum energy should grow quadratically with @xmath50 @xcite , and this prediction was verified experimentally . for the values of @xmath50 in figure  [ fig.unequal-times ] , though , we see minima that grow only linearly with @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the deviation from the quadratic bound comes entirely from cases with @xmath51 .      from ( [ eq.et ] ) , the average bandwidth @xmath52 used to describe a long quantum evolution bounds the average rate of distinct change @xmath53 . though derived in the periodic case , this remains true even if the rate average is taken over a non - repeating sequence of distinct states .",
    "this is related to the fact that isolated quantum evolutions are well approximated by periodic evolutions @xcite .",
    "we see from ( [ eq.orthogt ] ) that , for bounding the average energy ( [ eq.e ] ) required to allow @xmath7 mutually orthogonal states in an interval of length @xmath6 , the only things that matter are the set of intervals @xmath54 between the distinct states , and the eigenfrequency spectrum .",
    "if , in addition to ( [ eq.orthogt ] ) , we also impose the constraint that the evolution is periodic with period @xmath6 , then the allowed eigenfrequencies are restricted to those given by ( [ eq.nun ] ) .",
    "this is a mild constraint , however , since whatever discrete spectrum a given system may have is approximated as closely as desired by a subset of ( [ eq.nun ] ) if we make @xmath6 large enough .",
    "thus for an average separation @xmath1 , ( [ eq.et ] ) holds for @xmath7 large enough .      for a quantum simple harmonic oscillator , with the minimum of the potential energy function set to zero , position - momentum uncertainty dictates ( _ e.g. , _",
    "* sec 7 - 5 ) ) that the average energy @xmath0 and period @xmath6 obey @xmath55 an identical bound follows from ( [ eq.eband ] ) for any periodic evolution through _ distinct states _",
    "( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath56 ) with ground state energy zero .",
    "this second bound can also be interpreted as an _ unconditional _ constraint on the minimum average energy of a periodic - hamiltonian dynamics , if we can regard the dynamics as a portion of a larger dynamics that defines the period and the zero of energy .",
    "consider , again , the simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "its period is determined by parameters such as mass and spring constant that are nt modeled as dynamical degrees of freedom of the hamiltonian .",
    "if we consider the oscillator to be part of a larger dynamics that includes additional degrees of freedom that determine the period , then if the period is always evident in this larger dynamics as distinct state change , the bound ( [ eq.et ] ) defines the minimum energy in the larger system ( taking its ground state energy as zero ) needed to have an oscillator .",
    "notice that if the ground state energy @xmath9 obeys ( [ eq.et ] ) , then from ( [ eq.eband ] ) any state of an isolated periodic dynamics that has the full period @xmath6 obeys ( [ eq.et ] ) even for an evolution through a small number @xmath7 of distinct states . for @xmath57 , which is",
    "an unchanging state , ( [ eq.et ] ) becomes ( [ eq.et ] ) .",
    "even if an isolated system is approximately unchanging during some interval  viewed in its rest frame  it may pass through a large number of distinct positional states if viewed in another frame .",
    "counting states distinct due to a system s overall motion , we construct a bound on the average distance the system moves between them .",
    "consider the energy bound ( [ eq.et ] ) applied in two different special - relativistic frames ( taking @xmath58 in both @xcite ) . to simplify formulas we choose units in which @xmath59 .    in the laboratory frame ,",
    "the number of distinct states that an isolated system traverses in moving freely at velocity @xmath60 for a time @xmath61 ( moving a distance @xmath62 ) is @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , up to @xmath64 states are distinct in the rest frame .",
    "since no rest frame states are distinct due to net motion of the system , the difference @xmath65 counts the maximum number of distinct states in the laboratory frame that can be attributed to net motion , and in fact defines what we mean by this . if @xmath4 is the average distance between distinct positions of the center of energy @xcite , then @xmath66 , and so ( [ eq.px ] ) follows .",
    "this bound applies to each orthogonal direction separately : if the system moves a distance @xmath67 in the direction of its average momentum @xmath68 then the maximum number of distinct states attributable to net motion is @xmath69 , which is the sum of the maxima allowed by ( [ eq.px ] ) for each orthogonal direction .",
    "if we model the motion of a free particle by treating its rest energy @xmath70 as its minimum possible energy @xmath9 , then from ( [ eq.et ] ) kinetic energy @xmath71 is the maximum average rate of distinct state change .",
    "more realistically , though , @xmath70 is the average energy of a rest frame dynamics , and so @xmath71 is the difference of maximum rates in two different frames  which is not a rate in either .",
    "we see , dividing ( [ eq.edt ] ) by @xmath61 , that it is actually the slightly larger quantity @xmath72 that bounds the average rate of motional state change , even at low velocities .",
    "we recognize the energy @xmath73 as the average value of a hamiltonian that shifts a given state at constant velocity @xmath60 in the direction of its average momentum : @xmath74 thus @xmath75 can be associated with splitting an overall hamiltonian @xmath76 into @xmath77 : a pure shift plus a dynamics that , if applied by itself , would evolve the state omitting the overall motion .",
    "if we consider only states for which negative eigenvalues of @xmath78 have negligible weight , then ( [ eq.et ] ) applies directly to the shift energy @xmath79 to bound the average rate of motional state change .",
    "take the @xmath80 direction along @xmath60 , so @xmath81 , and consider states for which negative eigenvalues of @xmath82 have negligible weight .",
    "let @xmath21 be the minimum time between distinct states under the shift @xmath83 , and @xmath84 the minimum distance",
    ". then @xmath85 and hence from ( [ eq.taumin ] ) , @xmath86 we interpret @xmath87 as the minimum distance between distinct positions of the center of energy . for states with only non - negative eigenvalues of @xmath82 , @xmath88 , and",
    "so a similar bound involving @xmath89 derived in @xcite applies to the problem considered here .",
    "the maximum average rate at which an isolated system can traverse a long sequence of distinct states is @xmath90 , taking its ground state energy to be zero .",
    "this bound is a consequence of fourier analysis : the average bandwidth is bounded by the minimum possible bandwidth .",
    "relativity imposes a corresponding bound on the average spatial rate of change of @xmath91 .",
    "consequently , @xmath92 is the portion of the total energy that bounds the time rate of motional state change .",
    "other tight bounds also follow from the premise that the average energy eigenfrequency bandwidth @xmath93 must at least equal the minimum bandwidth required by constraints on the separations in time between mutually orthogonal states .",
    "similar bounds apply if there is a maximum frequency , using @xmath94 as average bandwidth ( let @xmath95 in the analysis above ) .",
    "these bounds carry over to classical communications theory : a unidirectional noiseless communications channel can be modeled as a special case of the 1d quantum shift dynamics @xmath96 .",
    "more generally , these bounds apply to invertible classical finite - state dynamics modeled as special cases of hamiltonian quantum dynamics @xcite . in this context ,",
    "finiteness of energy and momentum are consequences of bounded fourier spectra of continuous functions used to describe systems with finite resolution in time and space , and average energies and momenta count finite rates of change in the finite - state dynamics .",
