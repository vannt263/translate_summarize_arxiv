    "the star formation process is intertwined with the evolution of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . after the onset of a burst of star formation , massive stars photoionize the ambient ism into an hii region , and subsequently energize the ambient medium via fast stellar winds and supernova ejecta to form a superbubble .",
