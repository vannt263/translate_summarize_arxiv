    "the edgeworth kuiper belt ( kb ) is often discussed in terms of three dynamical families ; 1 ) the classical kuiper belt objects which occupy semi - major axes @xmath3 au and which have low eccentricities @xmath4 , 2 ) the resonant kuiper belt occupying the 3:2 and 2:1 mean motion resonances with neptune , denoted the plutinos and twotinos , respectively , and 3 ) the scattered kuiper belt occupying extreme orbits with high eccentricities ( @xmath5 up to 0.6 ) ( e.g , @xcite ) . most of the mass in the kuiper belt appears to reside in the classical kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "all three dynamical families contain objects with surprisingly high inclinations ( @xmath6 ; @xcite ) .",
    "current compilations suggest a bimodal distribution , with @xmath7 of the kuiper belt objects in low - inclination orbits of a few degrees and the remainder in highly inclined orbits with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "scenarios for the formation and evolution of the kuiper belt should explain the different kuiper belt object ( kbo ) populations .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the high kbo inclinations , including scattering by neptune during neptune s migration @xcite , passage through vertical resonances during neptune s migration or during the depletion of the solar nebula @xcite , wave excitation @xcite , perturbations from passing stars @xcite , and scattering by planets and planetesimals @xcite .",
    "while long term evolution can remove kbos with low inclinations , it can not explain the existence of classical kbos with extremely high inclinations of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "current surveys appear to rule out the possibility of a distant planetary embryo @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the possibility that perturbations from a stellar encounter could account for the high kbo inclinations , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the probability of a stellar encounter that passes with a few hundred au of the sun at its current position is extremely unlikely .",
    "however , most stars are formed in stellar groups or clusters @xcite , associated for @xmath10 years until they are tidally disrupted by molecular clouds and structure in the milky way disk @xcite .",
    "young stellar groups and clusters , can have stellar densities up to @xmath11 times higher than the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "the sun could have experienced a close stellar encounter when it was still in its birth cluster , @xcite .",
    "other disk systems such as beta pictorus and hd 100546 probably have suffered close stellar encounters @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the sun could have been part of a wide binary which was later disrupted ( e.g. , as @xcite ) .    as shown by @xcite in their study of the beta pictorus system , and others ( e.g. @xcite ) a close stellar encounter can scatter planetesimals . for an equal mass parabolic encounter with pericenter distance @xmath12 , planetesimals with semimajor axis @xmath13 are scattered , whereas those with @xmath14 are uniformly perturbed into higher eccentricity and inclination orbits @xcite .",
    "this division depends on the timescale of the encounter compared to the orbital rotation period of the planetesimals . in the inner disk , the planetesimals rotate quickly compared to the encounter time and the collision can be treated with a secular approximation , averaging over the entire orbit , as done in the appendix by @xcite .",
    "however , objects with larger semimajor axes are moving at speeds similar to the encountering star ( assuming a parabolic orbit ) . consequently the resulting perturbation on outer planetesimals",
    "is strongly dependent on their longitudes , as shown explicitly by @xcite .",
    "if the collision is very fast compared to the rotational timescale of the planetesimals , as would be the case if the star was on a highly hyperbolic orbit , then the impulse approximation can be used to estimate the perturbations caused by the encounter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "previous work considering the effect of a stellar encounter on our solar system has considered parabolic orbits with pericenter of size 100 - 200 au @xcite . at this distance",
    "the velocity of the perturber at pericenter is similar to the rotational velocity of kbos .",
    "for such an encounter the kuiper belt is in a transition region .",
    "the kbos experience increases in mean eccentricity and inclination which are dependent on their initial semimajor axes . because the final kbo orbits in this region also depend on the initial longitude",
    ", the eccentricity and inclination distribution broadens following the encounter .",
    "@xcite restricted their exploration to fairly large stellar pericenters @xmath15 au , which minimized the eccentricity variations in the kbos caused by the encounter .",
    "@xcite suggested that neptune s migration followed the encounter .",
    "kbos with initial eccentricities above 0.15 are unlikely to be captured in the 3:2 mean motion resonance with a migrating neptune @xcite .",
    "the encounters considered by @xcite were consistent with a scenario that included migration of neptune since the encounters did not induce high kbo eccentricities .    in this paper",
    "we extend the previous explorations by @xcite to include stars on orbits with smaller pericenters . in this regime",
    "the planetesimal perturbations are strongly dependent on the planetesimal longitude during the encounter .",
    "consequently we expect a larger spread in the resulting planetesimal planetesimal orbital properties , as seen in the outer parts of the planetesimal disks simulated by @xcite . here",
    "we explore a regime where the kuiper belt is more effectively scattered by the encounter than previously works have considered .",
    "in this section we discuss preliminary constraints on the orbit , mass and initial velocity of the stellar impactor .",
    "we maintain our hypothesis that the kuiper belt is strongly scattered by the encounter , but that it must retain low eccentricity and inclination objects as are found in the classical kuiper belt .",
    "furthermore we assert that uranus s orbit is not strongly perturbed by the encounter .",
    "the sun / stellar encounter is described by 5 free parameters , the mass of the star compared to the sun , @xmath16 , the velocity of the star distant from the sun , @xmath17 , the distance of closest approach from the sun or perihelion of the star , @xmath12 , the inclination of the star s orbit with respect to the ecliptic , @xmath18 , and the argument of perihelion , @xmath19 . for a pictorial view of these angles",
    "[ fig : impact ] which is based on fig .  1 by @xcite .",
    "the velocity of the incoming star is related to the eccentricity of the orbit @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 for a hyperbolic orbit .    for a star to scatter a planetesimal effectively",
    ", the star s velocity must be greater than the circular velocity of the planetesimal .",
    "the velocity of a star in a hyperbolic orbit at perihelion is @xmath23 we compare the star s velocity at perihelion with the velocity , @xmath24 , of a particle in a circular orbit with semi - major axis @xmath25 ; @xmath26 . allowing neptune to be in the scattered region , we require @xmath27 at neptune s @xmath28 au which implies that @xmath29 this sets pericenter @xmath30au if the star is on a parabolic orbit and if neptune is in the scattered region .",
    "we now constrain @xmath20 based on the most probably stellar incoming velocity .",
    "collisions are unlikely from field stars , so we expect an incoming stellar velocity of order a few km / s , typical of the velocity dispersion in young star clusters which have not yet dispersed or disrupted .",
    "@xmath31 the circular velocity is 4.2 km / s at a semi - major axis of 50  au , of order that which might be found in a young unbound cluster .",
    "since we do nt expect @xmath17 to be greater than a few km / s if the perturber is in a birth cluster , we infer that the encounter was likely to be nearly parabolic , ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "a hyperbolic orbit with a small pericenter from a faster field star would be possible , but it is much less likely than a parabolic one from a star in a dense birth cluster . if the encounter was a result of an interaction with a binary , then the velocity of the encounter would depend on the nature of the binary and how it was disrupted .",
    "we can set a condition on the orbit of the impactor by specifying that uranus does not significantly increase in inclination or eccentricity following the encounter .",
    "uranus is at small enough semimajor axis that we may assume that it moves quickly compared to the timescale of the encounter . to estimate the affect of the encounter on uranus we use equations 15 and 16 from @xcite which are appropriate for parabolic encounters in a secular approximation .",
    "@xmath33 based on uranus s inclination , @xmath34 , and semimajor axis , @xmath35 au , and assuming an encounter with @xmath36au we find @xmath37 if the star was low mass @xmath38 , then a reasonably large range of inclinations is allowed .",
    "since uranus s eccentricity increase is @xmath39 @xcite , uranus s low eccentricity is less of a constraint than its low inclination .",
    "if uranus was not strongly perturbed by the encounter , then the stellar impactor was likely to be a low mass star or on a low inclination orbit .    for particles with semi - major axes similar to the pericenter distance of the encounter ,",
    "the perturbation caused by the encounter is strongly dependent upon the particle s longitude .",
    "since these particles move slower than the star , we can use the impulse approximation to estimate the size of the perturbations .",
    "each particle undergoes a change in its velocity of order @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the distance between the object and the star s closest approach to it , and @xmath42 is the velocity of the star at pericenter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity change is in the direction toward the star at its position of closest approach .",
    "using cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath43 ) where @xmath44 is in the ecliptic , the position of the star s pericenter is @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "for an object opposite pericenter ( @xmath47 away ) @xmath48 to allow the inclination of particles opposite pericenter to remain low , we restrict the encounter to low arguments of perihelion and low inclinations .",
    "from the previous section we found that if neptune is in the scattered region , then @xmath49au . if the incoming star is part of the sun s birth cluster then we expect @xmath50 . to maintain uranus s low eccentricity and inclination , we require low inclination orbits and low mass stars . to ensure that the kuiper belt retains a low eccentricity and inclination population we require orbits with low inclinations and low arguments of perihelion .",
    "we take these estimates as guidelines for our numerical integrations .    to investigate the actual affect of a such a close stellar encounter on a primordial cold kuiper belt , we numerically integrated the two body sun / stellar gravitational system .",
    "our code is a conventional burlisch - stoer numerical scheme which considers only the force from newtonian gravity .",
    "simultaneously during the encounter we integrate 1000 low mass particles ( planetesimals ) per run which were initially placed in circular orbits in the ecliptic .",
    "these particles are influenced by the gravitational force from the sun and star but do not themselves act on the sun or star .",
    "the integrations were begun with the star at 500 au from the sun , and ended when the star reached an equivalent distance from the sun following the encounter .",
    "we began our simulations with planetesimals distributed randomly in semi - major axis between 30 and 70au and randomly chosen mean longitudes . following the encounter ,",
    "the final semi - major axes , eccentricities and inclinations of the particles were tabulated .    based on our constraints from the previous section",
    ", we explored planetesimal eccentricity and inclination distributions for encounters spanning @xmath51 , @xmath52 au with differing orbital inclinations and arguments of perihelion ( @xmath53 ) . since we expect that the encounter could have been in the sun s birth cluster , we restrict the incoming stellar velocity @xmath17 to less than a few km / s , equivalent to nearly parabolic encounters , @xmath54 . in this region",
    "of parameter space , we searched for final planetesimal distributions which contained both scattered and classical type kbo population analogs .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : retrograde ] we show the planetesimal distribution following a retrograde encounter with a star of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , pericenter @xmath57au , inclination @xmath58 and argument of perihelion @xmath59 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : retrograde ] , histograms are also shown for all particles with final semi - major axes between 33 and 50  au .",
    "examination of this figure shows that the inclination and eccentricity distribution following the encounter is wider at larger semi - major axes as expected from a comparison between the timescale of the encounter with the orbital period of the objects .",
    "we see that a significant fraction , but not all , of the belt is scattered , indicating that the final eccentricity and inclination of an object depends on its longitude during the collision ( as shown explicitly by @xcite ) .",
    "about 30% of objects with final semimajor axes between 33 and 50 au have inclinations above @xmath60 and eccentricities above @xmath61 .",
    "however , low eccentricity ( @xmath62 ) and low inclination ( @xmath63 ) objects remain in the planetesimal distribution .",
    "[ fig : retrograde ] can be compared to the distribution of known trans - neptunian objects ( as listed by the minor planet center jan .",
    "7 , 2004 ) which is given in the same format in fig .",
    "[ fig : tnos ] . to ensure accurate orbits ,",
    "only objects that have been observed over more than one opposition have been plotted .",
    "we must keep in mind that the known population of kbos is likely to be biased by the systematics of the observations ( e.g. , as discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "the kbo has also had @xmath64 4 billion years to evolve dynamically following the hypothetical collision considered here ( e.g. , as explored by @xcite ) .",
    "while the simulation of the retrograde encounter shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : retrograde ] does not exactly match the known kbo population ( the most obvious mismatch being the radial distribution ) , it successfully predicts the combined presence of objects with high inclinations and eccentricities while retaining a population with low inclinations and eccentricities , as required by the known kbo distribution .",
    "the inclination and eccentricity distribution following the encounter have high inclination and eccentricity tails , similar to those seen in the kbo comparison histograms .",
    "an object at the location of neptune ( 30au ) can remain in a low eccentricity and inclination orbit , so neptune itself could have survived the encounter with minimal changes in its orbital elements .",
    "the distribution of orbital elements for the retrograde encounter can be contrasted , for example , with the prograde encounter shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prograde ] which does not exhibit as broad a distribution of eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "the simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : retrograde ] ) we chose to directly compare to the current kbo population ( fig . [ fig : tnos ] ) corresponded to a low inclination retrograde encounter .",
    "a prograde encounter can more effectively perturb the disk because the collision effectively lasts longer in the frame rotating with each planetesimal .",
    "we also find prograde collisions which are capable of scattering the disk , and an example of one is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prograde ] . while low inclination",
    "retrograde encounters fail to produce very low inclination objects in the belt , we find that the low inclination prograde close encounters fail to produce low eccentricity objects , requiring subsequent evolution to account for them , including the low eccentricity of neptune itself .",
    "in addition , we have had difficulty identifying a region of parameter space in which a low eccentricity and inclination population is retained but a a significant fraction of the belt is scattered .",
    "we consider what effects subsequent evolution could have on the resulting planetesimal distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : retrograde ] for the retrograde encounter",
    ". scattered objects at high eccentricities that were not placed in resonances with neptune would be quickly removed from the system because they cross neptune s orbit and so could be scattered by neptune .",
    "high eccentricity objects at the location of pluto ( 40au ) would be removed , leaving a population of plutinos which include high eccentricity and inclination objects .",
    "alternatively because there remains a population of low eccentricity objects , subsequent migration by neptune can resonantly capture objects into the 3:2 resonance accounting for the plutinos .",
    "because the low eccentricity objects include objects at high inclinations , the resulting captured plutinos would also include high inclination objects .",
    "the simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : retrograde ] does not necessarily require neptune to migrate to account for the plutinos since non resonant high eccentricity objects at 40 au will be removed by subsequent scattering by neptune .",
    "if we consider models which include neptune s migration , then a closer ( smaller pericenter ) encounter than simulated in fig .",
    "[ fig : retrograde ] would be required .",
    "this follows because low eccentricity objects captured at smaller semi - major axes must include high inclination objects such as are found past 40 au in this simulation .    while no objects are found at extremely low inclinations in the retrograde simulation , ( fig .",
    "[ fig : retrograde ] ) , subsequent evolution may broaden the inclination distribution , reducing the inclinations of some objects .",
    "we began the simulations with zero inclination and eccentricity objects .",
    "had we started the simulation with a distribution of inclinations and eccentricities , the final distribution would have included lower inclination objects .",
    "if the stellar orbit has a higher inclination than the simulation shown in [ fig : retrograde ] , then following the encounter the mean inclination is higher , however more objects remain at low eccentricities , and the eccentricity distribution is narrower .",
    "deep observational searches suggest that the kuiper belt is truncated at 50 au @xcite and does not contain a large population of `` cold '' or near zero eccentricity objects @xcite .",
    "our simulated encounters do not truncate the disk , but instead increase the radial distribution of any previously defined edge ( e.g. as shown by @xcite in similar simulations for the beta pic disk ) .",
    "it is possible that an edge in the kbo distribution existed prior to the stellar encounter . to investigate the effect of this edge , we ran encounter simulations with a a predefined edge at 45 au in the planetesimal distribution prior to the encounter . following the encounter , the planetesimal distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : truncated ] .",
    "the simulated encounter was retrograde with @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath67au .",
    "the resulting planetesimal distribution exhibits a rise in both mean eccentricity and inclinations with semi - major axis for objects past 45 au .",
    "a rise in mean eccentricity is exhibited by the known kbos shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tnos ] , however the known kbo distribution lacks an increase in mean inclination in the region same region .",
    "consequently the observed increase in mean eccentricity with semimajor axis seen in the kbo population is unlikely to be explained by an encounter perturbing a pre - existing disk edge .",
    "since the brightness of an object depends on its distance from the sun to the fourth power , high eccentricity kbo s are more likely to be discovered when they are near perihelion , even taking into account the time they spend at small distances from the sun compared to that spent at large distances .",
    "this selection effect may have reduced the number of known low eccentricity kbos objects at large semimajor axis .",
    "in this paper we have numerically investigated the effect of a close stellar encounter on the primitive kuiper belt .",
    "we have extended our study to collisions with lower mass stars and smaller pericenters than have the pioneering studies of @xcite .",
    "we find that low mass , low inclination encounters can produce a dichotomy in the resulting planetesimal distribution , containing both scattered objects with high eccentricities or high inclinations as well as low inclination and low eccentricity objects , similar to what is seen in the kuiper belt .",
    "in particular a @xmath68 star passing with a pericenter of 45 au from the sun , in a retrograde , highly inclined orbit produces inclination and eccentricity distributions with high end tails , similar to those seen in the kbo distributions .",
    "to more thoroughly test such a scenario it is necessary to numerically evolve the scattered population for the lifetime of the solar system as done for the classical kbo population by @xcite .",
    "high eccentricity objects at 40au which were not placed in resonance with neptune are likely to be removed from the kuiper belt by scattering with neptune .",
    "consequently the 3:2 resonance represents a region of stability ; objects placed in this resonance could stay there for the lifetime of the solar system .",
    "objects placed in this resonance by the encounter could explain the high inclination plutino population",
    ". objects currently residing in resonances that have low capture probabilities such as the 5:2 resonance @xcite might be more naturally explained with a scattering scenario rather than a neptune migration scenario .",
    "alternately one could regard the existence of such objects as a consequence or prediction of the impact scenario explored here .",
    "since long lived regions of dynamical stability differ from those selected by resonance capture , study of future measurements of the of kbo orbital distribution may support or reject a scenario which includes a close stellar encounter .",
    "low eccentricity objects remain in the belt following the encounter , which implies that there remains a population which can be captured into resonance by subsequent migration by neptune ( e.g. , @xcite ) , however neptune s migration may not be needed to explain the highest plutino eccentricities .",
    "this may reduce the extent of migration required by recent migration models @xcite . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the resonant kbo populations might be better explained by neptune s migration into a previously `` hot '' kuiper belt , a situation which could occur after the encounter we have simulated here .    following the stellar encounter",
    ", we expect many objects to be removed from the belt by dynamical evolution , suggesting that there was a period of time when short period comets were produced in great numbers .",
    "one interesting possibility is that this epoch corresponded to the period of `` late heavy bombardment '' when the solar system was a few @xmath69 years old .",
    "this possibility would require a cometary origin for the lunar impacts associated with the late heavy bombardment era ( for further discussion on the cometary vs. asteroidal origin see @xcite ) .",
    "because of the large mass of material likely to be sent into the inner solar system by neptune , this epoch is also very likely to be the time during which neptune migrated . because of the narrowness of neptune s mean motion resonances , a close stellar encounter probably did not occur after the migration of neptune .",
    "this follows because such an encounter would have effectively removed objects from resonance .",
    "the encounter explored here would also place objects in the 2:1 resonance with neptune , and so may not naturally account for the low fraction of twotinos compared to plutinos unless there was a pre - existing edge to the kuiper belt .    while a close encounter with a low mass star could account for the inclination distribution and dichotomy of orbital properties seen in the kuiper belt , as seen in our simulations , it does not truncate the disk . because they pull tidal arms outward , stellar encounters do not tend to sharply truncate disks ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if the kuiper belt contains an edge at 50  au as suggested by @xcite , then it is much more likely to have been caused by a companion , either stellar or planetary .",
    "we note that the encounters simulated here did remove @xmath70 of the planetesimals in the region 3070au objects from the solar system .",
    "the encounter could have ejected a primordial planet at a semimajor axis of @xmath71 au , leaving only its signature behind in the kbo distribution .",
    "if a stellar encounter did perturb the young kuiper belt , then the limits on the likely stellar birth cluster of the sun can be somewhat relaxed from the lower limits placed by @xcite , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "in particular a higher stellar density birth cluster , similar to that in the orion nebula with a few times @xmath72 stars pc@xmath73 @xcite , or a longer lasting open cluster , would be required to make the hypothetical collision explored here probable during the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "the probability @xmath74 , of an object of cross section @xmath75 undergoing a collision while moving through a stellar population of number density @xmath76 , with velocity dispersion @xmath77 km / s during time @xmath78 is @xmath79 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . due to gravitational focusing",
    ", the impact parameter @xmath41 , of an encounter is larger than the pericenter distance @xmath12 . for an encounter with a small pericenter ( when @xmath80 ) , the impact parameter is @xmath81 . for an encounter with the sun with pericenter @xmath82  au , and @xmath83km / s , we estimate a cross section @xmath84 . in the sun s birth cluster",
    "the probability that such an encounter occurred during time @xmath78 @xmath85 we therefore find that a collision proposed here would have been only a moderately improbable event ( 15 percent level ) if the sun were born in a dense cluster similar to that in the orion nebula .",
    "here we have only considered the probability of a close collision and have not restricted the orientation of the encounter with respect to the ecliptic . had we taken into account the narrow region of allowed orbital inclinations and arguments of perihelion",
    ", our proposed encounter would be about 100 times less probable .",
    "the formation time of the kbos ( @xmath86 years ) is longer than that used in the above estimate , @xcite , suggesting that the sun resided in a longer lived and more massive birth cluster , such as an open cluster .",
    "a longer timescale would allow the close encounter to occur after the formation of the kbos .",
    "alternatively the sun could have been part of a wide binary , and the close encounter could have occurred when the binary was disrupted ( e.g. , one of the components of t tauri has just recently been disrupted , see @xcite )",
    ".    currently there are number of examples of young systems which show clear evidence of external perturbers , including the aebe stars hd 141569a which has spiral structure and asymmetries excited by its binary companion hd 141569b , c @xcite , and hd 100546 which exhibits spiral structure which could have been excited by star at a pericenter of about 500 au @xcite .",
    "the tilt in bet pictorus s disk has been explained with an stellar encounter with a similar sized pericenter @xcite .",
    "structure seen in submillimeter emission of older systems have recently been interpreted in terms of high eccentricity outer planets .",
    "for example models for the submillimeter distribution for vega include an outer high eccentricity jupiter mass planet @xcite and that for epsilon eridani include a neptune mass moderate eccentricity planet @xcite .",
    "while the hypothetical encounter with our solar system explored here did not significantly increase neptune s eccentricity , it easily could have , had the incoming star approached the sun from a different orientation .",
    "this suggests a possible scenario which could account for the observed morphology of the the dusty debris disks which require outer eccentric planets .",
