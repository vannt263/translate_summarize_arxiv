    "the behaviors of quantum fields in curved spacetime give hints that , as thermodynamic quantities , spacetime might be an emergent entity , emerging as an effective description of a system that does not contain it .",
    "string theory gives further motivations for this idea ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "not only that , there have been a number of examples in which several dimensions of space emerge @xcite .",
    "what about the emergence of time ? in a theory of quantum gravity `` time '' should also be an emergent concept  there should be an underlying formalism which does not explicitly include a timelike coordinate .",
    "this suggests that the fundamental system is a eucledian or a statistical system . as a step toward understanding the emergence of time",
    ", we can consider a ( heuristic ) analogy with ads / cft correspondence .",
    "if we think of ads / cft as emergence of space from a configuration of branes that are localized in space , then a candidate setting for investigating emergence of time will be branes that are localized in _ time _ @xcite .",
    "this is provided by the unstable branes of bosonic and superstring theory @xcite ( for a fairly recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "see also the initial proposal by sen , where emergent time is viewed as the tachyon field that arises in the effective field theory description of the rolling tachyon @xcite .",
    "the emergence of time in the bosonic d - branes was investigated in @xcite , where the worldsheet description of the brane decay is related to a sequence of points of thermodynamic equilibrium of a grand canonical ensemble of point charges on a circle , the dyson gas .",
    "there , subsequent instants of time are related to neighboring values of the average particle number @xmath1 , and the free energy of the system decreases as @xmath1 increases ( corresponding to later times ) , thus defining a thermodynamic arrow of time . in this letter",
    ", we will extend that work into the case of non - bps branes in superstring theory and find analogous results .",
    "non - bps brane of type ii superstring can be described as the exactly marginal deformation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the time component of the worldsheet fermion and @xmath4 is a chan - paton factor associated with the boundary tachyon .",
    "the worldsheet correlation functions in this background then take the form @xmath5 where the action @xmath6 includes the boundary deformation ( [ eq : deform ] ) and the @xmath7 are vertex operators .",
    "we can adopt convenient gauge choices @xcite , where the dependence on the time component @xmath8 of the bosonic field takes a simple form @xmath9 in the ns - ns sector , and @xmath10 in the r - r sector . here , the spin fields @xmath11 are in the bosonized form .",
    "the virtue of this gauge choice is that we can omit the trivial spatial part of the calculation of the correlations functions and just focus on the temporal part .",
    "the worldsheet correlation function ( [ eq : correlation ] ) can be evaluated by isolating the zero mode @xmath12 from the fluctuations as @xmath13 , and expanding the boundary perturbation @xmath14 in power series .",
    "the results can be written in a form @xmath15 where @xmath16 can be written as a infinite power series of expectation values in circular unitary ensembles @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let us first focus on the disk partition function @xmath17",
    ". the result reads . ]",
    "@xmath18 noticing that the integrand is the haar measure for integration over @xmath19 matrices , giving @xmath20 , we then have the following closed form @xmath21      now we are ready to describe the statistical mechanical system that is dual to the non - bps brane .",
    "consider a gas of charged particles with infinitely heavy masses , confined to live on a unit circle on a two - dimensional plane , the dyson gas .",
    "pairs of these charges , having positions @xmath22 , interact through a two - dimensional coulomb potential , given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the charge of the particles .",
    "consider now a system consisting of two separate subsystems : @xmath25 particles with charges @xmath26 living on a boundary of a two - dimensional disk denoted by @xmath27 , and @xmath28 particles with charges @xmath29 living on a boundary of a different two - dimensional disk denoted by @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , particles living on different disks do not interact .",
    "one can imagine preparing the system with a perfect insulator wall separating the particles into two subsystems .     and",
    "@xmath29 , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    suppose that this system is immersed into a heat bath at inverse temperature @xmath32 .",
    "now we aim to make contact with the disk partition function , by moving to consider the grand canonical ensemble with a particle reservoir with chemical potentials @xmath33",
    ". the grand canonical partition function of this system will then be @xmath34 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left[\\frac{{z_-}^{n_-}}{n_- ! } \\int_0^{2\\pi } \\prod_{i = 1}^{n_- } \\frac{d\\tau_i}{2\\pi } \\ ,",

    "@xmath36 take into account that the system consists of identical particles of two types , and @xmath37 are the corresponding fugacities . at inverse temperature @xmath38",
    "we then obtain @xmath39    comparing ( [ eq : dysoncano ] ) with the open string disk partition function calculation ( [ eq : diskcano ] ) , by setting @xmath40 one finds @xmath41 however , we would like to avoid having complex chemical potentials .",
    "if we want to end up with positive fugacity @xmath42 , a simple remedy is to insert a @xmath43 into the sum ( [ eq : diskcano ] ) , and consider , instead of @xmath44 , the quantity @xmath45 .",
    "the virtue of this that it can be related to grand canonical partition function with positive fugacities .",
    "another way of achieving this is to analytically continue @xmath46 , while keeping @xmath47 positive , so that we have one - to - one correspondence with time @xmath12 of the decaying brane and a positive fugacity , @xmath48      to establish the relation between the non - bps brane and the paired dyson gas , we also need to prescribe how to calculate the worldsheet correlation functions in the dyson gas picture . for clarity , in this subsection",
    "we will explicitly write @xmath49 in favor of @xmath50 .      the statistical dual will correspond to inserting a set of test charges with charges @xmath51 at @xmath52 and another set of test charges with charges @xmath53 at @xmath54 .     at @xmath52 , and @xmath53 at @xmath54 , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to be more precise , let us consider inserting vertex operators in the form of @xmath55 .",

    "in the dyson gas picture , the time of the target spacetime @xmath12 has been replaced by the chemical potential @xmath77 of the statistical system .",
    "different points of thermodynamic equilibrium characterized by different values of the chemical potential correspond to the different instants in time for the decaying non - bps brane .",
    "we can now give an interpretation to time as the average particle number in the statistical system .",
    "the average particle numbers for both sectors of the dyson gases are @xmath78 solving for @xmath12 we get @xmath79    at the past infinity , @xmath80 , we have vanishing fugacity and average particle number",

    "@xmath81 fluctuates around @xmath1 , and the fluctuation is given by @xmath82 at early times , @xmath83 is large , but later @xmath1 becomes more sharply defined .",
    "we can interpret this as a continuous time emerging from an underlying discrete variable @xmath81 in the large @xmath81 limit .",
    "let us consider the grand potential of the statistical system @xmath84 using legendre transformation , we can get the helmholtz free energy @xmath85.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can rewrite @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the shannon entropy .",
    "shannon entropy in the particle number distribution is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the probability that there are @xmath90 positively charged particles on @xmath27-disk and @xmath90 negatively charged particles on @xmath27-disk . since @xmath91 increases as @xmath1 increases , the free energy decrease as @xmath1 increases .",
    "recalling that the increase of @xmath1 marks the passage of time , we can interpret this as a thermodynamic arrow of time .",
    "in this paper , we have reformulated the worldsheet description of non - bps brane decay in terms of the statistical mechanics of the paired dyson gas . as in the case of bosonic d - brane decay ,",
    "the progress of time was marked by the increase of the average number of particles in the gas .",
    "the decrease of free energy marked the passage of time and thus gave rise to a thermodynamic arrow of time .",
    "we would like to emphasize that even though one might have expected a non - equilibrium flow to realize the flow of time , this expectation is somewhat misleading .",
    "this is because there is already a physical time in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "thus , one can not expect to have time emerging from a non - equilibrium statistical mechanical system .",
    "instead , in this set - up , we found that each instant of time was described by a different point of equilibrium in a statistical system .    in the known examples of emergence spatial dimensions",
    ", we learned that the classical or geometrical picture of spacetime is only valid in a certain limit .",
    "here we can also see that it is true , in the sense that the classical geometry of time , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath92 emerges in the limit of large number of particles .",
    "furthermore , we would also like to emphasize that this classical geometry of time does not correspond to a thermal state of the paired dyson gas , but corresponds to the _ whole _ ensemble of the gas ( _ c.f .",
    "_ , black hole does not correspond to the thermal state but the whole ensemble of its microstates @xcite ) .    if the notion of spacetime being emergent is true , then it is a possibility that spacetime symmetries are emergent too . in our case ,",
    "the spacetime picture of the homogeneously decaying unstable d - brane is believed to be supersymmetric at late times , while on the other hand the dyson gas is not .",
    "then , one could ask whether the spacetime supersymmetry must be emergent too and how this is realized in dyson gas language .",
    "this certainly deserves more study .",
