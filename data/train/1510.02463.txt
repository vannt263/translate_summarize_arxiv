    "these features are shown analytically in the appendix .",

    "[ figure4](a ) the resulting dispersion relations , i.  e. , @xmath130 plotted against @xmath131 , for the two transverse branches . in particular",

    "[ figure4](b ) , we plot the corresponding difference in wave number between the left- and right - moving waves as @xmath134 . since @xmath134 is nonzero in a wide frequency range ,",
    "the wave propagation is indeed non - reciprocal in this range .",
    "one - way wave propagation clearly does occur in part of this range .",
    "such propagation occurs when , at particular frequencies , waves can propagate only in one of the two directions . from fig .  [",
    "figure4](a ) , we can see that for the upper dispersion relation , only the right - hand - moving wave can propagate near @xmath135 , whereas for the lower one , only the left - hand - moving wave propagates near @xmath136 . thus , there is a gap in the plot of @xmath134 near @xmath137 , within which there is only one - way wave propagation . in fig .",
    "[ figure4](b ) , the boundaries of the frequency band for one - way propagation are indicated by the two horizontal lines .",
    "the present numerical calculations omit several potentially important factors which could alter the numerical results .",
    "the first of these are the effects of particles beyond the nearest neighbors on the dispersion relations  @xcite .",
    "we believe that these further neighbors will mainly modify the details of the dispersion relations without changing the qualititative features introduced by the magnetic field and the nlc or clc host .",
    "another omitted factor is the ( possibly large ) influence of the particles in disrupting the director orientation of the liquid crystalline host  @xcite , whether nlc or clc",
    ". this could be quite important in modifying the dielectric properties of the host liquid near the particles , and could also cause the positions of the particles themselves to be disturbed , depending on whether they are somehow held in place .",
    "even though these effects could be quite substantial , we believe that the qualitative effects found in the present calculations , notably the regime of one - way propagation found for certain frequencies in a clc host , should still be present .",
    "we hope to investigate these effects in future work .",
    "finally , it is known that radiative damping  @xcite , not included in the quasistatic approximation , can have a significant effect on the dispersion relations at special frequencies . once again , however , we believe that the qualitative effects discussed in this paper should still be present even if radiation damping is included .",
    "thus , we believe that our calculations do qualitatively describe the combined effects of a liquid crystalline host and an applied magnetic field on the surface plasmon dispersion relations .    it should be noted that the magnetic field effects described in this paper are numerically small , for the parameters investigated .",
    "the smallness is caused mainly by the small value of the ratio @xmath29 , taken here as @xmath138 or @xmath115 depending on the electron density used in the calculation . to increase this ratio",
    ", one could either increase @xmath22 ( by raising the magnetic field strength ) , or decrease @xmath20 ( by reducing the free carrier density in the particle ) . for the case of a particle chain in a clc host ,",
    "any change which increases @xmath29 will increases @xmath139 , leading to a broader frequency rage for one - way wave propagation .    in summary",
    ", we have calculated the dispersion relations for plasmonic waves propagating along a chain of semiconducting or metallic nanoparticles immersed in a liquid crystal and subjected to an applied magnetic field . for a magnetic field parallel to the chain and director axis of the nlc ,",
    "a linearly polarized wave is faraday - rotated by an amount proportional to the magnetic field strength . for a clc host and a magnetic field parallel to the chain ,",
    "the transverse wave solutions become non - reciprocal ( left- and right - traveling waves having different dispersion relations ) and there are be frequency ranges in which waves propagate only in one direction .",
    "thus , plasmonic wave propagation can be tuned , either by a liquid crystalline host or a magnetic field , or both . in the future , it may be possible to detect some of these effects in experiments , and to use some of the predicted properties for applications , e. g. , in optical circuit design .",
