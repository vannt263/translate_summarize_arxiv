    "topological invariants have gained considerable interest in solid state physics and related fields through their application to the quantum hall effect  @xcite , topological insulators  @xcite , and more recently , floquet - bloch systems  @xcite . while the relevant topological invariants for the quantum hall effect are the chern numbers of the respective bands of the hamiltonian , the invariants for floquet - bloch systems are constructed for unitary maps that are derived from the time propagator of the periodically driven system .",
    "these invariants , which can be defined generally for unitary maps in odd dimensions  @xcite , can be understood as the generalization of the winding number of a circle map @xmath2 . for floquet - bloch systems in two spatial and one time dimension , the @xmath0 invariant is of primary interest .",

    "we develop an algorithm for the efficient computation of the @xmath0 invariant of general unitary maps , and then provide the application to floquet - bloch systems .",
    "our algorithm is motivated by the algorithm of fukui , hatsugai , suzuki  @xcite , which allows for the direct gauge - invariant computation of chern numbers . however , while the chern numbers depend only on the eigenvectors of the respective bands , we must consider both the variation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the unitary map .",
