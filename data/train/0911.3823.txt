    "in 60s ulam proposed a method to construct a matrix approximant for a perron - frobenius operator of dynamical systems which is now known as the ulam method @xcite .",
    "the ulam conjecture was that , in the limit of small cell discretization of the phase space , this method converges and gives the correct description of the perron - frobenius operator of a system with continuous phase space .",
    "this conjecture was shown to be true for hyperbolic maps of the interval @xcite .",
    "various types of more generic maps of an interval were studied in @xcite .",
    "further mathematical results have been obtained in @xcite with extensions and prove of convergence for hyperbolic maps in higher dimensions .",
    "the mathematical analysis of non - uniformly expanding maps is now in progress @xcite . at the same time",
    "it is known that the ulam method applied to hamiltonian systems with integrable islands of motion destroys the invariant curves thus producing a strong modification of properties of the perron - frobenius operator of the system with continuous phase space ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently it was shown that the ulam method naturally generates a class of directed networks , named ulam networks , which properties have certain similarities with the world wide web ( www ) networks @xcite .",
    "thus the google matrix constructed for the ulam networks built for the chirikov typical map has a number of interesting properties showing a power law decay of the pagerank vector .",
    "the classification of network nodes by the pagerank algorithm ( pra ) was proposed by brin and page in 1998 @xcite and became the core of the google search engine used everyday by majority of internet users .",
    "the pra is based on the construction of the google matrix which can be written as ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) : @xmath2 here the matrix @xmath3 is constructed from the adjacency matrix @xmath4 of directed network links between @xmath5 nodes so that @xmath6 and the elements of columns with only zero elements are replaced by @xmath7 .",
    "the second term in r.h.s . of ( [ eq1 ] ) describes a finite probability @xmath8 for www surfer to jump at random to any node so that the matrix elements @xmath9 .",
    "this term stabilizes the convergence of pra introducing a gap between the maximal eigenvalue @xmath10 and other eigenvalues @xmath11 .",
    "usually the google search uses the value @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath1 is also called the google damping factor . by the construction @xmath13 so that the asymmetric matrix @xmath14 belongs to the class of perron - frobenius operators .",
    "such operators naturally appear in the ergodic theory @xcite and dynamical systems with hamiltonian or dissipative dynamics @xcite .",
    "the right eigenvector at @xmath10 is the pagerank vector with positive elements @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the components @xmath15 of this vector are used for ordering and classification of nodes .",
    "the pagerank can be efficiently obtained by a multiplication of a random vector by @xmath14 which is of low cost since in average there are only about ten nonzero elements in a typical line of @xmath14 of www .",
    "this procedure converges rapidly to the pagerank .",
    "all www nodes can be ordered by decreasing @xmath15 ( @xmath17 ) so that the pagerank plays a significant role in the ordering of websites and information retrieval .",
    "the classification of nodes in the decreasing order of @xmath15 values is used to classify importance of network nodes as it is described in more detail in @xcite .    due to a spectacular success of the google search the studies of pagerank properties became very active research filed in the computer science community .",
    "a number of interesting results in this field can be find in @xcite .",
    "an overview of the field is available in @xcite .",
    "it is established that for large www subsets @xmath15 is satisfactory described by a scale - free algebraic decay with @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the pagerank ordering index and @xmath20 @xcite .    in this work",
    "we analyze the properties of google matrix constructed from ulam networks generated by one - dimensional ( 1d ) intermittency maps .",
    "such maps were introduced in @xcite and studied in dynamical systems with intermittency properties ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a number of mathematical results on the measure distribution and slow mixing in such maps can be find in @xcite ( see also refs . therein ) .",
    "the mathematical properties of convergence of the ulam method in such intermittency maps are discussed in a recent work @xcite .",
    "the analysis of such 1d maps is simpler compared to the 2d map considered in @xcite : for example the pagerank at @xmath21 is described by the invariant measure of the map which can be find analytically as a function of map parameters .",
    "following the approach discussed in @xcite we study not only the pagerank but also the spectrum and the eigenstates of the google matrix generated by the intermittency maps .",
    "indeed , the right eigenvectors @xmath22 and eigenvalues @xmath11 of the google matrix ( @xmath23 ) are generally complex and their properties should be studied in detail to understand the behavior of the pagerank .",
    "we show that under certain conditions the properties of the pagerank can be drastically changed by parameter variation .",
    "the results are presented in a following way : in section ii we describe the class of intermittency maps and the distribution of links in the corresponding ulam network , the spectral properties of the google matrix and pagerank are considered in sections iii and iv , the discussion of the results is presented in section iv .",
