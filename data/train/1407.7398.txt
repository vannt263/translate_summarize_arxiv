    "in recent years , the camassa - holm ( ch ) equation @xcite @xmath0 has attracted much attention in the theory of integrable systems and solitons . since the work of camassa and holm @xcite , various studies on this equation have remarkably been developed @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the ch equation ( [ bch ] ) is that it admits peaked soliton ( peakon ) solutions in the case of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a peakon is a weak solution in some sobolev space with corner at its crest .",
    "the stability and interaction of peakons were discussed in several references @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition to the ch equation being an integrable model with peakon solutions , other integrable peakon models have been found , including the degasperis - procesi ( dp ) equation @xcite whose lax pair , bi - hamiltonian formulation and peakon solutions were discovered in @xcite , the cubic nonlinear peakon equations @xcite , and a generalized ch equation ( gch ) with both quadratic and cubic nonlinearity @xcite @xmath2_x+\\frac{1}{2}k_2(2 m u_x+ m_xu ) , \\quad   m = u - u_{xx},\\label{gch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two arbitrary constants . through some appropriate rescaling , equation ( [ gch ] )",
    "could be transformed to the one in the papers of fokas and fuchssteiner @xcite , where it was derived from the motion of a two - dimensional , inviscid , incompressible fluid over a flat bottom . in @xcite , the lax pair , bi - hamiltonian structure , peakons , weak kinks , kink - peakon interactional and smooth soliton solutions of equation ( [ gch ] )",
    "are presented .",
    "it is an interesting task to study the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional generalizations of the peakon equations .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors provided a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional extension of the ch hierarchy , and they further studied the hodograph transformations and peakon solutions for their ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ch equation . in the present letter , we generalize the gch equation ( [ gch ] ) to the whole integrable hierarchies in ( 1 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 1)-dimensions .",
    "we show that the gch hierarchies admit lax representations and construct a relation between the gch hierarchies in ( 1 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 1)-dimensions .",
    "moreover , we derive the single - peakon solution and the multi - peakon dynamic system for the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gch equation .    the letter is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we review the ch hierarchies in ( 1 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 1)-dimensions . in section 3",
    ", we present the gch hierarchies in ( 1 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 1)-dimensions .",
    "in particular , we give their lax representations . in section 4",
    ", we derive the peakon solutions to the @xmath5-dimensional gch equation . some conclusions and discussions",
    "are drawn in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we review the ( 1 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ch hierarchies presented in @xcite .",
    "the new results we find are a relation between the ch hierarchies in ( 1 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 1)-dimensions and an isospectral lax representations for the ch hierarchies .",
    "let us consider the lenard operators pair @xcite @xmath6 the lenard gradients @xmath7 are defined recursively by @xmath8 taking an initial value @xmath9 , one may generate the negative ch hierarchy @xcite @xmath10 for @xmath11 , ( [ chh ] ) becomes @xmath12 which is nothing but the ch equation ( [ bch ] ) with @xmath1 @xcite . for @xmath13 , we arrive at @xmath14 in what follows , we call equation ( [ chh2 ] ) the @xmath15-nd ch equation . for the general @xmath16 , we refer to ( [ chh ] ) as the @xmath16-th ch equation .",
    "in @xcite , the authors proposed a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ch equation @xmath17 in general , a @xmath5-dimensional generalization of the ch hierarchy could be written as @xcite @xmath18 in @xcite , the authors also studied the hodograph transformations and the peakon solutions of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ch equation .",
    "let @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 is the eigenparameter and @xmath22 is defined through equation ( 4 ) .    by a direct calculation",

    ", we recover the lax pair of the well - known ch equation ( [ bch ] ) with @xmath1 @xcite @xmath26 as @xmath13 , we obtain the lax pair of the @xmath15-nd ch equation ( [ chh2 ] ) @xmath27    it has been known that there exist some relations between integrable models in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions and ones in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions .",
    "for example , assembling of the first two 1 + 1 dimensional non - trivial members in the akns hierarchy : the coupled nonlinear schrdinger equation and the coupled mkdv equation , yields the well - known ( 2 + 1)-dimensional kp equation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the compatible solution of the first two members in the kdv hierarchy produces a special solution of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional sawada - kotera equation @xcite-@xcite . here in our paper",
    ", we have some similar results listed as follows .",
    "let @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be a compatible solution of the ch equation ( [ chh1 ] ) and the 2-nd ch equation ( [ chh2 ] ) .",

    "if @xmath31 is a compatible solution of the ch equation ( [ chh1 ] ) and the @xmath16-th ch equation ( [ chh ] ) , then the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ch hierarchy ( [ chh3d ] ) has a special solution @xmath31 .",
    "the above proposition immediately yields the following corollary .    the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ch equation ( [ ch3d ] ) possesses a lax triad @xmath24 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
