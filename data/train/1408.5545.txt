    "the pioneering works on hybrid ( also called mixed - hybrid ) finite element methods are due to pian @xcite and fraejis de veubeke @xcite for the numerical solution of linear elasticity problems . here the term  hybrid \" , as stated in @xcite , means  the constraints on displacement continuity and/or traction reciprocity at the inter - element boundaries are relaxed a priori \" in the hybrid finite element model .",
    "one may refer to @xcite and to @xcite respectively for some developments of hybrid stress ( also called assumed stress ) methods and hybrid strain ( also called enhanced assumed strain ) methods based on generalized variational principles , such as hellinger - reissner principle and hu - washizu principle . in @xcite , stability and convergence",
    "were analyzed for several 4-node hybrid stress / strain quadrilateral / rectangular elements .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the analysis of hybrid methods for 4th order elliptic problems , and to @xcite for the analysis for second - order elliptic boundary - value problems .",
    "one may see @xcite for more references therein on the hybrid methods .",
    "due to the relaxation of function continuity at the inter - element boundaries , the hybrid finite element model allows for piecewise - independent approximation to the displacement / potential or stress / flux solution , thus leading to a sparse , symmetric and positive definite discrete system through local elimination of unknowns defined in the interior of the elements .",
    "this is one main advantage of the hybrid methods .",
    "the process of local elimination is also called  static condensation \" in engineering literature . in the discrete system ,",
    "the unknowns are only the globally coupled degrees of freedom of the approximation trace of the  displacement \" or  traction \" defined only on the boundaries of the elements .    in @xcite cockburn et .",
    "al .  introduced a unifying framework for hybridization of finite element methods for the second order elliptic problem : find the potential @xmath2 and the flux @xmath3 such that @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a polyhedral domain , @xmath6^{d\\times d}$ ] is a matrix valued function that is symmetric and uniformly positive definite on @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . here",
    "hybridization denotes the process to rewrite a finite element method in a hybrid version .",
    "the unifying framework includes as particular cases hybridized versions of mixed methods @xcite , the continuous galerkin ( cg ) method @xcite , and a wide class of hybridizable discontinuous galerkin ( hdg ) methods . in @xcite three new kinds of hdg methods , or more precisely ldg - h ( local dg - hybridizable ) methods , were presented , where the unknowns are the approximations of the potential @xmath2 and flux @xmath3 , defined in the interior of elements , and the numerical trace of @xmath2 , defined on the interface of the elements . in @xcite",
    "an error analysis was carried out for one of the three hdg methods by @xcite , based on the use of a projection operator inspired by the form of the numerical traces of the methods . following the same idea as in @xcite ,",
    "a unifying framework was proposed in @xcite to analyze a large class of methods including the hybridized versions of some mixed methods as well as several hdg methods .",
    "we note that in @xcite , a reduced hdg scheme was proposed , which only includes the potential approximation and numerical trace as unknowns . recently",
    "this hdg method was analyzed in @xcite for the poisson problem .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a family of hdg methods for problem .",
    "we use piecewise polynomials of degree @xmath10 for both the numerical flux @xmath11 , and the numerical trace @xmath12 of @xmath2 , and use piecewise polynomials of degree @xmath1 for the numerical potential @xmath13 .",
    "it should be mentioned that , in @xcite , the same methods have been analyzed for convection diffusion equations with constant diffusion coefficient and linear elasticity problems , respectively .",
    "we note that in our analysis the diffusion coefficient @xmath6^{d\\times d}$ ] is a matrix valued function . by following a similar idea of @xcite",
    ", we establish error estimates for the numerical flux and potential under the minimal regularity condition , i.e. @xmath14 this is significant since the regularity @xmath15 may not hold for @xmath16 for practical problems . to our best knowledge , such a kind of error estimation has not been established for hdg methods , yet .",
    "we note that in @xcite an error estimate was established under the condition that @xmath15(@xmath16 ) , while the estimate with @xmath17 is fundamental to the multi - grid method developed there . in our contribution",
    ", we also construct a local postprocessing for the flux , which produces a numerical flux @xmath18 with better conservation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ hdg - method ]",
    "we follow the general framework in @xcite to describe the corresponding hdg methods .",
