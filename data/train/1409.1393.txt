    "there are two strands of literature for modeling credit risk , namely , the structural firm value model originated by black and scholes @xcite and merton @xcite and the reduced - form model by jarrow and turnbull @xcite . in the classical firm value",
    "approach the asset value of a firm is described by a geometric brownian motion and the default is triggered when the asset value falls below a given default barrier level . in the reduced - form intensity - based approach ,",
    "defaults are modeled as exogenous events and their arrivals are described by using random point processes and the default time is a totally inaccessible stopping time .    the fundamental idea behind the paper dates back to the seminal paper by duffie and lando [ 5 ] where a concrete example is given to show how a reduced - form model can be obtained from a structural model by restricting the information structure .",
    "they consider a noisy and discretely observed firm asset value in a continuous - time setting , where the firm asset value is given by a diffusion process .",
    "this idea and associated mathematical issue has been studied by eillott , jeanblanc and yor @xcite , guo , jarrow and zeng @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in these papers that it is possible to transform a structural model with a predictable default time into a reduced - form model , with a totally inaccessible default time , by introducing `` incomplete information '' .    however , most of the papers focus on one dimensional diffusions , while less attention has been placed to the correlation structure in the incomplete information model with multiple firms .",
    "giesecke @xcite proposes a model of correlated multi - firm default with incomplete information .",
    "bond investors can observe issuers assets and defaults , but not the default threshold levels which are only revealed at times of default .",
    "stochastic dependence between default events is induced through correlated asset values and correlated default thresholds .",
    "we study the correlation structure in an incomplete information framework with asset values of firms being driven by a two - dimensional correlated brownian motion and with known default threshold levels .",
    "the available information set includes the periodic asset value reports and the default times which are totally inaccessible stopping times to the market participants .",
    "we can transform the original structural model into a reduced - form intensity - based model and find the correlation structure of the two firms under such a transformation .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is that we investigate the transformation from a structural model to reduced - form model with `` incomplete information '' on multiple correlated assets , provide the analytical expression for the conditional distribution of the default time , and prove the existence of the intensity process of default times , together with its explicit form .",
    "this paper sheds some new lights on the form of suitable intensity processes for portfolio credit risk .",
    "our findings show that it is more reasonable to consider a contagion model , in which interacting intensities are time - varying with decaying default impacts ( @xcite ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present our model framework and give our main result : the default intensity process characterizing the correlation structure of the two firms . in section 3",
    "we illustrate our results by some numerical examples . in section 4",
