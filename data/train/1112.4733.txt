    "optical quantum - memories @xcite based on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite are a very active research area .",
    "specifically , storage of classical light pulses @xcite and of single photons @xcite was demonstrated .",
    "in addition , different polarizations of light were stored either using extended atomic level schemes @xcite or by converting the polarization into other degrees of freedom before storage @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of applications envisioned for quantum memories requires that quantum entanglement is first generated between two or more particles and that the quantum states of one or several of these particles are subsequently stored in a quantum memory .",
    "the crucial point is that this entanglement must survive the storage .",
    "recently , this aspect was experimentally demonstrated in three independent experiments @xcite .    here",
    "we report in detail on the performance of the quantum memory used in one of these experiments @xcite .",
    "the experiment uses an @xmath3rb bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) to realize a quantum memory for the polarization qubit of a single photon . a raman scheme based on eit",
    "is used to implement storage and retrieval of the photon .",
    "the atomic level - scheme is extended to allow for storage of the photonic polarization qubit in two atomic spin states .",
    "quantum process tomography is used to determine the process fidelity which quantifies how well the polarization is maintained during storage .",
    "in addition , the decay of the process fidelity with increasing storage time is monitored .",
    "all experiments reported here use classical light pulses instead of single photons , thus profiting from count rates which are much higher than in ref .",
    "these increased count rates yield a more precise value of the process fidelity . ref .",
    "@xcite reports that storage and retrieval cause no discernible deterioration of the fidelity of the entangled state within an error bar of several percent .",
    "the present experiment still observes a process fidelity compatible with unity , but now with an error bar that is an order of magnitude smaller , thus demonstrating more clearly the capabilities of the bec as a quantum memory .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a single @xmath3rb atom in an optical high - finesse cavity was used to generate a triggered single photon in such a way that the photon s polarization qubit is entangled with the spin state of the single atom .",
    "this unparalleled source is combined with the bec that serves as a quantum memory for the single photon .",
    "the bec is well suited for this purpose because the absence of thermal motion allows for long storage times , the large optical depth allows for high write - read efficiencies , and excellent internal - state preparation allows for high - fidelity storage of a qubit in atomic spin states .",
    "the experiment thus combines two different systems , each ideally suited for its purpose .",
    "the resulting hybrid character of the system poses an experimental challenge because the dipole traps that hold the single atom and the bec in place have depths of several millikelvin and several microkelvin , respectively . due to the resulting ac - stark shifts",
    ", the single photons generated from the single atom are blue detuned by typically 70 mhz relative to the free - space atomic resonance , whereas the ac - stark shifts experienced by the bec are negligible on this scale . in the present paper ,",
    "we therefore experimentally study the efficiency of light storage in the regime of 70 mhz single - photon detuning .",
    "the regime of much larger single - photon detunings has been studied theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite before , but those results are not immediately applicable to our system .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section [ sec - implementation ] describes the experimental implementation , sec .",

    "this makes it possible to store the probe - light polarization qubit in the qubit space spanned by the atomic states @xmath11 . ]",
    "eit employs a control light beam to manipulate the propagation of a probe light beam inside a medium .",
    "light storage in eit - based schemes relies on the fact that the group velocity of the probe light @xmath12 can be reduced compared to the vacuum speed of light @xmath13 by many orders of magnitude @xcite by choosing a small value for the control intensity . upon entering the medium ,",
    "the temporal duration of the probe pulse remains unchanged , whereas its spatial length is drastically reduced due to the small group velocity . a pulse which in vacuum is much longer than the medium",
    "can thus be fully compressed into the medium .",
    "once the pulse is fully inside the medium , one can ramp the control intensity to zero in an adiabatic fashion . in our experiment , we implement an approximately linear , temporal ramp of the control intensity which lasts 30 ns .",
    "this is sufficiently adiabatic according to ref .",
    "this ramp reduces @xmath12 all the way to zero and the pulse is stopped inside the medium .",
    "the pulse is stored for a time @xmath14 which can be chosen freely .",
    "after this , we ramp the control intensity back on and the pulse resumes its propagation @xcite . during the storage time @xmath14",
    ", the pulse exists in the medium in the form of an atomic spin wave . if the light pulse is compressed such that it fits inside the medium , then the spin wave stores the longitudinal and transverse shape of the light pulse .",

    "figure [ fig - beam - path ] shows a simplified scheme of the optical beam path .",
    "an @xmath3rb bec serves as a quantum memory .",
    "the bec is illuminated by @xmath10-polarized control light propagating along the @xmath18 axis with a waist ( @xmath19 radius of intensity ) of @xmath20 @xmath21 m which is much larger than the thomas - fermi radii of the bec so that the control light intensity can be approximated as constant across the bec .",
    "in addition , the bec is illuminated by probe light propagating along the @xmath22 axis focused to a waist of 8 @xmath21 m .",
    "this is comparable to the thomas - fermi radii so that the probe beam samples some fraction of the transverse inhomogeneity of the bec . to obtain a well - defined transverse mode for the probe light before impinging onto the bec",
    ", the light is sent through a single - mode fiber .",
    "the polarization of the probe light can be @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or any superposition thereof .    after storing and retrieving the probe light",
    ", we need to measure its polarization . to this end",
    ", the beam path ends with a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) cube and two identical detectors , one in each output port of the pbs .",
    "a quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) followed by a half - wave plate ( hwp ) , both placed right in front of the pbs allow for the selection of an arbitrary polarization basis . as detectors",
    ", we use photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) in this paper , instead of the avalanche photodiodes that we used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "stray light is an issue in our setup .",
    "much of it is eliminated using mechanical shielding and temporal gating of the detector signals .",
    "the remaining stray light is dominated by control light off - resonantly scattered from the bec during the retrieval of the probe pulse .",
    "this stray light level would be unproblematic for the measurements presented here , but the experiments reported in ref .",
    "@xcite required a substantial suppression . in the beam path from the bec to the detectors",
    ", our setup therefore includes a single - mode optical fiber for transverse mode filtering and a filter cavity for spectral filtering .",
    "the spatial filtering with the single - mode fiber makes use of the fact that storage and retrieval have little effect on the transverse mode of the probe light , whereas the control light is off - resonantly scattered from all positions in the bec and into all directions .",
    "the fiber reduces the stray light power that reaches the detector by a factor of 0.068 . in the absence of the bec , the fiber reduces the probe light power by a factor of 0.66 .",
    "hence , the fiber increases the signal - to - background ratio by one order of magnitude .",
    "storage and retrieval in the bec compromise the transverse mode of the probe beam slightly .",
    "this causes an additional reduction of the probe light power by a factor of 0.88 at the single - photon resonance and by a factor of 0.80 for a single - photon detuning of @xmath23 mhz .",
    "in addition , the fiber suppresses the excitation of higher transverse modes in the subsequent filter cavity .",
    "the filter cavity is a near - planar , plane - concave fabry - perot resonator with a finesse of 180 and a free spectral range of 40 ghz .",
    "the cavity has a transmission of 0.8 at the resonance , which is tuned to the probe light frequency .",
    "we expect that the scattered eit control light is either elastically scattered or raman scattered , thereby transferring an atom from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . hence , we expect the scattered light to be red detuned from the probe light by either 6.8 ghz or 13.6 ghz .",
    "transmission through the cavity suppresses the light power for each of these frequencies by a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "the cavity length is stabilized against long - term drift with a piezo actuator using a pound - drever - hall technique with light at a wavelength of 830 nm .",
    "this light is overlapped with the probe light on a dichroic mirror in front of the mode - filtering fiber .",
    "the 830 nm light transmitted through the filter cavity is separated from the probe light using another dichroic mirror behind the filter cavity . a small fraction of the 830",
    "nm light keeps propagating towards the detectors .",
    "this light is removed with dielectric interference filters which are not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - beam - path ] .",
    "in addition , the 830 nm light source is turned off during any time intervals where relevant detector signals are expected .",
    "the optical fiber for stray - light filtering is not polarization maintaining because it must work equally well for all possible input polarizations .",
    "hence , the polarization after transmission through the fiber is related to the input polarization by a unitary transformation . as long as the fiber is not moved mechanically or exposed to temperature changes ,",
    "this transformation is temporally stable .",
    "the same applies to the polarization transformations caused by the filter cavity , by the dichroic mirrors , and by other mirrors in the beam path which are not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - beam - path ] .",
    "we compensate the resulting overall transformation using two qwps followed by a hwp  a combination which can generate any unitary transformation .",
    "we produce an almost pure bec in the hyperfine state @xmath27 , using radio - frequency ( rf ) induced evaporative cooling in a magnetic trap , as described in ref .",
    "the gas is transferred into a crossed - beam optical dipole trap operated at a wavelength of 1064 nm .",
    "the measured trap frequencies are @xmath28 hz with gravity pointing along the @xmath29 axis . a magnetic hold field of @xmath30 g applied along the @xmath22 axis preserves the spin orientation of the atoms .",
    "we use two consecutive microwave pulses , each with a pulse area of @xmath10 , to transfer the population into the internal state needed for our eit level scheme . starting from state @xmath31 , the first pulse transfers the population into state @xmath32 .",
    "subsequently , the second pulse transfers the population to state @xmath33 . the total process transfers @xmath34 % of the atoms into state @xmath33 .",
    "atoms left in the @xmath25 hyperfine states are then removed with blast light .",
    "this is followed by temporary application of a strong magnetic field gradient which removes atoms with @xmath35 from the shallow optical dipole trap .",
    "after this procedure , the total atom number in undesired internal states lies below the detection limit of our setup which we estimate to be @xmath36 atoms .",
    "for the rest of the experiment , the magnetic hold field is reduced to typically 0.1 g. at this point , the bec typically contains @xmath37 atoms .",
    "the corresponding thomas - fermi radii are @xmath38 @xmath21 m .",
    "we now study how well the polarization of the probe light is maintained during storage . the probe beam propagates along the @xmath22 axis .",
    "hence , an arbitrary incoming polarization state can be expanded as @xmath39 with coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 . with the atomic level scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - levels ] , this state is mapped onto the atomic state @xmath42 .",
    "the retrieval process maps the atomic state back to the original polarization state . in our experiment ,",
    "both mapping processes work extremely well , but magnetic field noise causes a deterioration of the state for long storage times .",
    "we apply a magnetic hold field of @xmath43 g and orient it along the @xmath22 axis .",
    "this suppresses undesired transitions between different zeeman states caused by components of the magnetic - field noise perpendicular to the @xmath22 axis . in sec .",
    "[ sub - qubit - faraday ] we discuss the faraday rotation caused by this hold field . in sec .",
    "[ sub - qubit - tomography ] we use quantum state tomography to characterize the deterioration of the polarization for long storage times and show how techniques that reduce the magnetic - field noise improve the performance of the system .",
    "the polarization of the probe light can be characterized using the stokes parameters @xcite    [ stokes ] @xmath44    where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 denote the intensity detected after a polarizer that transmits only one polarization , namely horizontal @xmath48 , vertical @xmath49 , diagonal ( @xmath50 ) @xmath51 , anti - diagonal ( @xmath52 ) @xmath53 , right circular @xmath54 , or left circular @xmath55 .",
    "here , @xmath54 and @xmath55 correspond to @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the stokes parameters can be regarded as the components of a four - dimensional stokes vector .",
    "@xmath56 describes the total intensity , whereas the three - dimensional vector @xmath57 describes the polarization of the light and is well suited for graphical visualization , in close analogy to the bloch vector .",
    "we call @xmath58 the poincar vector .",
    "its unit sphere is called poincar sphere .",
    "the magnetic hold field along the @xmath22 axis gives rise to a faraday rotation of the poincar vector around its @xmath22 axis at an angular frequency @xmath59 where @xmath60 mhz / g is the bohr magneton and @xmath61 is the land factor .",
    "for the levels used in our experiment @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the total rotation angle of the poincar vector @xmath64 has one contribution @xmath14 from the storage time with the control light off and another contribution @xmath65 which is the delay of the probe pulse caused by the propagation through the medium of length @xmath55 with the control light on .",
    "note that the rotation of the polarization vector of the electric field in real space is a factor of 2 slower than the rotation of the poincar vector .",
    "figure [ fig - faraday ] shows experimental data of this faraday rotation for a linear input polarization .",
    "the line shows a fit of a sinusoid with gaussian damping @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the @xmath68 damping time , where @xmath69 is given by eq .  , and where @xmath70 represents the input polarization .",
    "the best - fit values are @xmath71 mhz , yielding @xmath72 g , and @xmath73 ms .    a careful inspection of the experimental data points for long times in fig .",
    "[ fig - faraday ] leads us to an interesting observation , revealing the physical origin of the damping . unlike the best - fit curve",
    ", the data points , which represent a single experimental shot each , do not show a decrease of the peak - to - peak amplitude .",
    "instead , they are noisy insofar as they do not form a smooth sinusoid .",
    "we attribute this to irreproducible , temporal fluctuations of @xmath74 , which effectively scatter the data points along the horizontal axis .",
    "only if we were to average several experimental shots to represent their mean value , would we observe a reduction of the peak - to - peak values in the experimental data .",
    "a fit of @xmath75 to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig - faraday ] with @xmath76 @xmath21s yields a best - fit value of @xmath77 .",
    "the fact that @xmath53 is consistent with 1 shows that temporal fluctuations of @xmath74 on a time scale of 20 @xmath21s or faster have no discernible effect",
    ". temporal fluctuations of @xmath74 on slower time scales manifest themselves in our experiment only as shot - to - shot fluctuations of @xmath78 \\int_0^{t_\\mathrm{store}+\\tau_d(l ) } dt \\linebreak[1 ] b_z(t)$ ] . in our experiment ,",
    "each shot requires the preparation of a new bec , which takes 20 s. this suggests that shot - to - shot fluctuations of @xmath74 probably yield an important contribution to the shot - to - shot fluctuations of @xmath69 .",
    "we now turn to a complete characterization of the effect which the storage and retrieval process has on the polarization . as the process does not conserve the total intensity , a full description of the process must use the four - dimensional stokes vector , not just the three - dimensional poincar vector .",
    "we consider the regime of small probe intensity .",
    "hence , the dependence of the stokes parameters @xmath79 of the retrieved probe pulse on the stokes parameters @xmath80 of the incoming probe pulse can be approximated as linear @xmath81 @xmath82 is called mller matrix @xcite .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - beam - path ] , we use a pbs with detectors behind both output ports . according to eq .",
    ", a full characterization of the stokes vector requires such measurements for 3 different settings of the wave plates in front of the pbs , which select the measurement basis .",
    "this set of 3 measurements fully characterizes the quantum state of the polarization and it can be regarded as quantum _ state _ tomography @xcite .    to determine @xmath82 experimentally , we use a set of 4 linearly independent input stokes vectors ( e.g. , @xmath48 , @xmath51 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 ) and perform quantum state tomography of the output state generated for each input state .",
    "this set of 12 measurements allows for a complete determination of @xmath82 and it can be regarded as quantum _ process _ tomography @xcite .",
    "performing such quantum process tomography , we find that in our experiment the mller matrix is always well approximated by @xmath83 where @xmath69 is the angle resulting from the faraday rotation , @xmath84 is a damping factor , and @xmath85 is the write - read efficiency which is experimentally found to be independent of the input polarization .",
    "above , we concluded from fig .",
    "[ fig - faraday ] that the polarization at short storage times is essentially pure , whereas at long storage times shot - to - shot fluctuation of @xmath69 must be taken into account .",
    "hence , each individual shot can be described by some realization of @xmath82 as in eq .   with @xmath86 and with some value of @xmath69 which exhibits shot - to - shot fluctuations .",
    "we assume that the values of @xmath69 have a gaussian distribution with root - mean - square ( rms ) width @xmath87 .",
    "averaging over many shots yields eq .",
    "with @xmath88 .    to develop a simple model for the dependence of @xmath84 on @xmath14 , we assume that only shot - to - shot fluctuations of @xmath74 contribute to the fluctuations of @xmath69 , i.e.  we approximate @xmath74 as constant during each individual shot . with this approximation , the values of @xmath74 will have a gaussian distribution with rms width @xmath89 and with @xmath90 , where we neglected @xmath91 .",
    "this yields @xmath92 with @xmath93 for a linearly polarized input state , eqs .   and reproduce eq .  .",
    "the faraday rotation is a unitary evolution . for",
    "any given @xmath14 , its effect can be compensated , e.g. , using wave plates and it is therefore not much of a concern .",
