    "there is a long - lasting debate whether be stars belong to a high velocity end of a single distribution suited to all ms b stars , or they form a stellar group with a separate high - velocity distribution . to obtain answer elements to this question",
    ", we corrected the @xmath0 for gravitational darkening effects ( frmat et al .",
    "2005 ) , calculated the inclination angle @xmath1 and derived masses and ages of 127 program be stars using models of stellar evolution with rotation ( meynet & maeder 2000 , zorec et al .",
    "2005 ) . to derive the respective zams true equatorial velocities",
    "we have taken into account four main phenomena determining the variation of the surface rotation with age ( meynet & maeder 2000 ) : 1 ) the equatorial radius - dependent changes ; 2 ) variations due to angular momentum - loss through mass - loss events ; 3 ) variations carried by internal density distribution changes with age and rotation , which affect the stellar inertial momentum ; 4 ) meridional circulation and other hydrodynamical instabilities that produce internal angular momentum redistribution with time scales of the order of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the kelvin - helmholtz time and @xmath4 0.9 is the ratio of centrifugal to gravitational acceleration .",
    "we note that @xmath5 is the equatorial velocity the star acquires after its rapid initial short - lasting re - arrangement of the internal angular velocity law @xmath6 .",
    "this re - arrangements last no more than 1 to 2% of the stellar ms life ( denissenkov et al .",
    "1999 , meynet & maeder 2000 ) and transforms an initial entirely rigid rotation into another differential one where the stellar core has a faster angular velocity than the equator .",
    "the transformation of individual @xmath0 parameters into @xmath5 is shown in fig .",
    "the most striking feature in this figure is the neat cut depicted by the regression line obtained from the @xmath7 in each mass - interval . according to this finding",
    ", no be star is seen below the cutting line .",
    "this indicates that stars need an initial velocity @xmath8 @xmath7 in order to become be at any moment in the ms evolutionary phase . in each mass - interval",
    "we divided the @xmath5 by the corresponding @xmath7 and formed the global histogram shown in fig .",
    "the fit that better describes the distribution obtained is a gaussian tail .",
    "we note that under the histogram there must be roughly 17% of stars out of the whole ms b - type star population .",
    "more than 80% of b - type stars must then be gathered into the @xmath9 @xmath10 interval .",
    "it may then happen that be stars do not form a separate distribution , but possibly a gaussian - like tail of a more general distribution of rotational velocities that encompasses the whole ms b - type star population .",
    "we note that some b stars without emission lines , of which a non negligible proportion is in the lower mass - extreme ( @xmath11 ) is represented by bn stars , which distribute over both velocity intervals .",
    "bn stars with @xmath12 might then never become be , while those with @xmath13 could probably do .",
