    "extensions of general relativity can contribute to achieve a comprehensive cosmological picture by giving a geometrical interpretation of the dark side @xcite .",
    "although general relativity is accurately bounded at the solar system scales @xcite , several cosmological indications seem to point out the need of extending the hilbert - einstein action in order to achieve a comprehensive and self - consistent description of the universe expansion history , i.e. at far infrared scales @xcite . rephrasing it differently ,",

    "varying the action with respect to the metric is not the only choice .",
    "it is also possible to vary with respect to the affine connection , considering it independent from the metric itself @xcite .",
    "this is the so called _ palatini approach _ that produces different field equations .",
    "the advantage of the latter approach is that field equations remain of second order @xcite .",

    "this means that the matter stress - energy tensor @xmath22 depends on the metric @xmath3 and matter fields @xmath23 , and their derivatives with respect to the levi - civita connection of @xmath3 .",

    "a strategy to derive the particle production rate in curved space is to fix a background with a constant curvature i.e. @xmath33 .",
    "this situation is usually named as the _ de - sitter phase _ @xcite . from the above field eqs .",
    "( [ field_eq ] ) , it is easy to derive an effective cosmological constant term @xmath34 , which , in principle , depending on the value of @xmath32 , can give rise to an accelerating expansion phase @xcite .",
    "the choice of @xmath32 allows to simplify the calculations thanks to the symmetries of de sitter spacetime . in order to constrain the form of @xmath0 function ,",
    "a method is to fix the range of free parameters by the transition to different vacuum states .",
    "such a procedure relies on the definition of the bogolubov coefficients . to define them ,",
    "let us consider the quantization on a curved background .",
    "since we are considering modified theories of gravity , a model where a scalar field @xmath35 is non - minimally coupled to geometry , i.e. @xmath36 can be assumed .",

    "as we said before , @xmath0 theories and any extended theory can be recast as general relativity with some non - minimal coupling and a further contribution in the stress - energy momentum tensor ( see @xcite for the general procedure ) . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the bogolubov transformations in the context of homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies , in order to define the rate of particle production and then to constrain the functional form of @xmath0 gravity .",

    "this property is extremely relevant since it allows to consider the bogolubov transformations for different gravitational backgrounds . for the purposes of this work , we limit to the case of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "as we said , the simplest choice to construct the bogolubov transformations is assuming a de sitter phase with a constant curvature @xmath32 . a spatially flat friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) conformal metric is @xcite @xmath64 where we adopted the conformal time @xmath65 , which varies in the interval @xmath66 . introducing a scalar field @xmath67 depending on @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the corresponding klein - gordon equation eq .",
