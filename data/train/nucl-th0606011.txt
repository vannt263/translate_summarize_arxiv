    "the internuclear potential is one of the most important ingredients in describing heavy - ion reactions .",
    "the double folding model ( dfm ) [ 1,2 ] has been widely used in order to construct it microscopically .",
    "this model uses the sudden approximation i.e. , the assumption that the density of each colliding ion is kept at all distances during the collision .",
    "the effect of nucleon exchange between the colliding nuclei is partly taken into account in this model through the so called knock - on exchange potential . since it does not fully include the exchange effect , the saturation property of nuclear matter is respected only partly .",
    "since heavy - ion fusion reactions probe the region inside the coulomb barrier , where the projectile and target nuclei appreciably overlap with each other , the effect of saturation plays an important role [ 3 ] .",
    "there is actually a model for internuclear potential which consistently takes account of the saturation property of nuclear matter . that is the energy density formalism ( edf ) [ 4 - 10 ] , firstly proposed by brueckner et al .",
    "this model constructs the internuclear potential from an energy functional for a dinucleus system .",
    "earlier studies have shown that this method can account for the elastic scattering of @xmath0o+@xmath0o reaction [ 4 ] and the experimental barrier height for many systems [ 5 ] .",
    "brink and stancu have investigated intensively the applicability of this method using the skyrme energy functional [ 6 - 8 ] .",
    "they also showed that the edf potential is consistent with the proximity potential .",
    "a similar conclusion was also obtained in ref .",
    "[ 9 ] using a higher - order thomas - fermi approximation for the kinetic energy and spin orbit densities .",
    "more recently , the edf was applied to the simplified coupled - channels calculations for heavy - ion fusion reaction at sub - barrier energies [ 10 ] .    in this contribution",
    ", we apply the edf to heavy - ion fusion reactions and perform the full order coupled - channels calculations . in particular , we analyze the fusion reactions of @xmath0o with @xmath1@xmath2sm,@xmath3w and @xmath4pb .",
    "we also discuss the effect of saturation property on the fusion cross section at energies close to , and well below , the coulomb barrier for @xmath5ni+@xmath5ni fusion reaction , for which the so called steep fall - off phenomenon was recently reported [ 11 ] .",
    "in the energy density formalism , the internuclear potential is assumed to be given by an energy density for the dinuclear system consisting of the target and projectile nuclei . if one takes the frozen density approximation , it is given as @xmath6\\qquad\\quad\\quad\\nonumber \\\\",
    "-\\varepsilon[\\rho^{(p)}_p(\\vec{r}),\\rho^{(p)}_n(\\vec{r } ) ]    -\\varepsilon[\\rho^{(t)}_p(\\vec{r},\\vec{r}),\\rho^{(t)}_n(\\vec{r},\\vec{r})]\\}\\,\\ , d\\vec{r}.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath7 $ ] is the energy density functional , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the proton ( p ) and neutron ( n ) density distributions of the projectile ( p ) and target ( t ) nuclei , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 represents the density whose center is at @xmath11 . the first term in eq.(1 ) represents the total energy of the system when",
    "two ions are separated by distance @xmath12 , while the second and the third terms are the ground state energy of each ion . in this contribution",
    ", we use the skyrme functional for @xmath7 $ ] . see refs . [",
    "6,12,13 ] for its explicit form .",
    "we estimate the kinetic energy and spin orbit densities in the semi - classical extended thomas - fermi approximation [ 9,14 ] . in this way , the internuclear potential is entirely determined by the density distributions for the colliding nuclei . we evaluate them with the skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) method using the same parameter set of the skyrme interaction as",
    "that we employ for calculating the internuclear potential .",
    "the pairing correlation is taken into account in the bcs approximation with the constant gap approach .",
    "we take @xmath13 for this purpose .",
    "we fit the shf density with a modified fermi function in evaluating the internuclear potential according to eq.(1 ) .",
    "we introduce an overall scaling factor to the potential obtained in this way so as to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "we now apply the edf to the reactions of @xmath0o with @xmath1@xmath2sm,@xmath3w and @xmath4pb . in the following calculations",
    ", we use the skm * parameter set [ 15 ] .",
    "this parameter set gives the incompressibility of nuclear matter which is close to the experimental value [ 14 ] and has been successfully used for the description of ground state properties for many nuclei .",
    "the channel coupling does not play so important role at energies above the coulomb barrier .",
    "we therefore first perform the single - channel calculation for each system by ignoring nuclear intrinsic excitations and determine an overall normalization factor of the edf potential in order to reproduce the experimental fusion cross sections at high energies . in order to facilitate the coupled - channels calculations , which are essential at energies below the coulomb barrier",
    ", we simulate the surface region of the resultant potential by woods - saxon form . the normalization factor @xmath14 , the optimum woods - saxon parameters @xmath15 , and the corresponding coulomb barrier height @xmath16 for each system are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we notice from table 1 that the edf potential provides the surface diffuseness parameter @xmath17 of around , which is similar to the result of double folding model [ 2 ] and is almost independent of the system .    in performing the coupled channels calculations",
    ", we introduce the excitation operator for the intrinsic excitation , through the radius parameter of the target nucleus in the standard way .",

    "the ground state rotational band up - to the @xmath21 and @xmath22 member of the @xmath19sm and @xmath3w , respectively , is taken into account .",
    "we determine the deformation parameters by fitting to the experimental fusion cross sections .",
    "the resultant deformation parameters are @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath19sm , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for @xmath3w .",

    "+ we next study the fusion reactions with spherical target nuclei , that is @xmath0o+@xmath2sm and @xmath4pb reactions .",
    "we include the couplings to the @xmath29 and @xmath30 vibrational states in @xmath2sm and to the @xmath30 and @xmath31 states in @xmath4pb .",
    "we estimate the deformation parameters from the experimental b(e2 ) , b(e3 ) and b(e5 ) values .",
    "the excitation energies and deformation parameters are @xmath32 mev , @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath2sm and @xmath35 mev , @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath4pb .",
    "the results of the coupled channels calculations are compared with the experimental data in fig .",
    "we see again that the present calculations well reproduce the experimental data of the fusion cross sections for both systems .",
    "we next discuss the effect of incompressibility of nuclear matter on the fusion cross section .",
    "we are especially interested in the connection between the nuclear incompressibility and the steep fall - off problem at deep sub - barrier energies .",
    "we therefore choose the fusion reactions of two @xmath5ni nuclei , whose fusion excitation function shows the steep fall - off problem [ 11 ] .",
    "figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) show the total potential and the nuclear potential for this system obtained with edf using three different skyrme parameters .",
    "the solid , dashed , and dotted lines have been obtained with siii ( @xmath38=355.4 mev ) [ 20 ] , and skm * ( @xmath38=216.7 mev ) [ 15 ] parameter sets , respectively .",
    "one observes in fig .",
    "3(b ) that the nuclear potential tends to be shallower and more repulsive with increasing incompressibility .",
    "the fusion excitation function slightly reflects these differences as shown in figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) .",
    "a more important observation in connection with the steep fall - off problem is that the nuclear potential , hence also the total potential , have a much shallower depth at the potential minimum compared to the corresponding potentials given by the double folding model ( dfm ) irrespective to the choice of the force parameters .",
    "the dfm using the m3y force and the same densities as those in the present edf does not actually show a potential pocket , and the depth is as large as @xmath39 mev and @xmath40 mev for the nuclear and total potentials , respectively .",
    "the edf using the skyrme force yields a shallow potential irrespective to the parameter sets , because the nuclear saturation property is taken into account to some extent for all of them .",
    "interestingly , as shown in fig.3(a ) , the minimum energy of the potential pocket nearly equals to that discussed by misicu and esbensen [ 3 ] , who modified the dfm by adding a repulsive term in order to explain the steep - fall off phenomenon .",
    "the minimum position , which is about 80 mev in the present calculation , is comparable to energy @xmath41 87 mev , where the data of the fusion excitation function start to fall steeply .",
    "ni+ @xmath5ni reaction calculated with three different skyrme forces . figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) show the fusion cross sections obtained with these potentials . ]",
    "we have performed the coupled - channels calculations based on the edf for reactions .",
    "we have shown that our calculations reproduce well the experimental data of the fusion excitation function as well as the fusion barrier distribution for these systems .",
    "also , using @xmath5ni+@xmath5ni reactions , we have shown that the edf potential given by the skyrme energy density has a much shallower depth than the standard dfm and suggested that the nuclear saturation property may provide an origin of the steep fall - off phenomenon at deep sub - barrier energies .    in the present studies",
    ", we employed the frozen density approximation , where the total density of the system is simply given by the sum of the densities of the projectile and target nuclei .",
    "this approximation leads to the unphysically high density matter when two colliding nuclei completely overlap and may break down inside the coulomb barrier .",
    "this problem can be , at least partly , resolved by respecting the pauli principle , i.e. the role of antisymetrization in the calculation of the densities of two colliding nuclei [ 6,22 ] .",
    "another problem which should be examined is the adiabaticity of the fusion reactions .",
    "the frozen density approximation implies that the reaction takes place suddenly .",
    "however , it is not obvious whether the sudden approach holds to a good approximation for the reactions at low energies .",
    "the opposite limit is the adiabatic approximation , where the densities of the colliding ions change dynamically at every instant .",
    "the edf can accommodate both limits in a natural way , and is suited to examine the adiabaticity of the reactions . in connection with the steep fall - off problem , it is an interesting question to see at what energy the present sudden approximation breaks down and whether the potential minimum still remains shallow even if one goes beyond the sudden approximation .",
    "a work towards these directions is now in progress .",
