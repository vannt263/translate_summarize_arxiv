    "understanding the complex roles and behaviors of electronic spin in matter has grown increasingly desirable as technological trends move towards materials and devices based on ever stricter control and utilization of the spin degree of freedom .",
    "combined spin- and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( spin - arpes ) represents a powerful method of directly probing the spin physics of the energy and momentum dependent electronic systems of current research interests.@xcite while electron spectroscopies such as angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) have been developed into precise , successful , and widespread techniques,@xcite spin - resolved versions comparatively suffer due to the large inefficiencies inherent to spin polarization measurements.@xcite despite the long - standing instrumental difficulties , numerous groups very recently have been re - illustrating the exciting potential of spin - arpes for high impact research in the current science climate ( e.g. refs .  ) .",
    "works such as these add further urgency for developing improved spin - arpes instrumentation .",
    "the primary difficulty in such efforts is the lack of a direct way to measure the spin of free electrons .",
    "current polarimeters must function through various spin dependent effects in scattering electrons from a variety of targets and extracting their spin polarization as a differential intensity measurement.@xcite the most widely used polarimeters are variants of the mott - polarimeter,@xcite in which the spin - orbit interaction introduces an asymmetry in the rate of backscattering into opposite directions dependent on the spin of the incident beam .",
    "unfortunately , the cross sections for these scattering events at the incident kinetic energies necessary for useful spin asymmetries ( 20 - 100 kev ) are extremely low , resulting in several orders of magnitude decreased efficiency compared with straightforward spin - integrated intensity measurements.@xcite other types of polarimeters based on the spin - orbit interaction obtain similar performances@xcite ( for a review of spin - orbit polarimeters , see ref .  ) .    in general , spin - arpes",
    "requires a spectrometer combining both a spin polarimeter and an electron energy ( and angle ) analyzer ( eea ) . as much of the vast advancements in present high - resolution arpes",
    "have been based on the popular hemispherical energy analyzers ( hea),@xcite the most common spin - arpes setup combines a mott - polarimeter with an hea.@xcite indeed this is the type of spectrometer used for most of the recent high profile works.@xcite the working principle of an hea is the chromatic dispersion of an electron beam along a spatial dimension .",
    "a significant part of the hea s effectiveness is its compatibility with parallel 2-dimensional ( 2d ) multi - channel detection along two spatial directions , corresponding to energy and one angular photoemission direction.@xcite however , as available spin polarimeters operate as effective single - spatial - channel detectors , the combined instrument loses this key characteristic and operates as a serial single - channel analyzer .",
    "compared to current spin - integrated hea spectrometers , the mott - hea spectrometer is hindered by the single - channel acquisition of energy ( and angle ) itself , as well as the inherent inefficiency of the single energy ( and angle ) channel provided by the mott - polarimeter .",
    "experiments are then forced to operate with significantly compromised energy and angle resolutions for adequate count rates .",
    "we have developed a spectrometer at the advanced light source ( als ) in berkeley aimed at achieving a much improved ( @xmath1100x ) total efficiency compared to the mott - hea spectrometer , thus allowing spin - arpes to be performed with the improved resolutions desired for current spin - dependent research .",
    "this is achieved through two significant differences with respect to the mott - hea : ( 1 ) spin - resolution is provided by a higher efficiency low - energy exchange - scattering ( lex ) polarimeter , and ( 2 ) energy analysis is performed with the time - of - flight ( tof ) technique to achieve parallel multi - channel energy detection .",
    "two distinct modes of operation , a straight electron flight path and one which includes a 90@xmath0 `` quarter - sphere '' bandpass filter ( bpf ) , uniquely enhances the spectrometer s general utility as well as its ability to achieve high energy resolution with a wide range of light sources .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii outlines the design concepts and operating principals of the new spin - arpes spectrometer , including the tof - eea scheme , its integrated 90@xmath0 bpf , the lex polarimeter and its design optimizations , and the detection and data acquisition electronics .",
    "section iii provides a detailed report of the spin - integrated performance of the tof - eea as well as initial spin - resolved measurements with the full spectrometer carried out at beamline 12.0.1 of the als operating in 2-bunch mode .",
    "section iv gives a concluding discussion .",
    "although the mott - hea spectrometer combination seems to be the most popular , the strong desire for improved performance for spin - arpes experiments has driven numerous and significant alternate approaches .",
    "most of these have involved the development of different combinations of eeas and polarimeters , some of which are illustrated by the ven diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : ven ] . each combination",
    "is represented by the overlap of the circles denoting the energy and spin alnalysis technique , with each overlap being labeled by approximate efficiency gains with respect to the mott - hea combination ( which is therefore labeled _ 1x _ ) .",
    "one general approach has been to replace the mott - polarimeter with a lex - type polarimeter .",
    "here we use the term to collectively describe polarimeter developments ( e.g.  ) which utilize the spin - dependent specular reflectivity of ferromagnetic surfaces@xcite at energies of @xmath210 ev and below . the reflectivity s dependence on the relative alignment of the incoming electron s spin polarization and surface magnetization directions",
    "can be applied to spin polarimetry for nearly 100 times improved efficiency with respect to mott - polarimeters.@xcite these improvements are due mainly to the higher average reflectivity of surfaces at such low energy compared to the total cross sections used at the higher energies of mott - polarimeters . in several of these cases ,",
    "the given lex - type polarimeter has been combined with an hea@xcite ( or similarly with a cylindrical sector analyzer@xcite ) for performing spin - resolved experiments .",
    "if electrons are efficiently transported from the hea to the polarimeter in these cases , one expects a significant improvement ( @xmath2100x ) in total spectrometer efficiency .",
    "although the scattering target preparation and characterization is more involved than with mott - polarimeters,@xcite the large improvement in effective count rate is well worth it for experiments requiring high resolution . as discussed in section  [ sec : spinpol ] , advances in passivation of the reactive target surfaces may aid the long term stability of a lex polarimeter , improving its convenience .",

    "the combinations are represented by the overlapping circles , and are labeled by the approximate efficiencies relative to the mott - hea combination ( explained in text ) .",
    "the combinations on the left , top , and bottom have been previously developed . a spectrometer based on the combination on the right , marked by the green arrow ,",
    "is reported here.,width=264 ]    another alternative approach has been to keep the mott - polarimeter , but replace the hea with a tof - eea .",
    "the tof technique resolves photoelectron kinetic energy by measuring the time it takes to travel from its point of origin to final detection .",
    "excellent descriptions of the tof technique and various tof - eeas are given in refs .  .",
    "by moving energy resolution from the chromatic dispersion of electrons along a _ spatial _ dimension ( as in the hea ) to the _ temporal _ dimension , multi - channel energy detection can be obtained even with effective single - spatial - channel polarimeters .",
    "recognizing the significant advantage of the parallel energy detection , several groups have developed successful spin - arpes spectrometers based on integrating mott - polarimeters into tof - eeas for use at bessy,@xcite the als,@xcite and more recently at the esrf@xcite and elettra.@xcite specifically , comparing the efficiency of a single channel hea with a tof - eea in acquiring spin - resolved data with the same energy resolution ( @xmath3 ) across the same width energy window ( @xmath4 ) , the tof approach can be a factor @xmath5 times more efficient , assuming similar electron transmission in both systems.@xcite the larger this ratio , the greater is the benefit of the tof - eea .",
    "a direct experimental comparison of the efficiencies of a mott - tof and mott - hea spectrometer is well presented in ref .  .",
    "the above mentioned groups using this type of spectrometer were interested in spin - polarized core levels and auger lines and required measuring wide energy ranges which made the tof approach quite suitable .",
    "the primary focus of the current instrument is high energy resolution within a narrower energy window containing the low - energy physics near e@xmath6 ; @xmath5 is still quite large in this case as @xmath3 is smaller .",
    "for example , for studying a 1 ev energy window with 10 mev energy resolution , a tof - eea represents a 100-fold increase in data acquisition speed .",
    "a significant caveat of the tof technique for such arpes experiments is the additional requirement of a pulsed light source with appropriate timing structure .",
    "third generation synchrotron light sources , such as the als , are pulsed sources with adequate time resolution , however usually operate at too high a repetition rate ( e.g. 500 mhz at the als in `` multi - bunch mode '' ) for high resolution tof measurements ( see below ) . therefore ,",
    "tof - based spectrometers typically operate during periods of reduced repetition rate ( @xmath23 mhz at the als during `` 2-bunch mode '' ) which allow high resolution tof measurements , but translates to lower average photon flux ( @xmath210x at the als ) .",
    "this must be taken into account when considering overall experiment efficiency . in the example",
    "above , a tof spectrometer used during 2-bunch mode at the als is then a factor of @xmath210 times more efficient than a single channel hea spectrometer used during multi - bunch mode .",
    "this is the source of the _",
    "10x _ label in the tof - mott overlap region in fig .",
    "[ fig : ven ] .",
    "when comparing these approaches for use with light sources such as uv laser systems,@xcite high - harmonic generation ( hhg ) laser systems,@xcite or free - electron lasers ( fels)@xcite which may already have the required time structure , the issue of reduced flux is no longer a consideration , and the tof - based spectrometer becomes even more ideal . as advanced time - resolved pump - probe style experiments@xcite require such light sources and time structures independent of the spectrometer , they benefit from the full tof efficiency gain .",
    "while these different combinations have already been realized , fig .",
    "[ fig : ven ] suggests that the most efficient spectrometer would be one which integrates a lex - polarimeter within a tof - based analyzer . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this approach has not been previously developed . to make use of the large combined efficiency gains of this arrangement ,",
    "we have developed a spin - resolved , tof - based spectrometer ( spin - tof ) with this approach.@xcite      electron spin polarimeters function by taking advantage of spin - dependent scattering processes and precisely measuring the magnitude of an asymmetry in the intensity of scattered electrons with respect to a particular scattering parameter.@xcite the polarization measurement is reduced to a differential intensity measurement in which the unknown polarization of the incident electron beam along a given axis , @xmath7 , is proportional to the measured normalized intensity asymmetry , @xmath8 , between two distinct scattering channels , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the proportionality is generally expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , the effective sherman function , quantifies the analyzing power of the given scattering process and must be known beforehand in order to be used for polarimetry .",
    "the statistical error in the polarization measurement can be simplified as@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total intensity of the beam measured in the two scattering channels , @xmath15 is the intensity of the incident electron beam , and @xmath16 is the total acquisition time ( i.e. the total number of incident electrons is given by @xmath17 ) . in discussing the efficiency of a given polarimeter ,",
    "one often defines the `` figure of merit '' @xmath18 as @xmath19 such that equation  [ eqn : deltap ] can be rewritten as @xmath20 expressed in this way , one can see that achieving a given statistical certainty in a polarization measurement requires a factor @xmath21 more time than a simple integrated intensity measurement of the same incident beam ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "therefore , a primary goal of polarimeter design is the maximization of @xmath18 .",
    "the systematic error in the polarization measurement due to uncertainty in @xmath12 can be expressed as@xcite @xmath23 error due to instrumental intensity asymmetry that is unrelated to spin polarization@xcite can be approximately expressed as@xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the measured intensity asymmetry with an unpolarized incident beam .",
    "these additional sources of error further emphasize the importance of a large sherman function for spin polarimetry . while additional measurements made by reversing the polarization of the source can sometimes be performed to aid in removing instrumental asymmetry from a polarization measurement,@xcite",
    "minimal @xmath25 is preferred and essential for experiments which do not allow for the reversal of source polarization.@xcite    the most widely utilized mechanism for spin - dependent scattering in spin polarimetry has been the spin - orbit interaction,@xcite the most prominent example of which is the mott polarimeter.@xcite in a mott polarimeter , sizable values of @xmath12 are found at scattering energies between 20 - 100 kev where cross sections in general are low .",
    "hence , mott polarimeters currently in use typically have values of @xmath26 with total efficiencies of @xmath27.@xcite these low values of @xmath18 are a primary source of difficulty in spin - resolved experiments .",
    "mott polarimeters do allow a convenient target ( typically au foil ) for a stable @xmath12 over long time scales .",
    "however they can also be quite sensitive to beam alignment , often leading to significant values of @xmath25 which can be difficult to deal with.@xcite    recently there has been a number of groups developing lex spin - polarimeters that instead of spin - orbit coupling utilize the exchange interaction in low - energy scattering from ferromagnetic surfaces.@xcite the exchange interaction introduces a dependence in the reflectivity of a target surface on the relative orientation of the polarization of the incident beam and the target s magnetization . these polarimeters make use of the resulting asymmetry in the intensity of the specularly reflected beam upon reversing the target s magnetization direction .",
    "equation  [ eqn : mainpol ] is then applied with @xmath9 and @xmath10 being successive intensity measurements with the target magnetization reversed , and @xmath7 being the incident beam s polarization component along the target magnetization axis .",
    "measurement of an unknown polarization through this technique again requires prior knowledge or calibration of @xmath12 .",
    "one of the exciting reasons for developing this type of polarimeter is that various target systems provide similar ( or higher ) values of @xmath12 as mott polarimeters , but at scattering energies @xmath28 ev where the average scattering cross section is significantly higher .",
    "thus values of @xmath29 are much improved resulting in a larger @xmath18 ( equation  [ eqn : fom ] ) .",
    "specifically , reported values of @xmath12 have ranged from @xmath20.20@xcite to @xmath20.40@xcite while those of @xmath18 have ranged from @xmath30@xcite ( this value includes efficiency of coupling to the energy analyzer ) , to @xmath31@xcite , to as high as @xmath32.@xcite    the strong exchange induced spin - dependence in low energy scattering from ferromagnetic surfaces had been proposed@xcite and experimentally studied@xcite several decades ago , and further suggested to be taken advantage of in efficient polarimeter development@xcite not long after . a lex - polarimeter achieving an efficiency of @xmath33 was indeed developed and coupled to a hea for spin - resolved arpes experiments as early as 1990.@xcite the more recent increase of interest in lex - polarimeter development@xcite is likely reflective of the current surge in importance of spin - resolved experimental capabilities .    in order to take advantage of the significantly higher values of @xmath18 , we developed a unique version of the lex - polarimeter capable of integration into a tof - eea .",
    "in addition to fast time - resolution , the present design focuses on versatility to handle both a wide array of suitable scattering targets and experimental geometries .",
    "the primary components are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sd ] .",
    "the electron beam to be spin analyzed enters a tube which passes through the center of a rear - facing multichannel plate ( mcp ) detector assembly and strikes the target surface , @xmath250 mm downstream , at near normal incidence . the specular ( 0,0 ) reflected beam is then collected by the front of the mcp detector , and fast output pulses marking the time of electron detection events are processed and recorded . the scattering target s magnetization",
    "is switched in - situ by the coils along the target s `` y '' axis ( @xmath34 in fig .  [",
    "fig : sd ] ) ; the polarimeter is then sensitive to the incident spin component along this axis .",
    "a histogram of electron arrival times is built with the target magnetized in both directions .",
    "the resulting asymmetry is then used to measure the spin polarization ( via equation  [ eqn : mainpol ] ) of the incoming beam as a function of arrival time .",
    "the time - resolution is required for the polarimeter s integration into a tof - eea ( section  [ sec : tofeea ] ) .",
    "( color online ) drawing of the lex polarimeter scattering and detection components .",
    "mcp detector with annular tube is shown in sectioned view .",
    "electron path is shown by red dashed line .",
    "the inset shows two useful scattering geometries ; the main figure shows polarimeter configured in the planar geometry with the scattering plane coplanar with the @xmath35 plane.,width=321 ]    the electron detector utilizes a chevron pair of 27 mm effective od multichannel plates ( mcps ) with a 6 mm annular hole.@xcite the mcp output is collected by a single anode disk , also with annular hole , coaxial with the mcps , and the signal output is immediately capacitively decoupled by a second plate separated from the anode by a 0.005 \" kapton film .",
    "in contrast to channeltron detectors , the short charge transit distance through the 12 micron pores , @xmath361.5 mm thick mcp stack , and signal output coupling scheme provide fast , @xmath361 ns rise - time pulses capable of @xmath36 200 ps time - resolution ( discussed in section  [ sec : daq ] ) . the detector geometry is rotationally symmetric about the incident beam axis , allowing the target and scattering plane to be arbitrarily rotated by an angle @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sd ] ) , resulting in the reflected beam being recorded by a different but geometrically equivalent spot of the same detector . the target assembly including the magnetization coils are mounted on a differentially pumped rotary platform to provide this rotation , thus enabling the polarimeter to be sensitive to spin along any axis within the plane normal to the incident beam , while keeping a fixed scattering geometry and therefore a constant @xmath12 .",
    "this is distinct from the designs for multiple - axis sensitivity of other lex polarimeters : the design of okuda _ _ et al.__@xcite provides two fixed axes accessed by separate detectors , while the design of winkelmann _ _ et al.__@xcite provides continuous rotation of the target and magnetization axis about the target surface normal , thus altering the scattering geometry and possibly @xmath12 .",
    "while lex polarimeters take advantage of the exchange interaction , there are finite spin - orbit induced effects when scattering from heavy ferromagnets such as gd,@xcite and even from light ferromagnets such as fe.@xcite two scattering geometries , depicted in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : sd ] , are often used for isolating and studying the exchange and spin - orbit interactions in scattering from crystals ; the particulars of these geometries are well discussed in the literature.@xcite it is not clear that there is a significant difference between the two in terms of polarimeter performance , however details of the two remain interesting .",
    "briefly , the ` planar ' geometry , which is also shown utilized in the polarimeter schematic , has the target magnetization in the scattering plane , while the ` perpendicular ' geometry has it perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "although other lex polarimeters seem to use the latter , we have initially used the former as the exchange and spin - orbit interactions are more completely isolated.@xcite in this case the axis sensitive to exchange effects ( the magnetization axis ) is perpendicular to the axis sensitive to spin - orbit effects ( the scattering plane normal , @xmath38 ) .",
    "for example , in the perpendicular geometry , interference effects between the spin - orbit and exchange interactions can lead to a measured asymmetry even with an unpolarized incident beam .",
    "this can be pictured as the result of a double - scattering : in the first , there is a spin - orbit induced polarization along @xmath38 , followed by an exchange induced intensity asymmetry in the second .",
    "this effect is removed in the planar geometry .",
    "one should note that spin - orbit effects are not completely removed in the planar geometry , as interference can lead to the spin - orbit interaction first rotating the component of the incident polarization within the scattering plane , thus slightly altering the magnitude of the in - plane component s projection along the target magnetization .",
    "as both effects are higher order , they should in general be small .",
    "we also note that the present detector geometry allows a much smaller angle of incidence ( only @xmath39 compared to other polarimeters at @xmath40@xcite ) which may slightly improve @xmath12 and @xmath18,@xcite as well as reduce any spin - orbit effects even further ( the spin - orbit interaction in the specular reflection must reduce to zero at normal incidence ) . if necessary",
    ", it is straightforward to switch between the two geometries by simply changing the tilt direction of the target within the target and magnet coil assembly ; again this flexibility is accommodated by the circular detector geometry .",
    "the volume within the polarimeter , from the entrance tube to the scattering target , is maintained as a field free region .",
    "as the lex scattering is typically most efficient at kinetic energies below 10 ev , this region is very sensitive to magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , special attention was paid to ensure minimal magnetic fields through the use of double - walled magnetic shielding and the strict use of non - magnetic materials within the shields . the magnetic target itself and its magnetizing coils present possible difficulties . using thin ferromagnetic films with in - plane",
    "magnetization direction grown on nonmagnetic substrates helps reduce stray fields from the target itself to a minimum .",
    "the coils are a double set of helmholtz coils ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sd ] ) : the inner pair has half the radius and 4 times the number of turns as the outer pair , and are connected in series in opposing directions .",
    "the field in the center at the target position due to the inner pair is 8 times stronger than the outer pair , resulting in a net field strong enough to reverse the magnetization of the target films ( @xmath2100 g ) .",
    "the approximate dipole fields far from the coil pairs , however , are the same magnitude and thus mostly cancel at the distance of the magnetic shielding .",
    "these design aspects minimize changes in stray magnetic fields after magnetization switching that could lead to spurious @xmath25 and error in polarization measurements ( equation  [ eq : instr ] ) .",
    "indeed the polarimeter measures an extremely small @xmath25 ( section  [ sec : spin ] ) .",
    "of course the most important component of a lex polarimeter is the target system itself . as a number of systems",
    "have been used and suggested , and many more can be imagined , we have included a dedicated small and efficient multi - use preparation chamber capable of preparing a wide range of target surfaces and transferring them directly into the polarimeter in constant uhv .",
    "the chamber includes a stage for target annealing and high temperature flashing , a quartz crystal monitor , an e - beam evaporator , and a precision gas leak valve .    for initial work ,",
    "thin co(0001 ) films grown on a w(110 ) substrate were used due to the potential of high values of @xmath12 ( 0.40 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath32 ) of ultrathin films ( @xmath25 monolayers).@xcite in general , w(110 ) is a straightforward substrate to clean for epitaxial film growth , and aged films can be quickly ` flashed ' off to start fresh .",

    "[ fig : spleem ] ) which has available majority states , but which is still in a minority bandgap which enhances the reflectivity of incident minority spins .",

    "it is possible that an fe(001 ) surface will give increased performance in the current polarimeter , as previous lex polarimeters have shown great performance with this surface.@xcite as the exchange split bandgap of this surface also falls at a higher kinetic energy ( 6 - 10 ev ) than the present co(0001 ) surface , the related peaks in @xmath12 and @xmath18 fall at these higher kinetic energies and are likely more convenient to use .",

    "the described lex polarimeter could provide a variety of experimental systems with enhanced performance and efficiency with respect to more traditional mott polarimeters . in the particular application of spin - arpes where energy and angular resolution are also required , we have fully integrated the polarimeter into the multifunction tof - eea described below .          commercially available heas are often the starting point in developing mott - hea spectrometers . indeed",

    "tof - eeas are less common , however , and one with the characteristics required for the present project and compatible for use with the als 2-bunch mode light specifications ( @xmath23 mhz repetition rate ) required a fully custom design .",

    "[ fig : main ] , illustrating the basic layout of the resulting tof - eea .",
    "the design includes two modes of operation with distinct electron flight paths and detectors . in the first mode ( m1 ) , electrons photoemitted from a sample by pulsed photons ( far right ) enter the first electrostatic lens system ( ls1 ) and are transported along a nominally straight path through to a second lens system ( ls2 ) where they are finally detected by a time - resolved detector ( far left ) . in the second mode ( m2 ) , photoelectrons exiting ls1 are electrostatically deflected 90@xmath0 by a nested pair of spherical electrodes and transported through a third lens system ( ls3 ) and focused onto another time - resolved detector ( bottom ) . as only photoelectrons of energies within a certain range around a nominal energy ( e@xmath48 )",
    "are successfully passed through the 90@xmath0 bend , it acts as a bandpass filter ( bpf ) , allowing only the desired section of a photoelectron spectrum to be detected in this mode .",
    "a downstream variable exit slit ( es ) aids in the removal of scattered and secondary electrons generated in the bpf .",
    "a variable entrance aperture ( va ) at the front of ls1 ( with a selectable diameter of 2 , 4 , 6 , or 8 mm ) defines the angular acceptance , and therefore the angular resolution , of the spectrometer which ranges from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "two sets of quadrupole deflectors within ls1 allow for corrections of the photoelectron beam path due to misalignment of the photon beam and sample with respect to the spectrometer or small stray magnetic fields .",
    "the two distinct modes provide convenient flexibility in measurements .",
    "although detectors can be swapped , the primary configuration has a simple , single - anode high - speed mcp assembly for spin - integrated measurements at the end of ls2 for m1 operation , and the lex - polarimeter ( section  [ sec : spinpol ] ) for spin - resolved measurements at the end of ls3 for m2 operation .",
    "as we will see below , m2 operation with the 90@xmath0 bpf ( along with the polarimeter ) provides for efficient , high energy resolution measurements over a certain range of the photoemission spectrum and with a wide range of photon energies .",
    "even with the high efficiency lex - polarimeter , such spin - resolved measurements are more time consuming than straightforward spin - integrating detection .",
    "thus the ability to operate in m1 for rapid , lower resolution ( higher flight energy ) , full spectrum acquisition of spin - integrated data is very convenient for system alignment , initial characterization and crystalographic alignment of the sample under investigation , and identifying sections of the spectrum where high energy- and spin - resolution is desired .",
    "switching between the two modes of operation takes a matter of seconds .    as the goal of the project is to provide high energy resolution for efficient and practical spin - resolved measurements ,",

    "[ eq : en ] shows that the energy resolution ( @xmath3 ) has a contribution due to the total timing resolution ( @xmath53 ) of @xmath54 it is clear that @xmath55 is dependent on the flight energy .",
    "thus the electrostatic lens columns are utilized to retard the photoemission spectrum to lower flight energies for high energy resolution , largely independent of initial photoelectron kinetic energy ( i.e. photon energy ) while maintaining high transmission for the portion of the spectrum of interest ( e.g. refs .  ) .",
    "this is in general reasonably practical with retardation ratios ( the ratio of initial photoelectron kinetic energy to retarded average flight energy ) of on the order of 10 or less .",
    "one should note that for use with low photon energy laser sources , the photoelectrons are emitted at such low kinetic energies that the lens columns can instead be used to slightly accelerate the spectrum to more manageable flight energies .",
    "the total timing resolution can be written as a combination of the excitation source pulse width ( @xmath56 ) , the resolution of the final detector ( @xmath57 ) , the resolution of the assorted electronics and data acquisition components used ( @xmath58 ) , and any timing aberrations along the accepted flight paths of the eea ( @xmath59 ) as @xmath60 . in the case of current synchrotron",

    "@xmath59 , in part due to differences in flight path lengths , can be kept to a minimum ( @xmath3650 ps ) in the present tof - eea design such that they do not significantly add to the overall effective @xmath53.@xcite while energy resolution is inversely proportional to flight length , space and other constraints limited the size of the instrument to a reasonable choice of @xmath62 m . from equation  [ eq : dt ]",

    "an important consideration is the possible overlap of lower ( higher ) energy electrons created by earlier ( later ) photon pulses reaching the detector at the same time .",
    "this temporal overlap of a photoemission spectrum greatly complicates the extraction of real energy spectra , and needs to be avoided .",
    "the problem is illustrated in fig .",

    "the vertical black bars in panel ( a ) mark the times of successive photon pulses with the corresponding flight energies as labeled .",
    "as the detector can not distinguish electrons which arrive at time @xmath16 from those at time @xmath72 ns ( where @xmath73 is an integer ) , the measured time spectrum will be the sum of each part of the curve in the upper panel separated by the vertical black lines .",
    "this is shown in panel ( b ) where each section is translated back ( @xmath74 ) ns ; the measured spectrum is the sum of each of these curves .",
    "this shows the relative weight of counts at a given time channel originating from the different possible energies .",
    "for example , the total intensity measured at @xmath75 ns is made up of 89.3% 50 ev electrons , 6.0% 8.22 ev , 1.5% 3.23 ev electrons , etc . thus , if one is interested in studying part of a spectrum with a flight energy of 50 ev , the measured time spectrum will be noticeably overlapped by photoelectrons at flight energy @xmath28 ev and 3 ev .",
    "further , if the section of interest of the photoemitted spectrum is transported at lower flight energies ( possibly after retardation for improved resolution ) , the situation is worse .",
    "if the electrons of interest are measured at 8.22 ev flight energy , for example , the ratio of desired intensity at 220 ns to that of lower energy electrons is further reduced .",
    "more severe is the overlap with higher energy photoelectrons ( if present in the originating spectrum ) with a flight energy of 50 ev , as they will be proportionally much more intense in the time spectrum .",
    "even if one is interested in photoelectrons near the fermi level , the much smaller number of photoelectrons at higher energies due to higher - order light at synchrotron sources can cause serious overlap problems ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : enres ] and discussion in section  [ sec : energy ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that overlap problems are less restrictive using a shorter flight path . from equation  [ eq : en ] , reducing @xmath51 decreases the lowest energy , @xmath64 , which will arrive at the detector within the first 328 ns .",
    "electrostatic retardation will need to be increased accordingly to maintain the same energy resolution ( equation  [ eq : dt ] ) .",
    "while this approach may reduce spectral overlap issues , the increased retardation required will result in decreased electron transmission and overall efficiency , which could be prohibitive for low count rate experiments such as spin - resolved measurements .",
    "spectral overlap can be completely removed with the incorporation of spatially dispersive elements , such as the 90@xmath0 bpf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : main ] ) , to remove photoelectrons of unwanted flight energies . in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : overlap ] , if one is interested in studying a portion of the photoemission spectrum with a flight energy of @xmath2 8 ev for high energy resolution , one can utilize m2 .",
    "the bpf will pass only electrons within an energy range about the desired @xmath76 ; any overlapping electrons at flight energies of 3 and 50 ev are not transmitted to the final detector .",
    "while the spatial dispersion of electrons within the bpf is used to coarsely filter the spectrum , the temporal dispersion through the entire flight path is still used for parallel detection and resolution of electron energies within the passed energy window .",
    "the present design provides a typical bandpass of @xmath2 1 ev . as discussed above , parallel detection with @xmath3=10 mev across an energy window of @xmath4=1 ev represents a @xmath5=100 times increase in efficiency with respect to serial detection , assuming equal electron transmission and photon flux . in the context of high resolution spin - arpes measurements , such as for the study of strongly correlated electron systems ( e.g.  refs .  ) , acquisition of a 1 ev window around e@xmath6 or some other particular spectral feature is all that is typically required . for taking spectra of wider energy ranges , the voltages of the tof - eea",
    "can be incrementally adjusted to ` sweep ' the window passed by the bpf across the energy range desired .",
    "thus , the tof - eea with the integrated dispersive bpf is a powerful combination for performing high resolution ( low flight energy ) tof spectroscopy with light sources of higher energy and/or repetition rates than would otherwise be possible .",
    "for example , this analyzer allows for high - resolution spectra to be taken with typical synchrotron light sources ( and/or laser sources ) with photon energies ranging from @xmath26 ev to as high as several hundred ev and repetition rates as high as @xmath210 mhz .",
    "the 90@xmath0 bpf offers additional benefits in the context of spin - resolved measurements . as discussed in section  [ sec : spinpol ] , the lex - polarimeter is sensitive to spin direction along the scattering target s magnetization direction , or the @xmath34 direction as drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : main ] .",
    "photoelectron spin direction is not rotated through the 90@xmath0 bend of the bpf , so the polarimeter is thus sensitive to the out - of - plane polarization component of the photoemitting sample , @xmath77 . by rotating the scattering target within the polarimeter by 90@xmath0 about @xmath78 , the polarimeter becomes sensitive to the polarization component along the sample s vertical in - plane axis , @xmath79 .",
    "rotating the entire spectrometer 90@xmath0 about the optical axis of ls1/ls2 aligns the polarimeter to access components along the sample s horizontal in - plane axis , @xmath80 ( as well as still the @xmath77 axis ) .",
    "thus the 90@xmath0 bpf allows measurements of spin polarization along all three sample axes if desired .",
    "the 90@xmath0 bpf adds a number of complications , as well .",
    "the dispersive and focal properties of the spherical electrodes result in finite timing aberration contributions ( @xmath59 ) as electrons take flight paths of differing lengths through the orbit depending on energy , entrance angle , and entrance position.@xcite these timing aberrations decrease with increasing @xmath76 ( as @xmath81 for 180@xmath0 sectors@xcite ) . as increasing @xmath76",
    "gives larger passed energy windows , it is in general advantageous to use the bpf with as high @xmath76 as possible ( @xmath2 50 ev in practice ) . for typical",
    "synchrotron photon energies , this means retarding photoelectrons through ls1 , accelerating them for a high @xmath76 through the bpf , and then retarding them again in ls3 for a low average flight energy . by focusing the electron beam at the midpoint of the bpf ( 45@xmath0 ) , instead of at the entrance as is typical of 180@xmath0 heas , the path length dependence on bpf entrance angle is removed , thus significantly reducing timing aberrations even for a large initial acceptance angle into the spectrometer .",
    "this effect on timing aberrations can be seen by tuning the bpf focal point with careful adjustment of the voltage @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : main ] ) to a minimum in observed energy / timing resolution during an experiment .",
    "remaining timing aberrations due to positional dependence , or focal spot size , in the bpf can be kept insignificantly low with a small source spot ; the 100 micron photon spot sizes available at current synchrotron light sources is sufficiently small .",
    "our calculations show that with such a spot size and proper tuning , bpf timing aberrations for a wide range of lens system parameters is kept below 15 ps ( much less than @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) , and is thus only a small contribution to total energy resolution .",

    "the spectrometer voltages were left the same as for fig  [ fig : ausr ] ( b ) , but the photon energy was increased by 20 ev to measure this flat background signal under identical spectrometer conditions .",
    "figure  [ fig : nopol](a ) shows the resulting spectra with the polarimeter scattering target magnetized in both directions ; the normalized asymmetry is shown in panel ( b ) and is defined as the spectrometer s @xmath111 as no asymmetry due to spin polarization is expected .",
    "very little asymmetry is measured and deviations from zero seem only due to noise .",
    "the total asymmetry integrated across the spectrum shown is 0.034% @xmath1120.035% .",
    "this is far lower than mott polarimeters ( typical @xmath210% , as low as 2.6%@xcite ) and other lex polarimeter systems ( 3%@xcite , 10 - 15%@xcite ) , and is an order of magnitude lower than the lowest value reported in the literature to our knowledge ( 0.3%@xcite ) .",
    "thus error in polarization measurements due to instrumental asymmetry ( equation  [ eq : instr ] ) is effectively removed , and double measurements with reversal of source polarization is not necessary .",
    "lex - polarimeters can be less sensitive to instrumental asymmetries than mott polarimeters in general as they use a single detector for both intensity measurements .",
    "the present design likely results in a particularly low instrumental asymmetry due to the high quality magnetic shielding , the low stray field from the scattering target , and the low stray field from the magnetizing coil design .",
    "further , the instrumental asymmetries of lex - polarimeters are in general less sensitive to beam alignment than mott polarimeters as the @xmath12 does not depend significantly on the incident angle or target beam spot position within a few degrees or mm , respectively.@xcite in the present measurements , the photon beam spot is simply aligned with respect to the spin - tof analyzer by maximizing the total count rate , which is insensitive to position through more than 100% of the beam size . as no further precise alignment is used , through significant experience it is clear that the presented instrumental asymmetry is not at all dependent on beam alignment through this range of positions and likely much more .",
    "we have presented a new spectrometer for spin - resolved arpes , integrating a newly designed lex - polarimeter into a flexible tof energy analyzer .",
    "lex - polarimeters offer increases in detection efficiency of up to 100 times that of mott polarimeters , while tof based spin - resolved systems offer at least an order of magnitude efficiency increase over the wider - spread hemispherical analyzers .",
    "this particular combination has not , to our knowledge , been previously developed .",
    "the spectrometer includes two modes of operation with distinct flight paths for both rapid , full spectrum , spin - integrated measurements , and more narrow , high - resolution spin - resolved measurements .",
    "the inclusion of a 90@xmath0 dispersive element in the latter path allows for lower flight energies and higher energy resolutions than would otherwise be possible with most synchrotron light sources .",
    "energy resolutions at @xmath113 as low as 10 mev with photon energies of 28 ev have been demonstrated .",
    "the polarimeter allows flexible orientation of the spin - analysis axis anywhere within the transverse plane and allows straightforward use of a wide variety of scattering target systems .",
    "an instrumental asymmetry of @xmath114% is directly measured . full operation of the spectrometer is demonstrated through the acquisition of spin - arpes of the rashba spin - split au(111 ) surface state .",
    "complete realization of the potential of this instrument can provide much improved efficiency and resolution for the spin - arpes experiments in current demand .    _ note added .",
    "_ during the submission process of this manuscript , work to further improve the energy resolution achieved with the spin polarimeter proceeded as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin ] .",
    "a more complete graphite coating of the electron - optical surfaces within the polarimeter was performed , and extra apertures were installed for removing possible electrons that scatter from the optics upstream of the polarimeter and those that scatter inelastically from the target far from the specular geometry . a total experimental energy resolution of 20 mev was recently demonstrated with the spin - polarimeter in m2 mode of the spin - tof spectrometer at beamline 12.0.1 of the als during 2-bunch mode with very similar count rates as in the present paper . removing contributions from beamline resolution and temperature broadening in this experiment ( @xmath2 15 mev and 6 mev , respectively ) leaves a total of @xmath3@xmath212 mev for the spectrometer .",
    "these results will be further discussed in a later publication .",
