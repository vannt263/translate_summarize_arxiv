    "the famous essay maxwell(1859)@xcite discussed the stability of the rings of saturn by mathematical modeling . under the hypothesis that the motion of the rings is uniform and should be stable , he abandoned the possibilities that the rings are connected solid , or continuous liquid .",
    "he concluded that the rings should be composed of countless discrete particles ( @xcite , p.66 ) after an important intermediate study . in that study , he conceived a very nearly circular and uniform ring of satellites with equal masses , and found that the ring is linearly stable provided the ratio of saturn s mass to the total mass of @xmath0 satellites is greater than @xmath5 ( @xcite , p.25 or p.59 ) .",
    "this essay has aroused attentions of many aspects .",
    "one can also refer to a french monument written by tisserand@xcite .",
    "pendse ( 1935)@xcite pointed out that maxwell s ring model could not be applied to the cases when @xmath0 is smaller than seven , because maxwell assumed tacitly the center of primary to be the center of masses .",
    "scheeres & vinh ( 1991)@xcite accepted pendse s argument , and analyzed the characteristic equations very attentively .",
    "they pointed out a miscalculation of pendse , and concluded that the upper bound of the ratio of the total mass of @xmath0 satellites to the dominant mass for stability can be represented by an asymptotic series of @xmath0 if @xmath6 , and is about @xmath7 when @xmath0 is large .",
    "similar results are also achieved by roberts ( 2000)@xcite and vanderbei & kolemen ( 2007)@xcite .",
    "consider the planar @xmath8-body problem with @xmath9 in a uniformly rotating coordinate system with the origin at the center of masses .",
    "suppose one mass is large and the other @xmath0 masses are very small . as the order of magnitude of the @xmath0 small masses tends to zero , the limiting case of a relative equilibrium of this problem ,",
    "is called a _ relative equilibrium _ of the @xmath1-body problem , which was defined by g. r. hall in an unpublished paper @xcite . the relationship between the relative equilibria of @xmath1-body problem and",
    "those of the @xmath8-body problem with @xmath9 has been revealed by moeckel ( 1994)@xcite , and will be mentioned in section 2 .    if all the infinitesimal masses are equal , casasayas et al .",
    "( 1994)@xcite showed that when @xmath10 , the only stationary configuration is maxwell s ring configuration . when @xmath11 , other configurations exist , referring to salo & yoder ( 1988)@xcite . according to salo & yoder s numerical quest",
    ", it seems that there is only one type of stationary configuration when @xmath12 , and this conjecture is also supported by the numerical experiment of carles sim ( @xcite , p.326 ) .",
    "when @xmath13 , the numerical results on the numbers of stationary configurations also concide with analytical proofs , see cors et al .",
    "( 2004)@xcite , albouy & fu ( 2009)@xcite . for the cases of @xmath14 , they seem to be much more difficult to deal with , as the case of @xmath15 had already been claimed by hall to be difficult to handle ( @xcite , p.12 ) .",
    "if the infinitesimal masses are arbitrarily given , maxwell said that we must calculate the disturbing forces due to any given displacement of the ring(@xcite , p.38 ) , so it is difficult to determine the stability of a non - regular configuration .",
    "salo & yoder ( 1988 ) studied a special case of @xmath16 with a background of saturn s coorbital satellites , and renner & sicardy ( 2004)@xcite studied the cases of @xmath17 .",
    "recently , corbera et al.(2011)@xcite researched into the case of @xmath16 and obtained two classes of new configurations generated by changing the infinitesimal masses .",
    "they also calculated the number of configurations with a high precision , and found that the number varies from five to seven .",
    "the new results gotten in this paper are especially about the existence and linear stability of the regular @xmath0-gon relative equilibria in the @xmath1-body problem with two kinds of infinitesimal masses . in section 2.1",
    ", we introduce hall s potential function on the regular @xmath0-gon relative equilibria of the @xmath1-body problem .",
    "then the method for calculating eigenvalues of the hessian matrix of hall s potential function is described in section 2.2 and 2.3 . in section 3",
    ", we show the existence of a set of positive infinitesimal masses for the regular @xmath0-gon relative equilibria . in section 4 ,",
    "we show the linear stabilities of regular @xmath0-gon relative equilibria with @xmath0 even .",
    "the last section is the conclusion part , and we also give some vistas for future study .",
    "there are two ways for the definition of a relative equilibrium of the @xmath1-body problem .",
    "one way is to make a first approximation of the full system , then write out the conditional equations for a relative equilibrium , for example , salo , yoder ( 1988 ) .",
    "the other way is to make a limiting case of the conditional equations for a relative equilibrium of the full system , for example , moeckel ( 1994 ) .",
    "we obtain the conditional equations for relative equilibria of the @xmath1-body problem by the second way .",
