    "we find _ strong randomness of the off - diagonal gluon phase _ @xmath4 in the ma gauge using the su(2 ) lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "in fact , we find very small correlation between neighboring phases , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , on the lattice in the ma and u(1)@xmath7 landau gauge .",
    "this tendency seems natural because of the following reasons .",
    "off - diagonal gluon phase @xmath4 is not constrained by the ma gauge - fixing condition at all , and the constraint from the qcd action is also small because of strong suppression of the off - diagonal gluon amplitude @xmath8 in the ma gauge . within the random phase - variable approximation , _ perfect abelian dominance for the string tension _",
    "can be clearly demonstrated @xcite .",
    "using the su(2 ) lattice qcd with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , we study the off - diagonal gluon propagator @xmath12 as the function of @xmath13 in the ma gauge with u(1)@xmath7 landau gauge fixing @xcite . from the slope of the logarithmic plot of @xmath14 in fig.1(a ) , we get the off - diagonal gluon mass as @xmath15 1.2 gev in the ma gauge @xcite as shown in fig.1(b ) . thus , in the ma gauge , the off - diagonal gluon can not carry the long - range interaction such as the confinement force . this is the essence of infrared abelian dominance .",
    "in fact , qcd in the ma gauge behaves as a strong - coupling compact qed at the larger scale than @xmath16 0.2 fm @xcite .",
    "using the su(2 ) lattice qcd with @xmath11 and @xmath17 , we extract the dual gluon field @xmath2 from the monopole current @xmath18 appearing in the ma gauge , and investigate the dual gluon properties @xcite .",
    "+ ( 1 ) from the dual wilson loop , we obtain the inter - monopole potential in the monopole part .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the dual gluon propagator @xmath19 is measured in the dual landau gauge @xmath20 . + as the evidence of the dual higgs mechanism by color - magnetic monopole condensation , the dual gluon mass is estimated as @xmath21 0.5 gev from the lattice data in 0.4 fm @xmath22 1.5 fm @xcite .",
    "here , the dual gluon mass @xmath21 0.5 gev provides the key parameter of the dgl theory .",
    "we investigate the qcd - monopole structure in the ma gauge in the lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "+ ( 1 ) around the qcd - monopole , both the abelian action density @xmath23 and the off - diagonal gluon contribution @xmath24 are largely fluctuated , and their cancellation keeps the total qcd action density @xmath25 small @xcite .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the qcd - monopole has an intrinsic structure relating to a large amount of off - diagonal gluons around its center , similar to the t hooft - polyakov monopole @xcite . at a large scale where this structure becomes invisible ,",
    "qcd - monopoles can be regarded as point - like dirac monopoles .",
    "+ ( 3 ) from the concentration of off - diagonal gluons around qcd - monopoles in the ma gauge , we can naturally understand the _",
    "local correlation between monopoles and instantons .",
    "_ in fact , instantons tend to appear around the monopole world - line in the ma gauge , because instantons need full su(2 ) gluon components for existence @xcite .",
    "in the ma gauge , the off - diagonal gluon contribution can be neglected and monopole condensation occurs at the infrared scale of qcd .",
    "therefore , the qcd vacuum in the ma gauge can be regarded as the dual superconductor described by the dgl theory , and quark confinement can be understood with the dual meissner effect .",
    "the dgl theory can describe not only quark confinement @xcite but also dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking ( d@xmath26sb ) by solving the schwinger - dyson equation for the quark field @xcite .",
    "monopole dominance for d@xmath26sb is also found from the analysis of the effective potential @xcite . using the dgl theory ,",
    "we have studied the qcd phase transition ( deconfinement @xcite and chiral restoration @xcite ) at finite temperature , the qgp creation process in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite , hadronization in the early universe @xcite , and glueball properties @xcite systematically .",
