    "it is well known that probability theory provides a mathematically rigorous setting to investigate problems from equilibrium state statistical physics . here",
    "the object of consideration is a system of interacting particles , where the number of particles is huge and thus assumed to be infinite .",
    "such a particle system is given by specifying restrictions on particle positions ( lattice setting versus point particle setting ) , the internal properties of the particles ( such as magnetic spin , electric charge or particle type ) , and the interaction between particles .",
    "the equilibrium states of a specific particle system are then modeled by gibbsian processes , as introduced by r.  l.  dobrushin ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , o.  e.  lanford and d.  ruelle ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main objective usually is to find out whether the system exhibits a phase transition , i.e. whether there is more than one equilibrium state . in order to study this problem ,",
    "the crucial task is to investigate which of the system s symmetries are broken and which are conserved , and it would be desirable to have general results stating under which conditions certain symmetries are conserved . while in more than two spatial dimensions such general results can not be expected to hold ( as here all symmetries are believed to be broken easily ) , and in one dimension the situation is almost trivial ( as under very weak assumptions all symmetries are conserved ) , the case of two dimensions is interesting . here",
    "it is useful to distinguish between discrete and continuous symmetries and also between internal symmetries ( i.e. symmetry transformations concerning the inner properties of particles ) and spatial symmetries ( such as translation and rotation ) . in order to investigate the behavior of a particle system under translations and rotations",
    "it is natural to consider a point particle setting , as in a lattice setting all spatial symmetries are bound to be discrete . in the following the attention is thus restricted to interacting particle systems in a point particle setting in two dimensions .",
    "+ the current knowledge about such systems is the following : it is believed that discrete internal symmetries in general may be broken , but so far this has been shown only for very few systems , e.g. the widom rowlinson model considered by d.  ruelle @xcite or the continuum potts model considered by h .- o .",
    "georgii and o.  hggstrm @xcite .",
    "in contrast , continuous internal symmetries are conserved under weak assumptions on the interaction . the first result in this direction",
    "was obtained by s.  shlosman @xcite , building on earlier ideas of m.  mermin and h.  wagner @xcite .",
    "we gave a more general version of this result in @xcite , which includes the case of discontinuous interaction , using ideas of d.  ioffe , s.  shlosman and y.  velenik @xcite . while it is expected that rotational symmetry may be broken , so far this",
    "could not be established for any realistic particle system , but this conjecture is supported by recent work of f.  merkl and s.  rolles @xcite , for example .",
    "translational symmetry is conserved under weak assumptions on the interaction .",
    "this was first shown by e.  frhlich and c .- e .",
    "pfister @xcite and @xcite , and we obtained a more general result @xcite , which for example includes the interesting case of the hard disc model .",
    "the last two results both concern particles without internal degrees of freedom . however , many interesting models of statistical physics , such as the widom rowlinson or the potts model , feature particles with spins . here we will show , how to overcome conceptual and technical difficulties that arise due to the incorporation of spins , and thus we obtain a fairly general result on the conservation of translational symmetry for particles with any internal degrees of freedom and for interactions that are allowed to have discontinuities , singularities , or hard cores .",
    "this establishes the conservation of translational symmetry for the continuum widom rowlinson model and a large class of continuum potts type models , for example .",
    "while parts of the proof of the main theorem will be similar to the corresponding parts in @xcite , we decided to repeat these arguments for the convenience of the reader , so that the article is self - contained .",
    "+ we start section  [ secresult ] by giving an equivalent condition for a measure to be invariant under a transformation ( lemma  [ lekrit ] ) , which will be useful for establishing the conservation of symmetries .",
    "we next confine ourselves to the special case of translational symmetry , considering a class of potts type potentials .",
    "the corresponding result ( theorem  [ pottstype ] ) , which is of interest on its own , will follow from the general case presented afterwards .",
    "for this general case we define a class of potentials ( definition  [ defgapprox ] ) for that translational symmetry is conserved ( theorem  [ sym ] ) .",
    "after a few comments on some aspects of this class concerning hard cores ( lemmas  [ lebedeperw ] and [ leballs ] ) we give sufficient conditions for potentials to belong to this class ( lemmas  [ lepotglatt ] and [ lepotpotts ] ) .",

    "we consider particles in the plane @xmath0 . every particle is allowed to have internal degrees of freedom , encoded in the so called spin of the particle .",

    "a bimeasurable transformation @xmath14 is called a _ symmetry _ of @xmath9",

    "if this is indeed the case , the symmetry is said to be conserved , otherwise it is said to be broken .",
    "+ there are several strategies to establish the conservation of symmetries .",
    "one is to use the concept of relative entropy and to exploit certain entropy estimates , see section  2.3.3 . of @xcite .",
    "another one builds on a certain inequality for gibbsian specifications , see proposition ( 9.1 ) of @xcite .",
    "the latter approach uses the convexity of the set of gibbs measures , tail triviality of extremal gibbs measures and extreme decomposition , thus requiring the spin space to be standard borel . in the following",
    "we present a variant of this approach , which works in a general setting and admits a straightforward proof via convexity .",
