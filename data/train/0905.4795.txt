    "this article is intended as an introduction to the gauge theory approach @xcite to the geometric langlands correspondence .",
    "but rather than a conventional overview , such as i have attempted elsewhere @xcite , here i will focus on explaining what we need to understand a very particular result , which i learned of from the expository article @xcite .",
    "( another standard reference on closely related matters is @xcite . )",
    "the present introduction will be devoted to describing the facts that we wish to explain . in section [ gaugetheory ] , gauge theory  in the form of new results about how duality acts on boundary conditions @xcite ",
    "will be brought to bear to explain them .",
    "finally , some technical details are reserved for section [ details ] . in section [ reduction ]",
    ", we also briefly discuss compactification of the relevant gauge theory to three dimensions , showing some novel features that appear to be relevant to recent work @xcite . and in section [ genker ] , we discuss the universal kernel of geometric langlands from a gauge theory point of view .",
    "let us start with a compact simple lie group @xmath1 and its langlands or goddard - nuyts - olive dual group @xmath0 .",
    "( in gauge theory , we start with a compact gauge group @xmath1 , but by the time we make contact with the usual statements of geometric langlands , @xmath1 is replaced by its complexification @xmath3 . )",
    "if we write @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the respective maximal tori , then the basic relation between them is that @xmath6 and vice - versa .",
    "modulo some standard facts about simple lie groups , this relation defines the correspondence between @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "now let @xmath7 be an irreducible representation of @xmath0 .",
    "its highest weight is a homomorphism @xmath8 . via ( [ poly ] ) , this corresponds to a homomorphism in the opposite direction @xmath9 .",
    "l we can think of @xmath10 as the equator in @xmath11 .",
    "with this understood , we can view @xmath12 as a `` clutching function '' that defines a holomorphic @xmath3 bundle @xmath13 .",
    "every holomorphic @xmath3 bundle over @xmath14 arises this way , up to isomorphism , for a unique choice of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , isomorphism classes of such bundles correspond to isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of @xmath0 . in the language of goddard , nuyts , and olive ,",
    "this is the correspondence between electric charge of @xmath0 and magnetic charge of @xmath1 .",
    "actually , the homomorphism @xmath15 can be complexified to a homomorphism @xmath16 . here",
    ", we can view @xmath17 as the complement in @xmath14 of two points @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( the north and south poles ) .",
    "so the bundle @xmath20 is naturally made by gluing a trivial bundle over @xmath21 to a trivial bundle over @xmath22 . in particular , @xmath20 is naturally trivial over the complement of the point @xmath23 .",
    "so @xmath20 is `` a hecke modification at @xmath18 of the trivial @xmath3 bundle over @xmath14 . '' by definition , such a hecke modification is simply a holomorphic @xmath3 bundle @xmath24 with a trivialization over the complement of @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath25 is said to be of type @xmath26 if , forgetting the trivialization , it is equivalent holomorphically to @xmath20 .",
    "more generally , for any riemann surface @xmath27 , point @xmath28 , and holomorphic @xmath3 bundle @xmath29 , a hecke modification of @xmath30 at @xmath18 is a holomorphic @xmath3 bundle @xmath31 with an isomorphism @xmath32 away from @xmath18 . as in @xcite ,",
    "loop groups and affine grassmannians give a natural language for describing these notions , and explaining in general what it means to say that a hecke modification is of type @xmath26 .",
    "we will not need this language here .",
    "let us consider an example .",
    "suppose that @xmath33 for some @xmath34 , and accordingly its complexification is @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    ". we can think of a holomorphic @xmath3 bundle as a rank @xmath34 holomorphic vector bundle @xmath38 , with an equivalence relation @xmath39 , for any holomorphic line bundle @xmath40 .",
    "( the equivalence relation will not play an important role in what we are about to say . )",
    "let us take the representation @xmath7 to be the obvious @xmath34-dimensional representation of @xmath41 . to this data",
    ", we should associate a rank @xmath34 holomorphic bundle @xmath42 that is obtained by modifying the trivial bundle @xmath43 at a single point @xmath23 .",
    "more precisely , we will get a family of possible @xmath38 s  the possible hecke modifications of @xmath44 of the appropriate type . to describe such a @xmath38 ,",
    "pick a one - dimensional complex subspace @xmath45 and let @xmath46 be a local coordinate near @xmath18 . and declare that a holomorphic section @xmath47 of @xmath38 over an open set @xmath48 is a holomorphic section of @xmath44 over @xmath49 which near @xmath18 looks like @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are holomorphic at @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this gives a hecke modification of @xmath44 , since @xmath38 is naturally equivalent to @xmath44 away from @xmath53 .",
    "clearly , the definition of @xmath38 depends on @xmath55 , so we have really constructed a family of possible @xmath38 s , parametrized by @xmath56 .",
    "this is the family of all possible hecke modifications of the appropriate type .",
    "there is an analog of this for any choice of representation @xmath7 of the dual group .",
    "to such a representation , we associate as before the clutching function @xmath57 , leading to a holomorphic @xmath3 bundle @xmath58 . then we define @xmath59 to be the space of all possible ( which is conjugate to the original homomorphism @xmath60 ) .",
    "accordingly , in our example , @xmath59 is a homogeneous space for an obvious action of @xmath3 . in general , this is only so if the representation @xmath7 is `` minuscule , '' as it is in our example . ]",
    "hecke modifications at @xmath18 of the trivial bundle over @xmath61 that are of type @xmath26 .",
    "modifications has a natural compactification @xmath62 . in the description of @xmath62 via the three - dimensional bogomolny equations , which we come to in section [ gaugetheory ] , the compactification involves monopole bubbling , which is analogous to instanton bubbling in four dimensions .",
    "@xmath59 is known as a schubert cell in the affine grassmannian , and @xmath62 as a schubert cycle in that grassmannian .",
    "@xmath62 parametrizes a family of hecke modifications of the trivial bundle , but they are not all of type @xmath26 ; the compactification is achieved by allowing hecke modifications dual to a representation of @xmath0 whose highest weight is `` smaller '' than that of @xmath7 .",
    "geometric langlands duality associates the representation @xmath7 of the dual group to the cohomology of @xmath62 .",
    "let us see how this works in our example .    in the example",
    ", @xmath7 is the natural @xmath34-dimensional representation of @xmath64 , and @xmath59 ( which needs no compactification , as @xmath7 is minuscule ) is @xmath65 not coincidentally , the cohomology of @xmath65 is of rank @xmath34 , the dimension of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the generators of the cohomology of @xmath65 are in degrees @xmath66 .",
    "let us shift the degrees by @xmath67 so that they are symmetrically spaced around zero",
    ". then we can write a diagonal matrix whose eigenvalues are the appropriate degrees : @xmath68 one may recognize this matrix ; it is an element of the lie algebra of @xmath41 that , in the language of kostant , generates the maximal torus of a `` principal @xmath2 subgroup '' of @xmath69 .",
    "this is the general state of affairs . in the correspondence between a representation @xmath7 and the cohomology of the corresponding moduli space @xmath62 , the grading of the cohomology by degree corresponds to the action on @xmath7 of a generator of the maximal torus of a principal @xmath2 .",
    "the nilpotent `` raising operator '' of the principal @xmath2 also plays a role . to understand this , first recall that atiyah and bott @xcite used gauge theory to define certain universal cohomology classes over any family of @xmath3-bundles over a riemann surface @xmath27 .",
    "the definition applies immediately to @xmath62 , which parametrizes a family of holomorphic @xmath3-bundles over @xmath61 ( hecke modifications of a trivial bundle ) .",
    "if @xmath1 is of rank @xmath70 , then the ring of invariant polynomials on the lie algebra @xmath71 of @xmath1 is itself a polynomial ring with @xmath70 generators , say @xmath72 , which we can take to be homogeneous of degrees @xmath73 .",
    "the relation of the @xmath74 to a principal @xmath2 subgroup of @xmath3 is as follows : the lie algebra @xmath71 decomposes under the principal @xmath2 as a direct sum @xmath75 of irreducible modules @xmath76 of dimensions @xmath77 .",
    "( in particular , therefore , @xmath78 . )",
    "for example , if @xmath79 , then @xmath80 ; letting @xmath81 denote an invariant quadratic form on @xmath71 , we can take the @xmath82 to be the polynomials @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "thus , @xmath82 is homogeneous of degree @xmath86 . as in this example ,",
    "if @xmath1 is simple , the smallest value of the degrees @xmath74 is always 2 and this value occurs precisely once .",
    "the corresponding polynomial @xmath87 is simply an invariant quadratic form on the lie algebra @xmath71 .    if @xmath88 is the curvature of a @xmath1-bundle over any space @xmath89 , then @xmath90 is a @xmath91-dimensional characteristic class , taking values in @xmath92 .",
    "( for topological purposes , it does not matter if we consider @xmath1-bundles or @xmath3-bundles . )",
    "atiyah and bott consider the case that @xmath89 parametrizes a family of @xmath1-bundles over a riemann surface @xmath27 .",
    "we let @xmath93 be the corresponding universal @xmath1-bundle .",
    "( if necessary , we consider the associated @xmath94 bundle and define the @xmath90 as rational characteristic classes . ) from the class @xmath95 , we can construct two families of cohomology classes over @xmath89 .",
    "fixing a point @xmath96 , and writing @xmath97 for the projection @xmath98 , we set @xmath99 to be the restriction of @xmath90 to @xmath100 .",
    "we also set @xmath101 .",
    "thus , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .",
    "to summarize , @xmath104    for our present purposes , we want @xmath89 to be one of the families @xmath105 of hecke modifications of the trivial bundle @xmath106 at a specified point @xmath23 .",
    "taking @xmath107 to be disjoint from @xmath18 , it is clear that the classes @xmath99 vanish for @xmath108 ( since a hecke modification at @xmath18 has no effect at @xmath107 ) .",
    "however , the classes @xmath109 are non - zero and interesting .    multiplication by @xmath109 gives an endomorphism of @xmath110 that increases the degree by @xmath111 .",
    "it must map under duality to an endomorphism @xmath112 of @xmath7 that increases the eigenvalue of @xmath113 ( the generator of a cartan subalgebra of a principal @xmath2 ) by @xmath111 .",
    "thus , we expect @xmath114=(2d_i-2)f_i$ ] .",
    "moreover , the @xmath112 must commute , since the @xmath109 do .    as noted above",
    ", the smallest value of the degrees @xmath74 is 2 , which occurs precisely once .",
    "so this construction gives an essentially unique class , @xmath115 can also be constructed as the first chern class of the `` determinant line bundle '' associated to the family @xmath89 of vector bundles over @xmath27 . for @xmath116 or @xmath117 , @xmath115",
    "can similarly be constructed as the first chern class of a pfaffian line bundle .",
    "] @xmath115 of degree 2 .",
    "it turns out that duality maps @xmath115 to the nilpotent raising operator of the principal @xmath2 subgroup of @xmath1 that we have already encountered ( the action of whose maximal torus is dual to the grading of @xmath110 by degree ) .",
    "this being so , since the @xmath109 all commute with @xmath115 , duality must map them to elements of @xmath71 that commute with the raising operator of the principal @xmath2 .",
    "these are precisely the highest weight vectors in the @xmath2 modules @xmath76 of eqn .",
    "( [ dirsum ] ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath64 , the raising operator of the principal @xmath2 is the matrix @xmath118 with @xmath119 s just above the main diagonal .",
    "the image of the two - dimensional class @xmath115 under duality is precisely @xmath120 .",
    "indeed , in this example , the cohomology of @xmath121 is spanned by the classes @xmath122 , and in this basis ( which we have used in writing the degree operator as in eqn .",
    "( [ zolme ] ) ) , @xmath115 coincides with the matrix @xmath120 .",
    "the traceless matrices that commute with @xmath120 ( in other words , the highest weight vectors of the @xmath76 ) are the matrices @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "the invariant polynomial @xmath125 , with @xmath126 , is associated with a class @xmath109 of dimension @xmath127 .",
    "this class maps under duality to @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath129 be the subgroup of @xmath69 generated by a maximal torus in a principal @xmath2 subgroup together with the highest weight vectors in the decomposition ( [ dirsum ] ) .",
    "a summary of part of what we have said is that the action of @xmath129 on the representation @xmath7 corresponds to a natural @xmath129 action on the cohomology of @xmath62 .",
    "the rest of the @xmath0 action on @xmath7 does not have any equally direct meaning in terms of the cohomology of @xmath62 .",
    "there are additional facts of a similar nature .",
    "our goal here is not to describe all such facts but to explain how such facts can emerge from gauge theory .",
    "one obvious gap in what we have said so far is that we have treated independently each representation @xmath7 of the dual group @xmath0 .",
    "for example , in section [ chg ] , the characteristic class @xmath115 was defined uniformly for all @xmath62 by a universal gauge theory construction .",
    "but it might appear from the analysis that @xmath115 could map under duality to a multiple of the lie algebra element @xmath120 of equation ( [ thel ] ) ( or more exactly , a multiple of the linear transformation by which @xmath120 acts in the representation @xmath7 ) , with a different multiple for every representation .",
    "actually , the different irreducible representations of @xmath0 are linked by the classical operation of taking a tensor product of two representations and decomposing it in a direct sum of irreducibles .",
    "this operation is dual to a certain natural `` convolution '' operation @xcite on the cohomology of the moduli spaces @xmath62 .",
    "this operation also has a gauge theory interpretation , as we recall shortly .",
    "suppose that @xmath130 and @xmath131 are two irreducible representations of @xmath0 , and that the decomposition of their tensor product is @xmath132 where @xmath133 are inequivalent irreducible representations of @xmath0 , and @xmath134 are vector spaces ( with trivial action of @xmath0 ) . for each @xmath135 ,",
    "let @xmath136 be the homomorphism corresponding to @xmath137 . under the duality maps @xmath138 , eqn .",
    "( [ golly ] ) must correspond to a decomposition @xmath139 with the same vector spaces @xmath140 as before .",
    "indeed @xcite , the appropriate decomposition can be described directly in terms of the affine grassmannian of @xmath1 without reference to duality .",
    "this decomposition is compatible with the action of group @xmath129 described in section [ chg ] .",
    "in other words , @xmath129 acts on each factor on the left of ( [ olly ] ) , and hence on the tensor product ; it likewise acts on each summand on the right of ( [ olly ] ) and hence on the direct sum ; and these actions agree .    in gauge theory terms , the classical tensor product of representations ( [ golly ] ) corresponds to the operator product expansion for wilson operators , and the corresponding decomposition ( [ olly ] ) corresponds to the operator product expansion for t hooft operators .",
    "this has been explained in @xcite , section 10.4 , and that story will not be repeated here . however , in section [ fusion ] , we will explain why the operator product expansions ( or in other words the above decompositions ) are compatible with the action of @xmath129 .",
    "let @xmath143 be a four - manifold .",
    "we will be studying gauge theory on @xmath143  more specifically , the twisted version of @xmath144 super yang - mills theory that is related to geometric langlands duality .",
    "we write @xmath145 for the gauge field , which is a connection on a bundle @xmath146 , and @xmath88 for its curvature .",
    "another important ingredient in the theory is a one - form @xmath147 that is valued in @xmath148 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the twisting introduces an asymmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath145 and @xmath147 combine together in quite different ways in the two cases .    in the @xmath0 theory , which we will loosely call the @xmath149-model ( because on compactification to two dimensions , it reduces to an ordinary @xmath150-model ) , @xmath145 and @xmath147 combine together to a complexified connection @xmath151 . as explained in @xcite , supersymmetry in the @xmath149-model requires the connection @xmath152 to be flat .",
    "so the @xmath149-model involves the study of representations of the fundamental group of @xmath143 in @xmath69 .",
    "as long as the flat connection @xmath152 is irreducible , it is the only important variable in the @xmath149-model .",
    "however , we will later analyze a situation in which the condition of irreducibility is not satisfied , so we will encounter other variables ( also described in @xcite ) .    in the @xmath1 theory ,",
    "the pair @xmath153 instead obey a nonlinear elliptic equation @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the hodge star operator and @xmath156 is the gauge - covariant extension of the exterior derivative .",
    "this equation is analogous to the instanton equations of two - dimensional @xmath145-models ( as well as to other familiar equations such as hitchin s equations in two dimensions ) , so we will call the model the @xmath157-model . the equation ( [ yerf ] ) may be unfamiliar , but it has various specializations that are more familiar .",
    "for example , suppose that @xmath158 , and that the solution is invariant under rigid motions of @xmath159 including those that reverse orientation .",
    "( to get a symmetry of ( [ yerf ] ) , orientation reversal must be accompanied by a sign change of @xmath147 . ) parametrizing @xmath159 by a real coordinate @xmath160 , the conditions imply that @xmath145 is pulled back from @xmath161 , and that @xmath162 where the section @xmath163 of @xmath148 is also pulled back from @xmath161 .",
    "then ( [ yerf ] ) specializes to the three - dimensional bogomolny equations : @xmath164 here @xmath155 is now the hodge star operator in three dimensions . similarly ( [ yerf ] ) can be reduced to hitchin s equations in two dimensions .",
    "( for this , we take @xmath165 , where @xmath166 and @xmath27 are two riemann surfaces , and assume that @xmath145 and @xmath147 are pulled back from @xmath27 . )",
    "the bogomolny equations have been extensively studied , for instance in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath167 be an embedded oriented one - manifold .",
    "we want to make some modification along @xmath168 of gauge theory on @xmath143 .    starting with the @xmath149-model ,",
    "one `` classical '' modification is to suppose that @xmath168 is the trajectory of a  charged particle \" in the representation @xmath7 of the gauge group , which we take to be @xmath0 .",
    "mathematically , we achieve this by including in the `` path integral '' of the theory a factor consisting of the trace , in the @xmath7 representation , of the holonomy around @xmath168 of the complexified connection @xmath152 .",
    "this trace might be denoted as @xmath169 ; physicists usually write it as @xmath170 .",
    "since it is just a function of @xmath152 , this operator preserves the topological invariance of the @xmath149-model .",
    "( the @xmath149-model condition that @xmath152 is flat means that the holonomy only depends on the homotopy class of @xmath168 . ) when included as a factor in a quantum path integral , the holonomy is known as a wilson operator .    in taking the trace of the holonomy",
    ", we have assumed that @xmath168 is a closed one - manifold , that is , a circle . if @xmath143 is compact , this is the only relevant case .",
    "more generally , if @xmath143 has boundaries or ends , one also considers the case that @xmath168 is an open one - manifold that connects boundaries or ends of @xmath143 .",
    "then instead of a trace , one considers the matrix elements of the holonomy between prescribed initial and final states  that is , prescribed initial and final vectors in @xmath7 .",
    "this is actually the situation that we will consider momentarily .",
    "what is the dual in @xmath1 gauge theory of including the holonomy factor in @xmath0 gauge theory ? the dual is the t hooft operator .",
    "it was essentially shown by t hooft nearly thirty years ago that the dual operation to including a holonomy factor or wilson operator is to modify the theory by requiring the fields to have a certain type of singularity along @xmath168 .",
    "this singularity gives a way to study via gauge theory the hecke modifications of a @xmath1-bundle on a riemann surface .",
    "the required singularity and its interpretation in terms of hecke modifications have been described in sections 9 and 10 of @xcite ; a few relevant points are summarized in section [ bogsing ] .      in this article ,",
    "our interest is in the representation @xmath7 , not the four - manifold @xmath143 .",
    "so we simply want to pick @xmath143 and the embedded one - manifold @xmath168 to be as simple as possible .",
    "it is convenient to take @xmath158 , where @xmath161 is a three - manifold and @xmath159 parametrizes the `` time . ''",
    "we similarly take @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is a point in @xmath161 .",
    "henceforth we adopt a `` hamiltonian '' point of view in which , in effect , we work at time zero and only talk about @xmath161 .",
    "so instead of a four - manifold @xmath143 with an embedded one - manifold @xmath168 labeled by a representation @xmath7 , we consider a three - manifold @xmath161 with an embedded point @xmath173 labeled by that representation .",
    "the presence of this special point means that , in the quantization , we must include an `` external charge '' in the representation @xmath7 ,    moreover , we want to make a simple choice of @xmath161 so as to study the representation @xmath7 , and its dual , keeping away from the wonders of three - manifolds .    what is the simplest three - manifold ?",
    "@xmath174 comes to mind right away , but there is a snag .",
    "suppose that we study the @xmath0 gauge theory on @xmath175 , with a marked point @xmath173 that is labeled by the representation @xmath7 .",
    "what will the quantum hilbert space turn out to be ?",
    "a flat connection on @xmath174 is necessarily trivial , so there is no moduli space of flat connections to quantize . if the trivial flat connection on @xmath174 had no automorphisms , the quantum hilbert space of the @xmath149-model would be simply @xmath7 , as there is nothing else to quantize .",
    "however , the trivial flat connection on @xmath174 actually has a group @xmath3 of automorphisms , and in quantization , one is supposed to impose invariance under the group of gauge transformations . because of this , the quantum hilbert space is not @xmath7 but the @xmath69 invariant subspace of @xmath7  namely 0 .",
    "thus , simply taking @xmath175 , with a marked point labeled by the representation @xmath7 , will not give us a way to use the @xmath149-model to study the representation @xmath7 .",
    "what we seem to need  a three - manifold on which the trivial flat connection is unique and irreducible  does not exist .",
    "however , we can pick @xmath161 to be a three - manifold with boundary , provided that we endow the boundary with a supersymmetric boundary condition . for example , suppose that @xmath161 is a three - dimensional ball @xmath176 .",
    "we may pick dirichlet boundary conditions on the boundary of @xmath176 . in the @xmath149-model ,",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions mean that @xmath152 is trivial on the boundary @xmath177 , and that only gauge transformations that are trivial on the boundary are allowed .",
    "if we formulate the @xmath149-model on @xmath176 with dirichlet boundary conditions and a marked point labeled by @xmath7 , then as there are no nontrivial flat connections and the trivial one has no gauge symmetries , the physical hilbert space is a copy of @xmath7 .",
    "so this does give a way to study the representation @xmath7 as a space of physical states in the @xmath149-model .",
    "the only trouble is that the dual of dirichlet boundary conditions is rather complicated @xcite , and the resulting @xmath157-model picture is not very transparent .",
    "there is another choice that turns out to be more useful because it gives something that is tractable in both the @xmath157-model and the @xmath149-model .",
    "this is to take @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is a closed interval .",
    "of course , @xmath161 has two ends , since @xmath180 has two boundary points .",
    "suppose that we pick dirichlet boundary conditions at one end of @xmath181 and neumann boundary conditions at the other .",
    "( neumann boundary conditions in gauge theory mean that the gauge field and the gauge transformations are arbitrary on the boundary ; instead there is a condition on the normal derivative of the gauge field , though we will not have to consider it explicitly because it is a consequence of the equations that we will be solving anyway . ) with these boundary conditions , the trivial flat connection on @xmath161 is unique and irreducible .",
    "by contrast , if we were to place dirichlet boundary conditions at both ends of @xmath181 , there would be non - trivial flat connections classified by the holonomy along a path from one end to the other ; with dirichlet boundary conditions at both ends , this holonomy is gauge - invariant . and if we were to place neumann boundary conditions at both ends , every flat connection would be gauge - equivalent to the trivial one , but ( since there would be no restriction on the boundary values of a gauge transformation ) the trivial flat connection would have a group @xmath3 of automorphisms , coming from constant gauge transformations .",
    "the case that works well is therefore the case of mixed boundary conditions  dirichlet at one end and neumann at the other .",
    "so we could study the representation @xmath7 in the @xmath149-model by working on @xmath178 with mixed boundary conditions this may even be an interesting thing to do .     in @xmath1 gauge theory with a marked point @xmath173 at which an t hooft operator is inserted .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed at the right boundary and neumann boundary conditions at the left .",
    ", width=288 ]    instead here , we will do something that turns out to be simpler .",
    "we will study the @xmath157-model , not the @xmath149-model , on @xmath178 , with mixed dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions , and one marked point labeled by an t hooft singularity ( see fig .",

    "why therefore in the @xmath149-model is there a @xmath265 grading of the physical hilbert space @xmath202 ?",

    "the rotation of the @xmath266 plane does not act on the representation @xmath7 , but the gauge transformation does .",
    "so on the @xmath149-model side , the grading of @xmath202 comes from the action of @xmath270 .",
    "but since the boundary condition involves a regular nahm pole , @xmath270 generates the maximal torus of a principal @xmath2 subgroup of @xmath0 .",

    "these correspond to the zeroes of the nondegenerate quadratic form @xmath551 on @xmath570 .",

    "the quotient @xmath578 is just a copy of @xmath576 .",
    "however , @xmath552 does not act freely on @xmath579 .",
    "each point in @xmath579 is left fixed by a borel subgroup @xmath580 of @xmath552 , isomorphic to @xmath581 in the topological field theory associated to a particular choice of @xmath289 , this borel group acts as a group of symmetries . in particular",
    ", the cohomology of @xmath289 is @xmath474-graded by the action of the diagonal matrices in @xmath580 .",
    "so we have a family of @xmath474-graded three - dimensional topological field theories , parametrized by a copy of @xmath14 ( at this point we drop the tilde ) , with the property that @xmath445 .",
    "actually , these are simply the examples that come by compactification on @xmath507 of a four - dimensional topological field theory .    to get something new , we consider the examples for which @xmath446 is a nonzero multiple of @xmath548 .",
    "notice that @xmath570 is a complex manifold of complex dimension 3 , as is @xmath552 .",
    "this makes it possible for the complement of the quadric @xmath582 to consist of a single @xmath552 orbit .",
    "this is in fact the situation .",
    "bearing in mind the decomposition @xmath583 , where @xmath552 acts on the first factor and @xmath555 on the second , we can think of an element of @xmath545 as a @xmath584 matrix @xmath585 , @xmath586 , with @xmath552 and @xmath555 acting on @xmath587 respectively on the left and right . in this representation ,",
    "the @xmath588-invariant quadratic form is @xmath589 and the condition for @xmath587 not to be a null vector for the quadratic form is that it should be an invertible matrix .",
    "but any two invertible matrices are equivalent under the action of @xmath590 ( @xmath552 acts on the @xmath584 matrix @xmath587 by left multiplication , while @xmath17 acts by scaling @xmath591 , @xmath592 ; we must divide by @xmath17 since we view @xmath587 as an element of the projective space @xmath570 ) .",
    "so as claimed , the complement of the quadric in @xmath570 is a single @xmath552 orbit .",
    "although the left action of @xmath552 on the space of invertible @xmath584 matrices is free , when we project to @xmath570 , the action becomes only semi - free ( that is , the stabilizer of a point is a finite group ) . in fact , @xmath547 contains a central subgroup @xmath479 consisting of the matrices @xmath459 and @xmath119 .",
    "these matrices act freely on @xmath570 and the subgroup of @xmath552 that leaves fixed a point in @xmath570 that is not on the quadric is @xmath479 .",
    "so if @xmath289 corresponds to a point not on the quadric , then its cohomology is @xmath479-graded , but not @xmath474-graded .",
    "so we can summarize what three - dimensional topological field theories arise from this construction .",
    "there is the usual @xmath14 family of theories that arise by compactification from four dimensions .",
    "two points in this family are the @xmath157-model and @xmath149-model of @xmath1 ( which are equivalent , respectively , to the @xmath149-model and @xmath157-model of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the generic point in this family corresponds to what is sometimes called quantum geometric langlands ( of @xmath1 or equivalently of @xmath0 ) .",
    "there is one more theory that does _ not _ arise by compactification of a four - dimensional theory .",
    "it is only @xmath479 graded and as we explain momentarily does not distinguish @xmath1 from @xmath0 .",
    "what we have established so far is really that by varying @xmath289 at a fixed value of the coupling parameter @xmath483 of the theory , we can construct only one new theory . in section [ vanishing ] , we will show that because of vanishing of a certain element of cohomology , the parameter @xmath483 is irrelevant in the new theory .",
    "this means that the new theory is really unique .",
    "this new @xmath479-graded theory appears to be a candidate for the one studied in @xcite .",
    "electric - magnetic duality acts nontrivially on the @xmath14 that parametrizes theories that come from four dimensions .",
    "but the new theory , being unique , must be invariant under duality .",
    "in particular , as duality exchanges @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the new three - dimensional theory defined for @xmath1 is equivalent to the same theory defined for @xmath0 .    starting with any point on the quadric @xmath571 , corresponding to one of the usual theories studied in ( ordinary or quantum ) geometric langlands , and making an infinitesimal perturbation away from @xmath571 , one lands on the same generic @xmath552 orbit .",
    "so the same theory ",
    "the one that is symmetrical between @xmath1 and @xmath0  can be reached ( after compactification to three dimensions ) by an infinitesimal perturbation of any of the theories of four - dimensional origin .",
    "the required perturbation reduces the @xmath474-grading to a @xmath479-grading .      as explained in section [ complication ] , the reason that the gauge coupling parameter @xmath483 is not completely irrelevant in the twisted four - dimensional theories that lead to geometric langlands is that the instanton number @xmath593 is @xmath289-invariant and not of the form @xmath447  that is , it represents a nontrivial cohomology class of @xmath289 . adding a multiple of @xmath594 to the lagrangian gives a non - trivial deformation of the theory .",
    "it turns out that when we perturb slightly away from the quadric , this cohomology class disappears . as a result ,",
    "the parameter @xmath483 becomes irrelevant , completing the justification of the claim that after compactification to three dimensions on a circle , there is precisely one new @xmath479-graded topological field theory that we can make .",
    "the fact that the cohomology class disappears under perturbation away from the quadric can be anticipated as follows . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the deformation by the cohomology class @xmath594 is equivalent to the deformation associated with a change in the linear combination @xmath478 .",
    "we have already seen that once we move away from @xmath571 , the deformation by changing @xmath289 becomes trivial , so the deformation by @xmath594 must also become trivial . instead of relying on this sort of argument , we prefer to be more explicit .    in general ,",
    "for a cohomology class to disappear under an infinitesimal perturbation , it must annihilate another cohomology class whose @xmath474-grading differs by @xmath460 ( if the perturbation preserves a @xmath474-grading , as in the case usually considered ) , or at least one that has the opposite @xmath479 grading ( if the perturbation preserves only a @xmath479-grading , as in the case considered here ) . in the four - dimensional topological field theories related to geometric langlands , there is no four - form valued cohomology class of @xmath289 with an odd grading that could possibly cancel @xmath595 in the cohomology . however , once we compactify to three dimensions , there is such a class .",
    "our construction on @xmath518 made use of a vector field @xmath548 that generates the rotation of @xmath507 .",
    "there is a natural @xmath548-invariant one - form @xmath596 on @xmath507 with @xmath597 .",
    "this enables us to consider the expression @xmath598 , which is a @xmath289 cohomology class of degree 1 .",
    "if the four - dimensional @xmath474-graded theory is restricted to four - manifolds of the form @xmath599 , then in addition to the usual complex modulus corresponding to the cohomology class @xmath594 ( this modulus is tangent to the usual @xmath14 family ) , there is an additional odd modulus corresponding to @xmath600 .",
    "but when one perturbs away from the quadric @xmath571 to a @xmath479-graded theory , the cohomology classes @xmath594 and @xmath601 both disappear , as we will now argue .",
    "let @xmath289 be the topological supersymmetry generator corresponding to a point in @xmath571 ",
    "so @xmath445 and @xmath289 descends from four dimensions .",
    "pick a one - parameter deformation @xmath602 , where @xmath603 corresponds to another point in @xmath570 and @xmath604 .",
    "after possibly replacing @xmath603 by a linear combination of @xmath289 and @xmath603 , we can assume that @xmath605 and @xmath606    let @xmath607 be the chern - simons three - form .",

    "so when we pass to the cohomology of @xmath289 , the last term in ( [ kozz ] ) is trivial and this equation reduces to @xmath630 .",
    "this implies that when we perturb @xmath289 to @xmath602 , both @xmath601 and @xmath594 disappear from the cohomology .",
    "[ dorfox ] going back to four dimensions , we can select an invariant polynomial @xmath82 of degree @xmath74 and perturb the topological field theories related to geometric langlands by the @xmath289-invariant interaction @xmath631 .",
    "this perturbation has degree @xmath632 , so , for @xmath633 , it gives a @xmath634-graded theory .",
    "if we include a linear combination of such perturbations with all possible values of @xmath388 , we will get a family of four - dimensional topological field theories that ( for most simple lie groups @xmath1 ) are generically only @xmath479-graded .",
    "these theories have similar behavior under electric - magnetic duality to the @xmath474-graded theories that are usually considered in geometric langlands .",
    "it is not clear to the author whether they contain any essentially new information .",
    "an important point in section [ subtlety ] was that , with the appropriate boundary conditions at the two ends , the solution of nahm s equations on the half - open interval @xmath635 $ ] is unique .",
    "the boundary condition for @xmath636 was described in eqn .",
    "( [ zonko ] ) : @xmath233 should have a regular pole at @xmath226 , the singular part being @xmath637 where @xmath638 are the images of the @xmath639 generators under a principal embedding @xmath640",
    ".    the boundary condition at @xmath252 was not explained in section [ gaugetheory ] , but as we will explain , its effect is that the solutions of nahm s equations on @xmath635 $ ] with the conditions we will want at @xmath252 are tautologically the same as the solutions of nahm s equations on the open half - line @xmath641 with a requirement that @xmath642 at infinity .    kronheimer @xcite investigated nahm s equations on the open half - line with these conditions at infinity , the requirement being instead that @xmath233 is conjugate at infinity to a specified triple of elements of @xmath643 .",
    "it is possible to modify our boundary conditions on both the @xmath157-model and @xmath149-model side so as to arrive at this generalization .",
    "the necessary facts are mostly presented in @xcite .",
    "but we will omit this generalization here . ]",
    "( including the regular nahm pole at @xmath226 ) and showed that the solution is unique .",
    "so once we explain how our problem on the half - open interval @xmath635 $ ] is related to kronheimer s problem on the half - line @xmath641 , the uniqueness claimed in section [ subtlety ] will follow .",
    "actually , kronheimer considered a more general problem in which @xmath644 is taken to be an arbitrary homomorphism , not necessarily related to a principal embedding",
    ". we will need to know about the opposite case @xmath645 . for this choice",
    ", there is no pole at @xmath226 , so one is studying solutions of nahm s equations on the closed half - line @xmath646 . in this case , the moduli space of solutions of nahm s equations turns out to be a hyper - kahler manifold @xmath647 that in any of its complex structures is equivalent to the nilpotent cone in the complex lie algebra @xmath648 . the moduli space @xmath649 has @xmath0 symmetry for an easily understood reason : if @xmath645 , then the group @xmath0 acts on the solutions of nahm s equations in the obvious fashion @xmath650 .",
    "( for @xmath651 , the group that acts is the subgroup of @xmath0 that commutes with the image of @xmath248 . )",
    "the hyper - kahler moment map for the @xmath0 action on @xmath649 turns out to be @xmath652 .",
    "all this has the following trivial generalization .",
    "if we solve nahm s equations on the half - line @xmath653 ( rather than @xmath646 ) , we get an isomorphic hyper - kahler manifold , the moment map for the @xmath0 action now being @xmath654    here we will only require the extreme cases that @xmath248 is either 0 or a principal embedding . the general result @xcite , however , for any @xmath248 , is that the moduli space of solutions of nahm s equations turns out to be , as a complex manifold in any of its complex structures , the slodowy slice transverse to the nilpotent element @xmath655 of @xmath648 .",
    "now we need to describe the boundary conditions at @xmath252 in the construction of section [ subtlety ] .",
    "the relevant notion of a boundary condition is more extended than one may be accustomed to in the world of partial differential equations , for example .",
    "a boundary condition in a quantum field theory defined on @xmath656-manifolds is a choice of how to extend the definition to @xmath656-manifolds with boundary in such a way that all the usual axioms of local quantum field theory are preserved .",
    "this notion allows us to include on the boundary a @xmath657-dimensional quantum field theory .",
    "it is only interesting to do that , however , if the @xmath657-dimensional boundary theory is coupled in some way to the `` bulk '' theory .    one might think that this notion of a boundary condition is too broad . however , it is shown in @xcite that this extended notion of a boundary condition is unavoidable if one wishes electric - magnetic duality to act on boundary conditions , since the dual of a more conventional boundary condition can very well be a boundary condition in this extended sense .",
    "for example , as shown in @xcite , the dual of dirichlet boundary conditions in @xmath1-gauge theory is a boundary condition in @xmath0 gauge theory that involves coupling of the @xmath0 gauge fields to a very special superconformal field theory @xmath658 that is supported on the boundary . for our purposes",
    ", @xmath658 has the following important properties .",
    "it has @xmath659 as a group of global symmetries .",
    "the higgs branch of vacua of @xmath658 turns out to be the kronheimer manifold @xmath647 , and the coulomb branch of vacua is the dual kronheimer manifold @xmath660 .",
    "as is explained in @xcite , for a boundary condition in @xmath0 gauge theory that is obtained by coupling to a boundary theory with @xmath0 symmetry , the appropriate boundary condition in nahm s equations is to set @xmath233 equal on the boundary to @xmath661 , the moment map for the action of @xmath0 on the higgs branch : @xmath662 this equation looks just like ( [ getz ] ) , even though the two equations have a completely different meaning . in ( [ olp ] ) , @xmath233 is a solution of nahm s equations on the interval @xmath635 $ ] where the quantum field theory is defined . in eqn .",
    "( [ getz ] ) , @xmath233 is a solution of nahm s equations on the half - line @xmath653 .",
    "it defines a point in the higgs branch of the boundary theory .",
    "nevertheless , if we simply combine the two equations , we see that , even though their interpretations are completely different , the solution of nahm s equations on @xmath635 $ ] agrees at @xmath252 with the solution of nahm s equations on @xmath653 . hence , they fit together to a single solution of nahm s equations on the open half - line @xmath641 .",
    "nahm s equations ensure that this solution is smooth near @xmath252 .",
    "it has the singular behavior ( [ ploonko ] ) near @xmath226 , and vanishes for @xmath663 since this is a characteristic of the moduli space @xmath660 .",
    "according to the first result of kronheimer mentioned at the beginning of this subsection , nahm s equations have a unique solution ( namely @xmath254 ) obeying these conditions .",
    "this is the uniqueness asserted in section [ subtlety ] .",
    "the examples that we have described here of the role of nahm s equations in duality of boundary conditions in @xmath144 super yang - mills theory are really only the tip of the iceberg .",
    "much more can be found in @xcite .",
    "the full story involves , among other things , the more general moduli spaces defined by kronheimer for an arbitrary @xmath664 .      in section [ realdetails ]",
    ", we exploited in a rather technical way the special properties of the dual of dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "we perhaps should not leave the subject without explaining that the dual of dirichlet boundary conditions actually plays a rather basic role in the geometric langlands correspondence .",
    "we start by explaining intuitively why the dual of dirichlet boundary conditions should be important . in geometric langlands ,",
    "one considers the @xmath149-model of @xmath144 super yang - mills theory , compactified on a riemann surface @xmath27 , for gauge group @xmath0 .",
    "one compares it to the @xmath157-model of @xmath1 on the same riemann surface .",
    "the most basic branes in the @xmath149-model are branes associated with a homomomorphism @xmath665 .",
    "one would like to understand their duals in the @xmath157-model .",
    "then the brane @xmath667 is simply the one that is defined by dirichlet boundary conditions for the complexified gauge field @xmath151 ( extended to all other fields to preserve the topological supersymmetry of the @xmath149-model ) .",
    "after all , dirichlet boundary conditions say that @xmath152 should be trivialized on the boundary , so that the boundary data correspond to a trivial flat connection representing the trivial homomorphism from @xmath668 to @xmath69 .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions can be considered without any compactification , as indeed was done in @xcite .",
    "thus the brane @xmath667 associated to the trivial flat connection without a nahm pole has a universal meaning , independent of any choice of riemann surface @xmath27 .",
    "( this is also true for the analogous problem with a specified nahm pole . )",
    "let @xmath669 be the @xmath157-brane that is dual to @xmath667 .",
    "then @xmath669 , like @xmath667 , can be defined universally without any choice of compactification .",
    "as explained in @xcite and as we already stated in section [ realdetails ] , @xmath669 is defined by coupling @xmath1 gauge theory to a three - dimensional superconformal field theory @xmath670 that has @xmath671 global symmetry .",
    ", in this sense , is @xmath658 .",
    "indeed , @xmath672 was one of the fundamental examples considered in @xcite .",
    "] one uses the @xmath1 symmetry of @xmath670 to couple it to @xmath1 gauge fields in bulk .",
    "this leaves a @xmath0 global symmetry , matching the fact that @xmath0 is the automorphism group of dirichlet boundary conditions ( or of the trivial homomorphism @xmath673 ) in @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "the duality between @xmath667 and @xmath669 holds before or after compactification on a riemann surface @xmath27 .",
    "however , after compactification , we can consider a twisted version of the picture in which we twist using the automorphism group @xmath69 , which @xmath667 and @xmath669 have in common . on the @xmath149-model side , the twisted version of",
    "the picture simply involves a choice of homomorphism @xmath665 . to each choice of @xmath666 ,",
    "one defines a @xmath149-brane @xmath674 that is locally isomorphic to @xmath667 , but globally is obtained from @xmath667 by twisting by the homomorphism @xmath666 from @xmath668 to the automorphism group @xmath69 of @xmath667 .",
    "( the statement that @xmath674 is `` locally '' isomorphic to @xmath667 means that they are isomorphic locally along @xmath27 . )",
    "let us denote as @xmath675 the dual of @xmath674",
    ". then @xmath675 is obtained from @xmath669 exactly as @xmath674 was obtained from @xmath667 : by twisting via a homomorphism from @xmath668 to the automorphism group .",
    "this makes sense since @xmath667 and @xmath669 have the same automorphism group @xmath0 .",
    "so the dual of any @xmath674 can be constructed if one understands the three - dimensional superconformal field theory @xmath670 that is the main ingredient in describing the dual of dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "thus , a knowledge of @xmath670 gives the same sort of results that one would expect mathematically from a description of the universal kernel of geometric langlands .",
    "this universal kernel is supposed to be a brane in the product theory @xmath676 that has certain universal properties .",
    "in fact , @xmath670 can be used to construct the appropriate brane .",
    "this can be done prior to compactification , and thus independent of any choice of @xmath27 .",
    "the relevant construction is quite simple and was described in section 4 of @xcite .",
    "one divides @xmath413 into two half - spaces separated by a copy of @xmath223 , supported at , say , @xmath226 , where @xmath192 is one of the euclidean coordinates of @xmath413 . for @xmath677 ,",
    "one places @xmath144 super yang - mills theory with gauge group @xmath1 ; for @xmath243 , one places the same theory with gauge group @xmath0 . at @xmath226 ,",
    "one places the theory @xmath670 . using its @xmath671 global symmetries",
    ", it can be coupled to @xmath1 gauge theory on the left and @xmath678 gauge theory on the right .",
    "moreover , the coupling can be chosen so that the whole construction is supersymmetric  to be more precise , invariant under a subgroup @xmath679 of the symmetry supergroup @xmath680 of @xmath144 super yang - mills theory .",
    "one can pick a fermionic generator of @xmath679 that for @xmath677 generates the topological supersymmetry of the @xmath157-model of @xmath1 , and for @xmath243 generates the corresponding symmetry of the @xmath149-model of @xmath0 .    to get closer to the usual mathematical point of view",
    ", we can `` fold '' @xmath413 along the hypersurface @xmath226 , so that the @xmath1 and @xmath678 gauge groups now both are supported at @xmath677 and there is nothing for @xmath243 . in this description , then , the theory @xmath670 provides a boundary condition in the product of @xmath1 and @xmath0 gauge theories .",
    "after topological twisting , this boundary condition corresponds to a brane @xmath681 in the product of the @xmath157-model of @xmath1 and the @xmath149-model of @xmath0 . like the branes @xmath667 and @xmath669 discussed above ,",
    "@xmath681 can be defined in a universal way without any compactification .",
    "this indeed was the viewpoint in @xcite , where properties were discussed that correspond to the desired universal properties in geometric langlands .",
    "the idea of connecting the langlands correspondence with gauge theory was first proposed in the 1970 s by m. f. atiyah ( motivated by the observation that the goddard - nuyts - olive dual group is the same as the langlands dual group ) .",
    "i am grateful to him for introducing me to those ideas at that time .",
