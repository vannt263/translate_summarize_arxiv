    "supersymmetry ( susy ) has been considered an extended symmetry beyond standard model ( sm ) to solve the gauge hierarchy problem , to stabilize the scalar sector , and to provide a theoretical ground for possible unification of gravity with all other fundamental forces . however , minimum supersymetrically standard model ( mssm ) predicts plethora of new superpartner particles , but none of them has been observed yet . therefore soft terms are introduced to break susy but keep the feature of taming the quadratic divergence .",
    "unfortunately , it is well known that at the electroweak ( ew ) scale the softly broken susy generates many unwanted phenomenological problems , such as flavor changing neutral currents , cp violation , and so on .",
    "motivated by the string landscape scenario and the cosmological constant problem , arkani - hamed and dimopoulos have recently proposed a scenario @xcite ( dubbed split susy ) that susy is broken at an energy scale way beyond the collider search and could be even near the scale of the grand unification theory ( gut ) . as a result",
    "the scalar superpartners of standard model fermions are all super heavy . on the other hand ,",
    "fermions are protected by symmetries , such as , to be more specifically , chiral symmetry , r - symmetry and pq symmetry , so they acquire masses around electroweak to tev or so .",
    "by doing so , the phenomenological problems of susy at the ew scale can be avoided .",
    "however , the existence of a cp - even sm like higgs with mass around @xmath3 gev requires a fine tuning in the higgs potential . to address this fine tuning problem",
    ", they argue that extreme fine turning is required for solving the cosmological constant problem which is viewed as choosing a stringy ground state with small cosmological constant from an extreme huge pool of vacuum candidates . admitting this kind of fine tuning ,",
    "one is no longer worried about the naturalness principle and the fine turning in the higgs sector .",
    "( recently it was pointed out by @xcite that extra fine tuning is needed to get a reasonable values for @xmath4 . )",
    "phenomenologically , the characteristics of the split susy can be summarized as following .",
    "( 1 ) all scalars , except the cp - even sm like higgs , are super heavy @xmath5 gev - @xmath6 . ( 2 )",
    "gaugino masses are around the ew scale to tev protected by r - symmetry ( pq symmetry ) .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath7 parameter is around the ew scale such that the lightest neutralino can annihilate effectively to give the dark matter density .",
    "( 4 ) coupling unification still works , mainly due to the gauginos contributions .",
    "there are already many discussions on detecting or testing the split susy by accessible and/or near future experiments @xcite , on the connection with the neutrino masses @xcite , and on the implication in cosmology and astrophysics@xcite . in this note",
    "we will only focus on the inherent contributions to edm in the split susy scenario .    in split susy , the gaugino masses parameters , @xmath8 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 gauge group respectively , as well as the higgsino mixing mass parameter @xmath7 , are all around the ew scale .",
    "consequently , the charginos and neutralinos have masses at the same scale .",
    "these parameters are generally complex with respect to each other , and their mutual phases can not be removed by redefinition of fields .",
    "if so , the cp violation in the gaugino - higgsino sector is genuine , and it can give rise to the edm of an elementary particle at low energy .",
    "nevertheless , all possible one - loop contributions to edm are highly suppressed by the super heavy scalar mass in the loop .",
    "thus the leading sources of the edm starts at the two - loop level where sm particles and ew charginos and neutralinos run in the loops .",
    "a study of possible edm due to the complex pseudo - scalar coupling of light neutral higgs , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop](a ) , has been done in @xcite .",
    "this type of edm will be referred as @xmath11 .",
    "however , we want to point out that the @xmath0 gauge boson edm , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop](b ) , can give same order of magnitude contribution to edm of sm fermion , denoted as @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , this edm contribution , @xmath12 , is independent of the higgs mass .",
    "in addition , the two diagrams actually depend on different combinations of cp violating phases and therefore , in some occasions , @xmath12 still contributes even when the cp violation effect in @xmath11 vanishes accidentally .",
    "note that the two types of contributions are totally determined by 7 free parameters : @xmath4 , three mass parameters , @xmath13 , and three arbitrary cp phases @xmath14 .    in mssm , a similar 2-loop @xmath15 diagram with one of the @xmath16 lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop](b ) substituted by @xmath17 turns out to give more important edm contribution than @xmath12 for a large range of the parameter space@xcite .",
    "but such contribution vanishes in the split susy due to the decoupled super heavy charged higgs .",
    "we will carefully study the resulting edm from the combined two contributions , mentioned above , within a reasonable parameter space .",

    "however , split susy predicts the @xmath73 to be roughly @xmath74e cm , which is 6 to 7 orders of magnitude lower than the current limit@xcite and it will be a great challenge for the newly proposed @xmath73 measurement@xcite .",
    "now we turn our attention to the neutron edm .    in mssm ,",
    "usually the chromo dipole moment is the dominant contribution to the neutron edm due to the large @xmath75 of the strong interaction .",

    "given the nonperturbative nature of hadron physics , it is not clear how to make reliable theoretical prediction on the neutron edm under control .",
    "however , as an order of magnitude estimation , the quark model prediction @xmath76 can be used to give a rough estimation of the neutron edm . by trivially scaling up the fermion masses and replacing the fermion charge accordingly , we can express the neutron edm as [ eq : quarkm ] d^h^0_n = -(8 m_u + m_d 9 m_e ) d_e^h^0 , d^w_n = -(4 m_u + m_d 3 m_e ) d_e^w . in arriving at the last expression of @xmath77 ,",
    "we have ignored masses of @xmath44 doublet partners , the @xmath78 and @xmath79 quarks , in the loop .",
