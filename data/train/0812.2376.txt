    "in this paper we consider the system of @xmath0 elliptic equations @xmath1 for @xmath2 .",
    "it models the steady states of @xmath3 organisms , each of density @xmath4 , which coexist in a smooth , connected , bounded domain @xmath5 ; their dynamics is ruled out by internal growth @xmath6 s and mutual competition of lotka - volterra type with parameter @xmath7 .",
    "systems of this form have attracted considerable attention both in ecology and social science since they furnish a relatively simple model to study the behavior of @xmath3 populations competing for the same resource @xmath8 .",
    "one of the main question is to investigate whether _ coexistence _ may occur , namely the existence of equilibrium configurations where all the densities @xmath4 are strictly positive on sets of positive measure , or the internal dynamic leads to _ extinction _ , that is steady states where one or more densities are null .",
    "many results are nowadays available , dealing mainly with @xmath9 populations .",
    "we quote among others @xcite , where for logistic internal growth @xmath10 , both the situation are proved to be possible depending on the relations between the diffusion rates and the coefficients of intra  specific and of inter  specific competitions , see also @xcite .    a different perspective is proposed in @xcite , where the authors study the effect of very strong competition , letting the parameter @xmath11 growing indefinitely .",
    "it is observed ( see section  [ sec : asymptotic - analysis ] ) that the presence of large interactions of competitive type produces , in the limit configuration as @xmath12 , the _ spatial segregation _ of the densities , meaning that if @xmath13 solves  ( [ modellk ] ) , then @xmath14 converges ( in a suitable sense ) to some @xmath4 which satisfies @xmath15 a number of qualitative properties of the possible coexistence states @xmath4 and their supports is proved in @xcite , with the aim of describing the way the territory is partitioned by the segregated populations .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the above quoted papers for details on the regularity theory so far developed and to @xcite for some applications .",
    "a further point of interest is to establish if coexistence of the species is possible in a segregated configuration : do all the species survive when the intra specific competition becomes larger and larger ?",
    "the answer can not be positive in general : @xcite shows that in any _ convex domain _ the only stable configurations are those where only one specie is alive .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in @xcite , the strict positivity of each component in the limiting configuration is guaranteed by simply forcing non - homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath16 with @xmath17 on a set of positive @xmath18measure .",
    "coexistence results for competing systems under more natural homogeneous boundary conditions are obtained in @xcite for the dirichlet case @xmath19 with interactions of the form @xmath20 . to avoid the extinction predicted by @xcite , a special class of non - convex domains close to a union of @xmath3 disjoint balls",
    "is considered .",
    "suitable non - degeneracy assumptions on the @xmath6 s allow the application of a domain perturbation technique envisaged in @xcite which strongly relies on the continuity of the eigenvalues of the laplace operator with respect to the domain .",
    "it is well known that such a property does not hold in the case of neumann boundary conditions , see for instance @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to treat neumann no - flux boundary conditions , a different approach is needed .",
    "this is precisely the aim of the present paper : we deal with system coupled with @xmath21 in a class of non - convex domains @xmath22 suitably approximating a given domain @xmath23 composed by @xmath3 disjoint open sets , see figure [ fig : dd ] .    due to the variational structure of problem , the following _ free energy _",
    "functional @xmath24 given by the sum of the internal energies of the @xmath3 densities @xmath4 , each having internal potential @xmath25 , is naturally associated to the system .",
    "our analysis will highlight how the coexistence of all the densities is connected to the following minimization problem : _ finding local minimizers of @xmath26 in the class of of segregated states _ @xmath27",
    "the problem of the existence of the _ global minimum _ of @xmath26 in @xmath28 was investigated in @xcite under the non - homogeneous conditions . as we shall see in theorem [ p : trivialglobmin ] , the global minimizer under homogeneous boundary conditions is in general trivial , namely a @xmath3-tuple with all but one component identically null .",
    "hence , the only possibility for finding a _ stable _ coexistence solution where all the @xmath3 densities survive , consists in looking for _ local _ minimizers of @xmath29 , see problem @xmath30 below .    exploiting the variational character of the interaction term in and developing a suitable domain perturbation technique , in this paper we give positive answer to both questions of minimization of @xmath29 and occurrence of coexistence states for the system .",
    "our main result can be summarized as follows : under suitable assumptions on @xmath6 s ensuring the existence of a non - degenerate solution to the system on the unperturbed domain @xmath23 ( see below ) , _ for all @xmath31 close enough to @xmath23 and large parameter @xmath11 , there exists @xmath32 solution to in @xmath31 , whose limit configuration as @xmath33 is a segregated coexistence state @xmath34 with @xmath3 positive components ( i.e. each component @xmath35 and @xmath4 is strictly positive on a set of positive measure ) , characterized as a local minimizer of the free energy  @xmath36 . _    before stating rigorously our assumptions and main results , a further remark is in order . as observed in @xcite ( see also theorem [ t : extremality ] ) any @xmath34 which is a local minimizer of the free energy @xmath29 on @xmath37 , is also a solution of the following system of distributional inequalities : @xmath38        \\displaystyle\\int_{\\omega}\\big(\\nabla \\widehat u        _ i(x)\\nabla\\phi(x)+\\widehat u_i(x ) \\phi(x)-\\widehat f(\\widehat        u _",
    "i(x))\\phi(x))dx\\geq 0 ,      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] @xmath2 , for any non - negative @xmath39 , where we have denoted @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the link between systems of this form and population dynamics has been pointed out in @xcite : as a matter of fact _ all _ the limiting configurations as @xmath33 of the solutions to are solutions to .",
    "in other words , the possibility of coexistence of many species ruled out by strong competition is governed by the system of distributional inequalities : its independent study is thus crucial in population dynamics . in this perspective",
    "our main result can be reformulated in the following way : _ the system of differential inequalities has a solution @xmath42 with @xmath3 positive components . _",
