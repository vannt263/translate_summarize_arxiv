    "to understand when and how stars and galaxies formed in the universe is one of the most fundamental issues in modern astronomy . the energy emitted from stars as a result of nuclear fusion",
    "is radiated in two modes : direct stellar emission ranging from optical to near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths , and emission in mid- and far - infrared ( mir and fir ) wavelengths from dust particles heated by stellar radiation field .",
    "faint galaxy counts and the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) , as well as the properties of galaxies in the local universe , give us important clues to understand galaxy formation .    in",
    "optical / nir wavelengths , the sensitivity of existing telescopes now reaches a depth sufficient to resolve more than 8090% of cbr from galaxies ( totani et al .",
    "2001a ) , thanks to very deep optical surveys such as the hubble deep fields ( hdfs : williams et al . 1996",
    "; williams et al . 2000 ) and the nir surveys such as the subaru deep field ( sdf : maihara et al . 2001 ) .",
    "there are a number of theoretical models in various approaches to be compared with these data , and in fact these data can be reasonably explained in the framework of the big - bang cosmology and structure formation induced by the cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "in contrast , infrared observations have not yet reached such depth and star formation activity hidden by dust extinction is still poorly known , despite the dramatic progress of observations achieved by satellites such as _ iras _",

    "forthcoming projects such as _ sirtf _ , _ astro - f _ , sofia , _ herschel space observatory _ , _ ngst _ , and alma would bring about revolutionary progress from this situation .",
    "comparison of these data with theoretical models of infrared galaxies will be the key to understand the `` dark side '' of galaxy formation in the next decade of extragalactic astronomy .",
    "theoretical modeling of galaxy formation and evolution has a long history . in optical / nir wavelengths",
    ", most theoretical modelings can be roughly divided into two categories : the so - called `` backwards '' approach and `` _ ab initio _ '' approach . in the former approach ( tinsley 1980 ; yoshii & takahara 1988 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1990 ; rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni 1990 ; yoshii & peterson 1991 , 1995 ; pozzetti et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ; jimenez & kashlinsky 1999 ; totani & yoshii 2000 ) , the luminosity function of local galaxies is used as an input to normalize the number density of galaxies .",
    "the local properties of galaxies such as multi - band colors and chemical properties are also used to construct a reasonable model of star formation history and luminosity evolution of galaxies based on the stellar population synthesis method .",
    "the evolution is then probed backwards into the past to predict observables such as galaxy counts and redshift distributions .",
    "the formation epoch and merging history of galaxies can not be predicted in this framework , and hence they are introduced as phenomenological parameters that can be inferred from comparison with observational data . in the latter approach ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1993 ; cole et al .",
    "1994 , 2000 ; somerville & primack 1999 ; nagashima et al . 2001 ) , on the other hand , the formation epoch and merging history of galaxies are predicted by the standard theory of structure formation in the cdm universe . in these models",
    "the local properties such as luminosity function are outputs of the model which should be compared with observations . however , although the formation and evolution of dark matter halos are rather well understood and can be properly predicted , our knowledge about baryonic processes such as star formation , supernova feedback , or galaxy merging is still very poor , and a number of phenomenological parameters must be incorporated , making the comparison of a model and observed data rather complicated .    both of these two approaches have been used also to make predictions of infrared galaxy counts and infrared cbr ( see franceschini et al .",
    "1994 for the former , guiderdoni et al . 1998 and",
    "devriendt & guiderdoni 2000 for the latter , and tan , silk , & balland 1999 for a somewhat hybrid approach between the two ) .",
    "however , because of our poor knowledge and understanding of dust formation and emission , there are considerable difficulties in theoretically predicting infrared luminosity , spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , and their evolution of dust emission , compared with the optical / nir modeling based on the stellar population synthesis method .",
    "this is the motivation of another `` empirical '' approach in the mir and fir wavelengths . in this kind of approach ,",
    "the infrared luminosity evolution is introduced by some phenomenological functional forms and constraints on luminosity evolution is derived from comparison with observed data ( beichman & helou 1991 ; oliver , rowan - robinson & saunders 1992 ; blain & longair 1993 , 1996 ; pearson & rowan - robinson 1996 ; malkan & stecker 1998 , 2001 ; takeuchi et al .",

    "2001 ; franceschini et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "there is yet another approach so - called `` cosmic chemical evolution '' , in which the universe is treated as a uniform medium and the mean gas consumption by stars in the whole universe is considered ( pei & fall 1995 ; fall , charlot , & pei 1996 ; pei , fall , & hauser 1999 ; sadat , guiderdoni , & silk 2001 ) .",
    "the cosmic star formation history is determined by the redshift evolution of the cosmic mass density of neutral gas and the cosmic mean metallicity , which is inferred from quasar absorption line systems .",
    "although this is a simple and beautiful approach to predict cbr ( but not galaxy counts ) , several problems exist in this kind of approach , which could be serious especially in modeling infrared radiation from dust .",
    "first , quasar absorption systems are inevitably biased to gas - rich systems , i.e. , systems in which star formation has been relatively inefficient , and hence their mean metallicity does not necessarily represent the mean of the whole universe .",
    "for example , if an elliptical galaxy has formed at @xmath6 , this galaxy has been already in passive evolution phase at @xmath4 .",
    "then it can never be observed as a quasar absorption system because of complete exhaustion of interstellar gas , although significant stars and metals have been produced .",
    "galaxies in dusty starburst phase may not be traced by absorption line systems , either , because background quasars may be completely extincted and can not be observed .",
    "therefore , the metallicity and star formation activity observed in absorption line systems must be an underestimate of the true mean in the universe .",
    "furthermore , extinction by interstellar dust and reradiation in infrared bands are very sensitively dependent on dust opacity and its geometrical distribution within a galaxy , but this important information is completely missed .    in this paper",
    "we construct a model of infrared galaxy counts and cbr based on the backwards approach for luminosity evolution of galaxies , by extending the model for optical / nir galaxy counts ( totani & yoshii 2000 , hereafter ty00 ) to include dust emission component in infrared bands . after the work by franceschini et al .",
    "( 1994 , f94 hereafter ) , only a limited number of models have been published based on this approach covering fir bands , while there has been a dramatic increase of quality and quantity of observational data in the local universe as well as for faint / high-@xmath3 galaxies .",
    "although the backwards approach has a disadvantage that formation epoch and merger history must be treated phenomenologically , it has an advantage that the number of model parameters is much fewer , and connection of the model galaxies to the local galaxy populations is clearer , than the _ ab initio _ approach .",
    "another reason for the relatively low activity of work in this direction is the difficulty of constructing realistic evolutionary models that can consistently describe both the optical and infrared data at the local universe as well as high-@xmath3 , as argued by franceschini et al .",
    "this is indeed what motivated more empirical studies confined to the infrared bands .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explain the bulk of optical and infrared data consistently by realistic evolutionary models of known and relatively normal galaxy populations at the local universe , without introducing hypothetical populations or parametric description of luminosity evolution .",
    "an important improvement of our model from the f94 model is that mass scale dependence is introduced for dust extinction and reradiation , based on the size - luminosity relation of galaxies observed in the optical bands . in the f94 model",
    ", there was no physical difference in model galaxies of a given type with different masses ; massive galaxies were simply a scaled - up version of smaller objects .",
    "we will show that this point is essential to understand various local properties of infrared galaxies .",
    "another important characteristic of this work is modeling of the infrared sed evolution . in most of the previous infrared models , including _ ab initio _ and empirical approaches , the dust sed is empirically modeled in such a way that the dust sed is a one - parameter family specified by the total infrared luminosity of galaxies .",
    "the relation between the dust sed and luminosity , which is observed in local infrared galaxies , is characterized by a gradual increase of characteristic dust temperature @xmath0 with infrared luminosity @xmath1 and is often expressed simply as a linear relation between @xmath0 and @xmath7 ( e.g.  smith et al .",
    "1987 ; soifer & neugebauer 1991 ) .",
    "however in this paper , we argue that this relation is not physically warranted for high-@xmath3 galaxies . in a physical sense , the luminosity is _ extensive _ , i.e. , a quantity which is dependent upon the amount of substance present in the system . on the other hand ,",
    "the dust temperature is _ intensive _ , which is a specific characteristic of the system and is independent of the amount of material concerned .",
    "therefore these two must not be related by only one sigle relation .",
    "at least there should be another extensive quantity such as the total mass of dust in a galaxy @xmath8 . in the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relation , the extensive scale of an object is completely missed .",
    "the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relation of local infrared galaxies should be considered as a projection of the plane between @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath8 . here",
    "we will construct a model on physical basis to describe the infrared luminosity as a two - parameter family of @xmath8 and @xmath0 .",
    "the dust temperature is physically calculated , without using the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relation .",
    "in addition to the thermal emission from big grain dust , the warm / nonequilibrium components of dust emission from small grain dusts and pah features are also added to the model sed to be consistent with the observed infrared sed of galaxies .",
    "it is important to check that the model can successfully reproduce the local properties of infrared galaxies , before predicting the high-@xmath3 quantities such as counts and cbr , since in our model all the inputs are the optical / nir properties of local galaxies , and those in infrared bands are outputs predicted by the model .",
    "we will compare the model prediction with the observed properties of local infrared galaxies , such as the correlation between optical and infrared luminosity , the @xmath1-@xmath0 relation , and infrared luminosity function .",
    "indeed , we will show that our model gives a reasonable explanation for these relations as well as the scatter along the mean relation .",
    "recently granato et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have presented a very sophisticated semi - analytic model of infrared galaxy formation to calculate various properties of local infrared galaxies , although predictions for high-@xmath3 galaxies have not been made yet .",
    "they have also found that most of the observed properties can be reproduced in their model framework . however",
    ", a large number of parameters have been introduced to treat various physical processes , and the origin of the observed properties of local infrared galaxies has not been clearly discussed . here",
    "we try to shed light on the underlying physics of these properties by a model with a much fewer number of adjustable parameters .",
    "then we will make predictions of infrared galaxy counts and cbr by our backwards evolution model .",
    "we found that the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relation breaks down at high-@xmath3 , especially in the intense starbursts expected at the formation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the dust temperature should be much higher ( 4080k ) than predicted by mere extrapolation of the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relation .",
    "we will discuss the implications of our results for the star formation history of the universe , especially the formation epoch of elliptical galaxies .",
    "our result also has an interesting implication for the _ prima facie _ conflict ( stecker 2000 ) between the upper limit on mir cbr from tev gamma - ray observations and the fir cbr detections by the _ cobe _  satellite .",
    "the calculation of intergalactic optical depth of tev gamma - rays based on our model will also be presented .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows .",
    "the model of galaxy evolution in the optical bands , on which the infrared modeling is based , will be summarized in  [ section : model - optical ] .",
    "then the extension of the optical / nir model to include the dust emission is described in detail in  [ section : model - infrared ] .",
    "our model predicts local properties of infrared galaxies , and they are compared with the observations in  [ section : local ] .",
    "the predictions of faint infrared counts and cbr will be presented to be compared with observed data , in  [ section : high - z ] .",
    "implications and discussions on our results are given for several topics in  [ section : discussion ] , and finally we summarize and conclude this paper in  [ section : conclusions ] . unless otherwise stated",
    ", we will adopt a cosmological model with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "we use the same model as that used in ty00 , which is in overall agreement with the optical counts and photometric redshift distributions in hdf ( ty00 ) , and @xmath12-band counts , colors , and size distributions in the sdf ( totani et al .",
    "the detail of the model is given in ty00 and here we summarize important properties of the model . although active galactic nuclei ( agns ) may have some contributions to infrared galaxy counts and cbr , most of previous studies indicate that they are not the dominant population in counts or cbr ( e.g.  rigopoulou et al .  2000 ;",
    "barger et al .  2001 ) .",
    "therefore we will consider only normal galaxies without agns .",
    "galaxies are classified into five morphological types of e / s0 , sab , sbc , scd , and sdm , and their evolution of luminosity and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) is described by a standard galaxy evolution model in which their star formation history is determined to reproduce the present - day colors and chemical properties of galaxies ( arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; arimoto , yoshii , & takahara 1992 ) .",
    "these models include chemical evolution giving gas fraction @xmath13 and metallicity @xmath14 as a function of time and morphological type .",
    "we assume that the original dust - free sed of galaxies and its evolution do not depend on the galaxy luminosity ( or mass ) .",
    "their sed evolutions are shown in fig .  1 of ty00 .",
    "the number density and morphological type mix are determined by the type - dependent present - day @xmath15-band luminosity function , and here we adopt that of ssrs2 survey ( marzke et al . 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , galaxies in our model are identified by morphological type and present - day @xmath15 luminosity .",
    "all galaxies are assumed , for simplicity , to be formed at a single redshift , @xmath16 .",
    "we will adopt the formation redshift within a range of @xmath17 to see the sensitivity of our predictions on this parameter .",
    "a unique characteristic of the ty00 model is that the size and luminosity profile of galaxies are modeled and used to calculate the detection completeness of high-@xmath3 galaxies in a realistic way based on the formulation developed by yoshii ( 1993 ) .",
    "selection effects are very important in optical bands because galaxies are detected as extended sources and galaxy images are significantly affected by observational seeing and the cosmological dimming of surface brightness . in infrared bands ,",
    "angular resolution is generally much larger than typical apparent galaxy size , and hence they are essentially observed as point sources .",
    "therefore , extended profile of galaxies is not relevant to the detection probability . however , the size of galaxies is still very important for the opacity of dust extinction .",
    "here we summarize the modeling for galaxy sizes .",
    "we use a relation between @xmath15-band luminosity and effective radius @xmath18 to calculate a characteristic size of a galaxy as a function of its present - day @xmath15-band luminosity .",
    "the relation between the present @xmath15 luminosity @xmath19 and effective radius @xmath18 is assumed to be a power - law as @xmath20 for each galaxy type , and the normalization and @xmath21 are determined by fitting to the empirical relation observed for local galaxies .",
    "there is a considerable scatter in the empirical @xmath18-@xmath19 relation ( about 0.22 in @xmath22 ) , and this point will also be considered later .",
    "the observed @xmath19-@xmath18 relations for elliptical and spiral galaxies and fitting parameters to them can be seen in fig .  3 of ty00 .",
    "in this paper we assume that galaxy size evolves only when number evolution of galaxies takes place ( see below ) .",
    "a simple picture for galaxy evolution is a so - called pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) model in which there is no number evolution of galaxies to high redshifts .",
    "although some number evolution is naturally expected in the hierarchically clustering universe dominated by cold dark matter , it is very difficult to construct a realistic model of merger history of galaxies especially when one tries to predict infrared emission from dust .",
    "therefore , we use the ple model as our baseline model .",
    "the difficulty of modeling realistic merger history of infrared galaxies is uncertainty of size evolution of galaxies by the merger processes . in optical / nir bands ,",
    "size of galaxies is not so important when extinction is not serious and the detection incompleteness is ignored . in infrared bands , however , emission from dust is always sensitive to dust optical depth that is directly correlated with size of galaxies .",
    "therefore size evolution induced by merging processes should have significant effect on the luminosity evolution of infrared galaxies .",
    "however , size evolution in merging galaxies is hardly understood and very difficult to construct a reliable model , even in the _ ab initio _ models where merging history of dark matter halos can be predicted rather well .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will give only a simple calculation in the case of number evolution of galaxies , to grasp a rough behavior of the effects of number evolution .",
    "we introduce a simple merger model characterized by the evolution of the schechter parameters of the luminosity function , in which total optical luminosity density is conserved , i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for simplicity , we assume that all types of galaxies have the same number evolution . the size evolution is determined by assuming that stellar luminosity density within a galaxy is not changed in the merger process , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "however , this is not warranted and should be considered as a simple toy model of merging galaxies .",
    "absorptions by interstellar dust is calculated as follows .",
    "the dust opacity is assumed to be proportional to the gas column density and metallicity , and it can be expressed by a function of restframe wavelength @xmath26 , redshift @xmath3 , morphological type denoted by @xmath27 , and present - day @xmath15 luminosity @xmath28 as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the extinction curve , @xmath31 the gas column density , and @xmath14 the metallicity of interstellar gas . in this paper",
    "we use the galactic extinction curve ( e.g. , pei 1992 ) , and @xmath32 as a standard prescription . on the other hand , dependence of the extinction curve on metallicity can be taken into account by power - law interpolations based on the solar neighborhood and magellanic clouds , with @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 ( guiderdoni & rocca - volmerange 1987 ; franceschini et al .",
    "we will also try this prescription later . here",
    "the subscript mw denotes the value of the milky way at @xmath37 , and we assume that the milky way is an sbc galaxy with @xmath38 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the normalization of the optical depth is fixed by the parameter @xmath39 , which will be determined later .",
    "the column density can be expressed as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the total baryon mass of a galaxy and @xmath13 the gas mass fraction .",
    "we use the present - day @xmath42 and mass - to - luminosity ratio @xmath43 given by dust - free galaxy evolution models , to calculate @xmath41 . in a strict sense , using @xmath44 of a dust - free evolution model is an approximation , because the observed @xmath42 is already obscured by dust .",
    "however , we use this approximation for the simplicity of numerical calculations .",
    "this approximation is reasonable provided that the optical depth of extinction at @xmath15-band in present - day galaxies is not much greater than unity , which is supported by observations for the majority of nearby galaxies .",
    "however , as we will argue , more massive or luminous galaxies are more dusty and hence the above estimate of gas column density may be underestimate for the brightest galaxies .",
    "this point will be discussed later .",
    "extinction of galactic light heavily depends on the spatial distribution of dust in a galaxy .",
    "here we adopt two extreme models of spatial distribution of dust : the intervening screen model and the slab ( i.e. , the same distribution for stars and dust ) model .",
    "the attenuation factor of galactic light is @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the former and the latter , respectively .",
    "then we obtain the extincted sed of a model galaxy as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the sed of dust - free model galaxies , and the first factor of @xmath49 accounts for the fact that the observed @xmath28 is already extincted .",
    "the difference between the screen and slab models is not significant for galaxies that are not so dusty ( i.e. , optical depth @xmath50 1 ) , but is quite significant for dusty galaxies .",
    "although the slab model seems to be more reasonable , several observations of starburst galaxies can not be explained by the slab model .",
    "the observed correlation between power - law index of uv spectra and balmer line ratio of starburst galaxies indicates that the observed reddening of starburst galaxies is larger than expected from the slab model , and at least some fraction of dust should behave like a screen ( calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann 1994 , see also gordon , calzetti , & witt 1997 ) .",
    "although the screen model may seem unreasonable , it is rather reasonable that a fraction of dust behaves like a screen with a distribution more extended than stars , since strong wind from starbursts could blow out the dust particles along with interstellar gas .",
    "this could occur in the scale of star forming regions within a galaxy and/or the whole scale of a starbursting galaxy .",
    "some ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) are known to have infrared luminosity which is more than 100 times higher than optical / nir luminosity . in the slab model , this requires an enormous amount of dust with @xmath51 , while in the screen model dust amount can be more modest .",
    "therefore the screen model may be better than the slab model as a phenomenological prescription .",
    "we then use the screen model as a standard , and also use the slab model to see the dependence on the dust distributions .",
    "the model described here has already been compared comprehensively with the counts and redshift distributions of galaxies observed in optical and nir bands ( totani & yoshii 2000 ; totani et al .",
    "it has been found that all data can be reasonably explained by this model assuming a @xmath52-dominated flat cosmology .",
    "the nir data can be explained well by the ple model ( totani et al .",
    "2001c ) , while the optical data suggest some modest number evolution ( @xmath53 ) ( totani & yoshii 2000 ) .",
    "the apparently discrepant results between optical and nir bands may reflect dependence of number evolution on galaxy types , i.e. , almost no number evolution for elliptical galaxies while a stronger number evolution for late - type galaxies ( see totani et al .",
    "2001c for more detailed discussion ) .",
    "in the optical modeling described above , we have already calculated the absorption of stellar light by dust in a galaxy of given type at any redshift ( or time ) .",
    "therefore we can straightforwardly obtain the total infrared luminosity emitted by dust particles as @xmath54   \\",
    "l_\\lambda^{\\rm free}(\\lambda , z , k , l_{b,0 } ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the task remained to predict infrared flux at a given observing band is to model the sed of dust emission . in a number of previous papers , an empirical relation between the infrared sed ( or characteristic dust temperature @xmath0 ) and",
    "@xmath1 has been utilized here . however , as mentioned in introduction , it is physically unreasonable to assume that the luminosity is determined by only one quantity , i.e. , temperature .",
    "the total luminosity is an extensive quantity that is proportional to dust mass , provided that galaxies are transparent for dust emission .",
    "if a galaxy is simply scaled up in mass , the infrared luminosity should also increase but the temperature should not , which is an intensive quantity determined by the local physical state of dust particles .",
    "we have no reasonable physical explanation for this empirical relation so far , and it is not warranted at all that this can be applied to high - redshift galaxies .    rather , dust temperature should be determined by an energy balance condition ; i.e. , temperature should be a value at which dust emissivity is consistent with total amount of stellar light absorbed by dust .",
    "we assume that total infrared luminosity is dominated by thermal radiation of big grain dust , which is well described by the so - called graybody spectrum , i.e. , blackbody spectrum multiplied by the dust emissivity that is described by a power of frequency as @xmath55 , in the fir regime .",
    "this is a good approximation for local galaxies , and we will find that it holds also for high-@xmath3 galaxies whose dust temperature is higher . then the energy balance condition can be written as : @xmath56 where @xmath8 is the total dust mass in a galaxy and the dust emissivity index @xmath57 is typically @xmath57",

    "we obtain @xmath0 for any model galaxy .      the overall shape of a galaxy sed is basically determined by dust size spectrum and strength of radiation field .",
    "here we should note that the entire range of infrared sed of dust emission can not be described by a simple graybody spectrum with a single temperature .",
    "while fir peak of the infrared sed is well described by a single - temperature graybody spectrum of cold , big grain dust , the mir emission is dominated by radiation from heated small grains and pahs that are not in thermal equilibrium with ambient radiation field .",
    "because of their small heat capacity compared with the heating photon energy , these dust grains are heated stochastically by one or two photons , and their ` temperature ' temporally variates violently ( e.g. , purcell 1976 ; draine & anderson 1985 ; siebenmorgen , krgel , & mathis 1992 ; draine & li 2001 ; li & draine 2001 ) . this phenomenon makes the mir continuum very broad , and causes a power - law like spectrum .",
    "thus , it may be improper to describe the mir continuum as a superposition of multi - temperature blackbody spectra .",

    "this is equivalent to assuming that the local physical state of dust particles is specified by one parameter , i.e. , characteristic temperature .",

    "the spectrum of thermal , big grain dust particles is described by a graybody spectrum with @xmath0 .",
    "the mir continuum coming from small particles is described by a broken power law with two different indices , which are determined by the observed flux at 12 and 25 @xmath2 m compared with that in @xmath67 m at which the graybody is dominant .",

    "2001 ) , and their strength is determined by the flux at 6.75  @xmath2 m compared with the continuum emission as : @xmath73 thus we obtain the mir ",
    "fir seds of galaxies with various dust temperature .",
    "here we summarize the shape and frequency range of each component as follows : i ) a power - law component ( @xmath74 [ hz ] ) . the longer wavelength edge of this component is set to decline as a power law @xmath75 , and shorter wavelength edge is set to decline exponentially .",
    "ii ) a pah continuum obeying a power law ( @xmath76 [ hz ] ) .",
    "this component is connected to the above one smoothly .",
    "iii ) a pah band emission component ( @xmath77 [ hz ] ) .",
    "finally we added radio continuum to the ir sed along with the tight radio - fir correlation ( e.g.  helou , soifer , & rowan - robinson 1985 ; condon 1992 ) , @xmath78    figure  [ fig : sed - schem ] shows our model sed for various values of @xmath0 .",
    "a trend is seen that the mir component coming from nonequilibrium dust emission becomes weaker compared with the graybody emission from big grain dust , with increasing temperature .",
    "this trend is reasonable because the high temperature is equivalent to stronger flux of heating radiation field .",
    "when the heating intensity is stronger , the heating photons are more frequently absorbed by small dust grains , and hence more dust particles become in thermal equilibrium , making the spectrum closer to the graybody .",
    "there is also a large body of evidence that the pah are likely to be destroyed , or that their emission is severely damped , in regions of high heating intensity ( dale et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",

    "the only one parameter not yet determined is @xmath39 , the overall normalization of dust extinction . increasing @xmath39 makes galaxies more dusty and hence more luminous at infrared wavebands .",
    "infrared galaxy counts at a fixed flux then increase with @xmath39 . in this paper we set this parameter to a value at which bright infrared galaxy counts at 15 , 60 , and 90 @xmath2 m are consistent with the _ iras _   counts ( see  [ section : counts ] ) .",

    "however , it is important to check whether the model is consistent with observations for local infrared galaxies , before we discuss the result of counts and the cbr .",
    "this will be presented in the next section .",
    "here we compare our model predictions with the properties of local galaxies observed by _ iras_. we use the sample of the psc@xmath3 survey of 15411 _ iras _ galaxies selected by 60  @xmath2 m flux ( saunders et al .",

    "the data points are the 5803 galaxies with available @xmath15-band magnitudes .",
    "a clear trend can be seen that more luminous galaxies are more dusty , i.e. , showing high @xmath82 ratio . on the other hand ,",
    "the thick solid and dashed lines are our prediction averaged over all the four spiral galaxy types at @xmath37 , for the screen and slab dust , respectively . here",
    "galaxy types are averaged by their relative proportions calculated from the type - dependent @xmath15-band luminosity function .",
    "it should be noted that elliptical galaxies are not included in this prediction because they do not have dust and hence infrared emission at @xmath37 in our model .",
    "the trend of increasing @xmath83 ratio with luminosity is well reproduced by the model .",
    "this trend stems from the adopted @xmath15 luminosity versus size relation ; dust opacity , which is proportional to the metal column density , increases with @xmath19 when the locally observed @xmath19-@xmath18 relation is taken into account .",
    "consequently , more massive galaxies emit their radiation more in infrared bands .",
    "there is a considerable scatter in the @xmath19-@xmath18 relation , and this should produce scatter in the optical depth and hence a scatter along the mean @xmath1-@xmath19 relation .",
    "the thin - solid and thin - dashed curves are the predictions when the @xmath19-@xmath18 relation is shifted by @xmath84 in @xmath22 from the mean relation , where the line markings are the same with those of thick lines .",
    "the scatter is also in reasonable agreement with the observed scatter .",
    "there is some offset between the prediction and mean observed @xmath1-@xmath19 relation .",
    "we suggest that it is due to the incompleteness of the sample ; the rc3 @xmath15-magnitude is available only for galaxies bright in optical bands , which are about half of the whole infrared sample of 12324 galaxies . the galaxies without @xmath15-magnitudes are then expected to be less luminous in optical bands .",
    "this effect could lead to the lack of infrared luminous galaxies compared with the model prediction in fig .",

    "dust temperatures of the _ iras _ galaxies are estimated from their @xmath85 flux ratio based on the temperature measurement of the galactic dust by _ iras _ and _ cobe _ ( nagata et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "the thick / thin solid and dashed lines are the model predictions , with the same line markings corresponding to model predictions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l - ir - b ] .",
    "a trend of gradual increase of mean @xmath0 with @xmath1 , as well as the scatter along the mean relation , is again well reproduced by the present model .",
    "this also stems from the fact that more luminous galaxies are more dusty , as argued in the previous subsection .",
    "this fact requires that @xmath1 should increase faster than a simple scaling to @xmath8 , when the mass of galaxies is increased .",
    "considering the energy balance of @xmath86 , the dust temperature must gradually increase with @xmath8 or @xmath1 .",
    "there is a clear lack of low temperature galaxies with @xmath87k in the _ iras _  sample .",
    "we suggest that this sudden lack may come from selection effects .",
    "as we mentioned above , the dust temperature is calculated based on the 60-@xmath2 m and 100-@xmath2 m fluxes .",
    "however , the sample is selected at _ iras _",
    "60-@xmath2 m bandpass , and very cold galaxies have an ir sed peak at wavelength much longer than 60-@xmath2 m .",
    "in addition , such galaxies have low luminosity in general .",
    "therefore , cold galaxies are easily dropped by the sampling procedure in the sample used here .",
    "this is likely to be the cause of the sudden cutoff of the data on the diagram .",
    "finally we compare the model prediction of local infrared luminosity function ( at 60@xmath2 m ) to the estimated one from observations ( saunders et al .",
    "1990 ) , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ir - lf ] .",
    "it is well known that the infrared luminosity function is considerably different from that of optical galaxies that is well fitted by the schechter function .",
    "the dot - dashed line is the schechter - type luminosity function translated from the @xmath15-band luminosity function assuming @xmath88 . in sharp contrast to the rapid exponential decline of the optical luminosity function above @xmath89 , infrared luminosity function extends well beyond @xmath90 where @xmath91 is @xmath92 at 60@xmath2 m ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ir - lf ] ) . despite this intrinsic difference between the two , our model prediction with the screen dust , which is based on the @xmath15-band luminosity function having the schechter form ,",
    "well reproduces the shape of 60@xmath2 m luminosity function up to @xmath93 . here",
    ", the infrared luminosity function is calculated as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the @xmath15-band luminosity function of the @xmath27-th type galaxies .",
    "this is again due to the fact that more luminous galaxies are more dusty ; when optical luminosity is increased , infrared luminosity increases more rapidly than that , and hence an optical luminosity range is significantly broadened when it is translated into an infrared luminosity range .",
    "this effect is further strengthened for the infrared luminosity function at @xmath96 m , since the gradual increase of temperature with bolometric luminosity makes the increase of 60@xmath2 m luminosity even faster .",
    "the models fail to reproduce the data at ultra - luminous region of @xmath97 , possibly because of the contribution of peculiar starbursting galaxies under galaxy interactions , or agns .",
    "in fact observations suggest that the fraction of agns increases with infrared luminosities ( veilleux , kim , & sanders 1999 ) .",
    "our model does not take into account these rare populations of ulirgs at the local universe , since their contribution to counts or cbr is expected to be small ( rigopoulou et al . 2000 ; barger et al .",
    "2001 ) . instead",
    ", we try to explain bulk of the infrared data by the population of normal galaxies at the local universe and their ancestors at high redshifts .",
    "it should also be noted that the approximation about mass - to - light ratio @xmath98 breaks down for very bright and dusty galaxies , as mentioned in  [ section : model - optical ] . therefore our calculation is quantitatively unreliable and could be an underestimate at the brightest part of the infrared luminosity function .",
    "recently the dust mass function of local galaxies is derived by dunne et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , based on infrared - submillimeter seds .",
    "they found that the dust mass function can be fitted by the schechter function , in contrast to the 60@xmath2 m luminosity function .",
    "this is also consistent with the expectation of our model ; the dust mass is roughly proportional to the @xmath15-band luminosity unless the optical light is heavily extincted , and hence the dust mass function should be the same shape with the optical luminosity function .",
    "in the following part of this paper we will make predictions for high-@xmath3 infrared galaxies such as faint galaxy counts and cbr .",
    "first we show the evolution of infrared luminosity and big - grain dust temperature ( @xmath0 ) of model galaxies as a function of time after the formation in fig .  [",
    "fig : lt - ev ] . these models",
    "are constructed to reproduce the observed optical seds and chemical properties at the typical age of present - day galaxies ( @xmath9910gyr ) .",
    "for @xmath0 the three cases of dust temperature modeling are shown in the three panels : the screen dust , slab dust , and using the empirical relation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 of the local galaxies . here",
    ", we used the best - fit relation to the observed data as : @xmath100 for the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relation ( shown as a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : l - ir - t ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that our evolution model depends on the mass scale of galaxies .",
    "here we are showing the models for galaxies whose present - day @xmath15-band luminosity is @xmath101 , as typical giant galaxies .",
    "it can be seen that dust temperature evolution is much stronger than expected from the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relation , especially for primordial elliptical galaxies .",
    "the peak dust temperature during the starburst phase of elliptical galaxies in the slab - type dust model is @xmath1023040k , and even higher temperature of @xmath1024080k is found for the screen dust model , while the the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relation predicts @xmath103 25k in all time .",
    "this must have significant effect on the infrared sed of primordial elliptical galaxies , and hence on faint counts and cbr .    in the primordial elliptical galaxies ,",
    "the dust opacity is so high and hence @xmath104 for most of optical light .",
    "therefore , the total absorbed light , i.e. , @xmath1 is not much different between the slab and screen models .",
    "rather , the difference of the two mainly comes from the difference of amount of dust irradiated by stellar radiation . in the case of sceen dust model with @xmath105 , only @xmath106 of total amount of dust can be heated , while all dust is heated in the slab model ( eq . [ eq : f_d ] ) .",
    "consequently the temperature of the screen dust model must be higher to achieve higher luminosity per unit dust mass .",
    "it should be noted that the temperature estimate in the screen model is quite robust , in a sense that it does not depend on the total amount of dust .",
    "once @xmath107 is achieved , the dust - mass dependence is canceled between @xmath59 and @xmath8 in the energy balance equation ( eq . [ eq : energy - balance ] ) .",
    "later , we will find that the screen model shows much better agreement with counts and cbr , than the slab model .",
    "the high temperature which we obtained here for primordial elliptical galaxies should be compared with some observational estimates of dust temperature for high-@xmath3 as well as local starburst galaxies .",
    "it should be noted that the dust temperature obtained from a fit to observed spectra depends on several other parameters , such as the emissivity index @xmath57 and opacity of a galaxy to fir radiation .",
    "a same observed sed may be fitted with a higher @xmath0 when a smaller value of @xmath57 is assumed or the opacity to infrared radiation ( @xmath108 ) is significant . on the other hand , the model temperature derived here is an effective value derived from the total energy balance between dust mass and bolometric luminosity assuming @xmath109 and low opacity to infrared light .",
    "therefore , our result should be compared with observational estimates of temperature derived under the same assumptions of @xmath110 and low opacity to fir light . keeping this point in mind ,",
    "known high-@xmath3 luminous starburst galaxies seem to have a mean temperature of about 50k , under the above conditions for @xmath57 and infrared opacity , and some of them show a high temperature of @xmath111k ( ivison et al .",
    "1998a , b ; benford et al .",
    "recently a comprehensive study for the sed of local ulirgs is published ( klaas et al .",
    "2001 ) , and it again shows that the ulirg dust temperature ranges from @xmath10240 to @xmath10280k , with @xmath112 and @xmath113 0.55 . these observations then indicate that the temperature derived by our model for primordial elliptical galaxies is in a reasonable range of typical known starburst galaxies , although it is much higher than the simple extrapolation of the mean @xmath1-@xmath0 relation of local galaxies .      figure  [ fig : nc - std ] shows predictions of infrared galaxy counts compared with available data at 15 , 60 , 90 , 170 , 450 , and 850 @xmath2 m wavebands by our baseline model .",
    "in the baseline model , we assumed a @xmath52-dominated flat cosmology with @xmath114 = ( 0.7 , 0.2 , 0.8 ) , formation redshift of @xmath115 for all galaxy types , pure luminosity evolution without number evolution , and screen dust model . see figure caption for the references of observed data .",
    "the parameter of overall normalization of dust optical depth , @xmath39 is determined here so that the count predictions fit best the brightest _ iras _  counts at 15 , 60 , and 90 @xmath2 m bands .",
    "this normalization has already been used in the previous sections . our model predicts lower and higher counts than the bright counts observed in 15 and 60 @xmath2 m , respectively , and it may suggest that our modeling of infrared sed might be imperfect , but it might also reflect some systematic uncertainties in the calibration of the observed flux in these wavebands ( see e.g. , mazzei et al .  2001 ; lari et al . 2001 ; serjeant et al .",
    "this figure shows contributions from each galaxy type as well as the total counts .",
    "nearby spiral galaxies are dominant in the brightest counts , while contribution from elliptical galaxies rapidly appears when the flux is decreased down to a certain value , because of the strong dusty starburst of these galaxies at their formation stage .",
    "appearance of high-@xmath3 starburst galaxies revealed by scuba in submillimeter wavelengths is in good agreement with count predictions of forming elliptical galaxies at @xmath116 in our model , and hence it can be interpreted as the emergence of forming elliptical galaxies .",
    "the redshift of @xmath116 for these galaxies is also consistent with redshift estimates of scuba sources ( e.g. , dunlop 2001 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our model suggests that relatively weak evolution in the 15@xmath2m - band counts at @xmath117jy is not due to elliptical galaxies , but induced by evolution of spiral galaxies .",
    "strong evolution suggested by _ iso _  observations ( e.g. , efstathiou et al .",
    "2000 ; matsuhara et al .",
    "2000 ) in the 90@xmath2 m band may not be explained by the emergence of elliptical galaxies in our model .",
    "however , contribution from such galaxies with smaller @xmath16 , or bulges of spiral galaxies , could explain the observed evolution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nc - zf ] below ) .",
    "( it should be noted that the bulge and disk of spiral galaxies are modeled as a mixture in our model . )",
    "figures  [ fig : nc - cosm ] , [ fig : nc - zf ] , and [ fig : nc - num ] show the count prediction for the total of all galaxy types in cases of different cosmological models , formation redshifts , and number evolutions , respectively .",
    "the dependence on cosmological models becomes important at flux much fainter than the present sensitivity limits , except for 15@xmath2 m .",
    "therefore the uncertainty in cosmological parameters does not affect our conclusions significantly .",
    "although there may be some uncertainties in our modeling of number evolution , it seems that the counts of scuba sources in submillimeter bands are better explained by primordial elliptical galaxies without number evolution , rather than the cases of number evolution .",
    "this may indicate that elliptical galaxies have formed by a single starburst at high redshifts , rather than by many starbursts of smaller building blocks which would eventually merge into a giant elliptical galaxy after the starbursts .",
    "this is consistent with a number of literature about observational constraints on number evolution of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , totani & yoshii 1998 ; i m et al .",
    "1999 ; schade et al .",

    "it was also found that the surface number density of such hyper - extremely red objects ( heros ) is roughly the same with that of high-@xmath3 starbursts discovered by scuba in sub - mm bands . in the count model of this paper , a significant part of the scuba sources",
    "can be explained by the forming elliptical galaxies , and hence our result here quantitatively strengthens the suggestion of totani et al .",
    "( 2001b ) that the scuba sources and heros have the same origin of forming primordial elliptical galaxies in the dusty starburst phase .",
    "figure [ fig : csfh ] shows the cosmic history of global star formation rate as a function of redshift , for our model as well as observational estimates coming from h@xmath129 , uv , and submillimeter luminosity density evolution .",
    "the elliptical galaxies in our model have a strong peak of sfr at their formation redshift , while the formation redshift should be distributed in some redshift range in reality . therefore we plot the mean sfr for elliptical galaxies when they are assumed to be formed before @xmath3 = 2 or 3 , as indicated by horizontal lines .",
    "elliptical galaxies in our model have much higher global sfr at @xmath130 than the peak at @xmath5 suggested by the optical observations ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; connolly et al .",
    "1997 ; madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ; steidel et al . 1999 ; cowie , songaila , & barger 1999 ; thompson et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the model is still consistent with the fir background detected by _ cobe_/firas .",
    "this is in very sharp contrast to a number of previous studies ( e.g. , gispert , lagache , & puget 2000 ; takeuchi et al .",
    "2001a ; franceschini et al .",
    "2001 ) which claimed that such high sfr beyond @xmath131 is disfavored from the _ cobe_/firas data .",
    "this is because the dust temperature of forming elliptical galaxies is much higher than expected from the local @xmath1-@xmath0 relation , as explained in ",
    "[ section : cbr ] .",
    "the sfr expected from elliptical galaxies is close to those inferred from galaxies detected in submillimeter observations ( hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; barger , cowie , & richards 2000 ) , and this again suggests that a considerable part of forming elliptical galaxies has been detected by submillimeter observations .",
    "[ note , however , that the higher points of barger et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are corrected by a factor of @xmath102 11 for incompleteness . ] on the other hand , sfr expected from spiral galaxies is in reasonable agreement with those obtained by optical ( i.e. , uv in the restframe ) observations .",
    "therefore a natural interpretation of these results is that the cosmic star formation history inferred from uv light is that for steady or modest star formation in disks of spiral galaxies , while starbursts in elliptical or spheroidal components of galaxies emit their energy mostly in the form of dust emission observed in submillimeter wavelengths .      the key of our success to reproduce the scaling properties of local infrared galaxies (",
    "i.e. , optical / infrared luminosity ratio , @xmath1-@xmath0 relation , and infrared luminosity function ) is the relation between the optical luminosity and size of galaxies , which is used as an input in our model .",
    "therefore the readers may wonder what is the origin of this relation .",
    "in fact , this scaling relation can be explained by the framework of the standard structure formation theory in the cdm universe .",
    "one can predict the virial size of cosmological objects when the mass and formation redshift are specified .",
    "then the observed scaling relation between @xmath19 and @xmath18 is easily reproduced when some reasonable assumptions are made such as a roughly constant mass - to - luminosity ratio , proportionality between the virial radius and disk effective radius ( equivalent to the constant angular momentum ) , and formation of disks at @xmath132 ( e.g. , mao & mo 1998 ) .",
    "the scatter along the mean relation can also be reproduced by the dispersion of angular momentum of dark haloes .",
    "this means that the local scaling relations of infrared galaxies also have their origin in the structure formation in the cdm universe .",
    "this also explains the success of a semi - analytic model of granato et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to reproduce the local infrared properties .",
    "tev gamma - ray observations provide a unique constraint on cbr because very high energy gamma - rays beyond @xmath102tev are absorbed by interaction with the infrared cbr photons to produce electron - positron pairs in intergalactic field ( e.g. , gould & schrder 1967 ; stecker & de jager 1997 , 1998 ; salamon & stecker 1998 ; primack et al .",
    "gamma - rays with energy @xmath133 mainly interact with infrared photons with wavelength @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the planck constant and @xmath136/tev .",
    "therefore detections of gamma - rays at @xmath102 10tev for tev blazars",
    "mrk 421 ( @xmath137 and mrk 501 @xmath138 ) ( krennrich , et al .  1999 ;",
    "aharonian et al .",
    "1999 ) give constraints on the mir cbr at about 1020 @xmath2 m .",
    "the thick crosses plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebl - std ] are taken from biller et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and renault et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and our baseline model is consistent with this limit .",
    "the cbr flux at 15@xmath2 m in our baseline model is 2.5nw / m@xmath139/sr , and the lower bound set by the count integration in this band accounts for about 80  % of the total cbr of the model .",
    "it should be noted that the model using the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relation predicts higher mir cbr flux , while the fir peak is lower than the baseline model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ebl - alt ] ) .",
    "this difference originates from the dependence of mir / fir flux ratio of the model infrared seds on the dust temperature . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed - schem ] , mir / fir flux ratio decreases with increasing dust temperature , due to the diminishing component of small grain dust and pah features .",
    "this trend is physically reasonable as explained in ",
    "[ section : sed ] .",
    "the difference of our baseline model and that using the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relation is that the dust temperature of starbursting elliptical galaxies in the former is much higher than in the latter .",
    "therefore , in the baseline model , the strong thermal dust emission from forming elliptical galaxies has a largest contribution to the peak of fir cbr , while it hardly contributes to the mir cbr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ebl - std ] ) .",
    "this is why we could reproduce simultaneously the high fir peak and low mir cbr flux which are fully consistent with observations of _ cobe _  and tev gamma - rays .    on the other hand ,",
    "the dust temperature does not become as high as our baseline model in models employing the empirical @xmath140-@xmath0 relation , and hence mir / fir flux ratio of cbr is not low enough to match both tev limits in mir and the _ cobe _  data in fir .",
    "this _ prima facie _ conflict has been noticed in previous work based on the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relations of local infrared galaxies ( e.g. , stecker 2000 ) , and several possibilities have been proposed to solve this conflict , including new physics such as a possibility of the broken lorentz invariance .",
    "however , our model suggests that the mir and fir cbr are made by completely different populations of galaxies : low - redshift spiral galaxies for mir while high - redshift starbursting elliptical galaxies for fir , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebl - std ] .",
    "thus in our model the conflict is naturally resolved .",
    "we calculated the optical depth of tev gamma - rays as a function of source redshift ( @xmath141 ) and gamma - ray energy observed at @xmath37 , based on the formulations given in salamon & stecker ( 1998 ) . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] , along with the previous calculations of stecker & de jager ( 1998 , hereafter sd98 ) based on the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relation .",
    "the baseline model is used for the flux and its evolution of the cbr from optical to fir .",
    "as expected , the optical depth of our model ( indicated as ttttt in the figure from the initials of the authors ) is relatively smaller at gamma - ray energies of @xmath102 110 tev where the main target photons are in the mir band , while it becomes larger for higher energy gamma - rays interacting with fir photons , when compared with the sd98 calculation .",
    "the different two models might be discriminated by more accurate measurement of the tev spectrum of mrk 421 and/or 501 in future observations .",
    "following sd98 , we give the result of polynomial fits to the optical depth @xmath142 , as @xmath143 where the values of @xmath144 are presented in table [ table : tevopt ] .",
    "this fitting formula gives a reasonable approximation ( @xmath145 10% at @xmath146 and @xmath147 , and @xmath50 50% within ranges of @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) .",
    "more accurate table of the optical depth with wider ranges of @xmath141 and @xmath133 is available on request to the authors .",
    "in this paper we developed a new model of counts and cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) of infrared galaxies observed by emission from heated interstellar dust , by extending a model for optical / nir galaxies ( totani & yoshii 2000 ) .",
    "five morphological types of galaxies ( e / s0 , sab , sbc , scd , and sdm ) are taken into account and their number densities are normalized by type - dependent @xmath15-band luminosity function at the local universe .",
    "their luminosity evolution is traced backwards in time based on star formation histories inferred from the present - day optical / nir seds and chemical properties .",
    "formation epoch of galaxies is a parameter for which we tried a redshift range of @xmath150 .",
    "pure luminosity evolution without number evolution is assumed in our baseline model , but some number evolution is also tested in a phenomenological way . the model has already been compared comprehensively with the counts and redshift distributions of galaxies observed in optical and nir bands , and found to be in reasonable agreement with the data ( totani & yoshii 2000 ; totani et al .",
    "2001c ) .",
    "relatively rare populations of agns and ulirgs seen in the local universe , whose contribution to counts and cbr is expected to be small , are not included in our model , and we tried to explain the bulk of infrared data by normal galaxy populations at the local universe and their ancestors at high redshifts . on the other hand , our analysis strongly indicates that the primordial elliptical galaxies are very similar to dusty starburst galaxies or ulirgs with very high dust temperature .",
    "there are two important new characteristics in our model that are different from previous models of infrared galaxies : ( 1 ) mass scale dependence of dust extinction is introduced by the observed size - luminosity relation of optical galaxies , and ( 2 ) dust temperature is determined by physical consideration of energy balance , rather than using the empirical relation between the total infrared luminosity ( @xmath1 ) and characteristic dust temperature ( @xmath0 ) of local galaxies that has been used in a number of previous models . as a result , the local properties of infrared galaxies , such as optical / infrared luminosity ratios , correlation between infrared luminosity and dust temperature , and infrared luminosity function , are outputs that should be compared with observed data .",
    "indeed we found that our model quantitatively reproduces the observed infrared properties at the local universe .",
    "the key to understand these scaling properties is the size - luminosity relation of galaxies ; surface brightness and dust column density increase with increasing optical galaxy luminosity , and hence more massive galaxies should be more dusty .",
    "this gives a quantitative explanation for the observed correlation between optical and infrared luminosities .",
    "furthermore , massive galaxies should emit more energy as dust emission per unit mass of dust , and hence the energy balance inevitably results in higher temperature for larger galaxies , as observed for local infrared galaxies .",
    "the scatter along the mean @xmath151-@xmath18 relation is comparable with those in @xmath1-@xmath151 and @xmath1-@xmath0 relations .",
    "these effects result in much faster increase of 60@xmath2 m luminosity when @xmath19 is increased , and giving an explanation for the much broader shape of 60@xmath2 m luminosity function than the schechter function of the optical luminosity function .",
    "then we predicted faint source counts and cbr composed of high-@xmath3 galaxies .",
    "our baseline model assumes a cosmological model with ( @xmath152 ) = ( 0.7 , 0.2 , 0.8 ) , pure luminosity evolution after formation at @xmath115 , and screen distribution of dust .",
    "we found that this baseline model is in reasonable agreement with all available data of galaxy counts in six wavebands ( 15 , 60 , 90 , 170 , 450 , and 850@xmath2 m ) and cbr .",
    "therefore our model , based only on present - day normal galaxy populations and their evolution , reasonably fits to all available data from optical to submillimeter wavebands , though some modest number evolution may be required for late - type galaxies .",
    "the high-@xmath3 starburst galaxies discovered by scuba are quantitatively well explained in our model by the emergence of starbursts at the formation of present - day elliptical galaxies at @xmath116 .",
    "we also tested that slab - type dust distribution as well as the screen dust used in the baseline model , and found that the screen model gives much better fit to the observed data of the local infrared luminosity function , galaxy counts , and cbr .",
    "although a pure screen distribution may seem unlikely , it is rather reasonable to expect that a part of dust particles behave like an effective screen , because of stellar / galactic wind or inhomogeneity of interstellar medium .",
    "if it is the case , and the dust opacity to optical / nir is much larger than the unity , the screen model should be better than the slab - type prescription .",
    "it is also supported by extremely red colors of local starburst galaxies ( calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann 1994 ) or recently discovered hyper extremely red objects ( totani et al .",
    "2001b ) , which can not be explained simply by slab - type dust .",
    "therefore we conclude that screen dust is a better phenomenological description than slab dust at least in a study of this kind .",
    "the most drastic difference of our model from previous ones is that the dust temperature of starbursting elliptical galaxies is predicted to be much higher ( @xmath102 4080k ) than that extrapolated by the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relation of local infrared galaxies .",
    "this is because starbursting elliptical galaxies should emit much larger amount of energy as dust emission _ per unit dust mass _ , than local galaxy populations . on the other hand ,",
    "such high temperature is similar to those found in local ulirgs or high-@xmath3 dust starbursts observed in sub - mm bands .",
    "thus , our result gives a further support to an idea that the progenitor of present - day elliptical galaxies or bulges are dusty starbursts .",
    "there is an important implication for the cosmic star formation history , which is very different from previous results .",
    "a number of papers based on the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relation claimed that cosmic star formation rate beyond @xmath153 1 must turn over and keep constant or decline , otherwise it would produce too much submillimeter cbr compared with the _ cobe_/firas data , by the redshifted dust emission from high-@xmath3 galaxies ( e.g. , gispert , lagache , & puget 2000 ; takeuchi et al .",
    "2001a ; franceschini et al .",
    "however , in our model the dust temperature of forming elliptical galaxies is much higher than in the previous models . as a result , although our model assumes very strong starbursts at @xmath154 3 in primordial elliptical galaxies and the cosmic sfr at @xmath127 23 is even higher than the peak at @xmath155 1 suggested by optical observations , the prediction is in good agreement not only with the _ cobe_/firas cbr measurements but also with the counts and redshift estimation for submillimeter sources revealed by scuba . in our model",
    "the dusty starbursts in primordial elliptical galaxies hardly contribute to the cosmic sfr measured by optical observations .",
    "another result that is significantly different from previous studies is the smaller ratio of mir / fir cbr flux compared with models based on the empirical @xmath1-@xmath0 relation of local infrared galaxies ( e.g. , stecker 2000 ) .",
    "it should be noted that our model does include the warm / nonequilibrium components of dust emission that dominate the thermal emission from big grain dust at the mir region , while several previous models gave very low mir cbr flux as a valley in the cbr spectrum simply because they did not take them into account ( e.g. , macminn & primack 1996 ; fall , charlot , & pei 1996 ) .",
    "the reason we get this result is the trend that the warm / nonequilibrium components become less significant compared with thermal big - grain dust emission , with increasing temperature of dust .",
    "this is inferred from the infrared spectrum of local galaxies , and it is also expected from physical consideration . if this trend is taken for granted for high-@xmath3 galaxies , the mir / fir flux ratio of dust emission from forming elliptical galaxies should be much smaller than that of local infrared galaxies , since the dust temperature of starbursting elliptical galaxies is found to be very high in our model .",
    "therefore these galaxies dominate in the fir peak of cbr while they have very small contribution in mir cbr .",
    "this effect is significant enough to resolve the _ prima facie _ conflict ( stecker 2000 ) between the upper limits on mir cbr from tev gamma - ray observations and fir cbr detections by _ cobe_/dirbe and firas .",
