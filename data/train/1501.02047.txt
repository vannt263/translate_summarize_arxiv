    "galaxies form at high density peaks of statistical density fluctuations in the universe .",
    "they are thus statistical objects in nature , and a large survey of the sky is the key observation to measure their physical properties .",
    "this has motivated recent surveys such as sloan digital sky survey @xcite , ukirt deep infrared sky survey @xcite , canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey , and many others .",
    "following them , there are a number of on - going / planned surveys , including the hyper suprime - cam survey ( miyazaki et al . in prep . ) , vst and vista public surveys , the dark energy survey @xcite , euclid , wfirst @xcite , and large synoptic survey telescope @xcite .",
    "these surveys are going to observe a large fraction of the sky down to unprecedented depths in order to address some of the outstanding astrophysical questions today , such as the nature of dark energy , with a superb statistical accuracy .",
    "most of these large surveys are imaging surveys .",
    "the information we can obtain directly from imaging data is unfortunately very limited ; positions , apparent fluxes , apparent sizes , and shapes in a given set of filters , and their time variability if multi - epoch data are available . in order to study the nature of distant objects",
    ", we need to translate these apparent quantities into physical quantities such as luminosities and physical sizes .",
    "distance information is required for this job . also , weak - lensing cosmology , which is one of the major science goals of the large surveys , requires redshifts ( or at least a mean redshift ) of source galaxies .",
    "a precise redshift can be measured from a spectroscopic observation .",
    "it is , however , practically not possible to measure precise redshifts even for 1% of objects from these surveys with any of the existing / near - future facilities .",
    "furthermore , most of the objects will be fainter than the spectroscopic sensitivity limits .",
    "there are currently two techniques to overcome these problems : photometric redshift and clustering redshift .",
    "photometric redshift is a technique to infer redshifts of objects from photometry in a set of filters , first demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "thanks to the progress in numerical techniques , it now has two branches : spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting and machine - learning .",
    "the first branch is the traditional technique and it relies on a priori knowledge of seds of galaxies .",
    "extensive discussions on the technique can be found in @xcite .",
    "our new code presented here falls in this category and we will elaborate on the ( dis)advantages of the sed fitting later .",
    "a number of photo-@xmath0 codes have been published and the most popular ones would include bpz @xcite , zebra @xcite , lephare @xcite , and eazy @xcite .",
    "the second branch is purely numerical ( i.e. , no physics ) and the idea is to relate observables such as colors to redshifts in one way or another using a training set , which has to represent an input photometric sample .",
    "a number of numerical techniques have been applied such as polynomial fitting @xcite , artificial neural network @xcite and prediction trees @xcite .",
    "extensive comparisons between some of these public sed - based / machine - learning photo-@xmath0 codes have been carried out by @xcite .",
    "clustering redshift utilizes the positional information , not flux information , of objects .",
    "the idea is simple  cross - correlation between two galaxy samples yields a signal where they overlap in redshift and the clustering signal can thus be used as a redshift inference .",
    "several authors have explored this technique with slightly different objectives ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one powerful application of this technique is to use a sample of spectroscopic redshifts , in which the redshift distribution is precisely known , as a reference .",
    "if one makes a narrow redshift bin with a spectroscopic sample and cross - correlate it with a photometric sample , the clustering signal is proportional to the number of photometric galaxies in that redshift bin . by shifting the spectroscopic redshift bin , one can in principle reconstruct a redshift distribution of the input photometric sample ( see @xcite for application of this technique for a few specific cases ) .",
    "however , there is one uncertainty here ; the clustering signal is also proportional to the bias of the photometric sample , which is not straightforward to measure a priori @xcite .",
    "this can be a serious issue when the photometric sample covers a wide range of redshift or has multiple peaks in the redshift distribution , which may often be the case in real analysis .",
    "there are pros and cons in these techniques and one should choose one that is best suited for his / her science application .",
    "we focus on the traditional sed fitting technique in this paper for two reasons : ( 1 ) machine - learning techniques require a representative training sample , which in practice means they do not go fainter than the spectroscopic limits and ( 2 ) the clustering technique does not give redshifts of individual galaxies ( it gives @xmath1 of the input photometric sample ) . for each grid .",
    "but , it will require a huge number of spectroscopic redshifts and is unlikely a practical method at this point .",
    "it will not work for rare objects either . ]",
    "the 1st point is a serious limitation of the machine - learning techniques because objects that we are concerned about are often fainter than the spectroscopic limit .",
    "one can of course extrapolate to faint magnitudes , but an extrapolation always requires a great care . with the sed fitting technique , we can expect to go fainter than the spectroscopic limit provided that our understanding of seds of galaxies is reasonable .",
    "the 2nd point is also important because , if one can not infer redshifts of individual galaxies , one can not estimate their physical properties , making galaxy science difficult .",
    "the sed fitting technique has its own problem ; it relies on our a priori knowledge of seds of galaxies .",
    "observed seds of galaxies are often used as templates , but these templates are almost exclusively collected at @xmath2 .",
    "the multi - color space at high redshifts may not be fully covered by those templates because high redshift galaxies are younger than galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "one can instead use a stellar population synthesis ( sps ) code to remedy the issue with its flexibility to generate seds of a given age .",
    "however , sps models do not perfectly reproduce observed colors of galaxies due to systematics in the models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . furthermore , it is easy to generate models that are physically unreasonable such as a template with zero sfr with a large amount of extinction .",
    "such templates increase the degeneracy in the multi - color space , resulting in poor photo-@xmath0 accuracies .    in this paper",
    ", we choose to use sps models with a novel approach to overcome these problems ; ( a ) we apply bayesian priors on physical properties of galaxies to constrain the parameter space of sps models within realistic ranges as a function of redshift and ( b ) correct for systematic flux errors using template error functions ( which are an extended version of template error functions often adopted in the literature ) .",
    "this technique is still in its early phase of development and the paper presents a proof - of - concept analysis of the physical priors and template error functions .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "we give a brief overview of the paper in section 2 , followed by a description of how we generate model templates in section 3 .",
    "section 4 presents the framework of our technique and describes the physical priors in detail .",
    "we define a template error function in section 5 and then move on to demonstrate how these priors and template error functions improve photo-@xmath0 s in section 6 .",
    "we compare our code with bpz used for cfhtlens in section 7 .",
    "section 8 aims to characterize biases in inferred physical properties of galaxies introduced by the priors and template error functions .",
    "finally , we discuss future directions in section 9 and summarize the paper in section 10 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we adopt a flat universe with @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "as one of the major goals of upcoming / on - going surveys is weak - lensing cosmology , it is important to emphasize that our photo-@xmath0 s are not dependent on a specific choice of cosmology .",
    "we simply need to assume a popular cosmology often adopted in the literature in order to use the observed relationships between galaxy properties as priors ( see section 4 for details ) .",
    "first of all , we give a brief overview of our technique in this section .",
    "thanks to the enormous amount of work on galaxy populations over a wide range of redshift , we now have a reasonable understanding of galaxy properties across cosmic times .",
    "we apply bayesian priors based on our knowledge of galaxy properties to sps models , in which physical properties such as stellar mass are known , to constrain the model parameters within realistic ranges .",
    "we let the priors evolve with redshift in order to account for evolutionary effects . a fixed set of templates",
    "are often used in photo-@xmath0 estimates , but the priors effectively evolve the templates in an observationally motivated manner .",
    "our approach here is suited for upcoming / on - going large imaging surveys such as hsc , des and lsst , which image the sky only in a limited number of filters in the optical wavelengths .",
    "if one has photometry in a large number of filters spanning a wide wavelength range with sufficient s / n , which may often be the case in deep fields , one does not necessarily have to apply priors because there is enough information in the data to constrain the overall spectral shape of objects .",
    "in fact , @xcite did not apply any priors because they had 30-band photometry .",
    "however , with the limited photometric information in the large surveys , it is difficult to break some of the degeneracies in the multi - color space , resulting in poor photo-@xmath0 accuracies",
    ". we demonstrate below that the priors developed here are particularly useful to break ( or least weaken ) the degeneracies in such situations and they significantly improve photo-@xmath0 s .",
    "in addition to the physical priors , we introduce a template error function , which comes in two terms ; systematic flux stretch and flux uncertainty as a function of rest - frame wavelength .",
    "the first term is to reduce mismatches between sps seds and observed seds and the 2nd term assigns uncertainties to the model templates to properly weight reliable parts of templates .",
    "the template error function is not a new idea and has been used by eazy @xcite and fast @xcite .",
    "but , they include only the 2nd term .",
    "we introduce the 1st term in order to reduce systematic offsets in @xmath6 and improve the overall photo-@xmath0 accuracy as we demonstrate in section 6 .",
    "one of the strengths of our code is that it infers , in addition to redshifts , physical properties of galaxies in a self - consistent manner .",
    "a popular procedure to infer the physical properties is to first estimate photo-@xmath0 s with empirical or pca templates , and then change templates to sps models to infer physical properties .",
    "sps models are usually not used to infer photo-@xmath0 s because they deliver poor accuracy .",
    "but , as we demonstrate in section 6 , the physical priors and template error functions improve sps - based photo-@xmath0 s and we do not need take this 2-step approach anymore .",
    "we can infer both redshifts and physical properties simultaneously using the same set of templates .",
    "this is important because redshift and sed shapes are partially degenerate and thus they have to be measured in a self - consistent manner . with our technique",
    ", we can properly propagate uncertainties in redshift into uncertainties in physical properties .",
    "our code is called mizuki .",
    "a preliminary version of the code was used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper gives a full description of the code as it stands today .",
    "it is still in an early phase of development and one of the aims of the paper is to identify areas where further work is needed .",
    "we focus on galaxies in this paper , but our goal is to compute relative probabilities that an object is star , agn / qso , or galaxy with corresponding @xmath7 for each class for star is simply @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the dirac delta function . ] .",
    "tests on agns and stars are being carried out and we defer detailed discussions to our future paper .",
    "we use spectral templates of galaxies generated with the @xcite code . to the first order ,",
    "a specific choice of sps code is not a major concern because a template error function described in section 5 will reduce systematic differences between the model and observed seds of galaxies .",
    "in fact , we have confirmed that an updated version of the code , which incorporates a revised treatment of thermally pulsating agb stars , deliver similar photo - z accuracies .",
    "we choose to use the older version because there is a growing body of evidence for thermally pulsating agb stars being unimportant in integrated optical - nearir spectra of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although these stars may be hidden by dust and may be an important contributor to thermal emission in the ir .",
    "one needs to make several assumptions to generate seds with an sps code .",
    "these assumptions include , initial mass function ( imf ) , attenuation curve , star formation history , and metallicity distribution .",
    "the first two are often assumed to be time - invariant .",
    "none of them is known a priori for a given galaxy , and the assumptions employed inevitably introduce systematic uncertainties in the physical parameters such as stellar mass inferred from sed fitting .",
    "we choose to employ popular assumptions often adopted in the literature so that we can use the published results on galaxy properties as priors ( see the next section for details ) . to be specific , we assume the chabrier imf @xcite , calzetti attenuation curve @xcite , exponentially decaying star formation rates ( i.e. , @xmath10-model ) , and solar metallicity .",
    "@xcite models do not include nebular emission lines and so we add them using the intensity ratios in @xcite with the @xcite differential attenuation law .",
    "the lyman @xmath11 escape fraction is assumed to be 10% at all redshifts .",
    "thermal dust emission is yet to be included in the models , but it does not affect results presented in this paper .",
    "absorption due to the lyman alpha forest is applied following @xcite .",
    "let us briefly discuss the validity of some of these assumptions .",
    "a realistic spectral model should consider a metallicity distribution , but we assume that all the stars have solar metallicity as often assumed in the literature .",
    "@xcite showed that broad - band evolution of multi - metallicity galaxy seds is equivalent to that of single mean metallicity population in the redward of the @xmath12-band .",
    "we should keep in mind that we suffer from multi - metallicity effects , in addition to the evolutionary effects , at high redshifts where we often observe rest - frame uv of galaxies .",
    "the biggest uncertainty in our models is perhaps star formation histories .",
    "it is a fundamentally difficult problem to reconstruct star formation histories from broad - band photometry due to the fact that a small amount of recent star formation can dominate the overall sed , hiding light from old stellar populations @xcite .",
    "the only way to solve the problem might be to resolve galaxies into individual stars , but that is not a practical solution for galaxies at cosmological distances . given this fundamental difficulty , we prefer to be simple and take the popular assumption of @xmath10-models .",
    "we generate sps templates for ages between 0.05 and 14 gyr with a logarithmic grid of @xmath13  dex . for @xmath10 , in addition to the single stellar population model ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) and constant sfr model ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) , we assume @xmath16 with a logarithmic grid of @xmath17  dex . optical depth in the @xmath12-band goes between 0 and 2 with a step of 0.1 with an addition of @xmath18 and 5 models to cover very dusty sources .",
    "these templates are then redshifted to @xmath19 with @xmath20 and are convolved with response functions of a given instrument to generate a library of synthetic fluxes .",
    "a synthetic broad - band flux is computed as    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the response function of an instrument ( which includes the atmospheric transmission for ground - based facilities ) , and @xmath23 is the input spectrum . in total",
    ", we have about 2 million templates .",
    "we now describe the physical priors .",
    "we begin with the bayesian framework and then move on to describe each of the physical priors .",
    "we follow the bayesian framework to constrain the parameter space of the sps models .",
    "let @xmath24 be an array of input photometric information in a given set of filters .",
    "we aim to infer photometric redshift ( @xmath25 ) from @xmath24 .",
    "physical properties of an input sps model can be specified by      where parameters on the right are metallicity , optical depth in the @xmath12-band ( i.e. , amount of attenuation ) , @xmath27-folding time scale of star formation rate , and age of the model . at this point ,",
    "a model is normalized such that initial sfr is 1 @xmath28 .",
    "let us introduce a normalization factor , @xmath11 , in order to be able to compute stellar mass and sfr , which scale linearly with the normalization .",
    "stellar mass and sfr are important because they can be measured more precisely in observations than the other parameters and we will extensively use them in what follows .",
    "a posterior probability of finding @xmath0 and @xmath29 from a given @xmath24 is      the prior on redshift and physical properties of galaxies , @xmath31 , needs some consideration .",
    "ideally , we would like to apply the prior @xmath32 on all the parameters simultaneously , but we do not have sufficient observational constraints on the distributions of the physical parameters and their redshift dependence .",
    "observationally available constraints are often correlations between some limited combinations of the parameters .",
    "one instead could use semi - analytic models to construct @xmath32 , but semi - analytic models do not perfectly reproduce galaxy properties in the real universe and the priors may well be biased .    what this prior effectively does is to constrain the physical parameters of the sps models within realistic ranges .",
    "this motivates us to interpret the prior broadly and consider constraining the parameter space by combining observed relationships between physical properties of galaxies available in the literature ( which are basically in form of marginalized probability distribution functions ) .",
    "we assume that the prior can be factorized by      this set of priors is not fully equivalent to @xmath32 , but we are limited by the available observational information on these physical parameters . as mentioned above ,",
    "metallicity is fixed to solar .",
    "but , thanks to the strong dust - age - metallicity degeneracy , the multi - color space is covered by the dust and age variations .",
    "metallicity is difficult to infer from broad - band photometry ( e.g. , @xcite ) and it is unlikely a useful prior in any case .",
    "because of the experimental aspect of the priors , we regard the analysis in this paper as a proof - of - concept analysis rather than fully contained work of physical priors .",
    "we plan to further test and explore physical priors in the future .          where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are observed and model fluxes in the @xmath39-th filter and @xmath40 is the observed flux uncertainty in that filter .",
    "we note that we use linear fluxes in the above equations , not logarithmic magnitudes .",
    "we will later introduce a template error function , which assigns uncertainties to model fluxes .",
    "the above equations can be easily extended to add the model uncertainties to the observed flux uncertainties in the quadrature .",
    "using eqs . 4 - 6 , we can now work out eq .",
    "3 . however , the marginalization over @xmath11 turns out to be a computationally expensive task .",
    "we find that , in our cases discussed in the following sections , @xmath34 is sharply peaked around @xmath11 that minimizes @xmath41 defined in eq .",
    "6 , which can be computed by          motivated by the sharp probability distribution function ( pdf ) around @xmath44 , we have compared photo-@xmath0 s computed with the marginalization over @xmath11 and those computed with @xmath45 without marginalization .",
    "it turns out that they are almost identical : @xmath46 with no systematic offset between the two runs .",
    "this level of scatter is much smaller than those we discuss later and it does not affect our results at all . very faint objects ( e.g. , those with photometric uncertainties larger than 0.5 mag in all filters ) may have a significant @xmath34 over a wide range of @xmath11 , but photo-@xmath0 uncertainties for such faint objects are large in any case and the extra uncertainty coming from assuming @xmath45 will be negligible . for these reasons , we assume          our choice of the model grids are described in the previous section .",
    "a pdf is then normalized such that the probability integrated over redshift equals unity . in a similar way , we can compute pdfs for physical properties ( using @xmath44 for sfr and stellar mass ) with all the other parameters marginalized over .",
    "we shall emphasize that redshift is also marginalized over and the uncertainty in redshift is properly included in pdfs of physical properties .",
    "these pdfs will be very useful for galaxy studies .    in the following ,",
    "we first define the @xmath49 prior and then move on to describe the physical priors used to constrain the parameter space of the sps models .",
    "one may rightly worry that the physical priors bias the inferred physical properties .",
    "we will quantify biases introduced by the priors in section 8 and show that they are small .",
    "a redshift distribution of galaxies , @xmath49 , is often used as a prior for photo-@xmath0 s in the literature and is probably the most popular one ( it is denoted as @xmath7 in eq .",
    "this prior is essentially an apparent , observed - frame luminosity function of galaxies times unit volume integrated over redshift .",
    "we could use a more physically oriented prior such as rest - frame luminosity function or stellar mass function .",
    "after some experiments , it turned out that the @xmath49 prior give similar improvements to luminosity and stellar mass function priors . because @xmath49 is expected to introduce less bias in the inferred physical properties of galaxies , we choose to use @xmath49 .    constraining @xmath49 is not a trivial task because it requires unbiased redshifts of a large number of objects down to faint enough magnitudes that we are interested in .",
    "one of the ways would be to use semi - analytic models as done by @xcite , although semi - analytic models may not perfectly reproduce the @xmath49 in the real universe @xcite .",
    "we here take an empirical approach and use very accurate photo-@xmath0 estimates from @xcite to construct @xmath49 .",
    "we note that @xcite did not apply any @xmath49 prior .",
    "there are a number of functional forms of @xmath49 adopted in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , @xmath49 shows a high redshift tail at faint magnitudes .",
    "we slightly tweak the functional forms adopted by these authors and take the form of      where @xmath51 , @xmath11 , and @xmath52 are free parameters .",
    "this form has fewer free parameters than those adopted in @xcite and @xcite , but the high redshift tail is described well by the 2nd exponent .",
    "we also introduce a softening parameter suggested by @xcite to avoid too small probabilities at low redshifts , which can be problematic for bright objects .",
    "this prior can be extended to include magnitude dependence , @xmath53 , as done by @xcite .",
    "we fit the functional form in eq .",
    "[ eq : nz ] to the photo-@xmath0 catalog from @xcite in a number of @xmath39-band magnitude bins .",
    "a sample fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndz_prior ] and the fitted parameters are summarized in table [ tab : nz_param ] .",
    "we note that one of the most popular codes bpz applies a template - dependent @xmath49 prior prior constrains relative fractions of galaxy populations ( e.g. , quiescent vs. star forming ) as a function of redshift .",
    "therefore , a care is needed when it is used for galaxy population studies .",
    "] , but we assume that this prior is independent of templates .",

    "<S> we present a proof - of - concept analysis of photometric redshifts with bayesian priors on physical properties of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this concept is particularly suited for upcoming / on - going large imaging surveys , in which only several broad - band filters are available and it is hard to break some of the degeneracies in the multi - color space . </S>",
    "<S> we construct model templates of galaxies using a stellar population synthesis code and apply bayesian priors on physical properties such as stellar mass and star formation rate . </S>",
    "<S> these priors are a function of redshift and they effectively evolve the templates with time in an observationally motivated way . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the priors help reduce the degeneracy and deliver significantly improved photometric redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that a template error function , which corrects for systematic flux errors in the model templates as a function of rest - frame wavelength , delivers further improvements . one great advantage of our technique is that we simultaneously measure redshifts and physical properties of galaxies in a fully self - consistent manner , unlike the two - step measurements with different templates often performed in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> one may rightly worry that the physical priors bias the inferred galaxy properties , but we show that the bias is smaller than systematic uncertainties inherent in physical properties inferred from the sed fitting and hence is not a major issue . </S>",
    "<S> we will extensively test and tune the priors in the on - going hyper suprime - cam survey and will make the code publicly available in the future . </S>"
