    "searches for extrasolar planets by using microlensing are being carried out by observing stars located toward the galactic bulge field .",
    "the lensing signal of a planet is a short - duration perturbation to the smooth standard light curve of the primary - induced lensing event occurring on a background star @xcite . for the detections of the short - duration planetary lensing signals",
    ", these searches are using a combination of survey and follow - up observations , where the survey observations ( e.g. , ogle , @xcite ; moa , @xcite ) aim to maximize the lensing event rate by monitoring a large area of sky and the follow - up observations ( e.g. , planet , @xcite ; microfun , @xcite ) intensively monitor the events alerted by the survey observations .",
    "however , the limited number of telescopes restricts the number of events that can be followed at any given time and thus priority is given to those events that will maximize the planetary detection probability .",
    "currently , the highest priority is given to high - magnification events because the source trajectories of these events always pass close to the perturbation region around the planet - induced caustic located near the primary lens @xcite . in addition , follow - up observations can be prepared for these events because the perturbation typically occurs near the peak of the event , which can be predicted from the data on the rising part of the event light curve .",
    "as a result , six ( ogle-2005-blg-071 lb , ogle-2005-blg-169 lb , ogle-2006-blg-109lb , c , moa-2007-blg-400b , moa-2007-blg-192 ) of the eight reported microlensing planets were detected through the channel of high - magnification events @xcite .",
    "in addition to planets , high - magnification events are sensitive to wide - separation binary companions as well .",
    "similar to the planetary case , the companion of a wide - separation binary induces a small caustic close to the primary lens and thus can produce a short - duration perturbation near the peak of a high - magnification event . due to the different nature of the companions , however , the perturbations induced by a wide - separation binary companion and a planet can be distinguished @xcite . therefore",
    ", under the current planetary lensing strategy focusing on high - magnification events , a considerable number of wide - separation binaries are expected to be detected as a byproduct and this sample might provide useful information about the physical distribution of binaries .    unlike this expectation , however , we find that characterizing binaries for a significant portion of the binary lens sample will be difficult due to the degeneracy of the binary - lensing parameters .",
    "this degeneracy arises because the perturbation induced by the binary companion is well approximated by the chang - refsdal lensing ( hereafter c - r lensing ) for binaries with separations greater than a certain value .",
    "the c - r lensing represents single - mass lensing superposed on a uniform background shear . for a wide - separation binary ,",
    "the shear results from the combination of the binary - lens parameters and thus the individual parameters can not be separately determined .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   2 , we briefly describe the properties of binary and c - r lensing . in   3 , we demonstrate the proximity between the binary and c - r lensing for binaries with separations beyond a certain limit .",
    "we then set the range in the binary - lensing parameter space where the degeneracy of binary - lensing parameters occurs .",
    "we discuss the meaning of this degeneracy in the studies of binaries by using microlensing .",
    "we summarize the results and conclude in   4 .",
    "if a source is lensed by a single point mass , the lens mapping from the lens plane to the source plane is expressed by the lens equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the locations of the source and the lens in complex notations , respectively , and @xmath5 denotes the complex conjugates of @xmath6 . here",
    "all angles are normalized by the angular einstein radius of the lens , which is related to the physical parameters of the lens by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass of the lens and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the distances to the lens and source , respectively . solving the lens equation results in two solutions of the image position .",
    "the lensing process conserves the source surface brightness and thus the magnifications of the individual images correspond to the area ratios between the images and source .",
    "mathematically , this is obtained by solving the jacobian of the mapping equation evaluated at the image position , i.e. , @xmath11 then , the total magnification corresponds to the sum of the individual images , i.e. , @xmath12 , and this results in @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the normalized lens - source separation . for a rectilinear motion ,",
    "the lens - source separation is related to the lensing parameters of the einstein time scale @xmath15 , the closest lens - source separation @xmath16 , and the time at the moment @xmath17 by @xmath18^{1/2}.   \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] the light curve of a single - lensing event is characterized by a smooth and symmetric shape @xcite .",
    "if a source is lensed by a binary lens , on the other hand , the mapping equation is expressed as @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the positions of the lens components , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are their masses , and @xmath24 is the total mass of the binary",
    ". one important characteristic of binary lensing that differentiates from single lensing is the formation of caustics , which represent source positions at which the magnification of a point source becomes infinite .",
    "the set of caustics form closed curves , each of which is composed of concave curves ( fold caustic ) that meet at points ( cusps ) .",
    "binary lenses can have one , two , or three closed caustic curves . if the two masses are separated by approximately an einstein radius",
    ", then there is a single six - cusp caustic .",
    "if the masses are much closer than an einstein ring , there is a central four - cusp caustic and two outlying three - cusp caustics . if they are separated by much more than an einstein ring ( wide - separation binary ) , then there are two four - cusp caustics , where each of the caustics is associated with each member of the binary . in addition to the parameters of single lensing , modelling a binary - lensing event",
    "requires two additional lensing parameters of the separation @xmath25 and the mass ratio @xmath26 between the lens components .",
    "the chang - refsdal lensing represents single lensing superposed on a uniform background shear @xcite . the lens equation for the c - r lensing",
    "is represented by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the shear .",
    "the shear induces a single set of caustics , which form around the lens .",
    "the caustic has a shape of a hypocycloid with four cusps .",
    "its size as measured by the separation between two confronting cusps are related to the shear by @xmath29    in the limiting case of a binary lens where the binary separation is much larger than the einstein radius ( @xmath30 ) , the lensing properties in the vicinity of each of the binary lenses is well described by that of the c - r lensing @xcite .",
    "the shear exerted by the companion is related to the binary parameters by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the binary separation normalized by the einstein radius corresponding to the mass of the lens close to which the caustic is located .",
    "the shear decreases as @xmath33 and thus the caustics of a wide - separation binary lens shrink rapidly as the binary separation increases . in the limiting case",
    "where @xmath34 , the shear and the caustics vanish and the individual lens components behave as if they are two independent single lenses . the positions of the lens components effectively working as single lenses , effective lens position @xmath35 , are slightly shifted from their original positions with an offset @xcite @xmath36",
    "the fact that the lensing behavior of a wide - separation binary in the region close to each lens component is well described by the c - r lensing implies that although lens binarity can be noticed from the perturbation to the light curve of a high - magnification event , it may be difficult to determine the binary - lensing parameters from the analysis of the perturbation .",
    "this is because the c - r lensing is described by a single parameter of @xmath28 , which results from the combination of the two binary - lensing parameters of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "then , naturally rising questions are ( 1 ) how serious this degeneracy is and ( 2 ) in which region of the binary - lensing parameter space this degeneracy occurs . to answer these questions , we construct two sets of perturbation pattern maps as a function of the source position in the central region of a component of binary lenses with various separations and mass ratios . in the first set ,",
    "we construct the maps of the fractional magnification residual from that of single lensing , i.e. , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the magnifications of binary and single lensing without the companion , respectively . in the second set ,",
    "we construct the maps of the residual from that of c - r lensing , i.e. , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the magnification obtained from c - r lensing by approximating the shear exerted by the companion as @xmath44 .    figure  [ fig : one ] and [ fig : two ] show the two sets of maps . in each map ,",
    "the coordinates are centered at the effective position of a binary component .",
    "the width of each map is set such that it corresponds to 8 times of the width of the c - r lensing caustic computed by equations ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "the separation and the mass ratio of the binary for each map are marked at the top and on the right side of the panel , respectively .",
    "the mass ratio is such that @xmath45 when the companion is less massive than the lens component around which the map is constructed and vice versa . in each map ,",
    "the regions with blue and brown - tone colors represent the areas where the binary - lensing magnification is lower and higher than the single or c - r lensing magnification , respectively . for each tone , the color changes into darker scales when the residual is @xmath46 , 2% , 5% , and 10% , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : three ] shows light curves of events resulting from the source trajectories marked in figure  [ fig : one ] . in the upper part of each panel , there are three curves : blue curve for single lensing , red curve for c - r lensing , and black curve for binary lensing .",
    "the lower part shows the fractional residuals from the single - lensing magnification ( blue curve ) and the c - r lensing approximation ( red curve ) .",
    "the caustic induced by a wide - separation binary is small and thus perturbations induced by the caustic are vulnerable to finite - source effect .",
    "the finite - source effect is parameterized by the ratio of the source radius @xmath47 to the einstein radius . for a lensing event toward the galactic bulge field ,",
    "this ratio is scaled by the physical parameters of the lens by @xmath48^{-1/2}. \\label{eq13}\\ ] ] then , the magnification affected by the finite - source effect becomes @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the displacement vector of the source center with respect to the lens , @xmath51 is the vector to a position on the source star surface with respect to the center of the source star , @xmath52 represents the source brightness profile , and @xmath53 is the point - source magnification .",
    "we consider the finite - source effect by assuming that the source star has a uniform disk with a radius equivalent to the sun and the physical parameters of the lens system are @xmath54 , @xmath55 kpc , and @xmath56 kpc by adopting the values of a typical event being detected toward galactic bulge field .",
    "this results in @xmath57 . in figure [ fig : one ]  [ fig : three ] , we do not present maps and light curves if the perturbation from single lensing is severely washed out by the finite - source effect and thus the magnification pattern of a binary - lensing case is difficult to be distinguished from that of a single - lensing case .",
    "the residual map from single lensing shows that although the perturbation becomes weaker as the distance to the companion increases , it lasts for a considerable distance .",
    "the maximum distance for the detection of the companion signal depends on the companion / primary mass ratio and the observational precision . by adopting a threshold residual of @xmath58",
    ", we find that companions can be detected up to the separations of @xmath59 , 50 , 63 , and 100 for binary companions with mass ratios of @xmath60 , 1/2 , 1.0 , and 2.0 , respectively .",
    "considering that the physical radius of the einstein ring is @xmath61 , au , these limits correspond to the physical separations of @xmath62 , 95 , 120 , and 190 au , respectively , implying that high - magnification events provide an efficient channel to detect wide - separation binaries .    however , the condition for detection is different from the condition for characterization .",
    "the condition for binary characterization depends on various factors such as real experimental data , photometric errors , sampling rate , observation duration , and telescopes performance .",
    "therefore , it is not easy to define a single observable that can be used for an indicator to judge the characterizability of binary - lens events .",
    "however , if a light curve significantly deviates from c - r lensing approximation , it would be possible to determine the binary - lensing parameters .",
    "the photometric error achieved by the current follow - up observations reaches down to @xmath63 level for high - magnification events ( gould 2008 , private communication ) .",
    "we therefore set the condition for binary characterization such that light curves should be distinguished from the c - r lensing approximation with @xmath64 . with this criterion",
    ", we find that the upper limits of binary separation for characterization are @xmath65 , 20 , 22 , and 25 for binary companions with mass ratios of @xmath60 , 1/2 , 1.0 , and 2.0 , respectively . from the comparison of the limits for detection , the ranges of binary separation for characterization are substantially narrower than the ranges for detection .",
    "this implies that for a significant fraction of events for which signals of wide - separation binary companions are detected , it will be difficult to characterize the properties of the binary by determining the lensing parameters . in figure",
    "[ fig : two ] , we mark this region of degeneracy by blocking the panels with thick solid lines .",
    "we also list the detection and degeneracy regions in table  [ table : one ] .",

    "by investigating the patterns of central perturbations produced by wide - separation binary companions , we found that the perturbation can be noticed and thus lens binarity can be identified for binaries with considerable separations .",
