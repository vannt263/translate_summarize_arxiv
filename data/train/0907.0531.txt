    "@xmath0he can decay not only to two - body @xmath1he+@xmath2 channels , but also to many - body channels of @xmath10he+2@xmath2 and @xmath3he+3@xmath2 , because @xmath1he is a borromean nucleus and breaks up easily into @xmath3he+@xmath2+@xmath2 .",
    "this multiparticle decay condition makes it difficult to settle the excited states of @xmath0he .",
    "in fact , contradictions in the observed energy levels and their spins still remain .",

    "the @xmath14 partner of the ground state is of interest because the @xmath14 splitting energy in @xmath0he gives information on the @xmath14 interaction in drip - line nuclei .",
    "some experiments @xcite report @xmath13 at around 1 mev in the low excitation energy . however , other observations @xcite suggest a little higher excitation energy . the spectroscopic factor associated with the @xmath1he halo state",
    "has also been reported @xcite .    on the theoretical side , _ ab initio _ calculations of the no - core shell model @xcite and the green s function monte calro @xcite",
    "have been performed , and the calculated energies of the ground and @xmath12 states show a good correspondence with the experiments .",
    "the @xmath13 state is predicted at around 3 mev , although the results depend on the choice of the three - nucleon forces @xcite .",
    "those calculations are based on the bound state approximation and the continuum effect from many - body open channels is not included , while the observed @xmath0he states are unbound .",
    "several methods have been proposed to treat the continuum effects explicitly , such as the continuum shell model @xcite and the gamow shell model @xcite .",
    "it is , however , difficult to satisfy the multiparticle decay conditions correctly for all open channels .",
    "the obtained energy spectra and decay widths of he isotopes depend on the treatment of open channels . for the spectroscopy of @xmath0he ,",
    "it is necessary to describe the four - body resonances of the @xmath3he+3@xmath2 system in the theoretical model .",
    "furthermore , it is important to reproduce the threshold energies of the particle decays into subsystems . emphasizing these theoretical conditions , in our previous work @xcite , we investigated the @xmath0he spectroscopy with the appropriate treatment of the decay properties concerned with the subsystems of @xmath15he .",
    "we employed the cluster orbital shell model ( cosm ) of @xmath3he+@xmath4 @xcite , in which the open channel effects of the @xmath1he+@xmath2 , @xmath10he+2@xmath2 and @xmath3he+3@xmath2 decays are taken into account explicitly .",

    "we described the many - body resonances by using the complex scaling method ( csm ) @xcite , under the correct boundary conditions for all decay channels .",
    "in csm , the energies and decay widths of many - body resonances are directly obtained by diagonalization of the complex - scaled hamiltonian with @xmath17 basis functions .",
    "we found five resonances of @xmath0he and investigated their properties , such as energies , decay widths , configurations and spectroscopic factors ( @xmath18 factors ) of the @xmath1he-@xmath2 components .",
    "in particular , @xmath18 factors are important in understanding the coupling between @xmath1he and a last neutron in @xmath0he . in the analysis of the @xmath18 factors of the gamow states of @xmath19he ,",
    "the @xmath18 factors are often described in complex values , because gamow states have complex eigenvalues and their matrix elements are also complex values @xcite .",
    "these complex @xmath18 factors lead to the problem of physical interpretation with respect to the observation , which was discussed in a previous study @xcite . to avoid this problem , in this article",
