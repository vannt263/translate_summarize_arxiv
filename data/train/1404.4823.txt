    "studying stars with ages approaching the age of the universe is of a great importance since they can serve as tracers of the formation and early evolution of galaxies . in particular , they allow us to study the stellar halo which is mainly composed of old stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is believed from observations and simulations that mergers and accretions of smaller systems contributed to the formation of the outer halo ( e.g. @xcite ) while the inner halo is a result of accretion of a few massive systems in addition to in situ star formation processes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these accretion events and mergers leave signatures in the structure and kinematics of the stellar halo , usually in the form of stellar streams , substructures , and overdensities @xcite .",
    "it is easier to detect substructures and overdensities of stars at larger galactocentric distances where the dynamical time scales are longer @xcite .",
    "if the theoretical picture is correct , we expect an inhomogeneous outer halo that is full of streams and substructures from accreted systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the absence of massive and luminous stars , the old main - sequence turn - offs , the prevalence of horizontal branch stars , and the low metallicities of the halo stars indicate that halo stars are predominantly old . however , it is still unclear whether these stars were mainly formed in situ during the early phase of the collapse of the milky way , or whether they were formed outside the milky way in satellite galaxies only to be accreted by the milky way at a later date ( e.g. @xcite ) . answers to such questions",
    "may be found by identifying and characterizing the streams that the satellite galaxies have left in the halo ( e.g. @xcite ) of the milky way where the contamination of foreground stars makes the mapping of stellar structures difficult .",
    "additionally , these streams can serve as very sensitive probes to deduce the shape of the milky way s potential @xcite .",
    "one way of finding streams is by identifying and mapping rr lyrae ( rrl ) stars in the halo .",
    "rrl stars are low - mass , core helium burning pulsating stars that fall on the horizontal branch of a stellar population s color - magnitude diagram .",
    "rrl stars have a mean absolute @xmath3-band magnitude of @xmath4 @xmath5 0.6 @xmath6 0.1 @xcite , which makes them very good distance indicators .",
    "these variable stars are still bright enough to be detected at large distances such as in the halo @xcite . they have been used as tracers of the chemical and dynamical properties of old stellar populations ( e.g. @xcite ) and have served as test objects for theories of the evolution of low - mass stars and for theories of stellar pulsation @xcite .",
    "many of the substructures that were discovered in the milky way were re - confirmed using rrl stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the best and most reliable way to detect rrl stars is by using multi - band time series observations of a sufficiently high cadence and over a sufficiently long period .",
    "rrl stars can be divided into fundamental - mode ( rrab stars ) and first - overtone ( rrc stars ) pulsators",
    ". since rrl stars are short - period pulsating stars with typical mean periods of @xmath0 0.57 and @xmath0 0.34 days for rrab and rrc stars @xcite , respectively , the time between observations is preferred to be short in order to sample the magnitudes of the stars at each phase .",
    "in addition to that , monitoring an rrl star over a long period of time will result in a more accurate and reliable classification and period determination . over the past two decades , colors , variability , and light curve properties of rrl stars",
    "have been well studied and characterized ( e.g. @xcite ) .      in this paper , we use and combine data from different sky surveys out of which each survey has a distinctive advantage that helps in identifying rrl stars with high efficiency ( fraction of true rrl stars in the candidate sample ) , completeness ( the fraction of selected rrl stars ) , and reliability levels .",
    "first , we apply color cuts to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , 8th data release ( dr8 ; @xcite ) .",
    "second , we apply variability cuts using data from the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system 1 3@xmath7 survey ( hereafter ps1 ; @xcite ) . finally",
    ", we plot light curves and find the periods of the rrl stars using the second photometric catalogue from the catalina survey ( csdr2 ; @xcite ) which is based on seven years of multi - epoch observations . using one of the surveys without the others to find rrl stars results in low efficiency and completeness levels ( see section [ usedsurveys ] ) .",
    "in order to define the sdss color selection threshold limits and the ps1 and csdr2 variability threshold limits , we use the color and variability properties of the quasar equatorial survey team ( quest ) rrl star catalogue ( qrrl ; @xcite ) . to compute our efficiency and completeness levels , we compare our results with the rrl stars found in stripe 82 .",

    "@xcite and @xcite independently searched for rrl stars in stripe 82 using the sdss data . because catalog is 100@xmath2 efficient and complete , we use it as a test catalog to compute the efficiency and completeness levels of our method .",

    "accordingly , we compare our rrl star discoveries with the catalogue of rrl stars in stripe 82 @xcite . we also discuss the properties of the rrl stars that we missed .",
    "our catalogue contains 184 rrl stars ( 137 rrab and 47 rrc stars ) in the stripe 82 area , out of which 177 ( 136 rrab and 41 rrc stars ) are also found in the catalogue of rrl stars in stripe 82 @xcite .",
    "the 7 extra rrl stars are found in our catalogue only .",
    "the presence of the extra rrl stars can either prove that our catalog is slightly contaminated by non - rrl stars or that catalog is not 100@xmath2 complete .",
    "our achieved completeness level is distance - dependent because of the magnitude cut ( @xmath16 ) applied and discussed in section [ colorboxes ] .",

    "accordingly , the completeness level will be studied and analyzed in the mentioned distance range .",
    "catalogue contains 337 rrl stars ( 255 and 82 of type ab and c , respectively ) with @xmath12 in the 428 kpc distance range . since we recovered 136 and 41 rrab and rrc stars , respectively ,",
    "our completeness level is then @xmath0 50@xmath2 for rrab and rrc stars .      with our 50@xmath2 completeness level computed in the previous section ,",
    "we know that we missed @xmath0 50@xmath2 of the rrl stars in stripe 82 with @xmath12 in the 428 kpc distance range .",
    "these missed stars either did not have csdr2 information or did not pass the variability cuts in section [ ps1variablity ] ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) .    for example ,",
    "only @xmath0 60@xmath2 of the rrl candidates that passed the sdss color and the ps1 variability cuts had csdr2 data .",
    "the remaining missed stars were either not observed with the catalina survey , or they are located in crowded regions ( e.g. de - blending problems ) where they had a small number of clean csdr2 detections .",
    "another reason for why we missed 50@xmath2 of the rrl stars are the ps1 variability cuts applied in section [ ps1variablity ] .",
    "although most of the missed rrl stars were observed @xmath0 4 times in @xmath19 or @xmath20 , the variability of the missed rrl stars did not appear in the ps1 database .",
    "rrl stars are short period variable stars and are repeating their cycles between @xmath0 1 and @xmath0 5 times a day .",
    "hence , it is likely that some rrl stars were repeatedly observed at the same or a close phase .",
    "nevertheless , we were still able to recover more than 50@xmath2 of the rrl stars with the small number of epochs available from the ps1 at the moment",
    ". the completeness level will be significantly higher when more ps1 epochs are available .",
    "nevertheless , the variability cuts were necessary to distinguish a possible variable from a non - variable star .      among the 184 rrl stars we found in stripe 82 , 137 and 47 are of type ab and c , respectively . out of the 137 rrab stars ,",
