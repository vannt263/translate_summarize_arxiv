    "primary decomposition of ideals and modules has been a mainstay of commutative algebra since its introduction roughly a century ago @xcite . a formally analogous theory for congruences on commutative monoids",
    "made its first appearance around fifty years ago @xcite , and subsequently the topic of decompositions has similarly played a central role in commutative semigroup theory @xcite .",
    "our first goal is to demonstrate that the formal analogy in the setting of finitely generated monoids and congruences  the _ combinatorial setting_fails to capture the essence of primary decomposition in noetherian rings and modules .",
    "we rectify this failure by exhibiting a more sensitive theory of _ mesoprimary decomposition _ of congruences , complete with witnesses , associated prime objects , and other facets of control afforded in parallel with primary decomposition in rings .",
    "we justify our claim of insufficiency of the formal analogy in current use by lifting our witnessed theory of mesoprimary decomposition to the _ arithmetic setting _ : binomial ideals in semigroup rings , comprising the interface of commutative ring theory with finitely generated monoids .",
    "mesoprimary decomposition of binomial ideals is not binomial primary decomposition , but a new type of intersection decomposition for binomial ideals , with numerous advantages over ordinary primary decomposition , such as combinatorial clarity , independence from properties of the ground field , and computational efficiency .",
    "nevertheless , binomial primary decomposition is easily recovered from mesoprimary decomposition , as is binomial irreducible decomposition , which was previously not known to exist ; both are consequently seen to be chiefly combinatorial in nature .",
    "in essence , by lifting mesoprimary decomposition of congruences , binomial mesoprimary decomposition distills the coefficient - free combinatorics inherent in primary decomposition of binomial ideals and isolates the precise manner in which coefficients subsequently determine the primary components .",
    "the subtlety of coefficient arithmetic causes the lifting procedure to fail verbatim translation , thus requiring great care , particularly where redundancy is involved .",
    "part of our study therefore contrasts the slightly different notions of witness and associatedness in the combinatorial and arithmetic settings .      beyond the intrinsic merit of mesoprimary decomposition ,",
    "the need for natural decompositions in the monoid and binomial contexts has become increasingly important in recent years , in view of appearances and applications in numerous areas .",
    "some of these directly involve commutative monoids , such as schemes over  @xmath0 @xcite , where monoids form the foundation just as rings do for usual schemes .",
    "another instance is the arrival of misre quotients in combinatorial game theory , where monoids provide data structures for recording and computing winning strategies @xcite ( see also @xcite for a gentle algebraic introduction ) . at the same time , binomial ideals are finding ever deeper interactions with other parts of mathematics and the sciences , motivating research into applicable descriptions  including computational and combinatorial ones  of their decompositions .",
    "for example , dynamics of mass - action kinetics , where steady states in detailed - balanced cases are described by vanishing of binomial trajectories , arise from stoichiometric exponential growth and decay @xcite ; binomial primary decompositions in mass - action kinetics can identify which species persist or become extinct @xcite . in algebraic statistics , decompositions of binomial ideals give insight into how a set of conditional independence statements among random variables can be realized @xcite .",
    "more generally , the connectivity of lattice point walks in polyhedra can be analyzed using decompositions of binomial ideals @xcite .",
    "these applications rely on decompositions of unital ideals  generated by monomials and differences of monomials  into unital ideals ; these are mesoprimary decompositions ( example  [ e : allunital ] ) .",
    "the algebra , geometry , and combinatorics of binomial primary decomposition interacts with systems of differential equations of hypergeometric type @xcite , whose solutions are eigenfunctions for binomial differential operators .",
    "in fact , it was in the hypergeometric framework that the combinatorics of binomial primary decomposition had its origin @xcite , providing tight control over series solutions .",
    "in the meantime , mesoprimary decomposition serves as an improved method for presenting and visualizing binomial primary decomposition in algorithmic output @xcite . beyond that",
    ", the methods here have already found a theoretical application to combinatorial game theory @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen what impact these methods might have in the other areas of application , such as abelian sandpile models , where binomials record transitions between states in a particular class of chip - firing games @xcite or integer programming , where binomials record feasible directions to step among lattice points monotonically with respect to a cost function ....    ... traditional applications in log geometry , toric varieties , @xmath1-theory ...      staring at output of binomial primary decomposition algorithms intimates that certain primary components belong together .",
    "[ e:8to1 ] during investigations of presentations of misre quotients of combinatorial games ( culminating in the definition of lattice games @xcite ) , macaulay2  @xcite produced long lists of primary binomial ideals . in one instance , eight of the forty or so components were @xmath2 the urge to gather these eight into one piece ( a piece of eight ? ) , namely their @xmath3 is irresistible .",
    "( who would rather sift through the big list ? ) and it would have become more so had the exponents in the single gathered component been odd primes , for then the coefficients in the long list of primary ideals would not even have been rational numbers , though the intersection would still have been rational .    in general ,",
    "a binomial prime ideal  @xmath4 in a finitely generated monoid algebra  @xmath5 $ ] is determined by a monoid prime ideal @xmath6 and a character @xmath7 defined on a subgroup of the local unit group @xmath8 ( theorem  [ t : binomprime ] ) . a  given binomial ideal @xmath9 $ ] ( definition  [ d : i ] ) might possess a multitude of associated primes sharing the same  @xmath10 and  @xmath1 , differing only in the character  @xmath11 .",
    "we originally conceived of _ mesoprimary ideals _ ( definition  [ d : cellular ] ; see also proposition  [ p : one ] ) as data structures for keeping track of primary components for such groups of associated binomial primes .",
    "the term `` group '' here is used in the ordinary , nonmathematical sense , but it is entirely appropriate mathematically : the primary components of a mesoprimary ideal over an algebraically closed field are indexed by the characters of a finite abelian group , namely the quotient @xmath12 of the saturation of  @xmath1 in  @xmath13 ( proposition  [ p : mesoprimcomp ] and remark  [ r : mesoprimcomp ] ) .",
    "the efficiency of space afforded by describing primary decompositions after gathering components into mesoprimary ideals is thus more or less equivalent to writing presentations for a collection of finite abelian groups instead of listing every one of their characters .",
    "the situation is not typically as simple as in example  [ e:8to1 ] . indeed , upon inspecting a binomial primary decomposition",
    ", it can be difficult to determine which mesoprimary ideals ought to occur , and which mesoprimary ideal each primary component ought to contribute to .",
    "furthermore , some primary components of a mesoprimary ideal can be absent , even if the mesoprimary ideal clearly ought to appear .",
    "nonetheless , _ mesoprimary decompositions _ of binomial ideals always exist ( definition  [ d : mesodecomp ] and theorem  [ t : mesodecomp ] ) in a form that realizes our initial intent ( corollary  [ c : irreddecomp ] and theorem  [ t : galois ] ) by canonical primary decomposition of mesoprimary ideals ( proposition  [ p : mesoprimcomp ] and remark  [ r : mesoprimcomp ] ) . in summary ,",
    "mesoprimary decomposition gathers primary components so  that :    1 .",
    "the decomposition into binomial ideals requires no hypotheses on the ground  field ; 2 .",
    "specifying one mesoprimary component takes the place of individually listing all primary components arising from saturated extensions of a fixed character ;  and 3 .",
    "the combinatorics of the components and their associated prime objects accurately and faithfully reflects the combinatorics of the decomposed binomial ideal .",
    "the key role of item  3 , in both the existence and chronological development of mesoprimary decomposition , is discussed at length in the remainder of this introduction .",

    "the mesoprimary decomposition is @xmath21 .",
    "what criterion determines when a set of primary components of an ideal  @xmath16 should be gathered , and when not ?",
    "our answer takes its cues from two sources .",
    "the first cue is arithmetic : the gathering problem has already been solved  quite naturally  when @xmath22 $ ] is a _ lattice ideal _ in a polynomial ring over an algebraically closed field  @xmath23 of characteristic  @xmath24 , for some sublattice @xmath25 ( * ? ? ?",

    "* theorem  3.2 ) .",
    "however , the procedure goes only one way : it is not obvious ( even now , given the results in this paper ) how to reconstruct the combinatorics of a binomial ideal from an arbitrary binomial primary  decomposition .",
    "mesoprimary decomposition of a binomial ideal  @xmath16 is an expression of  @xmath16 as an intersection of _ mesoprimary components _ ( definition  [ d : wwp ] ) , each of which is a mesoprimary ideal  a binomial ideal whose combinatorics feels like that of a primary ideal but whose arithmetic feels like that of a lattice ideal .",
    "an arbitrary intersection of mesoprimary ideals is not a mesoprimary decomposition , even if the intersection is a binomial ideal ; exigent additional conditions must be met regarding the interaction of the combinatorics and the arithmetic of the mesoprimary components , as compared with that of  @xmath16 ( remark  [ r : stronger ] ) . in particular , the combinatorics of  @xmath16",
    "is easily reconstructed from any mesoprimary decomposition , by fiat ( definition  [ d : mesodecomp ] ) .      our first approaches to mesoprimary decomposition reduced to the case of _ cellular _ binomial ideals in polynomial rings ( definition  [ d : cellular ] ) , since all binomial ideals are expressible as intersections of these (",
    "* section  6 ) .",
    "however , our many attempts , complicated by the non - canonical nature of cellular decomposition , and restricted by keeping to polynomial rings , inexorably led us to conclude that a proper combinatorial theory of binomial primary decomposition could be achieved only with input from the language and theory of monoid _ congruences _ ( section  [ s : taxonomy ] ; or see @xcite for more background ) .    every mention of `` combinatorics '' in binomial contexts prior to this point refers to congruences on monoids .",

    "the problem could have been stated for arbitrary congruences , but then every finite poset would be possible , because every finite poset occurs as the set of associated primes of a monomial ideal ( this is a good exercise , but it follows from @xcite ) .",

    "thus problem  [ p : assmeso ] would have the same answer if definition  [ d : mesoass ] had allowed arbitrary witnesses .",
    "nonetheless , this line of thinking indicates that care must be taken in lifting problem  [ p : assmeso ] to the arithmetic setting , where definition  [ d : witness ] requires associated mesoprimes to appear at arbitrary witnesses , not at a subset of all witnesses .",

    "the generalization ought to parallel the manner in which ordinary primary decomposition of ideals in rings extends to primary decomposition of modules over rings . in the arithmetic setting of mesoprimary decomposition",
