    "mrk 178 has odd vla  and stellar morphologies , including : an overall cometary shape in its  disk , two kinematic major axes in the  velocity map , and a stellar disk that extends beyond the  natural - weighted map due to a lack of tenuous gas to the southeast of the disk .",

    "the high density  regions in the north and south of mrk 178 s  disk could be part of a shell that has been created by the hole between them .",
    "this hole was identified as part of a little things project cataloguing and characterizing all of the  holes in the 41 dwarf galaxy sample using the hole quality checks outlined in @xcite ( pokhrel et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . to initially be included in the catalog , the hole structure must be visible in 3 consecutive velocity channels ; mrk 178 s hole is visible in 6 consecutive velocity channels in the natural - weighted cube ( 251 km  s@xmath1  to 258 km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "@xcite also assign each  hole with a quality value of 1 - 9 ( low to high quality ) based on the number of velocity channels that contain the hole , whether the location of the hole s center changes across the velocity channels , the difference in  surface brightness between the hole and its surroundings ( at least 50% ) , and how elliptical the appearance of the hole is in a p - v diagram .",
    "based on these criteria , mrk 178 s hole has a quality value of 6 , which is average quality .",
    "in p - v diagrams the emission around an  hole will create an empty ring or partial ring appearance in the p - v diagram when a hole is present @xcite .",
    "the left side of figure  [ m178_hole ] shows the p - v diagram for mrk 178 s hole . the black ellipse indicates the parameter space of the hole in the p - v diagram",

    "the higher velocity side of the ring may be composed of very tenuous gas or that side of the hole may have blown out of the  disk .     +    with the higher velocity side of the  shell not clearly defined , the estimated expansion rate uncertainty will be high , however , the velocity of the dense edge of the shell can be used to get an estimate of the expansion .",
    "the velocity of the center of this hole is found to be @xmath12260 km  s@xmath1  and the velocity of the intact side of the  shell was taken to be @xmath12244 km  s@xmath1 , resulting in an expansion velocity of 16 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the radius of the hole was taken to be the square root of the product of the major and minor axes of the hole , resulting in a radius of @xmath12180 pc . a hole of this size , expanding at 16 km  s@xmath1 ,",
    "would have taken roughly 11 myr to form .",
    "this calculated age of the hole is a rough estimate , as the expansion rate of the hole may have been much faster when it first formed and the hole looks as though it has blown out of one side of the disk , which means the hole may be older than indicated by its current expansion rate .",
    "the energy needed to create mrk 178 s hole can be estimated using equation 26 from @xcite , which calculates the energy from the initial supernova burst : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the initial energy in units of @xmath30 ergs , @xmath31 is the initial volumetric density of the gas in atoms @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the velocity of the hole s expansion in km  s@xmath1 , and @xmath34 is the radius of the hole in pc . for mrk 178 s hole , @xmath31 was taken to be the approximate density of the surrounding gas .",

    "the component located closer to the center of mrk 178 s stellar disk , at 11h 33 m 28.5s and 491418.3 does look as though it could be in the hole as can be seen in figure  [ m178vla_r]d .",
    "@xcite calculate the ages of the stars in the v - band s bright southern stellar concentration to be @xmath129 myr .",
    "the estimated time needed to create the hole was calculated to roughly be 11 myr , which , given the uncertainties in the hole age calculation , is roughly in line with the 9 myr age of the stellar concentration .",
    "although , interesting on its own , the potential  hole does not easily explain the rest of the  morphology and kinematics : the  is rotating on two separate kinematic major axes ( as discussed in section [ m178vlavel ] ) and the stellar component expands further than the vla natural - weighted  ( as discussed in section [ m178vla_morph ] ) .",
    "the stellar component that expands further than the  data is not located near the  hole and therefore is not likely a result of the hole if it is real .",
    "the two kinematic axes indicate that the gas has been significantly disturbed in the past .",
    "two kinematic major axes and an asymmetric  distribution ( which does not cover the stellar disk ) could indicate that mrk 178 has recently interacted or merged with another galaxy .",
    "there are no known companions close to mrk 178 and the gbt maps do not show any companion to mrk 178 at the sensitivity and resolution of the maps .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that mrk 178 has recently had an interaction with a nearby gas - rich companion . instead , it is possible that mrk 178 is interacting with a gas - poor companion or mrk 178 is the result of a merger still in the process of settling into a regular rotation pattern .",
    "however , if an interaction or merger has caused a significant asymmetry in the gas morphology of the disk and two kinematic major axes , then why does the outer v - band disk not show any signs of a morphological disturbance such as tidal tails , bridges , or significant asymmetries ?",
    "the gaseous disk is collisional and thus has a short term memory of past events ( on the order of one dynamical period ) .",
    "the stellar disk is non - collisional and therefore has a longer memory of past mergers than the gaseous disk .",
    "so , if the gaseous disk is still significantly kinematically and morphologically disturbed , then the outer regions of the older stellar disk ( reaching @xmath1227 mag / arcsec@xmath39 ) would likely still show significant signs of disturbance and yet it appears to be relatively elliptical in shape .",
    "haro 36 is a bcd with a tidal tail visible in its outer v - band disk which has a limiting surface brightness of @xmath1225.5 mag / arcsec@xmath39 .",
    "since haro 36 has a distance of 9.3 mpc , it is reasonable to assume that mrk 178 , at a limiting surface brightness of 27 mag / arcsec@xmath39 and a distance of only 3.9 mpc , would show signs of a tidal disturbance in its outer v - band disk if it existed .",
    "since there are no signs of tidal disturbances in the outer v - band disk , mrk 178 is not likely a merger remnant .",
    "mrk 178 could be interacting with intergalactic gas through ram pressure stripping .",
    "the  intensity map in figure  [ m178vla_na]a has a generally cometary appearance , with a bifucated head of star formation and two gas peaks . each head (  peak ) is also cometary and pointing in the same direction as the whole galaxy , particularly the northern one .",
    "these  heads are likely an indication of a subsonic shock front since they are near a sharp  density edge . to make this structure as well as clear the gas from the southeastern part of the v - band disk , the galaxy could be moving in the southeast direction at several tens of km s@xmath1 into a low density igm that may be too ionized to see in .",
    "if this motion also had a component toward us , then it could account for the strong velocity perturbation in the south ( and the lack of velocity perturbation in the northwest ) , where all the hi gas redshifted relative to the rest of the galaxy is the gas being stripped from the southeast edge of the galaxy and is moving away from us . the hi ` hole ' between the two  peaks discussed in section  [ m178_hihole ] could be a hydrodynamical effect of the streaming intergalactic gas ; the intergalactic gas could be moving between and around each  peak as the galaxy moves through the igm .",
    "alternatively , the ram pressure from this motion could have made or compressed the head region , promoting rapid star formation there or at the leading shock front .",
    "that star formation could then have made the hole discussed in section  [ m178_hihole ] .",
    "this scenario is analogous to that in ngc 1569 @xcite where an incoming  stream apparently compressed the galaxy disk and triggered two super star clusters , which are now causing significant clearing of the peripheral gas .",
    "some parameters of the interaction can be estimated from the pressure in the head region of mrk 178 as observed in hi and starlight . from @xcite the pressure in the interstellar medium ( assuming comparable stellar and gas disk thicknesses )",
    "is approximately : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the gaseous and stellar surface densities , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the gaseous and stellar velocity dispersions , and g is the gravitational constant . in the second term of equation  [ pressure ]",
    ", @xmath43 @xmath44@xmath1 is approximately equal to 1 because the gaseous and stellar velocity dispersions of dwarf irregular galaxies are similar @xcite .",
    "the average hi column density in the southern star formation peak is @xmath45 cm@xmath15  in figure  [ m178vla_na]a , which is @xmath46 pc@xmath15 or @xmath47 g cm@xmath15 when corrected for he and heavy elements by multiplying by 1.35 .",
    "@xcite calculate the properties of a stellar clump in the same region as the star formation peak seen in our figure 1 .",
    "they note that the southern stellar clump of stars ( see their figure 2 ) has a mass inside the galactocentric radius of the southern stellar clump ( 390 pc ) of @xmath48 . assuming the mass is evenly spread over a circular region , @xmath49 pc@xmath15 or @xmath50 g cm@xmath15 .",
    "if we assume that this stellar surface density is also the stellar surface density of the interior of the southern clump , then the pressure in the southern clump is approximately @xmath51 dyne cm@xmath15 .",
    "now we can calculate the ambient density of the igm , @xmath52 , assuming that the internal cloud pressure , p , is equal to the ram pressure , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is mrk 178 s velocity relative to the intergalactic medium . in order for the igm to sweep away the southeastern gas and",
    "perturb the velocity field on only one side of the galaxy , the velocity of mrk 178 relative to the igm has to be comparable to the internal rotational speed of the galaxy , so , the minimum velocity of mrk 178 relative to the igm is @xmath1220 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the igm density that makes the ram pressure , @xmath55 , equal to the internal cloud pressure is : @xmath56 the velocity of mrk 178 relative to the igm is likely much higher than 20 km  s@xmath1  and closer to 100 s of km  s@xmath1 ; therefore , at @xmath54=100 km  s@xmath1  @xmath52 would be 0.0032 @xmath57 . at this density ,",
    "even if the igm has a thickness in the line of sight of 5 kpc and assuming that the gas is all neutral and not ionized ( the igm is probably at least partially ionized ) , the igm would have a column density of @xmath58 or less than 1@xmath16 in the vla maps in figure  [ m178vla_na ] , meaning that the igm would be lost in the noise .",
    "the gbt maps would be able to pick up this level of emission , however , the cloud is still expected to be partially ionized , dropping the column density of the .",
    "also , the relative velocity between mrk 178 and the igm could be higher than 100 km  s@xmath1 , which would lower the required external column density .",
    "therefore the igm may not be visible in the gbt maps either .",
    "the relative motion of mrk 178 and the igm could have cleared the gas out of the southern part of the galaxy , produced a cometary appearance to the main clumps at the leading edge of the remaining interstellar gas in addition to the gas in the galaxy as a whole , and produced the large velocity perturbation and dispersion that are observed in the southern region .",
    "@xcite suggest that the overall cometary shapes of galaxies , such as that seen prominently in mrk 178 s disk , can be explained by extragalactic gas impacting the disk of the galaxy .",
    "the gas in the south of mrk 178 s disk may have experienced a collision with a cloud in the southeast side of the galaxy , pushing the redshifted side of the galaxy to the west .",
    "this scenario would leave the gas in the northwestern edge of the disk relatively undisturbed . when the gas cloud impacted mrk 178 s disk , it would have created a dense shock front in the gas as it moved gas from the southeastern edge of the disk to the west .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the impacting gas cloud is showing up as a region of high density in the south of mrk 178 s disk .",
    "the  hole discussed in section  [ m178_hihole ] could have also been created by the cloud collision .",
    "a gas cloud running into mrk 178 s disk is a situation that is similar to that of ram pressure stripping discussed in section  [ m178_ram_press ] .",
    "the main difference between these two situations is that ram pressure stripping is a steady pressure and a gas cloud impacting the disk is a short lived pressure .",
    "the location of the collision would likely be indicated by the morphological peak in  to the south . to the west of and around the location of the morphological peak ,",
    "mrk 178 s velocity dispersions are slightly increased near 11h32m29s and 1415  to about 13 - 16 km  s@xmath1  ( the surrounding regions have dispersions of @xmath5910 km  s@xmath1 ) , indicating that the gas has been disturbed in this region . assuming that the northwest side of mrk 178 s  disk has been relatively undisturbed by the impacting gas cloud",
    ", we can assume that the southeast side of the  disk used to rotate with velocities redshifted with respect to mrk 178 s systemic velocity .",
    "if a gas cloud impacted the disk opposite to the rotation , we would expect a large increase in velocity dispersion and we would also expect the redshifted velocities to generally get closer to the systemic velocity of the galaxy as the disk gas gets slowed by the impact .",
    "however , the redshifted gas in the southern end of the disk has a velocity relative to the systemic velocity of 10 - 16 km  s@xmath1 , which is similar to the blueshifted gas in the northwestern edge of the disk .",
    "this indicates that the gas cloud has struck mrk 178 s disk either co - rotating with it or in a radial direction parallel to the plane , pushing the gas that was in the southeast part of the disk west and away from us relative to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "if the impacting gas cloud had enough energy to move the eastern edge of the disk to the west , then the binding energy of the gas that was pushed west will be approximately equal to the excess energy that has been left behind by the impacting cloud in the southern region of the disk .",
    "we will assume for simplicity that the angular momentum of the system has a relatively small effect on the energies calculated since the forced motion of the gas in the disk is nearly the same as the rotation speed , so the gas in the disk of the galaxy does not have enough time to turn a significant amount .",
    "the binding energy of the gas that was originally in the southeast end of the disk would be about 0.5m@xmath60 where m@xmath61 is the  mass of the gas that was in the southeast edge of the galaxy ( that now has been pushed west ) and v is the rotational velocity that the gas in the southeast end of the disk had before the impact . assuming that the galaxy was once symmetric , we can use the mass of the northwest ` extension ' ( see section  [ m178himass ] ) as the approximate m@xmath61 , @xmath24 m@xmath23 , and the observed velocity of the edge of the disk in the northeast , corrected for inclination ( b / a=0.49 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to get the rotational velocity of the gas cloud , 18 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "using these numbers , we estimate that the binding energy of the gas that was in the southeast of the disk is @xmath12@xmath62 m@xmath23 km@xmath39 s@xmath15 or @xmath12@xmath63 erg .    next we can estimate the excess energy in the southern  clump : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the  mass of the gas in the southern clump of high  density ( now a mixture of the gas originally in the southeastern edge of the disk and the gas cloud that ran into the disk ) , @xmath66 is the velocity dispersion of the gas in the southern clump of high  density , and @xmath67 is the ambient velocity dispersion .",
    "ispec was used to calculate the mass of the southern clump of high density  by using a box that contained emission south of the declination 491418.5 , resulting in an  mass of @xmath68 m@xmath23 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the dense southern  clump is @xmath1213 km  s@xmath1  and the velocity dispersion of the ambient gas is @xmath129 km  s@xmath1 . using these numbers , the excess energy in the southern dense  clump is @xmath69 m@xmath23 km@xmath39 s@xmath15 or @xmath12@xmath70 erg .",
    "this energy is comparable to the estimated binding energy of the gas that was originally in the southeast of the disk .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the southeastern edge of mrk 178 s disk was struck by a gas cloud that pushed the gas west and away from us , and increased the velocity dispersion .",

    "the vla was able to recover 82% of the gbt mass , although vii zw 403 s gbt mass should be higher since some channels that contain emission from vii zw 403 were excluded from the mass measurement to avoid confusion with the milky way .",
    "the most noticeable morphological peculiarity in vii zw 403 s vla data is the detached gas cloud to the south of the disk in the natural - weighted integrated  intensity map ( figure  [ 7zw403vla_na ] ) . because this feature appears in more than three consecutive channels in the 25@xmath025convolved natural - weighted data cube , as can be seen in figure  [ 7zw403vla_cvl ] , it is unlikely to be noise in the map and is therefore considered real emission .",
    "however , figure  [ 7zw403vla+mw ] shows that there is overlap in velocity between vii zw 403 and hi in the milky way . to make sure that the southern detached cloud is not milky way emission in the foreground of vii zw 403 ,",

    "since the gas at anomalous velocities appears at higher negative velocities than the rest of the gas in the disk in the same line of sight ( see figure  [ 7zw403_pv_veldist ] ) and since the velocity disturbance is highly directional ( northeast to southwest ) , the emission associated with it morphologically extends from the southwestern edge of the disk when individual velocity channels are viewed ( as in the left image of figure  [ 7zw403_blank_example ] ) . both to remove this anomalous gas component from the line of sight and also examine whether it could be an external gas cloud , the aips task blank was used to manually mark - out the regions containing the emission .",

    "the velocity dispersions could also in this case be the result of disturbed gas on both the west and the east side of the disk since the hole could have been expanding into the other side of the disk .",
    "the gas cloud in figure  [ 7zw403_chim]b does have a large mass at 18% of the total mass for vii zw 403 , but , according to dwarf galaxy models in @xcite , dwarf galaxies can have most of their gas expelled , at least momentarily , beyond the stellar disk due to large amounts of stellar feedback ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "therefore , this cloud is not necessarily too large to be material ejected from stellar feedback .",
    "however , it should be noted that the data cubes were searched for  holes as part of the little things project and no holes passed the hole quality checks outlined in @xcite in vii zw 403 ( pokhrel et al . , in prep . ) including the stalled hole suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , in the interest of following up with every potential explanation for vii zw 403 s distorted velocity field , the possibility of a stalled hole ejecting material in the line of sight of the western side of the disk is explored below .",
    "the velocities of the gas cloud in figure  [ 7zw403_chim]b indicate that the most recently ejected material ( closest in projection to the potential hole ) is blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of vii zw 403 .",
    "this indicates that the material would be in the foreground of the disk ( being pushed towards us ) .",
    "the hole would eject material nearly perpendicular to the disk into the foreground of the west side of the galaxy , orienting the disk so that the east side is closest to us and the west side is furthest away .",
    "such an orientation is perpendicular to that expected from the velocity contours .",
    "the rough estimates made by @xcite using the equations in @xcite show that this cavity would have to be made by 2800 stars with masses greater than 7 m@xmath23 .",
    "@xcite did not see evidence for this very large number of stars and suggested that the cavity may have instead been made over a long period of time or was made through consumption when the star formation rate was higher around 600 - 800 myr ago . if the cavity is a hole that broke through the disk roughly 600 - 800 myr ago and the foreground gas cloud is gas that has been expelled from the disk by a now stalled hole , then the hole would require an outflow velocity of only @xmath128 km  s@xmath1  to have moved the gas @xmath124.5 kpc .",
    "this is a reasonable rough estimate for an outflow velocity .",
    "however , when looking at the velocities of the gas cloud , the tip nearest to the potentially stalled hole has a velocity of about @xmath27125 km  s@xmath1  and the disk has a velocity of about @xmath27100 km  s@xmath1  at the same location .",
    "this is a velocity difference of 25 km  s@xmath1 , which is three times larger than our calculated outflow velocity . with an outflow velocity this high",
    ", the approximate time that the gas would require to move 4.5 kpc would be @xmath12180 myr , when the sfr of the disk was lower @xcite .",
    "the velocity field of the underlying disk does still appear disturbed in figure  [ 7zw403_chim]a , so it is likely that the gas cloud extends further to the east to a different velocity . yet , it would be expected to continue the velocity trend seen in the rest of the gas cloud since there is a clear gradient of higher negative velocities towards the northeast tip of the gas cloud .",
    "therefore , the gas cloud s velocity is unlikely to get closer to the velocity of the disk near the potentially stalled hole .",
    "the  velocity dispersions of vii zw 403 s disk without the gas cloud and the velocity dispersions of the gas cloud alone are shown in figure  [ 7zw403_cloudx2 ] . in figure",
    "[ 7zw403_cloudx2]a of the underlying disk velocity dispersions we note that the higher velocity dispersions seen in figure  [ 7zw403vla_na]d are still there with the exception of some decrease where the cloud is in the line of sight .",
    "however , the southwest edge of the disk has higher velocity dispersions than in figure  [ 7zw403vla_na]d , this may be due to the removal of too much gas from the edge of the disk , resulting in the edge of the disk having velocities in figure  [ 7zw403_chim ] that are not the true velocity values . in figure  [ 7zw403_cloudx2]b",
    "the velocity dispersions of the gas cloud are generally @xmath1210 km  s@xmath1  or less .",
    "such low velocity dispersions are inconsistent with turbulent gas that has been ejected from the disk from a hole with outflow velocities of @xmath1225 km  s@xmath1 . for example , dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 4861 has three outflow regions with  expansion velocities of 25 km  s@xmath1  and velocity dispersions of @xmath1220 km  s@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the low velocity dispersions in vii zw 403 s gas cloud are instead consistent with cold gas in the line of sight of vii zw 403 .",
    "considering all of the evidence against outflow from an  hole , this gas cloud has probably not been expelled by supernova explosions and stellar winds .",
    "+      another possible explanation for the gas cloud in figure  [ 7zw403_chim]b is an external cloud of gas ( potentially igm ) that is in the line of sight of vii zw 403 . an external gas cloud would explain vii zw 403 s high  mass - to - light ratio relative to other bcds @xcite . with a mass of @xmath12@xmath74 ,",
    "the gas cloud is a reasonable size to be a starless gas cloud near the disk with igm origins @xcite .",
    "the integrated  intensity map of the external gas cloud is shown in figure  [ 7zw403_foregroundhi]c in colorscale with the contours of the remaining disk s integrated  intensity map .",
    "the cloud has an  column density peak near a declination of 78  59 .",
    "it is likely that some of the southwestern edge of the disk was included in the  map of the line - of - sight gas cloud during the process of using blank , which could explain the entirety of the cloud s peak in .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ 7zw403_chim]a as the southwestern edge of the disk looks as though it may be missing , but it is also possible that the  peak in the colorscale of figure  [ 7zw403_foregroundhi]c is , at least in part , the  peak of a gas cloud being consumed by vii zw 403 .",
    "it is possible that some of the external gas cloud has not been removed from the main  disk in figures  [ 7zw403_chim ] and [ 7zw403_foregroundhi ] due to the nature of the manual identification of the cloud or due to overlapping velocities in the disk and gas cloud .",
    "for example , some of the structure that @xcite labeled as a potentially stalled hole denoted by the white circle in figure  [ 7zw403_foregroundhi]b can still be seen in the contours of the remaining disk in figure  [ 7zw403_foregroundhi]c as a small second  peak to the north of the dense  region .",
    "the structure inside and on the north and west edges of the white circle in figure  [ 7zw403vla_r]a lines up well with the external gas cloud s northern edge and could actually be resolved structure of the external gas cloud .",
    "the velocities of the gas cloud , in this case , can not tell us which side of the disk ( foreground / background ) the cloud is on .",
    "if the northeastern edge of the cloud is closest to the disk , then the gas cloud would be in the background of the disk falling towards it and potentially impacting it .",
    "if the southeastern edge of the cloud is closest to the disk , the cloud is then falling away from us and towards the disk in the foreground of the disk .",
    "the velocity dispersions are nearly constant along the east - west axis in figure  [ 7zw403vla_na ] .",
    "this implies that if there is a foreground / background gas cloud extending across vii zw 403 s kinematic major axis , then that cloud must have a velocity gradient similar to that of vii zw 403 s disk ( with offset velocities in the same line of sight ) . assuming that the velocity gradient of the gas cloud seen in figure  [ 7zw403_chim ] continues into the line of sight of the disk",
    ", then it seems plausible that the velocity dispersion could stay nearly constant through the kinematic major axis of vii zw 403 .",
    "also , if we assume that the cloud is falling into vii zw 403 , then the gas cloud would acquire about the same velocity gradient as vii zw 403 s disk .",
    "it is possible that the velocity dispersions on the east side of the galaxy are from the external gas cloud running into the disk and pushing gas in the center of the disk from the west , which in turn , is pushing on gas on the east side of the disk .",
    "if this is the case , then the northeastern end of the external gas cloud would be impacting the disk and the gas cloud would be falling towards us and towards the disk from behind the disk .",
    "the location of the star forming region may also have been affected by the external gas cloud running into the disk over some time .",
    "the densest star forming region , seen in figure  [ 7zw403_star ] , is offset to the east of the center of the main v - band disk .",
    "when the gas cloud impacted the disk , it would push gas from behind the disk towards us and to the east .",
    "this may have caused star formation in the compressed gas that is located in the east of the disk and extending out towards us .",
    "if this is the case , then the new stars would visually be in the line of sight of the far side of the stellar disk since they are in the foreground and presumably not at the edge of the disk . the v - band image in figure  [ 7zw403_star ] thus shows that the west side of the disk would be the near side of the disk .",
    "as the external gas cloud continues to be consumed by vii zw 403 , it could trigger another burst of star formation in the galaxy .",
    "the cloud has a mass of @xmath12@xmath74 and @xcite suggest that a mass of @xmath75 is required for a burst of star formation .",
    "considering the uncertainties associated with distance calculations , the gas cloud in the line of sight of vii zw 403 is potentially large enough to trigger another burst of star formation in vii zw 403 if it strikes the disk retrograde to its rotation as discussed in @xcite",
    ".    the gas cloud may also be the remnants of a past merger .",
    "however , without tidal arms or double central cores , there is not much evidence for something as dramatic as a merger in vii zw 403 .",

    "the kinematically distinct gas in figure  [ n3738_pv ] can not , however , account for the high velocity dispersions seen in the northeast side of the galaxy .",
    "there are no tidal tails or bridges that are apparent in the  maps of ngc 3738 ; however , it is possible that ngc 3738 is an advanced merger .",

    "although it is possible that ngc 3738 is an advanced merger , the lack of obvious tidal tails in either the stellar or gaseous disk means that we do not have evidence to state with certainty that ngc 3738 is an advanced merger .",
    "unique features of ngc 3738 , such as the gas clouds to the west and north of the main  disk , an optical disk that extends beyond the main  disk in the vla natural - weighted intensity maps , and high  velocity dispersions ( see figure  [ n3738vla_na ] ) , could be an indication that ram pressure stripping is taking place .",

    "other dwarf galaxies in little things can also provide insight into characteristics of bcds . a general feature that is prominent in all of the bcds ( perhaps with the exception of ngc 3738 unless the external gas clouds are counted ) is significant morphological asymmetries in the gaseous disk @xcite .",

    "there are also multiple gas clouds around the disk that are moving at approximately the systemic velocity of ngc 3738 .",
    "these gas clouds may have been pushed outside of ngc 3738 s main  disk due to stellar feedback .",
    "it is also possible that the gas clouds external to the disk may have been ejected from the main  disk during a past merger than ngc 3738 has undergone .",
    "another possibility is that ngc 3738 is experiencing face - on ram pressure stripping from ionized igm .",
    "whether they have had their starburst triggered through mergers , interactions , or consumption of igm , it is apparent that each bcd is different and requires individual assessment to understand what has happened to it",
    ". this may be true for modeling what each bcds past and future may look like .",
    "if bcds have been triggered through different means , then there is no guarantee that they will evolve into / from the same type of object .",
    "different triggers for bcds may also explain why it is so difficult to derive strict parameters to define this classification of galaxies ( for examples of definitions of bcds see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if they have been triggered differently , then their parameters likely span a much larger range than if they were all triggered in the same manner .",

    "during calibration the off - frequency spectrum is shifted to the on - frequency spectrum s central frequency and subtracted from the on - spectrum .",
    "if a source is within @xmath123.5 mhz of the target s usable frequency range ( also @xmath123.5 mhz in width , therefore the other source can be up to 5.25 mhz away from the central frequency of the target source ) , then the unwanted source that was originally 1.75 - 5.25 mhz away from the spectrum will appear closer in frequency space to the target source as a negative dip in intensity .",
    "the unwanted source reduces the amount of frequency space that can be used to estimate the zero - emission baseline for subtraction .",
    "two sources were located outside of the target frequency range in ngc 3738 s data and with calibration , have been reflected into ngc 3738 s target frequency range : ngc 3733 ( north of ngc 3738 ) and ngc 3756 ( south of ngc 3738 ) .",
    "the real emission from ngc 3733 and ngc 3756 is very far away from ngc 3738 in velocity space ( a difference of @xmath12960 km  s@xmath1and 1100 km  s@xmath1 , respectively ) .",
    "it is therefore very unlikely that these sources are interacting with ngc 3738 .",
    "the spectra of the approximate space that ngc 3733 covered were summed and averaged to get a clear picture of where it is in frequency space ; the resulting labeled spectrum can be seen in figure  [ n3738_pitag ] .",
    "this spectrum has not had a baseline fit to it or the rfi removed from it , which is why the spectrum appears to have no zero line of emission and there are also spikes at @xmath121.414 mhz and @xmath121.420 mhz . the milky way and its reflection",
    "have been labeled as such .",
    "the source with emission located at 1414.3 - 1415.3 mhz is ngc 3733 , which has been reflected into the target frequency range at 1417.8 - 1418.8 mhz .",
    "the frequency range that ngc 3733 occupies in the target frequency range could therefore no longer be used as zero emission space in a baseline fit . if it was used or partially used , then this could result in a fake source at its location and generally poor fits since a low order polynomial is being fit to the baseline .",
    "an example of a fit using the frequency range that includes the reflections of these sources can be seen in the top of figure  [ n3738_pitag_fit ] .",
    "a second example of a fit using frequency ranges that do not overlap with the reflected source can be seen in the bottom of figure  [ n3738_pitag_fit ] .",
    "an averaged spectrum of ngc 3738 s emission is shown in figure  [ n3738_spectra ] . in this spectrum ,",
    "ngc 3738 peaks at a frequency of 1419.3 mhz , and its reflection appears at a frequency of 1415.8 mhz .",
    "the reflection now occurs outside of the target frequency range .",
    "the emission of ngc 3738 and the reflection of ngc 3733 consume most of the target frequency range , leaving very little room to fit to a baseline .",
    "some of the emission and reflection - free space outside of the target frequency range could be used for baseline fitting when the baseline appears continuous , but using a significant portion of the target frequency range is necessary for a good fit .",
    "there is also the added problem of another source , ngc 3756 , being reflected into the target frequency range .",
    "ngc 3756 s averaged spectrum is shown in figure  [ n3738_topsource ] . in this figure , ngc 3756 has emission at 1415 mhz and has a reflection at 1418.5 mhz .    with ngc 3733 , ngc 3756 , and ngc 3738 on the gbt maps stretching throughout the target frequency range , it was impossible to fit one single baseline to all three sources .",
    "luckily , all three sources are separated in galactic latitude .",
    "therefore , the solution to the baseline problem was to split the gbt map into four spatial regions , with different baseline fit parameters for each region .",
    "the first region included the raster scan rows ( in galactic latitude ) that contained only ngc 3733 .",
    "the second region included only the raster scan rows that contained ngc 3738 .",
    "the third region included ngc 3756 .",
    "the fourth region included everything else .",
    "the baseline fit used for ngc 3738 was also used for this fourth region so that any sources close to ngc 3738 in velocity could be fit properly .",
    "the rows with ngc 3733 and ngc 3756 also had their emission - free pixels searched for any possible emission that could be related to ngc 3738 or a companion .",
    "this was done by averaging 10 spectra at a time to look for possible emission in the resulting averaged spectrum .",
    "the exceptions to this 10-spectra - averaging were the spectra close to the reflected sources and the last four spectra of each row , where fewer spectra were available for averaging , but still averaged for inspection .",
    "no sources related to ngc 3738 were found in the target frequency range .",
    "this method gives the four different regions slightly different noise levels , but the effect is relatively small with the rms values of the regions over @xmath1210 km  s@xmath1  ranging from 3.8 to 4.5 @xmath0 10@xmath79 cm@xmath15 .",
    "these rms values are likely higher than the overall rms over 10 km  s@xmath1  for the entirety of ngc 3738 s gbt map because they were measured over smaller regions .",
