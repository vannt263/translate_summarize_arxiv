    "among hadrons the pion plays very special role because it has the mass much lighter than other hadronic states . in theory",
    "it appears as a result of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and gains its small mass due to small masses of nonstrange current quarks .",
    "it seems that confinement forces do not play any significant role in formation of the pion as a bound state .",
    "studies of the pion have long history and at the moment the processes with pion participation is one of standard hadronic background . from other side new highly - precise experiments related to rare decays or form factors at large momentum transfer",
    "serve as an important independent way to search for physics beyond the standard model and as test of the qcd dynamics . at the moment",
    ", there are some problems with the matching of the experimental data with the predictions of the sm .",
    "the most famous one is the discrepancy by three standard deviations between experiment @xcite and sm theory @xcite for the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( amm ) .",
    "another example is similarly large deviation between the recent precise experimental result on the rare @xmath2 decay into @xmath3 pair @xcite and the sm prediction @xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies of the muon amm @xmath0 ( see for review @xcite ) , the rare decays of light pseudoscalar mesons into lepton pairs @xcite and the comparison with the experimental results , offer an important low - energy tests of the sm .",
    "the discrepancy between the present sm prediction of the muon amm and its experimental determination @xcite is @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) @xcite . the theoretical error is dominated by hadronic corrections .",
    "they are the vacuum polarization ( hvp ) and light - by - light ( lbl ) contributions .",
    "the latter can be estimated only in model dependent way .",
    "the latest results are the calculations of the pseudoscalar hadronic channel contribution within the instanton quark model @xcite and the calculations within the so called @xcite dyson - schwinger equation approach . in @xcite in the full kinematic dependence of the meson - two - photon vertices from the virtualities of the mesons and photons is taken into account .",
    "it is demonstrated that the effect of the full kinematic dependence in the meson - photon vertices is to reduce the contribution of pseudoscalar exchanges comparing with the most of previous estimates and the result is @xmath6 .",
    "the knowledge of the eta( ) meson couplings to virtual photons is important for the calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , being pseudoscalar exchange the major contribution to the hadronic light - by - light scattering . for illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig : compff ] we present on the same plot the vertex @xmath7 in the timelike region @xmath8 and the vertex @xmath9 in the spacelike region @xmath10 as they look in the the instanton quark model ( n@xmath11qm ) and vector meson dominance model ( vmd ) .",
    "these two special kinematics match at zero virtuality @xmath12 .",
    "the remarkable feature of this construction is that the first kinematics is connected with the decay of pseudoscalar mesons into two photons at physical points @xmath13 , while the second kinematics is relevant for the light - by - light contribution to the muon amm .",
    "thus , the part of fig .",
    "[ fig : compff ] at @xmath14 describes the transition of the pion - two - photon vertex from the physical points of meson masses to the point with zero virtuality , which is the edge point of the interval where the integrand is defined . in vmd type of models",
    "there is no such dependence on the meson virtuality .",
    "thus , the value of this vertex at zero meson virtuality is the same as the value of the vertex at the physical points of meson masses , @xmath15 .",
    "however , the @xmath16 and @xmath17 mesons are much heavier than the pion and such extrapolation is too crude .",
    "one can see that for @xmath16 and particularly for @xmath17 the difference between the values of the vertex at physical and zero virtuality points is large , @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the contributions of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 mesons to the muon amm evaluated in n@xmath11qm are strongly suppressed as compared with the vmd results that can only be considered as upper estimates of these contributions .    in @xcite the hadronic lbl contribution to the muon amm using the framework of dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) with the result @xmath20 that is bigger than most previous estimates .",
    "it is not easy to understand this result , in particular , in view of discussion in @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is instructive to compare the results on hadronic vacuum polarization contribution in the instanton @xcite and dse @xcite based models . in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that the dominant hvp contribution to muon amm comes from the dynamical quark loop and contribution of the @xmath21 meson is highly suppressed , while in @xcite the opposite conclusion was made .",
    "it is still open question what model is more adequate in these calculations .",
    "the situation with the rare decays of the light pseudoscalar mesons into lepton pairs became intriguing after the ktev e799-ii experiment at fermilab @xcite in which the pion decay into an electron - positron pair was measured with high accuracy ( @xmath23 ) @xmath24 the standard model prediction gives @xcite @xmath25 which is @xmath26 below the ktev result ( [ ktev ] ) .",
    "other pseudoscalar mesons rare decays into lepton pair are also well suited as a test of the standard model ( see table ) . from experimental point of view",
    "the most interesting are the decays of @xmath16 and @xmath17 to muon pair .",
    "the branchings for these processes theoretically bounded as from below as well from the above @xcite .",
    "further independent experiments for @xmath27 at wasaatcosy @xcite and for @xmath28 kloe @xcite and bes iii @xcite and other facilities will be crucial for resolution of the problem with the rare leptonic decays of light pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "more precise data on the transition form factors in wider region of momentum transfer are expected soon from the babar , belle ( at large momentum transfer ) and kedr , kloe @xcite ( at small momentum transfer ) collaborations .",
    "these data would allow to make more accurate theoretical predictions .",
