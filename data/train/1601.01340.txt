    "the similarity in shape of the theoretical and experimental results for @xmath51  ev up to @xmath56  a.u . is striking .",
    "the general trend of the theoretical curve lying below the experimental points is attributed to the fact that only a limited number of excitation channels have been accounted for ( up to @xmath45 ) . in the case of the sdcs incorporation of all excitation channels in an approximate way increased the cross section by 20%  @xcite .",
    "this fact , we believe , explains the small difference between theory and experiment for low momentum transfers",
    ". an analogous approximation on the level of amplitudes is not possible without introducing arbitrary phases of excitation amplitudes causing unpredictable changes in the ddcss .",
    "therefore , we refrain from extrapolating the excitation amplitudes for @xmath57 .    the sudden decrease of ddcss at around @xmath58  a.u .",
    "at small electron energies seen in  @xcite is now deemed to be an artifact caused by the limited experimental momentum acceptance  @xcite .",

    "the agreement between theory and experiment is less satisfying for the two higher outgoing - electron energies ( @xmath59 and 20  ev ) . while the general trend of the experimental results appears to be reproduced the extended plateaus between @xmath60  a.u . to @xmath61  a.u . and @xmath60  a.u .",

    "[ sec : theory ] has a different dependence on the transverse momentum transfer @xmath10 for different outgoing - electron energy @xmath9 .",

    "the ddcss for processes with the inner - shell electron detachment as the ionization channel , as well as the shake process [ ( i),(ii ) , and ( iv ) ] resemble the sae results , i.e. , they have narrow maxima at low values of the momentum transfer and decrease rapidly with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "the ei2 ddcs , on the other hand , peaks at larger @xmath10 and decreases less rapidly as @xmath10 increases .",

    "while all the processes from ( i ) to ( iv ) play an important role in increasing the overall ddcs to match the experimental values at low @xmath10 , it is the ei2 process that is responsible for the broadening of the ddcs such that it agrees well with the experiment at @xmath51  ev ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .    as the energy of the outgoing electron @xmath9 increases ,",
    "the partial ddcs shapes for all the aforementioned processes , except the ei2 process , remain practically unchanged and only the overall strength diminishes . in particular",
    "the shake off process becomes negligible at @xmath63  ev .",
    "the ddcs for the ei2 process , on the other hand , is clearly suppressed , changing the shape most noticeably ( see figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] ,  [ fig3 ] , and  [ fig4 ] ) : the maximum moves to higher momentum transfers as @xmath9 increases .",
    "this trend allows us to explain the broadening of the experimental ddcs , as well as the appearance of knees described in the previous subsection .",
    "hence , it can be concluded that the shift of the maximum in the ei2 ddcs with increasing outgoing - electron energy is responsible for the broadening of the overall ddcs .",
    "this feature improves the agreement with the experimental data for most of the transverse momentum transfer range .",
    "finally , we note that calculations for the h@xmath41-li system at 6  mev / amu have shown that for weak perturbations the role of multielectron processes becomes negligible .",

    "the cause of the observed discrepancy between theory and experiment for these systems remains unknown , but can perhaps be attributed to electron correlations that are not accounted for in our model .",

    "this approach allowed us to explain the experimental ddcss for the o@xmath0-li collision system at 1.5  mev / amu .",
    "we attribute the leading role in broadening the ddcss as compared to sae cdw - eis results to excitation - ionization processes , in particular , the ei2 process .",
