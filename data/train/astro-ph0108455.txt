    "ground based atmospheric erenkov technique is , at present , the only way by which vhe @xmath0rays from astronomical objects are detected . using this technique tev @xmath0rays have been detected successfully from a number of galactic sources including pulsars , supernova remnants etc as well as from extra - galactic objects which are agns of blazar class .",
    "there are a number experiments based on this technique operating across the globe using either angular imaging technique or wavefront sampling technique .",
    "these are two complementary ways of studying the erenkov emission from air showers generated by @xmath0rays from astronomical sources .",
    "imaging technique has been successfully exploited by several experiments including whipple , cat , cangaroo , hegra , tactic etc . on the other hand ,",
    "the experiments like celeste , stacee , solar-2 , graal and pact are based on wavefront sampling technique .",
    "these experiments consist of an array of erenkov telescopes which sample the erenkov pool at the observation level .",
    "these experiments measure the arrival time of erenkov shower front and erenkov photon density at various locations in the erenkov pool . in this paper",
    "we discuss some of the design aspects and performance parameters of pachmarhi array of erenkov telescopes or pact , which is based on wavefront sampling technique .",
    "pachmarhi array of erenkov telescopes is located at pachmarhi ( latitude 22@xmath1 28@xmath2 n , longitude 76@xmath1 26@xmath2 e , altitude 1075 m ) in central india .",
    "this array consists of 5 @xmath3 5 array of 25 v cerenkov telescopes spread over a rectangular area of 80 @xmath11 @xmath3 100 @xmath11 ( see figure 1 ) . spacing between the telescopes",
    "is 20 @xmath11 in e - w direction and 25 @xmath11 in n - s direction .",
    "each telescope consists of seven para - axially mounted parabolic reflectors of diameter 0.9 @xmath11 each with @xmath12 ratio being @xmath4 1 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "these reflectors are fabricated indigenously and their optical quality is such that the size of the image of a point source is @xmath13 1@xmath1 .",
    "they are back - coated and their reflectivity in visible range is @xmath4 70% .",
    "these reflectors are mounted in hexagonal pattern and total reflector area per telescope is @xmath4 4.45 m@xmath6 .",
    "a fast phototube of the type emi9807b is mounted at the focus of each reflector .",
    "field of view defined by the photo - cathode diameter is @xmath4 3@xmath1 fwhm .",
    "telescopes are equatorially mounted and each telescope is independently steerable in both e - w and n - s direction within @xmath1445@xmath1 .",
    "the movement of telescopes is remotely controlled by automatic computerized telescope orientation system ( actos ) .",
    "the hardware consists of a semi - intelligent closed loop stepper motor system which senses the angular position using a gravity based transducer called clinometer with an accuracy of 1@xmath2 .",
    "the two clinometers , one each in n - s and e - w direction , are accurately calibrated using stars .",
    "the system can orient to the putative source with an accuracy of @xmath4 ( 0.003 @xmath14 0.2 ) .",
    "the source pointing is monitored at an accuracy of @xmath40.05@xmath1 and corrected in real time whenever the error exceeds 0.05@xmath1 .",
    "high voltages to individual phototubes are applied through a computerized control system ( called carams , computerized automated rate adjustment and monitoring system ) and voltages as well as count rates from individual phototubes are continuously monitored .",
    "array is divided into four sub - groups or sectors of six telescopes each for data acquisition . at the centre of each sector",
    "there is a field signal processing centre ( fspc ) .",
    "pulses from phototubes are brought to the respective stations using low attenuation coaxial cables of the type rg213 , of length @xmath4 40 @xmath11 .",
    "these pulses are processed by front end electronics in the fspc and informations such as v cerenkov photon density ( adc ) and arrival time of erenkov shower front at the mirror given by tdc ( resolution 0.25 @xmath15 ) and event arrival time ( utc ) correct to 1 @xmath16 are recorded .",
    "the adc and tdc data are recorded for six peripheral mirrors of each telescope .",
    "in addition to this , some information relevant to the entire array is recorded by master signal processing centre ( mspc ) in the control room at the centre of the array .",
    "this information includes relative arrival time of erenkov shower front at individual telescopes , absolute arrival time of the shower front accurate to @xmath16 derived from a real time clock .",
    "the real time clocks ( rtc ) in fspc s and mspc s are synchronized with each other and with a gps clock . using rtc information events recorded in individual fspc s",
    "are collated with those recorded in mspc off - line .",
    "data recording in mspc as well as in fspc is carried out using networked linux based system .",
    "details of the data acquisition system are given elsewhere ( bhat _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001a ) .",
    "this array is fully operational since december , 2000 .",
    "preliminary results obtained from observations carried out by this array on sources including crab nebula and mkn 421 are discussed elsewhere ( vishwanath _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 and bhat _ et al . _ , 2001b ) .",
    "the night sky background ( nsb ) is the limiting factor in detecting erenkov photons from low energy primaries and this decides the low energy threshold of the experiment .",
    "the nsb measured at pachmarhi , over the range of the spectral response of the phototube , is @xmath4 3.3 @xmath3 10@xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "no . of photo - electrons per telescope",
    "curve corresponds to simulated data .",
    "observed trigger rate is indicated by a point with error bar .",
    "also shown in figure is the threshold energy ( scale on right ) as a function of number of photo - electrons per telescope for @xmath0rays and protons .",
    "lower panel shows the observed trigger rate @xmath19 number of sectors .",
    "also shown are the expected trigger rates with photo - electron threshold of 50 and 60 per telescope , based on simulations.,width=313 ]    in order to estimate the expected performance of the array , large number of @xmath0ray and proton showers are simulated taking into account various design features of the array . for @xmath0ray primaries",
    ", energies are chosen from a power law spectrum with a slope of -1.4 over the range of 500 gev to 20 tev .",
    "whereas for protons , slope of the spectrum is -1.66",
    ". factors like atmospheric attenuation , reflectivity of mirrors , quantum efficiency of phototubes , attenuation in cables etc . are taken into account in simulations .",
    "same trigger criteria as used in the experiment are applied to the simulated events . in the experiment ,",
    "the seven individual mirror outputs are added to get the analog sum called the ` royal sum ' for each telescope .",
    "each sector has six royal sum pulses corresponding to six telescopes .",
    "the royal sums are discriminated to yield a counting rate of @xmath20 .",
    "a trigger is generated when at least four out of six royal sums are present . from the simulated data ,",
    "the trigger rates were obtained for each sector for various photo - electron thresholds ranging from 35 to 100 .",
    "the variation of trigger rate as a function of photo - electron threshold is shown in figure 3 ( upper panel ) .",
    "the observed trigger rate is also shown .",
    "it can be seen that the trigger rate corresponds to the threshold of about 55 photo - electrons per telescope .",
    "lower panel of figure 3 shows the experimental trigger rates when the number of sectors increased from 1 to 4 .",
    "the overall trigger rate essentially varies as the square root of total mirror area .",
    "it increases from about 4 hz for a one sector to 9 hz when all the four sectors are used . also shown in the figure",
    "are the expected trigger rates from simulated data , for photo - electron thresholds of 50 and 60 per telescope .",
    "it can be seen that for all the cases , from single sector trigger rate to the entire array , experimental data is consistent with the trigger rate of about 55 photo - electrons per telescope .",
    "all the simulated events are again examined taking into account photo - electron threshold of 55 photo - electrons per telescope .",
    "figure 4 shows the differential energy spectra for both @xmath0ray and proton events .",
    "the peaks of these distributions give the energy thresholds of the array .",
    "these are 900 gev for @xmath0rays and 2250 gev for protons .",
    "ray and proton initiated showers .",
    "the peak of the energy spectrum or energy threshold is about 900 gev for @xmath0rays.,width=313 ]    rays and protons .",
    "for both the species lower curve is for single sector and upper one for entire array.,width=313 ]    for each simulated event , the collection area is calculated .",
    "figure 5 shows the collection radius for single and all the sectors of the array for showers initiated by @xmath0rays and protons .",
    "it should be noted that the relatively large collection radius ( defined as the radius containing 67% of the events ) of the pact is essentially due to the large extent of the array .",
    "the saturation at large values of collection radius occurs because the events were generated only upto 300 m radius .",
    "sensitivity of the experiment is minimum detectable flux of @xmath0rays in presence of background of cosmic rays .",
    "it is related to the signal to noise ratio given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the @xmath0ray spectral index , @xmath23 the effective collection area , @xmath24 observation duration and @xmath25 the solid angle of the telescope .    for pact , @xmath26 sensitivity for an observation duration of 50 hours , above energy threshold of 1 tev ,",
    "is estimated to be @xmath4 4.1 @xmath3 10@xmath27 @xmath28 for no background rejection .",
    "the angular resolution of pact is estimated to be @xmath4 0.1@xmath1 ( majumdar _ et al . _ , 2001 ) .",
    "this allows the rejection of about 99% of off - axis background events using the arrival angle information alone . according to simulation studies , it is possible to reject a significant fraction of cosmic ray proton showers based on the information about arrival time of shower front at various telescopes ( chitnis and bhat , 2001 ) and fluctuations in density of erenkov photons at different telescopes ( bhat and chitnis , 2001 ) .",
    "we assume that at least 75% of the background showers can be rejected using simulation based cuts .",
    "it may be mentioned here that the rejection efficiency of cosmic rays is much better than what is assumed here , as per simulation studies .",
    "however , we have not yet applied these cuts to the actual data .",
    "hence we assumed an extremely conservative figure of hadron rejection efficiency . as a result , at least 99.75% of the cosmic ray showers enetering the field of view could be rejected .",
    "accordingly , the sensitivity improves to @xmath4 4.1 @xmath3 10@xmath8 @xmath18 .",
    "the efficiency of retaining @xmath0ray showers while exercising cuts for rejecting hadronic showers is estimated to be @xmath4 44% .",
    "based on these conservative estimates , the minimum duration of observation required to detect crab nebula at a significance level of 5@xmath7 is @xmath29 8 hours ( 4 hours on source and 4 hours off source ) . the sensitivity of pact is compared with the present and future atmospheric erenkov experiments in figure 6 .    it is pleasure to thank a. i. dsouza , p. j. francis , s. r. joshi , m. s. pose , p. n. purohit , k. k. rao , s. k. rao , s. k. sharma , a. j. stanislaus and p. v. sudershanan for their participation in various aspects of the experiment ."
