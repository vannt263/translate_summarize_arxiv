    "theory on singular manifolds is a very rich subject that has led to many important insights . for geometries that develop an isolated singularity , one can model the local behaviour using a non  compact manifold . in this case ,",
    "a natural geometric boundary condition is for the metric to asymptote to a cone away from the singularity .",
    "this means that one studies a family of metrics that asymptotically approach the conical form [ cone ] g_x = r^2 + r^2 g_lwith @xmath0 a compact riemannian manifold .",
    "the dynamics of string theory or m  theory on special holonomy manifolds that are developing an isolated conical singularity @xmath1 , with metric ( [ cone ] ) , has proved to be an extremely intricate subject .",
    "a particularly interesting setting is in the context of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "the worldvolume theory of a large number of d3branes placed at an isolated conical calabi ",
    "yau 3fold singularity is expected to flow , at low energies , to a four  dimensional @xmath2 superconformal field theory . in this case , the ads / cft conjecture states that this theory is dual to type iib string theory on ads@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "similar remarks apply to m ",
    "theory on conical eight  dimensional singularities with special holonomy , which lead to superconformal theories in three dimensions that are dual to ads@xmath4 , although far less is known about this situation .",
    "the focus of this paper will be on conical calabi ",
    "yau singularities , by which we mean ricci  flat khler metrics of the conical form ( [ cone ] ) .",
    "this gives , by definition , a sasaki  einstein metric on the base of the cone @xmath5 .",
    "we tacitly assume that @xmath5 is simply  connected which , although not entirely necessary , always ensures the existence of a globally defined killing spinor on @xmath5 .",
    "a central role is played by the reeb vector field = j(r)where @xmath6 denotes the complex structure tensor on the cone @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath7 is holomorphic , killing , and has constant norm on the link @xmath8 of the singularity at @xmath9 .",
    "if the orbits of @xmath7 all close then @xmath5 has a @xmath10 isometry , which necessarily acts locally freely , and the sasakian structure is said to be either regular or quasi ",
    "regular if this action is free or not , respectively .",
    "the orbit space is in general a positively curved khler ",
    "einstein orbifold @xmath11 , which is a smooth manifold in the regular case .",
    "more generally , the generic orbits of @xmath7 need not close , in which case the sasakian structure is said to be irregular .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence maps the symmetry generated by the reeb vector field to the r  symmetry of the dual cft .",
    "thus for the quasi  regular case the cft has a @xmath10 r  symmetry , whereas for the irregular case it has a non ",
    "compact @xmath12 r  symmetry .    given a sasaki  einstein manifold",
    "@xmath0 , the cone @xmath1 , as a complex variety , is an isolated gorenstein singularity .",
    "if @xmath13 denotes @xmath1 with the singular point removed , we have @xmath14 with @xmath15 a coordinate on @xmath16 . @xmath1",
    "being gorenstein means simply that there exists a nowhere zero holomorphic @xmath17form @xmath18 on @xmath13 .",
    "one may then turn things around and ask which isolated gorenstein singularities admit sasaki  einstein metrics on their links .",
    "this is a question in algebraic geometry , and it is an extremely difficult one . to give some idea of how difficult this question is , let us focus on the quasi  regular case . thus , suppose that @xmath1 has a holomorphic @xmath19 action , with orbit space being a fano to be a compact khler orbifold , such that the cohomology class of the ricci  form in @xmath20 is represented by a positive @xmath21form on @xmath22 . ]",
    "manifold , or fano orbifold , @xmath22",
    ". then existence of a ricci ",
    "flat khler cone metric on @xmath1 , with conical symmetry generated by @xmath23 , is well known to be equivalent to finding a khler ",
    "einstein metric on @xmath22  for a review , see @xcite .",
    "existence of khler ",
    "einstein metrics on fanos is a very subtle problem that is still unsolved .",
    "that is , a set of necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions on @xmath22 are not known in general .",
    "there are two well  known holomorphic obstructions , due to matsushima @xcite and futaki @xcite .",
    "the latter was related to sasakian geometry in @xcite and is not in fact an obstruction from the sasaki  einstein point view .",
    "specifically , it is possible to have a fano @xmath22 that has non  zero futaki invariant and thus does not admit a khler - einstein metric , but nevertheless the link of the total space of the canonical bundle over @xmath22 can admit a sasaki  einstein metric  the point is simply that the reeb vector field is not  the first del pezzo surface . in this case",
    "both the matsushima and futaki theorems obstruct existence of a khler ",
    "einstein metric on @xmath22 , but there is nevertheless an irregular sasaki  einstein metric on the link in the total space of the canonical bundle over @xmath22 @xcite . ] the one associated with the canonical bundle over @xmath22 . it is also known that vanishing of these two obstructions is , in general , insufficient for there to exist a khler ",
    "einstein metric on @xmath22 .",
    "it has been conjectured in @xcite that @xmath22 admits a khler ",
    "einstein metric if and only if it is _ stable _ ; proving this conjecture is currently a major research programme in geometry ",
    "see , for example , @xcite . thus , one also expects the existence of ricci  flat khler cone metrics on an isolated gorenstein singularity @xmath1 to be a subtle problem .",
    "this issue has been overlooked in some of the physics literature , and it has sometimes been incorrectly assumed , or stated , that such conical calabi ",
    "yau metrics exist on particular singularities , as we shall discuss later .",
    "the reeb vector field contains a significant amount of information about the metric . for a fixed @xmath14 , the reeb vector field @xmath7 for a sasaki  einstein metric on @xmath5 satisfies a variational problem that depends only on the complex structure of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this is the geometric analogue of @xmath24maximisation @xcite in four dimensional superconformal field theories .",
    "this allows one , in principle and often in practice , to obtain @xmath7 , and hence in particular the volume , of a sasaki  einstein metric on @xmath5  _ assuming that this metric exists_.    now , for any @xmath25dimensional einstein manifold @xmath0 with @xmath26 , bishop s theorem @xcite ( see also @xcite ) implies that the volume of @xmath5 is bounded from above by that of the round unit radius sphere .",
    "thus we are immediately led to what we will call the * bishop obstruction * to the existence of sasaki  einstein metrics :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if the volume of the putative sasaki  einstein manifold , calculated using the results of @xcite , is greater than that of the round sphere , then the metric can not exist .",

    "we will also discuss the ads / cft interpretation of this result .",
    "the reeb vector field @xmath7 also leads to a second possible obstruction .",
    "given @xmath7 for a putative sasaki ",
    "einstein metric , it is a simple matter to show that holomorphic functions @xmath27 on the corresponding cone @xmath1 with definite charge @xmath28 , _ f = i f give rise to eigenfunctions of the laplacian on the sasaki ",

    "it is a simple matter to perform @xmath24maximisation for this theory , taken at face value .",

    ", one can see this also from the sasakian perspective through the results of @xcite .",
    "the diagonal action with weights @xmath277 is clearly a critical point of the sasakian ",
    "hilbert action , and this critical point was shown to be unique in the space of toric sasakian metrics .",
    "nonetheless , in this subsection we show that lichnerowicz s bound and bishop s bound both obstruct existence of these metrics .",
    "the holomorphic @xmath17form on @xmath274 has charge @xmath278 under the weighted @xmath19 action , which implies that the correctly normalised reeb vector field is = with notation as before , so that @xmath81 is the vector field that generates @xmath172 .",

    "the problem of existence of conical ricci ",

    "we have presented two simple necessary conditions for existence of a ricci  flat khler cone metric on a given isolated gorenstein singularity @xmath1 with specified reeb vector field .",
    "the latter is in many ways similar to specifying a `` khler class '' , or polarisation .",
    "these necessary conditions are based on the classical results of bishop and lichnerowicz , that bound the volume and the smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian on einstien manifolds , respectively .",
    "the key point that allows us to use these as obstructions is that , in both cases , fixing a putative reeb vector field @xmath7 for the sasaki ",
    "einstein metric is sufficient to determine both the volume and the `` holomorphic '' eigenvalues using only the holomorphic data of @xmath1 .",
    "note that any such vector field @xmath7 must also be a critical point of the sasakian ",

    "einstein terms means that the transverse futaki invariant is zero .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the possible obstructions presented here may be analysed independently of this , the weighted projective spaces at the end of section [ section5 ] being examples that are obstructed by more than one obstruction .",
    "to demonstrate the utility of these criteria , we have provided many explicit examples of gorenstein singularities that _ do not _ admit sasaki ",
    "einstein metrics on their links , for a particular choice of reeb vector field .",
    "the examples include various quasi ",
    "homogeneous hypersurface singularities , previously studied in the physics literature , that have been erroneously assumed to admit such ricci  flat khler cone metrics .",

    "both bounds reduce to simple geometrical statements on the polyhedral cone @xmath287 and its associated semi ",

    "we have also explained the relevance of these bounds to the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "we have shown that the lichnerowicz bound is equivalent to the unitarity bound on the scaling dimensions of bps chiral operators of the dual field theories .",
    "in particular , we analysed a class of obstructed 3fold singularities , parameterised by a positive integer @xmath183 , for which , in the case that @xmath183 is even , the field theory dual is known and has been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "the fact that the links @xmath187 do not admit sasaki ",
    "einstein metrics for any @xmath269 supports the field theory arguments of @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to know whether a sasaki  einstein metric exists on @xmath224 ; if it does exist , it might be dual to an exotic type of field theory since the corresponding calabi  yau cone does not admit a crepant resolution .",
