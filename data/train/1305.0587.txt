    "procyon  a is the 14th nearest star and stellar system to the sun , according to henry ( 2011 ) , at a distance of 3.51 parsecs or 11.46 light years ",
    "see van leeuwen ( 2007 ) .",
    "its spectral type is f5  iv - v .",
    "bessel ( 1844 ) discovered that the ( large ) proper motion of procyon on the sky was perturbed by what he recognized to be an unseen companion .",
    "procyon  b was first detected visually at the end of the 19th century by schaeberle ( 1896 ) . the first recognition that the companion was like those in the sirius and 40  eri systems , later to be called white dwarfs , may be the work of the irish amateur astronomer john ellard gore .",
    "however , he did not properly publish this result in the astronomical literature  see the discussions of his work by fitzgerald ( 1966 ) and holberg ( 2009 ) .",
    "the first orbital elements were determined by auwers ( 1862 ) , who showed that the orbital period would be about 40 years .",
    "we now know that the more exact period is 40.838 years ( h. e. bond & g.h .",
    "schaefer , 2012 private communication ) .",
    "solar - like oscillations in procyon a were first reported by brown et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and several authors have since investigated the structure and evolution of that star through a seismic approach ( see , e.g. , dogan et al . 2010 and references therein ) .",
    "we come back to the asteroseismological properties of procyon a in   5 .    like sirius  a studied in liebert et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter paper  i ) , procyon  a has an extremely accurate interferometric radius measurement , and an extremely accurate trigonometric parallax ; the luminosity is also very accurate .",
    "sirius  a is certainly a main sequence star , while procyon  a could be entering or about to enter the subgiant branch .",
    "in contast to the sirius system , however , the astrometric mass solution for the procyon system has been a controversial issue , as we shall discuss in   2 .",
    "in comparison with the white dwarf sirius  b , procyon  b is very different from other ( mostly da ) white dwarfs previously used for the problem of the star s initial - to - final mass relation ( ifmr ) .",
    "mainly it has a helium - dominated atmosphere polluted by heavy elements ( dqz spectral type ) , a lower mass , and a cooler temperature .",
    "the mass , radius and @xmath5 determined for the b component will be discussed in   3 .    in   4 we address the atmospheric abundances of procyon  a and the interior abundances to be used for modelling in   5 .",
    "here we employ the tycho stellar evolution code ( young & arnett 2005 ) to fit the position of procyon  a in an hr diagram , and determine the age .    in ",
    "6 eleven calculations of the cooling time of procyon  b are presented , for different assumptions about the mass , the helium envelope mass , and its composition .",
    "the cooling time is the length of time since the degenerate entered the white dwarf sequence ; this has been used for the coolest white dwarfs to estimate ages of the galactic disk ( liebert , dahn , & monet 1988 ) and halo ( hansen et al .",
    "2007  using the globular cluster ngc  6397 ) .",
    "the difference between the systemic age and the white dwarf cooling time yields the best theoretical estimate of the initial mass of the white dwarf .",
    "moreover , as discussed in   6 , procyon  b presents a complicated case for the calculation of the cooling age .",
    "further remarks pertinent to this more challenging physical situation are discussed in that section .",
    "this paper adds a valuable new object with accurately determined stellar parameters ( masses , radii , luminosities ) to the initial - to - final mass relation ( ifmr ) for progenitors and white dwarfs .",
    "the vast majority of other data points have white dwarfs with hydrogen - rich atmospheres , while procyon b has a complicated helium - rich envelope and atmosphere .",
    "it is possible that the ifmr for helium - rich white dwarfs may differ from the hydrogen - rich distribution .",
    "we show in   7 how procyon  b compares with sirius  b and white dwarfs in star clusters for which the ifmr of low to intermediate mass stars has been determined .",
    "as noted in the introduction , a precise radius measurement is available for procyon  a , from measurements of the angular diameter with the eso very large telescope interferometer .",
    "the radius is @xmath6 = 2.031@xmath00.013@xmath7  or @xmath00.65% ( aufdenberg , ludwig , & kervella 2005 ) .",
    "this radius value is based on the authors `` best estimate '' angular diameter of 5.404@xmath00.031 mas at 2.2@xmath8 .",
    "note that the authors constructed model atmospheres for procyon in three ways : ( 1 ) stand - alone one - dimensional ( 1d ) phoenix structures , radiation fields , and spectra ( hauschildt et al . 1999 ) ; ( 2 ) co@xmath9bold 3d structures temporarily and spatially averaged to 1d , then read by phoenix for computation of the corresponding radiation fields ( freytag et al .",
    "2002 ) ; and ( 3 ) stand - alone 1d atlas  12 ( kurucz 1992 ) structures , radiation fields and spectra .",
    "note that the quantitative assessment of the limb darkening , on which the radius value is determined , depends on the model atmospheres analysis .",
    "the authors discuss in detail their assessment of these different models , leading to their `` best estimate '' .",
    "these authors also cite the earlier measurement on mt .",
    "wilson , california using the mark iii interferometer at 500 and 800  nm ( mozurkewich et al 1991 ) , whose limb - darkened value of the angular diameter ( 5.51@xmath00.05 mas ) agrees marginally within the errors .",
    "their new measurement compares to an older , slightly less accurate , but consistent value of 2.048@xmath00.025@xmath7   by the same group ( kervella et al .",
    "2004 ) , which corresponds to an adopted angular diameter of 5.448@xmath00.053 mas .",

    "( 2005 ) best value .",
    "note that the kervella et al . and aufdenberg et al .",
    "results differ by less than 1@xmath11 .",
    "adopting either one results in an essentially identical fit .",

    "estimate @xmath14 = 6591  k or 6556  k depending on how the bolometric flux is calculated , within the error bars of aufdenberg et al .",
    "the former value differs the most from aufdenberg et al.s preferred 6543  k , resulting in log @xmath12/@xmath13 = + 0.843 ( with one more significant digit than is warranted ) .",
    "the difference between these two values hardly matters in figure 1 .",
    "two decades ago the mass of the `` a '' component was believed to be near 1.75  @xmath3 ( irwin et al .",
    ". however , main sequence evolutionary models at that mass were too luminous by a factor of two compared with the observed luminosity ( guenter & demarque 1993 ) .",
    "long - term imaging by hst , combined with the interferometric radius and trigonometric parallax measurements cited above led to a great improvement in the stellar parameters .",
    "first , girard et al.(2000 ) produced an improved astrometric solution based on analysis of 250 photographic plates spanning 83 years , augmented with early hubble data .",
    "they found m@xmath15 = 1.497@xmath00.037 @xmath3 , almost exactly the 1.50 @xmath3 predicted by guenther & demarque ( 1993 ) .",
    "the problem is that hst imaging has only been possible for only about half of the orbital period .",
    "the combining of space - based imaging and the much longer series of ground - based observations has often been fraught with difficulties .",
    "apparent systematic offsets often occur in the respective measurements of the separations and position angles .",
    "girard et al . ( 2000 ) found that , if they restricted the astrometric analysis to the excellent images obtained with the wfpc2 camera ",
    "i.e. , with no ground - based data  a substantially lower mass ( 1.465 @xmath3 ) for procyon a was the result .",
    "at that time hst imagery covered only about a decade .",
    "allende prieto et al . ( 2002 ) revisited the procyon a solution using the _ hipparcos _ parallax and the stellar angular diameter by mozurkevich et al .",
    "( 1991 ) discussed previously .",
    "they derived the primary s mass to be a much lower 1.42@xmath00.06 @xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with the ground - based gatewood and han ( 2006 ) value of the primary s mass of 1.43@xmath00.034 @xmath3 , determined from their multichannel astrometric photometer * map * camera , built at the university of pittsburg ( gatewood 1987 ) .",
    "the * map * parallax is 286@xmath00.95 mas , which agrees well with the _ hipparcos _ value .",
    "schaefer et al . ( 2006 ) reported a preliminary solution resulting from a space telescope science institute - led program to extend the imaging program on the procyon binary orbit .",
    "their result was in excellent agreement with the girard et al .",
    "( 2000 ) analysis including ground - based data .",
    "several more years of hst data since 2006 now result in the following masses : 1.499@xmath00.031 @xmath3 for procyon  a and 0.553@xmath00.022 @xmath3 for procyon  b ( g. h. schaefer and h. e. bond , 2012 private communication ) .",
    "this solution uses available hst data from 1995 through 2012 plus , appropriately weighted , the archival ground - based data .",
    "it is not difficult to see how the total mass of the system is specified from accurate hst astrometry . using newton s gravitational formula for kepler s third law , ( @xmath16 + @xmath17 ) = @xmath18  /  @xmath19  @xmath20 , with the semimajor axis ( @xmath21 ) and period ( @xmath22 ) well known ,",
    "the sum of the masses is fixed at 2.052 @xmath3 .",
    "ground - based observations of the wobble of the a component about the center - of - mass on the sky then fix @xmath23 , @xmath23  +  @xmath24  =  @xmath21 , and @xmath16/@xmath17  =  @xmath24/@xmath23 .",
    "thus the solution provides separate values for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the mass determinations remain a matter of dispute in the literature .",
    "we begin with 1.499 @xmath3 as the hst - based , preferred mass of the primary for fitting in   5 .",

    "even early estimates of the mass ( @xmath17 ) of the white dwarf component , such as that by strand ( 1951 ) , showed that it is much closer to the mean value of field white dwarfs than is sirius  b. the updated schaefer et al .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the nature of the `` b '' white dwarf poses additional problems .",
    "the atmosphere is helium - rich , with trace abundances of carbon , calcium , magnesium and iron , but no detection of hydrogen .",
    "this is an unusually diverse abundance pattern for a white dwarf atmosphere , and complicated greatly the determination of the atmospheric parameters .",
    "not knowing of the complication , in the absence of an ultraviolet spectrum , provencal et al .",
    "( 1997 ) used pure hydrogen and helium atmospheres to model the spectral energy distribution . preferring the helium fit due to its optical `` dc '' spectrum",
    ", they found @xmath14 = 8,688  k. this implied a stellar radius of 0.0096@xmath00.0005 @xmath7 .",
    "given the mass , this small radius implied that the interior composition of the white dwarf could not be carbon - oxygen , but rather something very dense like iron ( shipman & provencal 1999 ) .",
    "this conclusion was unsettling to stellar theorists .",
    "once the complicated ultraviolet spectrum was revealed with the space telescope imaging spectrograph on the hubble space telescope , provencal et al .",
    "( 2002 ) got themselves out of this `` iron box '' .",
    "atmospheres with realistic trace adundances , obtained from fitting the spectrum and the 1,80010,000  spectral energy distribution were employed to obtain @xmath14 = 7,740@xmath050  k. they now estimated the radius to be 0.01234@xmath00.00032 @xmath7 , consistent with a carbon - oxygen interior .",
    "note that procyon  b is the only white dwarf in a binary system or star cluster which does not have an atmosphere amenable to a mass determination from either the fitting of hydrogen or he  i lines .",
    "it is also the coolest such white dwarf .",
    "there is a long literature trail indicating that the procyon  a atmospheric abundance can not be distinguished from solar .",
    "we cite five studies : heiter & luck ( 2003 ) , and luck & heiter ( 2005 ) , as part of a study of all bright , nearby stars in the northern hemisphere , analyzed procyon  a using high resolution spectra .",
    "they found an iron abundance [ fe / h ] = @xmath250.04@xmath00.06 .",
    "valenti & fischer ( 2005 ) , as part of a systematic study of nearby stars using echelle spectra , obtained [ fe / h ] = @xmath250.05@xmath00.03 . in allende prieto",
    "et al.s ( 2004 ) study of stars more luminous than m@xmath26 = + 6.5 within 14.5  pc of the sun , a value of + 0.08 was determined for procyon  a. finally , in the most comprehensive geneva - copenhagen study of solar neighborhood stars ( nordstrm et al .",
    "2004 ) , a value of [ fe / h ] = + 0.05 was reported .",
    "both of the last two author groups discuss the possible systematic error due to the coupling of the [ fe / h ] determination to the error in the log @xmath27 value .",
    "note that procyon  a is cool enough that peculiar diffusion / gravitational support mechanisms should not distort the surface abundances from the interior abundance .",
    "there could , nevertheless , be a small diffusion of heavy elements out of the thin convective envelope .    however , recently there has been controversy about what the solar abundance actually is .",
    "inevitably , the abundance parameters to be run for the stellar evolution models of procyon  a , to be described next in   5 , must therefore be linked to this controversy , so a few comments are in order .    the newer solar abundance scale determined from 3d , non - lte calculations of the solar atmosphere ( asplund et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 , 2009  the latter hereafter a09 ) , and now lodders 2010 ) have significantly lower abundances of oxygen , carbon and nitrogen than previous estimates ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) . the abundance of neon is a particular problem , since it is impossible to measure this element in the sun ( or procyon  a ) , but is likely to be comparable numerically to the three elements mentioned previously .",
    "the overall heavy element abundance parameter for the sun decreases to a primordial value of @xmath1=0.0153 .",
    "the asplund a09 scale has been challenged because it breaks the accordance of the `` standard solar '' interior model with helioseismological measurements ( bahcall et al .",
    "a solar model with these abundances incorrectly predicts the depth of the convection zone , the depth profiles of sound speed and density , and the helium abundance ( basu & antia 2004 ) . as a check on the magnitude of likely systematic errors due to uncertainty in the actual solar ( and",
    "procyon  a ) abundance , we retain consideration of the older grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) solar abundance which corresponds to @xmath1=0.019 .",
    "the tycho code  http://chandra.as.arizona.edu/@xmath28dave/tycho-intro.html  incorporates the most current microphysics for opacities , equation - of - state , and nuclear reactions . in particular , the code has been upgraded with an algorithm based on a physical analysis of 3d hydrodynamic simulations of convection , not an astronomically - calibrated version of the mixing length theory .",
    "it includes non - locality and time dependence of flow , dynamical acceleration , turbulent dissipation , kolmogorov heating , compositional effects and dynamically - defined boundary conditions ( instead of parameterized overshooting schemes ) , all in a single , self - consistent formulation .",
    "the code is regularly tested against observations of double - lined eclipsing binaries and cluster isochrones to ensure consistency and accuracy .",
    "it produces superior fits to observational test cases without adjustment of parameters .",
    "these changes make possible fits to nuclear - burning stars on the hr diagram , especially those on or near the main sequence ( arnett , meakin , & young 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "robust , consistent ages for ( nondegenerate ) binary stars with well - determined luminosities , masses , radii and temperatures have been determined by young et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , young & arnett ( 2005 ) .    in additon to the mass",
    ", we have to input the abundance parameters @xmath29 and @xmath1 , where @xmath1 scales by the solar ratios of individual elements .",
    "since we can not regard the solar atmospheric abundance issue as fully resolved , we therefore have computed sequences using the lodders ( 2010 ) value of @xmath1 = 0.0153 and also evaluated the older solar abundance of grevesse and sauval ( 1988 ) which imply @xmath1 = 0.019 .    in figure  1",
    "we show evolutionary tracks for @xmath1 = 0.0153 of ( 1 ) 1.499 @xmath3 ( in black ) , the best value from preliminary hst astrometry (   2 ) , fitting the correct luminosity and radius at age 1.74  gyr ; ( 2 ) 1.48 @xmath3 ( red ) at 1.87  gyr , the best fit to the luminosity ( to three significant digits ) ; ( 3 ) 1.463 @xmath3 ( green ) at 1.99  gyr ; and ( 4 ) the lower 1.42 @xmath3 ( blue ) at 2.51  gyr favored by largely ground - based studies cited in   2 .",
    "the highest three masses fit within 1@xmath4 late on the main sequence . for 1.42",
    "@xmath3 the fit misses by more than 2@xmath4 late on the main sequence .",
    "note that best - fit ages include the pre - ms evolution , without pre - ms accretion , but only the tracks from the beginning of the main sequence are shown here .",
    "we also tried a fit with the grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) @xmath1 = 0.019 abundance at 1.48 @xmath3 , but it is 1.45@xmath4 underluminous when it reaches the correct radius on the main sequence at age 1.96  gyr . given the evidence from a09 and lodders ( 2010 ) that this solar metallicity value is too large , this marginal attempt at a fit is not shown in the figure .",
    "we therefore believe that 1.87@xmath00.13  gyr from the 1.48 @xmath3 fit is the best estimate of the age of the binary system , with the uncertainty given by the bracketing age values for the 1.499 and 1.463 @xmath3 fits .",
    "note that provencal et al .",
    "( 2002 ) estimated the nuclear lifetime of 1.3  gyr for component b , estimating @xmath282.1 @xmath3 as its progenitor mass .",

    "we now explore a range of alternative compositions for the white dwarf in   6 .",
    "since our best - fit mass using the tycho models lies well within the error bars of the preliminary hst astrometric mass of 1.499 @xmath3 , we adopt 1.48 @xmath3 as the preferred or `` benchmark '' mass of procyon  a.    note that the fitting of a star with mass near 1.5 @xmath3 at this stage of evolution presents uncertainties due to having both a small convective core and a small convective envelope . due to the former",
    ", the main sequence lifetime is affected by the uncertainty in the amount of hydrogen fuel available for reactions in the core .",
    "note that remaining uncertainties in the treatment of mixing beyond the convective core boundary , in the primordial solar abundance mix , or in any of the other model physics probably add larger systematic errors , by amounts which are difficult to quantify .",
    "the convective envelope leads to implied small differences between the interior and atmospheric @xmath1 abundances , as noted earlier .",
    "for kervella et al.s ( 2004 ) similar analysis , the fit to the hrd parameters also occurs in a similar way .",

    "we feel more comfortable assuming quadruple the formal @xmath14 error or @xmath0200  k.    there have unfortunately been a shortage of available evolutionary sequences for white dwarfs lacking thick hydrogen envelopes .",
    "most cluster white dwarf studies in the last few decades have used the evolutionary models of wood ( 1992 , 1995 ) , but always with an outer hydrogen layer .",
    "these calculations do include one sequence with no hydrogen , a `` thin '' helium envelope of 10@xmath32 , atop a pure carbon core but with solar abundances of elements heavier than helium ( wood 2012 , private communication ) .",
    "hansen ( 1999 ) showed that pure helium envelope cooling models for 0.6 @xmath3 by himself ( for c , o and c / o cores ) and by salaris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) cool considerably faster than the wood sequence ( see hansen s fig .  7 ) .",
    "note that if a trace of heavy elements were assumed , the envelope opacity would be considerably increased .",
    "hence , there has been some confusion as to what the cooling rates of white dwarfs lacking hydrogen layers should be .",
    "this issue is addressed in   6.2 .",
    "for a cool , non - da white dwarf with a simple , featureless spectrum , one could argue that the use of a pure - he envelope sequence such as from hansen ( 1999 ) would yield the more robust cooling time .",
    "however , the spectrum of procyon  b shows the effects of ( 1 ) dredge - up of carbon from the diffusion tail of the core , with an atmospheric abundance log  [ c / he ]  = @xmath255.5@xmath00.2 ( provencal et al .",

    "thus , a core composition dominated by oxygen , or at least a mixture of carbon and oxygen , is more likely than one of pure carbon for procyon  b. sequences have been calculated for pure oxygen , pure carbon , and for mixtures of carbon and oxygen according to the mass - dependent and depth - dependent results of salaris et al .",
    "we pick the last of these three types of sequences as the benchmark core composition .",
    "the cooling time also depends on the thickness of the helium layer .",
    "the helium - rich atmospheric composition indicates that some of the helium layer mass could have been lost in a late helium - shell flash that disposed of all of the hydrogen ( iben 1984 ) .",
    "values in the literature that have been considered include masses between 10@xmath41 and 10@xmath42 .",
    "the atmospheric carbon abundance is a strong constraint , since this results from dredgeup of the diffusion tail of carbon from the core .",
    "the study ( fontaine & brassard 2005 ) fitting dredgeup models to match the spectra of procyon  b and a sequence of field dq white dwarfs by dufour , bergeron , & fontaine ( 2005 ) shows that the atmospheric carbon abundance of procyon  b favors a layer mass thickness of log  @xmath43@xmath252.5@xmath00.5 ( see their fig .",
    "we therefore consider this value as the benchmark , with sequences also calculated for a reasonable range of @xmath252.0 and @xmath253.0 .",
    "finally , it is very difficult to estimate the opacities due to elements heavier than helium in the partially - degenerate helium layer .",
    "this will depend on how deeply the heavy elements have diffused into the envelope below the convection zone . in principle",
    "the carbon abundance profile can be calculated for the helium envelope from diffusion theory , with the atmospheric abundance as a surface boundary . to consider this dependence in an approximate way ,",
    "sequences with @xmath1=0.001 and @xmath1=0 have been calculated , with the former as the benchmark while the latter is contradicted by the observation of carbon and heavier elements in the spectrum .    in table 1 , the cooling ages for the parameters of procyon  b are listed for 8 sequences at the favored mass of 0.553 @xmath3 , two for values at @xmath00.022@xmath3 , and one for the alternative 0.602 @xmath3 ( girard et al .",
    "also listed for each sequence are the core composition ( c , o , or a more realistic salaris c / o mix ) , the helium layer mass ( @xmath252.5@xmath00.5 as discussed earlier ) , and the heavy element abundance @xmath1=0.001 or 0 .",
    "all assume zero hydrogen abundance .",
    "the benchmark cooling age of procyon  b is given by the model for 0.553 @xmath3 , with c / o core , log  m(he)/m = @xmath252.5 , and @xmath1 = 0.001 in the envelope ( benchmark parameters ) .",
    "the cooling value is 1.187  gyr , with a formal , internal error of @xmath00.104  gyr due to uncertainties in the assumed effective temperature and the assumed mass . according to table 1",
    ", a range of @xmath0200 k about the estimated effective temperature of @xmath14 = 7740 k translates into an age uncertainty of @xmath00.085 gyr , while a range of @xmath00.022 @xmath3 about the benchmark mass of 0.533 @xmath3 translates into an age interval of @xmath00.061 gyr .",
    "added in quadrature , these uncertainties lead to @xmath00.104 gyr .",
    "in addition , two sources of systematic error should be considered here .",
    "the age difference between a mixed ( c / o ) and a pure oxygen core is relatively small at 0.010  gyr .",
    "for its part , uncertainty due to variations in the helium layer mass is @xmath00.043  gyr .",
    "added again in quadrature with the above internal error , these systematic effects lead to a total uncertainty of @xmath00.113 gyr on the age .",
    "so we reach the value of 1.19@xmath00.11  gyr for the white dwarf cooling time of procyon b.    on the other hand , the @xmath1 = 0 envelope sequence with otherwise benchmark assumptions yields a considerably larger age of 1.391  gyr . since this is inconsistent with ultraviolet observations of carbon and heavy elements in the ultraviolet spectrum , we consider a metal - free envelope an unrealistic assumption .",
    "note that the atmospheric values determined by provencal et al .",
    "( 2002 ) already have a heavy element abundance ( dominated by carbon ) of z@xmath280.00001 .",
    "this parameter increases greatly below the convection zone throughout the partially - degenerate helium envelope ( following profile of carbon dredge - up ) , until it reaches the c / o core .",
    "likewise , we do not consider the assumption of a pure carbon core realistic .",
    "the combination of a pure carbon core with zero metallicity envelope yields an even larger cooling age of 1.557  gyr .",
    "the cooling age listed for the alternative mass of 0.602 @xmath3 , assuming benchmark values of the other parameters above , is 1.406  gyr . a mass this large for the secondary disagrees by more than 2@xmath4 from that derived from hst astrometry and we no longer consider it in the rest of this paper .",
    "these several possibilities in this paragraph are not factored into the error bars in the preceding paragraph .",
    "the difference between the age of the procyon system and the cooling time of the white dwarf component , 0.68@xmath00.17 gyr , corresponds to the sum of the pre - main sequence lifetime and the main sequence lifetime ( plus the much shorter red giant phases ) of the procyon b progenitor . using again our tycho evolutionary code",
    ", we thus find that the initial mass ( @xmath44 ) of the secondary is 2.59@xmath45 @xmath3 , if the envelope z value is fixed at 0.001 .",
    "however , if one allows for the extreme upper limit to the cooling time from the assumption of z(env ) = 0 , the error bars for the progenitor mass increase to @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the quoted errors on @xmath44 are the quadrature sums of @xmath250.21,+0.40 due to the incertainty in the cooling time of the white dwarf , and @xmath250.16,+0.20 due to systematic error in the age of the binary system ( table  2 ) . in figure  2 ,",
    "discussed in detail in the next section , the solid horizontal error bars for procyon  b are for the case of z(env ) fixed at 0.001 , the extended light error bars reflect the increase in cooling time for the limiting case z(env ) = 0",
    ".      it may be worthwhile at this point to attract the attention of the reader on some subtleties of white dwarf cooling which leave their signature on the data presented in table 1 .",
    "for instance , as is well known ( and revealed again in the table ) , pure c core models systematically cool slower than models having cores made of heavier elements , all other things being the same . that a pure carbon core takes longer to cool",
    "is well understood , because the thermal energy in a given mass is locked up in more nucleons than for pure oxygen or a mixture . however , that the @xmath1 = 0 envelope takes longer to cool than one with heavy elements is not so intuitive , because one might think that the more opaque envelope with heavy elements would let the interior energy out more slowly .",
    "our calculations show that cooling proceeds in two phases . at first",
    "the less opaque model does let the thermal energy escape more quickly , and core temperature decreases more rapidly . despite this",
    ", however , the decrease in luminosity has to be slower for the less opaque model because of that extra energy that is made available to fuel the luminosity .",
    "hence , in a first phase , the less opaque model actually cools _ more slowly _ to a given luminosity or @xmath14 .",
    "however then , after the less opaque star has let more of its thermal energy escape , there is no turning back and the price to pay , in a second phase , is that it will now cool _",
    "faster _ the rest of the way than its more opaque counterpart . in the case of procyon",
    "b at @xmath14 = 7,740  k , it is still warm emough to be in the first phase of that `` relative '' cooling and , hence , this is why the cooling age is larger for the less opaque model . if the star had a @xmath14 of @xmath285,000  k , then indeed the cooling age based on the less opaque envelope sequence would be shorter than than of the more opaque , as the conventional wisdom would expect .",
    "these arguments may be discerned from a careful perusal of section iii(a ) , subsection ( ii ) of tassoul , fontaine and winget ( 1990 ) , although this discussion compares an opaque envelope of hydrogen with less opaque counterparts .",
    "as discussed in the last paragraph of the introduction , the initial - to - final mass relation ( ifmr ) for progenitors and white dwarfs is fundamental in understanding a stellar population .",
    "this study of procyon adds a data point near the low mass end with well determined stellar parameters ; it may be valuable for testing whether differences exist in the ifmr for the distributions of hydrogen and helium - rich atmosphere white dwarfs .",
    "table  2 lists final ( @xmath46 ) and initial ( @xmath44 ) masses in @xmath3 , cooling times ( log in years ) , and estimated errors , first for procyon  b and sirius  b. the remaining data points come from white dwarfs found in galactic star clusters , in order of increasing age ( see footnotes ) .",
    "the collective data set is shown in figure  2 .",
    "again , the age of the population is obtained generally from fitting the main sequence turnoff of the cluster color - magnitude diagram .    as given in ferrario et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the errors in @xmath44 fall into two categories  observational ( obs ) or random , and systematic ( sys ) , as listed in table  2 .",
    "the observational errors devolve from uncertainties in the @xmath46 from fitting the balmer lines ( or , in one case , he  i lines ) ; the systematic errors come from uncertainties in the cluster or binary system age .",
    "since the nuclear lifetime of the progenitor is the difference between the systemic age and the white dwarf cooling time , @xmath44 depends on the age as well .",
    "note that the uncertainties in the age determinations for the young clusters lead to large error bars in the estimates of the initial masses @xmath44 .    we add gd  50 to the pleiades `` moving group '' , since dobbie et al .",
    "( 2006 ) make a strong case based on astrometric and spectroscopic data that this ultramassive white dwarf is associated with the star formation event that created the pleiades cluster .",
    "they argue that it evolved as a single star from a progenitor of 6.3 @xmath3 , and that this may represent the first observational evidence that single - star evolution can produce white dwarfs with , in this case , a mass of 1.27 @xmath3 ( bergeron , saffer , & liebert 1992 ) or 1.2(+0.07,@xmath250.08 ) @xmath3 ( bergeron et al .",
    "they make a weaker case that the massive white dwarf pg  0136 + 251 , 1.20@xmath00.03 @xmath3 ( bergeron , saffer , & liebert 1992 ) , may also be related to the pleiades .",
    "however , information is lacking on the total ( @xmath47 ) space motion of this object , so we do not include it here .",
    "we adopt an age of 125@xmath025  myr for the pleiades , which depends on the treatment of the convective core .",
    "this excludes a systematic uncertainty to the age which will be true for all clusters with main sequence turnoff stars of mass above @xmath28  1.3 @xmath3 .",

    "<S> the procyon  ab binary system ( orbital period 40.838 years , a newly - refined determination ) , is near and bright enough that the component radii , effective temperatures and luminosities are very well determined , although more than one possible solution to the masses has limited the claimed accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary mass determinations for each component are available from hst imaging , supported by ground - based astrometry and an excellent _ hipparcos _ parallax ; we use these for our preferred solution for the binary system . </S>",
    "<S> other values for the masses are also considered . </S>",
    "<S> we have employed the tycho stellar evolution code to match the radius and luminosity of the f5  iv - v primary star to determine the system s most likely age as 1.87@xmath00.13  gyr . since prior studies of procyon  a found its abundance indistinguishable from solar , the solar composition of asplund , grevesse & sauval ( @xmath1=0.014 ) is assumed for the hr diagram fitting . an unsuccessful attempt to fit using the older solar abundance scale of grevesse & sauval ( @xmath1=0.019 ) is also reported . </S>",
    "<S> for procyon  b , eleven new sequences for the cooling of non - da white dwarfs have been calculated , to investigate the dependences of the cooling age on ( 1 ) the mass , ( 2 ) the core composition , ( 3 ) the helium layer mass , and ( 4 ) heavy - element opacities in the helium envelope . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations indicate a cooling age of 1.19@xmath00.11 gyr , which implies that the progenitor mass of procyon  b was 2.59@xmath2 @xmath3 . in a plot of initial vs final mass of white dwarfs in astrometric binaries or star clusters ( all with age determinations ) , the procyon  b final mass lies several @xmath4 below a straight line fit . </S>"
