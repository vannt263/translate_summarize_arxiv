    "<S> we propose a method to investigate modular structure in networks based on fitted probabilistic model , where the connection probability between nodes is related to a set of introduced local attributes . </S>",
    "<S> the attributes , as parameters of the empirical model , can be estimated by maximizing the likelihood function of the observed network . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the distribution of attributes provides an informative visulization of modular networks on low - dimensional space , and suggest the attribute space can be served as a better platform for further network analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> networks are widely used to model complex systems with many interactive units@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> usually , each node in such a network represents a distinct individual , and a link is established based on certain measurement of interaction between particular pair of nodes . on the microscopic level , </S>",
    "<S> the underlying system is fully described by state of each unit defined by several local properties , which also determines the interactions among them through complicated coupling . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the network would be completely determined if local properties of nodes and interactive functions were known . in many applications however , the representative network is the only available data . </S>",
    "<S> it is the purpose of the researchers to infer these crutial information on the underlying system through network analysis . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if the interaction between two units mainly depends on their local properties , then it is reasonable to expect that the units which have similar connection patterns in network representation , will share some common features in their local properties , and therefore may have similar functioning in the underlying system . </S>",
    "<S> although very friutful , the applicability of this type of analysis is limited by the gap existing between the network - level description and the underlying system . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that in most situations , the representitive network only models relationships or interactions among units , but not the associated properties or states of units which determine interactions . </S>",
    "<S> so for example , a minor change on the observed network may not be caused necessarily by small perturbations on local properties of units in the underlying system , since interactions may depend on local states in a highly nonlinear way . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the evolution of the unerlying system due to continuous change of local states may result in abrupt changes on the network structure , such as group merge or split .    </S>",
    "<S> to better deal with these problems , a necessary step is to bridge these two deffierent description levels . </S>",
    "<S> however it is generally impossible to completely reconstruct the intrinsic properties of nodes based solely on the strucure of a given network , since the mechanism determining a link may be very complicated . in this paper , we develope a method to describe the system in a middle level between the representitive network and the microscopic description through some simplifications . </S>",
    "<S> we regard the representitive network as one particular realization of an emprical probabilistic model . in this model </S>",
    "<S> , each pair of nodes has certain probability to be connected , and the connection probabilities depends on the distance between local attributes of the corresponding nodes through some function . </S>",
    "<S> the attributes , act as model parameters , can be estimated according to some statistical criterion to best interpret the observed connections . since each data point in the space of attributes </S>",
    "<S> is associated with distinct node , their configuration provides an alternative representation of the observed network .    </S>",
    "<S> the advantages of introducing this new representation are twofolds . on the one hand </S>",
    "<S> , the configuration of the attributes provides an informative projection of the network on a low - dimensional space . </S>",
    "<S> the established attribute space can be taken as new platform for further network analysis , where the attribute vectors which have no difference with conventional data source , allow many well developed clustering techniques to be applied directly . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the introduced local attributes are closely related to the unknown properties of the unerlying system by the common observed network . </S>",
    "<S> it may be easier to model evolution of the underlying system as changes of attributes , and study the final influences on network structure through the empiral probability model .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we mainly focus on studying modular strucutres in networks . after describing technique details of modeling approach </S>",
    "<S> , we apply the proposed method to some artificial and real - world networks to demonstrate its usefulness on network visualzing and structure analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss a possible way to extend the proposed technique to deal with more complicated multi - layered modular network .    </S>",
    "<S> assume there is an imaginary probabilistic system with @xmath0 nodes , which is characterized by a connection probability matrix @xmath1 , where @xmath2 represents the probability of connection between node @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the given network described by adjancency matrix @xmath5 is regarded as a realization of this imaginary system . in particular , @xmath6 is treated as a random variable and its observed value is determined by a bernoulli trial according to the probability @xmath2 . for each node in the imaginary system </S>",
    "<S> , there associates a set of local attributes denoted by @xmath7 , where the dimension @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the connection probability @xmath2 is then assumed to depend only on the local attributes @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and can be written as @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , this is a great simplication , and should be regarded as first order approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath12 tying connection probability @xmath2 and local attributes @xmath9 and @xmath10 should be chosen depending on the problem at hand . in our study </S>",
    "<S> , we are mainly interested in undirectional unweighted modular networks . considering the symmetric constraint , </S>",
    "<S> we choose a function @xmath12 which depends only on the distance @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 will be closed to @xmath15 when @xmath16 approaching to zeros , and decays rapidly with increasing @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> a natrual choise of @xmath12 is in guassian form : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , defined as @xmath19 is used as a rescaling factor to compensate the distortion when projecting the high dimensional network into a low - dimensional euclidian space due to the inhomogeneity of the degree distribution of the network . </S>",
    "<S> the connection probability thus becomes @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have @xmath21 under this framework , the logarithmic likelihood function of observing particular network @xmath22 is @xmath23 and @xmath24 naturally , attributes @xmath25 which maximize above likelihood function are desired . </S>",
    "<S> these maximum likelihood estimates can be obtained by minimizing @xmath26 following steps below :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> starting from arbitary initials @xmath27 , 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> caculate the derivatives @xmath28 , 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> search in this direction to get @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 gives smallest @xmath26 , 4 .   </S>",
    "<S> set @xmath31 , and go back to step 2 . </S>",
    "<S> 5 .   </S>",
    "<S> quit if stopping conditions are met .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noded that the explicitly casted functional relationship of attributes and connection probabilities may not be the true undelrying mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this approach nevertheless , can be applied as a useful technique to explore the desired structure in the network , providing the fitted model is good .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     c + ( c )    c + ( a ) +   + ( b ) +    [ fig : fig7 ]    american college football teams network has many clusters involved . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted model nevertheless successfully capture this complicated structure . </S>",
    "<S> the amazing representation of the network in atribute space ( shown in figure 5(a ) ) not only manifests clustering structures , but also suggests that several wandering points may not be clearly classfied . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that these nodes belongs to specific group ( ia independents ) and can not be classifed as one cluster consistently . furthermore , the particular node in the group of conference usa which is classifed as member of the group of western athletic is not due to the flaw of the method but caused by the network construction@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the attributes representation also suggests some groups may be further divided into smaller subgroups such as the mid american group . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is well supported by the connection patterns of nodes in this group . </S>",
    "<S> these useful information can not be easily obtained by conventional network clustering algorithms , and show the advantages of the proposed modeling approach .    </S>",
    "<S> the dolphins social network is another widely studied example . </S>",
    "<S> it can be divided into two big clusters . </S>",
    "<S> one of the cluster may be further divided into three small group as studied in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis results for dolphins social network are shown in figure 6 . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the attributes correctly reflects @xmath32 large clusters ( as shown in figure 6(b ) ) , but also indicates that there may exists @xmath32 or @xmath33 smaller clusters in the left cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the interesting observation is that the attributes of the nodes corresponding to three small clusters suggested in @xcite are indeed well grouped . also , the surrogate network generated by the fitted model ( as shown in figure 6(c ) ) shows striking similarity with the observed network .    </S>",
    "<S> decaying behaviors of fitting errors when the optimization procedure iterated unveil some common feature , which can be seen from the subplots ( upper right ones ) in all examples studied as shown in figure 4(c ) , figure 5(c ) and figure 6(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> it can be divided into two segments , a rapid decrease phase and a gradual change phase . after closely monitoring the movement of the points in attribute space step by step , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the points are always firstly arranged according to globe structure of the network , and then fine adjusted within each cluster to generate better configuration . </S>",
    "<S> this may partially explained why the suboptimal solutions due to gradient based algorithm also give out good configuration in general .    </S>",
    "<S> although modular structures are most commonly observed and studied , there are many different other structures . in our study </S>",
    "<S> , we choose gaussian function to relate local attributes to connection probability , which is particular useful to capture clustering structure . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed modeling approach nevertheless is flexible enough to deal with other structures providing they can be well defined . for example , for a bipartite network , the function @xmath34 , where @xmath12 is similar to what used in the paper , may be a better choise .    </S>",
    "<S> the proposed modeling approach can be easily extended to deal with more complicated grouping structure than simple modular structure . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a simple exention of overlapping two clustering structure . </S>",
    "<S> for example , consider a group of students who make friends based on different factors such as personality or avocation . now </S>",
    "<S> even if each friendship network based on any single factor were well clustered , the observed overall network may have structure quite different from the simple modular network . </S>",
    "<S> we call this kind of network multi - layered modular network . </S>",
    "<S> one such example of @xmath32-layered network is shown in figure 7(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this particular network is generated by the following way . </S>",
    "<S> suppose the nodes are numbered from @xmath15 to @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we first generate two modular networks separately . </S>",
    "<S> the first modular network has two clusters , one containing node @xmath15 to node @xmath36 and the other containing node @xmath37 to node @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the connection probabilities are @xmath38 for nodes in same cluster and @xmath39 in different clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the second modular network also has two clusters , one containing node @xmath40 to node @xmath41 , and the other containing nodes @xmath15 to @xmath42 and nodes @xmath43 to @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the connection probabilities are slightly different , which are @xmath44 for nodes in same cluster and @xmath45 for nodes in different clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the final network is generated by stacking two modular networks together , and removing repeated links . </S>",
    "<S> to explore such multi - layered structure by the proposed modeling approach , the most straight way is to extend the dimension of the attributes vector . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath46^t$ ] the new extended attributes . </S>",
    "<S> for each layer , the connection probability can be written as @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the connection probability of the observed network will be @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> following the same procedure described above , we get the attributes representation in extended attribute space . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the attributes are shown in figure 7(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the hidden clustering structure are unveiled in different subspace of the extended attribute space .    in summary , we proposed a probabilistic modeling approach to analyze networks . under this framework </S>",
    "<S> , the observed network can be regarded as a measurement of certain probabilistic system , where the connection probability of any pair of nodes depends on the properly rescaled distance between the introduced local attributes of the corresponding nodes . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that the configuration of the optimally estimated attributes well represents the intrinsic structure of the observed network , thus provides an very informative way to visualize networks in low - dimensional space </S>",
    "<S> . it can be more effective to make further network structure analysis based on the attribute vectors instead of observed network directly . </S>",
    "<S> the modeling approach can be easily extended to deal with more complicated structures such as multi - layered clustered network . </S>"
