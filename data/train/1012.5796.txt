    "the function @xmath3 is @xmath19 ; the only issue arises at @xmath244 , by parametrizing @xmath4 near @xmath245 by @xmath246 , we notice that on @xmath4 near @xmath245 , @xmath3 is given by @xmath247 .",
    "it is also not hard to see that @xmath248 .",
    "this is because for a fixed @xmath109 , being constant is the largest that @xmath25 can be and @xmath25 is the largest convex extension .",
    "but that means that the derivative of @xmath25 goes to infinity when we approach @xmath244 from the inside of the disc , and hence @xmath25 is not lipschitz on @xmath2 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : potatochip ] .",
    "on @xmath249.[fig : potatochip ] ]    as @xmath25 is the largest convex extension , it is not hard to see that any other convex extension of @xmath3 is also not lipschitz ( the derivative must also blow up at @xmath244 ) .",
    "[ example : noc2 ] it is rather surprising that even if @xmath3 is @xmath19 on the boundary , the convex roof need not be @xmath41 on the interior ( though it must be @xmath5 ) .",
    "let @xmath250 .",
    "let @xmath18 be defined by @xmath251 .",
    "obviously @xmath3 is @xmath19 ( in fact real - analytic ) on @xmath4 . by theorem  [ thm : reg ] @xmath252 .",
    "we now note that on the convex hull of the points @xmath245 , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 , the convex roof @xmath25 must be identically zero . on the other hand , by a similar argument as above , for @xmath255",
    ", we have @xmath256 .",
    "this means that for example on the line @xmath257 , the function @xmath25 is identically zero for @xmath258 and @xmath251 for @xmath255 . therefore @xmath25 is not @xmath41 at the origin ( and in fact along the line @xmath259 ) .",
    "the convex roof extension was introduced by uhlmann  @xcite as a way of defining a different measure of entanglement on the set of density operators .    given a quantum system there is associated to it a complex hilbert space @xmath260 so that all the possible states of that quantum system are in 1 - 1 correspondence with the set of 1-dimensional subspaces of @xmath260 , that is , the projective space @xmath261 . by assigning the orthogonal projection onto a 1-dimensional subspace",
    "we obtain a bijection between such orthogonal projectors and @xmath261 . in particular",
    "if @xmath262 is such a projector it has trace 1 .",
    "mixed states of a quantum system are probabilistic averages of pure states .",
    "the mixed states of a quantum system are in 1 - 1 correspondence with the set of positive semidefinite operators on @xmath260 of trace @xmath263 .",
    "this set is a compact convex subset with nonempty interior of the set of hermitian operators of trace @xmath263 , which in turn is an affine subspace of the set of complex linear operators on @xmath260 .",
    "any positive semidefinite operator of trace 1 is a convex combination of projectors of rank 1 .",
    "hence the set extreme points of the convex set of states ( the mixed states ) consists of the orthogonal projectors of rank @xmath263 , the so - called pure states .",
    "note also that for any positive semidefinite operator @xmath262 of trace 1 we have the inequality @xmath264 with equality if and only if @xmath262 is a projector of rank 1 .",
    "therefore the pure states are the relative boundary of the set of all states .",
    "the set of pure states can be identified with the set of nonzero vectors in @xmath260 modulo multiplication by nonzero complex scalars .",
    "suppose that @xmath260 is a tensor product of two hilbert spaces @xmath265 , @xmath266 , @xmath267 a pure state given by the vector @xmath268 is called a product state ( or unentangled ) if @xmath268 is a tensor product of two vectors @xmath269 @xmath270 this decomposition does not depend on the representative chosen ; a vector is a tensor product then any multiple of it is again a tensor product .",
    "we call a pure state entangled if ( any ) representative vector is _ not _ a tensor product .",
    "we consider functions defined on the set of pure states that are zero on the set of unentangled states and larger than zero on the set of entangled states .",
    "this is called a measure of entanglement .",
    "the question posed by uhlmann is as follows : how to extend a measure of entanglement from pure states to mixed states ?",
    "in other words , how to extend a function from the ( relative ) boundary of the set of states to the whole set .",
    "the method proposed is the convex roof construction .",
    "let us analyse a bit the common structure for these measures of entanglement .",
    "recall ( also see  @xcite ) that for every vector @xmath268 there exists an integer @xmath63 , strictly positive numbers @xmath271 , and orthonormal systems @xmath272 ,  ,",
    "@xmath273 in @xmath274 and @xmath275 ,  ,",
    "@xmath276 in @xmath277 such that @xmath278 the integer @xmath279 and the @xmath280 are uniquely determined .",
    "the vector @xmath268 is a tensor product if and only if @xmath281 .",
    "assuming @xmath282 we can measure how `` far '' is @xmath279 from @xmath263 by , for example , considering a function @xmath283 with some extra properties ( @xmath284 , @xmath285 , etc  )  and then defining @xmath286 , or a function of this sum .",
    "for example , the linear entropy is defined by @xmath287    the function @xmath3 is zero if and only if exactly one of the numbers @xmath288 is @xmath263 .",
    "one also notices that @xmath3 is continuous . in the case when @xmath265 and @xmath266 are both of dimension @xmath289",
    ", there exists a closed formula for the convex roof extension of the linear entropy due to wootters  @xcite .",
    "note that such a closed formula also describes the set of separable mixed states , that is , mixed states that are convex combination of pure product states .",
    "however , in the study of measures of entanglement there is an acute lack of explicit formulas for the convex roof extensions .",
    "a consequence of our results is that even if explicit formulas are unknown , still one concludes that all the measures of entanglements defined using the convex roof construction are continuous if the measure is continuous on the set of pure states ."
