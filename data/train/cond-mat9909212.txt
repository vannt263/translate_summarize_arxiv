    "the superconducting order parameter ( op ) in high - t@xmath1 cuprates , like yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( ybco ) is known to be mainly of @xmath5 symmetry in the bulk . due to the sign change of the op , andreev bound states develop on [ 110 ] surfaces@xcite .",
    "those abs carry current at zero energy and therefore should couple to the josephson current in superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) junctions , leading to a variety of novel and interesting features predicted by theories@xcite , but never observed experimentally to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we report on studies on ybco / pb tunnel junctions , made _ in - situ _ to avoid interface contamination@xcite .",
    "all the junctions display a clear hysteretic behavior ( inset fig.[fig1 ] ) , with a well defined quasi - particle ( qp ) branch and a josephson current i@xmath1 .",
    "we report here on junctions along the [ 110 ] and [ 103 ] directions , the later being almost equivalent to the [ 100 ] one .",
    "ybco films are grown by a reactive codeposition technique .",
    "metallic vapors are condensed on a [ 110 ]  srtio@xmath3 single crystal held at high temperature in an atmosphere of oxygen ( @xmath6 torrs ) , to make a 75  nm thick film in a rectangular shape .",
    "the optimal substrate temperature is 750@xmath7c to grow [ 103 ] oriented films .",
    "a 15  nm thick prba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath8 template layer is deposited at 630@xmath7c , prior to the ybco layer made at 750@xmath7c to grow [ 110 ] oriented films .",
    "the deposition chamber is then filled with pure oxygen while the temperature is decreased to room - temperature .",
    "finaly , after vaccum it again , 60  nm thick ag contact pads and 250  nm thick pb counter - electrodes are cross deposited through shadow masks on top of the ybco film .",
    "this _ in - situ _ process leads to surface resistances 2 or 3 orders of magnitude lower than the usual _ ex - situ _ ones , allowing to observe a sizable josephson coupling at low temperature in these junctions .",
    "ybco / pb junction .",
    "inset : i(v ) curve at 1.3  k. ]       and [ 103 ] junctions .",
    "both display a zbcp , split in the [ 110 ] case .",
    "lower part : temperature evolution of the split zbcp of a [ 110]ybco / pb junction ( curves are shifted for clarity ) .",
    "symbols are experimental data .",
    "lines are the convolution of the experimental data at 1.3  k with the derivative of the fermi function .",
    "data at 1.3  k are taken under b=2500  g to suppress pb superconductivity ( at @xmath9 , this field does not affect the tunneling spectra ) . ]    a reproducible josephson coupling strength i@xmath1r@xmath10v is observed , together with a magnetic field modulation of the critical current . the tunneling spectra exhibit a zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) , as high as 40% of the background conductance , which is a signature of the abs in the qp density of states ( dos)@xcite",
    ". the occurrence of the abs along this direction can be explained by a faceting of the interface in this geometry@xcite . since abs and a josephson current",
    "are observed simultaneously , we expect high order effects to take place@xcite , and an unusual temperature dependence of the critical current to be seen , namely an upward curvature of the i@xmath1(t ) curve .",
    "this relies on the fact that both channels can carry current at zero energy , and that the abs amplitude decreases roughly as @xmath11 . instead ,",
    "a conventional square - root like behavior is observed ( fig.[fig1 ] ) , as if no coupling between the abs and the josephson current exists . besides the fact that the above mentionned computation do not rely on self consistent calculations",
    ", two reasons may explain this experimental result .",
    "first , the film surface is faceted as observed by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) ; the abs and the josephson current may then come from different facets .",
    "second , the amplitude of the abs is small as to compare with those used in calculations , and therefore , could not contribute significantly to the current at low temperature .",
    "together with the formation of the abs , a strong depairing occurs in the [ 110 ] direction for a d@xmath12 symmetry superconductor ( as opposed to the [ 103 ] case ) , which may allow a subdominant component of the order parameter to rise up at the surface@xcite , such as an @xmath13-wave one@xcite . in this case , a @xmath14 state forms within a few coherence length near the surface , below a transition temperature@xcite t@xmath15 .",
    "this state breaks time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath16 ) since spontaneous supercurrents are generated to account for the dephasing between the two components .",
    "this yields to a doppler - like shift of the abs towards finite energies , and thus a splitting of the zbcp@xcite .",
    "we do observe a splitting @xmath17mv of the zbcp in our junctions ( fig.[fig2 ] ) , independently of the barrier resistance ( from @xmath18 to @xmath19 ) . a simple thermal smearing of the low temperature data ( 1.3k ) can account for the high temperature one up to 30k , as expected for a dos effect ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "we thus may conclude that surprisingly @xmath20k in these junctions .",
    "this would give a @xmath13-wave component as high as 30 to 40% of the @xmath0-wave one@xcite , much higher than the reported one@xcite .",
    "however , since the shift of the abs relies on the depression of the dominant @xmath0-wave component of the op at a surface , one should certainly take into account the role of the surface disorder to describe the details of this effect .",
    "a striking feature is the asymmetry of the peaks , in the opposite way of the background , which is not expected for split abs , unless particle - hole symmetry is broken .",
    "this is robust against changes in the junction resistance ( over 3  decades ) and temperature variations .",
    "this gives us confidence that it is not barrier related , but a qp - dos effect instead .",
    "further work is needed to investigate this point .",
    "these junctions also exhibit a josephson current below t@xmath21 , and a hysteretic behavior .",
    "once again , no clear signature of the coupling between the abs and the josephson current is observed .",
    "the fraunhofer pattern of such junctions is not standard .",
    "however , one has to take into account the presence of the spontaneous currents along the interface@xcite .",
    "we have made [ 110 ] and [ 103]ybco / pb junctions .",
    "both show a josephson current and abs , but we have not yet seen any evidence of a coupling between them . in the [ 110 ] case ,",
    "the abs are split by surface - induced broken-@xmath16 state .",
    "this splitting is asymmetric , what remains to be explained .",
