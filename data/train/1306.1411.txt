    "since the publication ( 1687 ) of the `` @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 '' by isaac newton , a large effort has been made to explain the motion of the astrophysical objects by means of the universal gravitation law .",
    "every time some anomalies in the motion of astrophysical objects with respect to the theoretical predictions have been observed , a question arises about the possibility that either it could be a proof of a violation of the gravitational law or a presence of objects not yet observed or which can not be observed ; for example , in 1846 the anomalous motion of uranus allowed the prediction of the existence of neptune and then its observation .",
    "the present topic about dark matter ( dm ) is conceptually very similar to the old problem of unobserved planets ; in fact , today in large astrophysical systems  from galactic scale to the cosmological one  many effects are observed , whose explication requires the presence of a large quantity of non - visible matter .",
    "first attempts to derive the total density of matter in the solar vicinity were made by pik ( 1915)@xcite , kapteyn ( 1922)@xcite , jeans ( 1922)@xcite , and oort ( 1932)@xcite , and the term `` dark matter '' was firstly used in 1922 by kapteyn .    in 1930 first measurements on the red - shift in galaxies and in clusters of galaxies",
    "were carried out .",
    "in particular , in 1933 investigating the coma cluster zwicky @xcite observed a discrepancy between the visible matter ( estimated by its luminosity , @xmath4 , in solar units ) and the total matter of the cluster , @xmath5 , ( measured in solar units ) equal to @xmath6500 . in 1936 smith @xcite obtained an analogous result : @xmath6200 , investigating the virgo cluster . in 1939 ,",
    "other results were obtained for the @xmath7 ratio by babcock @xcite investigating the rotational velocity of the m31 galaxy ; in particular , he observed velocity values in the peripheral region of this galaxy surprisingly high . in 1940",
    "oort @xcite confirmed the result by babcock also in other galaxies measuring a @xmath7 ratio of about 250 . in the 50 page",
    "@xcite performed similar studies on the double galaxies obtaining @xmath7 values always of order of 10@xmath8 , and observing @xmath7 values for elliptical galaxies about 5 times larger than those measured for the spiral ones . in the same period kahn and woltjer",
    "@xcite pursued a new approach to investigate the mass of galaxies systems : they investigated the binary system made of our galaxy and m31 by measuring the relative motion .",
    "this allowed them to derive the mass of the system , obtaining a result that was about 10 times larger than those available at that time .",
    "they attributed this `` extra - mass '' to intergalactic material , indeed they measured the masses of the two galaxies including their dark haloes , as shown today by new measurements @xcite . after the second worldwide war german radar installations were kept in measurement in the netherlands ; oort and his collaborators decided to use them to study the radio emissions of astrophysical objects . in 1954",
    "van de hulst @xcite calculated that the hydrogen has an emission line in the range of the radio - waves frequencies , and pointed out how this radio - emission can allow the measurement of the velocity of the inter - galactic hydrogen gas .",
    "studies of such a radio - emission were performed firstly on our galaxy @xcite and , then , on the m31 galaxy @xcite .",
    "the measurements on m31 showed that the hydrogen gas was present well beyond the luminous region .",
    "moreover , these measurements allowed the investigation of the rotational curve of the galaxy up to a distance of 30 kpc from the galactic center , and thus the determination of the @xmath7 ratio as a function of the galactic radius .",
    "about ten years later , in 1966 , roberts performed a new study of the radio - emission at 21 cm in order to build a mathematical model of the m31 galaxy @xcite ; the new data were in perfect agreement with those obtained by van de hulst and collaborators .",
    "all these efforts and progresses allowed the validation  in the middle of the 70  of the existence of dark matter .",
    "in particular , a crucial result to credit the presence of dark matter was obtained by combining the results of two groups about the rotational velocity of the m31 galaxy as a function of the galactic radius .",
    "rubin and ford @xcite in 1970 obtained the rotational curves of spiral galaxies by studying the emission in the visible region , while roberts and rots @xcite obtained the rotational curves investigating the radio - emissions .",
    "subsequent studies allowed the investigation of the rotational curves for many spiral galaxies , obtaining typically a local @xmath7 ratio in the peripheral region of order of @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , it was shown that all the spiral galaxies have flat rotational curves at large distance @xcite .",
    "all the results confirmed the presence of a dark halo in the galaxies with high confidence level . with time passing other data have been collected @xcite ; new measurements have allowed the investigation of rotational curves up to 80 - 100 kpc . in the case of the milky way",
    ", the rotational curve has been determined up to @xmath1060 kpc @xcite by studying @xmath112500 stars with the @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "the measurements have shown that the velocity tends to decrease with respect to the @xmath11 220 km / s value , which roughly holds in the sun region . on the other side ,",
    "the estimate of the dm halo are still uncertain with values varying in the @xmath16 interval , where @xmath17 = @xmath18 kg is the solar mass .",
    "as regards the dm density in the center of the galaxy , it turns out to be almost equal for all galaxies@xcite : @xmath19 pc@xmath20 .",
    "it is worth noting that the studies of the dispersion velocities of the spherical dwarf galaxies show @xmath7 ratio larger than that observed in the regions nearby us @xcite .",
    "the dispersion velocities of satellite spiral galaxies suggest the existence of a dark halo around spiral galaxies ( as our one ) extended up to @xmath11 200 kpc , far away from the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the rotational velocity of the galaxies as a function of the galactic radius gave very strong support to the existence of a dark matter component in the galactic haloes .",
    "recent data @xcite show no evidence for the presence of a sizeable quantity of dark matter in the disk of the milky way ( its quantity is of order of 15% of the total matter ) .",
    "moreover , the dm in the central region of the galaxy has with high probability a baryonic nature ( proto - stars , non - luminous stars , ... ) considering that the non - baryonic dm can not form a flatten structure ( as the galactic disk ) being dissipation - less .",
    "additional information on the mass distribution in the external region of the galaxy comes from the streams of stars and from the gas@xcite .",
    "kinematic data available for such streams support the existence of a dark and massive galactic halo @xcite .",
    "using the data of the motions of satellite galaxies and of globular clusters , various determinations of the mass of the dark halo give : @xmath21 , in agreement with previous determinations .",
    "in the recent years other streams of stars and gases have been pointed out both in the milky way and in nearby galaxies as m31 . at present",
    "the data available for the kinematics of these streams are few , but in next years important advancements could be expected from the data of the gaia satellite @xcite , whose aim is the measurement of distances and photometric data of millions of stars in the milky way .",
    "other information came from the the @xmath22-rays emissions by galaxies and galaxies clusters studied by the einstein observatory @xcite , rosat , xmm - newton and chandra .",
    "important data also arise from the gravitational @xmath23-@xmath24 produced by stars , planets and invisible matter systems .",
    "as regards big and distant galaxies , the main information is given by the rotational curves and the @xmath22-rays emission of the hot gas surrounding them ; for the nearby dwarf galaxies the main information arises instead from the analysis of the stellar motion .",
    "recently , an important observation , exploiting the gravitational lensing and the @xmath22-rays emission , has been performed on the bullet cluster ( 1e 0657 - 558 ) , that is one of the best evidence of dark matter on cosmological scale @xcite .",
    "the studies have been confirmed by the investigation on the macs j0025.4 - 1222 cluster too @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been detected a dark - matter filament , connecting the two main components of the abell 222/223 supercluster system , through its weak gravitational lensing signal@xcite .",
    "the modern cosmological interpretation includes dark energy as a basic component of the matter - energy content of the universe .",
    "direct observational evidence for the presence of dark energy comes from distant supernovae@xcite and from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations .",
    "after the first studies by iras and cobe , wmap and  recently  planck missions have allowed the measurement of the cmb radiation and its power spectrum with a very high precision @xcite .",
    "the position of the first maximum of the power spectrum depends on the total matter - energy density of the universe .",
    "the spectrum of the cmb fluctuations is presently known down to the scales of 0.1 degree .",
    "in particular , the positions and the relative sizes of the peaks in the power spectrum of cmb strongly support the existence of dark matter in the universe .",
    "in particular , the average density of matter - energy content of the universe in unit of the cosmological critical density ( the amount of matter - energy required to make the universe spatially flat ) , @xmath25 , is consistent with 1 .",
    "considering all the observational data coming from the study of the cmb , of the supernovae ia , of the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and of the large - scale structures , the following contributions to @xmath25 are obtained@xcite : i ) @xmath26 for the radiation density ; ii ) @xmath27 0.05 for the baryonic matter ; iii ) @xmath28 0.27 for the non baryonic dark matter ; iv ) @xmath29 0.68 for the dark energy . a value @xmath27 0.05 for the baryonic matter is also supported by the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , that is based on the predictions of the abundances of the light elements .",
    "this value is much larger than the cosmic density of the luminous matter , @xmath30 @xcite , so that most baryons are dark and , probably , in the form of diffuse intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "for completeness , we recall that some efforts to find alternative explanations to dark matter have been proposed such as @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 ( mog ) in the 1980s @xcite and @xmath31 @xmath34 @xmath35 ( mond ) theory in 1981 @xcite .",
    "they hypothesize that the theory of gravity is incomplete and that a new gravitational theory could explain the experimental observations .",
    "mond modifies the law of motion for very small accelerations , while mog modifies the einstein s theory of gravitation to account for an hypothetical fifth fundamental force in addition to the gravitational , electromagnetic , strong and weak ones .",
    "however , they are unable to account for small and large scale observations , and generally require some amount of dark matter particles as seeds for the structure formation ; moreover , they fail to reproduce accurately the bullet cluster",
    ".    therefore , at the present status of knowledge and considering all the available experimental data , the existence of dark matter in the universe is well recognized , and there are compelling arguments to investigate the presence of dark matter particles also at galactic scale .",
    "the values of the cosmological parameters support that most of the matter in the universe has a non baryonic nature .",
    "the only dm candidate among the known elementary particles is the neutrino ; the density of light neutrinos is strongly constrained by cosmology .",
    "in fact , a value above the limit @xmath36 0.03 gives an unacceptable lack of small - scale structure @xcite .",
    "in addition , a pure light neutrinos scenario is also ruled out by the measurements of the cmb radiation , which does not show sufficiently large inhomogeneity .",
    "therefore , a significant role should be played by non - baryonic relic particles from the big bang , outside the standard model of particle physics ; they have to be stable or with a lifetime comparable with the age of the universe to survive up to now in a significant amount .    in theories extending the standard model of particle physics , many candidates as dark matter particles",
    "have been proposed having different nature and interaction types .",
    "it is worth noting that often the acronym _ wimp _ ( weakly interacting massive particle ) is adopted as a synonymous of dark matter particle , referring usually to a particle with spin - independent elastic scattering on target - nuclei . on the contrary ,",
    "_ wimp _ identifies a class of dark matter candidates which can have different phenomenologies and interaction types among them .",
    "this is also the case when considering a given candidate as for example the neutralino ; in fact the basic supersymmetric theory has a very large number of parameters which are by the fact unknown and , depending on the assumptions , the candidates can have well different features and preferred interaction types . often constrained sugra models ( which allow easier calculations for the predictions e.g. at accelerators ) are presented as susy or as the only way to susy , which is indeed not the case .    among the many dm candidates we recall : susy particles ( as e.g. neutralino @xcite or sneutrino in various scenarios @xcite ) , inelastic dark matter in various scenarios @xcite , electron interacting dark matter ( also including some _",
    "wimp _ scenarios ) @xcite , a heavy neutrino of the 4-th family , sterile neutrino @xcite , kaluza - klein particles , self - interacting dark matter @xcite , axion - like ( light pseudoscalar and scalar candidate ) @xcite , mirror dark matter in various scenarios @xcite , resonant dark matter @xcite , dm from exotic 4th generation quarks @xcite , elementary black holes @xcite , planckian objects @xcite , daemons @xcite , composite dm @xcite , light scalar _ wimp _ through higgs portal @xcite , complex scalar dark matter @xcite , specific two higgs doublet models , exothermic dm @xcite , secluded _ wimps _",
    "@xcite , asymmetric dm @xcite , isospin - violating dark matter @xcite , singlet dm @xcite , specific gu @xcite , superwimps @xcite , wimpzilla @xcite , and also further scenarios and models as e.g. those given in ref .",
    "moreover , even a suitable particle not yet foreseen by theories could be the solution or one of the solutions .",
    "depending on the dm candidate , the interaction processes can be various , as e.g : 1 ) elastic scatterings on target nuclei with either spin - independent or spin - dependent or mixed coupling ; moreover , an additional electromagnetic contribution can arise , in case of few gev candidates , from the excitation of bound electrons by the recoiling nuclei @xcite ; 2 ) inelastic scatterings on target nuclei with either spin - independent or spin - dependent or mixed coupling in various scenarios @xcite ; 3 ) interaction of light dm ( ldm ) either on electrons or on nuclei with production of a lighter particle @xcite ; 4 ) preferred interaction with electrons @xcite ; 5 ) conversion of dm particles into electromagnetic radiation @xcite ; 6 ) etc .. thus , the dark matter interaction processes can have well different nature depending on the candidate . often , the elastic scattering on target nuclei is the considered process , but other processes are possible and considered in literature , as those aforementioned where also electromagnetic radiation is produced .",
    "hence , considering the richness of particle possibilities and the existing uncertainties on related astrophysical ( e.g. halo model and related parameters , etc . ) , nuclear ( e.g. form factors , spin factors , scaling laws , etc . ) and particle physics ( e.g. particle nature and interaction types , etc . ) , a widely - sensitive model independent approach is mandatory .",
    "indeed , most of the activities in the field are based on a particular _ a priori _ assumption on the nature of the dm particle and of its interaction , in order to try to overcome the limitation arising from their generally large originally measured counting rate .",
    "the expected energy distribution for the interactions of dark matter particles in a terrestrial detector depends on their density and velocity distribution at earth s position .",
    "however , the experimental observations regarding the dark halo of our galaxy do not allow us to get information on this crucial key item without introducing a model for the galaxy matter density .",
    "a widely used density distribution of dark matter is the isothermal sphere model ; it consists in a spherical infinite system with a flat rotational curve . due to its simplicity ,",
    "the isothermal sphere model is often the used assumption in the evaluation of dark matter expected rates .",
    "however many of its underlying assumptions ( sphericity of the halo , absence of rotation , isotropy of the dispersion tensor , flatness of the rotational curve ) are not strongly constrained by astrophysical observations . moreover ,",
    "the isothermal sphere is strictly unphysical and may only represent the behavior of the inner part of physical systems , since it has a total infinite mass and needs some cutoff at large radii .",
    "thus , the use of more realistic halo models is mandatory in the interpretation and comparison procedures , since the model dependent results can significantly vary .",
    "an extensive discussion about some of the more credited halo models has been reported e.g. in ref . and references therein .",
    "generally , the halo models can be grouped in the following classes : i ) spherically symmetric matter density with isotropic velocity dispersion ; ii ) spherically symmetric matter density with non - isotropic velocity dispersion ; iii ) axisymmetric models ; iv ) triaxial models ; v ) axisymmetric models either with a halo co - rotation or a halo counter - rotation .",
    "the possible rotation can be considered also for the other kinds of halo .",
    "a parameterization of these classes of halo models has been given in ref .",
    ", taking into account the available observational data .",
    "anyhow , information on the galactic dark halo can be obtained only in indirect way @xcite and considering some hypotheses on its form and characteristic .",
    "in particular , the allowed range of values for the dark matter local velocity @xcite can be estimated considering the information coming from the rotational curve of our galaxy : @xmath37 km s@xmath38 ( 90% c.l . ) , that conservatively relies on purely dynamical observations @xcite . similar estimates of the @xmath39 central value with smaller uncertainty have been obtained studying the proper motion of nearby stars in the hypothesis of circular orbit of these objects .",
    "for example , the value @xmath40 km s@xmath38 has been determined mapping the gd-1 stellar stream @xcite . as discussed in ref . , these determinations are strongly dependent on other parameters ( the distance from the galactic center , the solar velocity @xmath41 , the adopted density profile , etc . ) .",
    "these parameters are themselves affected by strong uncertainties ; thus , depending on their choice the estimate of the rotational speed may vary from @xmath42 to @xmath43 km s@xmath38 .",
    "similar considerations can also be done for the escape velocity of the galaxy , on which many dm models , and in particular the inelastic dm and the low mass dm inducing nuclear elastic scatterings , are critically dependent .",
    "for each model  after fixing the local velocity  the allowed range of local density @xmath44 can be evaluated ; it ranges for the considered models in the values 0.21.7 gev cm@xmath20 when taking into account the following physical constraints : i ) the amount of flatness of the rotational curve of our galaxy , considering conservatively @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the value of rotational curve at distance of 100 kpc from the galactic center ; ii ) the maximal non dark halo components in the galaxy , considering conservatively @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "although the large number of self - consistent galactic halo models considered in refs . ,",
    "still many other possibilities exist and have been proposed in recent years , such as the einasto profile @xcite .",
    "moreover , the possible contributions of non - thermalized dark matter components to the galactic halo , such as the sagdeg stream@xcite and other kinds of streams as those arising from caustic halo models@xcite , could change the local dm speed distribution and the local density .",
    "these contributions can also play a significant role in the model - dependent investigations for the candidate particle .",
    "some analyses in this scenarios have been proposed @xcite .    to improve our knowledge of the galactic haloes , low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies dominated by dark matter",
    "have been studied @xcite ; these studies have shown a cored profile distribution in all the considered galaxies excluding the presence of the cusp , expected by @xmath49cdm model . in the light of these experimental results on lsb galaxies , which show cored profiles , and of the theoretical results of n - body simulations ( millennium , deus fur , horizon , multi dark , bolshoi , aquarius , phoenix etc . ) , which instead expect a cusp in the galaxies central region , new efforts are in progress with the aim to develop new n - body simulations able to reproduce all the experimental observations .",
    "a review on the state of art is given , for example , in ref . .",
    "in conclusion , the uncertainties still present on the shape of the dm halo and on the density and velocity distribution prevent the definition of a `` standard '' halo and illustrate how the comparisons among the experiments of direct detection of dm particles ( see later ) can be consistent even just considering this particular aspect ( also see ref . ) .",
    "in the following , we will briefly discuss and comment about the indirect and the direct detection of dark matter particles .",
    "firstly let us comment about the possibility to detect dark matter by accelerator experiments .",
    "it is worth noting that experiments at accelerators may prove  when they can state a solid model independent result  the existence of some possible dm candidate particles , but they could never credit by themselves that a certain particle is a / the only solution for dark matter particle(s ) . moreover ,",
    "dm candidate particles and scenarios ( even e.g. in the case of the neutralino candidate ) exist which can not be investigated at accelerators .",
    "thus , a model independent approach , a ultra - low - background suitable target material , a very large exposure and the full control of running conditions are mandatory to pursue a widely sensitive direct detection of dm particles in the galactic halo .",
    "we preliminary briefly remind the current state of indirect dark matter searches , whose results are strongly model - dependent .",
    "they are generally performed as by - product of experiments located underground , under - water , under - ice or in space having different main scientific purpose .",
    "in particular , these experiments search for the presence of secondary particles produced by some kind of dark matter candidates able to annihilate in the celestial bodies when some specific assumptions are fulfilled .",
    "thus , their results are restricted to some candidates and physical scenarios , and require also the modeling of the existing  and largely unknown  competing background for the secondary particles they are looking for .",
    "it is worth noting that no quantitative comparison can be directly performed between the results obtained in direct and indirect searches because it strongly depends on assumptions and on the considered model framework .",
    "in particular , a comparison would always require the calculation and the consideration of all the possible configurations for each given particle model ( e.g. for neutralino : in the allowed parameters space ) , as a biunivocal correspondence between the observables in the two kinds of experiments does not exist : cross sections in the direct detection case and e.g. flux of muons from neutrinos ( or of other secondary particles ) in the indirect searches .",
    "in fact , the counting rate in direct search is proportional to the direct detection cross sections , while the flux of secondary particles is connected also to the annihilation cross section . in principle",
    ", these cross sections can be correlated , but only when a specific model is adopted and by non directly proportional relations .    as regards under - water and under - ice experiments , results are available from antares @xcite and icecube @xcite , both looking for up - going muons ascribed to muon neutrino interactions in the earth and assuming they have been produced in the annihilation of dark matter particles in a certain considered scenario ; no excess above an estimate of up - going muons from atmospheric neutrinos has been presented by both experiments .",
    "similar approaches have been considered in some kinds of underground detectors ( for example , macro , superkamiokande , ... ) as well .",
    "as regards the space investigations , an excess of the measured positron fraction above an assumed background model was presented by pamela @xcite and ams-02 @xcite experiments , but analogous models also exist with different secondary production giving no very significant deviation @xcite .",
    "in addition , since no excess has been observed in the anti - proton spectrum , a similar candidate should be `` leptophilic '' ; that is , e.g. not observable by those direct detection experiments which select just nuclear recoil - like events from the measured counting rate , as e.g. cdms , edelweiss , cresst , xenon , etc .. , while it can be detected in dama experiments which exploit a different methodology ( see later ) .",
    "anyhow , additional aspects arise when trying to explain the pamela and ams-02 data in a dark matter interpretation since e.g. a very large boost factor ( @xmath50 ) would be required , whose origin can not be easily justified unless introducing a new kind of interaction @xcite .",
    "thus , this excess can be due to an inadequacy of the considered model used to describe and propagate all the possible sources of secondaries ; moreover , in literature it has also been shown that some kinds of known sources can account for a similar positron fraction @xcite .",
    "therefore , no constraint on direct detection phenomenology arises from positron fraction ; anyhow , if those data were interpreted  under several assumptions  in terms of some dark matter scenario , this would be not in conflict with the dama model - independent results described later .    another possible model - dependent positive hint from space and its compatibility with the dama results",
    "have been discussed in ref . , considering a particular analysis of data from fermi : close to the galactic center the spectral shape of the observed emission is significantly different , peaking at 1 - 5 gev , with respect to a background model which well describes the spectral shape outside the galactic center over the disk .",
    "it has been suggested that this may be due to annihilations of light dark matter particles .",
    "another indication for a possible excess above an assumed background model from fermi - lat is in the form of a narrow bump in the @xmath51-ray spectrum near 130 gev @xcite ; however , a deeper investigation shows the presence of two bumps at 135 gev ( 2.2@xmath52 c.l . ) and",
    "near 130 gev in the earth limb data ( about 3@xmath52 c.l . ) .",
    "the fermi collaboration points out a few other details @xcite : i ) the 135 gev feature is not as smooth as expected if it were due to some dark matter annihilation ; ii ) similar bumps are present with similar significance at other energies and other places in the sky ( as those near 5 gev at 3.7@xmath52 c.l . ) . in addition , the inclusion of other astrophysical objects can account for the fermi data .",
    "all that shows the intrinsic uncertainties of the dm indirect searches to unambiguously assess the presence of a dark matter signal , and the absence of direct constraints on direct searches .      in the direct detection field ,",
    "different experimental approaches have been considered in order to point out the presence of dark matter component(s ) in our galaxy .",
    "originally it was pursued an approach based on the simple comparison of the measured energy distribution in a defined energy interval , with one of the possible expectations fixing some particular astrophysical , nuclear and particle scenario .",
    "this approach is the only feasible one either for small scale or poor duty cycle experiments and allows the exclusion of some free parameters ( e.g. particle mass and particle - nucleus cross - section ) at a given c.l . for the assumed model scenario .",
    "although for long time the limits achieved by this approach have been presented as robust reference points , similar results are quite uncertain because e.g. they depend on the specific model framework used to estimate the expected counting rate as well as obviously on the reliability of the adopted experimental procedures and parameters . in fact , it is worth noting that this approach generally assumes _ a priori _ the nature of the dm candidate , its interaction type , astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics aspects and experimental features .",
    "for example , exclusion plots can be modified even by orders of magnitude by changing ( within the allowed intervals ) the values of the parameters used in a given scenario .",
    "in addition , important sources of uncertainties can arise from the under - estimation of systematics in experiments adopting relevant data handling .",
    "in fact , more recently , some experiments  to try to reduce their experimental counting rate  apply large data selections and several subtraction procedures in order to derive a set of nuclear recoil - like candidates , assuming _ a priori _  among others  the nature and the interaction type of the dm candidate .",
    "thus , each exclusion plot should be considered strictly correlated with the assumed model framework , with the used experimental / theoretical assumptions and parameters and with detailed information on possible data reduction / selection , on efficiencies , calibration procedures , etc . moreover ,",
    "when for example a generic dm candidate inducing just nuclear recoils with purely spin - independent ( si ) coupling is considered , in order to try to compare exclusion plots as well as allowed regions the results are generally scaled to cross sections on nucleon for the different target nuclei ; thus some scaling law(s ) has(have ) to be adopted .",
    "a scaling law according to @xmath53 is generally assumed ( where @xmath54 is the atomic number of each considered nucleus ) , while relevant deviations are possible . in particular , for the case of neutralino candidate the two - nucleon currents in the nucleus can add different contribution for different nuclei ( see as an example of some discussion ref . ) .",
    "also this problem of scaling laws is one of the aspects that have a great relevance in the comparison between results obtained by experiments using different target materials . by the fact",
    ", the scaling laws should be derived in physics from the experimental measurements themselves and not imposed _ a priori_.",
    "just as another example , we mention that when the case of dm candidates with purely or mixed spin dependent ( sd ) interaction scattering on target nuclei is considered , a relevant role is played by the nuclear spin factor of each target nucleus @xcite ; in fact , not only large differences in the measured rate can be expected for target nuclei sensitive to the sd component of the interaction ( such as e.g. @xmath55na and @xmath56i ) with respect to those largely insensitive to such a coupling ( such as e.g. @xmath57ge and @xmath57si ) , but also when using different target nuclei although  in principle  all sensitive to such a coupling . in fact , very large differences exist in different nuclear models and even within the same model ; in particular , e.g. in the case of @xmath55na and @xmath56i , having a proton as unpaired nucleon , and @xmath58si , @xmath59ge , @xmath60xe , @xmath61xe , having a neutron as unpaired nucleon , the sensitivities are almost complementary , depending on the @xmath62 value ( ratio between the neutron and the proton effective sd coupling strengths ) .",
    "see some values of spin factors reported e.g. in ref . .",
    "other arguments are addressed in the following .",
    "the above mentioned uncertainties in the model evaluations and in the experimental procedures must be always taken into account when trying to compare exclusion plots and/or allowed regions , when available , for each kind of scenario .",
    "thus , in order to obtain a reliable signature for the presence of dm particles in the galactic halo , it is necessary to follow a suitable model independent approach .",
    "in particular , the only dm model independent signature presently feasible is the so - called dm annual modulation signature . for completeness",
    ", we also mention a different approach described in the following for the direct detection of dm candidates inducing just nuclear recoils ; it is based on the study of the correlation of the nuclear recoil direction with the earth velocity .",
    "this approach has relevant technical difficulties , when the detection of the short nuclear recoil track is pursued ; similar activities are up to now at r&d stage .",
    "in particular , we remind drift ( that has realized multi - wire proportional chambers at low pressure @xcite ) , and dm - tpc ( that uses a ccd camera to track recoils in a cf@xmath63 volume @xcite ) . a different strategy , which can allow one to overcome",
    "the present difficulties avoiding the necessity to detect directly the nuclear recoil tracks , has been suggested : the use of anisotropic scintillators @xcite .",
    "they offer different light responses depending on the nucleus recoil direction with respect to the scintillator s axes ( other efforts on this subject have been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; since the response to @xmath64 radiation is isotropic instead , these detectors can offer the possibility to efficiently study possible anisotropy of nuclear recoils @xcite .",
    "low background znwo@xmath63 crystal scintillators have recently been proposed ; the features and performances of such scintillators are very promising @xcite .",
    "it is also worthwhile to mention the investigation of possible sidereal diurnal effects , which can be due to the earth rotation velocity , to the shadow of the earth ( this latter case sensitive just to dm candidates with high cross sections and tiny density ) , and to channeling effects in crystals detectors and/or to anisotropic responses of detectors in case of dm particle inducing nuclear recoils .",
    "some other arguments on direct search activities will be addressed in sect .",
    "[ moddep ] . in the following",
    "we will introduce the annual modulation model independent signature , which is the approach exploited by dama .      to obtain a reliable signature for the presence of dm particles in the galactic halo , it is necessary to follow a suitable model independent approach .",
    "in particular , the only dm model independent signature , feasible and able to test a large range of cross sections and of dm particle halo densities , is the so - called dm annual modulation signature originally suggested in the middle of 80 in ref . .",
    "in fact , as a consequence of its annual revolution around the sun , which is moving in the galaxy traveling with respect to the local standard of rest towards the star vega near the constellation of hercules , the earth should be crossed by a larger flux of dark matter particles around @xmath11 june @xmath65 ( when the earth orbital velocity is summed to the one of the solar system with respect to the galaxy ) and by a smaller one around @xmath11 december @xmath65 ( when the two velocities are subtracted ) .",
    "thus , this signature has a different origin and peculiarities than the seasons on the earth and than effects correlated with seasons ( consider the expected value of the phase as well as the other requirements listed below ) .",
    "experimentally , the expected differential rate as a function of the energy , @xmath66 ( see ref . for detailed discussion ) , depends on the dark matter particles velocity distribution and on the earth s velocity in the galactic frame , @xmath67 . projecting @xmath67 on the galactic plane , one can write : @xmath68 ; here @xmath41 is the sun s velocity with respect to the galactic halo ( @xmath69 km / s and @xmath39 is the local velocity whose value has been previously discussed ) ; @xmath70 30 km / s is the earth s orbital velocity around the sun on a plane with inclination @xmath51 = 60@xmath71 with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "furthermore , @xmath72= 2@xmath73/t with t=1 year and roughly t@xmath74 @xmath10 june 2@xmath75 ( when the earth s speed is at maximum ) .",
    "the earth s velocity can be conveniently expressed in unit of @xmath39 : @xmath76 , where  depending on the assumed value of the local velocity  @xmath77=1.04 - 1.07 is the yearly average of @xmath78 and @xmath79 = 0.05 - 0.09 . since @xmath80",
    ", the expected counting rate can be expressed by the first order taylor expansion : @xmath81 = \\frac{dr}{de_r}[\\eta_0 ] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\eta } \\left ( \\frac{dr}{de_r } \\right)_{\\eta = \\eta_0 } \\delta \\eta \\cos\\omega(t - t_0 ) .\\ ] ] averaging this expression in a @xmath82-th energy interval one obtains : @xmath83_{\\eta_0 } \\delta\\eta cos\\omega(t - t_0 ) = s_{0,k } + s_{m , k}cos\\omega(t - t_0 ) , \\label{eq : sm}\\ ] ] with the contribution from the highest order terms less than 0.1@xmath84 .",
    "this dm annual modulation signature is very distinctive since a dark matter - induced effect must simultaneously satisfy all the following requirements : the rate must contain a component modulated according to a cosine function ( 1 ) with one year period ( 2 ) and a phase that peaks roughly around @xmath10 june 2@xmath75 ( 3 ) ; this modulation must only be found in a well - defined low energy range , where dm particles can induce signal ( 4 ) ; it must apply to those events in which just one detector of many actually `` fires '' , since the dark matter multi - scattering probability is negligible ( 5 ) ; the modulation amplitude in the region of maximal sensitivity must be @xmath857@xmath84 for usually adopted halo distributions ( 6 ) , but it can be larger in case of some possible scenarios such as e.g. those in refs . @xcite .",
    "thus , no other effect investigated so far in the field of rare processes offers a so stringent and unambiguous signature . with the present technology ,",
    "the annual modulation remains the main signature to directly point out the presence of dark matter particles in the galactic halo .",
    "it is worth noting that , when exploiting such a signature , the experimental observable is not the constant part of the signal s@xmath74 ( hereafter @xmath82 is omitted )  which instead the other approaches try to extract from their measured counting rate  but its modulation amplitude , s@xmath86 , as a function of energy .",
    "this has several advantages ; in particular , in this approach the only background of interest is that able to mimic the signature , i.e. able to account for the whole observed modulation amplitude and to simultaneously satisfy all the many specific peculiarities of the signature .",
    "no background of this sort has been found or suggested by anyone over more than a decade . in particular , the dm model - independent annual modulation approach does not require any identification of s@xmath74 from the total _ single - hit _ counting rate , in order to establish the presence of dm particles in the galactic halo .",
    "the s@xmath74 value can be worked out by a maximum likelihood analysis , which also takes into account the energy behaviour of each detector @xcite , for each considered scenario .",
    "thus , the dm annual modulation signature allows one to avoid _ a priori _ assumptions on the nature and interaction type of the dm particle(s ) and to overcome the large uncertainties associated to the exploitation of heavy data handling procedures , to the modeling of surviving background in kev region , etc .",
    "pursued instead in approaches trying to extract @xmath87 from the measured counting rate assuming _ a priori _ the candidates and/or the interaction type , as mentioned above .",
    "obviously , the implementation of ulb ( @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 ) detectors and set - ups , the implementation of suitably controlled running conditions and the choice of a widely sensitive target material are important as well .",
    "the dama experiment has been and is working as an observatory for rare processes by developing and using low radioactive scintillators .",
    "it is installed deep underground in the gran sasso national laboratory ( lngs ) of infn . several low background",
    "set - ups are operative and many different kinds of measurements are carried out @xcite .",
    "in particular , dedicated set - ups have been developed to investigate the presence of dm particles in the galactic halo by exploiting the dm annual modulation signature ; they are : i ) dama / nai ( @xmath10 100 kg of highly radiopure nai(tl ) ) that took data over 7 annual cycles and completed its data taking on july 2002 @xcite ; ii ) the second generation dama / libra set - up ( @xmath10 250 kg highly radiopure nai(tl ) ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , dama / nai and dama / libra use ulb nai(tl ) detectors to investigate dm .",
    "in fact , highly radiopure nai(tl ) scintillators offer many competitive features to effectively investigate the dm annual modulation signature , such as e.g. : i ) high duty cycle ; ii ) well known technology ; iii ) large masses feasible ; iv ) no safety problems ; v ) the lowest cost with respect to every other considered technique ; vi ) necessity of a relatively small underground space ; vii ) reachable high radiopurity by suitable material selections and protocols , by chemical / physical purifications , etc . ;",
    "viii ) feasibility of well controlled operational conditions and monitoring ; ix ) feasibility of routine calibrations down to few kev in the same conditions as the production runs ; x ) high light response ( that is kev threshold really reachable ) ; xi ) absence of the necessity of re - purification or cooling down / warming up procedures ( implying high reproducibility , high stability , etc . ) ; xii ) absence of microphonic noise and effective noise rejection at threshold ( time decay of nai(tl ) pulses is hundreds ns , while that of noise pulses is tens ns ) ; xiii ) possibility to use fragmented set - up which allows effective signal identification and background rejection ; xiv ) wide sensitivity to both high and low mass dm candidates and to many different interaction types and astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics scenarios ; xv ) possibility to effectively investigate the dm annual modulation signature in all the needed aspects ; xvi ) possibility to achieve significant results on several other rare processes ; xvii ) etc .",
    "long dedicated r&d projects have been implemented in order to select all the involved materials ; moreover , purification procedures , protocols , etc . have been adopted .",
    "dama members made such efforts during about 20 years of developments .",
    "the dama / nai set - up and its performances are described in refs . , while the dama / libra set - up , its main features and radiopurity have been discussed in refs . .",
    "here we just summarize few information .",
    "the dama / nai experiment @xcite has been a pioneer experiment running at lngs until 2002 , investigating as first the dm annual modulation signature with suitable exposed mass , sensitivity and control of the running parameters .",
    "it was composed by nine 9.70 kg highly radiopure nai(tl ) crystal scintillators in suitable radiopure cu housing installed in a low - background passive shield .",
    "some upgradings have been performed during its operation @xcite .",
    "the installation of dama / libra started at the dismounting of the former dama / nai in july 2002 .",
    "the experimental site as well as many components of the installation itself have been implemented .",
    "all the procedures performed during the dismounting of dama / nai and the installation of dama / libra detectors have been carried out in high purity ( hp ) nitrogen atmosphere .",
    "the nai(tl ) dama / libra apparatus uses 25 nai(tl ) highly radiopure detectors with 9.70 kg mass each one ( @xmath91 @xmath92 volume ) placed in five rows by five columns .",
    "the identification number of each detector ( as it will be used later ) is from the left ( looking at the set - up from the door of inner barrack ) : 1 to 5 in the bottom ( first ) row , 6 to 10 in the second row and so on .",
    "the granularity of the apparatus is an interesting feature for dark matter particle investigations since dark matter particles can just contribute to events where only one of the 25 detectors fires ( single - hit events ) and not to whom where more than one detector fire in coincidence ( multiple - hit events ) .",
    "the new dama / libra detectors have been built by joint efforts with _ saint gobain crystals and detectors _ company .",
    "the constituting materials have been selected by using several techniques ; moreover , some chemical / physical purifications of selected powders have been exploited and results tested .",
    "in addition , the more effective growing procedure has been applied and new rules for handling the bare crystals have been fixed .",
    "the bare crystals have been grown by kyropoulos method in a platinum crucible according to a strict growing and handling protocol developed and agreed under confidential restriction .",
    "the bare crystals are enveloped in tetratec - teflon foils and encapsulated in radiopure ofhc cu housing ; each detector is sealed in low radioactivity freshly electrolyzed copper housing and has two 10 cm long highly radiopure quartz ( suprasil b ) light guides which also act as optical windows being directly coupled to the bare crystals . in each detector",
    "the light guides are optically coupled to the two end - faces of the bare crystal and to two low background photomultipliers ( pmt ) .",
    "the threshold of each pmt is set at single photoelectron level ; the coincidence of the two pmts on a detector provides the trigger of the detector .",
    "the pmts are shielded from the detectors through the light guides and through a honeycomb - like shaped cu shielding .",
    "the detectors are housed in a low radioactivity sealed copper box installed in the center of the low - radioactivity cu / pb / cd - foils / polyethylene / paraffin shield ; moreover , about 1 m concrete ( made from the gran sasso rock material ) almost fully surrounds ( mostly outside the barrack ) this passive shield , acting as a further neutron moderator .",
    "the copper box is maintained in hp nitrogen atmosphere in slightly overpressure with respect to the external environment ; it is part of the 3-level sealing system which excludes the detectors from environmental air .",
    "the whole installation is air - conditioned to assure a suitable and stable working temperature for the electronics .",
    "the huge heat capacity of the multi - tons passive shield ( @xmath93 cal@xmath94c ) assures further a relevant stability of the detectors operating temperature ( see also later ) .",
    "in particular , two independent systems of air conditioning are available for redundancy : one cooled by water refrigerated by a devoted chiller and the other operating with cooling gas .    following the same strategy as dama / nai , on the top of the shield a glove - box ( also continuously maintained in the hp nitrogen atmosphere )",
    "is directly connected to the inner cu box , housing the detectors , through cu pipes .",
    "the pipes are filled with low radioactivity cu bars ( covered by 10 cm of low radioactive cu and 15 cm of low radioactive pb ) which can be removed to allow the insertion of radioactive sources for calibrating the detectors in the same running condition , without any contact with external air .",
    "the glove - box is also equipped with a compensation chamber .",
    "a hardware / software system to monitor the running conditions is operative and self - controlled computer processes automatically control several parameters and manage alarms .",
    "for the electronic chain , the data acquisition system and for all the other details see refs . .",
    "the dama / libra set - up allows the recording both of the _ single - hit _ events ( those events where just one detector of many actually fires ) and of the _ multiple - hit _ events ( those events where more than one detector fire ) .",
    "the experiment takes data up to the mev scale despite the optimization is done for the lowest energy region .",
    "the linearity and the energy resolution of the detectors at low and high energy have been investigated using several sources as discussed e.g. in ref . .",
    "in particular , as regards the low energy region , calibrations down to the 3.2 kev x - ray have been carried out . during the production",
    "runs periodical calibrations ( every @xmath10 10 days ) are carried out with @xmath95am sources , introduced in the proximity of the detectors by source holders inserted in the cu pipes mentioned above .    the energy threshold , the pmt gain , the electronic line stability are continuously monitored during the data taking by the routine calibrations , by the position and energy resolution of internal lines @xcite and by the study of the behaviour of the hardware rate of each detector above single photoelectron level @xcite with time .",
    "the main procedures of the dama data taking for the investigation of dm particles annual modulation signature are : 1 ) the data taking of each annual cycle starts when @xmath96 in autumn towards summer , after june 2@xmath75 when the maximum is expected ; 2 ) the routine calibrations with radioactive sources for energy calibrations and for the evaluation of the acceptance windows efficiency @xcite are performed about each 10 days ( collecting typically @xmath97 events per kev ) , moreover regularly intrinsic calibration are carried out , etc . @xcite ; 3 ) the on - line monitoring of all the running parameters is continuously carried out with automatic alarm to operator if any would go out of allowed range .",
    "dama / libra starts the data taking in 2003 .",
    "a first upgrade of this set - up was performed in september 2008 .",
    "one detector was recovered by replacing a broken pmt and a new optimization of some pmts and hvs was done ; the transient digitizers were replaced with new ones ( the u1063a acqiris 8-bit 1gs / s dc270 high - speed cpci digitizers ) having better performances and a new daq with optical read - out was installed .",
    "the dama / libra  phase1 concluded its data taking in this configuration on 2010 ; the data released so far correspond to 6 annual cycles .",
    "the data of the seventh annual cycle of this phase1 will be released soon . in particular , the measured light response was 5.5 - 7.5 photoelectrons / kev depending on the detector and the software energy threshold was 2 kev electron equivalent ( hereafter kev ) .",
    "information about the annual cycles of dama / libra  phase1 is given in table [ tb : years ] .",
    "a further and more important upgrade has been performed at the end of 2010 when all the pmts have been replaced with new ones having higher quantum efficiency ; details on the developments and on the reached performances in the operative conditions are reported in ref . .",
    "since january 2011 dama / libra  phase2 is running in order : 1 ) to increase the experimental sensitivity lowering the software energy threshold of the experiment ; 2 ) to improve the corollary investigation on the nature of the dark matter particle and related astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics arguments ; 3 ) to investigate other signal features ; 4 ) to improve the sensitivity in the investigation of rare processes other than dark matter as performed by the former dama / nai apparatus in the past @xcite and by itself so far @xcite .",
    "this requires long and heavy full time dedicated work for reliable collection and analysis of very large exposures , as dama collaboration has always done .",
    "the dama / libra data released so far correspond to 6 annual cycles for an exposure of 0.87 ton@xmath98yr ( see table [ tb : years ] ) @xcite . considering these data together with those previously collected by dama / nai over 7 annual cycles ( 0.29 ton@xmath98yr ) ,",
    "the total exposure collected over 13 independent annual cycles is 1.17 ton@xmath98yr ; this is orders of magnitude larger than the exposures typically collected in the field .",
    "the only treatment , which is performed on the raw data , is to remove noise pulses ( mainly pmt noise , cherenkov light in the light guides and in the pmt windows , and afterglows ) near the energy threshold in the _ single - hit _ events ; for a description of the used procedure and details see e.g. ref . .",
    "as regard calibrations , e.g. during the 6 dama / libra annual cycles , about @xmath99 events have been collected for energy calibrations and about @xmath100 events / kev for the evaluation of the acceptance windows efficiency for noise rejection near the energy threshold @xcite .",
    "these periodical calibrations and , in particular , those related with the acceptance windows efficiency mainly affect the duty cycle of the experiment .    several analyses on the model - independent dm annual modulation signature have been performed ( see refs .   and refs . therein ) .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ fg : res ] shows the time behaviour of the experimental    residual rates for _ single - hit _ events in the ( 24 ) , ( 25 ) , and ( 26 ) kev energy intervals , the only energy intervals where the modulation effect is present .",
    "in fact , other possible energy intervals have also been studied , and no modulation has been found ( see later ) .",
    "this residual rate is calculated from the measured rate of the _ single - hit _ events ( already corrected for the overall efficiency and for the acquisition dead time ) after subtracting the constant part : @xmath101 . here",
    "@xmath102 is the rate in the considered @xmath103-th time interval for the @xmath104-th detector in the @xmath82-th energy bin , while @xmath105 is the rate of the @xmath104-th detector in the @xmath82-th energy bin averaged over the cycles .",
    "the average is made on all the detectors ( @xmath104 index ) and on all the energy bins ( @xmath82 index ) which constitute the considered energy interval .",
    "the weighted mean of the residuals must obviously be zero over one cycle .",
    "the hypothesis of absence of modulation in the data can be discarded , as reported in table [ tb : mod_0 ] .    the _ single - hit _ residual rate of dama / nai and dama / libra data of fig .",

    "the fit procedure takes into account also the experimental error of each data point ; the results are shown in table [ tb : ampff ] .    the compatibility among the 13 annual cycles can also be investigated . in particular , the modulation amplitudes measured in each annual cycle of the whole 1.17 ton @xmath98 yr exposure are reported in fig .",
    "[ fg : amp ] .",
    "indeed these modulation amplitudes are normally distributed around their best fit value as pointed out by the @xmath112 test ( @xmath113 , 12.2 and 10.1 over 12 _ d.o.f .",

    "the period and the phase are well compatible with the expectations for a signal in the dm annual modulation signature .",
    "in particular , the phase  whose better determination will be achieved in the following by using a maximum likelihood analysis  is consistent with about june @xmath65 within @xmath114 ; moreover , for completeness , we also note that a slight energy dependence of the phase could be expected in case of possible contributions of non - thermalized dm components to the galactic halo , such as e.g. the sagdeg stream @xcite and the caustics @xcite .",

    "] , with a still lower modulation amplitude : about @xmath193 @xcite , by adding the data collected in a further year ; the appreciable difference in the fitted values further demonstrates the large variability of the muon flux feature year by year .",
    "the measured muon variation at lngs has no impact on the dama annual modulation results for many reasons ; in the following we summarize the key items .",
    "let us firstly recall that a muon flux variation can not play any role in the dama result @xcite , not only because it may give rise to quantitatively negligible effects , but also because it is unable to mimic the dm signature .",
    "in fact , it would fail some requirements of the signature ; namely e.g. : ( i ) it would induce variation in the whole energy spectrum ; ( ii ) it would induce variation also in the _ multiple - hits _ events ( events in which more than one detector `` fires '' ) , ( iii ) it would induce variation with a phase and amplitude distinctively different from the dama measured one .    the phase of muons surviving the lngs coverage and the phase of the ( 26 ) kev _ single - hit _ events measured by dama are distinctively different ( see fig .",
    "[ fg : phase ] ) .",
    "in particular , the values quoted by macro , lvd and borexino experiments for the muon phase have to be regarded as mean values of the muon phases among the analyzed years and the associated errors are not simply due to statistical fluctuation of the data , but rather to the variations of the muon phase in the different years .",
    "the phase of the dama observed effect has instead a stable value in the different years @xcite and is 5.7 ( 5.9 , 4.7 ) @xmath52 from the lvd ( borexino , first and recently modified evaluations , respectively ) `` mean '' phase of muons ( 7.1 @xmath52 from the macro one ) .",
    "( date around which the phase of the dm annual modulation is expected ) .",
    "the middle of june is also marked as an example ; in fact , the maximum temperature of the @xmath194 at the lngs location ( see text ) can not be as early as the middle of june ( and for several years ) , date which is still 3 @xmath52 far away from the phase of the dama observed effect .",
    "@xcite , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    this latter simple approach does not consider that the experimental errors in the muon flux are not completely gaussian ; however , it gives the right order of magnitude of the confidence level for the incompatibility between the dama phase and the phase of muons and of the muon - induced effects .",
    "analyses carried out by different authors confirm these outcomes ; for example , a disagreement in the correlation analysis between the lvd data on muon flux and the dama ( 26 ) kev residuals with a confidence level greater than 99.9% has been reported in ref . , where it has been shown that they differ in their power spectrum , phase , and amplitude .    in particular , the expected phase for dm",
    "is significantly different than the expected phase of muon flux at gran sasso : in fact , while the first one is always about 152.5 day of the year , the second one is related to the variations of the atmospheric temperature above the site location , @xmath194 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath194 at the lngs location as function of time has been determined e.g. in ref . ;",
    "as first order approximation @xmath194 was fitted with a cosinusoidal behaviour and the phase turned out to be ( 24 june @xmath136 0.4 days ) @xcite ( this is later than e.g. the middle of june , date which is still @xmath195 far away from the dama measured phase , see fig .",

    "in addition , fitting the temperature values at laquila in the years 1990 - 2011 @xcite with a cosinusoidal function , a period of @xmath196 days and a phase of ( 25 july @xmath136 0.6 days ) are obtained @xcite .",
    "thus , in conclusion , in addition to the previously mentioned arguments , also the phase of the dama annual modulation signal @xcite is significantly different than the phases of the surface temperature and of the @xmath194 , on which the muon flux measured deep underground is dependent , and than the phases of the muon flux measured by macro , lvd and borexino experiments .",
    "the above arguments also holds for every kind of cosmogenic product ( even hypothetical exotics ) due to muons @xcite .",

    "the phase of muons and of whatever ( even hypothetical ) muon - induced effect is inconsistent with the phase of the dama annual modulation effect .",
    "in addition to the previous arguments , the direct interaction of muons crossing the dama set - ups can not give rise to any appreciable variation of the measured rate .",
    "in fact , the exposed nai(tl ) surface of dama / libra is about 0.13 m@xmath8 ( and smaller in the former dama / nai ) ; thus the total muon flux in the @xmath10 250 kg dama / libra set - up is about 2.5 muons / day ; moreover , the impinging muons give mainly _ multiple - hits _ events and over the whole energy spectrum .",
    "the order of magnitude of contribution due to the direct interaction of muons crossing the dama set - up has been estimated by a montecarlo calculation @xcite where three topologies of the detectors ( depending on their locations in the @xmath213 dama / libra detectors matrix ) have been considered ( see fig .",

    "in addition , as mentioned above , this contribution would also fail some requirements of the dm annual modulation signature .",
    "the surviving muons and the muon - induced cascades or showers can be sources of neutrons in the underground laboratory .",
    "such neutrons produced by cosmic rays are substantially harder ( extending up to several hundreds mev energies @xcite ) than those from environmental radioactivity ; their typical flux is about @xmath215 neutrons / cm@xmath8/s @xcite , that is three orders of magnitude smaller than the neutron flux produced by radioactivity .",
    "in particular , the fast neutron rate produced by muons interaction is given by : @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the effective mass where muon interactions can give rise to events detected in the dama set - up and @xmath219 is the integral neutron yield , which is normally quoted in neutrons per muon per g / cm@xmath8 of the crossed target material .",
    "the integral neutron yield critically depends on the chemical composition and on the density of the medium through which the muons interact ( see e.g. ref . and refs .",
    "therein for more details ) .",
    "the modulation amplitude of the _ single - hit _ events in the lowest energy region induced in dama / libra by a muon flux modulation can be estimated according to :    @xmath220 ,    where @xmath221 is a geometrical factor , @xmath222 is the detection efficiency for neutrons , @xmath223 is the acceptance of the considered energy window ( e @xmath224 2 kev ) , @xmath225 is the _ single - hit _ efficiency and 1.5% is the muon modulation amplitude @xcite . since @xmath226 250 kg , @xmath227 4 kev , assuming the very cautious values : @xmath228 and taking for @xmath218 the total mass of the heavy shield , 15 ton , one obtains :    @xmath229",

    "in fact , because of the poissonian fluctuation on the number of muons , the standard deviation , @xmath231 , of any hypothetically induced ( 26 ) kev _ single - hit _ modulation amplitude would be much larger than measured by dama , thus , giving rise to no statistically - significant effect ( see ref . ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath231 is expected to be ( much ) larger than @xmath232 cpd / kg / kev for any possible ( known and exotic ) contribution of muons , as demonstrated in ref . .",

    "in particular considering the branching ratios of the ec processes in the @xmath244i decay , the @xmath247-shell contribution ( around 30 kev ) must be about 8 times larger than that of @xmath4-shell ; while no modulation has been observed by dama above 6 kev ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) and , in particular , around 30 kev .",

    "auger electrons have lower probability to be detected by closer detectors ; * the annual modulation signal  observed by dama ",
    "is equally distributed over all the detectors @xcite ; see also the previous considerations .",

    "the necessity for a large modulation fraction ( @xmath265 ) in corollary model dependent interpretation of the dama result has been claimed in refs . .    in particular , in ref .",
    "is claimed that the presence of @xmath57k also at @xmath266 ppb level poses a challenge to any interpretation of the dama results in terms of a dark matter model , requiring a 20% modulation fraction or more ; these papers contain several erroneous claims already confuted by dama coll.@xcite . on the contrary of what is claimed in ref . , the obtained dama model independent evidence is compatible with a wide set of scenarios regarding the nature of the dark matter candidate and related astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics ( see sect . [ compatibility ] and literature ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the procedure used by dama in the model - dependent analyses accounts for all the experimental information carried out by the data . in particular a maximum likelihood ,",
    "ml , procedure is used ; the ml function can be defined as the product of the ml functions for single energy bin given in eq .",
    "[ eq : likelihood ] : @xmath267 we remind that @xmath145 is the number of events collected in the @xmath103-th time interval ( hereafter 1 day ) , by the @xmath104-th detector and in the @xmath82-th energy bin , and @xmath268 m_j \\delta t_i \\delta e \\epsilon_{jk}$ ] is its expectation . since @xmath154 and @xmath155 depend on the theoretical scenario ( dm candidate , astrophysical parameters , ... ) * l * will be a function of all these parameters , generally indicated as @xmath269 , and of the whole @xmath270 and @xmath145 sets , shortly indicated as @xmath271 and @xmath115 , respectively : @xmath272 .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters @xmath271 and @xmath269 are obtained by maximizing *",
    "l * for a given set of observations , @xmath115 , or by minimizing the function @xmath273 , with @xmath274 chosen so as to have @xmath275 . in the minimization procedure @xmath276 a cautious estimate of each detector background .",
    "thus , this maximum likelihood procedure requires the agreement : i ) of the expectations for the modulated part of the signal with the measured modulated behavior for each detector and for each energy bin ; ii ) of the expectations for the unmodulated component of the signal with respect to the measured differential energy distribution for each detector .",
    "a visual indication can be found in ref . , where the cumulative energy spectrum over the 25 detectors has been reported up to 10 kev , just as an example , showing that there was room for a sizeable constant part of the signal : namely @xmath277 cpd / kg / kev in the ( 24 ) kev energy region , considering the measured @xmath253k residual contamination in the crystals and the remaining background estimated from the data behaviours in the energy region up to @xmath278 kev , requiring consistency with the behaviour of each detector . since the measured modulation amplitude ( @xmath162 ) is around @xmath214 cpd",
    "/ kg / kev , there is no reason to claim the necessity to have `` a 20% modulation fraction or more '' .",
    "moreover , the necessity for a large modulation fraction ( @xmath265 ) claimed in ref .",
    "is based on the erroneous assumption of a 0.85 cpd / kg / kev flat background in the ( 27 ) kev energy region .",
    "this approach is completely arbitrary because it is not based on a knowledge of the background contributions , but it is the result of a fitting procedure  among others  also based on incorrect hypotheses , as discussed in ref . .",
    "in the approach followed by the dama experiments , the dark matter annual modulation signature , the experimental observable is not s@xmath74 , but the modulation amplitude , s@xmath86 , as a function of energy .",
    "thus , the dark matter annual modulation approach does not require any identification of s@xmath74 from the total _ single - hit _ counting rate , in order to establish the presence of dm particles in the galactic halo .",
    "thus , such signature allows one to overcome the large uncertainties associated to the exploitation of many data selections / subtractions / statistical - discrimination procedures , to the modeling of surviving background in kev region and to the _ a priori _ assumption on the nature and interaction type of the dm particle(s ) , which affect other approaches .",
    "in particular , as already mentioned e.g. in ref . , a precise modeling of background in the kev region counting rate is always unlikely because e.g. of ( i ) the limitation of montecarlo simulations at very low energies ; ( ii ) the fact that often just upper limits for residual contaminants are available ( and thus the real amount is unknown ) ; ( iii ) the unknown location of each residual contaminant in each component of the set - up ; ( iv ) the possible presence of non - standard contaminants , generally unaccounted ; ( v ) etc .. in conclusion , this explains why the conclusions derived from some fitting procedures used in ref .",
    "are untenable .",
    "finally , just for completeness , let us note that in any case scenarios and dark matter candidates exist which can provide relatively large modulation fraction as well ( see f.i . ref . ) .      the possible contribution to the ( 26 ) kev _ single - hit _ events from delayed phosphorescent pulses induced by the muon interaction in the nai(tl ) crystals , as proposed in ref .",

    "the _ single - hit _ modulation amplitude measured in dama / libra in the ( 26 ) kev energy interval is instead @xcite : @xmath281 @xcite .",
    "thus , the number of muons is too low to allow a similar effect to contribute to the dama observed amplitude ; in fact , to give rise to the dama measured modulation amplitude each @xmath249 should give rise to about 270 _ single - hit _ correlated events in the ( 26 ) kev energy range in a relatively short period @xcite .",
    "such an hypothesis would imply dramatic consequences for every nai(tl ) detector at sea level ( where the @xmath249 flux is @xmath282 times larger than deep underground at lngs ) , precluding its use in nuclear and particle physics . moreover ,",
    "phosphorescence pulses ( as afterglows ) are single and spare photoelectrons with very short time decay ( @xmath1110 ns ) ; they appear as `` isolated '' uncorrelated spikes . on the other side , scintillation events are the sum of correlated photoelectrons following the typical time distribution with mean time equal to the scintillation decay time ( @xmath11240 ns )",
    ". pulses with short time structure are already identified and rejected in the noise rejection procedure described in detail , e.g. in ref .",
    "( the information on the pulse profile is recorded ) .",
    "thus , in addition , phosphorescence pulses are not present in the dama annual modulation data .    furthermore , because of the poissonian fluctuation on the number of muons , the standard deviation of the ( 26 ) kev _ single - hit _",
    "modulation amplitude due to an effect of hypothetical phosphorescence induced by muons would be 13 times larger than that measured by dama ( see ref . ) and therefore no statistically - significant effect , produced by any correlated events , could be singled out . even just this argument is enough to discard the hypothesis of ref .",
    "( similar considerations are also reported in ref . ) .",

    "form factor : it depends on the target nucleus ; there is not a universal formulation for it , many profiles are available in literature . in these profiles",
    "some parameters  whose value is not fixed  appear . in case of sd interaction",
    "there is no decoupling between nuclear and dm particles degrees of freedom and it depends on adopted nuclear potential .",
    "the form factor profiles can differ by order of magnitude ; the value strongly affects the expected signal and the model dependent interpretation of the results . *",
    "spin factor : in the sd interaction it is a crucial quantity .",
    "it depends on the nuclear potential@xcite .",
    "in fact , not only large differences in the measured rate can be expected for target nuclei sensitive to the sd component of the interaction ( such as e.g. @xmath55na and @xmath56i ) with respect to those largely insensitive to such a coupling ( such as e.g. @xmath57ge and @xmath57si ) , but also when using different target nuclei , although all  in principle  sensitive to such a coupling .",
    "large differences exist in different models and even within the same model , as the case e.g. of @xmath55na and @xmath56i , having a proton as unpaired nucleon , and @xmath58si , @xmath59ge , @xmath60xe , @xmath61xe , having a neutron as unpaired nucleon , where the sensitivities are almost complementary , depending on the @xmath62 value ( ratio between the neutron and the proton effective sd coupling strengths ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "* scaling law : the experimental observable in direct detection when searching for scatterings of dm particles on target nuclei is the nucleus cross section of the interaction ; a scaling law for the cross sections is required in order to compare the results obtained by using different target nuclei .",
    "for example , it has been proposed that two - nucleon currents from pion exchange in the nucleus can give different contribution for nuclei with different atomic number @xcite ; as a consequence the cross section for some nuclei can be enhanced with respect to others .",
    "also similar arguments have a great relevance in the model dependent comparisons . * halo model and dm velocity distribution : they are an open problem of the field ( see section [ p : halo ] ) ; the existing uncertainties in these models affect the expected counting rate and they must be taken into account .",
    "moreover an important role , when a dm candidate inducing just nuclear recoils is considered , is played by the quenching factor ( namely the ratio between the detected energy in kev electron equivalent [ kevee ] and the kinetic energy of the recoiling nucleus in kev ) .",
    "as is widely known , the quenching factor is a specific property of the employed detector(s ) and not an universal quantity for a given material .",
    "for example , in liquid noble - gas detectors , it depends  among other aspects  on the level of trace contaminants which can vary in time and from one liquefaction process to another , on the cryogenic microscopic conditions , etc . ; in bolometers it depends for instance on specific crystal properties , trace contaminants , cryogenic conditions , etc . of each specific detector , while generally it is assumed very favorably exactly equal to unity . in crystal scintillators , the quenching factor depends , for example , on the dopant concentration , on the growing method / procedures , on residual trace contaminants , etc . , and is expected to have an energy dependence @xcite .",
    "channeling can play a role too .",
    "thus , all these aspects are relevant sources of uncertainties when interpreting and/or comparing whatever result in terms of dm candidates inducing just nuclear recoils .",
    "the precise determination of the quenching factor is quite difficult for all kinds of used detectors .",
    "in fact , generally the direct measurements of quenching factors are performed with reference detectors , that in some cases can have features quite different from the detectors used in the running conditions ; in some other cases , these quenching factors are even not measured at all . moreover ,",
    "the real nature of these measurements and the used neutron beam / sources may not point out all the possible contributions or instead may cause uncertainties because e.g. of the presence of spurious effects due to interactions with dead materials as e.g. housing or cryogenic assembling , different electronic assembling ( light response , energy threshold , energy resolution , etc . ) ; therefore , they are intrinsically more uncertain than generally quoted .    in particular , the values of quenching factors for na and i , used by dama in the corollary model - dependent analyses concerning candidates inducing just nuclear recoils had , as a first reference , the values measured in ref .",
    "this measurement was performed with a small nai(tl ) crystal from the same growth of the used detectors , irradiated by a @xmath294cf source , by applying the same method previously employed in ref . where quenching factors equal to @xmath295 for na and @xmath296 for i ( integrated over the 5100 kev and the 40300 kev nuclear recoil energy range , respectively ) were obtained .",
    "using the same parameterization as in ref .",
    ", dama measured in ref .",
    "quenching factors equal to 0.30 for na and 0.09 for i , integrated over the 6.597 kev and the 22330 kev nuclear recoil energy ranges ( corresponding approximately to the 230 kev electron equivalent range for both cases ) , respectively .",
    "the associated errors derived from the data were quoted as one unity in the least significant digit ; then , considering also both the large variation available in the literature@xcite and the use of a test detector , a 20% associated error has been included , when deriving corollary model dependent results .    in ref . has been pointed out that the quenching factors for nuclear recoils in scintillators can be described by a semi - empirical formula having only one free parameter : the birks constant , @xmath297 , which depends on the specific set - up . applying this procedure to the dama detectors operating underground and fixing the @xmath297 parameter to the value able to reproduce the light response to alpha particles in these detectors ,",
    "the expected na and i quenching factors are established as a function of the energy with values ranging from 0.65 to 0.55 and from 0.35 to 0.17 in the 2100 kev electron equivalent energy interval for na and i nuclear recoils , respectively .",
    "these considerations point out the energy dependence of quenching factors for various recoiling ions in the same detector and they have called our attention to the fact that the large uncertainties in the method of ref",
    ". could be due , in a significant part , to uncertainties in the parameterization itself , which we also adopted .",
    "moreover , an increase of the quenching factors towards lower energies can be expected@xcite , as observed in some crystal detectors as e.g. csi ; therefore , the use of an integrated value of the quenching factor in the interpretation and in the comparison of results is another source of uncertainty .",
    "an additional argument on uncertainties of quenching factors in crystals ( as also is nai(tl ) ) is the presence and the amount of the well known channeling effect of low energy ions along the crystallographic axes and planes of the crystals .",
    "such an effect can have a significant impact in the corollary model dependent analyses , in addition to the uncertainties discussed above , since a fraction of the nuclear recoil events would have a much larger quenching factor than that derived from the neutron calibrations . since the channeling effect can not be reliably pointed out in usual neutron measurements , as discussed in details in ref .",
    ", generally just theoretical modeling can be applied . in particular ,",
    "the modeling of the channeling effect described by dama in ref .",
    "is compatible with the nuclear recoil spectrum measured at neutron beam by some other groups @xcite .",
    "we also mention alternative channeling models , as that of ref . , where larger probabilities of the planar channeling are expected . for completeness",
    ", we mention the analytical calculation claiming that the channeling effect holds for nuclear recoils coming from outside a crystal and not from nuclear recoils produced inside it , due to the blocking effect @xcite ; nevertheless , although some amount of blocking effect may be present , the precise description of the crystal lattice with dopant and trace contaminants is quite difficult and analytical calculations require some simplifications which affect the result .",
    "all these arguments hold also for the measurement recently reported in ref .",
    ", where a decrease of the quenching factor for na and i recoils at lower energy has been obtained in a specific detector ; in these measurements absence of significant channeling effect in nai(tl ) for low energy nuclear recoils is also claimed .",
    "it is worth noting that , for the reasons reported above , also in these results uncertainties are present : i ) the quenching factor values can be different in different crystals ( see e.g. ref . and references therein ) ; ii ) no @xmath298 light yield has been measured for the used nai(tl ) crystal for comparison ; iii ) efficiency for low energy nuclear recoils in the set - up ; iv ) etc .. thus , it is not methodologically correct to apply these results to whatever nai(tl ) detector",
    ".    obviously , as mentioned above , similar or even larger uncertainties exist on the quenching factor values adopted in the dm direct detection field for whatever kind of detector ( see e.g. ref . ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "there are a lot of relevant sources of uncertainties when interpreting and/or comparing whatever result in terms of dm candidates inducing just nuclear recoils .",
    "more generally , each interpretation of experimental results is affected by the uncertainties due to the models and the considered scenarios : by the fact , no unique nor `` standard '' nor `` reference '' scenario ( as sometimes is claimed in literature ) is available . in this view",
    "the comparisons of the results obtained by different experiments using different target materials and/or different experimental approaches are very complicate and the uncertainties must be taken into account ( see for example refs . where the case of _ wimps _ is discussed at some extent ) .",
    "moreover , it is worth noting that  in every case  in experiments using discrimination procedures the result will not be the identification of the presence of dm particle elastic scatterings because of the known existing nuclear recoil - like indistinguishable background which can hardly be estimated at the needed level of precision .",
    "finally , the electromagnetic component of the counting rate , rejected in this approach , can contain the signal or part of it and will be lost by them .    as examples of the above discussion ,",
    "let us comment few aspects about some activities that recently released results .",
    "the xenon project realized so far two set - ups : xenon10 and xenon100 , using dual phase liquid / gas detectors .",
    "experiments exploiting such technique , like warp and zeplin ( both ended ) , and ctf - dark - side , perform statistical discrimination between nuclear recoil - like candidates and electromagnetic component of the measured counting rate through the ratio of the prompt scintillation signal ( @xmath299 ) and the delayed signal ( @xmath300 ) due to drifted electrons in the gaseous phase , but after many subtraction procedures and definition of a `` fiducial volume '' although e.g. the non - uniform far uv light response .",
    "the xenon100 experiment has released so far data for a total exposure of 224.6 days , using a fiducial volume of only 34 kg of xenon target mass @xcite .",
    "the experiment starts from a relevant counting rate and , in order to try to lower it , needs to apply many data selections , subtractions and handling .",
    "each selection step can introduce systematic errors which can also be variable along the data taking period . after these selections procedures , an analysis based on some discrimination between the electromagnetic radiation and nuclear recoiling candidates is applied ,",
    "although the two populations of events are mostly overlapped in the few available calibration data .",
    "concerns are discussed in literature about the real response of such devices , as e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the technical performance of the apparata , confirmed also by similar experiments , has shown that : i ) the detectors suffer from non - uniformity ; some corrections are applied and systematics must be accounted for ; ii ) the response of these detectors is not linear , i.e. the number of photoelectrons / kev depends on the energy scale and also depends on the applied electric field ; iii ) the physical energy threshold is not proved by source calibrations in the energy interval of interest ; the calibrations are done with external sources and the lowest energy calibration point is 122 kev of @xmath301co ; no calibration is possible at the claimed energy threshold ( as well as e.g. the experimental determination of efficiency ) ; iv ) the use of energy calibration lines from xe activated by neutrons can not be applied as routine and the studies on a possible calibration with internal sources have not been realized so far ; v ) despite of the small light response ( 2.28 photoelectron / kevee ) , absence of calibration in the region of interest and non - uniform light response , an energy threshold at 1.3 kevee is claimed ; vi ) the energy resolution is poor ; vii ) in the scale - up of the detectors the performances deteriorate ; viii ) the behaviour of the light yield for nuclear recoils at low energy is uncertain .",
    "two events survive after the applied corrections and the cuts procedures , corresponding to 224.6 kg@xmath98day exposure ; the quoted estimated background is @xmath302 events @xcite .    in",
    "the double read - out bolometric technique , the heat signal and the ionization signal are used in order to discriminate between electromagnetic events and nuclear recoil - like events .",
    "this technique is used by cdms and edelweiss collaborations . in particular",
    ", cdms - ii detector consists of 19 ge bolometer of about 230 g each one and 11 si bolometer of about 100 g each one .",
    "the experiment released data for an exposure of about 190 kg @xmath98 day @xcite using only 10 ge detectors in the analysis ( discarding all the data collected with the other ones ) and considering selected time periods for each detector .",
    "edelweiss employs a target fiducial mass of about 2 kg of ge and has released data for an exposure of 384 kg @xmath98 day collected in two different periods ( july - nov 08 and april 09-may 10 ) @xcite with a 17% reduction of exposure due to run selection .",
    "these two experiments claim to have an `` event by event '' discrimination between _ noise + electromagnetic background _ and _ nuclear recoil + recoil - like _ ( neutrons , end - range alphas , fission fragments , ... ) events by comparing the bolometer and the ionizing signals for each event , but their results are , actually , largely based on several kinds of huge data selections and on the application of other preliminary rejection procedures which are generally poorly described and often not completely quantified .",
    "an example is the time cut analysis used to remove the so - called surface electrons that are distributed in the electromagnetic band and in the nuclear recoiling one , spanning from low to high energy .",
    "no detailed discussion about the stability and the robustness of the reconstruction procedure has been given ; a look - up table to identify such event is used but systematical errors on the stability in time of such table are not discussed . in these experiments",
    "few nuclear recoil - like events survive the cuts and selection procedures applied in the data analysis ; these events are generally assumed in terms of background . in particular , for the cdms - ii case",
    "two events survive after the cuts and selection procedures , while the quoted estimated background is @xmath303 events @xcite .",
    "moreover , most efficiencies and physical quantities entering in the interpretation of the claimed selected events have never been suitably addressed .",
    "in addition , further uncertainties are present when , as done in some cases , a neutron background modeling is pursued . as regards their application to the search for time dependence of the data ( such as the annual modulation signature ) , it would require  among others  to face the objective difficulty to control all the operating conditions  at the needed level ( @xmath248 1% )  despite the required periodical procedures e.g. for cooling and for calibration source introduction .",
    "moreover , the many applied cuts and the discrimination procedures exclude the possibility to obtain the needed stability for a reliable annual modulation analysis .",
    "the attempt performed by cdms - ii to search for annual modulation in ge target has been done by using only 8 detectors over 30 , by selecting events in the nuclear recoil band below the 10 kev energy threshold ( actually between 5 and 12 kev ) and by using data that are not continuous over the whole annual periods considered in the analysis @xcite .",
    "the use of non - overlapping time periods collected with detectors having background rate within the signal box that differ orders of magnitude can not allow one to get safely reliable result ( see e.g. arguments in ref . ) .",
    "recently , the results of cdms - ii with the si detectors were published in two close - in - time data releases @xcite ; while no events in six detectors ( corresponding exposure of 55.9 kg@xmath98day before analysis cuts ) were reported in the former @xcite , three events in eight detectors ( corresponding raw exposure of 140.2 kg@xmath98day ) were reported over the residual background , estimated after subtraction : @xmath304 in the second one @xcite . the latter result may be interpreted  under certain assumptions  in terms of a dm candidate with spin - independent interaction and a mass around 10 gev .",
    "this is compatible with interpretations of the dm annual modulation result already reported by dama in terms of this kind of dm candidate and with the other hints reported by cresst and cogent ( see later ) .",
    "the cresst experiment exploits the double read - out bolometric technique , using the heat signal due to an interacting particle in the cawo@xmath63 crystals and the scintillation light produced .",
    "a statistical discrimination of nuclear recoil - like events from electromagnetic radiation is performed .",
    "the detector is placed in the gran sasso laboratory .",
    "the last data , released by the experiment , have been collected with 8 detectors of 300 g each one , for an exposure of about 730 kg @xmath98 day @xcite . as regards the cuts and selection procedures applied , most of the above discussion also holds .",
    "after selections , 67 nuclear recoil - like events have been observed in the oxygen band . the background contribution estimated by authors ranges from 37 to 43 events , and does not account for all the observed events .",
    "the remaining number of events and their energy distribution may be interpreted  under certain assumptions  in terms of a dm candidate with spin - independent interaction and a mass in the range of 10 - 30 gev .",
    "this is compatible with interpretations of the annual modulation result already reported by dama in terms of this kind of dm candidate and with the possible hints reported by cogent ( see later ) and cdms - ii .",
    "improvements in the radiopurity of the set - up are planned , in order to reduce known source of background .",
    "future results are foreseen .",
    "other possible positive hints of a possible signal of light dark matter candidates inducing nuclear elastic scatterings have been reported by the cogent experiment @xcite .",
    "the set - up is composed by a 440 g , p - type point contact ( ppc ) ge diode , with a very low energy threshold at 0.4 kevee .",
    "it is located in the soudan underground laboratory . in the data analysis",
    "no discrimination between electromagnetic radiation and nuclear recoils is applied ; only noise events are rejected .",
    "the experiment observes more events than they expect from an estimate of the background in the energy range 0.4 - 3.2 kevee .",
    "the energy spectrum of these events is compatible  under certain assumptions  with a signal produced by the interaction of a dm particle with a mass around 10 gev .",
    "in addition , considering an exposure of 146 kg @xmath98 days cogent experiment also reports an evidence at about 2.8@xmath52 c.l . of an annual modulation of the counting rate in ( 0.5 - 0.9 ) kevee with phase and period compatible  although the small confidence level  with a dark matter signal .    in conclusion",
    ", the comparison of the results achieved by different experiments must be handled with very cautious attitude without neglecting the many sources of uncertainties .",
    "this holds both for the model dependent allowed regions and exclusion plots .",
    "in particular , both the negative results and the possible positive hints above  mentioned are largely compatible with the model independent annual modulation results of dama in many scenarios , also considering the large uncertainties in theoretical and experimental aspects .",
    "the same consideration can be done for the possible positive hints and the null results from the indirect approaches .",
    "anyhow , let us remind that  as already stated in sect .",
    "[ compatibility ]  the obtained model independent evidence of dama is compatible with a wide set of existing scenarios regarding the nature of the dm candidate and related astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics .",
    "as shown in fig . [ fg : tem ] , in order to increase the experimental sensitivity of dama / libra and to disentangle  in the corollary investigation on the candidate particle(s )  at least some of the many possible astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics scenarios and related experimental and theoretical uncertainties , the decreasing of the software energy threshold is necessary . for this purpose",
    "an upgrade at the end of 2010 has been performed , replacing all the pmts with new ones having higher quantum efficiency ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_pmts ] ) . after this upgrade ,",
    "dama / libra started its data taking and is continuously running in this new configuration , named dama / libra  phase2 , since january 2011 .",
    "details on the reached performances are reported in ref . .",
    "among the perspectives of dama / libra  phase2 we recall : 1 ) the increase of the experimental sensitivity by lowering the software energy threshold of the experiment ; 2 ) the improvement of the corollary investigation on the nature of the dark matter particle and related astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics arguments ; 3 ) the investigation of other signal features and second order effects ; 4 ) the improvement of the sensitivity in the investigation of several rare processes other than dark matter ( as done by the dama / nai @xcite and by dama / libra ",
    "phase1 @xcite ) .",
    "this requires long and heavy full time dedicated work for reliable collection and analysis of very large exposures , as dama collaboration has always done .",
    "the strictly quality control allows dama / libra to be still the highest radiopure set - up in the field with the largest exposed full sensitive mass , the full control of running conditions , the largest duty - cycle and an exposure orders of magnitude larger than any other activity in the field .",
    "some of the main topics , that will be addressed by dama / libra  phase2 , are :    * _ the velocity and spatial distribution of the dark matter particles in the galactic halo_. * _ the effects induced on the dark matter particles distribution in the galactic halo by contributions from satellite galaxies tidal streams_. it has been pointed out @xcite that contributions to the dark matter particles in the galactic halo should be expected from tidal streams from the sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy . considering that this galaxy was undiscovered until 1994 and considering galaxy formation theories",
    ", one has to expect that also other satellite galaxies do exist and contribute as well . in the recent years",
    "other streams of stars and gases have been pointed out both in the milky way and in nearby galaxies as m31 . at present",
    "the data available for the kinematics of these streams are few , but  as previously mentioned  in next years important advancements could be expected from the data of the gaia satellite @xcite , whose aim is the measurement of distances and photometric data of millions of stars in the milky way . at present ,",
    "the best way to investigate the presence of a stream contribution is to determine in accurate way the phase of the annual modulation , @xmath305 , as a function of the energy ; in fact , for a given halo model @xmath305 would be expected to be ( slightly ) different from 152.5 d and to vary with energy @xcite . * _ the effects induced on the dark matter particles distribution in the galactic halo by the possible existence of caustics_. it has been shown that the continuous infall of dark matter particles in the galactic gravitational field can form caustic surfaces and discrete streams in the dark matter particles halo @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology to point out a similar scenario is analogous to that in the previous item ; thus , dama / libra can as well test this possibility . *",
    "_ the detection of possible `` solar wakes''_. as an additional verification of the possible presence of contributions from streams of dark matter particles in our galactic halo , dama / libra can investigate also the gravitational focusing effect of the sun on the dark matter particle of a stream .",
    "in fact , one should expect two kinds of enhancements in the dark matter particles flow : one named `` spike '' , which gives an enhancement of dark matter particle density along a line collinear with the direction of the incoming stream and of the sun , and another , named `` skirt '' , which gives a larger dark matter particle density on a surface of cone whose opening angle depends on the stream velocity .",
    "thus , dama / libra will investigate such a possibility with high sensitivity through second - order time - energy correlations .",
    "* _ the study of possible structures as clumpiness with small scale size_. possible structures as clumpiness with small scale size could , in principle , be pointed out by exploiting a large exposure which can be collected by dama / libra . * _ the coupling(s ) of the dark matter particle with the @xmath55na , @xmath56i and electrons and its nature_. as mentioned , several uncertainties are linked to the coupling(s ) between the dark matter particle and the ordinary matter .",
    "the exploiting of a new large exposure will allow to better constrain the related aspects .",
    "* _ the investigation of possible diurnal effects_. the possible sidereal diurnal effects can be due to the earth rotation velocity , to the shadow of the earth ( sensitive just to dm candidates with high cross sections and tiny density ) , and to channeling effects in case of dm particle inducing nuclear recoils .",
    "dama / libra can also put more stringent constraints on these aspects . *",

    "the 8.9@xmath52 c.l .",
    "positive dm model independent result , already achieved so far by dama / nai and dama / libra  phase1 , is a reference point .",
    "it is compatible with many dm scenarios and , in particular , with the possible positive hints recently put forward by activities exploiting other target - materials and/or other approaches ; on the other hand , negative results achieved by applying many subtractions and corrections procedures are not in robust conflict .",
    "the same is for possible model dependent positive hints and null results from indirect approaches .",
    "the data of the last annual cycle of dama / libra  phase1 will soon be released . at the end of dama / libra  phase1 ( end of 2010 )",
    "an important upgrade has been performed , replacing all the pmts with new ones having higher quantum efficiency to increase the experimental sensitivity lowering the software energy threshold of the experiment .",
    "another upgrade at the end of 2012 was successfully concluded , while further improvements are planned . since january 2011",
    "the dama / libra experiment is in data taking with the new configuration , named dama / libra  phase2 .",
    "a large work will be faced by dama / libra  phase2 , which is by the fact the intrinsically most sensitive experiment in the field of dark matter because of its radiopurity , full sensitive exposed mass , full control of running conditions and high duty cycle .",
    "these qualities will also allow dama / libra to further investigate with higher sensitivity several dm features , second order effects , and other rare processes .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the memory of prof .",
    "d. prosperi , one of the proponents of dama and a great friend , mentor and colleague until his death in 2010 .",
    "his outstanding work has left to us and to everyone who met him the passion and the enthusiasm for physics and a model of high cultural and human values .",
