    "employing static or laser fields , along with the tuning of the interaction strength by visiting feshbach resonances , allows us to prepare and explore weakly or strongly correlated quantum systems in almost arbitrary potential landscapes @xcite .",
    "in particular , the flexible experimental toolbox of optical lattices enabled the investigation of the phase transition from a coherent superfluid ( sf ) to a mott - insulator ( mi ) state with localized particles in each site @xcite , studied theoretically by the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) @xcite .",
    "further highlights include quantum phases like bose glass and mott - shells , occurring for disordered , confined and incommensurate systems @xcite .",
    "tuning appropriately the laser beams it is possible to effectively decrease the dimensionality of the system and explore intrinsic phenomena of quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , where the so - called confinement - induced resonances resulting from the change of the transverse length scale @xcite can be utilized to alter the interaction strength .",
    "this way , it became experimentally feasible to investigate weak to strongly interacting systems and especially the extreme case of the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas , a state of strongly correlated bosonic matter intrinsically tied to 1d physics @xcite where bosons that repel each other with infinitely strong forces can be mapped to non - interacting fermions @xcite .",
    "not only the special features of such a gas have attracted theoretical studies @xcite but also the crossover to this limit from 3d to 1d @xcite .",
    "while the analytical treatment of the interaction crossover in 1d from uncorrelated to tg - gas is possible for a homogeneous system with periodic @xcite or hard - wall @xcite boundary conditions , the exact study of bosonic systems exposed to specific trapping geometries is particular for a small number of particles .",
    "the harmonic trap @xcite and the double well @xcite are paradigm systems which unveil characteristic features of this crossover in confined geometries . broadening and immergence of oscillations of the densities , as well as the evolution of the coherence properties have been examined in detail .",
    "1d optical lattices are very special and appealing systems since they combine the physics in a lattice ( phase transitions ) with the special features of one dimension @xcite .",
    "localization , delocalisation as well as lattice imperfection effects have been studied for small ensembles @xcite showing interesting analogies with macroscopic phases . in particular momentum distributions , pair correlations and energy spectra give insight to the mi - sf transition with increasing lattice depth or unveil the effect of an incommensurate filling , while a bose - glass phase emerges when breaking the lattice symmetry .",
    "the effect of a higher filling factor and the subsequent on - site fragmentation of particles in periodic 1d lattices has been explored in @xcite .",
    "the authors investigate a commensurate case with two particles per site and distinguish between a phase of mi with unperturbed wannier functions , and a second transition to a state with two fragmented orbitals on each site .    in this article",
    "we cover the different interaction regimes from the weakly correlated to the fermionization limit for a few - boson ensemble in a finite one - dimensional lattice .",
    "we go far beyond the bhm regime where the change of the interactions is equivalent to the change of the lattice depth . since commensurability is a key issue concerning the crossover ,",
    "we examine representative few - body setups for commensurate and incommensurate filling factors .",
    "we demonstrate localization mechanisms by examining densities , particle number fluctuations and coherence loss in momentum distributions in the case of a unit filling factor . for higher commensurate filling we observe on - site repulsion effects such as broadening and oscillatory patterns in the densities which go beyond the bose - hubbard regime .",
    "incommensurable setups on the other hand , show the possibility for spatial variations of observables , as a result of the correlations and the finite size of the system , in addition to partial delocalisation due to the incommensurate fraction of particles .",
    "the method which we use here is the multi - configurational time - dependent hartree ( mctdh ) @xcite which has proven to be efficient in treating bosonic systems both for static properties and dynamics ( see appendix ) @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we explain the setup , the analytically describable limits and the approximative methods .",
    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "iii for commensurate and sec .",

    "the effective 1d hamiltonian we consider reads : @xmath0 where the two - body interaction potential is delta - like @xmath1 .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath2 depends on the scattering length @xmath3 and the oscillator length @xmath4 which characterises the transverse confinement : @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the one - body part of the hamiltonian @xmath6 contains the 1d- lattice potential @xmath7 , characterised by the depth @xmath8 and periodicity @xmath9 ( distance between two successive minima ) setting @xmath10 . in order to restrict the infinite potential @xmath7 to a finite number of sites @xmath11 and a length @xmath12",
    ", we impose hard - wall boundary conditions on appropriate position . in our calculations , for numerical convenience",
    "( keeping a standard grid ) , the length unit is @xmath13 and the energy unit is chosen as @xmath14 setting also @xmath15 .",
    "the rescaled scattering strength is thus @xmath16 . in units of the recoil energy @xmath17 it reads @xmath18 .",
    "all the parameters are considered to be tunable almost at will in corresponding experiments . for the interaction strength",
    "@xmath19 we take representative values to cover the complete crossover to fermionization in all different cases of commensurability .",
    "we use a sufficiently large lattice depth ( @xmath20 which is of the order of @xmath21 depending on @xmath22 ) such that at least two single particle bands lie energetically below the continuum for reasons we explain later on .",
    "the way we render our system finite via imposing hard - wall boundaries does not restrict the generality of our treatment and results .",
    "in particular , independently of the specific experimental implementation ( using multi - colour lattices and/or harmonic confinement ) , finite systems exhibit intrinsic features which differ from infinite lattices ( periodic boundary conditions ) ; the confined traps result always in spatial inhomogeneities of the densities which are absent in the periodic case . these inhomogeneities can be increased or manipulated if there is a harmonic confinement or a disordered surface .",
    "although we are focusing here on the case of equal on site energies , we observe a rich behaviour that captures the main effects of a finite confined system .",
    "all our numerically exact calculations are performed by the mctdh method ( see appendix for a description ) .",
    "the following subsections referring to the extreme cases of no and infinite interactions , as well as the bose - hubbard model for weak interactions , are valid only in certain regimes which we address in the secs .",
    "iii , iv to explain the observations . covering the complete interaction crossover from @xmath23 to @xmath24 by mctdh we are able to show the regimes of validity but also examine effects going beyond these models .",
    "in order to understand the limit cases of non- and infinitely- interacting particles ( see next subsection ) , a discussion of the single particle states is necessary .",
    "analytical expressions for the delocalised single - particle states , i.e. bloch states , are available for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "for finite lattices , we use the tight - binding approximation assuming only a nearest - neighbour tunneling coupling term @xmath25 between the sites @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are the on - site localised wannier states . within this approximation ,",
    "valid for a relatively deep potential , we express the bloch states in terms of wannier functions .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian written in a matrix form using the localised states basis is :    @xmath29 where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) are the on - site energies , which in our case are equal ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the hard - wall boundary conditions imply that there is no tunnel coupling between the first and the last lattice site as opposed to the periodic ones , where there is a single coupling for all sites .",
    "the resulting eigenvalues are : @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , and the eigenfunctions read : @xmath35 these lowest - band single - particle eigenstates are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the triple well using the gaussian approximation for the wannier functions around the center of each well @xmath36 @xmath37 : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , with corresponding energies @xmath41 .",
    "note that for the ground state the middle well is occupied with a larger amplitude compared to the two outer ones .",
    "for the states of the excited bands the harmonic oscillator orbitals of higher order can serve as localised functions to a rather good approximation .",
    "the computation of the eigenstates , done by numerical diagonalisation of the model hamiltonian @xmath42 is in good agreement with this simple model @xmath43 . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", the single particle states of the lowest band for the case of a lattice with a superimposed parabolic trap were derived analytically within the tight - binding approximation .",
    "the non - interacting and the infinitely strongly interacting case of impenetrable bosons can be both addressed analytically , given that we can solve the corresponding single - particle problem . in the former case",
    ", we just have one orbital for the ground state ( the lowest eigenstate of the single - particle hamiltonian ) where all bosons reside @xmath44 . in the tonks - girardeau limit",
    ", the bose - fermi map @xcite establishes the following isomorphy between the bosonic @xmath45 and the non - interacting fermionic wave function @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , the infinitely interacting bosonic ground state is simply the absolute value of the fermionic one .",
    "the local densities are appropriate tools for analysing a many body state @xmath50 : the one body density @xmath51 , diagonal kernel of the one - body density operator @xmath52 , and the two body density @xmath53 diagonal kernel of the two - body density operator @xmath54 . in the tg limit",
    "they are equal to the fermionic ones : @xmath55 @xmath56 accordingly the ground state energy in the fermionization limit is @xmath57 .",
    "bosons in optical lattices have bee mostly studied in the literature within the bose - hubbard model @xcite , employing the tight - binding and lowest band approximation .",
    "apart from the coupling term @xmath58 and the on - site energies @xmath59 introduced in @xmath43 , there is additionally on - site interaction with strength @xmath60 which reads for a delta contact potential @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 indicates the sum over nearest neighbours .",
    "both parameters @xmath58 and @xmath60 can be tuned by the lattice constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "increasing for example the laser intensity , the lattice becomes deeper , and thus the ratio @xmath64 increases substantially leading to the mi phase in the commensurate case : the particles save interaction energy by being localised in different wells and the tunneling to neighbouring sites is strongly suppressed .",
    "the sf phase on the other hand , is characterised by phase coherence and delocalisation of the particles .",
    "quantum phase transitions at zero temperature are triggered by quantum fluctuations , and in this sense , we can examine in our few - body ensembles signatures of the mi and sf phase .",
    "we use as a measure of localisation , the local ( on - site ) particle number fluctuations : @xmath65\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the one- and two- body densities respectively , integrated over the lattice site @xmath26 .",
    "the sf - mi transition is accompanied by decreasing and finally vanishing fluctuations @xmath68 as @xmath64 increases ( corresponding in some sense to vanishing local compressibility in the mi phase @xcite ) .",
    "another sign of the transition is the loss of coherence due to the localisation of the particles in individual sites .",
    "this can be observed in the momentum distribution , where the visibility of the interference peaks in the coherent sf phase is reduced , ending up with a smoothened incoherent profile in the mi regime @xcite .    for filling factors higher than one , @xmath69 ,",
    "it is necessary to go beyond the simple bhm , which assumes unperturbed wannier orbitals and is restricted to the lowest band , one has to include higher band effects @xcite to examine the fermionization and generally strong correlation effects .",
    "the bose - fermi map already indicates that the lowest band levels are not sufficient to accommodate a number of fermionized bosons larger than the number of wells .",
    "let us briefly mention effective models relevant for the discussion of filling factors higher than one .",
    "a modulation of the wannier functions to take into account on - site interaction effects has been proposed @xcite or splitting into two orbitals into the same well @xcite .",
    "another recent few - body study suggests to optimise the bhm parameters such that they agree with the exact results specifically in the strongly interacting regime @xcite . besides this , the concept of _ extended fermionization _ valid in the extreme limit of bhm @xmath70 under the assumption that the particles occupy different layers of mi and sf character @xcite gives a valuable picture for situations where an incommensurate fraction of particles sits on a commensurate localised background .",
    "we emphasise that the following results are obtained by the numerically exact mctdh method and we only refer to other models for explanation and comparison .",
    "we explore here firstly the commensurate filling case showing the fingerprints of localization for filling factors @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the latter being particularly interesting for the study of on - site interaction effects with two particles per site .

    "[ fig2](a ) for @xmath23 .",
    "this occurs for setups with hard - wall boundary conditions but is generally characteristic of finite lattices ( independent of the number of sites and particles ) , since the kinetic energy term renders the middle wells energetically more favourable .",
    "we remark that the particles reside all in the same single particle ground state which has indeed the maximal density in the middle : @xmath78 ( see eq . 2 and fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    as the interaction strength increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) , we observe a gradual redistribution of the density which leads to equal population of all sites .",

    "[ fig2](b ) ( inset ) we plot the population of each well , @xmath86 , as a function of the interaction strength .",
    "while for the outer ( @xmath87 ) and middle ( @xmath88 ) wells the population evolves monotonically to the final value , the intermediate wells ( see @xmath89 ) act as a carrier of particles and thus their population may exceed for some intermediate interaction strength ( @xmath90 ) their final one .",

    "@xmath70 we expect them to vanish completely , while in our case they saturate to a small value .",
    "the rather shallow depth of our lattice permits an occupation of the interwell space with a non - zero overlap between particles sitting in neighbouring sites . including this area into the integrations of the one- and two- body density ( eq .",
    "3 ) we end up with a small contribution to the fluctuations even in the strongly interacting limit .",
    "note also that the middle wells ( @xmath88 ) , which can lose population with respect to both sides , keep on having larger fluctuations than the outer ones ( @xmath87 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) we observe that the fluctuations converge to a constant value for @xmath91 .",

    "perfect localisation occurs only when the latter vector is the eigenstate of the system suppressing all other contributions .",
    "let us point out here the effect of the hard wall in comparison with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in our confined system for weak interactions , the fock states with less occupation in the outer wells outweigh those with less occupation in the center and therefore we observe an imbalance of the sites population . in the case of periodic boundary conditions even the non - interacting state possesses a uniform population of the sites due to symmetry .",

    "if one particle sits in one well , any second one distributes itself equally over the other wells , but has zero probability to be in the same well .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     an interesting effect occurs in this case for the one - body density matrix @xmath101 .",
    "the remaining coherence in the strongly interacting limit is only concentrated in the left and the right part of the space ( diagonal squares in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ( a),(b ) ) .",
    "this indicates that the two extra particles , tend to localise with respect to each other since the off - diagonal squares of this plot are completely depleted ; the left is completely uncorrelated with the right part of the space .",
    "apparent is the formation of wiggles in the center of the diagonal for @xmath102 ( fig .  [ fig16](a ) )",
    "along with the formation of fragmented patterns in the remaining off - diagonal contribution .",

    "[ fig16](b ) @xmath103 ) these wiggles are smeared out to an equally broadened profile , while there is a very strongly fragmented pattern in the populated off - diagonal spots .",
    "it is worth comparing this to the fermionization limit with the corresponding @xmath104 case , 2 particles in 4 wells ( fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "the coherence between left and right part of the potential is present in the latter case ( off - diagonal squares retain contribution ) , which means that one particle mainly localised in the left part does penetrate into the right part .",

    "the localisation of the particles in individual wells is pronounced and thus a higher number of delocalised single - particle functions are necessary to express them ."
