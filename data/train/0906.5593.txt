    "the knowledge of the qcd dynamics at high energies is essential in understanding the hadronic interactions studied at current ( hera , tevatron ) and future ( lhc ) accelerators . in the physics of saturation",
    "@xcite the relevant observable is the forward scattering amplitude of a quark - antiquark dipole off a target .",
    "it enters several processes at high energy like deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , photoproduction and hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "its quantum evolution has recently been the object of many studies @xcite .",
    "the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite valid in the large @xmath3 limit and in the mean field approximation provides a tool to study the rapidity behavior of the gluon distribution in a large momentum range including the saturation region where the effects of gluon recombination , taken into account in the non - linear term , become important .",
    "the main features of analytical solutions of bk have been used to parameterize @xcite the unintegrated gluon distribution , @xmath4 , which is the fourier - transform of dipole - target amplitude .",
    "the knowledge of the corresponding nuclear unintegrated gluon distribution is indeed crucial .",
    "it is the basic object required to calculate physical observables in the @xmath5-factorized picture employed by the gluon saturation models . in principle",
    ", @xmath4 possesses a bjorken-@xmath2 dependence determined ( here , @xmath6 ) by nonlinear evolution equations of the cgc theory @xcite and its dependence on transverse momentum @xmath7 is fixed by a characteristic saturation momentum , @xmath8 . in most of cgc approaches , the gluon distribution is suppressed below the saturation scale @xmath9 @xcite compared to the perturbative form @xmath10 .",
    "the physics of dense partonic systems and their non - linear perturbative evolution to higher energy has motivated several attempts at understanding bulk properties of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions such as the multiplicity , rapidity distribution e centrality dependence of particle production @xcite .",
    "notice that saturation effects has been claimed to account for the suppression of the high-@xmath11 hadronic spectra in gold - gold and deuterium - gold collisions at rhic . for the evolved gluon distribution",
    ", the yield of produced gluons in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions at central rapidity can be calculated in the factorized way @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 . under the assumption of local parton - hadron duality ,",
    "the multiplicity in @xmath1 collisions at central rapidity rises proportional to the nuclear saturation scale , @xmath14 @xcite . for collision energies reaching to 5.5 tev , the upcoming program in lead - lead collisions at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the confirmation of the conclusions obtained from rhic is expected to take place .",
    "it is also expected the discrimination between the different physical mechanisms proposed to explain particle production in high energy nuclear reactions . as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , purely empirical parameterizations of multiplicity data of a large variety of colliding systems allow a logarithmic dependence on collision energy .",
    "however , rhic data by themselves do not differentiate between this and other functional forms like power - laws , negating any possibility to usefully constraint the expectations for lhc energies without further theoretical guidance .    in this work",
    "we propose a parameterization for the nuclear gluon distribution based on the numerical / analytical solutions of the bk evolution equation . starting with a a proton target",
    ", we present a parameterization which encodes the main features of analytical solution of bk equation as geometric scaling property and inclusion of sub - leading terms .",
    "it describes all data on dis in the region of @xmath15 in a wide interval of photon virtualities . relying on geometric scaling arguments",
    ", we propose a simple model for the nuclear unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "such a model is then compared to data on nuclear ratio and its relation to saturation models is investigated .",
    "lets start by considering the collision between a virtual photon and a proton at high energy . in a frame where the photon travels fast",
    ", one can consider that it fluctuates into a @xmath16 dipole @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of this dipole being much longer than the time of interaction with the proton , one can write the cross section as a product of the wavefunction for a photon to go into a dipole times the dipole - proton cross section , which leads to usual formula @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dipole - proton cross section",
    ". the transverse and longitudinal photon wavefuctions in this expression are computable in perturbative qed .",
    "the proton structure function @xmath19 can be obtained from the @xmath20 cross section through the relation @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "if one treats the proton as a homogeneous disk of radius @xmath22 , the dipole - proton cross section in eq .",
    "( [ cross_section ] ) is usually taken to be proportional to the dipole - proton forward scattering amplitude @xmath23 through the relation @xmath24 . here , @xmath6 is the rapidity variable .",
    "the bk evolution equation describes the high - energy evolution of the dipole - proton scattering amplitude @xmath25 , where the asymptotic behavior of its solutions is naturally expressed in momentum space .",
    "therefore , the photo - absorption cross section can be written in terms of @xmath4 , the fourier transform of @xmath23 : @xmath26    accordingly , the proton structure function can be expressed in momentum space : @xmath27 where the wavefunction is now expressed in momentum space as well ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . the scattering amplitude @xmath28 , the forward scattering amplitude in momentum space , can be obtained as a numerical result of the bk evolution equation . in case of neglecting its dependence on the impact parameter",
    ", the bk equation can be expressed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the characteristic function of the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) kernel @xcite and we used @xmath32 with @xmath33 some fixed soft scale .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the properties of analytical solutions of bk equation were used to build an analytical expression for @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , the bk equation reduces to the fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( f - kpp ) equation @xcite ( after changing of variables ) when its kernel is approximated in the saddle point approximation _ i.e. _ to second order in the derivative @xmath34 , the so - called diffusive approximation .",
    "the f - kpp equation is a well - known equation in non - equilibrium statistical physics , whose dynamics is used to describe many reaction - diffusion systems in the mean - field approximation .",
    "this equation has been extensively studied recently and , in particular , it is known to admit traveling waves as asymptotic solutions @xcite . at asymptotic rapidities ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath4 , instead of depending separately on @xmath7 and @xmath35 , depends only on the scaling variable @xmath36 , where we have introduced the saturation scale @xmath37 , measuring the position of the wavefront . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a more detailed calculation allows also for the extraction of two additional sub - leading corrections , resulting into the following expression for the tail of the scattering amplitude : @xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 denotes the second derivative of the bfkl kernel with respect to @xmath40 and where the saturation scale contains sub - leading terms .",
    "the critical parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 are obtained from the knowledge of the bfkl kernel alone and correspond to the selection of the slowest possible wave , i.e. @xmath43 . for the lo bfkl kernel , one finds @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    concerning the property of geometric scaling @xcite , when one moves along the saturation line , the behavior of the scattering amplitudes remains unchanged .",
    "in addition , the sub - leading corrections in also play an important role as the last term introduces an explicit dependence on the rapidity @xmath35 and hence violates geometric scaling .",
    "however , this term in negligible when @xmath46 .",
    "this means that geometric scaling is obtained for @xmath47 , i.e. , in a window which extends @xmath48 above the saturation scale .",
    "it is a remarkable property that , at high - energy , the consequences of saturation are observed arbitrarily far in the tail , where @xmath4 is much smaller than 1 .",
    "notice that eq . only gives a description of the tail of the wavefront @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) . in the infrared domain",
    ", one can show that the amplitude behaves like @xmath51 , with @xmath52 being a constant .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , an analytic interpolation between both asymptotic behavior of the amplitude was proposed .",
    "the final expression for the unintegrated gluon function is given by : @xmath53 \\",
    ", \\left[1-\\exp \\left(-t_{\\text{dil}}\\right)\\right].\\ ] ]    this equation is our master formula for the further extrapolation to the nuclear case . in expression above , @xmath54 is an expression which is monotonically decreasing with @xmath55 and which reproduces ( up to the logarithmic factor ) , the amplitude for geometric scaling : @xmath56,\\ ] ] with @xmath57 .",
    "the parameters of model have been determined from a fit of all the last hera measurements of the proton structure function from h1 @xcite , zeus @xcite , with the analysis being restricted to the following kinematic range @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in our numerical analysis we use the fit including charm @xcite ( @xmath60 gev and @xmath61 gev ) , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 gev@xmath65 and @xmath66 gev .",
    "having presented the unintegrated gluon distribution for the nucleon case , in what follows we investigate its extension for nuclear targets relying on geometric scaling properties . based on geometric scaling arguments and on the main features of numerical solutions of bk equation , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is assumed that both the energy and the nuclear size ( or centrality ) dependence on the scattering amplitude @xmath67 can be encoded in the saturation scale @xmath68 for any hadron @xmath69 ( proton or nucleus ) .",
    "then the cross section in eq .",
    "( [ cross_section ] ) can be written as @xmath70    as the wavefunction is proportional to @xmath71 times a function of @xmath72 , the cross section is only a function of @xmath73 .",
    "this geometric scaling was found to describe all lepton - proton data with @xmath15 . in order to compare protons and different nuclei , in ref .",
    "@xcite the following assumption about the impact parameter dependence was considered : it can be scaled by the nuclear radius of the hadronic target @xmath69 , @xmath74 , with @xmath75 fm .",
    "then , the condition for geometric scaling in lepton nucleus data is @xmath76    for the dependence on atomic number , the saturation scale in the nucleus grows with the ratio of the transverse partons densities to some power @xmath77 , which was taken as a free parameter : @xmath78 where @xmath8 is the saturation scale for a proton target . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found @xmath79 , with @xmath80 , which translate into a growth of the nuclear saturation scale faster than @xmath81 for large nuclei .",
    "now , we are ready to construct a model for the unintegrated nuclear gluon distribution . using the geometric scaling arguments",
    ", we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmodel ] ) , by replacing @xmath82 and @xmath83 : @xmath84 \\ , \\left\\ { 1-\\exp \\left[- t_{\\text{dil}}(\\tau_a , y)\\right]\\right\\},\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath85 .",
    "we think this procedure is suitable once it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the data for nuclear structure functions lie on the region where @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the condition @xmath87 is roughly valid and geometric scaling violation should be small . in next section , we investigate the numerical calculation of the nuclear structure function using eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmodela ] ) and compare them to the experimental measurements of the nuclear ratios .     as a function of bjorken-@xmath2 for several nuclear targets .",
    "solid line represents our results ( bm model ) and dot - dashed curves the result of asw model . ]",
    "let us now compare our model for the nuclear unintegrated gluon distribution to the experimental data on nuclear ratios .",
    "the shadowing in nuclei is usually studied through the ratios of cross sections per nucleon for different nuclei . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the results of the model are compared with experimental data from refs .",
    "@xcite . in these figures ,",
    "the quantity @xmath88 $ ] is presented .",
    "we have selected data where @xmath89 and only statistic errors are shown .",
    "the solid lines ( here labeled as bm model ) represents the numerical results using @xmath90 .",
    "this means that we are using the conservative value of @xmath77 which reproduces the same growth for the nuclear saturation scale as in ref .",
    "it is verified that we fairly reproduce the behavior on @xmath2 for the nuclear ratio , predicting a larger nuclear shadowing for the carbon case .",
    "the model is able to describe data even in the region @xmath91 , taking part of the anti - shadowing region . considering both the absence of any free parameter in the nuclear unintegrated gluon distribution we find the agreement quite reasonable .",
    "for sake of comparison , we show the numerical results using the armesto - salgado - wiedemann ( asw ) model @xcite ( dashed lines ) for the nuclear cross section . it is verified a saturation of nuclear ration for @xmath92 and the model underestimate the data for lead target . for consistency",
    ", we have checked the results for nmc data ( @xmath93 ) and a smaller @xmath77 values seems to be preferred .",
    "this fact has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the nuclear enhancement in the saturation scale has been addressed in distinct saturation model ( with and without geometric scaling violation ) .",
    "as pointed out in that study , a precise extraction on the @xmath94 dependence of @xmath95 will play an important role in distinguishing between `` classical '' and `` quantum '' evolution in the cgc .",
    "similar discussion can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is timely discuss the qualitative aspects of the nuclear ratios using the present parameterization for the unintegrated gluon distribution . assuming geometric scaling in the region covered by the experimental data",
    ", we can investigate the asymptotic behaviors of the nuclear ratio . at intermediate @xmath2 , around @xmath96",
    "the unintegrated gluon distribution has the power - like behavior ( modulo logarithmic corrections ) @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( in fact , for the proton case we have additional scaling violations ) .",
    "this leads to the following result for the nuclear ratio , taking into account geometric scaling arguments : @xmath99^{\\gamma_c}=   \\left(\\frac{r_a^2}{a\\,r_p^2}\\right)^{1-\\gamma_c\\delta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the asymptotic behavior seems to be dependent on the product @xmath100 .",
    "notice that in our case @xmath101 against @xmath102 for the asw parameterization .",
    "therefore , the expression above help us to understand the deviations between asw model and the current model .",
    "we have checked that eq .",
    "( [ assymp1 ] ) exactly gives the plateau in @xmath103 seen in the asw results in the region @xmath104 .",
    "the enhancement observed in our case is a consequence of the anomalous dimension to be dependent on @xmath2 and @xmath71 in that kinematic region , where scaling violations start to take place .",
    "therefore , the discussion is more involved in that region , which resembles the discussion on the cronin peak in @xmath1 collisions .    on the other hand , for very small-@xmath2 ( and low @xmath71 ) , where @xmath105 , the unintegrated gluon distribution takes a logarithmic behavior .",
    "thus , one has @xmath106 $ ] and @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "this leads to the following result for the nuclear ratio , @xmath108=\\frac{r_a^2}{a\\,r_p^2 } \\left [ 1+\\delta\\frac{\\log(\\frac{r_a^2}{ar_p^2})}{\\log(\\frac{q^2}{q_{s}^2})}\\right]\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is clearly dependent on the saturation scale and on photon virtuality .",
    "in particular , the ratio seems to be closely independent of anomalous dimension @xmath41 .    as a final discussion",
    ", we discuss the relation of present model with recent determinations of the nuclear unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "notice that the usual notation for the unintegrated gluon density , @xmath109 is related to function @xmath4 by the following relation ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite for a derivation ) : @xmath110 there is an comprehensive research program in calculating the numerical solution for the nuclear gluon distribution from the bk equation including nlo effects such as the running coupling corrections @xcite . from the phenomenological point of view ,",
    "our results are similar to the numerical solution as on average the energy behavior for the saturation scale is consistent with @xmath111 and the main features of solutions are present .",
    "recently , a new modified bfkl equation incorporating the shadowing and anti - shadowing corrections of the gluon recombination to the unintegrated gluon function has been proposed through the rsyz equation @xcite .",
    "the numerical results from such an equation is not identical to the bk results in the transverse momentum space but is similar to a mean field result .",
    "of course , our model is less general than gluon function obtained from rsyz equation as we focus on the shadowing region . finally , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have tested several parameterizations of unintegrated gluon function in nucleus inspired on asymptotic solution of bk .",
    "most of them fit our expression for the @xmath4 , which gave satisfactory description of the data for ratio central / peripheral at rhic .",
