    "processes involving the creation or annihilation of strangeness are described in the standard model by @xmath5-exchange .",
    "while the theoretical formulation is simple at scales around the @xmath5-mass the description of nonleptonic decays of light hadrons at low energies is complicated and difficult because of the presence of the strong interaction .",
    "the problem is characterized by the @xmath6 selction rule , best known as the fact that the isospin @xmath7 amplitude of the @xmath8 decay is about 22 times larger than the @xmath9 amplitude . in spite of many efforts this enhancement of the @xmath6 channel over the @xmath10 channel has not been explained in a satisfactory way .",
    "a part of the answer comes from perturbative gluons which are created if one evolves the simple @xmath5-exchange - vertex from a scale of 80 gev down to 1 gev  @xcite .",
    "another part of the answer is supposed to arise from the structure of the light hadrons , whose description at scales around @xmath11 gev requires a nonperturbative qcd - method .    in the low energy regime one way to deal with nonperturbative effects",
    "is to utilize the large @xmath12 expansion with @xmath13 fixed ( @xmath12 being the number of colors and @xmath14 the running coupling constant of qcd ) . in the limit of large @xmath12 qcd can be treated as a weakly coupled meson field theory and indeed many experimental consequences have been explained in this way  @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath12 limit of qcd was also employed  @xcite in order to understand the @xmath6 problem in the @xmath8 decay . however , in contrast to the sector of the pure strong interaction , the large @xmath12 limit in its strict form ( only leading order in @xmath12 ) does not seem to be sufficient to describe the weak non - leptonic decays  @xcite because it enhances the @xmath10 channel while suppressing the @xmath6 one making the problem even more difficult .",
    "hence for these processes one is bound to go beyond leading order in the large @xmath12 expansion .    at low energies",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath15pt )  @xcite is known as a proper effective field theory of qcd in the mesonic sector . based on its success in describing strong interactions @xmath15pt",
    "was also applied to nonleptonic processes of light mesons  @xcite .",
    "however in this case there are not enough experimental data available to determine the many low energy constants ( lecs ) of the the effective weak chiral lagrangian to order @xmath16 .",

    "they used for this the small field expansion in leading and subleading order in the @xmath12 expansion . in the present paper",
    "we prefer the derivative expansion , since we want to evaluate the full effective chiral weak lagrangian to order @xmath16 including the corresponding lecs in a way that it can be used directly in @xmath15pt .",

    "the numerical results can be found in table ii .",
    "note that the lecs in the eikosiheptaplet can assume only two values .    taking into account the @xmath130 corrections ,",
    "the lecs are extracted as follows : @xmath206 table iii shows the effect of the @xmath170 corrections .",
    "the effective @xmath27 weak chiral lagrangian is obtained as @xmath207 the above formulae present the final result for the effective weak chiral lagrangian for @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "it is constructed in a way to be used in @xmath15pt without further treatment , since all lecs are explicitely given .",
    "the result is a strict outcome of the @xmath15qm and the expansion of its lagrangian in powers of the momentum and in the number of colors .",
    "it is assumed , however , that no external fields are present .",
    "the aim of the present work has been to derive the effective @xmath208 effective weak chiral lagrangian with its low energy constants from the chiral quark model using the weak effective action of buchalla , buras and lautenbacher  @xcite . in leading order in the large @xmath12 expansion",
    "the lagrangian is already known .",
    "the final result of our investigations is the effective weak chiral lagrangian in next - to - leading order in @xmath12 and to fourth order in the momentum .",
    "as is already known , the contribution of leading order in the large @xmath12 expansion to the ratio @xmath3 is heavily underestimated in this model .",
    "as we show in the present paper the inclusion of the next - to - leading order in the large @xmath12 expansion does not help to improve this result . hence on the present level of formalism and without further improvements the chiral quark model does not provide low energy constants which can directly be used in chiral perturbation theory for weak processes .",
    "of course such a conclusion can finally only be drawn if a few actual observables have been calculated in chiral perturbation theory by using the above effective weak chiral lagrangian . however , since the chiral quark model fails heavily in reproducing the ratio @xmath3 we do not have much hope that this will work .",
    "actually antonelli _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have added to the lowest order in @xmath12 certain corrections from the gluon condensate known as of order @xmath209  @xcite in order to change the ratio @xmath3 .",
    "they have shown that the @xmath209 corrections indeed improve numerically the @xmath6 enhancement . however , in our view there is an important caveat .",
    "in fact , the @xmath210 is of the same order as @xmath209 .",
    "the latter corrections were neglected by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite hoping that they might be smaller since they involve condensates of higher dimensions . in view of the large size of those corrections such an argument requires further substantiation , even though the numerical results are improved . in this paper",
    "no attempt was done to obtain gluonic corrections to the next - to - leading order in @xmath12 .    at the present level of investigation",
    "we see the following ways of investigations , which might improve the low energy constants of the chiral quark model .    first : the chiral quark model has been derived from qcd by diakonov and petrov  @xcite by assuming a gluonic vacuum configuration which consists of a dilute gas of interacting instantons and anti  instantons . as a result of this approach the constituent quark mass in the chiral quark model is momentum - dependent and it is only an approximation to replace this by a regularization prescription with a properly chosen cut  off parameter .",
    "thus it is interesting to investigate how far the present results change if such a momentum - dependent constituent mass is used .",
    "such an investigation is even necessary if one wants to exploit fully the chiral quark model .",
    "second : all the results in the present paper are based on the assumption that the effective weak hamiltonian of buchalla , buras and lautenbacher can be used in connection with the chiral quark model .",
    "this , however , is not that clear .",
    "if one considers the derivation of the chiral quark model from qcd by diakonv and petrov the renormalization point of the model is around 600 mev corresponding to the average size of the instantons of 0.3 fm and the average distance of 1 fm .",
    "the wilson coefficients of the effective weak hamiltonian are evaluated at a scale of 1 gev and it is not obvious if they can be used without further change at 600 mev .",
    "suggestions for investigations in this direction have recently been given in @xcite .    actually in our next investigations",
    "we will follow the first suggestion and will incorporate the momentum - dependent quark mass in the chiral quark model .",
    "such a procedure links the lagrangian of the chiral quark model to qcd and , perhaps , the results will be improved .",
