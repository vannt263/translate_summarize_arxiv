    "unfortunately , no analogous formula ( with fundamental solution ) exists for the solution to nonlinear volterra equation .",

    "the problem of existence of function  valued solutions to linear and nonlinear stochastic wave and heat equations has been investigated by many people .",

    "we study only the one - dimensional case . to treat regularity of the stochastic integral ( [ eq1 ] ) in the cases @xmath12 by this method will require development of the results analogous to fujita s ones for the higher dimensions . and , to date , this work has not been done .",
