    "recently there has been increasing interest in transport anisotropies of the longitudinal resistance at half - odd - integer filling factors from @xmath1 upwards @xcite .",
    "the anistropy is observed in high - mobility @xmath2 oriented gaas / algaas modulation - doped heterostructures with the low resistance direction typically aligned along the @xmath3 $ ] direction , however alignment along the @xmath4 $ ] direction has also been observed depending on electron density or in - plane magnetic fields @xcite . to explain this effect , new types of ground states",
    "have been proposed within high landau levels of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) which are based on striped phases that align parallel to the low - resistivity direction @xcite .",
    "to learn more about the influence of crystal orientation on possible anisotropies , we use a different substrate orientation , namely ( 110 ) gaas . the 2-dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) is made in a mbe - grown gaas / algaas @xmath5-doped heterostructure with a spacer thickness of @xmath6 resulting in peak - mobilities up to @xmath7 at densities @xmath8 .",
    "in comparison with @xmath2 grown structures , the two in - plane orthogonal crystal directions on @xmath9 , namely @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath10 $ ] , have explicitly different crystallographic symmetry .",
    "+ for optimizing the mobility of our 2degs we grew a variety of substrates where we varied the temperature , measured by a pyrometer , between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 giving the best morphologies and mobilities .",
    "the as - flux , measured as beam equivalent pressure , has been varied between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , leading to the result that the highest as - flux gives the best morphologies and the highest doping efficiencies of @xmath16 relative to the doping efficiencies on @xmath2 .",
    "these findings are in agreement with work previously being done on growth of @xmath9 gaas @xcite .     and @xmath17 .",
    "right picture : surface morphology of a sample grown at @xmath18 and @xmath17 .",
    "scale is @xmath19,width=264 ]    due to the fragile nature of the anisotropic ground states it is useful to measure at very low temperatures , especially in the case of @xmath9 2deg s where the mobility is not as high as in @xmath2-based systems .",
    "the measurements are performed in a dilution refrigerator cryostat with a base bath temperature of @xmath20 and a magnetic field up to @xmath21 . to have the best possible thermal coupling to the electron system it is crucial to make the contact resistance as low as possible .",
    "for this reason we modified the usual square - sample van - der - pauw contacting scheme by substituting two out of eight contacts with small openings leading to large contacts with lower resistance and thus , better thermal coupling ( fig .",
    "[ rxy ] bottom right inset ) .",
    "fig . [ dashier ] shows a trace of the longitudinal resistance for the two perpendicular current directions , drawn in the inset , at @xmath22 .",
    "we examine first the case of _ exactly _ half - filled levels ( i.e. the resistance at the center of each peak structure ) . with @xmath23 @xmath24 , designated by arrows at exactly @xmath25 and @xmath26 the resistances in the two directions are similar , staying within a factor of 2 of each other , whereas @xmath27 @xmath24 half - filled levels show a highly anisotropic behavior differing by a factor of @xmath28 in resistance , similar to anisotropies in @xmath2 systems . following previous authors we define the low - resistance trace as `` easy '' and the high - resistance trace as the `` hard '' @xcite .",

    "show the same type of @xmath30 trace , _ independent of the current contacts used_. for example all pairs of @xmath30 voltage contacts connected by the contiguous red dotted line show @xmath30 traces proportional to the red dotted data trace .",
    "the low temperature traces develop a strong anisotropy both at @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and strikingly at @xmath33 ( @xmath34).,width=294 ]    unlike previous @xmath2 studies , however , a striking anisotropy also develops away from half - filled levels in the neighborhood of @xmath35 where fractional quantum hall states are evident ( fig .",
    "[ dashier ] ) in the hard trace .",
    "this type of anisotropy has been predicted by @xcite .",
    "it is especially pronounced at filling factors @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 which correspond to the _ effective half - filled filling factors _ @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath26 in the composite fermion picture of the partially filled spin - up landau level . in fig .",
    "[ graph2 ] we see that the temperature dependence of the @xmath41 peak in the fractional regime is very similar to the dependence of the anisotropy in the @xmath1 peak in the higher landau level regime .",
    "we emphasize that all the resistivity peaks become isotropic again around @xmath42 .",
    "contrary to the longitudinal resistance there is no anisotropy to be seen in the hall resistance ( fig .",
    "[ rxy ] ) .",
    "the traces of the hall resistance for the two prependicular current directions are nearly identical .",
    "+ a detailed study indicated that no matter how the current is driven thru the sample , a pair of voltage contacts on the red dotted sample boundary shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ dashier ] reveals the `` easy '' characteristic and a pair of voltage contacts on the green solid sample boundary the `` hard '' . unlike previously observed qhe anisotropies , the choice of current contacts is not relevant .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties of this anisotropy is a dependence on the _ sign _ of the magnetic field .",
    "the regions of the sample which show the `` hard '' resistance characteristic switch to showing the `` easy '' characteristic and vice - versa _ upon reversing the polarity of the magnetic field_. an obvious explanation for this behavior is lacking , but it is observed at all voltage contact pairs .     for two perpendicular current directions indicated in the inset at @xmath43 .",

    "we showed that in high - mobility ( 110 ) gaas / algaas heterostructures there is an anisotropy at very low temperatures . to our knowledge",
    "it is the first observation of strong anisotropy of the longitudinal resistance in the fractional quantum hall regime .",
    "this effect is intriguing in that it can not be explained by existing theories for higher landau levels of electrons , but could possibly be explained using landau levels of _ composite fermions _ @xcite .",
    "this anisotropy , confirmed in multiple samples from the same wafer , switches character from `` hard '' to `` easy '' and vice - versa upon reversing the polarity of the magnetic field , while being remarkably insensitive to the direction of current in the sample . the switching behavior and",
    "the independence of current direction may suggest an ordered phase with symmetries different from that of a striped composite fermion phase proposed in @xcite .",
