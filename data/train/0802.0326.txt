    "in low - mass main sequence ( ms ) stars , internal structure is determined primarily by stellar mass rather than age .",
    "in contrast , surface activity as manifested in x - rays , at least for late - type dwarfs , seems to scale directly with rotation and by consequence with age , but is only weakly dependent on mass @xcite .",

    "a given line flux depends on plasma temperature and on the abundance of the element in question .",
    "the ratio of two emission lines from ions of the _ same _ element is independent of the abundance of the chosen element .",
    "we have therefore devised a method that uses line _",
    "ratios _ instead of line fluxes directly .",
    "we use a markov - chain monte - carlo analysis using a metropolis algorithm ( mcmc[m ] ) on the set of supplied line flux ratios @xcite to estimate the dem .",
    "our basic set of diagnostics comprises the h - like / he - like resonance line flux ratios for the elements o , ne , mg , and si , line ratios involving fe  xvii , fe  xviii and fe  xxi resonance lines , and measurements of the continuum flux at points in the spectrum that are essentially free of lines .",
    "these continuum values serve both to constrain the emission at high temperatures and to determine the absolute normalization of the dem .",
    "the set of lines include the brightest lines in stellar coronal spectra and are easily measured in essentially all well - exposed _",
    "_ grating observations of stellar coronae , such that star - to - star variations in diagnostic lines used can be avoided . the emission measure distribution and abundance analysis employed the chianti database version 4.2 @xcite and the ionization balance of @xcite , as implemented in the pintofale software package @xcite .",
    "hidden blends were corrected for based on the prediction of blending lines in the chianti database using the methods described in @xcite .",
    "the mcmc[m ] method yields the emission measure distribution over a pre - selected temperature grid , where the dem is defined for each t bin . in our case , a set of temperatures @xmath22 , with @xmath23$]=0.1 , define the dem(t@xmath24)=@xmath25 .",
    "the derived dem(t@xmath24 ) is reliable over a certain temperature range only if we have lines with contribution function g(@xmath26)@xmath10 g(@xmath27 ) .",
    "based on the lines we use in our analysis we are able to obtain a well - constrained dem(t@xmath24 ) between @xmath28$]=6.2 ( the coolest peak formation temperature given by the resonance line is @xmath28$]=6.3 ) and @xmath28$]=7.5 ( the hottest peak formation temperature given by the resonance line is @xmath28$]=7.4 ) ; larger uncertainties are obtained outside that range .",

    "we have adopted distances @xmath29=14.9pc , @xmath29=44.4pc and @xmath29=14.9pc for ab  dor , speedy  mic and rst  137b respectively @xcite .",
    "once the dem has been established , we can evaluate the abundances of any elements for which we have lines with measured fluxes .",
    "we derived values for the coronal abundances of the elements o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe .",
    "na was also studied although only upper limits were obtained owing to the weakness of the line features within our spectral bandpass ; s was also not detected in speedy  mic and rst  137b . in cases where there was more than one line for a given element ,",
    "the weighted average of the abundance determinations from each of the individual lines was adopted .    according to previous studies in the literature ,",
    "the photospheric abundances for ab  dor and speedy  mic are similar to the solar ones ( see  [ s : abdor ] and  [ s : speedymic ] ) .",
    "there are no photospheric abundance measurements available for rst  137b .",
    "however , its physical association with ab  dor ( see  [ s : rst137b ] ) presents a very plausible case for its abundances being solar - like .",
    "we therefore adopt the mixture of @xcite for comparing all coronal abundance results .",
    "the @xcite solar chemical composition shows a downward revision by 25 - 35%  of the abundances of light elements such as c , n , o and ne compared with values from earlies studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the use of these new values would increase the derived stellar coronal abundances of light elements relative to those obtained by using the solar chemical composition from earlies studies .",
    "in other words , the observed trends in any coronal abundance fip and inverse - fip effects @xcite will be slightly shallower and slightly steeper respectively if one uses the new solar chemical composition reported by @xcite .",
    "one exception to the @xcite mixture might be the element ne .",
    "@xcite have recently found ne / o to be enhanced by an average factor of 2.7 compared to the @xcite ratio in the coronae of approximately 20 nearby and mostly active stars . based on these results , we have assumed a ne abundance revised upward by 0.43dex with respect to @xcite .",
    "we discuss this in more detail in ",
    "[ s : abundances ] .",
    "we also used the temperature - insensitive abundance ratio diagnostics of @xcite as an additional check on our values obtained using the dem .",
    "these are ratios formed by combining two sets of lines of two different elements , constructed such that the combined emissivity curves of each set have essentially the same temperature dependence .",
    "the resulting ratio of measured line fluxes then yields directly the ratio of the abundances of the relevant elements , independent from the atmospheric temperature structure .",

    "[ f : dems ] illustrates the reconstructed dems for our three stars ab  dor , speedy  mic and rst  137b .",
    "although the dems for the three targets peak around @xmath30[k]@xmath317.0 - 7.1 , the overall shapes are slightly different .",
    "the dem for ab dor shows a primary peak at @xmath32 that extents to @xmath33 .",
    "the dem for speedy  mic has a less pronounced peak around @xmath327.1 and shows a sharper decrease for @xmath34 . finally , the dem for rst  137b is relatively flat , peaking at @xmath327.1 and showing a smooth steep decrease for higher temperatures .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the dem for ab dor is comparable with that reported recently by @xcite based on xmm-_newton _ and _ chandra _ observations .",
    "these authors obtained a slightly smoother increase in emission measure with rising temperature for @xmath35 , but a similar peak at @xmath32 and sharp decrease for the higher temperatures , @xmath36 .",
    "similar dem shapes have been derived based on euve and asca observations of ab  dor obtained in 1993 november by @xcite and @xcite ; these authors also note that the results are quite sensitive to the coronal abundances adopted .",
    "@xcite estimated the dem for speedy mic using a 6th order chebyshev polynomial method applied to an _ asca _ observation .",
    "while _ asca _",
    "spectra alone do not possess much temperature resolution , the single broad dem peaking at @xmath37 and also showing some evidence for plasma up to temperatures @xmath38 , is qualitatively similar to our result .    to our knowledge , there exist no other dem analyses of rst  137b by other authors with which to compare our temperature structure results . in general , the very limited information from earlier observations indicates that the dems themselves are not subject to large secular changes for these active stars .",
    "there are no striking features to the dems of any of these stars that distinguish them from those of similar fast rotators .",
    "other examples , such pz  tel ( rotation period @xmath39d ) and yy gem ( @xmath40d ) , show dems that peak at @xmath41 with and extension indicating significant plasma at temperatures a factor of 2 or so higher @xcite .",
    "these characteristics are slightly more similar to those of ab  dor than speedy  mic and rst  137b .",
    "our results for the element abundances of ab  dor , speedy  mic and rst  137b are summarized in table  [ t : abund1 ] .",

    "the abundance ratios derived from temperature - insensitive line ratios ( see  [ s : abund ] ) are listed in table  [ t : abund2 ] .",
    "within expected uncertainty ranges these values are in agreement with , and provide verification for , the ones derived from the dems ( table  [ t : abund1 ] ) , with the exception of the ratios involving fe . as noted by @xcite , however , these ratios are likely to exhibit larger systematic errors owing to a less optimum coincidence of the different line contribution functions as a function of temperature . in fig .  [",
    "f : abund ] we have plotted the derived abundances , relative to the adopted stellar photospheric values ( essentially the mixture of @xcite , with the exception of ne for which we adopt the @xcite value , as discussed earlier ) , in order of element fip .",
    "all three stars show some evidence for what has become know as an `` inverse - fip effect '' , with depletion of the low fip elements ( @xmath4210ev ) relative to photospheric values ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also note a slightly lower ne abundance with respect to the ne / o ratio of @xcite for all three stars ; this is most pronounced for rst  137b and ab  dor .",
    "it can be seen from comparison of the ne / o ratios obtained from dem modelling and temperature - insensitive line diagnostics ( table  [ t : abund2 ] ) that the former method tends to arrive at a slightly lower ne abundance than the latter .",
    "uncertainties in both methods are of order 0.1  dex ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the current discrepency is not beyond the bounds of the systematic errors of the two approaches . a comparison between the results from these methods in general is given in @xcite .",
    "the coronal abundances derived for ab  dor are in good agrement with those reported in the literature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the coronal abundances derived for speedy  mic are in reasonable agrement with the only ones reported in the literature for this object @xcite .",
    "the latter values were obtained using low spectral resolution _",
    "asca _ observations . to our knowledge , there are no other coronal abundance studies of rst  137b for comparison .    despite mg , fe and si having very similar fip , speedy mic and rst  137b show much lower fe abundances than si and mg compared with ab  dor .",
    "this effect has also been seen in other coronal abundance studies , as summarised by @xcite who suggested gravitational settling of the heavier fe ions as a possible explanation .",
    "we discuss this further below .",
    "it has been especially emphasised in the context of the solar corona that derived dems can be quite sensitive to the lines used for their derivation and to the uncertainties in the atomic data used .",
    "the best way to investigate systematically any trends in temperature structure with activity is therefore to use dems derived from observations made with the same instrumentation and line set .",
    "our sample of three stars severely limits any such discussion , though two possible trends are apparent .",
    "the slopes in the derived dems on the low temperature side of their maxima follow very approximately the relation dem@xmath43 , dem@xmath44 and dem@xmath45 for ab dor , speedy  mic and rst  137b respectively .",
    "this trend is in the direction of decreasing rotation period , and rossby number ( see below ) .",
    "furthermore , it is apparent that the the amount of plasma present at @xmath46 falls off in the same order .",
    "combined , the impression is that the ratio of material at hot ( @xmath47 ) and cooler ( @xmath48 ) temperatures tends to decrease with increasing saturation .    in order to compare these sparse , but systematically derived , results with those of other stars , we have computed the temperature - sensitive index @xmath49 , which we define as the ratio of the dem in the `` high '' temperature range ( @xmath30=6.9 - 7.6 ) to the total dem ( @xmath30=6.2 - 7.6 ) , for a larger sample of rapid rotators culled from analyses in the literature . while a fairly coarse representation of dem , this temperature index should be quite insensitive to the details of the different methods and data used to derive it .",
    "the sample of stars investigated is listed in table  [ t : sample ] , together with their relevant properties .    since we are studing stars of different spectral type , it is also instructive to use the _ rossby number_the ratio of the rotational period to the convective turnover time @xmath50instead of the rotational period in order to compare the behaviour of their coronal structure and chemical composition .",
    "@xcite showed that the rossby number is closely related to the dynamo number for a fluid and is expected to scale directly with the generation of magnetic flux .",
    "@xcite first demonstrated the tight correlation between the ca  ii h and k chromospheric activity indicators and stellar rossby number , and the correlation also holds through to coronal activity indicators such as x - ray luminosity ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio @xmath50 is a function of stellar mass , and saturation will start to be seen at progressively longer rotation periods for stars with lower masses .",
    "according to @xcite , supersaturated stars from open cluster data have rossby numbers log@xmath51 @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "therefore , speedy  mic and rst  137b are in principle included in this range , while ab dor sits near the saturated - supersaturated boundary region ( see table  [ t : par ] ) .    in fig",
    "[ f : ross_hilo ] we show both @xmath9 ( upper panel ) and @xmath49 ( lower panel ) vs rossby number for the sample of stars in table  [ t : par ] .",
    "the @xmath9 values for this sample do not exhibit any evidence for the supersaturation effect , although a very clear saturation plateau at the canonical value @xmath53 is readily apparent .",
    "this lack of supersaturation signature in field stars was pointed out by @xcite , and also characterises the sample of young cluster and field stars studied recently by @xcite .",
    "thus , while speedy  mic and rst  137b are within the regime of supersaturation , their @xmath9 indices are representative of the canonical saturated regime .    despite the lack of supersaturation signature in @xmath9 , the lower panel of fig  [ f : ross_hilo ] indicates different behaviour in thermal structure . as the rossby number decreases and approaches the saturated - supersaturated boundary region , the emission measure at the `` high '' temperature range increases relative to the total emission measure .",
    "however , once the supersaturated region is reached this trend inverts , showing a decline in the emission measure of plasma at high temperatures .",
    "thus , the supersaturation boundary that is apparent through a decline in @xmath9 past a critical rossby number of @xmath54 in some open clusters @xcite , but appears not to be present in field stars , does seem to be marked in the latter sample by this transition to a somewhat cooler dominant corona .",
    "@xcite suggested , as a possible explanation for supersaturation in l@xmath14 , that very rapid rotation could lead to a substantially higher coronal temperature and to the shift of the dem out of the rosat passband .",
    "however , our dem results for ab  dor , speedy  mic and rst  137b , in addition to the @xmath49 indices for the sample of stars in table  [ t : sample ] , show little evidence for substantial amounts of plasma at temperatures higher than @xmath30=7.1 ; the opposite trend is observed and essentially rules out this hypothesis .",
    "@xcite reached a similar conclusion for the supersaturated star vxr45 based on an xmm - newton observation .",
    "since the stars in our sample do not exhibit obvious supersaturation characteristics , any clear significance of the results in the context of other hypotheses attempting to explain the supersaturation phenomenon is not obvious .",
    "the rate of magnetic energy dissipation in the coronae of our saturated and supersaturated stars , as gauged by the x - ray to bolometric luminosity , is essentially the same ; rather , it is a fairly subtle difference in the properties of this dissipation that gives rise to different coronal temperatures .",
    "we also note that rapid rotation can give rise to a significant reduction in the effective surface gravity at lower stellar latitudes ; in this context , the shift in plasma toward cooler temperatures in the supersaturated regime goes contrary to expected scaling of increasing coronal temperature with decreasing surface gravity for hydrostatic models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , direct x - ray spectroscopic evidence based on _ chandra _ hetg observations of ab  dor suggests that very active stellar coronae are indeed pole - dominated , as has been hinted by the presence of large polar starspots @xcite , in which case the effects of centrifugal forces would be lessened to some degree .",
    "one further plausible culprit for influencing coronal plasma temperature in otherwise similar stars is the chemical composition through its influence on the radiative loss function .",
    "as we discuss below , there are some quite wide variations in composition within the sample of stars condidered . however ,",
    "none of these appear to show a significant correlation with coronal temperature past the saturation - supersaturation boundary .      in order to search for trends in coronal abundances with activity parameters ,",
    "we have also compared results derived here with other results obtained for slightly `` slower '' rotators by ourselves and other workers .",
    "these results are summarised in table  [ t : sample ] .",
    "elements considered are o , mg , si and fe . while other elements , such as s and ar , are also very interesting for abundance studies based on fip or other parameters , the he - like and h - like ions are not easily detected in cooler coronae and it is difficult to accrue a meaningful sample from the current literature .",
    "we do not discuss ne here as we found its behaviour to follow closely that of o in the star sample considered here ; this is consistent with the study of @xcite who found that a ratio ne / o@xmath55 by number represented well a sample of 21 mostly active stars .",
    "all abundances are expressed relative to the solar mixture recommended by @xcite , in the usual spectroscopic bracket notation . in the following discussion it should , as usual , be borne in mind that the underlying stellar photospheric abundances can differ substantially from solar values ; more important are differences relative to the solar _ mixture _ ( ie cases where , for elements a and b , [ a / b]@xmath56 ) .",
    "we note cases where this is relevant in the apppropriate points in the discussion below .",
    "the table  [ t : sample ] sample confirms nicely the trend of coronal [ fe / h ] with activity indices . a relationship between fe abundance and activity",
    "was first suggested by @xcite and @xcite based on early _ asca _ and _ euve _ results , and has since been further fleshed - out based on _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of varied samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as a study of solar - like stars covering a range of activity @xcite . in figure",
    "[ f : feh ] we illustrate coronal [ fe / h ] for the sample as a function of @xmath1 , rossby number , and the dem temperature - sensitive index @xmath49 .",
    "the latter relation shows an obvious , albeit scattered , correlation of decreasing [ fe / h ] with increasing hot emission measure fraction , as expected based on the earlier work cited above .",
    "coronal temperature might be regarded only as a proxy indicator of stellar activity  it is observed to correlate well with @xmath1 for example @xcite  and the trends of [ fe / h ] with @xmath1 and rossby number are indeed more direct and interesting .",
    "the relation with @xmath1 shows a clear trend of declining iron abundance with increasing activity level , with a break in behaviour at @xmath57 between shallow and steep declines at low and higher activity levels , respectively .",
    "can any of this trend be attributed to underlying stellar fe abundances ? among thin disk stars , age metallicity effects would act in the opposite direction to that observed : younger , more active stars should have higher , not lower , metal abundances . moreover , the age spread for stars considered here ( a few gyr or less ) is also small for large metallicity differences to be present .",
    "it is possible , however , that some of the binaries could belong to the thick disk population for which lower metallicities would not be unusual .    in the crowded @xmath58 region , stellar metallicity",
    "might also be expected to play a role in the large variation of coronal [ fe / h ] . however , the strong trend here toward lower coronal metallicity with higher @xmath1 is shared among single stars and binary stars of both evolved and unevolved type .",
    "of the single dwarfs , noteable objects with large differences in coronal [ fe / h ] are ab  dor and its companion rst  137b , and the group of intermediate activity stars @xmath59  cet , @xmath60  eri , @xmath61  ori and @xmath62  uma .",
    "all these stars have measured photospheric metallicities within @xmath63  dex of solar ( see table  [ t : phot_abuns ] ) . in the middle of the range",
    "lie the young pleiades moving group g dwarfs 47  cas  b and ek  dra , whose photospheric compositions are not expected to deviate from local cosmic values .",
    "ek  dra then appears to have an unmodified coronal fe abundance , while that of 47  cas  b might be very slightly depleted .",
    "the factor of 3 difference in coronal [ fe / h ] of these stars _ can not be attributed to photospheric abundance differences _ and must be the result of chemical fractionation in the outer atmospheres of the more active stars in which fe is quite strongly depleted .    the relation with rossby number also supports the above conclusion .",
    "a similar correlation among active dwarfs was reported earlier by @xcite based on low resolution asca spectra .",
    "the dwarf single and binary stars follow the clear trend of decreasing fe abundance with increasing activity ( decreasing rossby number ) elucidated as a function of @xmath1 , but here four of the rs  cvn - type binaries are separated from the group ( hr  1099 , ux  ari , vy  ari and ii  peg ) .",
    "it is tempting to ascribe this to lower photospheric fe abundances : ii  peg has been studied in detail by @xcite and @xcite who found [ m / h]@xmath64 , and @xmath65 , repsectively , while the subgiant of the hr  1099 binary appears quite fe - poor in the li study by @xcite ( though this latter study estimated [ fe / h]=0 for the g dwarf secondary ) .",
    "however , @xcite found essentially solar fe for vy  ari .",
    "the reason for the separation of these rs  cvn - type stars from the group in the [ fe / h ] vs. rossby number plot then appears to be the result of the different convection zone parameters of these somewhat evolved stars : while it works well for dwarfs , rossby number is not a fundamental scaling agent for the coronal fe content of stars of different luminosity class .    beyond the supersaturation limit , there appears to be a greater scatter in [ fe / h ] among dwarfs than at larger rossby number .",
    "the data appear to be suggestive of a sharper drop in [ fe / h ] as this limit is reached .",
    "however , since the m dwarfs ad leo , ev lac , and yy gem all lie above the earlier type active k - dwarfs speedy mic and rst 137b in this plot , the spread here might also be attributed to spectral type , and consequently to differences in convection zone parameters .",
    "search for trends in o abundance with stellar activity indicators carries the potential for systematic errors correlated with the index being examined . the available o feature in stellar x - ray spectra are the he - like and h - like resonance whose emissivity functions peak at @xmath66 t=6.3 and 6.5 , respectively .",
    "as noted above , dominant plasma temperatures increase with increasing activity , and lie at @xmath67 in active stars .",
    "errors in understanding dems at lower temperatures where significant o  vii and o  viii flux can originate then have the potential to skew abundance - activity relations .    additionally , owing to the different contributions to metal enrichment of the galaxy through its history , comparison of o and fe abundances",
    "is further complicated by unknown or uncertain intrinsic metallicity , and even whether stars belong to thin or thick disk populations .",
    "@xcite show that local thick disk stars have higher [ o / fe ] by @xmath68  dex than those of the local thin disk at moderate metal deficiencies ( @xmath69[fe / h]@xmath70 ) ; superimposed on both is the usual trend of increasing [ o / fe ] with declining [ fe / h ] .",
    "this should not be a problem for our young , single stars , but must be borne in mind when considering the active binaries whose ages are much less certain .",
    "we illustrate [ o / h ] as a function of the temperature index @xmath49 , @xmath1 and rossby number in figure  [ f : ooh ] .",
    "if the rs  cvn stars are excluded , there is a weak trend in the first of these of increasing [ o / h ] with increasing @xmath49 .",
    "a similar trend in ne abundance is also apparent in the literature survey of @xcite  as expected based on the constancy of the ne / o ratio noted earlier .",
    "is this temperature trend a result of systematic error , underlying stellar composition , or fractionation ?",
    "the relation with @xmath1 shows the single stars to scatter about [ o / h]@xmath71 , with the rs  cvn - type binaries lying systematically above this ; dwarf binaries are instead scattered over a much larger range .",
    "we emphasise that we have referred the [ o / h ] values to the solar value recommended by @xcite ; were we to adopt that of @xcite , the above values would be @xmath72  dex _ lower_. the photospheric o abundances for the g dwarfs @xmath61  ori and @xmath62  uma are by differential analysis ( ie essentially free from modelling systematic errors ) essentially solar yet have coronae apparently deficient in o by factors of more than 2 ; it seems difficult to escape the conclusion that o must be depleted in the coronae of these stars .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by @xcite in a detailed study of lower activity k dwarfs .",
    "it is plausible that some of the range in [ o / h ] is due to underlying stellar composition . in the cases of ii",
    "peg and v851  cen , photospheric evidence suggests mild metal paucity . were these to be thick disk objects of near - solar metallicity",
    "the survey of @xcite suggests an abundance [ o / h]@xmath68 would not be too unreasonable",
    ".    the [ o / fe ] ratio to some extent alleviates scatter due to global metallicity differences between stars ; these are illustrated in figure  [ f : oofe ] .",
    "the strong trends with all three activity indices are readily apparent ; similar trends in [ o / fe ] with coronal temperature were also noted for rs  cvn - types and a mixed sample by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "most remarkable is the tight relation with rossby number in which the single and active binary dwarfs follow essentially the same increase in [ o / fe ] with decreasing rossby number .",
    "the trend is seen to break at the supersaturation limit , beyond which there is no further increase and some suggestion that [ o / fe ] either saturates or perhaps declines slightly .",
    "the rs  cvn - type binaries , with the exception of ar  lac , show the same conspicuous separation in [ o / fe ] as they do in both [ fe / h ] and [ o / h ] , only exacerbated by the ratio combination . as a function of @xmath1 ,",
    "ux  ari and ii  peg stand a factor of @xmath73 above the scatter among the most active dwarf stars , and an order of magnitude above the dwarfs of equivalent rossby number .",
    "we conclude that the physical underpinning of these observations must depend strongly on spectral type , and in particular on luminosity class .",
    "it is also possible that the different behavior of the rs  cvn - types is somehow a result of the influence of their binarity on chemical fraction processes . that coronal plasma temperature is not the key underlying factor is demonstrated by the recent study of coronal abundances in giant stars by @xcite",
    ": these stars have similar coronal temperatures to the active dwarfs and rs  cvn - types , yet exhibit either unmodified or low [ o / fe ] ratios typical of a solar - like fip effect .",
    "if we exclude possible contributions to the observed range in coronal o / fe from intrinsic stellar scatter , coronal activity differences among the sample appear to give rise to a variation in o / fe by a factor of 10 .",
    "while it is premature to speculate on fractionation mechanisms based on the dataset considered here , it seems possible that the alvn wave pondermotive force model considered by @xcite offers some potential here .",
    "@xcite found that the fractionation effect produced was quite strongly dependent on the wave propagation and reflection properties of the chromosphere and lower corona , and on the alfvnic turbulence frequency spectrum ",
    "one might expect both of these to be dependent on spectral type , rotation rate , and perhaps also tidal distortion .",
    "pursuit of these ratios is potentially important : any coronal fractionation between the mg - si - fe trio is interesting because these elements have very similar fips .",
    "evidence that fe appears systematically low relative to si and mg in some stars was discussed by @xcite , who suggested this as a possible diagnostic of gravitational settling of the twice as heavy fe relative to lighter mg and si . acting against relative settling of heavier ions is mixing by flows and turbulence , and kinetic effects such as thermal diffusion that act in a temperature gradient to pull heavier ions toward hotter temperatures .",
    "constraints on , or measurements of , gravitational settling might then provide useful insights into coronal loop and plasma flow properties .",
    "as in the case of [ o / fe ] noted above , ratios of the @xmath21-elements mg and si to that of fe are also prone to scatter and systematic bias as a result of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "further systematic errors are possible in the evaluation of the si / fe ratio owing to the different temperatures over which the dominant fe lines ( weighted largely by fe  xvii at @xmath74 , though higher charge states are often detected ) and si he - like and h - like lines ( @xmath75 ) are formed .    among our sample studied here , there are no obvious trends of mg / fe or si / fe with activity parameters , except perhaps an indication of declining mg / fe with coronal temperature index @xmath49 .",
    "one conspicuous outlier is ii  peg , which has both mg / fe and si / fe of nearly three times the solar value ; as noted earlier in the context of its high o / fe ratio , its mild photospheric metal deficiency suggests that this might at least in part be explained by enhanced photospheric @xmath21-elements .",
    "the ratios in the other stars are also skewed toward values larger than unity , though by only 0.1  dex or so .",
    "this also could simply reflect photospheric values : @xcite note that the sun appears deficient by roughly 0.1 dex in o , si , ca , in addition to some other less abundant elements compared to its immediate neighbors with similar iron abundances .    such a skew might also be due simply to systematic errors of measurement rather than other mechanisms such as gravitational settling .",
    "however , as we noted earlier , we find speedy mic and rst  137b to have larger coronal mg / fe and si / fe ratios than ab  dor from a study involving the same lines and analysis techniques that should minimise systematic errors .",
    "these results suggest that some fractionation is at work .",
    "disentangling all the possible contributions to the observed mg / fe and si / fe ratios is well beyond our current study and requires more detailed photospheric abundances .",
    "more detailed investigation of these ratios in a wider sample of stars would be well - motivated .",
    "ab  dor , speedy mic and rst  137b represent young ( @xmath0 100myr ) rapidly rotating ( p@xmath7612hr ) late - type stars lying at the saturated - supersaturated corona boundary region . based on an analysis of high resolution _",
    "chandra _ x - ray spectra of these stars and subsequent comparison with results for other active stars culled from the literature we draw the following conclusions .    1",
    ".   the temperature structures of ab  dor , speedy  mic and rst  137b all peak at @xmath30[k]@xmath107.0 - 7.1 , though the overall dem shapes are slightly different .",
    "if the dem trends observed here in only three stars can be generalised , they hint that as supersaturation is reached the dem slope below the temperature of peak dem becomes shallower , while the dem drop - off above this temperature becomes more pronounced .",
    "2 .   in the context of the larger stellar sample",
    ", we observe that in dwarf single and binary stars coronal thermal structure shows an increase in the emission of plasma at high temperatures ( @xmath77 ) as the rossby number decreases and approaches the saturated - supersaturated boundary .",
    "however , once the supersaturated region is reached this trend inverts ; supersaturated stars maintain a smaller fraction of coronal plasma at and above 10 million  k than stars of higher rossby number .",
    "this result is consistent with the tentative generalised dem behaviour outlined in ( 1 ) .",
    "3 .   all three of the stars studied in detail here show evidence for an inverse of the solar - like fip effect , with smaller coronal abundances of the low fip elements mg , si and fe , relative to the high fip elements s , o and ne .",
    "this is consistent with existing coronal abundance studies of other active stars .",
    "the stellar sample shows that coronal fe abundance is inversely correlated with @xmath1 , and for dwarfs is also well - correlated with rossby number .",
    "the fe abundance is seen to decline slowly with rising @xmath1 , but declines sharply at @xmath4 .",
    "coronal o abundances average at values of [ o / h]@xmath78 .",
    "comparison of coronal and photospheric values for some of the sample suggests that active stellar coronae are in general slightly depleted in o relative to their photospheres .",
    ".   the are no obvious trends of o abundance with activity indicators",
    ". derived coronal o abundances are perhaps very weakly correlated with the coronal temperature index @xmath49 with hotter coronae possibly exhibiting larger o abundances .",
    "rs  cvn - type binaries exhibit systematically larger o abundances than dwarfs ; this could be partially due to galactic evolutionary differences in [ o / fe ] between dwarf and rs  cvn samples . 7",
    "the coronal o / fe ratio for dwarfs shows a strong trend of increasing o / fe with decreasing rossby number , and appears to saturate at the supersaturation boundary with a value of [ o / fe]@xmath79 .",
    "similar correlations are seen with o / fe increasing as a function of coronal temperature index , as revealed in earlier work , and with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the range in o / fe variations attributable to differences in coronal properties among the sample is about a factor of 10 .",

    "<S> ab  dor , speedy mic and rst  137b are in their early post - t tauri evolutionary phase ( @xmath0 100  myr ) , at the age of fastest rotation in the life of late - type stars . </S>",
    "<S> they straddle the coronal saturation - supersaturation boundary first defined by young stars in open clusters . </S>",
    "<S> high resolution _ </S>",
    "<S> chandra _ x - ray spectra have been analysed to study their coronal properties as a function of coronal activity parameters _ rossby number _ , @xmath1 and a coronal temperature index . </S>",
    "<S> plasma emission measure distributions as a function of temperature show broad peaks at @xmath2  k. differences between stars suggest that as supersaturation is reached the dem slope below the temperature of peak dem becomes shallower , while the dem drop - off above this temperature becomes more pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> a larger sample comprising our three targets and 22 active stars studied in the recent literature reveals a general increase of plasma at @xmath3 toward the saturated - supersaturated boundary but a decline beyond this among supersaturated stars . </S>",
    "<S> all three of the stars studied in detail here show lower coronal abundances of the low fip elements mg , si and fe , relative to the high fip elements s , o and ne , as compared to the solar mixture . </S>",
    "<S> the coronal fe abundances of the stellar sample are inversely correlated with @xmath1 , declining slowly with rising @xmath1 , but with a much more sharp decline at @xmath4 . for dwarfs </S>",
    "<S> the fe abundance is also well - correlated with rossby number . </S>",
    "<S> coronal o abundances appear lower than photospheric expectations by up to @xmath5  dex , but with no obvious trends with activity indices . </S>",
    "<S> the coronal o / fe ratios for dwarfs show a clear increase with decreasing rossby number , apparently reaching saturation at [ o / fe]=0.5 at the coronal supersaturation boundary . </S>",
    "<S> similar increases in o / fe with increasing coronal temperature and @xmath1 are seen . </S>",
    "<S> the range in o / fe variations attributable to outer atmosphere chemical fractionation in our sample is about a factor of 10 . </S>"
