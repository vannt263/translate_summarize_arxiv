    "discrete symmetries in string compactification are the key ingredients in investigating effective low energy interactions @xcite .",

    "discrete symmetries dictate the classical interactions . given the interactions , quantum corrections may or may not break the discrete symmetries . to cancel quantum mechanical anomalies , in an effective theory at low energy with an integer normalization with the smallest integer charge magnitude set to 1 ,",
    "the needed constraints have been obtained in refs .",
    "if the constraints can not be satisfied , it was argued that there exist new fractionally charged states and an enlarged symmetry group at high energy @xcite . in string compactification , we can obtain all the massless spectrum below the compactification scale @xmath6 .",
    "the kaluza - klein(kk ) states have masses above @xmath7 , and we anticipate that no quantum mechanical inconsistency of light fields results from the kk states . indeed in ref .",
    "@xcite , no inconsistency was found from string compactification with the string modular invariance conditions satisfied .",
    "the kk states may have consequently an enlarged symmetry compared to that of the corresponding massless spectrum @xcite , but the massless spectra from string compactification already satisfy the constraints @xcite and an enlarged symmetry may not be mandatory .",

    "if one tries to separate the shadow world s from o by cutting the wormhole , the vacant space between the cut surfaces must be null by creating + and  gauge charges at the cut surfaces of fig .",
    "[ fig : wormhole ] .",
    "so , the observer o will notice that the gauge charge is conserved since he recovers the + charges of the cut surface , and the wormhole looks like carrying a hair .",
    "on the other hand , global charges have a different fate since they do not drag field lines .",
    "if global charges escape from the observable universe o to some shadow universe s , cutting the wormhole to separate the shadow world s from o does not leave any trace to o and the observer o notices that the global charge is not conserved in his universe o , concluding wormholes ( or gravity ) break global symmetries .    around a particle ,",

    ", being not concerned with quantum gravity , we limit ourselves to the case of weak gravity . but for the gauge interactions , quantum corrections may break the discrete symmetry , which has been studied considering the discrete gauge anomaly @xcite . considering the string compactification in this paper , however , we will not worry about discrete anomalies if the discrete group arises from a subgroup of a gauge u(1 ) of string compactification .",

    "this can happen with @xmath229 .",
    "so , requiring the vevs of @xmath230 and @xmath231 sufficiently small , _",
    "@xmath232 , the effective @xmath68 term is sufficiently suppressed . in this sense",
    ", we have a hierarchy of vevs , @xmath233 , satisfying the f- and d - flat conditions .",
    "this scenario may be better than those completely forbidding proton decay , in the sense of observing proton decay in the near future .      for the approximate pq symmetry in @xmath204",
    ", one can consider many possibilities .",
    "but not writing down all the spectra here , it is difficult to present the scenario concretely .",
    "here we present the idea only , with a hidden confining force for dynamical susy breaking .",
    "there exist heavy quarks .",
    "if the heavy quarks are assigned some pq charges , then some singlets must carry the pq charges since these singlet vevs give masses to the heavy quarks .",
    "let all the other fields carry zero pq charges .",
    "then , this pq symmetry can not be a gauge symmetry since the singlets must couple at some higher order to other fields such as to @xmath202 and @xmath203 , allowed by gauge symmetry but forbidden by the pq symmetry .",
    "so , the u(1)@xmath32 we introduced is an approximate one . if the string compactification does not introduce the anomalous u(1 ) , we have ( 1 ) the model - independent axion @xcite and ( 2 ) the axion from the above pq symmetry we introduced from the heavy quarks .",
    "this two axion system has the following feature .",
    "the mass eigenstates are such that heavier axion ( obtaining mass by the hidden sector gauge anomaly ) has decay constant presumably at the intermediate scale @xmath234 by the vevs of singlets ( the smaller vev of the two scales ) and the qcd axion has the decay constant raised to the string scale ( the larger vev of the two scales ) @xcite . however",
    ", if the string compactification introduces the anomalous u(1 ) @xcite , the anomalous u(1 ) becomes a global u(1 ) below the anomalous u(1 ) gauge boson mass .",
    "again , the decay constant corresponding to the model - independent axion is expected at the gut scale , and by a similar argument discussed above the qcd axion decay constant is expected at the gut scale if a fine - tuning is not introduced .",
    "the basic reason for this difficulty results from another unbroken nonabelian gauge group at the intermediate scale , which can be circumvented in composite qcd axion scenarios @xcite",
    ". it will be very useful if a fundamental qcd axion resolves this problem with discrete symmetries @xcite .",
    "we have presented a simple and explicit method of obtaining abelian discrete groups @xmath0 from string compactification , by assigning vevs to specified sm singlets . for the application , we need a full spectrum from string compactification .",
    "@xmath3 can be embedded in a gauged u(1 ) direction in the string compactification . in this case",
    ", we need not worry about discrete anomalies and obtaining the full spectrum is the requisite . to have a dm candidate a @xmath22",
    "is required to be unbroken .",
    "if applied to global symmetries such as to u(1)@xmath32 and u(1)@xmath63 , the vacua are tilted .",
    "the discrete symmetries @xmath39 and @xmath1 from string compactification are also discussed .",
