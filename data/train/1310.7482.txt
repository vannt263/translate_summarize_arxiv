    "the intrinsic non - gaussianity of primordial curvature perturbations is a valuable tool to distinguish among different models for the origin of structure in the very early universe  @xcite .",
    "even if the primordial curvature perturbation has a gaussian distribution , the initial density perturbation is non - gaussian due to the non - linearity of the einstein field equations @xcite .",
    "non - gaussianity ( ng ) may be characterized by a variety of different parameters , which control the departure of the underlying probability distribution function ( pdf ) of primordial fluctuations from a purely gaussian distribution .",
    "these parameters can be related to the amplitude of connected @xmath2-point ( @xmath2-pt ) correlation functions of primordial curvature fluctuations that vanish for @xmath3 in the gaussian case .",
    "the connected @xmath2-pt functions may be scale- and shape - dependent , in a manner determined by the particular model that generates them . in this work",
    ", we will focus on the so - called local shape of ng , in which the primordial gravitational potential in coordinate space can be expressed as an expansion in powers of one or more gaussian random fields that determine the primordial density fluctuations . in this case",
    "3-pt functions of curvature fluctuations are determined by a parameter , @xmath1 , that at lowest order in a perturbative expansion characterizes the skewness of the pdf of primordial fluctuations .",
    "4pt functions are determined by parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath4 , controlling the kurtosis of the pdf at lowest order in perturbations .",

    ". it may be unlikely that we live in a universe with a large hierarchy between @xmath1 and @xmath0 local @xcite , but this possibility can not be excluded _ a priori _ and there are theoretical models able to predict this pattern ( see for example @xcite or the discussion in @xcite ) . since",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath0 control distinct features of the pdf ( skewness and kurtosis ) it is very important to have the best observational constraints on each of them .",
    "complementary observables have to be considered to set more stringent bounds on non - gaussian parameters , in particular on @xmath0 , and one possibility is to use the statistics of large - scale structure .",
    "pioneering papers by dalal et al @xcite , slosar et al @xcite , matarrese et al @xcite , afshordi and tolley @xcite highlighted an interesting feature of primordial ng of local shape : it introduces a specific correlation between modes of different wavelengths which leads to a characteristic scale dependence of the halo bias .",
    "much work has been done so far to explore this interesting topic ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "however it turns out to be challenging to disentangle the contributions from different non - gaussian parameters using only halo and matter power spectra , since the characteristic scale dependence of the bias is primarily sensitive to a particular combination of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 parameters @xcite .",
    "mild corrections associated with the red - shift dependence of the halo mass function have been used to set the first lss constraints on @xmath0 in @xcite , but it is difficult to convincingly distinguish the effect of @xmath1 from that of @xmath0 using only galaxy power spectra .",
    "independent constraints on @xmath1 from cmb are useful , but not conclusive because @xmath1 could be characterized by a significant scale dependence @xcite , that makes its value probed at lss scales different with respect to the one tested at cmb scales .",
    "a promising method that may break the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath0 is to study the bispectra of halo and matter densities , which are sensitive to a non - linear bias parameter that depends specifically on @xmath0 , and allows us to break the aforementioned degeneracy .",
    "jeong and komatsu @xcite ( see also @xcite ) were the first among various groups to include the scale dependence of halo bias when studying bispectra , by considering the non - linear evolution of the halo overdensity in a local , univariate bias expansion , where the halo abundance is taken to be a function of the local density .",

    "our work contains several results , and we present these in a modular way to render the paper easier to read .",
    "we begin with some theoretical sections discussing how to implement the peak - background split and barrier crossing approaches to determine concise analytical expressions for halo and matter bispectra , when the gravitational potential is a function of either single or multiple sources ( e.g. , due to fluctuations of single or multiple fields during inflation in the very early universe ) .",
    "our formulae are obtained by applying to bispectra the methods developed in @xcite for power spectra .",
    "see also @xcite for an interesting paper discussing how to implement the peak background splitting approach to bispectra .",
    "we use a generalization of the univariate bias approach , making the hypothesis that the local number of halos forming at a given position is a function of the matter contrast , _ and _ of its local correlation functions evaluated at that position .",
    "this is an alternative to the bivariate approach @xcite where the halo abundance is assumed to be a function of both the density field and the gravitational potential . in practice ,",
    "the physical effect of long - wavelength modes of the potential is to modulate the small - scale variance of the density field in local models of ng .",
    "our extended univariate approach is physically transparent , and allows us to recover some of the results of the bivariate approach , in appropriate limits .",
    "in addition we can include local variations of effective non - gaussianity parameters on halo abundance @xcite .",
    "the resulting bispectra contain several contributions scaling with different powers of the scale @xmath12 , weighted by coefficients depending on primordial non - gaussian parameters .",
    "in the limit of large scales , in which analytic expressions for the transfer functions can be derived , we will discuss how bispectra have qualitative features that make it possible , at least in principle , to distinguish the effects of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "for example , by studying the properties of the bispectra as a function of the scale , we determine a connection between the sign of the halo bispectrum and ng parameters , in particular the value of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we show that there exists a combination of halo and matter bispectra that is sensitive to @xmath1 only , allowing us to probe @xmath1 without contaminations from @xmath0 .",
    "we then extend all these results , obtained in the case of a single source for the primordial gravitational potential , to a two - field example that allows us to understand how multiple sources contribute to galaxy bispectra .",
    "in @xcite it was pointed out that if multiple fields source the primordial gravitational potential , then halo overdensities need not be fully correlated with matter overdensities .",
    "we show that a combination of halo and matter power spectra is particularly convenient for studying the phenomenon of _ stochastic halo bias_. our analysis enable us to extend the concept of stochastic halo bias in the presence of primordial ng to the cases of both power spectra and bispectra , including the effect of @xmath0 . the fact that this stochastic bias is non - vanishing can be interpreted in terms of inequalities satisfied by primordial non - gaussian parameters , and these provide information on the number of fundamental fields sourcing ng . we determine a new combination of halo and matter bispectra",
    "whose value can be used to distinguish the effect of single and multiple sources on the primordial gravitational potential , and discuss its physical interpretation .    in the second part of our work",
    ", we apply our theoretical findings to a systematic numerical analysis of bispectra in appropriate squeezed limits , by using press - schechter halo mass functions supplemented by non - gaussian corrections controlled by an edgeworth expansion .",
    "this discussion enables us to apply our results to scales and redshifts that can be probed in present or future surveys . by plotting the resulting halo bispectra",
    ", we explore the different roles played by @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical analysis confirms our analytical results .",
    "we show that qualitative features of the profiles of halo and matter bispectra as a function of the scale are sensitive to different ng parameters , possibly allowing us to test them individually .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate how galaxy bispectra have features that could distinguish between different non - gaussian parameters , in a way that is not possible by studying only the scale dependence of galaxy bias in power spectra of halos and matter .",

    "the continuous line is the gravity bispectrum associated with non - linear bias @xmath77 ( we take @xmath199 ) .",
    "[ fig : six ]    we notice that the amplitude of the bispectrum due to primordial ng tends to dominate at large scales ( small @xmath12 ) .",

    "the primordial bispectrum represented in the violet line has non - trivial profile due to competing effects of primordial @xmath1 and @xmath0 , in particular it has zeroes associated with the presence of @xmath0 : if such features can be detected in the bispectrum profile , they can be used to help distinguishing among the effects of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the plot above is only indicative , in the sense that one should study in more detail the _ combined _ effects of non - linear gravity and primordial ng in shaping the bispectra , and not only comparing their relative amplitude . on the other hand ,",
    "it gives the idea that for interesting values of ng parameters the primordial contribution can lead to a rich profile for the bispectrum , controlled by the primordial ng parameters , with an amplitude larger or comparable to the one due to gravitational clustering only .",
    "primordial ng characterizes the interactions of the fields sourcing the density fluctuations that seed the large - scale structure of our universe . in this work , using a generalized univariate approach that we compared with other methods in the literature , we analytically and numerically investigated how the statistics of lss , in particular the study of bispectra of halos and matter , allow one to probe primordial ng .",

    "this investigation is important since although cmb constraints on @xmath1 have greatly improved with planck , it is not clear whether cmb measurements only can set stringent constraints on @xmath0 .    in the first part of this work",
    ", we showed analytically that the profiles of halo and matter bispectra have qualitative features that if measurable would clearly distinguish the effects of each non - gaussian parameter .",
    "we exploited the scale dependence of the halo bias induced by primordial ng .",
    "we worked in a simplified situation in which only linear bias and linear effects of gravitational clustering are taken into account , to single out the effects of primordial ng in the statistics of lss .",
    "we have shown that the profile of the halo bispectrum as a function of the scale , for isosceles configurations of triangles in momentum space , has properties that provide simple , qualitative information on each non - gaussian parameter .",
    "for example , the number and the position of the zeros of this function depend on the size of @xmath0 , and can be analytically computed with our formulae . if @xmath0 is present , and its sign is opposite with respect to the sign of @xmath1 , the number of zeros of the bispectra increases as a function of the scale .",
    "then , we determined a particular combination of halo and matter bispectra and power spectra , denoted @xmath101 , that is proportional to @xmath1 only and is ( nearly ) independent on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "a detection of this combination would be a clean probe of @xmath1 with no contaminations associated with @xmath0 .",
    "we then generalized our findings to the case in which multiple sources contribute to form the primordial density fluctuations , and studied how stochastic halo bias is affected by the presence of @xmath0 .",
    "we also provided new ways to study stochastic halo bias in terms of combinations of bispectra and power spectra .    in the second part of this work ,",
    "we numerically confirmed and further developed our analytical results , focussing on a press - schechter approach to halo formation supplemented by appropriate non - gaussian initial conditions .",

    "we confirmed our theoretical considerations , showing plots representing how the qualitative profiles of halo bispectra in suitable configurations depend on non - gaussian parameters , and might be used to set constraints on them .",
    "we ended our discussion with a preliminary analysis of the contributions of non - linear gravitational clustering , indicating that non - linear gravity tends to contaminate the bispectrum profiles , but that the qualitative features we investigated survive for sufficiently large primordial non - gaussian parameters .",
    "our results can be extended in various directions . from the theoretical side , the non - linear effects associated with features of the mass function , bias and gravitational clustering ( the non - linear transformation from lagrangian to eulerian coordinates ) , as well as loop effects ,",
    "should be properly included in the context of perturbation theory , in order to understand whether and how primordial ng controls the qualitative features of bispectra also after taking these non - linearities into account . having a good control of gravitational effects would also allow one to reliably study the bispectra for smaller values of the scale and for configurations that are less squeezed than the ones we considered here , and extend the validity of our results in these regimes .",
    "we plan to explore this interesting issue in a future publication .",
    "another direction of investigation is a more systematic study of observational applications of our results , trying to quantify whether the methods we propose are sufficiently efficient to set constraints on @xmath0 that are more stringent than those available from the cmb .",
    "an important extension of our work is thus to forecast the signal - to - noise of galaxy bispectra as a function of scale , for future surveys such as euclid , and thereby test whether the features we predict are observable .",

    "@xmath200 , while @xmath201 is the @xmath2-th order quantity of the linear density contrast , given by perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that non - linear evolution is automatically included when building the @xmath158-point function , even though calculations become harder .    on the other hand , the assumptions that led us to the halo density contrast of eq .",
    "are somewhat different .",
    "as we will show , the peak - background split method within a barrier crossing approach allows to re - obtain part of the results of @xcite in a simple way ( at least in the squeezed limit ) and extend them up to higher powers of ng parameters .",
    "however , since we have not yet accounted for the non - linear effects of gravity , a comparison is possible only between primordial ng effects at this stage .",
    "moreover , it is known ( see for example @xcite ) that the local lagrangian and eulerian bias are not compatible in non - linear regimes .    by plugging eqs .",

    "however , a subtle difference between our results and those of @xcite arise , due to the different initial assumptions .",
    "the matching is truly correct only if the equalities @xmath208 , @xmath209 hold : it would be interesting to understand the physical meaning of this fact .",

    "these additional terms appear naturally within our framework and suggest that higher powers of ng parameters can in principle dominate over the lower ones , extending what jeong and komatsu found for the ratio @xmath211 .",
    "all the contributions above are important for the specific features of the halo bispectrum discussed in section [ sec : gnllss ] .",
    "let us now compare our approach with the one by baldauf et al in @xcite .",

    "3 + b_11&=&b_g + b_02&=&3 _ 2 + b_20&=&0 they differ from the ones of @xcite for two reasons .",
    "the first reason is that , as explained in the main text , in our approach we decided to perform a taylor expansion at _ linear order _ in @xmath14 and on all its correlation functions in langrangian space . in this way we consider only non - linear effects induced by primordial ng , and we exclude non - linearities associated with higher derivatives of the mass function .",
    "this approximation is also justified by the fact that higher derivatives of the mass function along non - gaussian parameters are under less reliable theoretical control .",
    "the second reason is that we include also the effects of ( first ) derivatives of the mass function along @xmath1 ( that provide contributions proportional to @xmath138 ) that are instead neglected in a bivariate approach .",
    "hence , for example , the coefficient @xmath215 in eq ( [ eqb01 ] ) , using our definition of @xmath97 , @xmath138 reads b_01&=&+while the first term can be associated with the analogous result reported in @xcite , the second term is absent in their case .",
    "indeed , the bivariate approach produces the @xmath216 dependence in the bias of the halo - halo and halo - matter power spectra as a contribution from the trispectrum @xcite . on the other hand , our expression for @xmath217 is vanishing because we decided not to consider the second derivatives of @xmath35 along @xmath70 .",
    "for the same reason of not considering such second derivatives , various contributions in the remaining coefficients @xmath213 proportional to @xmath210 , found in @xcite are absent in our formulae .",
    "in this appendix we collect some technical results on inequalities among primordial non - gaussian parameters , that we use in section [ sec : stochastic ] .",
    "the most famous of these inequalities is dubbed suyama - yamaguchi inequality , and relates the collapsed limit of the 4-pt function with the square of the squeezed limit of a 3-pt function of a given fluctuation @xmath14 in fourier space @xcite [ nongi1 ] _ q0_k_1 _ -k_1-q _ k_2 _ -k_2+q  _ q0 using the definitions for @xmath4 and @xmath1 and specializing to the case of primordial curvature fluctuations , this inequality corresponds to the suyama - yamaguchi inequality .",

    "analogously , the collapsed limit of the 4-pt function can be expressed as @xmath222   [ \\delta^2 ] \\rangle$ ] . with the help of this notation , inequality ( [ nongi1 ] )",
    "succinctly reads [ nongi1b ]    in @xcite a simple proof of this inequality has been provided , by inserting a complete set of normalized momentum eigenstates @xmath223 into the quantity @xmath224   [ \\delta^2 ] \\rangle$ ] of the left hand side of ( [ nongi1b ] ) .",
    "the zero - momentum , long wavelength eigenstate provides the square of the squeezed 3pt function in the right hand side , to which one has to add the additional ( positive definite ) contributions that lead to the inequality above . in the collapsed limit and single source case , the additional contributions vanish and one saturates the inequality .",
    "although less explored in the literature , it is also possible to build further inequalities involving collapsed and squeezed limits of higher point functions ( see for example @xcite ) : the virtue of the method of @xcite is that the proofs of such inequalities can be straightforwardly generalized to those cases . as specific examples , we can write the following inequalities satisfied by five and six point functions , in appropriate collapsed limits    [ ^3 ] [ ^2 ] & & [ nongi2 ] + [ nongi3 ] [ ^3 ] [ ^3 ] & & using the methods of @xcite , it is relatively straightforward to prove that the inequalities saturate to equalities in the single source case .",

    "<S> the statistics of large - scale structure in the universe can be used to probe non - gaussianity of the primordial density field , complementary to existing constraints from the cosmic microwave background . in particular , the scale dependence of halo bias , which affects the halo distribution at large scales , represents a promising tool for analyzing primordial non - gaussianity of local form . </S>",
    "<S> future observations , for example , may be able to constrain the trispectrum parameter @xmath0 that is difficult to study and constrain using the cmb alone . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how galaxy and matter bispectra can distinguish between the two non - gaussian parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , whose effects give nearly degenerate contributions to the power spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we use a generalization of the univariate bias approach , making the hypothesis that the number density of halos forming at a given position is a function of the local matter density contrast and of its local higher - order statistics . using this approach , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the halo - matter bispectra and analyze their properties . </S>",
    "<S> we determine a connection between the sign of the halo bispectrum on large scales and the parameter @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also construct a combination of halo and matter bispectra that is sensitive to @xmath1 , with little contamination from @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we study both the case of single and multiple sources to the primordial gravitational potential , discussing how to extend the concept of stochastic halo bias to the case of bispectra . </S>",
