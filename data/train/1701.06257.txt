    "the motivation for defining the sequences , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , in definition [ def_afn_ani_matrix_seqs ] is to provide a compact notation for expressing the left - hand - side terms , @xmath37^{t}$ ] , of the matrix equation corresponding to the non - homogeneous recurrence relations for @xmath23 given in proposition [ prop_matrixequations_fi_eq_ainvbbm ] and in proposition [ prop_bn_recs ] ( see also lemma [ lemma_ls_partial_sum_exps ] on page ) .",

    "secondly , since the geometric series in @xmath81 is expanded by @xmath82 for all finite @xmath83 , we have by the first definition of @xmath26 in definition [ def_afn_ani_matrix_seqs ] that the first @xmath80 terms of the numerator expansion in are correct .",

    ", we can prove that @xmath90 satisfies a @xmath30-order finite difference equation with constant coefficients of the form @xcite @xmath91 then since we define @xmath92 for all @xmath93 in , and since the @xmath94 partial sums of @xmath8 generate @xmath95 for all @xmath71 by the lemma , and since @xmath96 for all @xmath97 , we see that implies our result .",
    "the proposition is a consequence of definition [ def_afn_ani_matrix_seqs ] applied to proposition [ prop_bn_recs ] . specifically , by rearranging terms in the result from the previous proposition , we see that @xmath98 where defines the sequence of @xmath99 . then by the definition of @xmath27 given in definition [ def_afn_ani_matrix_seqs ] , it is easy to see that @xmath34 is lower triangular with ones on its diagonals , and so is invertible for all @xmath24 .",
