    "recently the superconductivity of organic substances due to injection of charges by electric field in the field effect transistor ( fet ) was found @xcite .",
    "this new physical phenomenon is considered to be unusual in several aspects .",
    "first , unusual is the nature of the superconducting objects themselves : they are organic crystals , anthracene , phenanthrene and fullerene c@xmath0 .",
    "second , unusual is the superconductivity of the charges injected by electric field : up - to - date the superconductivity of organic crystals was related to the charge transfer , particularly , due to chemical doping .",
    "third , in the case of fullerene c@xmath0 the superconductivity is observed at extremely high temperature ( 52 k for pure c@xmath0 @xcite and at even 117 k when doping by bromoform @xcite ) .",
    "fourth , injecting holes into the fullerene leads to significantly higher critical temperature than at injecting electrons , although at chemical doping the c@xmath0 superconductivity is observed with negative charge carriers only .",
    "these findings give rise to the problem of physical mechanisms of the phenomena , in the first turn , including the question on the distribution of charge carriers in organic crystal . in the study",
    "@xcite the amount of induced charges per c@xmath0 molecule is estimated with the supposition that the additional charges occupy the surface monolayer only .    an almost complete surface localization of induced charges near superconducting concentration is predicted in @xcite .",
    "this study makes use of tight - binding model taking into account electron repulsion by mean field .",
    "however , in the case of fullerite , the hubbard repulsion @xmath1 on a c@xmath0 molecule is estimated to be 1 ev or more @xcite whereas the magnitude of the interfullerene hopping @xmath2 is below 50 mev @xcite .",
    "thus , the fullerite crystal , which characterized by the relation @xmath3 more than 20 , have to be classified as a system with very strong electron correlation .",
    "that is why the results obtained with the use of the one - electron tight - binding model should be taken with care .",
    "the above reasons motivate the present study of charge - profile problem in fullerite .",
    "we consider the problem from an opposite point of view that seems to be in better correspondence with the electronic characteristics of this material .",
    "we apply the approach earlier used by us for calculations of charge transfer in the fullerides a@xmath4c@xmath0 crystals @xcite .",
    "it is hopping smallness in comparison with electrostatic energies that is used to develop a simple scheme allowing us to calculate the charge distribution in the c@xmath0-based fet structure .",
    "as in ref.@xcite , we consider the fcc fullerite lattice with a ( 001 ) plane parallel to the gate .",
    "we are interesting in the distribution of injected charges between the ( 001 ) parallel layers of c@xmath0 molecules that forms square lattices with the side length @xmath5=10  a.    let @xmath6 be total number of extra electrons per molecule in layer @xmath7 , so their charge is @xmath8 ( the case of injected holes is represented by negative @xmath6 ) .",
    "we consider the system with the total numbers of layers @xmath9 , the surface layer is labeled by zero .",
    "the basic assumption of our model is neglecting the overlap between c@xmath0 molecules .",
    "accordingly , the total energy of the crystal is the sum of the energies of the separate layers of molecules that interact electrostatically .",
    "the energy @xmath10 per molecule in a layer @xmath7 with the potential @xmath11 is @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is energy of free molecule with @xmath6 extra electrons .",
    "this expression is accurate provided @xmath6 is integer , so @xmath13 can be treated as energies of c@xmath0 ions with corresponding charges . for noninteger @xmath6 , it is naturally assumed that @xmath13 can be interpolated by the quadratic fit , @xmath14 then the minimum condition of total energy with respect to @xmath6 leads to equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a lagrange multiplier taking into account the additional restriction of fixing total electron number @xmath17 from the other side , the layer potentials are , in turn , related to the charges by the poisson equations . because of negligible hopping , as it is adopted in our model , the c@xmath0 molecules interact only electrostatically and can be represented by point charges due to their near spherical form .",
    "according to ref.@xcite , the potential @xmath11 of layer n is determined by the equation @xmath18 where the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 are expressed through c@xmath0 dielectric constant @xmath21 and the distance @xmath5 between neighboring molecules @xmath22 excluding @xmath11 from ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) one obtains the system of linear inhomogeneous equations that determine , together with the condition ( 4 ) , the charge densities @xmath6 , @xmath23 where parameter @xmath24 is defined by the equality @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a new constant . as it can be seen from eq.(7 ) at @xmath27 , this constant is in close relationship to the charge density in surface layer , @xmath28 .    to treat the system ( 7 ) ,",
    "let us write it in the matrix form @xmath29 where * i * is unit matrix , * v * is the column vector all the components of which are units , and * a * is @xmath30 matrix of form @xmath31 to find @xmath6 , let us solve the eigenvalue problem of the matrix * a * , @xmath32 where * x * is square matrix the column of which are eigenvectors of * a * and @xmath33 is diagonal matrix of corresponding eigevalues",
    ". then one can obtain from ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) @xmath34    eq.(12 ) shows that the shape of charge profile defined by the relative charge distribution , is independent on @xmath35 .",
    "obtaining @xmath6 at any @xmath36 , they are normalized to @xmath35 , thus satisfying the additional condition ( 4 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath37/@xmath35 determines the relative part of injected charge below the surface layer of the crystal .",
    "its dependence on the parameter @xmath38 is depicted in fig.[fig1 ] , as the result of calculations with @xmath39=50 .",
    "we consider only range @xmath40 where the solutions have physical meaning and all the @xmath6 has the same sign as the constant c in ( 12 ) .",
    "the fig.[fig1 ] shows that the charge density at @xmath410 is completely localized on the surface molecules .",
    "as @xmath38 rises , the charges markedly expands into deeper layers . to obtain numerical estimations in real c@xmath0",
    "crystal one should evaluate only @xmath38 in the approximation ( 2 ) .",
    "considering the latter as a fit to the ground - state energies of c@xmath0 molecule and its ions one obtains the following estimations of @xmath38 for injected charges of both signs @xmath42 where @xmath43 are electron affinities and @xmath44 are ionization potentials with known experimental values ( in ev ) @xcite : @xmath45 using the estimation of parameter @xmath19 in ( 6 ) @xmath19 = 2.9 ev @xcite , we obtain @xmath20 = 3.9@xmath46 = 1.27 ev . with above estimations of @xmath38 the degree of charge delocalization @xmath37/@xmath35",
    "is evaluated as 0.266 for electrons and 0.359 for holes , as it is illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] . in other words ,",
    "about one quarter of injected electron charge and one third of hole charges turns out to be beneath the surface layer of c@xmath0 crystal .    the calculated charge distributions between the layers for electrons and holes in the @xmath47 crystal",
    "is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "it is clear that the injected charge densities fall with the distance from the surface strictly exponentialy in both cases , with the electron density dropping more rapidly than hole one .    to conclude",
    ", we summarize the main differences of our results from obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "( i ) the charge profile in @xcite substantially depends on the charge concentration whereas our relative distribution is independent of it .",
    "( ii ) according to @xcite 98 % of the total charge is confined to the surface layer for doping @xmath35 higher than 0.3 , in opposite to our calculations showing this degree less than 75 % at any doping .",
    "the both results are in qualitative agreement with respect to domination of injected charges in the top layer . at the same time , our calculations show the possible nonnegligible occupation of undersurface layers .",
    "the question on their role in the conductivity properties of fullerite in fet structures needs in a separate consideration in future .",
    "however , just now our results suggest that the existing estimations of charge concentration providing the highest @xmath48 in superconductive fet structures may be subject to refinement .",
