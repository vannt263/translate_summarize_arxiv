    "@xcite , the reason that the bell - chsh violation increases monotonically in the case of the parity measurement but not in the case of the on - off measurement can be explained as follows .",
    "when the average photon number of the symmetric ecs is sufficiently large , it can be represented as a maximally entangled two - qubit state in a @xmath59 hilbert space spanned by the even and odd scs basis ( @xmath10 ) and the displacement operator well approximates the qubit rotation .",

    "in contrast , the photon number on - off measurement can not cause bell violations for large amplitudes because the vacuum weight in the state almost vanishes in the limit of @xmath60  @xcite .    as implied by the apparent overlaps between the cases of symmetric ecss ( solid curve ) and those of the asymmetric ecss ( dotted ) ,",
