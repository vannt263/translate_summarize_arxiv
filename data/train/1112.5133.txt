    "in measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc )  @xcite , an algorithm proceeds entirely by making projective measurements of successive particles ( qubits or qudits ) comprising some highly entangled ` resource state . '",
    "while two - dimensional cluster states are known to be universal resources for mbqc  @xcite , it has been proven that they can not be the unique ground states of any qubit hamiltonian involving at most two - body interactions  @xcite . because two - body interactions are generic in nature ,",
    "this limitation has driven a search for other universal resource states that might exist as the ground state of a physical system .",
    "an alternative representation of mbqc using matrix product states ( mps )  @xcite in one dimension and its extension to higher dimensions using projected entangled pair states ( peps )  @xcite indicates that there are many states with much less entanglement than the cluster states that are nevertheless universal resources  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the fraction of useful resource states is known to be exponentially small in the number of physical qubits  @xcite .",
    "worse , it is presently unknown if any of these states is the unique , gapped ground state of any physically realizable hamiltonian . by relaxing various assumptions ,",
    "it is possible to define accessible hamiltonians whose ground states are universal resources for mbqc .",
    "one example is a system of spin-5/2 qudits on the hexagonal lattice with two - body interactions , where the ground state is unique and gapped  @xcite .",
    "another is the aklt model of an antiferromagnet@xcite with spin-3/2 qudits on the hexagonal lattice , which is gapped but degenerate  @xcite",
    ".    an unrelated strategy for mbqc was devised for indistinguishable free fermions using beam splitters and charge detectors  @xcite in analogy with non - deterministic linear optical quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "in fact , cluster states can be dynamically generated using this approach  @xcite .",
    "the relationship between free fermions and entanglement has subsequently been the subject of extensive investigations  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the relationships between fermions and quantum information are being explored  @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that quantum circuits composed only of matchgates  @xcite ( which are closely related to non - interacting fermions ) can generate entanglement yet are efficiently classically simulatable unless supplemented by an apparently trivial resource , the unentangling swap gate  @xcite .    in this work , the ideas above are combined to show that the non - degenerate and gapped ground state of a non - interacting fermionic lattice hamiltonian is equivalent to a cluster state comprised of qubits , under the conditions that any site has at most one fermion and the lattice is exactly half - filled .",
    "the qubit registers then correspond to the occupation of lattice sites .",
    "the entanglement is a direct consequence of fermionic indistinguishability and antisymmetry .",
    "measurements correspond to detecting the presence or absence of a fermion in a lattice site , equivalent to a restriction to the computational basis . in order to simulate a universal quantum computer",
    ", one must rotate the measurement from the computational @xmath0 basis into the @xmath1 or @xmath2 basis via the application of a hadamard gate @xmath3 or a @xmath4 operation ( here @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 represent the pauli matrices ) .",
    "surprisingly , in the fermionic model these gates can not be directly implemented because of the intrinsic entanglement ; rather , an additional lattice must be introduced that allows two fermions encoding different qubits to interact , thereby cancelling the effects of the fermionic antisymmetry .",
    "fermionic systems therefore invert the usual quantum computing paradigm , in that entanglement is intrinsic but general single - qubit operations require particle interactions .",

    "the stabilizers of a given state @xmath5 are the operators @xmath6 for which one satisfies @xmath7 for each @xmath8",
    ". if @xmath5 is a stabilizer state , then its hilbert space dimension exactly coincides with the number of stabilizers @xmath6 .",
    "a useful class of stabilizer states are known as graph states , where qubits are represented by vertices and maximal two - qubit entanglement between two qubits is represented by an edge connecting the vertices . for a generic graph state @xmath9 on @xmath10 qubits ,",
    "the @xmath10 generators for the @xmath11-dimensional group of stabilizers are given by the separable operators @xmath12 , where @xmath13 signifies the neighbourhood of site ( qubit ) @xmath8 , and where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 denote pauli matrices acting on qubit @xmath8 .",
    "a hamiltonian that is guaranteed to have @xmath9 as the lowest energy state ( with eigenvalue @xmath17 ) is therefore @xmath18 for cluster states , in which the qubits are arranged on a regular lattice , the coordination number is two and four for one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices , respectively .",
    "this implies that the hamiltonian above consists of three - spin and five - spin operators in 1d and 2d , respectively .",
    "in fact , this number has been proven to be a minimum , i.e.   there is no hamiltonian having all terms with fewer spin operations that can have @xmath9 as a ( non - degenerate ) ground state  @xcite .    in the one - dimensional case , the cluster ground state is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the maximally entangling controlled - phase gate and",
    "@xmath21 is the @xmath22 eigenstate of the @xmath1 operator . in this representation",
    ", it is evident that the cluster state is highly entangled : each qubit is maximally entangled with its neighbor .",
    "the excited states correspond to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , and have energies @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "the energy gap to the first excited state is therefore @xmath27 , constant in the thermodynamic limit .    to perform universal quantum computation",

    "the presence of the @xmath1 gate reflects the probabilistic nature of the measurement outcome .",
    "three successive measurements with three independent angles ( adapted to previous measurements because of the possible presence of an @xmath1 gate ) suffices to teleport an arbitrary single - qubit gate in 1d cluster states ; a universal set of gates results in 2d cluster states  @xcite .",
    "the fermionic model employed in this work is inspired by experiments with ultracold atomic gases .",
    "numerous groups have confined both bosonic and fermionic atoms in periodic potentials formed from interfering lasers , known as optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "these lattices can confine different spin components of the same bosonic species in independent , overlapping optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the structure of these lattices is highly flexible  @xcite , and periodic double - well potentials for bosons have been been the subject of particularly intense investigations  @xcite . in another recent development , an ultracold gas consisting of a mixture of three different spin components of the fermionic atom @xmath35li",
    "has been realized in an optical trap  @xcite .",
    "ultracold fermionic gases of both @xmath36k and @xmath35li have been loaded into periodic optical lattices with highly controllable geometries and trapping parameters  @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that these various techniques could be combined in the future , with multicomponent fermions in three overlapping double - well optical lattices , each confining a different spin component .",
    "consider the potentials depicted in fig .",
    "1(a ) , corresponding to three overlapping one - dimensional two - site lattices .",
    "it is assumed that each sublattice can confine only one particular spin projection of a fermion with pseudospin @xmath37 ( corresponding to real spin @xmath38 with all but three spin projections frozen out ) ; the spin projections will be labeled @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . the potential shown as a black curve is assumed to confine only the spin @xmath40 , and could be obtained using two potentials with amplitudes @xmath42 and @xmath43 and with one wavelength @xmath44 half as large as another : @xmath45 likewise , the potentials seen by the @xmath39 and @xmath41 spin projections ( green and red curves in fig .",
    "[ pots](a ) , respectively ) would be generated by wavelengths that were twice as long as for projection @xmath40 , and offset relative to each other : @xmath46 the relative height of the barriers is then set by the ratio @xmath47 . within the tight - binding approximation , assuming the atoms can only tunnel through the lower barrier of a given sublattice ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath48 where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) creates ( annihilates ) a fermion with spin projection @xmath51 at site @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath52 correspond to hopping amplitudes , the exact values of which are unimportant for the present work .",
    "there is no tunneling permitted between different sublattices , but nevertheless fermions with different spin projections must anticommute if the sublattices overlap : if a fermion with one spin projection tunnels past a fermion with another spin projection , the total wavefunction picks up a negative sign .",
    "this is because it is impossible to distinguish if the fermions interchanged their spin labels ( switching places ) during the transit , or remained the same . at the same time , it is unnecessary to impose antisymmetrization on fermions that can never overlap in practice .",
    "for example , a @xmath40-projection fermion in site 1 in fig .",
    "1(b ) needs to be antisymmetrized only with fermions in sites 2 , 3 , and 4 ; the tunneling barrier between sites 4 and 5 is assumed to be so large as to prevent any tunneling for @xmath40-spin projection atoms .",
    "the relative strengths of the tunneling amplitudes are not important for the ground state , as long as they are all non - zero .",
    "one may assume that the system is given sufficiently long to equilibrate compared to the tunneling rates .",
    "thus one may choose @xmath53 without loss of generality .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ hamalt0 ] ) can be further simplified by noting that fermions with a given spin projection are constrained to their respective sublattices .",
    "the spin - projection index can therefore be suppressed , corresponding to spinless ( fully polarized ) fermions .",
    "one then obtains the equivalent ` leapfrog ' hamiltonian @xmath54 which is the central model of the current work , and is depicted graphically in fig .",
    "though the hamiltonian appears to involve third - nearest neighbor hopping , it is in fact obtained by nearest - neighbor hopping on an array of three overlapping two - site sublattices .",
    "consider only the case where each spinless sublattice is exactly half - filled : each connected double - well indexed by @xmath55 contains exactly one fermion , @xmath56 .",
    "mathematically , this could be accomplished by applying a suitable projector to the hamiltonian  ( [ hamalt ] ) . in an experiment with ultracold atoms ,",
    "such a configuration could be obtained by detecting and selectively moving or removing single atoms  @xcite .",
    "making use of the jordan - wigner transformation @xmath57 the hamiltonian  ( [ hamalt ] ) may be expressed in the spin representation : @xmath58 which is four - local in marked contrast to that in the fermion representation .",
    "because of the half - filling restriction , the ground state only involves states with hamming weight @xmath10 and therefore only involves combinations of the encoded registers @xmath59 where the state @xmath60 represents the particle vacuum . in other words",
    ", the @xmath61 register has the single fermion on the first site of a given double - well indexed by @xmath55 , while the @xmath62 register corresponds to the fermion in the second site .",
    "one can introduce an encoded basis where the operators become @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ( recall the half - filling condition ) , i.e.  @xmath66 and vice versa , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "using @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the hamiltonian  ( [ hamaltspin ] ) in the encoded basis becomes @xmath71 with @xmath72 . applying the unitary transformation @xmath73 for all @xmath74 performs the maps @xmath75 , transforming ( [ hamaltspin2 ] ) into exactly the same hamiltonian as the one - dimensional cluster - state hamiltonian on @xmath10 qubits , eq .",
    "( [ hamstab ] ) .",
    "the ground state of hamiltonian  ( [ hamaltspin2 ] ) is therefore immediately obtained by comparing with the usual cluster state , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cluster ] ) : @xmath76 , and the encoded entangling gate is defined as @xmath77 in the space spanned by the vectors @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "it is clear that the ground state is equivalent to the one - dimensional cluster state , where each qubit is maximally entangled to its neighbor .",
    "this entanglement is a direct consequence of fermionic antisymmetry and indistinguishability .",
    "the excitations correspond to @xmath82 operations on the ground state , which cost energy @xmath27 .",
    "the energy gap is therefore @xmath27 , independent of system size .",
    "consider the consequences of measuring the position of one of the two fermions in a two - qubit fermionic cluster state .",
    "suppose that the entire system consisted of sites 1 , 3 , 4 , and 6 in fig .",
    "1(b ) . in the absence of inert fermions in the unpaired sites 2 and 5 ,",
    "these sites can be ignored , and the ground state of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamalt ] ) is maximally entangled : @xmath83 in the fermi - occupation notation , the ground state appears to be separable ; however , this ignores the fact that fermions on sites 3 and 4 must anticommute if there is any chance that these fermions can interchange .",
    "consequently , defining the fermionic occupation states in the natural ordering by increasing label @xmath84 , a negative sign appears on the second line above .",
    "if the fermions on site - pairs @xmath85 and @xmath86 could never overlap ( i.e.  there was an impenetrable barrier between them ) , then the state would be truly separable and no explicit antisymmetrization would be required .",
    "measurement of the first qubit in encoded state @xmath87 corresponds to the application of the projector @xmath88 , yielding @xmath89 yields the state @xmath90\\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\underline{z}_1|\\underline{1}\\mbox{\\boldmath $ + $ } \\rangle = -|\\underline{1}\\mbox{\\boldmath $ -$}\\rangle.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dependence of the second encoded qubit s output state on the outcome of the first encoded qubit s measurement is a direct consequence of the entanglement of the original fermionic state .",
    "it is important to note , and easy to verify , that this result does nt depend on how one labels the sites .",
    "if the two double - sites were instead labeled @xmath91 and @xmath92 , so that no negative sign appeared in the ground state  ( [ gsex ] ) , the same states would still be obtained after measurement .",
    "this is because the result of the measurement operation on the double - site @xmath91 explicitly depends on the possible existence of a fermion at the intervening site 4 . if instead the two double - wells were disconnected ( non - overlapping )",
    ", then there would be no intervening site with which to anticommute , and therefore no dependence of the output on the measurement outcome .",
    "in short , the entanglement arises from the fundamental requirement that fermions on the sites 3 and 4 must anticommute when there is the potential for these wavefunctions to overlap .",
    "in order to perform universal gate teleportation using the encoded cluster state , eq .",
    "( 10 ) in the manuscript , it is important to derive expressions for the encoded @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95-rotations , hadamard operator @xmath96 , and measurement operators that one would need to apply in order to teleport gates with fermions .",

    "nevertheless they are fully separable ( i.e.  not entangling ) , as will be shown explicitly in the example below .",

    "if there were in fact one fermion occupying either of the intervening sites @xmath116 or @xmath117 , then hopping between @xmath114 and @xmath115 would introduce undesired negative signs to certain matrix elements .",

    "<S> entanglement between the constituents of a quantum system is an essential resource in the implementation of many quantum processes and algorithms . indeed , universal quantum computation is possible by measuring individual qubits comprising highly entangled ` cluster states . ' in this work it is shown that the unique gapped ground state of non - interacting fermions hopping on a specially prepared lattice is equivalent to a cluster state , where the entanglement between qubits results solely by fermionic indistinguishability and antisymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> a deterministic strategy for universal measurement - based quantum computation with this resource is described . </S>",
    "<S> because most matter is composed of fermions , these results suggest that resources for quantum information processing might be generic in nature . </S>"
