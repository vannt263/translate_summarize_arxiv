    "how much of the galaxy s halo was accreted from satellite galaxies ? what fraction of these accretions have left substructure that we can detect today ?",
    "hierarchial galaxy formation pictures @xcite suggest that structure forms first in small clumps which later combine to make larger galaxies .",
    "while this picture describes dark matter rather than stars , it is reasonable to expect that some stars would have formed in these dense clumps of matter at early times .",
    "this is borne out by the fact that almost all of the local group dwarf galaxies contain stars with ages greater than 10 gyr @xcite . in studies of the milky way , the first suggestion that the galaxy s halo did not form in a fast , uniform collapse @xcite was made by @xcite , who noted that the horizontal - branch morphology of the outer halo globulars could be explained by a younger mean age .",
    "these clusters would have originated in `` transient protogalactic fragments that continued to fall into ...... the galaxy for some time after the collapse of its central regions '' .",
    "strong variations in the galaxy s potential associated with the formation of the inner disk and bar , plus the shorter orbital timescales there , may have erased the kinematic signature of halo accretion in its inner regions .",
    "substructure may persist for many gyr further from the galactic center @xcite .",
    "we see evidence for accretion not only in the sgr dwarf galaxy , which is being tidally disrupted on its current passage close to the galaxy s disk @xcite , but also in the detection of various moving groups in the halo field @xcite .",
    "these latter objects are particularly interesting and surprising because they are at relatively small distances from the galactic center ( 810 kpc ) .",
    "figure [ disthist](a ) shows in histogram form the numbers of distant halo objects known to date .",
    "globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies are not included .",
    "it is not surprising , with such small samples , that almost all the discoveries of halo substructure to date have been serendipitous . in this paper",
    ", we will describe a survey which will give a _ quantitative _ answer to the question `` how much of the halo was accreted ? '' by identifying a sample comprising a large number of halo stars out to great distances .",
    "( figure [ disthist](b ) shows how the situation has improved after our first spectroscopic followup run on the kpno 4 m . )    in section 2 we discuss the design of our survey and the tracers we use , together with the region of the halo that each tracer will sample .",
    "section 3 discusses our photometric selection technique in detail for each tracer , showing its efficacy with spectra of stars found in each category .",
    "we also discuss the possible contaminants of our sample and how we reject them .",
    "section 4 uses the numbers of turnoff stars found by our survey in various directions to constrain the density distribution of the halo .",
    "we also report the first evidence of spatial substructure in the halo .",
    "future papers in this series will discuss our simulations of the breakup of satellites and their observational consequences @xcite , our photometric survey @xcite , our spectroscopy of distant metal - poor giants and bhb stars @xcite and evidence for spatial substructure in our photometric data @xcite .",
    "because substructure is visible in velocity space long after it disappears in density space @xcite , we aim to obtain velocity data on a large sample of halo stars .",
    "@xcite discuss the signature that tidally disrupting streams will show in velocity histograms : although the observed signature does depend on the viewing geometry and initial conditions of the accretion , in many cases velocity histograms will be bimodal or multi - modal .",
    "the features that correspond to disrupted satellites will show a velocity dispersion of order tens of kilometers per second .",
    "since substructure will survive longest in the outer galaxy , distant halo tracers are advantageous .",
    "if we restrict our spectroscopic follow - up to 4m - class telescopes , this means that halo red giants and blue horizontal branch stars are the tracers of choice because of their intrinsic luminosity .",
    "however , these stars are intrinsically rare , and so they limit our detection methods for substructure  for example , it is impossible to find a sample of 100 halo giants in a field of size 1 deg@xmath1 .",
    "samples of this size are needed for methods of substructure detection based on velocity histograms . in order to have more sensitivity to subtle signatures of accretion",
    ", we also need tracers which are more numerous , such as halo turnoff stars .",
    "we shall , however , not be able to probe the extreme outer halo with these less luminous stars until 8m - class telescopes are more generally available .",
    "the stellar halo provides a very small fraction of the milky way s luminosity  in the solar neighborhood , the disk - to - halo star number ratio is @xmath2800:1 , @xcite , and even the thick disk outnumbers the halo by @xmath240:1 .",
    "thus it is important to use a method which will _ efficiently _ pre - select halo stars before obtaining velocities .",
    "when aiming to answer a question about the origin of the entire halo , all - sky coverage would be ideal .",
    "@xcite discuss such a survey for halo substructure , which , unfortunately , is not feasible at present .",
    "existing all - sky surveys based on photographic plates can not produce photometry accurate enough to efficently select halo objects apart from rare blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "any spatial substructure in the halo will be washed out by the many foreground disk and thick disk stars in a photographic survey .",
    "the sloan survey @xcite plans to cover one quarter of the sky at high galactic latitude in the north .",
    "the photometry from this survey will be sufficiently accurate to enable the identification of halo turnoff stars and bhb stars , but not the rare distant red halo giants we discuss below .",
    "these stars , which will be inseparably contaminated by foreground k dwarfs in the sloan colors , are particularly valuable for this project because they probe the extreme outer halo .",
    "we have chosen to use a pencil - beam survey of various high - latitude fields , using ccd photometry and the washington system to select the halo stars , and then carry out follow - up spectroscopy to search for kinematic substructure .    even with the most extreme hypothesis that the entire halo is composed of tidal streams ,",
    "their filling factor on the sky will still be small .",
    "some fields will therefore contain more stars than the average and some considerably fewer .",
    "a large number of different pointings is preferable to maximize the chance of hitting a single stream .",
    "for example , assuming a typical dimension for a stream of 2 degrees by 100 degrees , 50 of these would cover only 25 percent of the sky .",
    "we have chosen to survey initially 100 square degrees of the sky , in 100 different fields randomly distributed at high galactic latitude ( generally above @xmath3 ) , with most fields having galactic longitude between 90 and 270 .",
    "we chose in general to stay away from the quadrants which include the galactic center for two reasons .",
    "first , structure is more readily destroyed close to the galactic center , which lowers our chance of detecting it .",
    "the best place to look for substructure is the outer halo , where dynamical times are long and tidal forces small .",
    "thus , the galactic anticenter is better since the galactocentric radii of the stars we detect will be larger .",
    "second , there are many components represented at the galactic center  young and old disk , thick disk and bar , as well as the inner halo .",
    "interpretation of our results would be more complex there due to the dynamical effect of the bar .",
    "the metal - weak tail of the thick disk is also minimized when we look at higher latitudes .",
    "traditional ways of searching for halo stars include :    * proper motion surveys @xcite .",
    "these surveys identify stars at most a few hundred pc away , except for the surveys of @xcite and @xcite , which produced complete proper motion information on a sample of stars to b=22.5 and 19 respectively ( a maximum distance of 30 kpc ) .",
    "* rr lyrae surveys @xcite .",
    "these surveys sample more distant objects , but because of their extreme rarity  of order one per deg@xmath1 few distant rr lyraes are known . *",
    "objective prism surveys , generally for metal - poor giants or stars near the main sequence turnoff . @xcite . because of the relatively high resolution needed to identify these stars spectroscopically , these surveys are in general restricted to relatively bright magnitudes and therefore relatively nearby objects .",
    "* blue horizontal - branch ( bhb ) star surveys .",
    "the bhb stars are identified either from their unusually blue color @xcite or by using objective prism spectra near the ca k line @xcite .",
    "bhb stars are almost as rare as rr lyrae variables , and their identification is complicated by the presence of halo blue stragglers , which have the same broadband colors as bhb stars but higher gravity . as norris and hawkins show , the blue straggler fraction may be as high as 50% for samples of faint blue stars . *",
    "carbon stars .",
    "these are extremely rare stars ( of order one per 200 deg@xmath1 , totten and irwin 1998 ) which are identified easily from objective - prism spectra .",
    "@xcite review the currently known halo carbon stars and their properties .",
    "distances are more uncertain for these stars than for any other tracer we have discussed .",
    "halo tracers we chose to use are :    * red giants .",
    "these are identified photometrically using a luminosity indicator based on the mg  @xmath4/mgh feature at 5170   plus a metallicity indicator based on line blanketing near 4000  , with spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "* blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars , identified by their color plus a spectroscopic check of gravity . * stars at the main sequence turnoff , identifiable from their blue color  the most metal - poor globular clusters have turnoff colors of @xmath50.38 , while the thick disk turnoff is @xmath50.5 , so stars with colors between these two values are most likely halo turnoff stars . * blue metal - poor stars @xcite , which are halo field stars with colors bluer than = 0.38 , thought to be younger main sequence stars . when found in globular clusters , such stars",
    "are typically referred to as blue stragglers and may have a different origin from the field analogs .",
    "we will discuss these tracers , and possible contaminants in our sample , below .",
    "we reject another halo tracer , rr lyrae variables , because of the large amount of telescope time needed to identify and phase these variable stars .",
    "our technique reliably identifies both turnoff stars from the halo and the more distant halo giants and bhb stars . because of their different luminosities , these objects probe different regions of the galactic halo .",
    "turnoff stars can only reach to galactocentric distances of 1520 kpc using 4m - class telescopes for spectroscopic followup , while red giants and bhb stars will reach to distances of more than 100 kpc . however , due both to shorter evolutionary timescales for giants and to the strong decrease in halo density with galactocentric distance ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 , zinn 1985 , saha 1985 ) , there are far fewer halo giants detected than turnoff stars .",
    "different techniques are therefore used to search for the kinematic signatures of accretion . for the more numerous turnoff stars , we use statistical techniques based on the appearance of the velocity histogram ( testing for multimodality , for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "for the rarer red giants , we use the technique of @xcite ( see also lynden - bell 1999 ) to search for stars with similar energies and angular momenta , indicating a common origin .",
    "our initial survey was done using the burrell and curtis schmidt telescopes , which have ccd fields of order 1 deg@xmath1 .",
    "the burrell schmidt is fitted with a back - illuminated site 2048@xmath84096 ccd with 1.5 arcsec per pixel , while the curtis schmidt ( often ) has a 2048@xmath82048 back - illuminated tek ccd with 2.4 arcsec per pixel .",
    "now that large mosaics are available , we have extended the survey using the ctio 4 m with the btc ( field = 0.25 deg@xmath1 ) and the 8-ccd noao mosaics .",
    "our spectroscopic followup observations have been made using the hydra multiobject fiber spectrograph on the 3.5 m wiyn telescope and the rc spectrograph on the kpno 4 m .",
    "future observations with the hydra spectrograph on the ctio 4 m and the magellan telescope are planned .",
    "the washington photometric system combines strong metallicity sensitivity for late - type giants with broad filter passbands , which contribute to observing efficiency .",
    "we use this system for our survey , as its filters can be used for selection of all the other tracers we need as well .",
    "we describe transformations between the washington system and the bvi system in the appendix .    in each survey field ( of area approx 1 deg@xmath1 )",
    "we obtain photometry using a modified washington @xcite filter set ( c , m , 51 and i filters ) .",
    "the large pixel area on the schmidt telescopes leads to a high sky level in the i band .",
    "thus we use the sloan i filter , whose passband avoids the worst of the bright sky lines in the i band , in place of the washington @xmath9  or i filters .",
    "this i filter transforms readily to the washington system .",
    "typical exposure times using back - illuminated ccds and the 24-inch schmidt telescopes are 6000 sec in c and m , 8400 sec in 51 , and 4800 sec in i. on the ctio 4 m with the btc mosaic , exposure times were 100 sec in m , 500 sec in c , 120 sec in @xmath9  and 250 in 51 .",
    "these give typical errors of 0.015 mag . in each filter for a v=19 star .",
    "our photometry will be discussed in more detail by @xcite .",
    "we have used the data of @xcite to estimate the values of reddening in our fields , and de - reddened the washington colors according to the prescriptions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the reddening values are small , so this did not have a strong effect on our results in any case .",
    "figure [ cmd ] shows a typical color - magnitude diagram with the position of the halo and thick disk turnoffs marked .",
    "since each tracer requires a different selection technique , we will discuss them separately .",
    "this tracer is the most exciting since it allows us to probe the extreme outer halo .",
    "these stars have been little used in the past because they are greatly outnumbered by foreground k dwarfs , and it is difficult to distinguish k dwarfs from giants without accurate intermediate - band photometry or spectroscopy .",
    "however , their potential is enormous : a metal - poor star near the giant branch tip with @xmath10=2 and @xmath11=19.5 ( easily observable at medium resolution on a 4m - class telescope ) has a distance of 200 kpc !",
    "the combination of large ccd fields with the washington photometric system makes the detection of such objects feasible for the first time .",
    "these distant halo giants are rare . using the simple model of @xcite , we find that there are of order 110 halo giants per square degree down to v=20 , using a range of assumptions about the halo density distribution . in section 4",
    "we will show that out to galactocentric distances of 20 kpc , the halo density law is well described by a flattened power - law with exponent 3.0 and flattening b / a=0.6 .",
    "if this density law continues to larger distances , we would expect to see 4 halo giants deg@xmath12  brighter than v=20 at the ngp and 5 deg@xmath12  in an anticenter field with galactic latitude 45@xmath13 .",
    "there are three classes of objects found in the same range of color and magnitude as the halo giants we wish to find :    * numerous k dwarfs of the thin and thick disk , which can be detected using a photometric survey ( @xmath14  color ) * extremely metal - poor halo dwarfs , which are present in comparable numbers to halo giants for @xmath0 , and need a good follow - up spectrum ( with s / n@xmath215 ) to distinguish from halo giants . * background objects such as compact galaxies and qsos , which are easily weeded out using a low s / n followup spectrum .",
    "the major source of contamination of a halo giant sample is foreground k dwarfs . to quantify the numbers of foreground",
    "dwarfs that we will need to weed out , we have estimated their number using a modified version of the bahcall - soniera model which includes both thin disk and thick disk , using a 5% normalization for the thick disk .",
    "this predicts 70 thin disk dwarfs and 90 thick disk dwarfs ( @xmath15 @xmath16 ) per deg@xmath1 at the ngp .",
    "classical spectroscopic luminosity indicators ( originally developed for pop .",
    "i stars , eg seitter 1970 ) which are useful for our survey include :    * the mg  @xmath4  triplet and mgh band near 5200 .",
    "these features are much stronger in dwarfs than giants in this color range .",
    "they begin to lose sensitivity to luminosity blueward of  = 0.9 ( @xmath17=1.2 ) .",
    "these features are also temperature sensitive . *",
    "the ca i resonance line at 4227   shows marked sensitivity to both luminosity and temperature in k stars .",
    "its strength increases as temperature and luminosity decrease .",
    "since we have an independent photometric measure of temperature from @xmath17  color , we can use the ca i 4227   line as a luminosity indicator . * the blue and uv cn bands ( bandheads at 4216 and 3883  ) are strong in giants and not in dwarfs .",
    "the bands become weaker with decreasing metallicity , and are not visible below [ fe / h ] = 1.5 .",
    "we have observed metal - poor dwarfs and giants in order to check whether these indicators retain their usefulness for more metal - poor stars .",
    "our observations , plus those of the metal - weak giants we found , will be discussed in more detail by @xcite .",
    "we use the mg  @xmath4/mgh region as our major method of rejecting disk dwarfs in our sample via photometric selection .",
    "@xcite augmented the original washington system with the ddo `` 51 '' filter , an intermediate - band filter centered on the mg  @xmath4   and mgh features near 5200   , to give luminosity sensitivity for late g and k giants .",
    "the @xmath14  color gives a photometric method of measuring the strength of these features .",
    "figures [ mgb / h](a)(d ) show the strength of the mgh feature in spectra of dwarfs of solar and lower metallicity , and of the mg  @xmath4  feature for giants of different metallicity . most of these stars do not have direct measures of @xmath17color .",
    "we transformed to washington colors from existing @xmath18  or colors , using the method discussed in the appendix .",
    "for ease of display we have sorted the stars into bins of metallicity and color .",
    "table [ lumrefs ] gives sources of metallicity and color for all the stars shown in fig .",
    "[ mgb / h ] .",
    "these spectra clearly illustrate the luminosity indicators discussed above .",
    "a strong mgh band is seen for dwarfs with @xmath17  = 1.2 .",
    "the feature becomes weaker as temperature increases , until it is hard to see in the dwarfs with @xmath17  = 1.0 .",
    "although we do not have any spectra for dwarfs redder than @xmath17  = 1.3 , the mgh band continues to strengthen with decreasing temperature . for all except the reddest giants ( @xmath17@xmath19 ) there is no mgh feature visible , and the mg  @xmath4  lines are weak . for @xmath17of 1.45 and",
    "redder , there is a slight mgh feature visible for the giants with [ fe / h ] = 1.0 and above .",
    "our main method of detecting foreground dwarfs photometrically is via these features ( mgh + mg b ) .",
    "other spectral features which are useful for luminosity discrimination with a follow - up spectrum are the ca i 4227   line and the cn bands .",
    "the ca i 4227   line is visible in all the dwarf spectra , and can be seen to increase in strength as temperature decreases .",
    "it is also visible in the spectra of the metal - poor giants ( especially above [ fe / h ] = 1.5 ) but is much weaker than in dwarfs of the same color .",
    "blue and uv cn bands are visible in the metal - richer giants ( for example m71 stars l-1 ,",
    "s232 ) and will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "the 51 filter gives us the ability to measure the strength of the mgh feature and reject the numerous foreground dwarfs .",
    "precise photometry is necessary , however : @xcite obtained @xmath14  colors for a sample of metal - rich and metal - poor giants , and predominantly metal - rich dwarfs .",
    "he showed that giants and metal - rich dwarfs differ by at least 0.10 mag in m-51 color for @xmath20 0.85 , and that the difference becomes more pronounced between metal - poor giants ( with weaker mg  @xmath4 ) and metal - rich dwarfs .",
    "figure [ m51mt2 ] shows @xmath14colors for known dwarf and giant stars .",
    "@xcite plotted @xmath14  versus @xmath21 ; it is clear from fig .",
    "[ m51mt2 ] that the use of @xmath17  as a color does not degrade the luminosity sensitivity .",
    "our measurement errors for @xmath14  are 0.02 to 0.04 mag .",
    ", allowing us to discriminate easily between giants and all dwarfs except the most metal - poor using our photometric survey .    because we are searching for intrinsically very rare objects , we are particularly vulnerable to photometric errors  dwarfs with 3-sigma errors in their colors are more common than our most distant halo giants .",
    "since all but a few percent of the known halo stars have [ fe / h]@xmath221.0 , we can use metallicity as an additional criterion .",
    "we use an additional washington filter to identify halo giants : c. @xmath23is a metallicity indicator which was calibrated for giants by @xcite .",
    "we require that candidates lie in the [ fe / h ] @xmath24 region of the washington @xmath23  vs. @xmath17  diagram .",
    "figures [ m51mt2.4 m ] and [ cmmt2.4 m ] show how successful our photometric classification has been .",
    "photometric data from 22 high - latitude fields observed at the ctio 4 m with the btc in april 1999 are plotted with spectroscopic confirmations shown as larger symbols .",
    "these data will be described in more detail by @xcite .",
    "note that we deliberately chose to observe candidates near the giant / dwarf boundary to mark it carefully for future work .",
    "metal - poor halo dwarfs are of particular concern because their spectra more closely resemble metal - poor giants .",
    "the bahcall - soniera model @xcite predicts that 15 halo dwarfs will be found per square degree down to v=20 in the color range that we search for giants (= 0.9 to 1.2 ) .",
    "( recall from section 3.1 that we expect to see 4 - 5 halo giants in the same magnitude interval . )",
    "there are very few metal - poor k dwarfs with @xmath14  photometry available , so we can not accurately measure the photometric separation between metal - poor dwarfs and giants .",
    "however , @xcite have calculated synthetic @xmath14  colors for their grid of dwarf and giant models of different metallicity .",
    "these models are based on the linelists of @xcite .",

    "how common are these extremely metal - poor subdwarfs ?",
    "we can estimate the number of halo dwarfs with [ fe / h ] @xmath22 2.0 using the halo metallicity distribution of @xcite ; 31% of their sample has [ fe / h ] @xmath22 2.0 , which , in conjunction with the results of the bahcall / soniera model , translates to 4 very metal - poor halo dwarfs per deg@xmath1 for @xmath25 at the ngp .",
    "halo dwarfs only appear in significant numbers for @xmath0 , but the very distant halo giants also have @xmath0 . we need to consider these contaminants seriously .",
    "we have approached the problem of discriminating spectroscopically between halo giants and extreme k subdwarfs in two ways  by obtaining spectra of the few extremely metal - poor k dwarfs known in this temperature range , and supplementing these with synthetic spectra .",
    "it is practical to depend on follow - up spectroscopy to weed these objects out because of their rarity .",
    "since some of the major differences between k dwarfs and giants are due to molecular bands , we have used the nextgen model atmosphere grid @xcite for the synthetic spectra .",
    "these models were originally designed to model the atmospheres of very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs , and include a detailed molecular equation of state and a set of molecular opacity sources which improve on those used in previous work .",

    "while cn measurements of the three globular cluster giants shown in the figure are not available , field giant stars do show these cn features , as can be seen in figure 4(b ) of @xcite .",

    "the large pixels on the schmidt telescopes mean that we are more vulnerable to this problem there . with smaller pixels",
    "the galaxy contamination is much less severe  on our recent 4 m run ( reported in @xcite ) where fourteen halo giants were identified from ctio 4m / btc data , no galaxies were mistakenly found .      these stars will cover a distance range of 5  50 kpc , and thus represent another important tracer of the outer halo in our survey .",
    "the number of bhb stars per deg@xmath1   depends on the horizontal - branch morphology of the halo field , which is not well determined for large distances from the galaxy s center .",
    "if the halo field follows the globular clusters in having a redder horizontal branch morphology for large radii , then we would expect a few bhb stars per deg@xmath1  in the magnitude range @xmath11=1520 .",

    "we used the halo turnoff luminosity function calculated in section 4.1 and the preferred halo model from section 4 ( power law exponent of 3.0 and an axial ratio of 0.6 ) to calculate the numbers of turnoff stars per square degree we would expect to see in our fields . under these assumptions",

    "we choose stars with  color of 0.38 to 0.49 as halo turnoff star candidates .",
    "the transformation to @xmath17  color is complicated by the fact that we have no observations of metal - poor turnoff stars in this color .",
    "we approach the problem in two ways .",
    "first , only the most metal - poor stars will have a turnoff color as blue as  = 0.38 , so we could use the synthetic colors of @xcite for their models with [ fe / h ] = 2.0 to derive the transformation .",
    "this predicts a turnoff color of @xmath17=0.6 .",
    "second , we can derive the turnoff color using @xmath30  and stromgren photometry of metal - poor globular clusters from the literature .",
    "table [ turnoffcolors ] summarizes the turnoff colors in @xmath30  and @xmath18  of metal - poor globular clusters ngc 6397 , ngc 7099 and m92 , and the metal - rich cluster 47 tucanae .",
    "the average @xmath30  turnoff color for these three metal - poor clusters is 0.51 , which transforms via fig .",
    "[ mt2vi ] to @xmath17=0.64 .",
    "thus the estimates from theory and observation are in reasonable agreement , and we have chosen to use the observational estimate here .",
    "we also use the @xmath30  photometry of @xcite for 47 tuc to constrain the turnoff color of the thick disk to be @xmath17=0.81 . in summary , we take the color range from @xmath17  = 0.64 to 0.80 for our halo turnoff stars . as a consistency check on our photometry , we also require that @xmath23is in the range 0.2 to 0.5 .    thick disk stars scattering into the color range should be a minor problem because of our small photometric errors ( our @xmath17  errors are less than 0.02 mag . at v=19 ) and the fact that we work faint enough to be away from the regions of the galaxy where the thick disk dominates . using the models of turnoff stars in the thick disk and halo of section 3.1 , we can show that only for the brightest part of our magnitude range ( v=1617 , corresponding to distances of order 2.5 kpc , saturated on 4m / btc data but not on schmidt data ) are numbers of thick disk stars per square degree greater than halo star numbers in our fields , and then only by a factor of @xmath22 , which is not large enough to make significant numbers of thick disk stars `` leak '' into the halo color range via photometric errors . for stars with v=1718",
    ", numbers of thick disk and halo turnoff stars are approximately equal , and for fainter magnitudes , halo turnoff stars outnumber thick disk stars .",
    "the only other contaminants of our sample in this color range are small numbers of white dwarfs , qsos and rr lyraes .",
    "the qsos and white dwarfs are obvious from spectra , and the rr lyraes are sufficiently rare that few will be detected and some of these will be removed due to their variability on either photometric or spectroscopic observations",

    "with very few exceptions , all stars in this region of the cmd show spectra typical of halo stars , i.e. metal - poor .",
    "figure [ turnoffstars ] shows wiyn / hydra spectra of several of these stars .",
    "it is clear that the halo turnoff candidates are indeed metal - poor , confirming the accuracy of our photometry .",
    "@xcite identified an important group of halo turnoff stars with color bluer than  = 0.38 , and suggested that these stars were metal - poor stars with unusually young ages , which had originated in dwarf spheroidal satellites which were subsequently accreted into the galaxy s halo .",
    "another possibility is that these stars are the result of the evolution of multiple star systems of the halo .",
    "preston has obtained detailed follow - up spectroscopy of a number of these stars to test this possibility .",
    "@xcite estimated numbers in the solar neighborhood of 350450 per kpc@xmath31 ( cf . the density from table [ halolf ] of 2695 halo turnoff stars per kpc@xmath31 with @xmath10=4.5 ) .",
    "@xcite found from photographic starcount data that @xmath32% of halo stars were bluer than  = 0.4 , which is in rough agreement with the @xcite value .",
    "these bmp stars are particularly important for our survey if they have younger ages , and we select them by  color between 0.15 and 0.35 ( @xmath17  = 0.2 to 0.6 ) .    using the @xcite local normalization",

    "our fig [ cmd ] shows 23 such stars in the color range @xmath17  = 0.2 to 0.6 for an area of 2.75 deg@xmath1 , a little lower but not significantly different from the value of @xcite .",
    "accurate ccd photometry of large areas in many fields makes an new method of investigation of the halo possible . as discussed in section 3.3 ,",
    "the halo turnoff color is = 0.38 , and the thick disk turnoff is @xmath2 0.5 , so stars with colors between these two numbers are almost certainly halo stars close to the turnoff .",
    "photographic colors have such large errors ( 0.05 to 0.10 magnitudes ) that it is not possible to isolate halo turnoff stars from photographic data without simultaneously modelling the contribution of the thick disk .",
    "in contrast , our photometry is of such high and uniform quality that it is possible to separate halo turnoff stars cleanly from thick disk turnoff stars using the @xmath17color .",
    "[ turnoffs ] illustrates this in one of our lowest latitude fields , where both thick disk and halo turnoffs can be seen .",
    "we now make a preliminary analysis of the btc data to illustrate the power of our survey technique .",
    "our major aim here is to check whether our data agree with other models for the halo .",
    "the dataset obtained with the big throughput camera on the ctio 4 m in april 1999 @xcite is particularly useful for mapping the halo because of the uniform quality of the data , and the fact that conditions were photometric throughout the run .",
    "[ cartoon ] shows in cartoon form the location of the fields where data were obtained .",
    "there are 46 fields with latitudes ranging from + 25 to + 73 , and longitudes from @xmath33=17 through the galactic center to @xmath33=218 ( less than 40 degrees from the anticenter ) .",
    "we have checked for errors in reductions or reddening estimation by carefully examining the color - magnitude diagrams of all fields .",
    "figure [ turnoffs ] is typical : the position of the halo turnoff is clear , and agrees well with the calculated value of @xmath34=0.64 in all but two of the 46 fields . in these two fields",
    "it appears that the schlegel reddening values that we used should be adjusted by a few hundredths in order to bring the turnoff position to this color .",
    "because the stars are uniformly distributed across the color range from @xmath34=0.64 to 0.8 , photometric errors or reddening estimates of a few hundredths of a magnitude will in no case be strong enough to make the turnoff star numbers vary significantly .",
    "models of the shape of the halo have in many cases been derived from easily detectable tracers such as globular clusters @xcite or horizontal - branch stars @xcite .",
    "studies using star counts ( eg bahcall and soniera 1986 ) are handicapped by their inability to separate halo and thick disk accurately with photographic photometry , as discussed above",
    ". models from both globular clusters and field stars both find that the halo is centrally concentrated , with power - law exponent varying from 3.0 to 3.5 or even steeper .",
    "axial ratios vary from 0.5 to 1.0 , with suggestions from several groups that the axial ratio might change with galactocentric radius in the sense that the outer halo is spherical and the inner halo flattened .",
    "however , neither globular clusters nor horizontal - branch stars are ideal for measuring the density distribution of the halo . first",
    ", it is not clear that the halo field stars were formed under the same conditions as the globular clusters .",
    "second , possible age and metallicity gradients in the halo @xcite are reflected in horizontal - branch morphology .",
    "this can cause a different power - law exponent to be derived for rr lyraes and bhb stars , as found by @xcite .",
    "thus a check of the earlier results with a different tracer is valuable . although our turnoff star sample will also be sensitive to age and metallicity variations , we are able to check for such effects by examining the color - magnitude diagrams of discrepant fields directly .",
    "the estimation of the halo density in the solar neighborhood is even more challenging than the measurement of its density in more distant fields .",
    "it has in most cases been based on the local density of stars selected by their high proper motion ( eg bahcall and casertano 1986 ) , with kinematic corrections made for the amount of the halo that would be missed using this selection technique .",
    "there have also been a small number of direct measurements of local density of some tracer such as rr lyraes or red giants ( eg preston et al .",
    "1991 , morrison 1993 ) which agree within a factor of two with the proper - motion data , but different selection effects such as metallicity operate for these samples .",
    "attempts to extrapolate the results of pencil - beam surveys inward to the solar neighborhood are not always successful  @xcite and @xcite note the disagreement of a factor of two between the counts of nearby rr lyrae variables and the extrapolation of more distant rr lyrae counts inward .",
    "since we have few low - latitude fields and our btc data saturate for magnitudes much brighter than v=17 ( corresponding to a distance of 3 kpc for turnoff stars ) we have no direct constraints on the local density from our data .",
    "our preferred value of the solar neighborhood halo density will depend on the axial ratio adopted .",
    "we decided to re - examine the measurement of the local halo density from the proper - motion samples , as there have been significant advances in the information available on these stars since the work of @xcite .",
    "we have used the extended sample of @xcite , which has been updated recently to have a distance scale consistent with the hipparcos parallax measurements for subdwarfs , to make an estimate of the local density .",
    "bruce carney kindly made this sample available to us in advance of publication .",
    "also , in order to make comparisons with our btc data easier , we isolated stars in the turnoff star color bin we used (  between 0.38 and 0.5 , corresponding to @xmath17  between 0.64 and 0.8 ) , and then derived a local luminosity function for these stars alone .",
    "since this is a kinematically selected sample , we need to make corrections for the halo stars missed because of the proper motion selection .",
    "to minimise contamination of the sample by thick disk stars , which contribute strongly to the derived local density because the lowest velocity stars are given the highest weights ( see bahcall and casertano 1986 ) we only used stars with tangential velocity greater than 220 km / s , and rejected all stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath35 1.0 .",
    "this may reject a few genuine halo stars , but will cause an error of only @xmath210% in the derived density @xcite . erroneously including thick disk stars would have a much larger effect .",
    "the @xcite sample is drawn from the lowell proper motion catalog which covers the entire northern hemisphere and has a proper motion lower limit of 0.26 @xmath36 yr@xmath37 . in the color range of concern here ,",
    "the catalog s magnitude limit is sufficiently faint that all we need to do is correct for proper motion selection effects , which we do by weighting by @xmath38 , following @xcite .",
    "table [ halolf ] gives our results .",
    "carney and collaborators have a more complete kinematical analysis in progress , so we have chosen simply to use the simulations of @xcite to correct for the tangential velocity cut at 220 km / s .",
    "@xcite notes that the sample used by bahcall and casertano to derive halo kinematics was probably contaminated by thick disk stars , and calculates that the `` discovery fraction '' for a sample with this @xmath39 cutoff should be close to 0.5 , not 0.33 as they found .",
    "we have used this higher value in our calculations of the turnoff star luminosity function .",
    "while our maps of the halo based on accurate color - magnitude diagrams are less sensitive to possible variations in age and metallicity than the estimates from horizontal - branch stars in particular , they are less easy to interpret because of the difficulty of obtaining accurate distances to turnoff stars . turnoff stars in our chosen color range can have absolute magnitudes which vary from 3.5 to 5.5 , although the luminosity function of table [ halolf ] shows that many will have absolute magnitude near 4.5 .",
    "we have chosen to divide our data into three magnitude ranges ( v=1718.5 , 18.519.5 and 19.520.5 ) and to calculate model predictions for these magnitude ranges to compare directly with the star counts there .",
    "we plan to do a more statistically sophisticated analysis in a future paper  the values we derive here will be roughly correct for the distance ranges probed by the data , but not may not be optimal .    fig .",
    "[ axrat ] shows the sensitivity of our data to the axial ratio of the halo .",
    "it shows the ratio of number of stars in a given magnitude bin to the model predictions .",
    "both models have a power - law exponent of 3.0 , and one has an axial ratio b / a=1.0 ( spherical ) while the other has a moderate flattening ( b / a=0.6 ) .",
    "we have plotted these ratios vs a rough indicator of the z height travelled by each line of sight , calculated by assuming that all stars in the bin have absolute magnitude @xmath10=4.5 .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ axrat ] that the spherical halo provides a significantly worse fit .",
    "there is a trend with z : points with high z have fewer stars than the model predicts , and points with low z have more .",

    "the model predicts too few stars with large @xmath40 and too many with small @xmath40 .",
    "note also that in the panel showing residuals from the model with exponent 3.0 , the remaining residuals show no clear trend with @xmath40 .",
    "we adopt a model with b / a=0.6 and power - law exponent 3.0 for the rest of this analysis .",
    "only a 10% correction to the local halo density of table [ halolf ] is needed with these parameters .",
    "it is possible to examine the residuals to the model fits in more detail by plotting the position in the galaxy traversed by each field , and highlightling the fields with large residuals .",
    "figures [ residz ] and [ residr ] show a number of vertical and horizontal slices through the galaxy , for different ranges of y and z. fields with residuals more than 2.5@xmath41 from the model fit are highlighted .",
    "it can be seen that four of the fields with large negative residuals are towards the galactic center , and two , with large positive residuals , are in our lowest latitude field , which is close to the anticenter .",
    "interestingly , the discrepant fields cover a large range in both r and z , so a simple adjustment to the power - law exponent or flattening will not improve things .",
    "the variable axial ratio models of @xcite and @xcite will not solve the problem completely .",
    "the model of @xcite has an axial ratio changing linearly from b / a=0.5 at the galactic center to b / a=1.0 for ellipsoids with semi - major axis of 20 kpc .",
    "while the results in fields close to the minor axis which currently have large negative residuals may be improved by the adoption of a model where the axial ratio is closer to 1 at this point , the anticenter fields will become more discrepant since the axial ratio must become close to 1 at this distance from the center too .",
    "however , it is possible that the thick disk might be partially responsible for the excess of stars in this color range , if its scale height increases in the outer galaxy and/or it has a strong abundance gradient .",
    "we plan to investigate these issues further when we obtain more fields with low values of @xmath40 and z.",
    "we describe a survey designed to find field stars from the galactic halo in large enough numbers to provide a strong test of the question `` was the galactic halo accreted from satellite galaxies ? ''",
    "the survey will cover 100 deg@xmath1  at high galactic latitude .",
    "it uses an efficient pre - selection technique based on the washington photometric system to identify halo red giants , blue horizontal branch stars , blue metal - poor main sequence stars and turnoff stars .",

    ". our sample of halo stars will be unprecedentedly large , and cover galactocentric distances from the solar circle to more than 100 kpc .",
    "because the photometric selection has few and easily quantifiable selection effects , our sample will also enable thorough studies of the density distribution of the galactic halo , increasing the numbers of distant halo objects known by an order of magnitude .",
    "this will allow much more accurate measurement of the mass of the galaxy than previously possible .",
    "we discuss the particular problems caused for identification of the very distant halo giants by foreground k subdwarfs with very low metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath222.0 ) .",
    "these stars are roughly as numerous as the genuine halo giants for @xmath0 , and are not distinguishable from giants via the washington @xmath14filter that we use for photometric luminosity discrimination .",
    "however , with low - dispersion spectra of s / n 15 or more , a combination of several spectral features such as the ca i line at 4227    suffices to distinguish these stars reliably from giants .",
    "studies which use giants in the outer halo need to take particular care to eliminate these extreme k subdwarfs .",
    "we use one of our large photometric datasets , obtained in one run using the btc on the ctio 4 m , to constrain the spatial distribution of the galaxy s halo over ranges of galactocentric distances from approximately 520 kpc and z heights from 2 to 15 kpc by using halo turnoff star numbers .",
    "we find that a power - law with exponent 3.0 and a moderate flattening of b / a=0.6 gives a good fit to most of the data . however , there are a number of fields that show departures from this model , suggesting that we will need a more complex model in future as our coverage of fields in the halo increases .",

    "<S> we describe a major survey of the milky way halo designed to test for kinematic substructure caused by destruction of accreted satellites . </S>",
    "<S> we use the washington photometric system to identify halo stars efficiently for spectroscopic followup . </S>",
    "<S> tracers include halo giants ( detectable out to more than 100 kpc ) , blue horizontal branch stars , halo stars near the main sequence turnoff , and the `` blue metal - poor stars '' of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the success of our survey by showing spectra of stars we have identified in all these categories , including giants as distant as 75 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the problem of identifying the most distant halo giants . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , extremely metal - poor halo k dwarfs are present in approximately equal numbers to the distant giants for @xmath0 , and we show that our method will distinguish reliably between these two groups of metal - poor stars .    </S>",
    "<S> we plan to survey 100 square degrees at high galactic latitude , and expect to increase the numbers of known halo giants , bhb stars and turnoff stars by more than an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the strong test that this large sample will provide for the question `` was the milky way halo accreted from satellite galaxies ? '' , we will improve the accuracy of mass measurements of the milky way beyond 50 kpc via the kinematics of the many distant giants and bhb stars we will find .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that one of our first datasets constrains the halo density law over galactocentric radii of 520 kpc and z heights of 215 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the data support a flattened power - law halo with b / a of 0.6 and exponent 3.0 . </S>",
    "<S> more complex models with a varying axial ratio may be needed with a larger dataset . </S>"
