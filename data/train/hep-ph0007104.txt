    "the aim of this talk is to review some of the atomic precision measurements in atomic physics leading to precious informations in the realm of high - energy physics .",
    "the idea of atomic physics bringing light on the high - energy physics world requires some qualification due to the very different scales of energy involved in the two cases .",
    "in fact , typically one has a separation of about six or seven order of magnitude between the two scales and one expects the two physics being almost decoupled . in fact , if we look at some observable , @xmath0 , at a scale @xmath1 , we expect that the observable can be represented in the form @xmath2 in order to be able to derive informations about the physics at the scale @xmath3 , being at the scale @xmath4 , one starts considering a combination of observables corresponding to the corrections coming from the higher scale @xmath5 in order to measure @xmath6 one needs either the coefficient @xmath7 being very large in such a way to partially compensate the scale factor , or having an extremely good experimental sensitivity . in this talk",
    "i will consider two particular examples of situations where atomic physics can be relevant to high - energy physics , namely atomic violation of parity ( apv ) and possible violations of the discrete symmetry cpt , that is the product of charge - conjugation , parity and time - reversal .",
    "in fact , using heavy atoms like cesium in apv measurements one can get a good enhancement factor . on the other hand",
    ", cpt symmetry can be tested by using the extraordinary opportunities offered by the atomic traps in order to obtain a very accurate determination of frequencies .",
    "in this section i will discuss mainly the latest determination of the weak charge in atomic cesium and some of its implications in models of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the sm has been tested very precisely at machines such as lep and slc , where , working at an energy around the @xmath8 mass , one is mainly testing the property of the @xmath8 itself . therefore , the physics beyond the sm that can be looked for at these machines is the one giving corrections to the @xmath8-propagator and/or to the couplings of the @xmath8 with fermion - antifermion pairs .",
    "namely , new massive vector bosons , @xmath9 , which mix to the @xmath8 , or new particles running in loops and contributing to the @xmath8 self - energy or to vertex corrections . but consider , for instance , the case of a massive vector boson which does not mix to the @xmath8 , and therefore invisible at lep ( except for tiny radiative corrections ) . if the @xmath9 is coupled to fermions , in the low - energy limit it gives rise to an effective four - fermi interaction .",
    "therefore , low - energy experiments are complementary to the high - energy ones , and furthermore they are able to measure directly the couplings of the @xmath8 to light quarks ; something that at lep and slc can be done only in an indirect way . among the low - energy experiments a particular role is played by the apv experiments , due to the precision almost at the level of the one reached at lep / slc .",
    "let us now recall some feature of apv in atoms .",
    "first of all , within the sm the four - fermi parity violating hamiltonian density for nucleons is given by @xmath10\\ ] ] where c_ip=-2c_iu - c_id ,  c_in =- c_iu-2c_id ,  i=1,2and c_1q=-8a_ev_q=-(t_3^q-2s_^2q^q ) ,  c_2q=-8v_ea_q= -t_3^q(1 - 4s_^2 ) ,  q = u , dhere @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the vector and vector - axial couplings of the @xmath8 to the electrons and quarks .",
    "for a point - like nucleus with @xmath8 protons and @xmath15 neutrons , the hamiltonian density , in the non - relativistic limit , is given by _",
    "pv&=&where @xmath16 is the momentum of the electron , @xmath17 the total spin of the protons ( neutrons ) and @xmath18 the electron mass .",
    "i have also defined the",
    "_ weak charge _ of the atom asq_w(z , n)=2notice that for a heavy atom ( large values of @xmath8 ) the matrix element of the first term in @xmath19 is roughly proportional to @xmath20 , one factor coming from @xmath21 , one from the momentum of the electron and the third one from the wave function evaluated at the origin .",
    "this coherence effect was noticed by bouchiat and bouchiat @xcite and it provides , in the case of cesium ( @xmath22 ) an enhancement factor of about @xmath23 , more or less what is necessary in order to compensate for the decoupling factor from the scales mentioned in the introduction .    in order to get a rough idea of the bounds on new physics that can be obtained by a measurement of @xmath21 with a given sensitivity , we parametrize the new physics contribution to @xmath21 by a four - fermi effective interaction @xcite_np^pv= |e _ _ 5 e_q = u , dh_1q|q ^qif we assume @xmath24 , for a sensitivity @xmath25 one gets a bound ( 5 g_np )  tevif new physics is strongly interacting ( @xmath26 ) , then @xmath27 , whereas in the weakly interacting case ( @xmath28 ) we get @xmath29 . in any case",
    "we see that at 1% level of sensitivity , @xmath21 is able to test new physics for scales greater than 1 @xmath30 .    in apv measurements",
    "one looks at optical transitions between a pair of states @xmath31 mixed by @xmath19 and a state @xmath32 of the same nominal parity as @xmath33 .",
    "the mixing of the two eigenstates of parity is given by = where @xmath34 is the splitting between the two levels .",
    "if i denote by @xmath35 and @xmath36 the amplitudes for the two unperturbed transitions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the transition probability , after the mixing , is given by w = m_1 ^ 2+|e_1^pv|^22 im(e_1^pv)m_1the choice of the sign depends on the helicity of the photon which is emitted or absorbed in the transition . in the actual experiment on cesium",
    "one measures the _ circular dichroism _",
    ", that is the asymmetry for the absorption cross - section = 2 of course , the pv amplitude @xmath36 is proportional to the mixing parameter @xmath39 and therefore measuring @xmath40 one can get the matrix element of the pv hamiltonian .",
    "these ideas have been applied in particular to the transition @xmath41 in atomic cesium @xmath42 @xcite , but also to other atoms as thallium @xcite .",
    "the typical value of @xmath40 is @xmath43 , but there is a strong background which can be overcomed by letting the pv amplitude to interfere with a large electro - induced ( stark ) transition .",
    "eventually one extracts from the experiment the matrix element of @xmath44 which is proportional to @xmath21 times an atomic form factor @xmath45 which must be evaluated theoretically in order to extract the value of the weak charge .",
    "therefore the measurement must be coupled with theoretical calculations of similar accuracy in order to get a precise determination of @xmath21 . in the case of atomic cesium the calculation of @xmath45",
    "was performed independently by two groups @xcite .",
    "this calculation is not an easy task , as one has to use many - body perturbation theory coupled with hartree - fock techniques .",
    "the theoretical errors are quite difficult to estimate .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite did their estimate by looking at the differences between the theoretical and the experimental values of parity conserving quantities as dipole matrix elements and hyperfine splittings for the @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 states . in this way",
    "the error @xmath50 was obtained .",
    "after the new measurement of the weak charge of the cesium by the boulder group @xcite , which improved the accuracy of the previous experiment @xcite by more than a factor five , bennett and wieman @xcite re - examined the theoretical errors on @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , since the time of the previous estimate there have been a number of new and more precise measurements of the quantities of interest .",
    "the result is that now the agreement is much better than before , and as a consequence bennett and wieman got the estimate @xmath51 .",
    "it should be noticed that there is a third element which contributes to the extraction of @xmath21 from the data .",
    "this is the stark mixing - induced electric dipole moment amplitude , @xmath52 . the experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite were using a theoretical determination of @xmath52 .",
    "in @xcite the ratio @xmath53 has been measured .",
    "the off - diagonal magnetic dipole moment induced by the hyperfine interaction is well known empirically and it is possible to extract a precise value for @xmath52 . however , in a contribution to this conference @xcite , the matrix element @xmath54 has been accurately calculated with the result that the empirical formula for it should be corrected by a factor of 0.24% increasing the discrepancy with the sm ( see later ) .",
    "i would like also to comment about some possible neglected contribution in the evaluation of the atomic form factor .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that there could be a contribution arising from the difference of neutron and proton spatial distributions inside the nucleus .",
    "this contribution turns out to be very difficult to estimate , in fact it is quite model dependent .",
    "most probably it could introduce a further error on @xmath55 of about 0.3 . this would not change the conclusions in a very significant way .",
    "another point has been raised recently in ref .",
    "this author argues that the contribution from the breit interaction ( exchange of a transverse photon between two electrons ) could have been underestimated .",
    "the breit interaction contribution to the atomic form factor was estimated in @xcite and it was found to be very small . however in ref . @xcite it is found that the total effect , taking into account also second and third order contributions , is about twice the first order effect . as a consequence ,",
    "if `` all '' the higher order contributions could be shown to be negligible , the experimental measure would reconcile with the sm expectation for @xmath55 . however , see also ref .",
    "@xcite .    to conclude this analysis",
    "i think that an evaluation of the atomic form factor by taking into account the next order in the many - body perturbative theory is highly desirable in order to settle the question . in any case",
    "i find of some interest to that the theoretical error is indeed at the level of @xmath56 in order to see which are the possible implications of the apv in high - energy physics .",
    "i can start now to discuss the experimental results on @xmath55 .",
    "it is interesting to recall the value obtained in @xcite combined with the theoretical determination of @xmath45 @xcite q_w(cs)=-71.04(1.58)_exp(0.88)_ththe total error of these measurement on @xmath55 is at 2.5% level of accuracy that , at that time , was comparable with the sensitivity obtained at lep1 .",
    "in fact , this determination of @xmath55 lead to the first indication that technicolor models , in their most simple version obtained from scaling of qcd , could not possibly fit the data . the new experimental result on @xmath55 @xcite combined with the new determination of the theoretical error @xcite gives q_w(cs)^exp = -72.06(0.28)_exp(0.34)_th[qwexp]a result at 0.6% level of accuracy .",
    "on the theoretical side , @xmath21 can be expressed as @xcite q_w(cs)^th=-72.720.13 - 102_3^rad+_nq_w [ qw]including hadronic - loop uncertainty .",
    "i use here the variables @xmath57 ( i=1,2,3 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , which include the radiative corrections , in place of the set of variables @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 originally introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the above definition of @xmath61",
    "i have explicitly included only the standard model ( sm ) contribution to the radiative corrections . new physics ( that is physics beyond the sm ) contributions are represented by the term @xmath62 .",
    "also , i have neglected a correction proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "in fact , as well known @xcite , due to the particular values of the number of neutrons ( @xmath64 ) and protons ( @xmath22 ) in cesium , the dependence on @xmath65 almost cancels out .",
    "for a top mass of 175 @xmath66 and @xmath67 the value of @xmath68 is given by @xcite_3^rad=5.110(6.115)10 ^ -3for @xmath69 , corresponding roughly to the lower experimental bound from direct search at lep2 @xcite , one gets q_w(cs)^exp - q_w(cs)^sm=1.180.46 [ bounds]giving rise to a deviation of about @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , for increasing mass of the higgs the discrepancy increases . therefore ,",
    "if we assume as being correct the experimental result , the theoretical evaluation of @xmath45 and the evaluation of the theoretical errors , we are forced to conclude that the .",
    "we can draw another conclusion , that is , that in order to explain the data on @xmath55 we need new physics not constrained by the lep and slc data . in fact , as an example let me consider a type of new physics visible at lep as , for instance , contributing to the self - energy of the @xmath8 , the so called oblique corrections .",
    "in such a case one can write @xmath71 , and in order to compensate for the discrepancy on @xmath55 one needs _ 3n=(-11.64.5)10 ^ -3whereas from lep and slc data one can determine the sum _",
    "3^exp=_3^rad+_3n=(4.191)10 ^ -3therefore one gets @xmath72 , one order of magnitude too small to explain the data on @xmath55 .",
    "i would like also recall the experimental result of apv on thallium @xcite q_w(tl)^exp=-114.8(1.2 ) _",
    "exp(3.4)_ththis result is not as precise as the one on @xmath73 , and in fact the total error is about 3% . at this level",
    "it is perfectly compatible with the sm prediction q_w(tl)^sm=-116.70.1    a new experiment on cesium is being planned in paris but the experimental sensitivity is going to be lower than the one obtained in boulder .",
    "in berkeley and seattle there are plans for isotope ratio measurements . in this case",
    "the dependence on the atomic form factor would go away eliminating the theoretical error .",
    "however these ratios depend on the variation of the neutron density along the isotope chain .",
    "this would introduce errors at least twice as big as the experimental ones @xcite .",
    "we are now in the position of discussing the implications of eq .",
    "( [ bounds ] ) on new physics . assuming that the contribution of new physics , @xmath74 , is such to reproduce the experimental results",

    "however for the free case the dependence of the @xmath132 transition on the cpt and lorentz breaking parameters is suppressed by a factor @xmath135 , since the @xmath136 and @xmath137 levels shift by the same amount at the leading order in the breaking @xcite .",
    "consider now the spectroscopy of @xmath130 and @xmath131 in a magnetic field @xmath6 . in the basis",
    "@xmath138 the four @xmath136 and @xmath137 hyperfine zeeman levels are , for @xmath139 & & |b_n=|-1/2,-1/2 ,  |d_n=|1/2,1/2 + & & |a_n=_n|-1/2,1/2-_n |1/2,-1/2 + & & |c_n=_n|-1/2,1/2+_n|1/2,-1/2with @xmath140 .",
    "transitions of the type @xmath141 have leading - order sensitivity to lorentz and cpt violation , but they are field - dependent . as a consequence there is a problem connected with the broadening of the lines due to trapping field inhomogeneities .",
    "consider now hyperfine transitions in the ground state .",
    "again there is the problem of the zeeman broadening .",
    "however one can try to eliminate the frequency dependence on @xmath6 ( at lowest order ) by choosing a field independent transition point @xcite . for @xmath142 the state @xmath143",
    "is highly polarized ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "then the effect on the transition @xmath145 of the cpt and lorentz violating parameters is @xmath146 .",
    "therefore by putting @xmath147 the corresponding figure of merit can be defined as r_cd^h==4attaining a resolution of @xmath148 , one would get @xcite r_cd^h510 ^ -27",
    "in this talk i have reviewed some important consequences of atomic physics measurements in the domain of high - energy physics .",
    "in particular apv in cesium could be the first real indication of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the atomic physics tests of the cpt symmetry are already at a spectacular level of sensitivity , and the future experiments on @xmath130 and @xmath131 could give bounds well below the one expected from string theory .",
