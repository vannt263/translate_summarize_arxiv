    "we investigate from first - principles the thermal equation of state of body - centered cubic ( bcc ) tantalum , a group v transition metal , which is a useful high - pressure standard due to its high structural mechanical , thermal and chemical stability .",
    "ta has a very high melting temperature , 3269  k at ambient pressure , and its bcc structure is stable for a large pressure range .",
    "static diamond anvil cell experiments  @xcite up to 174  gpa and full - potential linearized muffin tin orbital ( lmto ) calculations  @xcite up to 1  tpa conclude bcc phase of ta is stable at these pressure range .",
    "similarly , shock compression experiments@xcite showed melting at around 300  gpa , but no solid - solid phase transition .",
    "firstly , we discuss the static high pressure properties of ta , which we obtained from first principles by using the lapw method weikrakauer , singh .",
    "the @xmath3,@xmath4,@xmath5 and @xmath6 states were treated as band states , others are described as core electrons .",
    "we used both the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite for the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "the monkhorst - pack special @xmath7-point scheme  @xcite with a 16x16x16 k - point mesh ( 140 k - points within the irreducible brillouin zone of the bcc lattice ) was used after convergence tests .",
    "the convergence parameter rk@xmath8 was 9.0 , and the muffin tin radii were 2.0 bohr , giving about 1800 plane - waves and 200 basis functions per atom at zero pressure .",
    "the total energy was computed for 20 different volumes from 62.5 to 164 bohr@xmath9 ( 1 bohr=0.529177 @xmath10 ) , and the energies were fit to the vinet equation  @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the zero pressure equilibrium energy and volume respectively , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the bulk modulus and @xmath17 .",
    "the subscript 0 alone throughout represents the standard state p=0 .",
    "all equations of state here are for an isotherm or static ( t=0 ) conditions , unless specified otherwise .",
    "pressures were obtained analytically from @xmath18 the calculated equation of state is compared with experiments  @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : eost0k ] .",
    "the lapw gga results are found to be more accurate than the lda .",
    "the discrepancies are larger beween theory and experiment at high pressures ; this may be due to strength effects in the experiments  @xcite , since we find good agreement with the experimental hugoniot to 400 gpa ( discussed below ) .",
    "for the pseudopotential mixed - basis calculations  @xcite ( mbpp , discussed below ) , we find that the lda agrees fairly well with the experiments , indicating compensating errors between the pseudopotential and the lda .",
    "since we are using a first - principles approach , and want to avoid ad hoc variations in procedure to get better agreement with experiments , we use the computational more accurate method with the least approximations , that is lapw and gga , rather than the mbpp with lda , in spite of the fortuitously better agreement of the latter with the room temperature data .",
    "the residuals between the calculated and fitted energies show large deviations for volumes less than 80  bohr@xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] ) .",
    "note that the residuals are all small and not evident for the large energy scale shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : globalf]a .",
    "other equation of state formulations , such as the extended birch equation @xcite show the same trend  @xcite .",
    "when the fit is restricted to volumes greater than 80  bohr@xmath19 , or extending the vinet equation by two more parameters related to the next two pressure derivative of bulk modulus , it is improved significantly .",
    "hence , these large residuals are related to different high- and low - pressure behavior of ta .",
    "the band structures and densities of states ( fig .",
    "[ fig : banddos ] ) show a major reconfiguration of the fermi surface .",
    "this electronic topological transition is the reason for this change in compression , and the behavior of the residuals for the fitted equations of state .",
    "this indicates that systematic deviations from simple equations of state can be used to find subtle phase transitions @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit interactions may be important for ta . in order to test this , we included spin - orbit coupling by second variational treatment  2variation including 20 - 80 bands .",
    "in contrast to the fully relativistic lmto results  @xcite , we found only negligible effect on the equation of state , so our computations were done without spin - orbit .",
    "in order to compute the high temperature properties of ta , we separated the helmholtz free energy as  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the static zero temperature energy , @xmath22 is the thermal free energy from electronic excitations , and @xmath23 is the vibrational contribution to the free energy . @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath22 were computed using the lapw method with the gga .",
    "@xmath23 was computed using the particle - in - a - cell ( pic ) model with a mixed basis pseudopotential method , as described below .",
    "the main differences we find between lda and gga are in the energy versus compression , but we find only small differences in energy versus atomic displacements .",
    "since lda converges much faster than gga , and is also faster per iteration cycle , we used lda for the large supercell computations required for the vibrational contributions .",
    "differences from using gga for this are negligible .",
    "the electronic part @xmath22 of the free energy is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the internal energy due to thermal electronic excitations , @xmath26 is the electronic entropy , and the fermi - dirac occupation @xmath27 is @xmath28 @xmath29 are the eigenvalues , @xmath30 is the chemical potential , and @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant . the vibrational free energy is given in terms of the partition function as @xmath32    the particle - in - a - cell model @xcite was used to calculate the partition function . in this model , the partition function is factored by neglecting atomic correlations .",
    "an atom is displaced in its wigner - seitz cell in the potential field of all the other atoms fixed at their equilibrium positions , i.e. the ideal , static lattice except for the wanderer atom .",
    "the partition function is simply a product of identical functions for all the atoms , involving an integral of boltzmann factor over the position of a single atom inside the wigner - seitz cell , @xmath33d\\vec{r}\\}^{n } ,   \\label{cellpart}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the de broglie wavelengths of atoms and @xmath35 is the potential energy of the system with the wanderer atom displaced by radius vector @xmath36 from its equilibrium position .",
    "the advantage of the cell model over lattice dynamics based on the quasiharmonic approximation is that anharmonic contributions from the potential - energy of the system have been included exactly without a perturbation expansion . on the other hand ,",
    "since the interatomic correlations between the motions of different atoms is ignored , it is only valid at temperatures above the debye temperature . diffusion and vacancy formation",
    "are also ignored , so premelting effects are not included .",
    "we have used the classical partition function , so quantum phonon effects are not included .",
    "thus the heat capacity and thermal expansivity do not vanish at low temperatures , for example .",
    "the present results are appropriate for temperatures above the debye temperature ( 245 k in ta @xcite ) and below premelting effects .",
    "since the debye temperature is below room temperature in ta , the classical thermal properties should be reasonable even down to room temperature .",
    "the electronic thermal free energy was obtained using the mermin theorem  @xcite ( eq .  [ mermin ] ) .",
    "the charge density is temperature dependent through both occupation numbers according to the fermi - dirac distribution and self - consistency .",
    "the electronic contributions to the thermal free energy were computed by the lapw method using the same computational parameters as the @xmath37 computations described in section  [ sec : static ] .    for the vibrational contributions ,",
    "it is necessary to do a large number of large supercell calculations , which is computationally intractable by the lapw method , but is achievable with the mbpp method  @xcite . in this mixed - basis approach , pseudo - atomic orbitals and a few low - energy plane waves",
    "are used as the basis set within a density functional , pseudopotential calculation .",
    "it was shown that the method offers a computationally efficient but accurate alternative .",
    "a semi - relativistic , nonlocal and norm - conserving troullier - martins  tromartins pseudopotential ( with associated pseudo - atomic orbitals ) was used to describe the ta atoms .",
    "the pseudopotential was generated from an @xmath38 atomic configuration with cutoff radii 1.46 , 2.6 and 3.4 bohr for @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath39 potentials , respectively , with non - linear core corrections .",
    "the cutoff radii were optimized by testing the transferability of the pseudopotential by considering the reasonable variations of the reference atomic configuration and by comparing the logarithmic derivative of the pseudo - wavefunctions with all - electron values in the valence energy range .",
    "the @xmath6 potential was chosen as the local component while @xmath5 and @xmath40 were kept as nonlocal while transforming the potential to the nonlocal separable kleinman - bylander form  @xcite .",
    "a full plane - wave representation is used for the charge density and potential , and a smaller cutoff is used for the basis set .",
    "the pseudoatomic orbitals are expanded in the large plane wave set for evaluation of the potential and charge density integrals in the hamiltonian and overlap matrices , and in the total energies . after checking the energy convergence , 550  ev and 60  ev",
    "were used for the large and small energy cutoffs , respectively , in the solid calculations .",
    "the exchange - correlation effects of electrons were treated within lda .",
    "the @xmath41 equation of state of bcc ta was computed to test the pseudopotential , and is compared with experiment and lapw results in fig .",
    "[ fig : eost0k ] .    for the pic computations , a supercell with 54 atoms was used .",
    "the mbpp calculations were carried out on this 54 atoms supercell using lda for exchange - correlations effects and 4 special @xmath7 points for bz integrations .",
    "the potential energy surface was then calculated as a function of the displacements of the wanderer atom .",
    "symmetry was taken into account in order to reduce the number of computations .",
    "the integrand in eq .",
    "[ cellpart ] has a gaussian - like shape and decays rapidly , and essentially is zero at half of the interatomic distances even at very high temperatures .",
    "therefore , integration over the wigner - seitz cell can be replaced by an integration over the inscribed sphere .",
    "also , the radial part of the integrand is invariant under point group operations of the lattice , hence a numerical quadrature can be used for angular integration based on the method of special directions  @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the radial integral is expanded in terms of lattice harmonics , cubic harmonics for a cubic lattice , then a quadrature rule is derived for the angular integration in terms of the radial integration by choosing special directions , @xmath42 , in such a way that the contribution from @xmath43 terms , as many lattice harmonics as possible , is zero . in all of the computations",
    ", we used one special direction which integrates exactly up to @xmath44 cubic harmonics  @xcite .",
    "then , the potential energy was calculated at 4 - 6 different displacements along this special direction . in order to model the potential ,",
    "these computed values were fit to an even polynomial up to order 8 , which shows the anharmonicity very clearly , since a second order fit describes the data poorly .",
    "finally , the cell - model partition was calculated from eq .",
    "cellpart by carrying out the integration numerically , and the vibrational free energy is simply given in terms of partition function by eq .",
    "we treated the resulting free energies @xcite three different ways .",
    "firstly , f - v isotherms were fit using the vinet equation of state , giving @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 as the parameters of the fit ( table [ table : vinet ] , fig .",
    "fig : vinetvke ) . because of the thermal expansivity , the minimum energy shifts to higher volumes with increasing temperature , and above t=6000  k the p=0 volume is not in the range of volumes we studied .",
    "the experimental p=0 melting temperature is 3270 k , so temperatures above this are non - physical in any case .",
    "the parameters for higher temperatures are fictive parameters that describe the higher pressure equation of state accurately .",
    "the vinet parameters could be fit to polynomials versus temperature to obtain a thermal equation of state , but the following approaches require fewer parameters .",
    "a second thermal equation of state was obtained by analyzing the thermal pressure obtained from the vinet fits ( i.e.  the differences in pressures between isotherms ) .",
    "the thermal pressure as a function of volume and temperature is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pthermal ] .",
    "the volume dependence of the thermal pressure for ta is very weak up to 80% compression .",
    "deviations at higher compressions may be due to the fit through the electronic topological transition discussed above , and thus due to inflexibility in the vinet equation , rather than a real rise in thermal pressure .",
    "the thermal pressure is also quite linear in t. the thermal pressure changes are given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 is quite constant for many materials @xcite in the classical regime ( above the debye temperature ) .",
    "hence , a greatly simplified thermal equation of state is to add a thermal pressure @xmath51 to the static pressure @xmath52 .",
    "since our equation of state is classical , we can use this expression at all temperatures .",
    "this simple equation of state gives @xmath53 and @xmath54 which therefore are good approximations over this pressure and temperature range for ta .",
    "the thermal pressure was averaged over volumes from 60 bohr@xmath19 to 220 bohr@xmath55 , and is shown as a function of temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig : pavth ] .",
    "the solid line has a slope @xmath56 of 0.00442 gpa / k .",
    "this is close to @xmath57 , which is 0.00460 gpa / k at 1000 k and zero pressure .",
    "so a simple equation of state for ta is the static pressure given by v@xmath58(t=0)=123.632 bohr@xmath19 , k@xmath58(t=0)=190.95 gpa , and k@xmath59(t=0)=3.98 in the vinet equation ( eq .  [ vinetpv ] ) plus the thermal pressure p@xmath60 .",
    "thirdly , an accurate high temperature global equation of state was formed from the @xmath41 vinet isotherm and a volume dependent thermal free energy @xmath61 as : @xmath62 this is the thermal helmholtz free energy per atom , which must be added to equation [ vinetev ] to obtain the total free energy .",
    "the parameters @xmath63 are given in si units in table table : params , which gives the free energy in joules / atom ; t is in kelvin and v in m@xmath19/atom .",
    "the term in @xmath64 is necessary to give the proper classical behavior at low temperatures , since we are evaluating the classical partition function , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 at @xmath37 . for the best overall accuracy ,",
    "the t=0 isotherm was also included in the global fit .",
    "the global fit is compared with the computed free energies in fig .",
    "fig : globalf .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "deviation of the fit is 0.4 mry . at low temperatures ( 0 and 1000 k ) the residuals ( fig .",
    "fig : globalfb ) are larger due to the electronic topological transition discussed above ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] ) , but at higher temperatures this anomaly is less pronounced due to the thermal smearing , and the equation of state fits well .    thermal equation of state parameters such as @xmath67,@xmath1,@xmath0,@xmath68,@xmath69 , and the heat capacity @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be obtained from the global fit by differentiation and algebraic manipulation ( see @xcite for a collection of useful formulas . ) we now discuss the behavior of these parameters .",
    "the thermal expansion coefficient is presented , and compared with zero pressure experiments @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .",
    "the deviations at lower temperatures are due to the use of the classical partition function .",
    "the thermal expansivity is a quite sensitive parameter , and the errors at moderate temperatures , which are typical in first - principles computations , may come from a number of sources ( error in the p=0 volume , lda , the pseudopotential , the pic model , or convergence in k - points or basis set ) .",
    "the divergence in behavior at higher temperatures is not due to vacancy formation , since the vacancy formation in ta is high ( 3.2 ev ) @xcite , and the fraction of vacancies at the melting point is less than 10@xmath72 .",
    "the temperature range over which the anomaly occurs seems too large to be a premelting effect .",
    "one possible explanation would be an incipient solid - solid phase transition in ta , which would not be detected in the pic method .",
    "the upturn in @xmath1 with increasing temperature is apparently a low pressure phenomenon .",
    "it is possible that it is due to an experimental problem , such as oxidation of the sample .",
    "the thermal expansivity drops rapidly with increasing pressure ( fig .",
    "fig : alpha ) , and this is parametrized by the anderson - grneisen parameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deltat ] ) @xmath73 the behavior of @xmath2 is complex . at low pressures it increases with increasing temperature , but at elevated pressures",
    "it decreases with temperature .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 can be fit to a form  @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "the average @xmath2 ( averaged from 0 - 6000 k ) decreases with compression , and a power law fit gives @xmath76 ; at 1000 k @xmath77 .",
    "interestingly these values are not that different from mgo  @xcite ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the behavior is much different than for fe , where @xmath2 is constant to 150 gpa with values of 5.2 and 5.0 for fcc and hcp , respectively , after which it drops more slowly than a power law @xcite .",
    "the difference between @xmath2 and @xmath80 is an important anharmonic parameter , and is related to the change in the bulk modulus with temperature at constant volume and the thermal pressure with compression at constant temperature : @xmath81 fig .",
    "[ fig : deltat]d shows that @xmath82 is quite small over a large temperature and compression range , but increases at high t and p. this is consistent with the accuracy of the simple equation of state ( eq .  [ eq : simpleeos ] ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath82 is also surprisingly similar to the behavior of mgo ( see fig .  3.3 in ) .",
    "changes in thermal pressure @xmath83 are given by @xmath84 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : akt ] . changes in @xmath50 are small , but it is interesting that the sign of the change with temperature is strongly dependent on pressure , indicating that experiments to determine @xmath85 at low pressures may not be applicable to a very large pressure range .",
    "a most important parameter , particularly for reduction of shock data , is the grneisen parameter @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the internal energy .",
    "the grneisen parameter is used in the mie - grneisen equation of state , which assumes @xmath0 independent of temperature .",
    "then the thermal pressure on the hugoniot , for example is given by the change in internal energy by @xmath88 fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] shows that at elevated pressures , @xmath0 is moderately temperature dependent , and it varies more strongly with temperature below 100 gpa .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 with pressure is given by @xmath89 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 is not constant , as is often assumed , but decreases significantly with pressure and temperature .",
    "if @xmath50 and @xmath70 were constant , eq .",
    "[ eq : gamma ] shows that @xmath90 .",
    "[ fig : akt ] shows that @xmath50 is quite constant , so that large changes in @xmath69 must be due primarily to changes in the heat capacity @xmath70 .",
    "[ fig : heatcapacity ] shows indeed that the heat capacity is a strong function of temperature and pressure .",
    "this is due mainly to the electronic contributions .",
    "the experimental c@xmath91 at zero pressure  @xcite is also shown .",
    "other than the large differences from experiment at very low temperatures , due to neglect of quantum phonon effects in the present model , there is a large increase in the experimental heat capacity with increasing temperature that is not seen in the pic results .",
    "a similar large increase in the experimental thermal expansivity is not predicted by the model ( fig .  [",
    "fig : alpha ] ) .",
    "vacancy formation ( not included in the pic model ) seems an unlikely source for this discrepancy as discussed above .",
    "an incipient phase transition or sample oxidation seems the most likely cause of the observed behavior in the thermal expansivity and the heat capacity .    to compare with experiment at high pressures and temperatures",
    ", we consider the high temperature , high pressure equation of state obtained by shock compression @xcite .",
    "the pressures , @xmath92 and temperatures , @xmath93 , on the hugoniot of ta are given by the rankine - hugoniot equation : @xmath94 we solved the rankine - hugoniot equation using our equation of state results by varying the temperature at a given volume until it is satisfied .",
    "the calculated hugoniot shows very good agreement with experimental data as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hug ] .",
    "computations of the hugoniot using a modified free - volume method were recently presented by wang _",
    "et al . _",
    "though superficially similar to the pic method , their model is approximate .",
    "they included the electronic free energy in the same way that we do , but no supercell is used for the phonon contribution .",
    "instead they find an effective potential from the equation of state of the primitive , one atom unit cell , and integrate the mean field phonon partition function based on this effective potential .",
    "this is a tremendous reduction in effort compared with the use of large supercells and finding the potential for displacing one atom in the supercell .",
    "they obtain impressive results for this simple model obtaining excellent agreement with the experimental hugoniots , not only for ta , but also al , cu , mo and w. nevertheless , it seems unlikely that this simply model will work for lower symmetry systems such as hcp - fe @xcite or for elastic constants .",
    "for example , the c / a varies with temperature in hcp - fe , but the wang _ et al .",
    "_ model would not allow for this .",
    "we summarize the zero pressure 300k equation of state parameters in table [ table : p0params ] .",
    "the equation of state gives @xmath95(0,t=300 k)=124.489 bohr@xmath19 , 2% higher than the experimental value .",
    "another way of looking at the discrepancy , is that the computed pressure at the room temperature experimental volume 121.8 bohr@xmath19 is 4.1 gpa rather than 0 .",
    "table [ table : p0params ] also shows the equation of state parameters computed at the experimental volume .",
    "the main discrepancy is the thermal expansivity which is 35% too high , though this is reduced by comparing at the experimental volume . the gruneisen parameter is similarly high .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is unknown , as discussed above , although the thermal expansivity ( and thus @xmath0 ) are known to be very sensitive . apparently this inaccuracy must decrease with increasing pressure , since our hugoniot agrees well with experiment , up to temperatures of almost 10,000k .",
    "perhaps our potential surface is not modeled accurately enough at small displacements and low pressures due to the very small energy differences involved in that regime .",
    "we have studied the static and thermal equation of state of ta from first principles calculations .",
    "an electronic topological phase transition is found around 200  gpa .",
    "three different forms of thermal equation of state is provided as : vinet equation of state with temperature dependent equilibrium quantities , simple linear temperature dependent average thermal pressure , and a global fit to the helmholtz free energy f(v , t ) .",
    "the simple equation of state @xmath96 works quite well , but more accuracy and insites into higher order thermoelastic parameters were obtained from the global fit in @xmath95 and @xmath97 .",
    "we find that @xmath50 is quite constant , as has been seen in experiments for a wide range of materials above the debye temperatures @xcite and has been shown for simple pair potentials @xcite .",
    "electronic excitations contribute significantly to the heat capacity temperature dependence of @xmath70 , and thus to variations in the grneisen parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we find good agreement with the experimental hugoniot and thermal expansivity , though the rapid increase in the thermal expansivity and heat capacity at high temperatures remains unexplained .",
