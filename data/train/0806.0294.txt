    "the advent of the large scale sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , the 2-micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al . 2006 ) and deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ; epchtein et al .",
    "1997 ) were the main factors that led to the identification and study of the two spectral classes beyond m ; the l dwarfs ( with effective temperature @xmath92300 - 1450k ; golimowski et al .",
    "2004 ) have dusty atmospheres and very red near infrared colours , while the even cooler t dwarfs ( @xmath101450k ) have clear atmospheres ( from which the dust has settled ) , and their blue infrared spectra are dominated by strong ch@xmath11 and h@xmath12o absorption bands .",
    "the spectral typing scheme of kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1999 ) established the first properly classified l dwarf population via 2mass discoveries .",
    "the first t dwarf was discovered as a close companion to the early m dwarf gl229 ( nakajima et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the first l dwarf as a companion to the white dwarf gd 165 ( becklin & zuckerman 1988 ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "however , the subsequent growth of the known t ( and l ) dwarf populations ( @xmath13500 l dwarfs and @xmath13100 t dwarfs are known at time of writing ; kirkpatrick 2005 ) has been predominantly achieved via searches of the sdss ( e.g. leggett et al .",
    "2000 ; geballe et al . 2002 ; knapp et al . 2004 ; chiu et al . 2006 ) and 2mass ( e.g. kirkpatrick et al . 2000 ; cruz et al . 2007 ; burgasser et al . 2002 ; 2004 ; tinney et al .",
    "2005 ; looper kirkpatrick & burgasser 2007 ) databases .",
    "the coolest @xmath14 probed by sdss and 2mass are currently defined by the eight t7.5 - 8 dwarfs ( as typed by the burgasser et al .",
    "( 2006b ; b06 ) scheme ) discovered in these surveys .",
    "these objects have @xmath14 in the range 725 - 950k ( geballe",
    "et al . 2001 ; saumon et al . 2006 ; 2007 ; leggett et al . 2007 ;",
    "burgasser , burrows & kirkpatrick 2006 ) . at lower @xmath14 it is possible that a new spectral class ( pre - emptively called y , following kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ) may be necessary , if for example , spectral changes occur such as the strengthening of ammonia absorption , and/or the condensation of atmospheric water clouds ( burrows , sudarsky & lunine ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "l and t dwarfs already encompass the temperature scale of transiting `` hot jupiters '' ( e.g. knutson et al . 2007 ) , and populating the even cooler @xmath14 regime will allow us to study and understand atmospheres whose @xmath14 is similar to cooler extra - solar giant planets populations .",
    "the current complement of known l and t dwarfs allows some constraints to be placed on the substellar mass function ( e.g. chabrier 2003 and references therein ; allen et al .",
    "2005 ; metchev et al . 2007 ) .",
    "however , if the brown dwarf mass function is to be accurately constrained , a significantly larger number of late t dwarfs will be extremely beneficial , since the @xmath14 distribution of t dwarfs in the @xmath15950k range is particularly sensitive to mass function variations ( e.g. fig 5 of burgasser 2004 ) . also , accurate constraints on the brown dwarf birth rate ( i.e. their formation history ) need the improved statistics that come with larger numbers of both l and t dwarfs .    the ukirt ( uk infrared telescope ) infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; lawrence et al .",
    "2007 ) is a new infrared survey being conducted with the ukirt wide field camera ( wfcam ; casali et al .",
    "ukidss is a set of five sub - surveys , with three wide field surveys  the large area survey ( las ) , the galactic cluster survey ( gcs ) and the galactic plane survey ( gps )  and two very deep surveys  the deep extra - galactic survey ( dxs ) and the ultra - deep survey ( uds ) .",
    "the las is the largest of the wide - field surveys , and will cover 4000 sq degs of sky in four filter bands , going several magnitudes deeper than 2mass .",
    "ukidss began in may 2005 , and at the time of writing there have been four eso ( european southern observatory)-wide releases , including an early data release ( edr ) in february 2006 ( dye et al .",
    "2006 ) , and three subsequent main data releases : data release 1 ( dr1 ) in 2006 july covering 190 sq degs ( warren et al .",
    "2007b ) , data release 2 ( dr2 ) in 2007 march covering 280 sq degs ( including dr1 ; warren et al .",
    "2007c ) , and data release 3 ( dr3 ) in 2007 december , covering 900 sq degs ( including dr1 and dr2 ) .",
    "these data are providing un - paralleled sensitivity to l and t dwarf populations , and our collaboration has begun a variety of ukidss - based searches for these objects . here",
    "we focus on our search for late t dwarfs and potentially new record breaking low-@xmath14 objects .",

    "section 3 describes the follow - up photometry we have obtained to identify spurious objects amongst these candidates , and section 4 presents our spectroscopic follow - up and confirmation of the 15 new t dwarfs .",
    "section 5 discusses the spectral morphology and colour of the new t dwarfs and how these could relate to their physical properties , and section 6 presents updated constraints on the size of the las t dwarf population , compared to theoretical predictions .",
    "section 7 discusses some future work and gives our conclusions .",
    "in this section we describe our photometric search for t dwarfs and cooler 700400k objects ( potential y dwarfs ) .",
    "we will focus this description on our searches of dr1 and dr2 , since our follow - up of candidates from these data releases has a reasonably well constrained level of completion , and issues such as contamination amongst the candidates will be addressed more usefully . however , the process of t dwarf identification is ongoing with dr3 , using these same techniques .",
    "note also that some dr1 results have previously been published ( kendall et al .",
    "2007 ; lodieu et al . 2007 ; warren et al . 2007 ) , but for clarity we here describe our search of dr1 and dr2 as a whole .",
    "we base our search on the current knowledge of @xmath16 properties of known objects previously discovered in 2mass and sdss , as well as on colour trends suggested by the latest theoretical atmosphere models for @xmath14 ranges below those that are well probed by previous surveys .",
    "we also make use of las magnitudes measured using the new @xmath17 filter ( 0.971.07@xmath18 m ) , which was specifically designed and installed in wfcam to ease the selection and separation of high - redshift quasars and cool brown dwarfs ( warren & hewett 2002 ) .",
    "2mass t dwarfs have neutral to blue near infrared colours with decreasing @xmath14 ( burgasser et al .",
    "2002 ) , and a fairly uniform @xmath191 ( from synthesized colours ; hewett et al .",
    "late t dwarfs are clearly well separated from redder l dwarfs by their @xmath2 colour ( although there is some @xmath2 colour overlap for early t dwarfs ) , and from earlier objects by , in general , both @xmath2 and @xmath1 colour ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the model predictions suggest that the near infrared colours will remain blue ( @xmath20 ) for 400 - 700k .",
    "however , while the models uniformly predict that the 400 - 700k dwarf colour sequence should form an extension of the known t dwarfs , they differ somewhat on their predicted @xmath1 colour trends . the cloud - free cond models ( allard et al .",
    "2001 ; baraffe et al .",
    "2003 ) , the more recent settl models ( allard et al . , in preparation ) and the marley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) models all suggest a blue @xmath1 colour trend , while the burrows et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and tsuji , nakajima & yanagisawa ( 2004 ) models suggest a red @xmath1 colour trend for this @xmath14 regime .",
    "in addition , known t dwarfs from sdss have very red ( @xmath212.2 ) optical colours , and extremely red optical - to - infrared colours ( @xmath222.5 ; note that here and hereafter @xmath23 and @xmath24 are ab magnitudes whereas @xmath25 is on the vega system ) , the latter being a particularly good indicator of @xmath14 for early - mid t dwarfs ( knapp et al .",
    "the model predictions suggest that these extreme optical and optical - to - infrared colours should continue to be strong indicators of low-@xmath14 in the 400 - 700k regime .",
    "a combination of @xmath26 photometry from the las and deep optical constraints from sdss thus offer an extremely powerful tool to identify samples of mid - late t dwarfs and even cooler objects to photometric depths several magnitudes deeper than previous wide - field surveys .      our search methodology was to mine ( via the wfcam science archive",
    "; hambly et al .",
    "2007 ) the las for objects with @xmath26 photometry consistent with known t dwarfs or with the expected colours of 400 - 700k objects using the models as a guide , and then cross - match with sdss ( where possible ) to obtain optical - to - infrared constraints .",
    "here we describe three sets of search criteria that probe to different depths in dr1 and dr2 , requiring coverage in all four @xmath26 bands , but relying on source detection in different numbers of bands .",
    "our first search method required @xmath26 detection with @xmath270.8 and @xmath280.4 ( to separate t dwarfs from l dwarfs ) .",
    "this method is limited by the @xmath29band for mid - late t dwarfs , does not probe the full range of @xmath1 colour for potential 400 - 700k objects , and is thus better at finding brighter early t dwarfs which can have redder @xmath30 colour .",
    "we also cross - matched objects with sdss , requiring a detection with @xmath212.2 and @xmath222.5 .",
    "while we also performed searches requiring optical non - detection , we postpone analysis of these candidates to a future publication , and here present the one new object identified with a sdss detection ; ulas j115759.04 + 092200.7 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "our second search method required @xmath31 las detection and a @xmath32 non - detection , and probed the colour space shown in figure 1 , including objects with @xmath280.1 and @xmath270.5 .",
    "this search is @xmath33-band limited for objects with blue @xmath2 , but fully probes the range of 400 - 700k colour space suggested by the models .",
    "candidates were cross - matched with sdss and rejected if found to be optical detections with either @xmath342.2 or @xmath352.5 , or found to have no sdss coverage .",
    "this search produced a sample of 33 candidates .",
    "our third search method required @xmath36 las detection and @xmath37 non - detection , with @xmath270.5 . for objects with blue @xmath2",
    "this search is @xmath25-band or @xmath17-band limited for @xmath380.8 and @xmath270.8 respectively , and probes to a greater depth than method 2 .",
    "sdss cross - matching constraints were imposed as before , and resulted in a sample of 45 candidates .",
    "in addition we used our second search method to search the las sky outside the sdss dr6 footprint , substituting our sdss optical constraints for shallower schmidt plate @xmath39-band coverage from the supercosmos sky survey .",

    "the bt - settl models also suggest that the @xmath17-band peak has some @xmath14 sensitivity , with increasing and decreasing @xmath14 suppressing and enhancing the @xmath17-band flux ( with respect to the @xmath41band peak ) respectively . by comparison",
    "the tucson models also exhibit some @xmath17-band variation with @xmath14 , but in the opposite sense to that of the bt - settl models , and the ames models show little variation with @xmath14 ( leggett et al .",

    "in addition , the bt - settl @xmath17-band flux is suppressed to some extent at lower gravity . however ,",
    "this effect is not predicted by the tucson or ames models ( with both models showing an increase in flux for lower gravity ) , and this trend is thus ambiguous when taking all models into consideration .",
    "metallicity affects the @xmath32-band peak in a similar way to gravity , where increasing and decreasing metallicity causes @xmath32-band enhancement and suppression respectively .",
    "indeed , @xmath32-band fluxes may be quite sensitive to even small metallicity differences , as suggested by liu , leggett & chiu ( 2007 ) when comparing the spectra of hd 3651b ( burgasser 2007 ) and gl570d .",

    "optical constraints ( e.g. non - detections ) would be particularly important as the near infrared colours of candidates become more akin to those of hot stars , but the capabilities of ukidss and sdss combine to give great potential for such searches .",

    "allowing for the two outstanding candidates we place a constraint of 1921 t4-t8.5 dwarfs with measured @xmath280.1 and @xmath619 in the las dr2 sky , and allow for a additional 10% poisson uncertainty on the upper limit to account for the limited statistical accuracy of our sdss sample analysis .    to account for measurement uncertainties ,",
    "we have estimated the number of @xmath5t4 dwarfs with intrinsic @xmath280.1 whose colour may have been statistically scattered out of the selection region . to do this we estimated ( for each @xmath5t4 dwarf discovered via @xmath31 detection ) the probability that @xmath2 colours could have been scattered sufficiently red - ward from the las measured value , taking into account the 1-@xmath70 uncertainties on their measured colour .",
    "probabilities were then summed , and our result suggests that we would only expect @xmath01.5 @xmath5t4 dwarfs to be missed in this way .",
    "in addition , we account for some level of unresolved binarity amongst the las t dwarfs .",
    "unresolved binaries will be brighter than a single t dwarf population , and could thus be found in a larger volume of sky .",
    "a correction is necessary if one wishes to compare t dwarf numbers with theoretical predictions for the total number of individual t dwarfs .",
    "brown dwarf binaries are generally tight systems ( e.g. @xmath1515au ; reid et al .",
    "2006 ) , of approximately near equal mass components . a volume limited sub - stellar binary fraction ( bf ) has been reported with values ranging from 1050 per cent via open cluster photometry and high resolution imaging ( e.g. burgasser et al .",
    "2003 ; pinfield et al .",
    "2003 ; lodieu et al .",
    "2007 ) , where    @xmath128    @xmath129 and @xmath130 being the number of binary and single systems respectively .",
    "if one makes the simplifying assumption of binary components of equal brightness ( see burgasser et al .",
    "2003 for a more generalised conversion for a range of mass - ratio distributions ; e.g. allen 2007 ) , then the relative number of binary and single systems in a magnitude limited sample will be    @xmath131    and the number of binary systems ( compared to the total magnitude limited number of systems @xmath132 ) will be    @xmath133    for bf=1050% , we thus estimate that 2474 per cent of the sources in our magnitude limited sample could be unresolved binaries . of these unresolved binaries systems , only @xmath035 per cent ( @xmath134100% )",
    "would be included in our @xmath619 sample if the binary components were resolvable ( i.e. if the combined binary @xmath25-band brightness is @xmath1318.25 then the individual t dwarf components would have @xmath6819 and would be excluded from our sample ) .",
    "however , for the @xmath618.25 unresolved binary systems , we must count both of the t dwarf components .",
    "we thus derive a binarity correction factor of 0.760.93 ( for bf=1050 per cent respectively ) to correct our numbers to represent a magnitude limited sample of individual t dwarfs .",
    "note that despite a wide range in bf , this binary correction factor has a relatively small range .",
    "we also account for spatial incompleteness which can result from the way in which optical catalogues are used to inform candidate selection . in our initial selection",
    ", a nearby optical source might result in a candidate being rejected if it was close enough to mascarade as an optical counterpart , making the candidate appear too bluer in its optical - infrared colour .",
    "this effectively decreases the search area by some fraction that is dependent on the source density and the search criteria used .",
    "we account for this with a correction factor ( @xmath135 ) that is the ratio of clear sky ( unaffected by optical mis - matches ) to total sky considered ( @xmath136 ) , and can be derived from probability analysis as ,    @xmath137    where @xmath70 is the area excluded by a single optical source and @xmath138 is the number of optical sources in the area considered . for 1 deg@xmath139",
    "this reduces to @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the number density of optical sources .",
    "figure 7 shows @xmath135 plotted against source density for our search of the las ( solid line ) as well as for previous searches of 2mass ( dashed line , e.g. burgasser et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the differences result from the different exclusion regions used , which extended out to 10 arcsecs from any usno - a2.0 optical source for 2mass searches , but only extend out to 2 arcsecs from any sdss source for our search of the las .",
    "the full effect of this incompleteness depends on the number density of optical sources in the regions of sky being considered , and this in turn is dependent on the galactic latitude .",
    "las dr2 extends across the @xmath14220 - 80 deg range , although is mostly concentrated in @xmath14240 - 75 deg .",
    "the sdss source number density ranges from @xmath020,000 - 40,000 sources per square degree over the las dr2 sky ( indicated by open diamonds in figure 7 ) , and as can be seen , this results in a range of @xmath135=0.96 - 0.98 .     for excluding regions around optical sources as a function of source density .",
    "the ukidss las exclusion regions comprise 2 arcsec radii circles centred on sdss sources , and for comparison the 2mass exclusion regions comprise 10 arcsec radii circles centred on usno sources .",
    "the source densities inherent in our search and in previous 2mass searches out of the plane are enclosed by open diamonds.,width=302 ]    for the 2mass comparison , despite the optical surveys being shallower than sdss , the larger exclusion regions ( with 10 arcsec radii ) combined with the greater range of galactic latitude searched ( reaching @xmath143 ) result in the @xmath135 correction having a potentially much greater impact than it does for the las dr2 t dwarf sample .",
    "we chose to factor in a 3% increase to our t dwarf numbers to account for this spatial incompleteness effect , but note that this small correction has no significant effect on our results .",
    "finally , we account for malmquist bias .",
    "we first consider the effect of an intrinsic scatter in the m@xmath144 of t dwarfs ( classical malmquist bias ) .",
    "this scatter will cause the @xmath25-band magnitude limited sample to probe different volumes for any fixed spectral type .",
    "those t dwarfs that are intrinsically brighter than average ( for their type ) will be sampled from a larger volume than those that are fainter .",
    "this will bias the mean m@xmath144 to brighter values , and effectively result in the overall sample coming from a larger volume than if the t dwarfs had a non scattered m@xmath144-spectral type relation . assuming a uniform space density and ignoring any effects of slope in the substellar luminosity function ( i.e. @xmath145 ) , the fractional increase in the measured number of t dwarfs ( @xmath146 ) is given by    @xmath147    where @xmath70 is the rms dispersion ( assuming a gaussian distribution ) of t dwarf absolute magnitudes .",
    "we estimated this scatter using the sample of t dwarfs with parallax measurements presented by liu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) combined with their polynomial fit ( m@xmath144-spectral type ) to the single t dwarfs ( ignoring known and possible unresolved binaries ) .",
    "when one considers only the subset of t dwarfs with spectral type @xmath5t4 ( i.e. matched to the dr2 sample ) , the rms scatter from the best - fit polynomial is @xmath70=0.29 , resulting in an increased volume of @xmath148=16% .",
    "we thus decreased our t dwarf numbers to account for this bias .",
    "an additional malmquist effect results from photometric uncertainty near the sample limit , since more t dwarfs scatter into the sample from fainter magnitude ( i.e. at a greater distance , in a larger volume ) than scatter out of it .",
    "however , since we measured accurate follow - up photometry for the majority of our initial candidates ( down to @xmath25=19.5 ) before we imposed the @xmath25=19.0 cut considered here , the effective scatter at the @xmath25=19 limit will be small .",
    "we conservatively estimate this scatter to be @xmath70=0.05 , and expect a resulting malmquist correction of no more than 0.5% which is insignificant .",
    "our final magnitude limited t dwarf number constraints take account of the above corrections , and assumes poisson uncertainties associated with sample sizes .",
    "we thus estimate that there are 17@xmath44 single @xmath5t4 dwarfs with @xmath12419 in the 280 sq degs of dr2 sky .",

    "statistically our t dwarf numbers are also reasonably consistent ( to within 1.5@xmath70 ) with @xmath161 .",
    "however , they are inconsistent with @xmath7 of 0.5 and 1.0 at the 2.0 and 2.5@xmath70 level respectively .",
    "this result is reasonably consistent with the finding of metchev et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who performed a combined 2mass and sdss t dwarf search and derived a t dwarf space density that was most consistent with @xmath161 ( although based on lower number statistics than here ) .",
    "however , l dwarf mass function constraints suggest higher values of @xmath7 in the 1 - 1.5 range ( reid et al .",
    "1999 ; cruz et al .",
    "the sub - stellar mass function of young open clusters are generally consistent with @xmath172 .",
    "however , a lognormal function also offers a reasonable fit to observation ( see the pleiades mass function in figure 4 of chabrier 2005 ) .",
    "the slope of the lognormal mass function gets steeper as one decreases brown dwarf mass , and for @xmath00.04@xmath173 the lognormal mass function slope is consistent with an @xmath161 power law .",
    "a detailed comparison between mass function constraints from l and t dwarfs is beyond the scope of this paper , however , it may be that differences occur due to the t dwarfs probing a somewhat lower mass range than the l dwarfs .",
    "this would suggest that a single power - law exponent is not optimal when describing the substellar mass function in the field . clearly a greatly improved picture of the mass function will emerge from the las as the survey area grows .",
    "we have discussed our database selection methods and the photometric follow - up that we performed to search for late t dwarfs and even cooler @xmath14=400700k objects in the ukidss las .",
    "these techniques have allowed us to make essentially complete follow - up of our candidates from dr1 and dr2 down to @xmath25=19 .",
    "we have also followed up some candidates from dr3 and a fraction of our fainter candidates from dr1 and dr2 ( to j=19.5 ) .",
    "using a variety of spectroscopic facilities we have measured the spectra of our best candidates , and have spectroscopically confirmed 15 new t dwarfs , bringing the total of number of confirmed las t dwarf discoveries to 28 .    compared to typical t dwarf properties , one of our new t dwarfs may be metal - poor , two may have relatively low surface gravity , one may have higher than normal surface gravity , and one may be metal rich or have low surface gravity .",
    "these assessments are based on comparisons between the spectral morphology and colours of the t dwarfs with theoretical models trends , and are thus somewhat speculative . however , all indications are that t dwarf spectra are quite sensitive to their physical properties , and it seems clear that a better understanding of these variations would have important implications for our ability to model t dwarf atmospheres , and potentially constrain ( via spectroscopy ) the mass , age and composition of t dwarf populations in the field ( e.g. pinfield et al .",
    "2006 ) . to this end",
    ", it would be very beneficial to identify t dwarfs whose properties could be constrained without the need to study their spectra .",
    "both t dwarfs and l dwarfs of this type may be found in widely separated binary systems ( e.g. gizis et al .",
    "2001 ; wilson et al . 2001",
    "; pinfield et al . 2006 ; scholz et al .",
    "2003 ; burgasser et al .",
    "2000 ; luhman et al .",
    "2007 ) for which the primary object can be used to constrain system age and composition .",
    "gl570d and hd3651b ( burgasser 2000 and luhman et al .",
    "2007 ) are good examples , being analysed for age and abundance by geballe et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , burgasser ( 2007 ) and liu leggett & chiu ( 2007 ) .",
    "the large volume ( and large number of t dwarfs ) probed by the las should yield many t dwarfs in such binary systems , and in this context we made a basic search for possible companions to all confirmed las t dwarfs out to a separation of @xmath010,000au ( at the estimated distances in table 5 ) , by querying the simbad astronomical database ( operated at cds ) .",
    "we searched for neighboring objects with either a measured spectral type , a parallax , or a high proper motion , for which we could obtain distance constraints from either parallax or from spectral type and photometry .",
    "these distance constraints allowed us to rule out ( as possible companions ) all the neighboring objects , by comparison with the distance constraints of the t dwarfs .",
    "however , proper motion measurements for all las t dwarfs would facilitate a more general search for common proper motion companions as the number of las t dwarfs grows , which could include white dwarf companions that can yield useful age constraints ( e.g. day - jones et al .",
    "2008 ) and are readily identified in sdss ( e.g. kleinman et al .",
    "2004 ; gates et al . 2004 ; eisenstein et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the number of blue ( @xmath1740.1 ) las t dwarfs discovered with our methods shows statistical evidence for a good level of completeness down to @xmath25=19 .",
    "this builds on our previous work ( e.g. lodieu et al .",
    "2007 ) for which a good level of completion was only achieved to @xmath12618.5 .",
    "the increased size of the las t dwarf sample allowed us to place some statistical constraints on the sub - stellar mass function .",
    "indeed , there may be mounting evidence for a steepening ( decreasing more rapidly with decreasing mass ) sub - stellar mass function in the field , with best - fit @xmath7 values of @xmath175 and between -1.0 and 0.0 for l and t dwarf populations respectively . in any event ,",
    "mass function constraints should be greatly improved by larger samples of las t dwarfs as the survey continues to grow . in addition",
    ", constraints on the brown dwarf birth - rate should be attainable by building on the las l and early t dwarf searches mentioned briefly in section 2.1 ( e.g. fig 3 of deacon & hambly ; fig 10 of burgasser 2004 ) . for instance",
    ", a sample of @xmath0100 l / t dwarfs per @xmath176=100k range from 1100 - 1500k ( assuming a flat birth - rate ) would be capable of ruling out an exponential ( e.g. @xmath1775gyr ) birth - rate at a @xmath05@xmath70 level of significance",
    ". an appropriate sample of @xmath0400",
    "late l to mid t dwarfs could be identified in the full las to @xmath25=18.5 ( for a flat birth - rate ) .",
    "the discovery of the t8.5 dwarf ulas j0034 - 0052 ( warren et al . 2007 ) in the las absolutely demonstrates that ukidss is probing unexplored @xmath14 regimes beyond the previously known late t dwarfs .",
    "having said this , parallax and adaptive optics measurements for this and other very late t dwarfs are important if we are to test for unresolved binarity and better constrain luminosity and @xmath14 . when comparing the colours of ulas j0034 - 0052 with all available las t dwarfs , it is possible that a blue trend in @xmath1 with decreasing t@xmath178 may be present .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 colours might also change beyond t8 , becoming slightly redder and bluer respectively , although this needs further investigation .",
    "these spectral changes would be of great importance not only to our understanding of cool dwarf atmospheres , but also to the potential for finding such objects in the las .",
    "if it is the case that @xmath14=400 - 700k objects become bluer in @xmath1 and redder in @xmath2 than t8 dwarfs , it could be less problematic to identify such candidates to greater @xmath41band depth in multi - band searches of the combined las and sdss databases .",
    "indeed , an evolving set of search criteria takes full advantage of the capabilities offered by large general surveys like ukidss and sdss .",
