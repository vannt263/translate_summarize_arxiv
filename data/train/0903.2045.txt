    "the declining number density of quasars at redshift @xmath7 @xcite points to stellar radiation as a likely source of cosmic hydrogen reionization .",
    "one of the key unknown parameters of reionization models is the escape fraction @xmath8 of ionizing photons from high - redshift galaxies .",
    "observationally , @xmath8 is much easier to estimate at lower redshifts . in local starburst galaxies ,",
    "most studies arrive at typical values @xmath9 @xcite , corresponding to fairly large neutral gas covering factors with hydrogen column densities of @xmath10 and escape of ionizing radiation through relatively few transparent holes in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "starbursts in the disk of our own galaxy feature @xmath11 normal to the disk @xcite , a value which might be a factor of @xmath12 lower when averaged over all directions .",
    "there is strong evidence that the lyman continuum ( lyc ) escape fraction evolves with redshift .",
    "a quantity often measured in high - redshift observations is the relative escape fraction @xmath13 defined as the ratio of the escape fraction of lyman - limit photons @xmath8 to that of @xmath14 photons .",
    "the conversion between @xmath8 and the relative escape fractions depends on the amount of dust attenuation at @xmath14 within each galaxy and is often uncertain @xcite .",
    "large observed samples of @xmath15 starburst galaxies point to fairly low @xmath16 @xcite ; however , the ionizing output changes toward higher redshift . at @xmath17 , from direct detection of lyc emission from 2 of the 14 studied star - forming galaxies @xcite put constraints on the relative escape fraction around @xmath18 . more recently ,",
    "@xcite expanded the search to 198 galaxies at @xmath19 , detecting lyc radiation from seven lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and 10 lyman @xmath20 emitters ( laes ) , estimating that prior to accounting for intergalactic medium ( igm ) attenuation the average relative escape fraction is @xmath21 .",
    "taking into account igm attenuation with a median lyc opacity @xmath22 results in @xmath23 , which in their estimate translates into the average absolute escape fraction @xmath24 , and a lower limit of @xmath25 prior to accounting for igm attenuation .",
    "furthermore , from a comparison of direct observations of the lyc from galaxies and indirect estimates from intergalactic medium ( igm ) ionization , @xcite found evidence for redshift evolution of the average @xmath8 from @xmath26 at @xmath27 to @xmath28 at @xmath29 .",
    "some of the first theoretical estimates of @xmath8 were derived from studies of gas distribution in the milky way and from analytical models of galaxy formation .",
    "@xcite found @xmath30 for ob associations in the galactic disk .",
    "additional absorption comes from the shells of expanding superbubbles which further become rayleigh - taylor unstable , making the problem of calculating @xmath8 dependent on time and on details of star formation @xcite .",
    "analytical estimates of @xmath8 in the cosmological context allowed us to study its dependence on multiple parameters , such as redshift , dark matter halo mass , baryonic fraction , star formation efficiency , and stellar ionizing output @xcite .",
    "more accurate theoretical constraints on @xmath8 can be derived from cosmological hydrodynamical models incorporating star formation and transfer of ionizing radiation in the surrounding gas . at very high redshifts ( @xmath31 )",
    "estimates show that the escape fractions reflect the large masses of population iii stars and can easily approach unity @xcite . in the observable , post - reionization universe , there have been several attempts to compute @xmath8 from cosmological galaxy formation models . in our earlier simulations",
    "@xcite we found that the source - averaged @xmath8 monotonically declines with redshift , from @xmath32 at @xmath33 to @xmath34 at @xmath35 , in line with the observational findings of @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a high - resolution simulation of a lagrangian region of a @xmath36 cosmological model .",
    "the selected region corresponds to five virial radii of a milky way - sized galaxy and includes the milky way progenitor and several dozen smaller galaxies spanning two orders of magnitude in masses and star formation ( sf ) rates . analyzing these galaxies at intermediate ( @xmath37 ) redshifts",
    ", @xcite found that the average escape fractions do not depend on redshift and tend to correlate positively with the sf rate dropping below @xmath38 for galaxies with sf rates less than @xmath39 and dark matter masses below @xmath40 .",
    "such low @xmath8 are explained by the fact that these galaxies have a relatively small gravitational pull and achieve pressure and density necessary for sf only near the midplane of a thick neutral disk .",
    "the resulting sf regions therefore tend to be embedded deep inside the opaque disk .",
    "consequently , @xcite point out that high - redshift galaxies might be quite inefficient in emitting ionizing radiation into the igm .",
    "it is widely agreed that in the absence of energetic supernovae - driven outflows the increased disk density at higher redshifts @xmath41 will result in very low @xmath42 for smooth disks @xcite . on the other hand , simulated galactic disks in cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies",
    "suffer the excessive loss of angular momentum resulting in galaxies that are too small compared to observations @xcite . a plausible solution to this angular momentum problem",
    "is heating via feedback from stars and supernovae that would impede rapid gas cooling and collapse of small protogalactic gas clouds at high redshifts , allowing gas to preserve a larger fraction of its angular momentum as it settles into the disk .",
    "@xcite showed that a population of realistic disk , lenticular , and elliptical galaxies with almost the correct amount of angular momentum can be obtained self - consistently in cosmological simulations by invoking energetic stellar feedback at early times , either through a much higher sf efficiency than in present - day galaxies , a more top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) , or both .",
    "the affected dwarf galaxies would not have time to settle into a disk in which feedback would be rather inefficient @xcite .",
    "instead , they maintain a more spherical or irregular shape resulting in a much stronger impact from stellar feedback .",
    "recently , using very high resolution ( @xmath43 ) coupled radiation hydrodynamics simulations of dwarf galaxies in the mass range @xmath44 at @xmath45 , @xcite showed that the time - averaged @xmath8 can reach up to 80% in halos above @xmath46 with a top - heavy imf , i.e. , in active star - forming galaxies dominated by the atomic line cooling .",
    "it is not clear to what extent @xmath8 depends on the imf as @xcite kept the sn feedback strength equal in their normal and top - heavy imf calculations varying only the ionizing photon production rate . on the other hand , lower mass ( @xmath47 ) ,",
    "molecular cooling galaxies in their simulations have much lower sf efficiency and do not contribute a significant flux to reionize the universe .",
    "irrespective of the mass of the galaxy , @xcite found that @xmath8 can vary by up to an order of magnitude on the timescale of a few myrs which is the dynamical time of a star - forming molecular cloud .",
    "@xcite also found very large escape fractions of order @xmath48 at @xmath49 , analyzing a very high resolution ( @xmath50 ) hydrodynamical model of a supernova - dominated primordial galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , their model is a single isolated galaxy taken out of the cosmological context .    in this paper",
    ", we take an approach complimentary to that of @xcite . even though we do not have their ultra - high resolution and we solve the radiative transfer and ionization equations separately from the equations of hydrodynamics , we examine the escape of ionizing photons from a set of high - resolution reionization - epoch galaxies that evolve into a realistic population of galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , a two - mode sf prescription is adopted , with both the sf efficiency of the `` early '' mode and the feedback strength calibrated to ( 1 ) overcome the angular momentum problem @xcite , and to ( 2 ) produce a reasonable cosmic enrichment history that fits observations @xcite .",
    "this efficient high - z feedback drastically changes the appearance of star - forming galaxies during the reionization era leading to much higher @xmath8 than , e.g. , in @xmath37 dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we describe our galaxy formation models and the technique to compute @xmath8 in [ models ] .",
    "we present the results of our study including the effect of dust absorption in [ results ] , and summarize our findings in [ discussion ] .",
    "we use an improved version of the treesph code @xcite to rerun nine galaxies selected from a larger cosmological simulation .",
    "table  [ galaxies ] lists the following model parameters for each galaxy : physical box size @xmath51 , circular velocity @xmath52 at @xmath1 , mass of an sph and a dark matter particle , and gravitational smoothing lengths for sph and dark matter particles .",
    "the code employs the `` conservative entropy '' formulation @xcite , includes star formation by conversion of sph particles into star particles , and accounts for non - instantaneous recycling of gas and heavy elements via type ii and type ia sne and via stellar mass loss .",
    "chemical evolution is traced using 10 separate elements ( h , he , c , n , o , mg , si , s , ca , and fe ) . all galaxies in table  [ galaxies ] were computed with the salpeter imf which produces a more reasonable cosmic enrichment history than the lower metal yield kroupa imf @xcite .",
    "each galaxy was modeled with at least @xmath53 particles . by @xmath1",

    "[ dusteffects ] shows our results for the two extreme cases , with and without dust sublimation , for two large and one dwarf galaxies . in the sublimation model",
    "stellar photons destroy dust , and therefore with sufficiently large escape fractions the effect of dust on ionizing radiation is nil .",
    "only when the escape fraction is small due to accumulation of neutral hydrogen along the line of sight , we can see some small effect of dust in the sublimation model , e.g. in the massive galaxy s33sc at @xmath106 , where the relative effect of dust is below 0.2% .",
    "its impact is more noticeable in the no - sublimation model .",
    "the true escape fractions probably lie in between these values , as some amount of dust is likely to be destroyed by ionizing radiation .",
    "similar to @xcite , we find that the overall effect of dust is not very large , reducing the escape fractions by few percent at most , explained by the simple fact that photoionization of neutral hydrogen dominates the optical depths .",
    "large escape fractions are only observed at low hydrogen column densities , where dust absorption is usually small .",
    "its effect on the escape of ionizing radiation is more noticeable in massive galaxies at lower redshifts in which the buildup of heavy elements leads to relatively high dust concentrations ( fig .",
    "[ dusteffects ] ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the magnitude of dust absorption is highly uncertain and can range significantly in different studies .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested another simple model of calculating @xmath107 from chemical composition under the following assumptions : ( 1 ) absorption is caused by dust grains ranging in radius from @xmath108 to @xmath109 ; ( 2 ) the size distribution of dust grains scales as @xmath110 ; ( 3 ) the density inside dust grains is constant at @xmath111 ; ( 4 ) the diffraction effects are negligible since @xmath112 ; and ( 5 ) the mass density of dust is @xmath113 .",
    "the resulting dust absorption is proportional to the total gas density , similar to the no - sublimation model of @xcite , but is approximately 25 times weaker than the latter . despite such low cross - sections ,",
    "@xcite find that the escape fractions are significantly regulated by interstellar dust in their isolated supernova - dominated galaxy .",
    "the reason for such a large effect is their relatively strong metal enrichment producing on average solar metallicity ism at @xmath114 ( fig .",
    "[ oxygenabundance ] ) which in addition is very irregular and moderately optically thin for ionizing photons .",
    "observations of uv - selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath115 point to metallicities in the range 0.1 - 0.5 dex below solar @xcite .",
    "if star formation peaks at @xmath116 , metallicities should be substantially lower in the interval @xmath117 we study here .",
    "all models in our set feature a gradual metal enrichment such that most of the massive galaxies have @xmath118}\\sim0.1 - 0.5 $ ] at @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ oxygenabundance ] ) . since the no - sublimation models put an upper limit on dust absorption ( fig .",
    "[ dusteffects ] ) , we conclude that its effect is unlikely to significantly impact the output of ionizing photons in @xmath119 galaxies , except for very rare , unusually massive systems .      for the numerical convergence study , we use an additional model k33 to compare the escape fractions at @xmath120 obtained at standard ( k33 - 64 ) and 8 times the mass resolution ( k33 - 512 ) , while keeping the strength of stellar feedback and the ionizing luminosity per unit stellar mass constant . at these two resolutions ,",
    "this galaxy contains 755 star particles of mass @xmath121 , and 8447 star particles of mass @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "we find the lyman - limit @xmath123 for k33 - 64 , and ( 0.215 , 0.173 , 0.143 ) for k33 - 512 , at @xmath124 , respectively ( fig .  [ resolutionstudy ] ) .",
    "the star formation rate in the higher resolution model is slightly larger , @xmath125 versus @xmath126 , which could explain the observed difference in @xmath8 , since the two quantities should be coupled @xcite .",
    "in addition , we see the increased porosity of the ism in the higher resolution model , with more transparent channels between dense clumps through which radiation can escape . to be conservative , the escape fractions presented in this work should probably be considered as lower limits .",
    "we have coupled high - resolution galaxy formation models with point - source radiative transfer to compute the escape fractions of lyc photons from galaxies at @xmath4 , 8.2 , 6.7 , 5.7 , 5.0 , and 4.4 .",
    "we confirm very large escape fractions of near unity at @xmath92 found by @xcite in dwarf @xmath93 galaxies , conducive to efficient stellar reionization .",
    "the difference between this result and much lower escape fractions in @xmath127 galaxies with similar sf rates at @xmath128 @xcite reflects the model differences between reionization - epoch star - forming galaxies and lower - redshift dwarf galaxies with a relatively low sf efficiency .",
    "there are several physical factors that could account for very different sf efficiencies in @xmath129 galaxies .",
    "these systems are likely to have very low metallicities for which the strength of stellar winds is greatly reduced @xcite , producing less local disruption in star - forming clouds , and leading to higher sf efficiency .",
    "lower metallicities correspond to less efficient cooling ; however , this effect can be offset by the fact that  at a fixed halo mass  higher redshift galaxies are more compact resulting in more efficient cooling .",
    "in addition , there are theoretical expectations of a more top - heavy imf at high redshifts @xcite . a larger fraction of massive stars is likely to yield more efficient feedback on galactic scales , producing a larger number of transparent channels in the ism through which ionizing radiation can escape the galaxy .",
    "all our systems are proto - spiral galaxies residing in a `` field '' environment .",
    "we did not consider more crowded proto - elliptical environments in which evolution is accelerated due to the higher overdensity .",
    "in such galaxies the uv escape fractions could drop quicker with time than what is seen in our current study .",
    "in addition , higher metallicity might amplify the effect of dust although relatively few uv photons would escape from such environments .",
    "we will address more crowded systems in a future study .",
    "we did not compute the effect of ionizing radiation on the hydrodynamical flow which is instead shaped by the thermal feedback energy .",
    "would our results change if we used a coupled radiation - hydrodynamics approach ?",
    "ionizing radiation heats up the gas which can then expand and leave the star - forming region .",
    "@xcite found overall that coupling of radiative transfer and hydrodynamics does not produce a large change in @xmath8 .",
    "for the dwarf galaxies considered by @xcite , they reported fast variations of @xmath8 by up to an order of magnitude on the timescale of a few myrs which is the dynamical timescale of a star - forming molecular cloud .",
    "these changes in @xmath8 are attributed to gas expulsion by winds and supernovae creating transparent channels for ionizing photons . since feedback by winds and",
    "supernovae is already a key part of our hydrodynamical calculations , we argue that our postprocessing of fixed time snapshots of galaxies with radiative transfer with the assumption of ionization equilibrium gives a fairly accurate estimate of the escape fractions . on the other hand , we can not compute @xmath8 variations on short timescales of few myrs , and therefore we can not tell exactly how representative our computed @xmath8 of the time - average escape fractions , something we are hoping to address in the future .",
    "the other possible source of uncertainty in computing @xmath8 is gas clumping on sub - resolution scales .",
    "since for fixed cloud mass and ionization the optical depth scales as @xmath130 with the cloud radius @xmath131 , and recombinations are more efficient at higher densities , the true @xmath8 could be smaller than our current estimates . on the other hand , star - forming clouds are shaped by feedback , and the simple @xmath132 scaling might not be valid . moreover , higher grid resolution would yield a more porous ism , with a strong network of transparent channels through which radiation can escape .",
