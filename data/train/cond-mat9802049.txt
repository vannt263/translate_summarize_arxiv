    "transverse spin fluctuations are gapless , low - energy excitations in the broken - symmetry state of magnetic systems possessing continuous spin - rotational symmetry . therefore at low temperatures they play an important role in diverse macroscopic properties such as existence of long - range order , magnitude and temperature - dependence of the order parameter , nel temperature , spin correlations etc . specifically in the antiferromagnetic ( af ) ground state of the half - filled hubbard model",

    "are enhanced by strong disorder in the hubbard model with random on - site energies . in the strong disorder regime ,",
    "overlap of the two hubbard bands leads to formation of essentially empty and doubly - occupied sites , which act like spin vacancies.@xcite the problem of spin vacancies in the quantum antiferromagnet is also relevant to the electron - doped materials like @xmath11 , where spin - dilution behavior is observed.@xcite while the problem of magnon energy renormalization due to spin vacancies has been addressed recently,@xcite these methods are limited to the low - concentration limit , and the vacancy - induced enhancement in transverse spin fluctuations has not been studied in the whole range of vacancy concentration .    in this paper",
    "we describe a new method for evaluating transverse spin correlations and quantum spin - fluctuation corrections about the hf - level broken - symmetry state , in terms of magnon mode energies and spectral functions obtained in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the method is applicable in the whole @xmath0 range of interaction strength , and is illustrated with three applications involving the af ground state of the half - filled hubbard model  ( i ) the pure model in @xmath12 , ( ii ) spin vacancies in the strong coupling limit in @xmath13 , and ( iii ) low-@xmath3 impurities in @xmath13 .",
    "this method for obtaining quantum correction to sublattice magnetization solely in terms of transverse spin correlations is parallel to the spin - wave - theory ( swt ) approach,@xcite and differs from the method involving self - energy corrections.@xcite    the rpa approach has been demonstrated earlier to properly interpolate between the weak and strong coupling limits for the spin - wave velocity.@xcite by going beyond the rpa level within a systematic inverse - degeneracy expansion scheme , which preserves the spin - rotational symmetry and hence the goldstone mode order by order , it was also shown that in the strong coupling limit identical results are obtained for all quantum corrections , order by order , as from the swt approach for the qhaf.@xcite a renormalized rpa approach has also been devised recently to obtain the magnetic phase diagram for the three dimensional hubbard model in the whole @xmath0 range , and the @xmath14 vs. @xmath3 behaviour was shown to properly interpolate between the weak and strong coupling limits.@xcite",
    "the method is based on a convenient way to perform the frequency integral in order to obtain spin correlations from spin propagators , and we illustrate it here for transverse spin correlations .",
    "we write the time - ordered , transverse spin propagator for sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17|\\psi_{\\rm g}\\rangle$ ] at the rpa level in frequency space as , @xmath18=\\frac{[\\chi^0(\\omega)]}{1-u[\\chi^0(\\omega ) ] } = \\sum_n \\frac{\\lambda_n(\\omega)}{1-u\\lambda_n(\\omega ) }     @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the @xmath21 $ ] matrix . here",

    "the retarded ( advanced ) part of the time - ordered propagator @xmath27 , having pole below ( above ) the real-@xmath28 axis , is to be taken for @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the frequency integral is conveniently replaced by an appropriate contour integral in the lower or upper half - plane in the complex-@xmath28 space for these two cases , respectively , which results in eq .",
    "we first illustrate this method for the half - filled hubbard model in two and three dimensions on square and simple - cubic lattices , respectively . in this case",
    "it is convenient to use the two - sublattice representation due to translational symmetry , and we work with the @xmath32 matrix @xmath33 $ ] in momentum space , which is given in terms of eigensolutions of the hf hamiltonian matrix.@xcite the @xmath34-summation is performed numerically using a momentum grid with @xmath35 and 0.05 , in three and two dimensions , respectively .",
    "equal - time , same - site transverse spin correlations are then obtained from eq .",
    "( 2 ) by summing over the different @xmath36 modes , using a momentum grid with @xmath37 and @xmath38 in three and two dimensions , respectively .",
    "we consider @xmath39 , so that the retarded part is used , with positive mode energies . from spin - sublattice symmetry ,",
    "correlations on a and b sublattice sites are related via @xmath40 .",
    "thus the transverse spin correlations are obtained from magnon amplitudes on a and b sublattices , and from eq .",

    "this is becasue both the rpa and hf approximations are o(1 ) within the inverse - degeneracy expansion scheme@xcite in powers of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is the number of orbitals per site ) , and therefore become exact in the limit @xmath47 , when all corrections of order @xmath45 or higher vanish .",
    "this is indeed confirmed as shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "the deviation at small @xmath3 is because of the neglect in eq .",
    "( 2 ) of the contribution from the single particle excitations across the charge gap , arising from the imaginary part of @xmath48 in eq .",
    "the sum @xmath49 yields a measure of transverse spin fluctuations about the hf state , and in the strong coupling for spin @xmath50 , one obtains @xmath51.@xcite using the identity , @xmath52 in this limit , the sublattice magnetization @xmath53 is then obtained from , @xmath54^{1/2 } .\\ ] ] to order @xmath55 , this yields the correction to the sublattice magnetization of @xmath56=0.156 $ ] and 0.393 for @xmath9 in three and two dimensions , respectively .",
    "this same result at one loop level was also obtained from a different approach in terms of the electronic spectral weight transfer,@xcite and is in exact agreement with the swt result.@xcite    as @xmath57 is the maximum ( classical ) spin polarization in the z - direction , and therefore also the maximum eigenvalue of the local @xmath58 operator , therefore for arbitrary @xmath3 , the hf magnitude @xmath57 plays the role of the effective spin quantum number , @xmath50 .",
    "the sublattice magnetization @xmath59 is therefore obtained from @xmath60 , where the first - order , quantum spin - fluctuation correction @xmath61 is obtained from eq .

    "in both cases it interpolates properly between the weak and strong coupling limits , approaching the swt results 0.607 and 0.844 , respectively , as @xmath2 .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath59 vs. @xmath3 behaviour with earlier results is presented in fig .",

    "results for lattice sizes with @xmath70 are shown in fig .",
    "4 . a quadratic least - square fit is used to extrapolate to infinite system size , which yields @xmath71 , in agreement with the result from eq .",
    "the site representation has also been used to obtain transverse spin fluctuations for the problem of spin vacancies in the af in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "as mentioned already this method is applicable in the whole range of vacancy concentration , and allows determination of the critical vacancy concentration at which the af order parameter vanishes . for the vacancy problem",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian on a square lattice with nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping , @xmath72 where the hopping terms @xmath73 if sites @xmath15 or @xmath16 are vacancy sites , and @xmath74 otherwise .",
    "thus , for a vacancy on site @xmath15 , all hopping terms @xmath75 connecting @xmath15 to its nn sites @xmath16 are set to zero .",
    "the vacancy site is thus completely decoupled from the system .",
    "half - filling is retained by having one fermion per remaining site .",
    "we consider the @xmath2 limit , where the local moments are fully saturated , and the vacancy problem becomes identical to the    spin - vacancy problem in the qhaf .",
    "this is also equivalent to the problem of non - magnetic impurities in the af in the limit of the impurity potential @xmath76.@xcite    the structure of the @xmath48 matrix in the host af , and the modification introduced by spin vacancies has been considered earlier in the context of static impurities.@xcite as the goldstone mode is preserved , it is convenient to work with the matrix @xmath77 $ ] , inverse of which yields the spin propagator in eq .",
    "( 1 ) near the mode energies . when expressed in units of @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the af gap parameter , and @xmath80 , it has the following simple structure for the host af : @xmath81    vacancies introduce a perturbation in @xmath82 due to absence of hopping between the vacancy and nn sites , and we take @xmath83 to refer to this vacancy - induced perturbation , so that @xmath84 . if site @xmath15 is a vacancy site and @xmath16 the nn sites , then the matrix elements of @xmath85 are , @xmath86 and the magnitude of @xmath87 is irrelevant since the vacancy site @xmath15 is decoupled .",
    "thus @xmath88 , reflecting the decoupling of the vacancy , and the static part of the diagonal matrix elements @xmath89 on nn sites are reduced by 1/4 . for @xmath90 vacancies on nn sites ,",
    "the static part is @xmath91 .",
    "this ensures that the goldstone mode is preserved .",
    "thus if a spin on site @xmath16 were surrounded by a maximum of four vacancies on nn sites , then the static part vanishes , and @xmath92 , representing an isolated spin , which yields a @xmath93 pole in the transverse spin propagator .",
    "this is an isolated single - spin cluster , and with increasing vacancy concentration , larger isolated spin clusters are formed .    as these are decoupled from the remaining system , their spin - fluctuation contributions",
    "are not included , as the op vanishes for finite spin clusters .",
    "when @xmath94 exceeds the percolation threshold @xmath95 , the fraction of macroscopically large spin clusters in the system vanishes , and therefore no aflro is possible for @xmath96 .    for a given vacancy concentration and system size",
    ", the appropriate number of vacancies are placed randomly across the lattice , and the matrix @xmath82 constructed accordingly .",
    "exact diagonalization of @xmath82 is carried out , and the eigensolutions are used to compute the transverse spin correlations from eq . ( 2 ) .",
    "the quantum , spin - fluctuation correction is then obtained from the strong - coupling limit of eq .",
    "the transverse spin correlation @xmath97 is averaged over all spins within the a sublattice . as mentioned already , only the spins in the macroscopic cluster spanning the whole lattice are considered , and contributions from spins in isolated spin clusters are excluded .",
    "configuration averaging over several realizations of the vacancy distribution is also carried out .",
    "the quantum spin - fluctuation correction vs. vacancy concentration is shown in fig . 5 for three lattice sizes , @xmath98 .",
    "best fits are obtained with an expression including a cubic term , @xmath99 .",
    "for the three lattice sizes @xmath1000.236 , 0.260 and 0.278 , respectively , and as shown in fig .",
    "3 , it extrapolates to 0.39 as @xmath101 .",
    "the coefficient of the linear term is found to be nearly independent of system size , @xmath102 .",
    "and the cubic term @xmath103 takes values approximately 3.6 , 4.0 , and 4.4 for the three lattice sizes , and extrapolates to about 6.5 as @xmath101 . with these coefficients ,",
    "the spin - fluctuation correction @xmath61 is nearly 1 for @xmath104 . beyond @xmath104 , the percolation limit",
    ", there is no single , macroscopically large spin cluster left in the system .",
    "therefore the point where the af order parameter vanishes and aflro is destroyed due to spin fluctuations nearly coincides with the percolation threshold .",
    "this is in agreement with results from series expansion@xcite and quantum monte carlo simulations@xcite of the qhaf with spin vacancies .",
    "we now consider a quenched impurity model with a random distribution of impurity sites characterized by a local coulomb interaction @xmath105 for the host sites . with h and",
    "i referring to the sets of host and impurity sites respectively , we consider the following hubbard model in the particle - hole symmetric form at half - filling and on a square lattice , @xmath106    the motivations for studying this impurity model are threefold . in view of the observed _ enhancement _ of magnetic order at low concentration of impurities,@xcite we shall analyze the suppression of quantum spin fluctuations to examine whether this is due to a local suppression at the low-@xmath3 sites .",
    "the rpa evaluation of transverse spin correlations is also extended to the case of site - dependent interactions .",
    "furthermore , at half - filling this model also provides a simplistic representation for magnetic impurity doping in an af .",
    "this may appear contradictory in view of the apparently nonmagnetic ( @xmath107 ) nature of the impurity sites .",
    "however , this feature is expressed only away from half - filling.@xcite    the atomic limit @xmath108 provides a convenient starting point for further discussions . in the particle - hole",
    "symmetric form of eq .",
    "( 9 ) , since not only local interaction terms , but the on - site energy terms are also modified ( from @xmath109 to @xmath110 ) at the impurity sites , therefore the energy levels for added hole and particle are @xmath111 and @xmath112 for host and impurity sites respectively . to order @xmath113 , this impurity model therefore canonically maps to the following @xmath9 heisenberg model @xmath114 where in the first term @xmath80 is the conventional exchange coupling between neighboring host spins , and",
    "@xmath115 is the exchange coupling between impurity spins and neighboring host spins . in writing eq .",
    "( 10 ) we have assumed the dilute impurity limit , and discounted the possibility of two impurity spins occupying nn positions , in which case the impurity - impurity exchange coupling will be @xmath116 .    therefore , in the strong correlation limit , this random-@xmath3 model also describes magnetic impurities in the af within an impurity - spin model .",
    "the magnetic - impurity doping is characterized by identical impurity and host spins @xmath117 , but with different impurity - host exchange coupling @xmath118 .",
    "both cases @xmath119 or @xmath120 are possible , and in this paper we have considered the two cases : ( i ) @xmath121 so that @xmath122 , and @xmath123 so that @xmath124 . while this model is easily generalized to other magnetic - impurity models represented by locally modified impurity - host hopping terms @xmath125 , and/or different impurity energy levels , in fact , the essential features are already contained here as the impurity exchange coupling @xmath126 is the relevant quantity in determining the spin fluctuation behavior .",
    "we recast the rpa expression for the transverse spin propagator in a form suitable for site - dependent interactions . in terms of a diagonal interaction matrix",
    "@xmath127 $ ] , with elements @xmath127_{ii}=u_i $ ] , the local coulomb interaction at site @xmath15 , the time - ordered transverse spin propagator at the rpa level can be rewritten , after simple matrix manipulations , as @xmath18= \\frac{[\\chi^{0}(\\omega ) ] } { 1 - [ u ] [ \\chi^{0}(\\omega ) ] } = \\frac{1}{[a(\\omega ) ] } - \\frac{1}{[u]}\\ ] ] where @xmath128=[u ] - [ u][\\chi^0 ( \\omega)][u]$ ] is a symmetric matrix .",
    "as @xmath127 $ ] is non - singular , the singularities in @xmath129 $ ] , which yield the magnon modes , are then given completely by the vanishing of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath130 $ ] . in terms of @xmath131 and @xmath132 , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath130 $ ] , we have @xmath128^{-1 } = \\sum_n \\lambda_n(\\omega)^{-1 }    magnon - mode energies @xmath24 are then given by @xmath133 , and in analogy with eq .",
    "( 2 ) the transverse spin correlations are obtained from , @xmath134    as we are interested in the dilute behaviour , we examine the correction to sublattice magnetization due to two impurities , one on each sublattice for symmetry .",
    "since @xmath135 , corrections to both @xmath136 and @xmath61 are expressed in the dilute limit ( impurity concentration @xmath94 ) as @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "the overall @xmath139 behavior therefore depends on the relative magnitude of the coefficients @xmath140 and @xmath141 . for @xmath142 and @xmath143",
    "we find , at the hf level , that @xmath144 and @xmath145 , both quite independent of system size .    the ( site - averaged ) spin fluctuation correction @xmath61 is obtained from eq .",
    "( 5 ) with and without impurities , and the impurity contribution extracted . for @xmath143",
    "we find a net _ reduction _ in @xmath61 .",
    "divided by @xmath146 , the impurity concentration , this yields the coefficient @xmath141 defined above , and also the per - impurity contribution to the total spin fluctuation correction over the whole lattice .",
    "the spin - fluctuation correction @xmath61 for the pure case , and the per - impurity contribution @xmath147 are shown in fig . 6 for different lattice sizes , along with least - square fits .",
    "it is seen that in the infinite size limit , the per - impurity reduction is nearly 0.2 , which is more than half of the correction per site in the pure case ( 0.35 ) .",
    "thus , there is a substantial reduction in the averaged spin fluctuation correction due to the low@xmath1 impurities .    as the two coefficients @xmath140 and @xmath141 are very nearly the same , the sublattice magnetization @xmath148 shows negligible concentration dependence .",
    "thus the ( relatively small ) reduction in the hf value due to the low-@xmath3 impurities is almost fully compensated by the ( relatively substantial ) reduction in the spin fluctuation correction .",
    "to first order in @xmath94 , we thus find that there is nearly no loss of af order due to the low-@xmath3 impurities .",
    "as mentioned earlier , even a slight enhancement in the af order was recently seen for the case @xmath149.@xcite    we next examine the site - dependence of the local spin fluctuation corrections @xmath150 near the impurities . table i shows that spin fluctuation is actually _ enhanced _ on the low-@xmath3 impurity sites .",
    "the suppression of @xmath150 in the vicinity more than compensates for this local enhancement , resulting in an overall reduction on the average . on the other hand , for @xmath151 , we find that the correction is suppressed on the high-@xmath3 impurity site , while it is enhanced on the average .",
    "thus , to summarize , when the impurity spin is coupled more strongly ( weakly ) , the spin - fluctuation correction is enhanced ( suppressed ) locally at the impurity site , but the average correction to sublattice magnetization is suppressed ( enhanced ) .",
    "this local enhancement can be understood in terms of the correlations @xmath152 as follows . since the impurity spin is more strongly coupled to the neighboring spins , the nn matrix elements @xmath153 are enhanced .",
    "this puts more magnon amplitude @xmath154 on the impurity site , so that from eq .",
    "( 2 ) the transverse spin correlations @xmath152 , and therefore the spin - fluctuation correction , are enhanced for low-@xmath3 impurities . the overall decrease in the averaged fluctuation correction , however , is due to the stiffening of the magnon spectrum in the important low - energy sector , following from the increased average spin coupling .",
    ".the local spin - fluctuation corrections @xmath155 for a @xmath156 system ( @xmath142 ) , with two impurities at ( 11,4 ) and ( 4,14 ) .",
    "for the two cases @xmath143 ( @xmath157 ) and @xmath151 ( @xmath158 ) , quantum corrections are enhanced / suppressed locally at the impurity sites ( indicated in boldfaces ) , but are suppressed / enhanced on the average . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     2    while these results also follow from the impurity - spin picture , the small charge gap at the impurity site does have an impact on the magnon spectrum . within the localized spin picture",
    ", the highest - energy magnon mode corresponding to a local spin deviation at the impurity site would cost energy @xmath159 .",
    "however , the highest energy in the magnon spectrum is actually seen to be @xmath160 , which is substantially smaller than @xmath161 .",
    "this shows the compression effect of the low charge gap ( @xmath162 ) on the magnon spectrum.@xcite    in conclusion , using a convenient numerical method for evaluating transverse spin correlations at the rpa level , quantum spin - fluctuation corrections to sublattice magnetization are obtained for the half - filled hubbard model in the whole @xmath0 range .",
    "results in two and three dimensions are shown to interpolate properly between both the weak and strong correlation limits , and approach the swt results as @xmath2 .",
    "the method is readily extended to other situations of interest involving defects in the af , such as vacancies / impurities / disorder .",
    "numerical diagonalization for finite lattices , along with finite - size scaling tested with the pure hubbard model , allows for exact treatment of defects at the rpa level .",
    "this is illustrated with a study of the defect - induced enhancement / suppression in transverse spin fluctuations for spin vacancies and low-@xmath3 impurities in two dimensions .",
    "while the quantum spin fluctuation correction to sublattice magnetization is sharply enhanced by spin vacancies , it is strongly suppressed by the low-@xmath3 impurities , although the fluctuation correction is enhanced at the low@xmath1 sites .",
