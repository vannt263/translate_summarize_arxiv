    "a significant distinction exists between the conceptual framework presented in traditional introductory physics courses and that used in the advanced physics courses that follow them @xcite .",
    "introductory physics courses utilize historical newtonian concepts involving forces and accelerations , but these concepts never enter in more advanced formulations . the introductory approach is often characterized as `` classical '' whereas that of the more advanced is described as `` quantum mechanical . ''",
    "however , the primary difference between the two approaches arises not because of quantization , but instead from a nonessential heuristic tendency to describe macroscopic systems by instantaneous values for position , speed , and acceleration , and microscopic systems by time - averaged position probability densities .",
    "the reasons for this are clear , since a macroscopic trajectory is disturbed only slightly when successively interrogated with visible light , whereas a microscopic system may be destroyed by interrogation with a single short - wavelength photon .",
    "thus the description of the microscopic system requires the superposition of many similarly interrogated systems .",
    "unfortunately , this dichotomy produces a serious disconnect between physics as it is taught to non - major students in service courses and physics as it is practiced . despite efforts to inject modern topics into a newtonian presentation , this discontinuity further widens the gap between physics and society .    in a recent essay ,",
    "wilczek @xcite has described the force concept as an insubstantial `` culture '' that provides a common language , but not an algorithm for constructing the mechanics of the world .",
    "similarly , taylor @xcite has suggested an alternative approach that uses the least action principle in place of newtonian forces .",
    "both essays provide persuasive historical quotes from respected authorities who have urged that the force approach to the teaching of elementary physics be replaced .",
    "unfortunately , the newtonian model offers practical advantages , particularly in the testing and evaluation of student performance , and is thus very firmly entrenched .",
    "it is sometimes argued that initial use of the newtonian approach is necessary , because a quantum mechanical formulation would be too demanding mathematically .",
    "however , the problems attacked in elementary textbooks tend to be simpler than those treated in quantum mechanical textbooks .",
    "if one examines problems of similar complexity , a newtonian formulation is often much more complex mathematically than the corresponding quantum mechanical solution .",
    "for example , elementary textbooks describe the two - dimensional kepler orbit problem , but it is invariably restricted to the special case of a circular orbit ( or , in the flat earth approximation , to a parabolic trajectory ) . when the classical problem is formulated in terms of position probability densities , three - dimensional elliptic orbits",
    "are automatically included .",
    "moreover , deviations from a pure inverse square law can be included as perturbations @xcite , all in a purely classical framework .",
    "it is also possible to add semiclassical quantization directly to the classical solution when desired .",
    "a formulation is presented here in which the periodic three - dimensional motion of a particle in a central potential is treated in terms of classical position probability densities .",
    "the method is applied to the problems most frequently encountered in an introductory quantum mechanics course , namely the kepler - coulomb and isotropic harmonic oscillator potentials .",
    "while these two potentials lead to solutions that possess certain symmetries , they also have interesting differences .",
    "for example , the kepler - coulomb exemplifies an interaction that decreases with increasing separation , whereas the isotropic harmonic oscillator exemplifies an interaction that increases with increasing separation .    in this presentation",
    "the position probability densities are evaluated , closed form expressions for the average values for powers of the radial coordinate are obtained , calculations are made for sample perturbations of the systems , and the connection to the ebk semiclassical quantization is prescribed .",
    "consider a particle of mass @xmath0 moving in a central potential @xmath1(@xmath2 ) described by the standard spherical polar coordinates @xmath2 , @xmath3 . for periodic motion with period @xmath4 , the dwell time , or position probability density ,",
    "is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the radial component of the momentum of the particle , which can be described using conservation of energy as @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the angular momentum .",
    "for a prescribed potential , the radial momentum can be obtained as @xmath9 with periodic orbital motion , the radial coordinate will undergo librations between turning points that are specified by the roots of the equation @xmath10 for the potentials considered here there will be two roots to the equation , denoted as @xmath11 . since the potential involves only @xmath2 , the angular momentum will be constant over the orbit . in the case of the kepler - coulomb and isotropic harmonic oscillator potentials ,",
    "the orbits are both ellipses , so kepler s second law of equal areas swept out in equal times is valid for both .",
    "thus @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the semimajor and semiminor axes of the ellipse , and @xmath15 is its cross sectional area .",
    "this equation permits the specification of the period , which provides the normalization of the distribution .",
    "if @xmath16 denotes the number of librations in a period ( @xmath16=2 for the kepler - coulomb , @xmath17=4 for the harmonic oscillator ) , then the average values of powers of @xmath2 are given by @xmath18      the potential @xmath19 gives rise to a negative ( binding ) energy , which we denote as @xmath20 so as to explicitly display the sign within square roots .",

    "the turning points are at the semimajor and semiminor axes @xmath34 and the period corresponds to four of these turning points .",
