    "@xmath6 : @xmath7    in the case @xmath8 of finite dimensional complex representations of a finite group @xmath2 ( respectively @xmath9 which has the same drinfeld center ) computing the brauer - picard group is already an interesting and non - trivial task .",
    "this group appears as the symmetry group of ( extended ) dijkgraaf - witten theories with structure group @xmath2 .",

    "the authors use the isomorphism to @xmath15 in order to compute the brauer - picard group for several groups @xmath2 using the following strategy : they enumerate all subcategories @xmath16 that are braided equivalent to @xmath8 , then they prove that @xmath15 acts transitively on this set .",
    "finally , they determine the stabilizer of the standard subcategory @xmath17 with trivial braiding .    for @xmath2 abelian , the second author s joint paper @xcite determines a set of generators of the brauer - picard group and provides a field theoretic interpretation of the isomorphism @xmath18 in terms of 3d - dijkgraaf - witten theory with defects .",

    "natural questions for applications are :    the elements of @xmath62 are by definition realized as different bimodule category structures of the abelian categories @xmath4 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "what are the bimodule categories associated to the partial dualizations ?",
    "what are the three types of group extensions of the fusion category @xmath4 associated by the isomorphism in @xcite to the two subgroups and to partial dualizations ?",

    "additionally , these generators have an interesting field theoretic interpretation ( see next page ) .",
    "+ in the present article we consider the case @xmath49 with @xmath2 a finite group , hence @xmath9 , @xmath63 ; in this case the subgroups @xmath64 and to a lesser extend @xmath65 are well - known . as a main result , we prove that the decomposition described in question [ q_decomposition ] holds for the subgroup of elements in @xmath66 , which fulfill the additional cohomological property of _ laziness_.",
    "this condition is automatically fulfilled in the case that @xmath2 is abelian .",
    "further , for some known examples , we check that the decomposition holds also for the full brauer - picard group ( see section [ sec_examples ] ) .",
    "one important example is the following    let @xmath67 with @xmath68 a prime number .",
    "fixing an isomorphism @xmath69 , we have the following group isomorphism : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the group of invertible matrices in @xmath72 that are invariant under @xmath73 . in this case , the images of @xmath74 resp .",

    "+ from a mathematical physics perspective these subgroups arise as follows : a dijkgraaf - witten theory has as input data a finite group @xmath2 and a @xmath85-cocycle @xmath86 on @xmath2 .",
    "it is a topological gauge theory with principal @xmath2-bundles on a manifold @xmath87 as classical fields . since for a finite group @xmath2 all @xmath2-bundles are flat",
    ", they already form the configuration space .",
    "the @xmath86 corresponds to a lagrangian functional ( in our article @xmath86 is trivial ) .",
    "we are interested in the symmetry group of the quantized theory , which is per definition the group of invertible defects and hence @xmath66 .    based on this gauge theoretic view",
    ", it is natural to expect automorphisms of @xmath2 to be a symmetry of the classical and the quantized theory .",
    "indeed , @xmath88 is a subgroup of @xmath84 and since it already exists at the classical level , we call this a classical symmetry ( see proposition [ vcat ] ) .",
    "it is both , a subgroup of @xmath89 and a subgroup of @xmath90 .",
    "more symmetries can be obtained by the following idea : equivalence classes of gauge fields are principal @xmath2-bundles and thus are in bijection with homotopy classes of maps from @xmath87 to @xmath91 , the classifying space of @xmath2 .",
    "one may view a dijkgraaf - witten theory based on @xmath92 as a @xmath93-model with target space @xmath91 .",
    "then the @xmath85-cocycle @xmath86 can be viewed as a background field on the target space , and the choice of @xmath86 corresponds to the choice of a @xmath12-gerbe . even for trivial @xmath86",
    "we obtain a non - trivial symmetry group of this @xmath12-gerbe and hence an additional subgroup of automorphisms of the theory .",

    "our subgroup @xmath95 where @xmath96 is therefore the semidirect product of the two classical symmetry groups from above ( see proposition [ lm_bfield ] ) .",
    "an interesting implication of our result is that in order to obtain the full automorphism group one considers a second @xmath93-model ( the dual @xmath93-model ) associated to @xmath63 which however leads to the same quantum field theory .",
    "this dual @xmath93-model induces another subgroup of background field symmetries @xmath97 which is a subgroup of @xmath90 ( see proposition [ efield ] ) .",
    "however , the group @xmath90 is _ not _ a semidirect product of @xmath97 and @xmath98 in general .",
    "the elements in @xmath60 have the field theoretic interpretation of so - called _ partial em - dualities _ ( electric - magnetic - dualities ) . in so - called quantum double models ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) , irreducible representations of @xmath99 have the interpretation of quasi - particle charges ( anyon charges ) .",

    "partial dualizations @xmath60 are symmetries of the quantized theory that exchange magnetic and electric charges ( see proposition [ pcat ] and section [ sec_nonlazyreflection ] ) .",
    "these are only present at the quantum level , hence we call them quantum symmetries . + for the lazy brauer - picard group , which incorporates the abelian case as a special case , it is enough to dualize on direct abelian factors of @xmath2 .",
    "a partial dualization is then induced by a hopf automorphisms of @xmath105 ( proposition [ pcat ] ) .",
    "for the general brauer - picard group , we need to consider semi - direct abelian factors of @xmath2 .",

    "further , we give some basic facts about hopf bigalois objects , these are certain @xmath107-bicomodule algebras @xmath37 such that the functor @xmath108 gives an element in @xmath109 - all monoidal equivalences of @xmath1 arise in this way for some bigalois object . a special class of bigalois objects is given by _",
