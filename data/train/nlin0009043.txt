    "as it is known , despite of the fact that magnetism is an essentially quantum effect , a wide range of magnetic phenomena can be successfully described in the framework of classical models .",
    "one of the most widely used of such models is the one by landau and lifshitz , when magnetic is considered in the continuous limit and interaction between magnetic dipoles is taken into account in terms of some effective magnetic field .",
    "the simplest case of the landau  lifshitz model is the case of the so - called isotropic continuous heisenberg ferromagnetic spin system , which is governed by the equation @xmath2 , \\qquad \\vec s^{2 } = 1 .",
    "\\label{heis}\\ ] ] here @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the two - dimensional laplacian , @xmath5 .",
    "this equation attaches much attention not only from the viewpoint of its application in the physics of magnetic phenomena , but also from the viewpoint of the theory of integrable nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "it is known that in the @xmath6-dimensional case , @xmath7 , \\label{heis11}\\ ] ] this equation , which has been discussed in a large number of publications ( see @xcite as well as the books @xcite and references therein ) , can be solved using the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) .",
    "another well studied reduction of ( [ heis ] ) is the static two - dimensional case , which may be referred to as @xmath8-dimensional one , @xmath9 = 0 , \\label{heis02}\\ ] ] ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and which is closely related to the elliptic sine - gordon model .",
    "the subject of the present paper are the stationary structures of the isotropic two - dimensional classical continuous heisenberg spin system and we look for solutions of ( [ heis ] ) which are of the form @xmath10 ( the so - called tijon ",
    "wright ansatz with zero frequency  @xcite ) .    of course , this reduction ( like any other ansatz ) is a necessity , if we want to proceed analytically , and is due to the fact that we can not at present integrate the original @xmath0-dimensional equation .    on the other hand , the stationary structures which are discussed below are of much interest for the physics of magnetism and nonlinear physics in general since they are realization of the so - called dynamical solitons . in physics of magnetic phenomena there",
    "exist two types of localized structures .",
    "first is the domain walls ( kinks ) which connect two different ground states and which can not be destroyed without remagnetising regions of macroscopic sizes ( that is why they are called ` topological solitons ' ) .",
    "another type is solitons , which can be viewed as bound states of a huge number of magnons .",
    "the question of their existence and stability , contrary to the case of the topological solitons , is not so trivial . in some sense , they exist due to the presence of some conserved quantities such as number of magnons , total momentum and energy  @xcite .",
    "these are the only physical constants of motion which do not depend on the model we use ( as to an infinite number of conservation laws appearing , e.g. , in @xmath6-dimensional landau  lifshitz equation , they seem to be an attribute of the model and do not survive when we move to a more realistic one ) .",
    "the moving stationary structures are the simplest field configurations for which all of the constants are non - zero , i.e. they are the simplest of general ( or non - degenerate ) ones .",
    "studying these structures one can explicitly see the interaction of the nonlinearity and dispersion which is known to be the core mechanism of creation of localized objects ( solitons ) not only in magnetic systems but in many other areas of the nonlinear physics .",
    "after substitution ( [ stationary ] ) equation ( [ heis ] ) becomes @xmath11 + \\left ( \\vec v , \\nabla \\vec s \\right ) = 0 .",
    "\\label{mainvec_eq}\\ ] ] introducing the variables @xmath12 , \\qquad \\bar z = \\frac{v}{4 g } \\left [ x - v_{x}t - i ( y - v_{y}t ) \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , we can rewrite it as @xmath14 + \\lambda^{2 } \\vec s_{z } + \\lambda^{-2 } \\vec s_{\\bar z } = 0 \\label{tijon}\\ ] ] or , equivalently , as @xmath15 = 0 \\label{veczz}\\ ] ] with @xmath16 , where the angle @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "equation  ( [ tijon ] ) is known to be integrable ( its zero - curvature representation ( zcr ) one can find in the paper  @xcite ) , and one can tackle it by elaborating the corresponding inverse scattering transform .",
    "however , in the present paper we do not discuss this question .",
    "our aim is to establish the relations between the model considered and the other integrable models , which will provide us with a wide range of physically interesting solutions .    for our further purposes",
    "it is convenient to rewrite  ( [ veczz ] ) in the matrix form using the correspondence @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the pauli matrices @xmath22 equation ( [ veczz ] ) then can be presented as @xmath23 = 0 . \\label{main_eq}\\ ] ] namely this equation is the central object of our investigation .",
    "we will use the following remarkable fact : equation ( [ main_eq ] ) is gauge equivalent to the @xmath24 nonlinear @xmath25-model @xcite in the similar way as , e.g. , the @xmath6-dimensional classical continuous heisenberg ferromagnetic spin system ( [ heis11 ] ) is equivalent to the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( see @xcite ) , or the ishimori magnetic @xcite  to the davey  stewartson system ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this equivalence can be briefly described in terms of the ist as follows : some combinations of the jost functions of the linear problem associated with the @xmath24 @xmath25-model solve equation ( [ main_eq ] ) ( below we shall discuss this question more comprehensively ) .",
    "the fact that model ( [ veczz ] ) , or ( [ main_eq ] ) , is related to the @xmath24 nonlinear @xmath25-model is a generalization of the already known result ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that in the static case equation ( [ heis02 ] ) is gauge equivalent to the elliptic sine - gordon equation .",
    "the @xmath24 @xmath25-model , as it has been shown in  @xcite , is , in its turn , closely related to the ablowitz ",
    "ladik hierarchy ( alh )  @xcite .",
    "so we shall establish the direct links between the model considered and the alh , which is much more well - studied than equations  ( [ mainvec_eq ] ) , ( [ main_eq ] ) or models  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we first derive the gauge equivalence between the heisenberg equation and the alh ( sections  [ sec_heisalh ] , [ sec_gauge ] ) and then use it to obtain soliton solutions ( section  [ sec_sol ] ) and the elliptical quasiperiodic ones ( section  [ sec_qps ] ) .",
    "the method used here , which may be called the ` embedding into the alh ' method , has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "its main idea is that some equations can be , in some sense , ` derived ' from the system of differential - difference equations ( dde ) belonging to the alh , which means that any common solution of several equations from the alh also solves the equation we are dealing with .",
    "relatively to the problem considered this can be briefly outlined as follows .",
    "consider the system of two equations from the alh , @xmath26 where @xmath27 equation ( [ dnlse ] ) is the well - known discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnlse ) @xcite , modified by the substitution @xmath28 , while the next one , ( [ dmkdv ] ) , is the discrete modified kdv equation ( dmkdv ) @xcite .",
    "these equations can be rewritten in terms of the complex variables @xmath29 , @xmath30 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 stands for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "it is very important that these equations are compatible , since they belong to the same hierarchy , and the constants of motion that play the role of the hamiltonians for the flows ( [ dnlse ] ) , ( [ dmkdv ] ) are in involution .",
    "hence , we can consider them simultaneously , as one system of two equations .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite , and one can easily verify this fact by simple calculations , that , for any fixed @xmath36 , each solution of system ( [ dnlse ] ) , ( [ dmkdv ] ) also solves the field equations of the @xmath24 nonlinear @xmath25-model , @xmath37 and that the quantities @xmath38 satisfy the 2d toda lattice equations @xmath39 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "namely this we bear in mind when say that the o(3,1 ) nonlinear @xmath25-model and the 2d toda lattice can be ` embedded ' into the alh .",
    "the situation with the heisenberg spin system is somewhat more difficult .",
    "solution for equation ( [ main_eq ] ) can not be constructed by means of @xmath40 s and @xmath41 s only . to do that we have to consider the zcr for the alh and to analyze the corresponding linear problems .",
    "the integrable ddes ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ -1 ] ) , as well as all equations of the alh , can be presented as the compatibility condition for the linear system @xmath42 where @xmath43 and the matrices @xmath44 , @xmath45 are given by @xmath46 one can easily see that equations ( [ zcr - sp ] ) , ( [ zcr - evolp ] ) and ( [ zcr - sp ] ) , ( [ zcr - evoln ] ) are compatible only if matrices @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 satisfy the so - called zero - curvature equations @xmath50 and @xmath51 which are equivalent to ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ -1 ] ) correspondingly .",
    "namely the solutions of the linear problems ( [ zcr - sp])([zcr - evoln ] ) , @xmath52 s , are the key objects of our consideration and the main result of this paper can be formulated as follows : for any  @xmath36 , matrices @xmath53 constructed of solutions of the linear problems of the alh solve the matrix landau ",
    "lifshitz equation ( [ main_eq ] ) .    to derive this result",
    "consider matrices @xmath54 , @xmath55 defined by @xmath56 where @xmath21 is a pauli matrix ( [ pauli ] ) , and @xmath52 , recall , is a matrix solution of system ( [ zcr - sp ] ) , ( [ zcr - evoln ] ) ( in this notation @xmath57 ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ zcr - evolp ] ) , ( [ zcr - evoln ] ) that @xmath58   \\psi_{n } , \\qquad \\bar\\partial \\sigma^{a}_{n } = \\psi_{n}^{-1 } \\left [ \\sigma^{a } , w_{n } \\right ]   \\psi_{n}.\\ ] ] using expressions ( [ vw ] ) for @xmath44 and @xmath45 one can find the derivatives of the matrices @xmath59 in terms of the matrices @xmath60 given by @xmath61 as follows : @xmath62 these relations together with analogous expressions for the derivatives @xmath63 , @xmath64 and formulae ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ -1 ] ) , after straightforward calculations , omitted here , lead us to @xmath65 noting that @xmath66 and @xmath67 = 4i \\left ( \\lambda r_{n-1 } - \\lambda^{-1 } r_{n } \\right ) s_{n}^{+ } + 4i \\left ( \\lambda q_{n } - \\lambda^{-1 } q_{n-1 } \\right ) s_{n}^{-}\\ ] ] ( both of these formulae follow from ( [ dsdz ] ) , ( [ dsdbz ] ) ) we obtain that for every @xmath36 the matrix  @xmath59 solves the equation @xmath68 = 0\\ ] ] which is the main equation of our study , ( see ( [ main_eq ] ) ) .",
    "this key result of the present paper can be reformulated in terms of the vector @xmath69 , which corresponds to the matrix @xmath59 and which can be presented as @xmath70 where @xmath71 ( here @xmath72 are the elements of the matrix @xmath52 ) , as follows : for each @xmath36 the vector @xmath69 defined by ( [ vecsn ] ) , ( [ vecsn123 ] ) solves equation ( [ veczz ] ) .",
    "thus we have established the links between equation ( [ main_eq ] ) , or ( [ veczz ] ) , describing stationary moving structures in the @xmath0-dimensional classical continuous heisenberg spin system and the alh .",
    "some more detailed analysis of the gauge equivalence between these models one can find in the next section .",
    "however , in this work we are going to focus our attention on ` practical ' aspects of this relation , so a reader can consider it as an ` empirical ' fact which can be straightforwardly , and rather easily , verified by the calculations outlined above .    as was mentioned earlier , model ( [ tijon ] )",
    "is known to be integrable and its zero - curvature representation has already been written out .",
    "but , to our knowledge , the corresponding ist has not been elaborated yet , while the alh is one of the best - studied nonlinear integrable models . besides , the heisenberg equation is a vector problem , which somehow complicates inverse scattering analysis , while the alh is a scalar one .",
    "so , to our opinion , the ` embedding into the alh ' approach is rather promising and in what follows we demonstrate its usefulness by constructing the soliton and quasiperiodic solutions for the equations considered using the already known solutions for the alh .",
    "the magnetic energy density , @xmath73 , @xmath74 = \\frac { g}{2 } \\left ( \\nabla \\vec s , \\nabla \\vec s \\right ) \\label{w}\\ ] ] of the field configurations obtained by the embedding into the alh method can be expressed in terms of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 s : @xmath75 = - \\frac { v^{2}}{4 g } \\left ( q_{n}r_{n } + q_{n-1}r_{n-1 } \\right ) .",
    "\\label{wqr}\\ ] ]    it can be shown that from the viewpoint of application of solutions of the alh equations to the description of the vector field @xmath76 one has restrict himself with the case of @xmath77 , @xmath78 when the components of the vector @xmath69 ( [ vecsn ] ) are real ( in the opposite case , @xmath79 , the components of @xmath59 are complex ) and the magnetic energy ( [ wqr ] ) is positive .    in the next section we will consider the relation between equation ( [ main_eq ] ) and the alh in the framework of the ist .",
    "in the previous section we considered the relation between the alh and the landau  lifshitz equation in terms of _ solutions _ : we demonstrated how to use solutions of the alh to obtain ones for the landau ",
    "lifshitz equation .",
    "now we are going to discuss this question in somewhat more general way .",
    "both the alh and the landau ",
    "lifshitz equations are integrable models and it is interesting to describe this correspondence in the language of the ist and to derive links between the auxiliary linear problems which are used to present the integrable models in the zero curvature form ( namely this is usually understood when one uses the words ` gauge equivalence ' ) .    let us consider again the auxiliary linear problems of the alh mentioned in section  [ sec_heisalh ] .",
    "to our current purposes we do not need the discrete problem  ( [ zcr - sp ] ) and will be dealing with the continuous ones ( [ zcr - evolp ] ) , ( [ zcr - evoln ] ) .",
    "so , we omit now the index @xmath36 and rewrite ( [ zcr - evolp ] ) , ( [ zcr - evoln ] ) , ( [ vw ] ) as @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( we have replaced @xmath40 , @xmath41 with @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 with @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) . in what follows we denote the spectral parameter by @xmath89 and use @xmath90 for its particular value appearing in the definition  ( [ sigma ] ) of the matrix @xmath91 , @xmath92 the compatibility ( zero - curvature ) condition for the system ( [ zcr - evol - g ] ) @xmath93 = 0 \\label{zcr - g}\\ ] ] leads to the following system of four _ partial differential equations _ ( pde ) for four unknown functions @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 : @xmath94 this system is in some sense intermediate between the ddes ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ -1 ] ) and the pde ( [ o31 ] ) : both of them can be ` reconstructed ' from ( [ q0-g])([r0-g ] ) ( we will return to this question below ) . and namely system ( [ q0-g])([r0-g ] ) is , strictly speaking , gauge equivalent to the spin field equation we are dealing with .",

    "the ist has been originally developed for the cauchy problems . however , since then much efforts has been made to adjust this method for various boundary value problems .",
    "this is a rather difficult task since the latter seem to be more difficult than the former ones . among successes in this field",
    "one should mention results related to the hyperbolic systems such as , e.g , the sine - gordon equation , the principal chiral field equations etc .",
    "for these models the initial value ",
    "boundary value problems has been shown to be well stated problems , the existence and uniqueness of the solution has been established and ist - based algorithms to solve , say , the goursat type boundary problem have been elaborated .",
    "one can find discussion of some recent results on boundary problems for the @xmath6-dimensional systems on semi - infinite and finite interval , for example in @xcite .",
    "as to the elliptical systems , similar to the one discussed here , which do not possess characteristics , it is also possible to apply the ist for solving some boundary value problems .",
    "usually it is achieved by breaking the symmetry between the coordinates ( which is , of course , not very natural for this kinds of equations ) , selecting one of them ( say , @xmath112 ) , considering the problem on a half - plane ( @xmath113 ) or on a finite domain ( in this case the part of the boundary data plays role of the cauchy conditions ) and performing analysis ( i.e.  solving the direct and inverse spectral problems ) for the auxiliary linear equation corresponding to the complementary coordinate ( say , @xmath114 ) .",
    "one can find examples of such approach in @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , in this paper we do not discuss the mathematically rigorous formulation of the problem related to ( [ veczz ] ) .",
    "we consider here the ist as a method to generate some classes of particular solutions and restrict ourselves to the ones most interesting from the physical viewpoint , solitons and quasiperiodic solutions .    above",
    "we have mapped the @xmath48-@xmath49 pair for system ( [ q0-g])([r0-g ] ) into the @xmath101-@xmath102 pair for equation ( [ main_eq ] ) by means of the gauge transformation ( [ phi - g ] ) , @xmath115 now we are going to derive the inverse transform : from ( [ zcr - evol - ll ] ) to ( [ zcr - evol - g ] ) ( i.e.  from the @xmath48-@xmath49 pair ( [ v - ll ] ) , ( [ w - ll ] ) to ( [ v - alh ] ) , ( [ w - alh ] ) ) . the fist step is to diagonalize a solution of the landau ",

    "we have an example of the situation studied by levi , benguria @xcite , shabat , yamilov @xcite and others : discrete integrable equations ( the equations from the alh in our case ) describe sequences of the bcklund transformations for some pdes ( the stationary @xmath0-dimensional landau  lifshitz equation in our case )",

    "then we can construct the new @xmath116-matrix @xmath140 , and the new spin field @xmath141 which corresponds to the matrix @xmath142 .",

    "one can find typical two - soliton spin distribution in the fig .",
    "the alh in the quasiperiodic case is less studied than in the soliton one .",
    "several authors have discussed the quasiperiodic solutions ( qps ) for the discrete nonlinear schrdinger and the discrete modified korteveg - de vries equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but their results are not enough to construct the corresponding solutions for the heisenberg equation using the ` embedding into the alh ' method . what we need and what is absent in the papers  @xcite is a solution of the auxiliary system ( [ zcr - sp])([zcr - evoln ] ) which in the quasiperiodic case is known as the baker  akhiezer function .",
    "later this question was solved in @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "however , these results , describing general finite - genus solutions , are rather cumbersome , so here we restrict ourselves only to the elliptic solutions , which are the simplest qps .    the elliptic solutions for system ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ -1 ] ) possess the following structure : @xmath252 where @xmath253 is one of the elliptic theta - functions ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , the phase @xmath254 is some linear function of the coordinates @xmath255 and @xmath256 ( it will be specified below ) , @xmath257 and the constants @xmath258 , @xmath259 are related by @xmath260 the quantities @xmath38 s can be presented as @xmath261 which follows from expressions ( [ qp_qr ] ) and the identity @xmath262 this identity is the fay s formulae @xcite for the elliptic functions .",

    "these formulae ( we do not present here the corresponding derivation procedure ) can be verified straightforwardly using ( [ psi_fay ] ) and ( [ fay ] ) .",

    "it should be noted that to ensure reality of all physical quantities , such as @xmath291 , @xmath73 one has to impose some restrictions on the parameters @xmath292 , @xmath293 and @xmath278 ( or @xmath294 ) which appear in the above expressions .",
    "we can not at present formulate these restrictions in their general form , but will show below how these parameters should be chosen in some particular case , which is a  generalization of the pure soliton one , in the sense that the one - soliton solutions obtained in section  [ sec_sol ] are some limiting cases ot the elliptical ones discussed below .",
    "thus , in what follows we restrict ourselves with the case of @xmath295 where @xmath296 is the complex half - period of the @xmath253-function ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it can be shown that in this case both the components of the vector @xmath76 and the energy @xmath73 will be real if we choose @xmath297 where hats indicate that correspondent quantities are real . in what follows we use together with the theta - functions also the jacobian elliptical functions @xmath298 , @xmath299 and @xmath300 , @xmath301 with @xmath302 ( the definition of @xmath303 and analogous formulae for @xmath304 and @xmath305 one can find , e.g. , in  @xcite ) .",
    "the ` coordinate ' @xmath306 can be written now as @xmath307 where @xmath308 the expressions for @xmath196 and @xmath229 ( [ tg_theta_ell ] ) and ( [ varphi_ell ] ) , ( [ hatvarphi_ell ] ) can be presented as @xmath309 and @xmath310 . \\label{ell_varphi}\\ ] ] the vector @xmath311 is given by @xmath312    \\vec k_{\\bot},\\ ] ] where @xmath313 while the vector @xmath314 is given by ( [ kappa_par_ell ] ) with @xmath315 and @xmath316 is related to @xmath317 and @xmath318 by @xmath319    it is straightforward to show that the limiting case of the elliptic quasiperiodic solutions presented above is solitons obtained in section  [ sec_sol ] .",
    "indeed , with the parameter @xmath320 ( [ ell_k ] ) going to zero ( which corresponds to @xmath321 ) , the elliptic functions sn , cn and dn become sin , cos and 1 correspondingly . noting that @xmath322 and identifying @xmath323 with @xmath324 ( which implies @xmath325 ) one can transform ( [ ell_tan ] ) and ( [ ell_varphi ] ) to formulae ( [ sol_tan ] ) and ( [ varphione ] ) describing solutions of the landau  lifshitz equation in the one - soliton case .",
    "to conclude , we want to summarize the main results and to outline some perspectives of the studies discussed in this paper . from the mathematical point of view , our main result is the established relation between the landau ",
    "lifshitz equation ( in the case @xmath326 ) and the alh . and",
    "though we can not at present provide general explanation of what makes such apparently different models be so closely connected , we hope that the results presented in sections [ sec_sol ] , [ sec_qps ] are rather convincing arguments in favour of the fact that this relation is useful , at least from the practical standpoint , as a tool for generating of a large number of solutions . on the other hand , this work presents 2d stationary structures of the isotropic continuous heisenberg ferromagnetic spin system which have not been , to our knowledge , discussed in the literature and which seem to be interesting for the physics of magnetic phenomena .",
    "it should be noted that we have obtained our results in the framework of the classical model , and one of the most important questions that should be solved now , from the viewpoint of applications to magnetism , is to develop quantum , or at least semi - classical , theory of such structures .",
    "another question we want to mention here is the following one .",
    "it is a widely known fact that solitons appear as a result of joint action of nonlinearity and some other mechanisms , such as dispersion . in our consideration",
    "we have neglected the temporal dispersion ( temporal modulation ) , and its role has been played by the spatial one .",
    "so , it is interesting to take into account both temporal and spatial dispersions , because the competition of different mechanisms in nonlinear regime can lead to nontrivial results . these and some other related questions may be the subject of further investigations .",

    "we are grateful to a  s  kovalev for useful and stimulating discussions .",
    "the aim of this section is to derive the matrix @xmath116 related to the solution of equation ( [ main_eq ] ) @xmath91 by @xmath327 such that the matrices @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath328 have the structure of the alh matrices ( [ v - alh ] ) , ( [ w - alh ] ) .",
