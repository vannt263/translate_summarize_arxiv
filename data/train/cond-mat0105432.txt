    "the study of the magnetic ordering in geometrically frustrated antiferromagnets ( gfaf ) is not a new problem in condensed matter physics .",
    "it was initiated in the fifties by wannier , houtappel , and anderson@xcite .",
    "a further milestone was set by villain@xcite , who first argued that the pyrochlore heisenberg antiferromagnet remains paramagnetic down to 0 k. however , there has been a renewed interest during recent years on these lattices , mainly because , experimentally , a rich phenomenology has been found at low temperatures and novel phases have been identified , even though these systems are relatively simple crystals@xcite . in these materials ,",
    "the elementary unit of the magnetic structure is the triangle , which makes it impossible to satisfy all the antiferromagnetic bonds at the same time , with the result of a macroscopically degenerate ground state . among the lattices with the highest degree of frustration",
    "are the pyrochlore and kagome ones . in the former ,",
    "the magnetic ions occupy the corners of a 3d arrangement of corner sharing tetrahedra ; in the latter , the magnetic ions occupy the corners of a 2d arrangement of corner sharing triangles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.lattices ] ) . to summarize a very long story ,",
    "it is found that the susceptibility in materials belonging to this class exhibits a high temperature phase in which it follows the curie ",
    "weiss ( cw ) law .",
    "below the curie ",
    "weiss temperature , geometrical frustration inhibits the formation of a long range ordered ( lro ) state , and the system remains paramagnetic , even though there are strong correlations between units .",
    "this phase is universally present in these systems , and it is called the cooperative paramagnetic phase .",
    "finally , at a certain temperature , @xmath1 , which depends on the particular material and , usually , is well below the cw temperature , there appear non universal phases : some of the systems remain paramagnetic down to the lowest temperature reached experimentally@xcite , some of them exhibit non collinear ordered states@xcite , or even some of them form a spin glass state@xcite , even though the amount of disorder in the structure is very small .",
    "it is thus easy to understand the amount of theoretical attention these systems have generated@xcite .    in the simplest theoretical description of gfaf ,",
    "the spins on the lattice are regarded as heisenberg spins with only nearest neighbor ( nn ) interactions . in this picture",
    ", it is predicted that the non trivial degeneracy of the ground state inhibits the formation of a lro state , and the system remains paramagnetic down to zero temperature@xcite .",
    "however , due to the presence of frustration , the nn exchange does not fix an energy scale on the problem , and any small perturbation can break the non trivial degeneracy of the ground state and lead to some kind of ordered state .",
    "therefore , it is especially important to incorporate these possible perturbations in any model that tries to explain the low temperature phases of these systems .",
    "examples of perturbations present in real systems are next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) interactions , small anisotropies , long range dipole  dipole interaction , or dilution by non magnetic impurities , to cite some .    in a series of recent papers@xcite",
    ", the present authors have generalized the well known constant coupling method of magnetism@xcite , to deal with geometrically frustrated lattices , in both the classical and quantum cases , in the cooperative paramagnetic region .",
    "also , the connection between this technique and the so called phenomenological renormalization group ( rg ) methods for ising spins@xcite has been furnished in ref .  , where it was shown that the generalized constant coupling ( gcc ) method can be regarded as the zero - th order approximation of one of these rg techniques , for vectorial or scalar spin systems , the so called , mean field renormalization group method , when correlations outside a cluster are neglected , and the anomalous critical exponent of the system is taken to be zero .",
    "therefore , it is not so surprising that magnetic properties calculated within the framework of the classical gcc method were found to be in excellent agreement with monte carlo calculations for those same quantities@xcite , for both the kagome and pyrochlore lattices . the main idea behind this technique is very simple , and it is based in the experimental and numerical observation that correlations in gfaf are always short ranged@xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to calculate any thermodynamic quantity , we can start by calculating the partition function of an isolated cluster with @xmath2 spins and , later , add the interactions with the surrounding @xmath3 spins outside the cluster ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.lattices ] ) by means of an effective field which is fixed by a self - consistency condition .",
    "this , almost phenomenological , formulation of the method , allows one to easily compute thermodynamic quantities , mainly the susceptibility , in the paramagnetic region , by using a single effective field to characterize all the interactions with spins outside the cluster .",
    "however , it is not very useful to study the critical properties of these systems , except for ferromagnetic interactions , which is not as interesting as the antiferromagnetic case , due to the absence of geometrical frustration ( for heisenberg spins ) .",
    "the reason is very simple .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the ordered state of these gfaf , if any , is not a simple antiferromagnetic configuration , as in bipartite lattices , but a non - collinear ( nc ) one , in which the total spin momentum of the unit is identically zero@xcite .",
    "obviously , we can not characterize such an ordered state by using a single order parameter fixed by a single effective field ( ef ) .",
    "what is even worse , even we know that we have to introduce different order parameters for each of the spins in the cluster , and different ( ef ) for the neighboring spins outside the cluster , it is not easy to intuitively see how these ef enter into the expressions of the order parameters .",
    "therefore , we need to go beyond the phenomenological formulation of the gcc method introduced in the aforementioned works .",
    "this is precisely the intention of this work .",
    "we construct the gcc method from first principles , by using rigorous identities in terms of averages over finite size clusters . in this way",
    ", the ef naturally emerge as averages over the microscopic spin variables .",
    "this microscopic formulation of the gcc method not only allows us to recover all the results obtained refs .",
    "and in the paramagnetic regime but , also , gives us the possible ordered configurations of the system , and the conditions for a transition to one of these states to occur .",
    "moreover , as the gcc method is constructed in the real space , it is especially easy to include further perturbations in the system .",
    "particularly , we study the effect of next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) interactions and site dilution by non - magnetic impurities .    apart from the microscopic formulation of the gcc method itself , we present various interesting results in this work .",
    "we find the possible ordered configurations for systems formed by corner sharing units .",
    "these systems have the interesting property that the corresponding lattices are formed by units with @xmath4 spins ( @xmath5 the dimensionality ) , and each of the spins in the unit has @xmath3 nn outside the unit .",
    "thus , for @xmath6 , we have the pyrochlore lattice ; for @xmath7 , the kagome lattice , and for @xmath8 , the linear chain .",
    "we have studied this last case for the sake of completeness , even though this system is not frustrated .",
    "it is found that , apart from the trivial ferromagnetic configuration for ferromagnetic interactions , the ordered state would correspond to a non - collinear configuration given by the condition that the total magnetization of the unit is zero ( for the especial case of the linear chain this corresponds to standard antiferromagnetic order ) . for nn interactions only , there is no transition to such an ordered state at any finite temperature , for none of the systems considered , as it is now generally accepted@xcite .",
    "however , when nnn interactions are taken into account , there is a transition to such a nc ordered state for some ranges of the coupling parameters .",
    "we have only studied the pyrochlore lattice in this case , as we do not think the results of the present method for the critical behavior of these systems are reliable in dimension lower than 3 ( actually , the results of any model based on the idea of finite size clusters ) , as the long wavelength fluctuations around the nc ordered state are not properly taken into account , and they are very likely to be specially important in 2 dimensions ( kagome lattice ) .",
    "also , the effect of site dilution is considered in the present work .",
    "it is found that , in this framework , dilution by itself is not enough to stabilize a nc ordered state .",
    "finally , we also consider both dilution and nnn together , and the phase diagrams for different amounts of dilution are calculated .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows : in the following section , we introduce the systems studied in this work , the hamiltonian of these systems , the notation , and the self - consistency condition that fixes the ef . in section [ sec.order.parameters ]",
    "we present the calculation of the order parameters for finite cluster of size 1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath9 , and @xmath10 for the pyrochlore , kagome , and linear chain , respectively ) .",
    "the connection with the original formulation of the gcc method is furnished in section [ sec.connection ] . in section",
    "[ sec.critical ] we study the conditions for a transition to a long range ordered state . in section [ sec.nnn ]",
    "we include nnn interactions and study how this additional interaction modifies the conclusions of section [ sec.critical ] . in section [ sec.dilution ]",
    "we develop the formalism to deal with site dilution by non - magnetic impurities , and apply it to the present problem . in section [ sec.nnn.dilution ]",
    "we consider simultaneously the effect of both nnn interactions and site dilution .",
    "section [ sec.conclusions ] is devoted to the discussion of the results and the conclusions .",
    "finally , we have included two appendixes to clarify some of the most involved details of the evaluation of the partition function of the different clusters subject to inhomogeneous ef .",
    "as stated above , the original formulation of the gcc method@xcite is not well suited to study the critical behavior of gfaf .",
    "indeed , it is now generally accepted that the ground state of the pyrochlore and kagome lattices is fixed by the condition that the total spin momentum of the tetrahedral or triangular unit , respectively , is zero , though frustration inhibits the formation of such a state , and the system remains paramagnetic in the whole temperature range , if only nn interactions are present .",
    "obviously , we can not characterize such an ordered state with a single order parameter , as we did in refs .   and , which restricts the applicability of the gcc method to the study of the paramagnetic region or , at most , the ferromagnetic case , which is of less interest , due to the absence of geometrical frustration .",
    "a relatively simple way of circumventing this shortcoming of the method has been pointed out in refs .   and , and",
    "essentially consists on introducing different sublattices characterized by different order parameters .",
    "the minimum number of sublattices we need to introduce is given by the number of spins in the cluster , that is , 3 and 4 for the kagome and pyrochlore lattices , respectively ( see fig .  [ fig.lattices ] ) .",
    "with this subdivision , spins belonging to one sublattice only interact with spins belonging to different sublattices .",
    "therefore , the dimensionless heisenberg hamiltonian of a lattice formed by corner sharing clusters with @xmath2 spins , and only nn interactions , in the presence of a uniform magnetic field can be put in the form@xmath11 where @xmath12 are the classical heisenberg spins of unit length .",
    "the @xmath13 index labels the sublattice to which the considered spin belongs ( and takes the values @xmath14 ) , whereas the @xmath15 index labels the spins belonging to a given sublattice .",
    "@xmath16 ( @xmath17 for ferromagnetic interactions and @xmath18 for antiferromagnetic ones ) and @xmath19 with @xmath20 the applied magnetic field .",
    "the central idea of the gcc method is to calculate the order parameter ( for each sublattice ) for two clusters of different sizes , @xmath2 and @xmath21 , replacing the effect of the spins not included in the cluster by fixed effective fields , which act as a symmetry breaking field ( sbf ) and , by using the self - consistency condition@xmath22 obtain an equation to determine these effective fields and , thus , the magnetization .",
    "the order parameter is calculated by making use of the callen - suzuki identity@xcite@xmath23 where the partial trace is taken over the set of @xmath2 variables specified by the finite size cluster hamiltonian @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is the corresponding order parameter , and @xmath26 indicates the usual canonical thermal average over the ensemble defined by the complete hamiltonian @xmath27 .",
    "let us consider the cluster defined by the spin 1 in sublattice @xmath13 ( see fig .  [ fig.1spin.clusters ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of this cluster is given by@xmath28 where the subindex @xmath29 makes reference to the fact that the hamiltonian corresponds to a cluster of 1 spin belonging to sublattice @xmath13 , and @xmath30 stands for the symmetry breaking field acting on the spin of the 1-spin cluster , which belongs to sublattice @xmath13 .",
    "the sum over the @xmath15 index is performed over the nn of the @xmath29 spin , with @xmath31 the number of nn in each of the sublattices ( @xmath32 for both the kagome and pyrochlore lattices ) .    by using the callen  suzuki identity",
    "we can calculate the order parameter in sublattice @xmath13 for a cluster formed by 1 spin@xmath33 as commented above , @xmath34 represents the partial trace with respect to the variables of the spin @xmath29 , and the symbol @xmath26 stands for the usual canonical thermal average taken over the ensemble defined by the complete hamiltonian @xmath27 .",
    "this equation can be put in the more convenient form@xmath35 for classical vectorial spins of fixed length , the trace operation is given by@xmath36 where the integration is performed over the angular degrees of freedom of the spin .",
    "this integral is trivially evaluated to give@xmath37 and , taking into account the well known relation @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a unitary vector in the direction of @xmath40 , we can easily calculate the order parameter for the 1-spin cluster as@xmath41 where @xmath42 is the langevin function@xcite and @xmath43 is an unitary vector in the direction of the corresponding sbf .    near a critical point , as we expect the sbf to be very small , we can expand the previous expression and keep only linear terms in the sbf@xmath44 by defining the effective fields @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , we arrive to the final expression for the order parameter@xmath47 where we have taken into account that each spin has 2 nn on each sublattice different from the considered one .",
    "for example , for the pyrochlore lattice with no applied magnetic field we have @xmath48 where @xmath13 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 can take the values @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , or @xmath55 .",
    "for the kagome lattice@xmath56 where @xmath13 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 can take the values @xmath52 , @xmath53 , or @xmath54 . for a cluster with 2 spins",
    ", we have a linear chain , for which @xmath57 where @xmath13 and @xmath49 can take the values @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "another interesting point is that if we keep all the terms in the expansion of the order parameter , and make use of the decoupling approximation @xmath58 and further assume @xmath59 , we recover the usual self consistent curie ",
    "weiss equation for the order parameter@xmath60 however , this expression would predict a transition to an ordered state ( for antiferromagnetic interactions ) at a finite temperature given by @xmath61 , which it is well known to be incorrect for gfaf . that is one of the reasons why constructing the effective fields by the self - consistency condition",
    "provides a much better theory for gfaf , as we will see below .",
    "the calculation of the order parameter for a cluster with @xmath2 spins in the presence of the sbf created by the neighboring spins is a highly non - trivial problem , as we will see in the following .",
    "the size of the clusters is chosen so that we consider the smallest number of spins that include all the different sublattices .",
    "that is , @xmath63 for a kagome lattice ( a triangular cluster ) , @xmath64 for a pyrochlore ( a tetrahedral cluster ) , etc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.pspin.clusters ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a cluster can be put as@xmath65 in this hamiltonian , the first term represents the interaction between the spins inside the cluster of size @xmath2 , whereas the second term represents the interaction of those same spins with the symmetry breaking fields @xmath66 created by the @xmath3 spins outside the cluster .",
    "the sum over @xmath15 goes over all the nn spins except the ones already included in the cluster .",
    "the order parameter for each of the sublattices included in the cluster , obtained from the @xmath2-spin cluster can be now put as@xmath67 or , more conveniently@xmath68 in these expressions , @xmath69 represents the trace over the spin degrees of freedom in the @xmath2-spin cluster . the reduced trace operation for heisenberg spins",
    "is given by@xmath70 it is impossible to find a closed expression for this partition function of the cluster in the presence of inhomogeneous sbf ( the case with no sbf has been studied by moessner and berlinsky in ref .  ) .",
    "however , as we will be mainly interested in the region near the critical point ( if any ) in the absence of applied field , where the sbf are expected to be small , and in the paramagnetic region , where the sbf will be proportional to the applied field and , again , small , it is enough for our purposes to calculate reduced partition function up to second order in the sbf .",
    "the main steps of the calculation are presented in appendix [ appendix1 ] , and the result is given by @xmath71 for @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and@xmath74 expressions for these functions are given in appendix [ appendix2 ] . incidentally",
    ", the first term in corresponds to the partition function for non - interacting clusters with no applied field , which were first calculated by moessner and berlinsky@xcite .",
    "the additional terms in allow us to study not only the paramagnetic regime , but also the behavior of the system near a critical point , as we will see below .",
    "once we have this reduced partition function we can calculate the order parameter up to first order in the sbf by taking into account @xmath75 taking into account the definition of the sbf , and the fact that @xmath76 , after a little algebra we arrive at@xmath77 \\vec{h}_{0}+\\left ( 1-(p-2)a_{p}(k)\\right ) \\sum _ { \\beta \\neq \\alpha } \\vec{h}'_{\\beta } -(p-1)a_{p}(k)\\vec{h}'_{\\alpha } \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where we have introduced the function@xmath78",

    "in the absence of applied field , the system of equations takes the simpler form@xmath93 \\sum _ { \\beta \\neq \\alpha } \\vec{h}'_{\\beta } = \\vec{0},\\ ] ] and it has two different non - trivial solutions .",
    "the first one occurs if @xmath94 or , equivalently,@xmath95 and corresponds to an ordered state in which@xmath96 we will call this kind of state a non - collinear ( nc ) ordered state .",
    "actually , this condition includes , as particular cases , states in which spins in different sublattices are antiferromagnetically aligned with each other , that is , collinear states . however , the most general state described by this condition is a non - collinear one .",
    "the second solution of occurs if @xmath97 or , equivalently , @xmath98 and corresponds to an ordered state in which @xmath99 that is , ferromagnetic order .",
    "the previous condition for the existence at any finite temperature of a ferromagnetic ordered state is equivalent to studying if the function @xmath100 changes its sign for any finite value of @xmath101 .",
    "this function has been depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.ferro ] for the pyrochlore lattice , kagome lattice , and linear chain .",
    "we can see that the present method correctly predicts the existence of a transition for the pyrochlore lattice for a value finite value of @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) , and no finite @xmath103 transition for the linear chain , but incorrectly predicts a transition for the kagome lattice ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the long wavelength fluctuations around the ferromagnetic state are not taken into account in the present method , and these fluctuations destroy the ordered state in 2 dimensions . on the other hand , in the linear chain case ,",
    "even short range correlations , properly described in the model , are enough to destroy any form of long range order .",
    "the condition for the existence of a non - collinear ordered state is equivalent to study if the function @xmath105 changes its sign for any finite value of @xmath101 .",
    "this function has been depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.noncollinear ] .",
    "we can see that the model correctly predicts that there is no transition to an ordered state for any of the systems considered .    for comparison",
    ", we have also applied the present gcc method to the heisenberg model with nn interactions on a simple cubic ( s.c . ) lattice . in the framework of the cw theory ,",
    "it is predicted that both the s.c . and",
    "the pyrochlore lattices should have the same transition temperature to a lro state , as they have the same number of nn .",
    "for the s.c . , it is enough , for our purposes , to consider 2 different sublattices .",
    "each spin in one sublattice has 6 nn in the other sublattice .",
    "once we take into account this difference with respect to the pyrochlore lattice ( which has @xmath3 nn , as mentioned above ) , we obtain that , for ferromagnetic nn interactions , there is a transition to a ferromagnetic state for @xmath106 , to be compared with more refined estimates of this quantity from high - precision mc calculations@xcite , @xmath107 .",
    "for antiferromagnetic interactions , a transition to an antiferromagnetic ( af ) state occurs at @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , we can see that the present method is able to distinguish between the different topologies of the lattices , even when they have the same number of nn .",
    "furthermore , the estimation of the critical point for the s.c . is very good ( up to ~10% ) , even though we have considered the smallest possible cluster that can describe the af ordered state of the s.c .",
    "lattice .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , one consequence of the presence of geometrical frustration in the system is that the nn exchange does not define an energy scale in the problem .",
    "therefore , any perturbation is a strong perturbation , and can break the non - trivial degeneracy of the ground state , selecting one ordered state . in the following sections",
    ", we will study if nnn interactions and site dilution by non - magnetic impurities , which are always present in real systems , really break this non - trivial degeneracy , that is , if these effects are able to select an ordered state at finite temperature .",

    ", nnn interactions can stabilize different ordered states depending on the value of @xmath123 and the sign of the nn interaction . for antiferromagnetic nn interactions and @xmath126 ,",
    "the system remains paramagnetic down to 0 k. for antiferromagnetic nn and nnn interactions , a nc ordered estate is selected at finite temperature for @xmath127 .",

    "in fact , in order to treat this problem consistently , we should include new sublattices such as spins in one sublattice do not interact with spins on the same sublattice .",
    "in doing so , it can happen that new kinds of ordered states arise@xcite .",
    "however , our main intention here is to check if the nc state given by is selected by nnn interactions .",
    "the general problem with more sublattices will be studied elsewhere .",
    "in order to study the effect of site dilution on the susceptibility and on the conditions for the appearance of an ordered state , we need to average both the sbf and the order parameters over the distribution of non - magnetic impurities . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that the distribution of non - magnetic impurities is purely random . under this condition ,",
    "the number of units with @xmath132 spins , for a lattice which , in the absence of dilution , is formed by units with @xmath2 spins , for a concentration of non - magnetic impurities @xmath133 , is given by@xcite@xmath134 however , this distribution is normalized with respect to units , whereas we need a distribution function normalized with respect to a single spin .",

    "in this work we have presented a microscopic formulation of the generalized constant coupling method for geometrically frustrated magnets . by introducing different bravais sublattices characterized by different order parameters we are able to describe more general kinds of long range ordered states , including non - collinear ones .",
    "these order parameters are evaluated by making use of the suzuki - callen identity for finite size clusters , in terms of symmetry breaking fields arising from interactions with units surrounding the considered one .",
    "the symmetry breaking fields are easily related with the phenomenological effective fields introduced in the original formulation of the generalized constant coupling method , in terms of averages over the neighboring spin variables outside the unit , and they are fixed by a self - consistency condition . though we have not stressed this point , this self - consistency condition is , in fact , a particular case of the more general scaling hypothesis between the order parameters for finite clusters of different sizes@xcite .    when a magnetic field is applied to the system",
    ", this method allows us to easily compute the susceptibility , and we recover previous results obtained in the phenomenological formulation of the gcc method , which were shown to be in excellent agreement with mc results for both the kagome and pyrochlore lattice .",
    "however , the present formulation , allows us to also study the critical behavior of the system when no applied magnetic field is present .",
    "the possible ordered configurations for these systems naturally arise from the equations that fix the order parameters . in completely agreement with the accepted idea , for ferromagnetic interactions a ferromagnetic configuration in which all the spins point along the same direction is found . for antiferromagnetic interactions , a non - collinear state in which the total magnetization of each cluster is identically zero",
    "also , the conditions for the formation of such ordered states arise from the calculation .",
    "it is found that , for nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions , frustration inhibits the formation of a long range ordered state , and the system remains paramagnetic down to 0 k. we have briefly compared the results for these frustrated geometries with the results for a simple cubic lattice obtained with this same method , and we found that the generalized constant coupling method correctly distinguishes between different topologies of the lattice , even in case where the number of nearest neighbors is the same , as it happens with the pyrochlore and cubic lattices .",
    "another advantage of the present formulation is that it is constructed in the real space , which makes it very easy to include additional perturbations to the system , by modifying the form of the symmetry breaking fields .",
    "particularly , we have studied the effect of next nearest neighbor interactions and site dilution by non - magnetic impurities for the pyrochlore lattice . in the former case , the phase diagram has been calculated .",
    "it is found that , for certain values of the ratio @xmath113 , a non - collinear or ferromagnetic ordered state can be stabilized . however , the minimum value of @xmath123 above which a non - collinear configuration is estable seems to be too large to explain the formation of long range order found in some systems , notably in gd@xmath183ti@xmath183o@xmath184@xcite .",
    "moreover , it seems clear from neutron scattering that the ordered configuration in this case is not compatible with the condition that the total magnetization of the tetrahedral cluster is zero@xcite .",
    "however , the main perturbation in this system seems to come from long range dipolar interactions , which are highly anysotropic . further theoretical work in this direction , in the present framework , is still necessary .    regarding the effects of site dilution",
    ", it has been argued that this kind of effect , always present in real materials , could break the non - trivial degeneracy of the ground state and cause a transition to some kind of long range ordered state at finite temperature .",
    "however , in our calculation , we find that this is not case : site dilution by itself does not induce a transition , for any amount of dilution .",
    "it is necessary to include simultaneously both dilution and next nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "a word of caution must be said here , however . in the last part of this work ,",
    "we have focused our attention on studying if a non - collinear ordered state given by the rule that the total magnetization of the tetrahedral unit is zero is estabilized by any of these perturbations . however , these are not the only possible ordered configurations when we include these effects . for example ,",
    "reimers and coworkers@xcite showed that , in the framework of mean field theory , next nearest neighbor interactions can induce both non - collinear ordered states as the ones studied in this work , or ordered states characterized by an inconmensurate wave vector .",
    "it is not easy to describe these inconmesurate states with a real space method , and it could be the case that site dilution would lead to such an inconmesurate state . therefore , more theoretical work in that direction should be necesary before ruling out the possibility of a long range ordered state induced by small amounts of site dilution or , what would be even more interesting , the possibility of a transition to some kind of spin glass state induced by dilution@xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the formulation of the generalized constant coupling method presented in this work provides us a conceptual framework in which both thermodynamic quantities and the critical behavior of geometrically frustrated magnets can be properly described",
    ". the method can be easily generalized to deal with further perturbations always present in real systems .",
    "we have presented the classical limit of the method . however , in order to compare the calculated quantities with experimental data for these systems , the corresponding quantum generalized constant coupling method should be used .",
    "this issue , the occurrence of inconmensurate states due to dilution , and the effect of the inclusion of long range dipolar interactions in the hamiltonian are open issues which deserve further theoretical work .",
    "in this appendix we present the main step for the evaluation of the integral @xmath185 which can be put in the more convenient form@xmath186 by using the fourier transform representation of the dirac-@xmath51@xmath187 we can further put@xmath188 where we have introduced the vector @xmath189 , and made use of the fact@xmath190 with @xmath191 the total spin of the unit , up to an unimportant global constant in the hamiltonian .",
    "the integral over @xmath192 can be done as follows .",
    "taking into account@xmath193 where we have assumed that the length of @xmath192 is 1 ( this can be always done by redefining @xmath194 with @xmath195 the length of the spin ) , the integral over @xmath192 can be put as + @xmath196 where @xmath197 ( we have factored out a ( -1 ) in the definition of @xmath198 ) .",
    "next , we can do the integral over @xmath191 @xmath199 which only converges for @xmath18 , and we are left with an integral over @xmath200@xmath201 which can not be calculated in a closed form . an interesting point here",
    "is that , if we take @xmath202 , we recover the partition function calculated in the original gcc model .",
    "the only thing we can do at this point is to expand the partition function in powers of the sbf , up to second order , as the rest of terms will be assumed to be small near the critical point once we take the thermal average . with a little algebra",
