    "closeness of the @xmath0 to the @xmath11 and @xmath12 thresholds and existence of other scalar meson @xmath13 at a very similar mass make possible an isospin mixing of both resonant states .",

    "let us briefly describe our theoretical model @xcite .",
    "we consider two channels @xmath2 ( label 1 ) and @xmath3 ( label 2 ) .",

    "matrix elements in the following way : @xmath49    the matrix of potentials has five parameters : two @xmath25 and three independent @xmath50 parameters , which must be determined from data . in a case",
    "when masses and widths of two @xmath8 resonances are known a calculation of four parameters is rather simple .",
    "the positions of resonances in the complex energy plane coincide with poles of the s ",
    "matrix elements and with zeroes of the jost function @xmath51 .",
    "thus four model parameters can be found by solving two complex equations : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the complex momenta in a channel @xmath55 related to the complex energy positions of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances , respectively .",
    "there exists an ambiguity in determination of the momenta since a given resonance energy @xmath56 ( @xmath57 being a resonance mass and @xmath58 its width ) can correspond to more than one resonance position in the complex plane of two momenta @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the energy conservation relation is quadratic in momenta , thus resonances can be situated on different sheets labelled by signs of imaginary parts @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "similar results with very different widths can be found for solution b obtained in @xcite by the crystal barrel collaboration .",

    "we should point out that some numbers in do not coincide with the pole positions written in @xcite ( also the sheet numbers seem to be interchanged ) .    the original flatt parametrisation has been used by the e852 collaboration in the study of the reaction @xmath75 measured at brookhaven at 18.3 gev / c @xcite .",
    "the e852 group has performed a fit of the observed @xmath76 effective mass distribution and obtained the mass position @xmath77 mev , the ratio of coupling constants @xmath78 and the value of dimensionless coupling constant @xmath79 , corresponding to the @xmath80 width @xmath81 mev calculated at the @xmath82 position .",
    "after an effective mass correction for a finite experimental resolution this value was reduced to @xmath83 mev @xcite which is equivalent to a reduction of the @xmath80 coupling constant to @xmath84 . using this value of @xmath85 and the above numbers of @xmath82 and @xmath86 we have found positions of two poles at @xmath87 these positions are in very good agreement with those calculated by us for the crystal barrel collaboration parameters in .",
    "let us remark that the parameters of the @xmath0 meson cited in table ii @xcite in the line labelled by e852(c ) do not correspond to the pole position of the production amplitude , so @xmath82 and @xmath58 placed in that line should not be interpreted as the @xmath0 resonance mass and its width .",
    "the presence of two distinct poles related to the @xmath0 meson means that in principle one has two options while fixing the model parameters using eq . .",
    "at first we shall discuss the case when the @xmath0 pole is located on sheet ii at @xmath88 mev .",

    "this interference is particularly important in the @xmath3 channel so the integration over the @xmath3 invariant masses higher than @xmath102  gev would lead to a significant distortion of the @xmath0 branching ratio .    the variation of the branching ratio with @xmath91 is correlated with the dependence of the interchannel coupling constant @xmath103 on @xmath91 .",
    "maximum of @xmath104 lies for @xmath91 near @xmath105 gev .",
    "the particle data group @xcite has calculated an average branching ratio from the results obtained by the crystal barrel collaboration@xcite ( @xmath106 ) and by the wa102 group @xcite ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "however , this procedure has to be taken with a great care since the value of br depends very much on the integral limits . for the @xmath5 annihilation at rest into @xmath108 the available @xmath2 effective mass varies between 682 mev at the @xmath109 threshold and the maximum value of about 1741 mev .",
    "the wa102 collaboration has studied the reaction @xmath110 with a subsequent decay of @xmath111 into the @xmath112 system .",
    "then the maximum of the @xmath2 effective mass equals to about 1147 mev .",
    "we have recalculated the crystal barrel result @xmath113 , corresponding to @xmath114 mev , by lowering the upper limit to @xmath115 mev .",
    "then the number @xmath116 was quite close to the wa102 result cited above . encouraged by this agreement we have made calculations restricting @xmath95 limit to values closer to the @xmath3 threshold where the @xmath0 resonance dominates .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : br ] by points with errors corresponding to the crystal barrel error @xmath117 .",
    "a comparison with the theoretical curves following from our model indicates that the @xmath91 value should be chosen close to 20 gev .",
    "then the complete set of the potential parameters corresponding to the @xmath0 lying on sheet ii and the @xmath1 located on sheet iii is following : @xmath118",
    "having established all the model parameters we can predict the @xmath3/@xmath2 branching ratio in the @xmath1 mass range .",
    "one can take equal limits @xmath119 and the @xmath1 width @xmath90 mev @xcite . for a typical range of @xmath65 between @xmath120 and @xmath121",
    "the branching ratio equals to @xmath122 .",

    "the crystal barrel collaboration result @xcite @xmath125 agrees quite well with both theoretical numbers following from our model .",
    "thus there is a mutual consistency of two branching ratios calculated within our model for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons and the experimental numbers obtained by the crystal barrel collaboration .",
    "let us discuss for a moment the case when the @xmath0 pole is fixed on sheet iii at @xmath126 mev ( see eq . ) .",
    "if we calculate the branching ratio br as in fig .",
    "[ fig : br ] then the theoretical curves lie substantially lower ( by a factor at least 2.5 ) than the recalculated experimental values . thus in the following text",
    "this case will not be considered .",
    "we have also studied a dependence of the @xmath0 branching ratio on the input values of the @xmath1 mass and width .",
    "let us recall that the obelix collaboration has observed the @xmath127 resonance at @xmath128 mev and @xmath129 mev @xcite . branching ratio as @xmath130 @xcite in agreement with the crystal barrel collaboration ratio @xmath113 . ]",
    "if in our model we take the above values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 instead of @xmath89 mev and @xmath90 mev then the resulting @xmath0 branching ratio is too small by a factor at least 3 for both positions of @xmath0 in when it is compared with numbers represented by experimental points in fig .",
    "[ fig : br ] .",
    "even if the @xmath0 mass would be lowered to 975 mev as given in @xcite then the @xmath0 branching ratio should be even smaller . hence we have found that , using our two channel model , it is difficult to link the parameters of the @xmath0 and the @xmath127 resonances obtained by the obelix collaboration .      the relations between the jost function and the s ",

    "the same remark is true for the poles 3 and 4 corresponding to the @xmath1 .",

    "[ fig : traj ] ) .",
    "one can notice that in the limit @xmath136 two poles 3 and 4 meet together in the complex plane of @xmath45 momentum which means that in the uncoupled @xmath3 channel there exist a @xmath3 resonance at the effective mass equal to ( @xmath137 ) mev .",
    "this @xmath3 resonance evolves into the @xmath1 when the coupling between channels is switched on .",

    "thus effectively both poles 1 and 2 disappear from the @xmath3 channel in the limit of the vanishing interchannel coupling constant . in the @xmath2 channel",
    "the poles 1 and 2 meet together in this limit at one point , so for the parameter set the @xmath0 state has its origin in the @xmath2 channel as a resonance at the effective mass ( @xmath140 ) mev .",
    "in such a way one can show that although the @xmath3 forces in the @xmath4 s  wave are attractive ( @xmath141 in ) they are not sufficiently strong to form a bound @xmath3 state .",
    "this information about the nature of the @xmath0 meson can be confronted with the results obtained in literature on two close scalars @xmath13 and @xmath0 . in @xcite",
    "one can find different solutions for the @xmath142 , @xmath3 and @xmath143 amplitudes fitted to the same experimental data .",
    "however , the data near the @xmath3 threshold are not yet precise enough to state whether the attractive @xmath3 forces in the isoscalar s  wave can always create a bound @xmath13 state coupling constants of the @xmath13 are much larger than the @xmath3 constants of the @xmath0 .",
    "they can attain values close to @xmath144 in comparison with values below @xmath145 shown in table [ tab : coupling ] . ] .",
    "this result is at variance with a statement of weinstein and isgur @xcite that both @xmath13 and @xmath0 are the bound @xmath3 states .",
    "we agree , however , with the conclusion of janssen , pearce , holinde and speth @xcite that the @xmath0 meson is not a bound @xmath3 state .",
    "we have studied to what extend the conclusion about nonexistence of the @xmath3 bound state in the isovector s  wave remains valid in the limit of vanishing coupling constant between @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels while simultaneously the input parameters like the masses and the widths of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are modified .",
    "we have checked that this is true if the @xmath0 mass on sheet ii changes between 950 mev and 1020 mev , its width varies between 25 and 100 mev , the @xmath1 mass on sheet iii changes between 1300 mev and 1550 mev and its width varies between 150 mev and 350 mev . in order to check possible large systematic errors of the input and to verify that the conclusion is firm the above limits are chosen larger than the errors of the @xmath8 resonance parameters given by the particle data group .",
    "in summary , we have constructed the coupled channel model of two @xmath8 resonances decaying into the @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "the parameters of the separable potentials have been fitted to experimental values of the @xmath8 masses and widths and to the @xmath3/@xmath2 branching ratio near the @xmath3 threshold .",
