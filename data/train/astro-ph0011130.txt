    "the solar neutrino problem is so important that any aspect of solar , plasma and nuclear physics pertinent to it has to be deeply investigated before definitive conclusions can be drawn . in this respect ,",
    "screening of the charges of the reacting nuclei due to free charges in the solar plasma is of some interest .",
    "the study of screened nuclear reaction rates was started with the pioneering work of salpeter @xcite , who discussed both the extreme cases of `` weak '' and `` strong '' screening , providing suitable expressions for the screening factors @xmath0 the solar core is not far from the weak screening case , however it does not satisfy the usual conditions under which the weak screening approximation holds .",
    "this is the reason why the problem has been investigated by several authors , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "gruzinov and bahcall @xcite calculated the electron density in the vicinity of fusing nuclei using the partial differential equation for the density matrix that is derived in quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "their numerical result agrees , within small uncertainties , with salpeter s weak screening formula .",
    "furthermore , bahcall et al .",
    "@xcite recently provided several arguments that demonstrate the validity of the salpeter formula near the solar center with insignificant errors .",
    "the conclusions of gruzinov and bahcall @xcite are not unanimously accepted . according to shaviv and shaviv @xcite",
    ", the weak screening formula does not hold in the sun .",
    "some nuclear reactions are enhanched by the surrounding plasma whereas some others are suppressed .",
    "according to tsytovitch and bornatici @xcite a kinetic description of collective plasma effects results in a decrease of the thermonuclear reaction rates in contrast to the salpeter s enhancement .",
    "we observe that solar models are built by using stellar evolutionary codes which include specific expressions for the the nuclear reaction rates .",
    "if one uses different formulas for the screening factors @xmath1 one obtains different solar models . on the other hand , helioseismology provides precise information on the sound speed profile and on the properties of the convective envelope , see e.g. @xcite , which have to be reproduced by the correct solar model .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to test the screening models by means of helioseismology .",
    "we build several solar models corresponding to different screening factors and compare the results with helioseismic data",
    ".    we also comment on the predicted neutrino fluxes .",
    "many of the attempts to modify the screening factors have been produced as an effort to avoid or mitigate the so called solar neutrino puzzle , by reducing the predicted @xmath2 neutrino flux .",
    "we will show that a reduction of the screening factors does not generally imply a reduction of the @xmath2 neutrino flux .",
    "by using franec @xcite , a stellar evolutionary code including diffusion of helium and heavy elements @xcite , we constructed solar models based on four different assumptions :    \\i ) the weak screening approximation ( wes ) .",
    "the screening factors @xmath1 are given by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the charges of the interacting nuclei , @xmath5 is the temperature and @xmath6 is the debye radius . as clear from equation above ,",
    "the screening factors are always larger than unity , i.e. the plasma provides enhancement of the thermonuclear reaction rates .",
    "\\ii ) the mitler result @xcite ( mit ) , obtained with an analytical method which goes beyond the linearized approach and which correctly reproduces both the limits of weak and strong screening .",
    "neglecting the small effects of a radial dependence in the effective potential , see @xcite , the enhancement factors are given now by : @xmath7/ ( k t)\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the electron number density .",
    "\\iii ) neglect completely any screening effect ( nos ) , i.e. nuclear reactions occur with rates @xmath10 .",
    "this case is considered in connection with the suggestions that screening can be much smaller than salpeter s estimate , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "\\iv ) the tsytovich model ( tsy ) @xcite , which provides a decrease of all the thermonuclear reaction rates with respect to the case of bare nuclei .",
    "screening factors are taken from table 1b of ref .",
    "@xcite and , for the @xmath11 electron capture , from table 2 of the same reference ( all factors are assumed constant along the solar profile ) .    in table [ tabf ] we report the screening factors at the solar center for the various models .",
    "one sees that the weak screening approximation always yields the largest enhancement factors , as physically clear due to the fact that electrons and ions are assumed to be free and capable of following the reacting nuclei .",
    "we also remind that in this model the electron cloud is allowed to strongly condense around the nuclei . in the mitler model , where electron density at the nuclear site is fixed at @xmath9 ,",
    "the enhancement factor is smaller . by definition",
    "there is no enhancement in the nos model , whereas in tsy model there is a decrease of the reaction rate , as already remarked .",
    "the main features of the solar models we obtained are presented in table [ tabmod ] . when moving from wes to solar models where nuclear reactions are less favoured one observes the following effects :    \\i ) the central temperature @xmath12 increases .",
    "in fact the hydrogen burning rate is fixed by the solar luminosity and a decrease of @xmath13 has to be compensated with a temperature increase ;    \\ii ) the isothermal sound speed , @xmath14 near the center increases .",
    "this is due to the increase of temperature whereas the `` mean molecular weight '' remains approximately constant ;    \\iii ) the properties of the convective envelope are affected .",
    "in particular the border between the radiative and the convective region moves outwards and the photospheric helium abundance decreases .",
    "as well known several properties of the sun can be determined accurately by helioseismic data , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the photospheric helium abundance @xmath15 and the depth of the convective zone @xmath16 are given by : @xmath17 @xmath18 the quoted errors are the so called `` statistical '' or `` @xmath19 '' errors of @xcite .",
    "this error estimate was obtained by adding in quadrature each contribution to the uncertainty .",
    "similar error estimates are given in @xcite .",
    "a more conservative approach corresponds to add linearly all known individual uncertainties .",
    "this gives the so called `` conservative '' errors studied in @xcite , which are about a factor three larger than those in eqs .",
    "( [ eqyph],[eqrb ] ) .",
    "moreover , by inversion of helioseismic data one can determine the sound speed profile in the solar interior .",
    "this analysis can be performed either in terms of the isothermal squared sound speed , @xmath14 , or in terms of the adiabatic squared sound speed @xmath20 , as the coefficient @xmath21 is extremely well determined by the equation of state of the stellar plasma .",
    "the typical `` @xmath19 '' error on @xmath22 is about @xmath23 in the intermediate solar region and increases up to @xmath24 near the solar center , see @xcite .",
    "a similar error estimate is obtained in @xcite .",
    "the `` conservative '' error estimate of ref @xcite is about a factor three larger .",
    "recent standard solar models calculated by using the weak screening prescription are in agreement with helioseismic constraints on the properties of the convective envelope and on the sound speed profile , see e.g. the bp98 model of ref @xcite and bp2000 model of ref @xcite . as an example",
    ", we present in fig .",
    "[ figubp98 ] .",
    "the comparison between the prediction of bp2000 and helioseismic data for @xmath25 .",
    "all this shows that the weak screening model is in agreeement with data and deviations from wes can not be too large . from the comparison of different models ,",
    "see table [ tabmod ] and fig [ figu ] , one obtain the following results :    \\i ) the difference between the tsytovitch model ( tsy ) and the weak screening model ( wes ) exceeds the  conservative \" uncertainty on @xmath22 in a significant portion of the solar profile .",
    "we remark that also the depth of the convective envelope is significantly altered . in other words the anti - screening predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite can be excluded by means of helioseismology .",
    "\\ii ) also the difference between the no - screening model ( nos ) and wes is significant for both @xmath22 and @xmath16 in comparison with helioseismic uncertainty . in other words",
    "the existence of a screening effect can be proved by means of helioseismology .",
    "\\iii ) the mitler model of screening ( mit ) can not be distinguished from the weak screening model within the present accuracy of helioseismology .",
    "a reduction of the screening factors does not automatically mitigate the `` solar neutrino problem '' .",
    "as an example the tsy model predicts a larger @xmath2 flux , chlorine and gallium signals than the wes model , see last column of tab .",
    "[ tabmod ] .",
    "as discussed extensively in ref @xcite , the behaviour of neutrino fluxes can be understood by considering that a decrease of the screening factors has the following effects on the solar structure :    \\i ) the hydrogen burning rate is fixed by the solar luminosity and a decrease of @xmath13 has to be compensated with a temperature increase , being approximatively @xcite : @xmath26 ii ) the rate of the @xmath27 reaction , which is responsible for the pp - ii chain and for beryllium neutrino production , is changed .",
    "this results both from the increase in central temperature and from the variations in the screening factors @xmath28 and @xmath29 , see @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "one expects a variation in the beryllium neutrino flux given by : @xmath30 iii ) the @xmath2 neutrino flux in addition depends on the ratio of the proton to electron capture rates on @xmath11 : @xmath31    these scaling laws account for the numerical results of table [ tabmod ] and provide an explanation for the @xmath2 neutrino flux increase of the tsy model . as clear from eq.([boro ] ) effects on the proton and electron capture almost compensate ( @xmath32 ) , and the increase is essentially due to the @xmath33 term , which corresponds to the temperature effect .",
    "we recall here the main points of our discussion :      \\ii ) we find that the a no - screening solar model is not completely consistent with helioseismic data on @xmath22 and @xmath16 , in other words the existence of a screening effect can be proved by means of helioseismology ."
