    "dynamic and equilibrium properties of lattice gases , i.e. systems involving randomly moving particles with hard - core interactions , have received much interest within the last several decades .",
    "a number of important theoretical results have been obtained for such systems revealing non - trivial , many - body behavior @xcite .",
    "lattice gas models often serve as microscopic models of complex physical phenomena . to name a few we mention dynamics of motor proteins @xcite , growth of interfaces @xcite , traffic jams and queuing problems @xcite .",
    "a lattice - gas approach has been used for the derivation of euler - type hydrodynamic equations , e.g. the burgers equation @xcite .",
    "another important example concerns the spreading of molecularly thin wetting films , where experimental studies @xcite have evidenced surprising universal laws which recently have been explained in terms of a lattice gas model @xcite .",
    "we believe also that a robust microscopic , molecular approach to such physical phenomena as shear - induced ordering in colloidal suspensions @xcite or stick - slip motion of mica planes separated by an ultrathin liquid layer @xcite could also begin with a description based on a lattice - gas picture .    at present time",
    "two models are well - studied in the literature . in the first , the so - called asymmetric exclusion process",
    ", all particles in the system perform stochastic motion , constrained by hard - core interactions , in the field of a constant driving force @xcite . here",
    "the velocity , diffusion constant and equilibrium configurations have been calculated exactly for different types of boundary conditions ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in the second , no external force is present and all particles have symmetric transition rates .",
    "remarkably , in such a situation , the motion of a labeled , tracer particle is non - diffusive in low dimensions .",
    "for example , the mean - square displacement @xmath5 of a tracer particle ( identical except for its observability to all other particles ) in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) symmetric lattice gas shows a sublinear growth with time @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , denotes the mean ( constant ) concentration of vacant sites and the argument @xmath9 signifies that the external force is absent and that all particles have symmetric transition rates .",
    "hence , in 1d trajectories @xmath10 of such a tracer particle are more compact than these of particles without the hard - core constraints . in 2d",
    "the mean - square displacement @xmath5 shows a linear dependence on time with additional logarithmic terms @xcite ; in 3d it grows linearly in time with the diffusion constant being a nontrivial function of the particle concentration .    in the present paper we focus on",
    "the less studied and less understood situation in which only one particle ( the tracer ) experiences the action of an external ( constant ) driving force , @xmath0 and thus has asymmetric transition rates , while all other particles ( bath particles ) are not subject to this force and have symmetric transition rates .",
    "the tracer behavior in such a system with a vanishingly small driving force has been first examined in @xcite in which the question of the validity of the einstein relation for the hard - core lattice gases has been addressed .",
    "such a model has been used @xcite in a numerical study of the gravity driven motion of a finite rigid rod in a ",
    "sea  of hard - core monomers .",
    "another physical example corresponds to the situation in which a charged particle diffuses in a lattice gas of electrically neutral particles in the presence of a constant electric field @xmath0 .",
    "the extreme case of infinitely strong electric fields ( @xmath11 ) , which means that the tracer particle may move only in one direction , has been studied in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , for example , that in 1d systems the mean displacement , @xmath12 , of a charged tracer particle grows sub linearly with time ,    @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a constant @xcite .",
    "eq.(2 ) indicates that hard - core interactions give rise to an effective friction .",
    "in the one - dimensional case this force is much stronger than the viscous friction for one particle and grows in proportion to the mean displacement of the tracer , i.e. as @xmath15 , as this is a measure of the size of the compressed region preceding the tracer which hinders the ballistic motion of the driven particle .    here",
    "we study motion of a driven tracer particle in a symmetric lattice gas in the general case of fields of arbitrary strength and at arbitrary concentrations of the lattice - gas particles .",
    "focusing on one - dimensional situations in which the hindering effect of the lattice - gas ( bath ) particles on the tracer motion is most pronounced , we devise a mean - field - type theory which allows simple calculation of the mean displacement of the tracer particle as a function of time and other pertinent parameters .",
    "we find that @xmath16 has the following dependence    @xmath17 where the parameter @xmath18 is a time - independent constant , which is a complicated function of field strength @xmath19 which determines the transition probabilities @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and concentration of the bath particles , @xmath22 .",
    "this constant is determined here for arbitrary values of @xmath0 and @xmath23 .",
    "our analytical findings are in excellent agreement with the results of numerical simulations .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we describe the model . in section 3",
    "we present definitions and write down basic equations describing motion of particles . in section 4",
    "we determine explicitly the growth law for the mean displacement of the tracer particle , eq.(3 ) , and evaluate a closed transcendental equation for the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "in several limiting cases the dependence of @xmath18 on the pertinent parameters is explicitly obtained .",
    "section 5 presents results of numerical simulations and comparison of these with our analytical predictions .",
    "finally , in section 6 we conclude with summary of our results and discussion .",
    "the model is defined in the following way . consider a one - dimensional regular lattice of unit spacing , infinite in both directions , the sites @xmath24 of which are either singly occupied by identical particles or vacant .",
    "the particles are initially placed at random ( constrained by the condition that double occupancy of sites is forbidden ) with mean concentration @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mean site occupancy , @xmath27 being the mean site vacancy .",
    "the tracer particle is put initially at the origin , i.e. at @xmath28 .",
    "a configuration of the system is characterized by an infinite set of ( time - dependent ) occupation variables @xmath29 , where @xmath30 if site @xmath31 is occupied and @xmath32 if site @xmath31 is vacant .",
    "consequently , the variable @xmath33 describes the probability that site @xmath31 is vacant .",
    "the dynamics of the bath particles is symmetric : each particle waits a ( random ) exponentially distributed time with mean @xmath34 and then attempts to jump , with equal probability @xmath35 to the right or left neighboring site .",
    "the jump actually occurs if the chosen site is empty .",
    "the tracer particle motion is asymmetric : the tracer waits a random exponentially distributed time with mean @xmath34 and then randomly selects a jump direction .",
    "it chooses right - hand ( left - hand ) adjacent site with probability @xmath20 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the jump occurs if the selected site is vacant .",
    "if the asymmetry in tracer jump probabilities is due to an external electric field , @xmath0 , one has the relation @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the inverse temperature . for simplicity",
    "we have set the tracer charge to unity .",
    "we also assume , without lack of generality , that @xmath0 is oriented in the positive direction , i.e. @xmath39 , and thus @xmath40 .",
    "we start by writing the equations which describe dynamics of the tracer particle .",
    "let @xmath41 denote the position of the tracer at time @xmath2 ( by definition @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 be the probability that the tracer is at site @xmath31 at time @xmath2 .",
    "the mean displacement of the tracer particle , i.e. @xmath16 , is then defined as    @xmath44    the time evolution of @xmath43 is governed by the equation    @xmath45 @xmath46 where the dot denotes the time derivative .",
    "the first two terms on the r - h - s of eq.(4 ) describe respectively the change in @xmath43 due to jumps of the tracer particle from the site @xmath31 to sites @xmath47 , while the third and fourth terms account for jumps from the sites @xmath47 to the site @xmath31 .",
    "multiplying both sides of eq.(4 ) by @xmath31 and summing over all lattice sites we arrive at the rate equation    @xmath48 where    @xmath49 is the pairwise tracer - vacancy correlation function , which can be thought off as the probability of finding at time @xmath2 a vacancy at the distance @xmath50 from the tracer .",
    "the correlation function is defined in the frame of reference moving with the tracer and jumps of the tracer change the value of @xmath51 .",
    "consider now evolution of @xmath51 , which completely determines the mean displacement of the tracer , eq.(5 ) .",
    "the change in @xmath51 results from two different processes    @xmath52 where the operator @xmath53 accounts for the contribution coming from the motion of bath particles , whilst @xmath54 describes the contribution of the tracer motion itself .",
    "explicitly , for @xmath55 we have ( for @xmath56 )    @xmath57 where the first term describes the  birth  of a vacancy at the occupied site @xmath58 due to the jumps of a bath particle from @xmath58 to vacant sites @xmath59 ; the second term describes a  death  of a vacancy at a vacant site @xmath58 due to the jumps of a bath particle from sites @xmath59 .",
    "one readily notices that the nonlinear terms in eq.(8 ) cancel each other and @xmath53 is simply the second finite difference operator ( for @xmath56 )    @xmath60 the  diffusive  free particle like behavior in eq.(9 ) is , of course , the consequence of the fact that all bath particles are identical , leading to cancellation of non - linear terms in eq.(8 ) .",
    "consider now the contribution due to the motion of the tracer particle . in an explicit form we have ( for @xmath61 )    @xmath62 @xmath63 where the terms on the r - h - s of eq.(10 ) describe respectively the following events : ( a ) an @xmath64 site at the distance @xmath65 from the tracer becomes @xmath66 if the tracer jumps into the previously @xmath66 left - hand adjacent site and the site at distance @xmath67 is @xmath66 ; ( b ) a @xmath68 site at distance @xmath65 from the tracer becomes @xmath64 , if the tracer jumps into the previously @xmath66 left - hand adjacent site and the site at distance @xmath67 is @xmath64 ; ( c ) an @xmath64 site at distance @xmath65 becomes @xmath66 when the tracer jumps into the previously @xmath66 right - hand site and the site at distance @xmath69 is @xmath66 ; eventually , ( d ) a @xmath66 site at distance @xmath65 becomes @xmath70 when the tracer jumps into the previously @xmath66 right - hand site and the site at distance @xmath69 is @xmath64 .",
    "next , similar reasoning gives the behavior of @xmath51 in the immediate neighborhood of tracer , i.e. at sites with @xmath71 , which can be thought off as the boundary conditions for eq.(7 ) .",
    "time evolution of @xmath72 again is due to both the motion of the bath particles and of the tracer , i.e. can be represented in the form of eq.(7 ) , but here the operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given as    @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 explicitly , we have for @xmath76 the following equations    @xmath77 @xmath78    another pair of boundary conditions for eq.(10 ) can be obtained by assuming that correlations between @xmath43 and @xmath79 vanish in the limit @xmath80 , which seems quite plausible on physical grounds , and which may be checked numerically .",
    "we have from eq.(6 )    @xmath81 where we have used the normalization condition @xmath82 and also the assumption that at infinitely large separations from the tracer the mean concentration of vacancies is unperturbed and equal to its equilibrium value @xmath27 .",
    "eqs.(5 ) , ( 7 ) to ( 13 ) constitute a closed system of equations for the derivation of @xmath83 , within the framework outlined .",
    "solutions to these equations will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we first turn to the continuous - space description and rewrite our equations in the limit of continuous-@xmath84 . then , for @xmath85 we have for the operator    @xmath86 and , at points @xmath71 , eq.(11 ) yields    @xmath87    next , expanding @xmath88 and @xmath89 we obtain for the operator @xmath90 , eq.(10 ) , the following approximate expression @xmath91 which holds for @xmath85 .    the approximation as in eq.(19 ) ,",
    "in which the coefficient before the gradient term is equal to the @xmath92 velocity of the tracer particle , is equivalent to the neglect of fluctuations in the tracer trajectory @xmath41 . in the following",
    "we show , however , that such a  deterministic  approximation is quite appropriate and leads to results which are in good agreement with simulation data .",
    "the reason this approximation works here is that in such a system the fluctuations of the tracer trajectories are essentially suppressed .",
    "this is due to the accumulation of the bath particles in front of the tracer which hinders fluctuations with @xmath93 . at the same time , the fluctuations with @xmath94 are suppressed by the driving force .",
    "this leads to the mean - square deviation @xmath95 growing only as @xmath15 ( see the numerical results in fig.2 , where the @xmath96 is plotted versus @xmath97 ) , in a striking contrast to the linear time dependence for conventional driven diffusive motion .",
    "finally , within the same  deterministic  picture we obtain    @xmath98    combining eqs.(17 ) to ( 20 ) we obtain the following continuous - space equation    @xmath99 which is to be solved subject to the boundary conditions @xmath100 and boundary conditions at @xmath80 , defined in eq.(16 ) .",
    "let us consider first the behavior of @xmath51 for @xmath101 .",
    "we introduce a scaled variable @xmath102 , ( @xmath103 ) . in terms of @xmath104 eq.(21 ) takes the following form @xmath105 in which we have set @xmath106 and which is to be solved subject to the boundary conditions @xmath107    we hasten to remark that such an approach presumes already that @xmath18 is a time - independent constant and thus @xmath83 grows as @xmath108 .",
    "however , such an assumption will be seen to be self - consistent if it turns out to be possible ( and we set out to show that this is actually the case ) to find the solution of eq.(23 ) satisfying the boundary conditions in eqs.(25 ) .    the appropriate solution to eq.(23 ) , which satisfies the boundary condition at infinity , reads    @xmath109 where @xmath110,\\quad ( 27)\\ ] ] @xmath111 being the error function .",
    "the value of @xmath112 , which is the probability of having the r - h - s adjacent to the tracer site vacant , is to be defined from the boundary condition at @xmath113 , eq.(25 ) , which gives    @xmath114 we note here that @xmath18 is as yet unspecified parameter .",
    "consider next the behavior of @xmath51 , eq.(21 ) , past the tracer particle , i.e. in the domain @xmath116 .",
    "now we choose the scaled variable @xmath117 , ( @xmath118 ) . in terms of @xmath119 eq.(21 ) takes the form    @xmath120 with boundary conditions    @xmath121    the solution of eq.(29 ) , which satisfies the boundary at @xmath122 reads    @xmath123 where    @xmath124 \\quad ( 32)\\ ] ] the constant of integration @xmath125 ( which defines the probability of having the l - h - s adjacent to the tracer site vacant ) is to be determined from the boundary condition at @xmath126 , which gives    @xmath127    now we have a system of equations ( 28),(33 ) and ( 5),(24 ) , which determine the behavior of @xmath83 , @xmath112 and @xmath125 . in the following subsection",
    "we , construct a closed - form transcendental equation for the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "we may formally rewrite eq.(5 ) in terms of the parameters @xmath128 and @xmath129 as    @xmath130 further , using eqs.(34),(24 ) and ( 28 ) we have    @xmath131    let us note now that the r.h.s . of eq.(35 ) tends to zero as @xmath132 grows .",
    "this means that ( except for the case @xmath133 , when eq.(35 ) has only a trivial solution @xmath134 ) the value @xmath135 should tend to @xmath136 as @xmath137 . expressing @xmath138 as    @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a deviation from the equilibrium value @xmath112 , and assuming that at sufficiently large times this deviation is small enough to allow linearization of equation near the equilibrium , we have    @xmath141    now , from eq.(33 ) we express @xmath129 through the parameter @xmath4 , which gives    @xmath142 and substituting eq.(38 ) into the eq.(37 ) we get    @xmath143    finally , noticing that @xmath144 , and using the definition of the parameter @xmath18 , eq.(24 ) , we obtain the following closed transcendental equation for @xmath18    @xmath145 which , after some algebraic transformations , can be cast into a compact , symmetric form    @xmath146 where the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath147 ( eqs .",
    "( 27 ) and ( 32 ) ) has been made explicit .",
    "a simple analysis shows that eq.(41 ) has positive bounded solutions @xmath148 for any values of @xmath20 , @xmath36 and @xmath27 ( except the trivial case @xmath149 when bath particles are absent ) .",
    "this means , in turn , that our approach to the solutions of coupled eqs.(23),(25),(29 ) and ( 30 ) is self - consistent and @xmath83 actually grows in proportion to @xmath97 . in the trivial case",
    "when @xmath133 ( when one expects , of course , the linear growth of @xmath83 ) eq.(41 ) reduces to    @xmath150 whose root is given by    @xmath151 which means that @xmath152 and thus @xmath1 grows at a faster rate than @xmath15 .",
    "behavior of the prefactor @xmath4 is presented in fig.1 , in which we plot the numerical solution of eq.(41 ) for different values of the transition probabilities and different concentrations @xmath7 . in the next subsection we present analytical estimates of the behavior of @xmath4 in several limiting situations .",
    "we start by considering situations in which the parameter @xmath18 can be expected to be small ; namely , when @xmath20 is close to @xmath21 ( in other words when @xmath154 is only slightly above @xmath155 ) or when the vacancy concentration is small , @xmath156 . in the limit of small @xmath18 the leading terms in eqs.(27 ) and ( 32 )",
    "behave as    @xmath157 and eq.(41 ) takes the form    @xmath158 and gives for small @xmath4 , @xmath159 ,    @xmath160 consequently , in this limit the explicit formula for the mean displacement will read    @xmath161    at this point it might be instructive to recall the analysis in @xcite which concerned the validity of the einstein relation for one - dimensional hard - core lattice gases .",
    "define the ",
    "diffusion coefficient  of the tracer particle in the symmetric case as @xmath162 , where @xmath163 and the  mobility  as @xmath164 , where the stationary velocity is given by @xmath165 , @xmath166 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that for the infinitely large system the einstein relation , i.e. the equation @xmath167 , holds trivially , since both @xmath168 and @xmath169 are equal to zero .",
    "a somewhat stronger result has been obtained for the case when the one - dimensional lattice is a ring of length @xmath170 .",
    "it was shown that here both @xmath168 and @xmath169 are finite , vanish with the length of the ring as @xmath171 and obey the einstein relation @xmath172 .",
    "our result in eq.(47 ) reveals that for the infinite lattice einstein relation is valid for the time - dependent  diffusion coefficient  and mobility , i.e. equation @xmath173 holds exactly , provided that the time is sufficiently large such that both eqs.(1 ) and ( 47 ) are valid .",
    "consider next the situation when @xmath4 is expected to be large , i.e. when @xmath7 is close to unity .",
    "expanding the functions @xmath174 and @xmath175 as    @xmath176 and @xmath177 we arrive at the following equation    @xmath178 one may readily notice that when @xmath18 is large , the r.h.s . of eq.(50 ) tends to zero and thus we have    @xmath179 eq.(51 ) allows formulation of the conditions when @xmath18 is large more precisely : this happens when @xmath27 obeys the inequality @xmath180 .    in this limit",
    "the mean displacement of the tracer particle obeys    @xmath181    finally , let us consider the case of the directed walk in a one - dimensional lattice gas , when @xmath182 and @xmath183 , which was previously examined in @xcite . in this case eq.(41 ) simplifies considerably and reads    @xmath184 when @xmath7 is small , @xmath185 , we have from eq.(53 )    @xmath186 which is consistent with the result in eq.(47 ) , while in the limit @xmath187 , eq.(53 ) yields    @xmath188 i.e. exactly the behavior in eq.(51 ) with @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "in order to check the analytical predictions of sections iv and v monte carlo ( mc ) simulations have been performed .",
    "the simulation algorithm was defined as follows : the total number of particles in the system was held constant at @xmath189 ( @xmath190 bath particles and one tracer ) .",
    "we constructed a one - dimensional regular lattice of unit spacing and length @xmath191 , sites of which were labelled by integers on the interval @xmath192 $ ] . for each @xmath22",
    "the length was chosen as @xmath193 the number of particles and , thus , @xmath194 was chosen to be large enough so that over the time scale of the simulations the mean vacancy density near @xmath195 was unaffected by the dynamics of the tracer which always occupied the lattice site @xmath196 at @xmath197 at the zero moment of mc time particles were placed randomly on the lattice with the prescribed mean concentration and the constraint that no two particles can simultaneously occupy the same site .",
    "the tracer particle was placed at the origin .",
    "the subsequent particle dynamics employed in simulations follows the definitions of section 2 closely . at each mc time step",
    "we select , at random , one particle and let it choose a potential jump direction .",
    "if the selected particle is a bath particle , it chooses the direction of the jump - to the right or to the left , with the probability @xmath198 .",
    "if the selected particle is the tracer - it chooses the hop to the right with probability @xmath20 and the hop to the left with probability @xmath21 , @xmath199 . for any particle",
    "the jump is instantly fulfilled if at this moment of time the adjacent site in the chosen direction is vacant .    in simulations we followed the time evolution of the displacement of the tracer particle and plotted it versus the  physical time  , which is the time needed for each particle to move once , on average .",
    "fig.2 presents typical behavior of the average displacement calculated for fixed @xmath21 and @xmath27 ( the actual parameter for the presented results are @xmath200 and @xmath201 the results for other values of @xmath27 and @xmath21 are similar ) plotted versus @xmath15 .",
    "the dotted line in this figure shows the evolution of the deviation from the mean average displacement @xmath202 which shows growth in proportion to @xmath203 .",
    "numerical results for the time evolution of the mean displacement , performed for different values of parameters @xmath27 and @xmath20 , were used to obtain a numerical evaluation of the prefactor in eq.(3 ) as a function of @xmath27 and @xmath20 . in fig.3",
    "we plot , for the particular case of totally directed walk @xmath200 , the prefactor @xmath18 versus the inverse concentration of vacancies .",
    "the solid line represents the results of our analytic calculations while the squares show the numerical results . in fig.4 , for fixed concentration of the vacancies @xmath204 we present the comparison between the analytical predictions of the prefactor @xmath4 and the numerical mc results .",
    "to conclude , we have examined the behavior of the mean displacement of a driven tracer particle moving in a symmetric hard - core lattice gas .",
    "we have shown that the mean displacement grows in proportion to @xmath15 , i.e. the hard - core interactions hinder the ballistic motion of the tracer and introduce effective frictional forces .",
