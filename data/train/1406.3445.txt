    "this notation indicates that a limited class of 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9qp states that contribute to multi - phonon @xmath0-vibrational states are taken into account . among these , the model space was truncated up to the @xmath53 terms in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "it should be noted that the tilt of the rotational axis brought about by large triaxial deformations can mix signature quantum number in general .",

    "this result can be understood as follows . as discussed already ,",
    "the highest - lying collective states are the most collective and have the highest @xmath10 because of the parallel coupling @xmath127 for @xmath82 states at around @xmath60 . because of @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the effective single - particle angular momentum of particle - vibration coupled states , high-@xmath10 states have fairly pure high @xmath129 .",
    "consequently they feel strong coriolis force when rotation sets in .",
    "then they start to align their angular momenta to the rotational ( @xmath130 ) axis with reducing @xmath10 , accordingly they reduce their purity and the peak height in figs .  [ fig1 ] and [ fig7 ] gradually .",
    "this is an aspect of rotational @xmath10 mixing .",
    "therefore it is expected that the collective @xmath7 state with @xmath10 lower than the highest value @xmath131 would be observed .",
    "actually , the observed band ( 4 ) with @xmath108 , indicated by large crosses in the figures , sits around the location determined by connecting the most collective states at @xmath60 and 0.3 mev in the case of @xmath6nb .",
    "the situation in @xmath3nb is to some extent similar , but ( i ) the lowest collective state at high @xmath46 is not collective enough and ( ii ) the calculated states are located higher overall .",
    "more sophisticated calculation would be desired because these observations depend on how band crossings occur and in the present model interband interactions occur at the same @xmath46 rather than the same @xmath94 .",
    "the observed enhanced @xmath4s look to be accounted for primarily by vibrational collectivity , and the above scenario that the collectivity of the twentieth state at @xmath60 is observed with a lower @xmath10 after band crossing(s ) can lead to enhanced transitions to the @xmath1 . before studying @xmath132 transitions , i check the results of the generarized intensity relation on @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "some calculated values for @xmath3nb that can be compared with the observed @xmath4 ratios are shown in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "note here that @xmath135 eb gives the zero - point amplitude @xmath136 , defined by @xmath137  @xcite , by combining with @xmath1381.090 eb .",
    "this is larger than the absolute value of the adopted static triaxial deformation .",
    ".properties of calculated @xmath55 transitions with @xmath56 1 , 2 , and 3 , designated by the labels of intrinsic states , in @xmath3nb .",
    "the moment of inertia , @xmath139 mev@xmath112 , extracted from the energy of the @xmath140 state in the ground band through @xmath141 , was used . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     i proceed to @xmath6nb , in which more conspicuous enhancement of @xmath4 is observed . in this case @xmath142 is @xmath143 and again larger than @xmath144 .",
    "the calculated values in table  [ table2 ] give @xmath145 2.44 and @xmath146 4.37 , while the corresponding experimental values are 2.01(24 ) and 1.94(25 ) , respectively .",
    "the calculated values are similar to those of @xmath3nb but in the experimental ones the magnitude of the denominator is inverted .    for those from the @xmath7 candidates , the calculated values are @xmath147 10.8 and @xmath148 19.5 , while the corresponding experimental values are 27.5(33 ) and 40.5(55 ) .",
    "the degree of enhancement increases from @xmath3nb both in the calculation and in the data . in the calculation",
    ", this is caused by a cooperation of increase of the numerator and decrease of the denominator . by close examination ,",
    "the difference in @xmath59 , magnified by the angular - momentum factor , @xmath149 , produces the difference in the @xmath4 in the numerator .",
    "again the differences in the ratios from the data are within factors of 2  3 .",
    "this indicates that the main mechanism of the enhancement of @xmath4 is the vibrational collectivity as expected , and the angular - momentum effect is also important for the enhancement .",
    "therefore , from the present analyses , it appears promising that the main component of the observed band ( 4 ) is a three - phonon @xmath0 vibration although some mixing with states that are not included in the present model would be possible .",
    "the single- and multi - phonon @xmath0-vibrational states in @xmath3nb and @xmath6nb have been studied by using the particle - vibration coupling model based on the cranking model and the random - phase approximation .",
    "the calculations have been done in the model space including up to @xmath8 basis states .",
    "this is an extension of the previous calculations including up to @xmath1 basis states .",
    "analyses of aligned angular momenta and wave functions identified the highest lying among the calculated collective states as the most collective and of the highest @xmath150 for @xmath82 states at @xmath60 .",
    "then , @xmath26 and @xmath1 states have been directly identified with the observed ones and shown to reproduce the observed spectrum precisely . in the case of @xmath7 states ,",
    "the routhian of the @xmath151 state is lowered by strong coriolis force . because this alignment process reduces @xmath10 ,",
    "the most collective state is expected to be observed as a band with a lower @xmath10 . based on this scenario , the interband @xmath4s for @xmath55 transitions with @xmath56 1 , 2 , and 3",
    "have been calculated by adopting the method of the generalized intensity relation .",
    "states with @xmath152 and 2 were found to reproduce well the observed ones .",
    "the calculated @xmath132 transition rates have accounted for the observed enhancement of the transitions from the @xmath7 candidates to @xmath1 states within factors of 2  3 , primarily by the vibrational collectivity and secondly by the angular - momentum effect .",
    "these analyses indicate that the main component of the observed band ( 4 ) is a three - phonon @xmath0 vibration ."
