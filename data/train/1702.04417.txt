    "let @xmath2 be a smooth oriented spin 4-manifold with the rational homology of @xmath6 .",
    "such manifolds play an important role in the study of homology cobordisms of homology 3-spheres and in addressing certain classification problems in 4-dimensional topology ; see discussion in @xcite .",
    "their study , however , represents a challenge because the usual count of the seiberg ",
    "witten monopoles on @xmath2 generally depends on the auxiliary choices of metric and perturbation and hence does not result in a smooth invariant of @xmath2 .",
    "this problem has been remedied by mrowka , ruberman , and saveliev @xcite , who defined an invariant @xmath0 for integral homology @xmath7 by adding an index - theoretic correction term to the count of the seiberg ",
    "witten monopoles on @xmath2 ; we will extend their definition to the case of rational homology @xmath7 in this paper . because of its gauge theoretic nature , the invariant @xmath0 is difficult to compute directly from its definition .",
    "we address this problem in the current paper by expressing @xmath0 in terms of floer theoretic invariants via a gluing theory , the way it is done for the classical seiberg  witten invariants .",
    "an invariant relevant to this gluing theory was defined by fryshov @xcite : under the additional hypothesis that a generator of @xmath8 is carried by an embedded rational homology sphere @xmath9 , he showed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8) that the invariant @xmath10 arising from the monopole floer homology of @xmath9 with the induced spin structure @xmath11 is an invariant of the spin manifold @xmath2 alone ; we will denote this invariant by @xmath4 .",
    "the invariants @xmath0 and @xmath4 are certainly different : for instance , the mod @xmath12 reduction of @xmath0 equals the rohlin invariant of @xmath2 , while this is not the case for @xmath4 .",
    "the following theorem establishes a precise relation between @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is followed by some strong applications ( theorems [ t : psc ] , [ t : theta ] , and [ t : theta2 ] below ) to the study of metrics of positive scalar curvature and of the homology cobordism group of homology 3-spheres .",
    "[ t : main ] let @xmath2 be a smooth oriented spin rational homology @xmath7 which is homology oriented by a choice of generator in @xmath13 .",
    "assume that the poincar dual of this generator is realized by a rational homology sphere @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the induced spin structure on @xmath9 , and let @xmath15 be the spin cobordism from @xmath9 to itself obtained by cutting @xmath2 open along @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath16    the reduced monopole floer homology @xmath17 that appears in the statement of this theorem is the floer theory defined by kronheimer and mrowka @xcite , with rational coefficients .",
    "we could use instead the monopole floer homology defined by fryshov @xcite , which would change the sign of the lefschetz number because of different grading conventions in the two theories .",
    "the rational homology sphere @xmath9 in theorem [ t : main ] is oriented by the rule that the orientation on a curve hom - dual to @xmath18 followed by the orientation on @xmath9 gives the orientation on @xmath2 . the precise sign convention for @xmath0",
    "is described in section [ s : lsw ] . in the special case of @xmath19 , where @xmath9 is an integral homology sphere , theorem [ t : main ] reduces to a theorem of fryshov (",
    "* theorem 5 ) which relates the casson invariant @xmath20 , the fryshov invariant @xmath21 , and the euler characteristic of @xmath22 .",
    "an analogous theorem ( * ? ? ? * theorem 7 ) holds for manifolds @xmath2 with @xmath23 once the term @xmath24 in formula ( [ e : main ] ) is replaced by the usual seiberg ",
    "witten invariant .",
    "the proof of theorem [ t : main ] relies on the calculation of the two terms in the definition of @xmath0 , the count of the seiberg ",
    "witten monopoles on @xmath2 and the index - theoretic correction term , using metrics on @xmath2 with long necks @xmath25",
    ". this neck stretching technique for counting monopoles is well known in gauge theory , although mainly in the separating case .",
    "the non - separating case at hand was studied in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 11.1 ) under the technical assumption of the absence of reducible monopoles on the non - compact manifold @xmath26 obtained by attaching infinite product ends to @xmath15 . in our case",
    ", this assumption fails because @xmath27 .",
    "instead , we prove that such a reducible monopole does not cause any trouble because it is isolated in the sense that a sequence of irreducible monopoles on @xmath2 can not converge to it as @xmath28 .",
    "this is proved using an a priori estimate on the smallest eigenvalue of the dirac laplacian on a manifold with long neck .",
    "we provide a detailed argument in sections [ s : eigenvalue ] , [ s : compact ] , and [ s : gluing ] , which all use the setup of the book @xcite . as a result , we are able to match the count of monopoles on @xmath2 with a certain lefschetz number in the monopole floer chain complex .",
    "the truly novel part of the proof of theorem [ t : main ] , however , is the calculation of the correction term in @xmath0 , which boils down to calculating the index of the spin dirac operator on a manifold with periodic end modeled on the infinite cyclic cover of @xmath2 as @xmath28 .",
    "this is done in two substantially different ways , one direct in section [ s : correction ] and the other using the end - periodic index theorem of @xcite in section [ s : eta ] .",
    "a very useful technical result underpinning the proof of theorem [ t : main ] is the existence of riemannian metrics on the manifold @xmath26 with infinite product ends which make the @xmath29 sobolev completion of the spin dirac operator invertible .",
    "this existence result , which is proved in section [ s : generic ] in all dimensions divisible by four , is an extension of the generic metric theorem of @xcite to certain non - compact manifolds .",
    "one advantage of working with such generic metrics is that they greatly simplify the treatment of perturbations needed to ensure the regularity of the seiberg ",
    "witten moduli spaces , and allow to avoid perturbations on manifolds with periodic ends altogether .",
    "see the discussion at the end of section [ s : lsw ] .",
    "the splitting formula of theorem  [ t : main ] makes the invariant @xmath0 computable in a number of cases .",
    "this is due , on one hand , to the availability of advanced computational tools in monopole floer homology ( such as floer exact triangles and the @xmath30 symmetry ) , and on the other , to the identification between monopole floer homology and heegaard floer homology , by the work of kutluhan , lee , and taubes @xcite , or alternatively , the work of colin , ghiggini , and honda @xcite and taubes @xcite .",
    "this newly found computability of @xmath0 leads to a number of applications , of which we present two in sections  [ s : theorem b ] and [ s : theorem c ] . in both applications , the lefschetz number in formula vanishes , albeit for different reasons",
    "the first application gives an obstruction to a @xmath1-manifold having a riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature .",
    "historically  @xcite , the seiberg ",
    "witten invariants have been used to produce many obstructions of this nature that go well beyond the classical index - theoretic obstruction of lichnerowicz  @xcite .",
    "we add to this body of knowledge the following theorem , which was originally proved by the first - named author  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.2 ) using different techniques .",
    "it was conjectured in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 1 ) that there should exist a proof along the lines of this paper .",

    "then @xmath2 admits no riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature unless @xmath32 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath0 reduces modulo @xmath12 to the rohlin invariant @xmath33 .",
    "as in  @xcite , this fact leads to the corollary that , if @xmath2 admits a metric of positive scalar curvature , any rational homology sphere @xmath9 carrying the generator of @xmath8 must satisfy the relation @xmath34 with respect to the induces spin structure @xmath11 .",
    "for example , if a generator of @xmath8 is carried by the brieskorn homology sphere @xmath35 , then @xmath2 can not admit a positive scalar curvature metric .",
    "the second , and more elaborate , application is to the study of homology cobordisms .",

    "it seems reasonable to conjecture that @xmath45 in fact implies that @xmath9 has infinite order in @xmath47 ; indeed , this was shown to be true for all seifert fibered homology spheres by the third - named author  @xcite .",
    "generalizing this result , we show that the conjecture holds under an additional assumption that @xmath9 is @xmath48-positive or @xmath48-negative : a @xmath38 homology sphere @xmath9 is said to be @xmath48-positive ( respectively , @xmath48-negative ) if the reduced monopole homology @xmath17 corresponding to the unique spin structure @xmath11 on @xmath9 is supported in degrees @xmath49 ( respectively , @xmath50 ) ; see definition [ defi : h - positive / h - negative ] for more details .",
