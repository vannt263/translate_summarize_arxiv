    "the difference between the classical and quantum mechanical description of physical systems is often discussed in terms of nonclassicality .",
    "this topic is of general interest , since it gives insight into the reasons why a classical picture of nature has to fail , and provides methods to explore what a quantum mechanical system can do which a classical system can not . in particular ,",
    "such issues are of great importance for numerous fields in quantum optics , quantum computation , quantum information , and related research areas .",
    "nonclassicality of the harmonic oscillator has been well understood during the last years .",
    "its definition is based on the coherent states @xmath2 , parameterized by a complex amplitude @xmath3 .",
    "the evolution of these pure quantum states most closely corresponds to the classical evolution of position and momentum .",
    "they are minimum uncertainty states with a stable gaussian wave packet . in this sense they represent the closest analogue to the classical behavior . furthermore , they allow to decompose any quantum state in the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the glauber - sudarshan @xmath6 function  @xcite . in this representation",
    ", an arbitrary quantum state formally resembles a statistical mixture of ( classical ) coherent states .",
    "however , for many states @xmath5 may show negativities , which can not be interpreted in terms of statistical probability densities .",
    "such states are consequently referred to as nonclassical  @xcite .",
    "atomic coherent states ( acs ) have already been developed in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that their interaction with a classical electric and magnetic field can be understood classically , cf .",
    "@xcite , and any density operator can be formally written as a statistical average over acs .",
    "this remarkable property allows one to define nonclassicality in a way closely corresponding to that of the harmonic oscillator  @xcite .",
    "specific nonclassical properties of atomic systems have already been discussed in previous publications , such as spin squeezing  @xcite and squeezing in ramsey spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the creation of entanglement in spin systems  @xcite and the relation between entanglement and squeezing  @xcite have also been studied .",
    "recently , nonclassicality has been examined in terms of measurable probability distributions  @xcite .",
    "the present manuscript addresses a method to visualize nonclassicality of atomic systems , characterized by angular momentum states with a large orientation in the @xmath7-direction and small fluctuations along the two orthogonal directions . to provide a simple and experimentally accessible condition for the detection of the nonclassical features of the system",
    ", we introduce the concept of a regularized atomic quadrature quasiprobability ( aqqp ) .",
    "our method is applied to experimental data from approximately @xmath8 two - level atoms , which were collectively prepared in an atomic spin - squeezed state .",
    "it uncovers the nonclassical properties , even for weak squeezing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we give a short introduction into the quantum mechanical description of the angular momentum , and review the holstein - primakoff approximation .",
    "then , we explain the verification of nonclassical effects by nonclassicality quasiprobabilities and define nonclassicality quadrature distributions . the experimental results , including the setup and data analysis , are given in sec .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in sec .  iv .",
    "formally , the atomic ensemble under study can be characterized as an angular momentum system . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the angular momentum is described by a vector valued operator @xmath9 , satisfying the commutation relations ( setting @xmath10 ) : @xmath11 = { \\mathrm{i}}\\hat j_z,\\quad [ \\hat j_y,\\hat j_z ] = { \\mathrm{i}}\\hat j_x,\\quad [ \\hat j_z,\\hat j_x ] = { \\mathrm{i}}\\hat j_y.\\ ] ] furthermore , we introduce the angular momentum ladder operators @xmath12 , whose commutator is given by @xmath13 = 2 \\hat j_z$ ] . throughout this work",
    ", we keep the quantum number @xmath14 fixed , while the quantum number @xmath15 takes values in @xmath16 .",
    "the foundation for the discussion of nonclassicality is typically given by the coherent states , being defined as  @xcite @xmath17 where the fiducial state @xmath18 is the common eigenstate of the operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 with maximum eigenvalue for the latter operator .",
    "these coherent states can be seen as the analog to a classical angular momentum state .",
    "they have minimum uncertainty in @xmath19 , and their expectation value of the projection of @xmath21 , @xmath22 is exactly equal to @xmath14 , without uncertainty , such that the state @xmath23 can be understood as pointing exactly in the direction of @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , their time evolution in a classical magnetic field exactly matches the classical evolution  @xcite .",
    "finally , there exists a representation of the density operator of an arbitrary quantum state in the form @xmath25 similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gs ] ) , this is formally equivalent to a decomposition of a quantum state into a statistical mixture of ( classical ) coherent states .",
    "therefore , all quantum states , for which the weight function @xmath26 is non - negative , are classical angular momentum states .",
    "conversely , any quantum state for which such a non - negative function @xmath26 does not exist , will be referred as being nonclassical  @xcite .",
    "let us consider a system with a large angular momentum , i.e.  @xmath27 , which is mainly aligned in the @xmath7-direction . in this case",
    ", the operator @xmath20 can be approximated by its expectation value @xmath28 , being a real number as in classical physics .",
    "only the remaining angular momentum components @xmath29 are treated fully quantum - mechanically  @xcite .",
    "then , the ladder operators satisfy the approximated commutator relation @xmath30 \\approx 2 j.\\ ] ]    the re - normalized operators @xmath31 obey the same algebra as the bosonic operators .",
    "we may introduce rescaled angular momentum components via @xmath32 , which are defined such that the uncertainty of the ground state , @xmath33 .",
    "the weight function @xmath26 corresponds to the glauber - sudarshan @xmath6 function of the quantum state , with the complex argument @xmath34 .",
    "the properties of @xmath5 form the basis for defining nonclassicality of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "consequently , we can reformulate established methods for nonclassicality for angular momentum systems .",
    "although the @xmath6 function uniquely defines the nonclassicality of a quantum system , its reconstruction is in general impossible for the harmonic oscillator , since it can be highly singular . for getting definite answers about nonclassical effects , one may introduce a filtered atomic @xmath6 function , in close analogy to that of the harmonic oscillator  @xcite . for atomic systems , one multiplies the characteristic function @xmath35 of @xmath26 , @xmath36 with a suitable filter function @xmath37 ( parameterized by @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 the atomic nonclassicality quasiprobability is then given by @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the filter function @xmath37 has to satisfy certain properties : first , it has to guarantee that the nonclassicality quasiprobability of any state is always regular .",
    "second , it only should show negativities if the quantum state is nonclassical . for the harmonic oscillator we have shown  @xcite that for any nonclassical state",
    "one finds a nonclassicality quasiprobability demonstrating negativities by simply varying a real parameter @xmath38 that scales the filter width .      in the following",
    "we will introduce the aqqp to efficiently characterize nonclassicality of atomic spin systems with a minimum of measured data .",
    "quadrature distributions are just probability densities , so that a regularization procedure is superfluous .",
    "the situation changes if one analyzes the quadrature statistics beyond the ground - state noise level  @xcite , to visualize usually hidden nonclassical effects , also beyond the negativities of the wigner function  @xcite .",
    "subsequent filtering yields the marginals of @xmath42 .",
    "introducing atomic quadrature operators @xmath43 , @xmath44 we define the aqqp via @xmath45 which is just a marginal of @xmath42 for a fixed angle @xmath46 .",
    "clearly , if such a marginal distribution shows negativities , then @xmath42 has negativities as well , and the state is nonclassical . in general , the inverse conclusion is not true .    the aqqp distribution can be sampled from a set of @xmath47 measured angular momentum values @xmath48 directly by using a similar approach to  @xcite .",
    "hence an estimator for the aqqp is expressed as an empirical mean of a suitable pattern function @xmath49 , @xmath50 the required pattern function is given by @xmath51 furthermore , the uncertainty of @xmath52 can be estimated as @xmath53 times the empirical standard deviation of the sampled numbers @xmath54 . therefore , the sampling method is a very simple way to estimate the quantity of interest together with its statistical error .",
    "the setup is described in detail in @xcite : a cloud of @xmath55 cold cesium atoms is prepared by laser cooling in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and subsequently transferred into a far off - resonant dipole trap formed in the @xmath56{\\mu m}$ ] waist of a single @xmath57{w}$ ] , @xmath58{nm}$ ] laser beam . employing a sequence of optical pumping pulses , microwave pulses , ( optical ) purification pulses , a magnetic bias field of approximately @xmath59{gauss}$ ] , and a resonant microwave @xmath60 pulse , each atom is prepared in the state @xmath61 .    in a simplified picture",
    "we describe each atom as a two - level system with pseudo - spin @xmath62 and with basis states @xmath63 , with @xmath64 . the atomic population difference in the two hyper - fine manifolds @xmath65 and",
    "@xmath66 now can be regarded as the @xmath67component of a collective @xmath68-pseudospin vector .",
    "this corresponds to the sum of the individual pseudo - spins , @xmath69 , an acs .    by detecting the differential phase shifts @xmath70 that the atomic cloud imprints on a bichromatic , off - resonant optical probe pulse  @xcite we measure the atomic population difference @xmath71 between the two hyper - fine levels . in this way",
    "we perform a non - destructive quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement of @xmath72 , which projects the atomic state into a squeezed state around @xmath73 . here",
    "@xmath74 denotes the outcome of the qnd measurement and the parameter @xmath75 is a function of the qnd measurement strength , which is directly proportional to the optical density of the ensemble and the probability of spontaneous photon emission  @xcite .",
    "a  subsequent verification measurement @xmath76 , performed on the same ensemble , shows sub - projection noise quantum fluctuations of the differential phase shift with respect to the prediction @xmath73 .",
    "as it is characteristic for qnd measurements the signal - to - noise ratio ( and therefore the measurement strength ) is limited by the quantum noise of the meter system  in our case by the shot noise @xmath77 of the probe light : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the light - atom coupling strength .",
    "although the destructive second measurement uses more photons ( @xmath80 ) than the entangling qnd measurement , it still contains a fair amount of light shot noise ( see fig.[fig : noise ] ) .       for different atom numbers ; each data point is formed by 4841 individual measurements .",
    "the scaling of the noise as a function of the number of atoms @xmath81 allows us to identify noise contributions .",
    "blue ( dark shaded ) area : light shot noise .",
    "green ( bright shaded ) area : atomic projection noise .",
    "red ( grey shaded ) areas : technical fluctuations .",
    "black dashed line : predicted noise for a acs with the same collective @xmath82 as our squeezed state .",
    "magenta diamonds : @xmath83 for experiments with different @xmath81 . ]    to be able to convert the @xmath47 measurement outcomes @xmath84 @xmath85 into quadrature samples , we calibrate our experiment as follows :    * we prepare a acs using a varying number of trapped atoms @xmath81 and , for calibration purposes only , subtract measurement outcomes @xmath86 from successive independent mot loading cycles ( @xmath87{s}$ ] apart ) to compensate for slow drifts of experimental parameters . by performing a scaling analysis @xcite on the differential values @xmath88",
    "we can identify the amount of light shot noise @xmath89 and atomic quantum projection noise @xmath90 and discriminate those against technical noise sources . * additionally , due to spontaneous emission processes caused by the @xmath74-measurement , performed with @xmath91 photons , the atomic state is not pure anymore and compared to the acs the ramsey - fringe contrast ( and thus the macroscopic spin @xmath14 of the ensemble ) is reduced by a factor @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the decoherence per photon , determined experimentally as described in @xcite .    with these calibrations",
    "we can calculate the phase fluctuations that we would measure in the absence of any technical noise for a acs comprised of @xmath94 atoms , which yields the same ramsey fringe amplitude as our squeezed state : @xmath95    for a varying number of atoms @xmath96 we perform in total @xmath97 experiments and obtain phase shift measurements @xmath98 , now _ without _ taking the difference between subsequent mot loading cycles .",
    "we convert the @xmath98 into quadrature values by normalizing to @xmath99 : @xmath100    the @xmath101 do not only contain the atomic signal @xmath102 but also added photon shot noise , which is gaussian noise , uncorrelated with the atomic population difference @xmath71 . due to the normalization procedure",
    "the effect of such added gaussian noise is equivalent to a detection with a reduced quantum efficiency @xcite ( mixing with an acs ) .",
    "the effective quantum efficiency of our quadrature measurement depends on the atomic signal to shot noise-ratio and is therefore a function of @xmath81 : @xmath103 in our experiment , it reaches values up to @xmath104 for measurements taken with the highest number of atoms @xmath105 .",
    "this effect only attenuates negativities of the nonclassicality quasiprobability @xmath106 and any nonclassicality found in @xmath101 is therefore sufficient to prove a nonclassical atomic state in the pseudospin operators @xmath107 .      in the following , we only consider experiments performed with an effective detection efficiency above @xmath108 , which show a quadrature variance @xmath109{db}$ ] below the projection noise . from the @xmath110 data points , we can estimate the aqqp according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : estimate : p : omega ] ) , by using a one - dimensional autocorrelation filter @xmath111 with @xmath112 and @xmath113 ^ 2 dk$ ] .",
    "this filter preserves all information about the distribution , but only displays negativities for nonclassical states .",
    "first , we look at the significance of the negativity as a function of the filter width , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the standard deviation of the estimate @xmath52 .",
    "this quantity is nothing but the value of the negativity in terms of standard deviations of the measurement . for observing nonclassical effects",
    ", this quantity has to be negative . from our experimental data ,",
    "we always observe such negative significance .",
    "moreover , the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig : w ] shows the dependence of its absolute value on the filter width @xmath38 .",
    "it can be seen that there is a filter width , for which the significance is optimized . in case of squeezing , this may even be arbitrarily close to @xmath116 . here",
    ", we can obtain a significance of up to @xmath1 standard deviations .    .",
    "the error bars are smaller than the linewidths .",
    "the dashed green curve shows the standard quadrature distribution ( i.e.  the marginal of the wigner function ) , which is non - negative .",
    "inset : significance @xmath117 of the negativity of the aqqp versus the width parameter . ]",
    "[ fig : sig : w ]    the main part of fig .",
    "[ fig : p : omega ] shows the aqqp of the corresponding state . here",
    ", the filter width is chosen to be @xmath118 , which gives a smaller significance of @xmath119 standard deviations , but also leads to more pronounced effects .",
    "we observe oscillations with significant negativities .",
    "since the autocorrelation function ( eq .  ( [ eq : autocorrelation ] ) ) fulfills the requirements of a filter function as listed in the theory part by construction , the negativities of the aqqp clearly reflect the nonclassicality of the quantum state .",
    "we introduced the atomic quadrature quasiprobability , @xmath52 , for atomic systems described by angular momentum states in the holstein - primakoff approximation .",
    "its negativities certify negativities of the glauber - sudarshan @xmath6-function of the atomic system , and hence the nonclassicality of the state beyond both the ground - state noise level and negativities of the wigner function .",
    "we apply our method to experimental data observed in a squeezed atomic ensemble and demonstrate nonclassicality with a statistical significance of up to @xmath1 standard deviations .",
    "we consider our method a valuable tool for certifying nonclassicality especially for states prepared in composed many - identical - particle systems such as cold atomic clouds , vapor cells or rare - earth doped crystals for quantum technology and -communication applications .",
