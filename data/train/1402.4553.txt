    "minimum error discrimination is one of the oldest problems in quantum state discrimination .",
    "the problem arises due to the vectorial nature of states which makes them indistinguishable through measurement . to infer what the state is",
    ", one has to perform measurement .",
    "non - orthogonality of states implies that the measurement operators can not perfectly distinguish one state from the other leading to errors in the discrimination procedure .",
    "different measurement strategies have different performance strength ( measured in terms of the average probability of error or the average probability of success ) .",
    "given that the states can not be distinguished perfectly there must be some measurement criterion which one could adopt to attain a maximum probability of success .",
    "to find what this measurement strategy is , is the problem of quantum state discrimination .",
    "the setting in minimum error discrimination or quantum hypothesis testing or ambiguous state discrimination is the following : a has a fixed ensembled of states @xmath0 from which she selects one with certain probability @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) respectvely and gives it to b. b knows that a has selected this state from that fixed set with those probabilities and his job now figure out which state he has been given using an m element povm .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between elements in a s ensemble @xmath3 and b s povm elements @xmath4 so that when the ith measurement outcome clicks , b infers a gave him the ith state from her ensemble .",
    "one can infer that the non - orthogonality of the ensemble elements implies that errors are likely to occur .",
    "b s job is to now find the optimal povm for maximizing the average probability of success of his outcome .",
    "there are other variants to the state discrimination problem@xcite@xcite .",
    "the most popular alternative of them is called unambiguous state discrimination .",
    "the idea is that the measurement outcomes are now m+1 in number where , as in the med case , there is a one - to - one correspondence between ensemble elements and the first m povm elements . in this problem ,",
    "the povm is designed such that only when a sends b the ith state will the ith povm element click , otherwise it wo nt .",
    "the trade - off is the m+1th element in the ensemble which is the `` inconclusive '' outcomer result i.e. b can say nothing about the state a sent him when this povm element clicks .",
    "heuristically one can expect that a set of linearly dependent states can not be unambiguously discriminated in this manner , an idea that was proven true later@xcite .",
    "the more recent proposal of maxmimum confidence measurements is the application of unambiguous state discrimination to linearly dependent ensembles i.e. when linearly dependent then the measurement which maximizes the confidence of the state measured being the correct one .",
    "coming back to med , necessary and sufficient conditions which the optimal povm has ( or have ) to satisfy were given by holevo@xcite and yuen@xcite independently .",
    "the latter cast med into a linear programming ( and now sdp ) problem for which numerical solutions can now be approximated within polynomial time .",
    "while there are quite a number of numerical techniques to obtain the optimal povm upto very good approximation@xcite , for very few ensembles has the med problem been solved analytically .",
    "compare that with the unambiguous state discrimination for which many more general ensembles have been solved.@xcite some of these include ensemble of two states@xcite , ensembles whose density matrix is maximally mixed state@xcite , equiprobable ensembles that lie on the orbit of a unitary@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and recently three mixed qubit states@xcite .",
    "for linearly independent pure state ensembles just the two - state ensemble problem has been solved but nobody has been able to give a solution for three linearly independent pure states .",
    "we are motivated to understand what makes the three linearly independent pure state problem so difficult . for this purpose",
    "the problem is cast in different settings : ( i ) first it is cast in a geometric setting i.e. we make use of the geometry of the qutrit bloch sphere @xcite to see what the problem looks like .",
    "corresponding to the necessary and sufficient conditions given by holevo and yuen we get a set of simultaneous multivariate non - linear polynomial equations in terms of the components of the 8 dimensional qutrit bloch vectors of three states dual to the linearly independent pure states of the ensemble . it can be seen how complicated the problem here when contrasted with the simplicity of the two state discrimnation problem which is trivial once the problem is cast in the qubit state space.(ii ) corresponding to the generalized pretty good measurements @xcite/ belavkin weighted square root measurements @xcite one can obtain two set of real simultaneous multivariate polynomial equations - the more complicated one of which is essentially an attempt to find the inverse of the mapping @xmath5 given in @xcite , while the other one is much simpler . in ( i ) and ( ii ) each set of real simultaneous multivariate polynomial equations have a discrete solution set of which a subset corresponds to m - element povms and of that a proper subset corresponds to the optimal povm .",
    "the other povms have a physical interpretation : they are the stationary points of the objective function in the space of extremal m - element povms .",
    "when m = 2 , there are only two possible solutions i.e. two such stationary points - one corresponding to the global minima and the other corresponding to the global maxima ; and one is obtained from the other by interchanging indices of povm elements of the latter .",
    "as soon as m=3 , there can be multiple stationary points in the space of extremal povms some of which could be local maxima , local minima , saddle poitns , points of inflection , the global maxima and minimum etc .",
    "thus all this information is encoded in equations .",
    "given this nature of the solution set , it is unlikely that one can find a set of simpler equations to solve the problem .",
    "add to this the problem that the set of reals is not algebraically closed i.e. real polynomial equations can have complex solutions .",
    "thus often some solutions in the solution set are complex which then do nt correspond to any povm .",
    "one of the methods we used to obtain these equations suggests a way to analyze the analytic properties of the optimal povm as a function of the ensemble i.e. to analyze how ensemble varies when the ensemble of li pure states is varied .",
    "these ensembles are parameterized using their gram matrices . for studying the analytic behaviour ,",
    "we employ the implicit function theorem which tells us that the optimal povm will vary analytically as the ensemble is varied according to some parameterization . using ift",
    "we obtain a set of first order non - linear coupled differential equations using which we can `` drag '' the optimal povm from some enseble to another .",
    "we employ rk4 to drag the optimal povm from an equiprobable orthogonal ensemble of states to a general linearly independent ensemble .",
    "we note that the error increases slower than expected with the number of iterations telling us that this method is reliable to obtain med for some li pure ensemble upto desired accuracy .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : first we go into detail about what med is .",
    "then we give the optimizing conditions and specify what they look like for li pure ensembles .",
    "then we give a brief description on li pure ensembles .",
    "we formulate the med problem for linearly independent states using geometry of the qutrit state space and later in what we call the gram matrix method . in both cases",
    "we come across simultaneous real multivariate polynomial equations which have a zero dimensional variety but mutliple solutions .",
    "we note that while some of the solutions are complex and discardable the others correspond to some rank - one projective measurement and infer that all of them are stationary points of the objective function in the space of rank - one projective measurements . moving on",
    ", we find a way to represent linearly independent ensembles using an equivalence class of trace one positive definite matrices and use that along with the implicit function theorem to show that the optimal povm will vary analytically as a function of the ensemble .",
    "then again using ift we obtain a set of first order non - linear coupled differential equations which can be used to drag the solution from one ensemble to another . starting with an equiprobable orthogonal ensemeble we employ rk4 to do this `` dragging '' and we note that we get a decent performance where the errors remain below expected .",
    "a has a device that prepares a quantum state , @xmath6 with probability @xmath7 from a fixed set , @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "let supp@xmath11 , rank@xmath12 . also , let @xmath13 span@xmath14 and dim@xmath15 .",
    "a obtains a quantum state @xmath6 with probability @xmath7 from this device and gives this state to b without telling the latter which state he s being given .",
    "b knows that this state is from a s device and wants to know which state a has given him . for",
    "that a has to `` distinguish '' the state he s been given from the other ones in @xmath16 by performing a measurement on his state .",
    "this measurement is usually a generalized measurement i.e. a povm .",
    "the measurement scheme is as follows : this measurement has m distinct outcomes each of which are indexed in such a way that the ith outcome indicates that he has been given @xmath6 .    in case the states @xmath17 are pairwise orthogonal i.e. @xmath18 , b can choose his povm to be @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a projector on the subspace @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "in such a case @xmath23 leading to _ always _ correct inference and we say that elements from the ensemble can be distinguished perfectly .    in case the states @xmath24 are nt pairwise orthogonal ( as is usually the case ) there is no measurement that can distinguish perfectly between them .",
    "this means that it may so happen that despite being given @xmath6 , b s measurement output is j , leading to an error .",
    "the average probability of error is given by :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 represents an m element povm with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the average probability of success is given by :    @xmath29    both probabilities sum up to 1 :    @xmath30    it is worth noting that @xmath31 ( and @xmath32 ) is a linear function of the m - element povm @xmath26 and that the set of m - element povms form a compact convex set . from it immediately follows that maximization of @xmath31 over these m - element povms implies the minimization of @xmath32 over the same .",
    "@xmath33    thus b s task is finding the optimizing m - element povm .",
    "given that the set of m - element povms forms a compact set , we know that such an m - element povm must exist .",
    "thus b s task is an optimization problem over a constrained set @xmath34 . to every constrained optimization problem ( called the primal problem )",
    "there exists a corresponding dual problem which provides a lower bound ( if primal problem is a constrained minimization ) or an upper bound ( if the primal problem is a constrained maximization ) to the quantity being optimized in the primal problem . under certain conditions these bounds are tight implying that one can obtain solution for the primal problem from its dual .",
    "we then say that there is no duality gap between both problems .    for med",
    "there is no duality gap and the dual problem can be solved to obtain optimal povm .",
    "this dual problem is given as follows @xcite : @xmath35    also the optimal m - element povm will satisfy the complementarity slackness condition :    @xmath36    now summing over @xmath37 in and using the fact that @xmath28 we get :    @xmath38    from we get    @xmath39    was derived by holevo , separately , without using the dual optimization problem . and are equivalent to each other .",
    "these are necessary but not sufficient conditions .",
    "the solution set contains a finite number of m - povms of which a proper subset is optimal .",
    "this optimal povm will satisfy the global maxima conditions given below :    @xmath40    thus the necessary and sufficient conditions for the m - element povm to globally maximize @xmath31 is are given by and .",
    "whatever has been said till now applies to the minimum error discrimination for any ensemble of states @xmath41 . from here on we wish to examine minimum error discrimination of linearly independent pure states i.e. the ensemble is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a linearly independent set .",
    "this implies that @xmath44 and that @xmath45 .",
    "hence the space is now m - dimensional .",
    "continuous optimization problems generally yield two differnt kinds of conditions both of which need to be solved : the first one correspond to stationary conditions of the objective function in the space of feasible solutions and @xmath46 i.e. the space of m element povms . ] .",
    "these conditions are in the form of equations .",
    "the second correspond to the minimization or maximization of the objective function .",
    "these conditions are in the form of inequalities .",
    "one could adopt two different approaches for solving the problem at hand : ( i ) solve both the stationary and the extrema conditions simultaneously .",
    "( ii ) first solve the stationary conditions .",
    "typically , the solution set of the stationary conditions will be discrete .",
    "having obtained this solution set , test each solution individually for the maxima/ minima conditions .",
    "let s interpret what the equations and mean when the ensemble is that of linearly independent pure states .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that in this context , imply that the elements of the povm have to be rank - one .",
    "thus the povm comprises of m rank - one elements and covers a space that is m - dimensional .",
    "this implies that the povm has to be a rank - one projective measurement .",
    "thus we can restrict the candidate set to the space of rank - one projective measurements .",
    "what does imply further ?",
    "it can be easily shown that are conditions for the stationary points of the objective function @xmath31 in space of rank - one projective measurments .",
    "this describes fully the role played by in the optimization problem .",
    "once has been satisfied by some rank - one projective measurements , is the condition for the global maximum of @xmath31 on them .",
    "it has to be noted that this is different from the local maximum condition which would nt be sufficient for med .    solving optimization problems by ( i ) is more difficult than ( ii ) , even numerically .",
    "here we attempt to solve it analytically for the case where @xmath47 and ensemble is real.@xmath48 we try solving the problem through both ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "( i.a ) the med of many general families of ensembles of qubit states can be solved using the qubit - state space geometry @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we investigate what the problem looks like for med for linearly independent pure states in the qutrit state space .",
    "as can be expected , the richness of the qutrit space geometry makes the problem a lot more difficult .",
    "the advantages that the qubit space geometry has to offer , owing to its simplicity and ease of visualization , are lost when it comes to the qutrit space . and give us some polynomial equations and inequalities .",
    "given these equations and inequalities one proceeds by first solving the equations and then testing the inequalities with each element in the solution set .",
    "thus while we started with the intention of solving by ( i ) we ultimately have to resort to solve by ( ii ) .",
    "one can formulate the problem in other means as we will describe below .",
    "those equations are much simpler to solve .",
    "the reason why we made these equations explicit is to give the general picture of how complicated the problem can become for even simplest systems .",
    "( i.b ) staring from and , we reformulate the problem adopting a representation in a special basis . here",
    "we encounter some simultaneous non - linear equations .",
    "these equations are nt polynomial equations but can be manipulated to obtain polynomial equations . yet one loses certain information through these manipulations.some of the information lost pertains to the global maxima conditions . hence the new polynomial equation we obtain give us solutions for the stationary points among which one uniquely will correspond to the global maxima . since the non - polynomial equations are more tedious to solve , it is better to opt for the polynomial equations . once again , despite starting out to solve through ( i ) , we resort to solving through ( ii ) .",
    "( ii)the polynomial equations from ( i ) are very complicated .",
    "one desires much more simplified equations .",
    "the representation just used implies that one can obtain close cousin of equations to those obtained in ( i.b ) which are much simpler to solve . for real systems",
    "are cast into a set of 3 simultaneous real trivariate polynomial equations with a discrete solution set .",
    "given that @xmath49 is nt an algebraically closed field , this discrete solution set may include some complex solutions which are discarded .",
    "each one of the remaining solutions is real and corresponds to a rank - one projective measurment where @xmath31 is stationary is stationary in the space of rank - one projective measurements . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath31 can not be stationary in the space of m - povms .",
    "this is because @xmath31 is linear in the m - povms and space of m - povms is convex",
    ". had @xmath31 been stationary at any point in the m - povm space , it would have to be constant for all points in the space .",
    "we know that this isntrue . ] . of these stationary points , a unique one is the global maximum whereas the others correspond to saddle points , points of inflection , local maxima , local minima and the global minimum .",
    "each one of these solutions has to be individually tested for .",
    "obtaining solutions for these polynomial equations implies solving them symbolically . as we will see later ,",
    "this is a very difficult task to accomplish .",
    "the geometry of the generalized block sphere @xmath50 for qutrits was completely specified in @xcite .",
    "here we go through it briefly :    any density matrix @xmath51 has a unique representation :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 represent the gell - mann matrices and @xmath54 represent a vector from @xmath55 which satisfy the following properties :    @xmath56    is the condition for @xmath51 to be non - negative whereas where @xmath57 specifies the boundary and interior of @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath58 correspond to bloch vector @xmath59 which saturates both and .",
    "for @xmath60 to correspond to a set of linearly independent vectors , we require that @xmath61 lies strictly in the interior of @xmath62 i.e. let @xmath63 , then @xmath64 . here",
    "we do nt impose the condition that @xmath58 be real .    from",
    "and we know that the operators @xmath65 are positive semidefinite with kernel spanned by one dimensional supp@xmath66 .",
    "we rewrite @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "hence @xmath69 is a rank two density operator . since @xmath70 are rank 1 they are extreme points on the boundary of the bloch sphere .",
    "let bloch vectors corresponding to @xmath69 be @xmath71 and for @xmath70 be @xmath72 .",
    "it follows that    @xmath73    @xmath74    consider @xmath75    where @xmath76 and hence we get    @xmath77    now @xmath72 is a function of @xmath71 . since @xmath71 satisfies @xmath72 has to satisfy the following equation linear in its components :    @xmath78    guarantees that there is a unique solution of for @xmath72 and this solution automatically obeys .",
    "that said this functional dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath71 is extremely complicated .",
    "now @xmath79    the polytope formed by the points @xmath80 and @xmath81 in @xmath55 are congruent .",
    "in fact , the latter is a displaced mirror image of the former .",
    "@xmath82    we also require that the identity should be resolved by the states orthogonal to @xmath69 ( i.e. @xmath70 ) .",
    "one of the main hurdles faced in the qutrit case is to * visualize * where @xmath72 should be located so that @xmath83 is satisfied .",
    "also , one needs to satisfy . in the qubit case",
    "@xmath69 would have been a rank - one pure state impling that @xmath71 would be on the surface of the bloch sphere and @xmath72 would be the former s corresponding anti - podal point .",
    "these simplicities are no more in the qutrit case . in general",
    "there are multiple set of states @xmath84 for which some @xmath85 can be found so that and are satisfied .",
    "the problem now is to ensure that too is satisfied .",
    "the only way one can proceed is to solve the the system of @xmath86 unknowns @xmath87 for , , and , where @xmath71 is given by , algebraically .",
    "eqrefsb , and are all polynomial equations whereas are inequalities .",
    "satisfying these equations gives us the optimal povm @xmath88 .",
    "explicit form of @xmath72 in terms of components of @xmath71 make the polynomial equations really tedious .",
    "it s desirable to obtain a much simpler set of equations . with that in mind",
    "we turn to a new method .",
    "we first talk about the general n - dimensional systems . later on we specialize for n=3 .",
    "we wish to obtain the optimal povm ( which is a rank - one projective measurement ) for med for an ensemble @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a linearly independent set .",
    "let @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath92 form a linearly independent set , there exists a corresponding unique ordered set @xmath93 where @xmath94 such that    @xmath95    let g denote the gram matrix of @xmath92.the matrix elements of g are hence given by @xmath96 since @xmath92 is linearly independent set , @xmath97 .",
    "the gram matrix of @xmath93 is @xmath98 .",
    "any ordered orthonormal basis @xmath99 can be represented as follows :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the positive square root of g and u is an n dimensional unitary matrix .",
    "u captures the unitary degree of freedom of the ordered orthonormal basis .",
    "one can easily check that @xmath102 .",
    "any such an ordered orthonormal basis corresponds to an n - element rank - one projective measurement :    @xmath103    in particular , when @xmath104 we obtain the pretty good measurment associated with @xmath92 .",
    "now consider that one can change the phase factors of the onb vectors by appending a diagonal unitary , @xmath105 on the right of u in where @xmath106 .",
    "this implies @xmath107 .",
    "changing these phase factors does nt change the rank - one projective measurement the basis corresponds to .",
    "if one were to use this rank - one projective measurment for med , the probability of success on average is given by : @xmath108 the terms @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the error probabillity that b s measurement yields j despite a sending him @xmath6 .",

    "for the optimal povm @xmath114 , carlos mochon @xcite showed that @xmath115 corresponds to the optimal rank one projective measurment through the correspondence given by .",
    "then implies that the diagonal elements of @xmath116 have to be non - zero .",
    "also one can use @xmath105 to make these diagonal elements positive .",

    "each of these different sets correspond to different rank - one projective measurements each of which will satisfy the stationary condition . in keeping with the fact that only one povm can be optimal , only one of these rank - one projective measurements satisfy the global maxima condition .",

    "the equations subsume not only but the global maxima conditions .",
    "given the complicated expression of the equations in @xmath136 , one is discouraged from solving these simultaneous equations analytically .",
    "it would be better to undertake the tedious exercise to cast them into polynomial equations by rearranging terms in the equations and squaring and cubing the equations .",
    "this necessarily means that the information of @xmath135 corresponding to matrix elements of the * positive * square root of dgd is lost .",

    "the uniqueness of the optimal povm for linearly independent pure state ensembles implies that only one of these real solutions corresponds to the optimal povm .",
    "the physical significance of the other real solutions is that they provide those points in the space of rank - one projective measurements which are stationary for the function @xmath31 as given by .",
    "how does one identify the solution corresponding to the optimal povm ?",
    "from the previous section we know that the matrix @xmath121 has to be a positive matrix to correspond to the optimal povm .",
    "since @xmath121 and @xmath143 are related by a congruence transformation , the optimal solution in our case must correspond to those values of @xmath154 for which the matrix @xmath143 is positive definite .",
    "the uniqueness of the optimal povm then implies that there s only one solution of @xmath154 for which the matrix @xmath143 is positive definite .",
    "symbolically the reduced groebner basis of the ideal of these polynomials contains 14 different elements .",
    "`` solving '' the system would imply that one has to divide the parameter space into disjoint `` cells '' and specify a regular chain for each such cell@xcite . in doing even this",
    ", one can not be sure if the resulting polynomials will be of degree @xmath155 4 in the main variable in each polynomial ( with respect to some suitable monomial ordering criteria ) .",
    "hence we see that even by restricting ourselves to @xmath47 and a real gram matrix , obtaining a closed form solution for the optimal povm is still very tough .",
    "in this section we analyze the optimal m - povm for med of m linearly independent pure states as a function of the ensemble . to do that we first describe this space of m - element ensembles .",
    "we denote it by @xmath156 and a point @xmath157 in @xmath156 is of the form :    @xmath158    consider the space of pure state ensembles . when elements in @xmath157 are indexed , @xmath157 can correspond to it a gram matrix , g. this gram matrix should be @xmath159 , positive definite and have trace 1 . changing the index - sequence of elements in @xmath157 is equivalent to performing a permuation transformation on the gram matrix . additionally , by changing the phases associated with the pure states in @xmath157 - @xmath160 , the gram matrix transforms under a diagonal unitary transformation .",
    "varying these phases does nt change the state @xmath161 and does nt change the ensemble . yet the gram matrix changes .",
    "thus , for the same ensemble , the corresponding gram matrix can vary upto a complex permutation .",
    "we want a more faithful representation so we define an equivalence class on the set of @xmath159 positive definite matrices with trace 1 .",
    "we denote the quotient space by @xmath162 . to represent elements in @xmath162 we adopt two conventions - ( i ) ( ordering convention ) @xmath163 ; in case of equality , @xmath164 and so on and so forth and ( ii ) ( phase convention , after satisfying the ordering convention ) @xmath165 .",
    "@xmath166    @xmath162 is a convex set .",
    "this fact will come in handy later on .",
    "@xmath167 , @xmath168 a unique gram matrix , @xmath169 corresponding to it .",
    "let this mapping be represented as : @xmath170 .",
    "consider a trajectory in the space @xmath156 :    @xmath171 \\longrightarrow \\mathfrak{e}\\ ] ]    thus @xmath172 represents a point in @xmath156 for @xmath173 .",
    "the function e is well behaved with respect to the variable t. how does @xmath174 vary along this trajectory ? from the definition of @xmath31 ,",
    "i.e. , we see that it is continuous both in the ensemble input @xmath175 and the povm input @xmath176 .",
    "if @xmath174 were to vary discontinuously as t is varied from 0 to 1 , the behaviour of @xmath31 would have to suffer discontinuities as a function of t too .",
    "hence @xmath174 varies continuously as t varies from 0 to 1.corresponding to the map e(t ) we get a similar map : @xmath177 \\ ; \\longrightarrow \\mathfrak{g}$ ] where @xmath178 .    the the set of m - element povms forms a convex set .",
    "a povm is generally an ordered set of m positive operators which sum to the @xmath179 .",
    "convex sum of two povms is given by point - wise addition of ith elements : - @xmath180 and @xmath181 , the ith element of the new povm @xmath182 is the convex sum of respective ith elements from @xmath180 and @xmath181 i.e. @xmath183 .",
    "suppose @xmath180 and @xmath181 are projective measurments .",
    "any convex combination of these projective measurments is a projective measurement iff either if ( i ) @xmath184 ( or @xmath185 ) or ( ii ) @xmath186 .",
    "the optimal povm for linearly independent pure states _ has to be _ an m - element projective measurement .",
    "this implies that the optimal povm _ has to be _ unique .",
    "now as t varies from 0 to 1 how does the optimal povm vary ?",
    "the optimal povm will be an m - element rank one projective measurement , so we can confine our focus on this space itself .",
    "the first thing to notice is that the uniqueness of the optimal povm implies that we , actually , _ can _ define a mapping @xmath187 \\longrightarrow \\mathfrak{v}$ ] such that @xmath188 is the optimal povm for med of @xmath172 .",
    "is @xmath188 continuous in t ?",
    "suppose not ; let there be a jump at some point @xmath189 so that @xmath190 .",
    "since @xmath31 is continuous function in both its ensemble input and its povm input , we require that @xmath191 : a contradiction .",
    "thus @xmath188 has to vary continuously as a function of t.    from we know that v(t ) has to be the pretty good measurement associated with some ensemble of the same states but different a priori probability . at the gram matix level ,",
    "both ensembles are related by @xmath192 where @xmath193 is a positive diagonal matrix such that the positive @xmath194 ( which is positive definite ) has diagonal elements @xmath195 ( see ) .",
    "we can construct v(t ) from @xmath196 using simple arithmetic operations of the matrix elements of the latter(see ) .",
    "thus , if d(t ) and d(t ) g(t)d(t ) vary analytically as a function of t , then so does v(t ) . to inspect if the former is true , we employ the implicit function theorem .",
    "implicit function theorem : let @xmath197 be n functions ( real or complex ) of the independent variables - @xmath198 where the variables @xmath199 , which are n in number too .",
    "let @xmath200 be a point such that @xmath201 .",
    "if the jacobian matrix @xmath202 is invertible at @xmath200 then there exists some open neighbourhood , t , containing @xmath203 : for which there exist open neighbourhoods @xmath204 containing @xmath205 such that @xmath206 can be defined , so that @xmath207 . that is    @xmath208    where @xmath209 .    simply put , the implict function theorem gives sufficient conditions for the variables @xmath210 to implicitly depend on the variable t near some point @xmath211 so that in some neighbourhood of this point @xmath212 is constant in t.    analytic implicit function theorem : furthermore if @xmath213 is an analytic function in the variables @xmath214 then the implicit dependence of @xmath215 on t will be analytic too .    from",
    "we get that :    @xmath216    where @xmath217 is the positive square root of dgd and @xmath218 . in our application of ift",
    ", t is the independent variable .",
    "the implicit variables @xmath219 and @xmath220 are defined as :    @xmath221    the implict variables -@xmath222 are @xmath223 in number . here",
    "these variables are complex , thus @xmath219 and @xmath224 are explicitly taken different .",
    "define f(t ) to be an @xmath159 matrix defined by :    @xmath225    consider the matrix equation :    @xmath226    this the same as .",
    "define a new matrix y(t ) as:@xmath227 where @xmath228 .",
    "hence , we want to the functions @xmath229 to vary implicitly on t in a manner such that the functions @xmath230 .",
    "the jacobian is given by @xmath231 the jacobian matrix is an @xmath232 matrix .",
    "now a matrix is invertible iff it s rows ( or columns ) are linearly independent .",
    "we de - vectorize the rows of the jacobian matrix and bring them in the form of @xmath159 matrices .",
    "if _ these _ matrices ( which are @xmath223 in number ) are linearly independent then that proves that the jacobian is invertible .    define matrix @xmath233 by :    @xmath234",
    "this matrix is of the form :    @xmath235    where the x s are polynomials in the implicit variables @xmath236 and matrix elements of @xmath237 .",
    "while it is reasonable to expect that the matrices @xmath238 are linearly independent ( implying the the jacobian is invertible ) unless we know how the implicit variables behave as functions of t , we ca nt conclude anything about their linear independence for all points in @xmath162 .",
    "this puts us in a cyclic conundrum .",
    "the implicit function theorem provides a sufficient but not necessary condition for the existence of such implicit functions .",
    "that is , there are pathological examples where an implicit function exists even at points where jacobian is singular . in this case , our inability to establish that the jacobian is nt singular at all points @xmath239 is nt a cause for worry .",
    "this is because we know beforehand @xcite@xcite that such an implicit function exists , that it is continuous and furthermore we know that it is globally one - to - one with respect g @xmath240 .",
    "implicit dependence does not exist when a critical point is a bifurcation point . in our case",
    "we know that such a point can not exist . otherwise , we d have two different optimal povm for the same point in @xmath162 . and",
    "we know that this can not happen for linearly independent ensembles .",
    "now that we have dealt with the question of the invertibility of the jacobian we note that the @xmath241 are analytic functions of the variables @xmath242 . thus @xmath243 have to be analytic in terms of t. this piece of information is important because it tells us that the diagonal matrix d(t ) varies analytically with t. and this , in turn implies , as we argued before , that the optimal povm will vary analytically with the ensemble v(t ) .",
    "having established that the optimal povm will vary analytically as a function of the ensemble at all points @xmath244 , we ask the following question : can one * drag * the optimal povm from one ensemble to another by employing some technique ?    for this , first of all , we need a trajectory . using the mapping @xmath245",
    ", one can find a simple trajectory between two ensembles .",
    "let@xmath246 represent the first ensemble and @xmath247 .",
    "let the optimum povm for @xmath246 be known .",
    "that is to say , we know what @xmath248 is .",
    "let @xmath249 be another ensemble and @xmath250 .",
    "we want to obtain @xmath251 .",
    "since @xmath162 is a convex set , one can obtain a simple linear trajectory between them:@xmath252\\ ] ] for any value of @xmath253 $ ] , @xmath254 .",
    "we ve established the trajectory.next we need some differential equations which we use to drag d(t ) from @xmath248 to @xmath251 .",
    "for this employ ift again : take the total derivative w.r.t of the equation for all matrix elements and set it equal to zero.@xmath255this gives us a set of @xmath223 first order coupled ordinary differential equations for the implicit variables @xmath243 .",
    "the form of @xmath256 in terms of @xmath257 is rather complicated and depends on the value of m. as an illustration we write down what @xmath256 look like for m = 2 : @xmath258    here @xmath259 is where the explicit time dependence comes into the equations .",
    "these equations become more complicated as m increases .",
    "these equations are hermiticity preserving i.e. @xmath260 and and @xmath261 for infinitesimal @xmath262 .",
    "the equations give us a way of obtaining the optimal povm by dragging the solution from a point where the solution is known to our desired point where the solution is unknown .",
    "it is worth mentioning how everything fits into the technique .",
    "we start from a point whose solution we know and we drag the solution from one point to another using our trajectory .",
    "this dragging is based on the rule that ( and hence ) is always satisfied , i.e. if at a point @xmath263 we have @xmath264 is satisfied we ask what values for @xmath265 will satisfy at the point @xmath266 . note that , by itself , is merely a necessary condition .",
    "needs to also be satisfied for the required solution . now",
    "how do we know that given a trajectory within @xmath162 the differential equations will preserve the positivity of the matrix f(t ) ?",
    "f(0 ) is positive definite .",
    "let s suppose there is a point , @xmath268 where one of the eigenvalues of f(@xmath268 ) is negative .",
    "that means that there must have been some previous point ( say , @xmath189 at which this particular eigenvalue would have been 0 . from its",
    "implied that the matrix d(@xmath189 ) must also be singular at this point . from t=0 to t=@xmath189 , @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",
    "this implies that for all ensembles from t=0 to t=@xmath189 , solution has been obtained .",
    "examine that as we approach the limit @xmath271 , one of the values of @xmath272 .",
    "such scenarios can only arise when ( i ) @xmath273 .",
    "then at @xmath274 , we just have a set of m-1 states in our ensemble . or ( ii ) the part of @xmath275 that is perpendiculr to other states in the ensembles tends to zero , i.e. @xmath276 . in either case",
    "@xmath277 which implies that g(t ) is nt continuous in @xmath162 .",
    "hence we can conclude that as long as the trajectory is safely within @xmath162 , we wo nt encounter this problem .    we employed this method to obtain solutions for various linearly independent pure state ensembles for cases : m = 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "in all the different cases our starting point was the equiprobable orthogonal ensemble for which the solution is trivial i.e. @xmath278 .",
    "we employed the rk4 method to solve for many unknown ensembles ( generated randomly ) . and in all cases we managed to construct a povm which satisfied and i.e. we construted the optimal povm for this case .",
    "one can obtain the solution with as much precision as desired using rk4 .",
    "for rk4 , the local truncation varies as @xmath279 and the total accumulated error as @xmath280 .",
    "our method gives us a way of measuring the error without having to compare results with other techniques @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the deviation of the rhs from 0 is an indication of how much error has seeped in .",
    "thus we plot hilbert - schmidt norm of the rhs of as a function of the iteration to get an idea of how much error accumulates .",
    "we illustrate with an example when m = 5 .",
    "let the gram matrix of the ensemble be given by :    @xmath281    the interval length is given by @xmath282 and the number of iterations is 1000 .",
    "we plot the log of the hilbert schmidt norm of the rhs of .        _",
    "y- axis : log of hs norm of rhs of , x - axis : no . of iterations .",
    "one can see the gradual increase the norm from @xmath283 when @xmath284 to @xmath285 for @xmath286 .",
    "this shows that the truncation error is   @xmath287 and the total accumulated error is   @xmath288 which shows a pretty good performance for rk4 .",
    "_    from the figure we see that for the first few iterations the truncation error is of order   @xmath289 and over the last few iterations total accumulated error is of order   @xmath290 which is well within the error - performance given by rk4 . for many randomly selected ensembles",
    "the local truncation error is of order   @xmath291 and total accumulated error is of order @xmath292 - again well within the rk4 error margin .",
    "this shows that this method is a reliable method to obtain the optimal povm for linearly independent pure states .",
    "where does the method ? if the ensemble is nearly linearly dependent ( i.e. @xmath293 is _ very small _ or @xmath7 is _ _ very small _ _ ) then the method is likely to fail .",
    "this method generally wo nt work when for linearly dependent ensembles .",
    "three major problems are identified :      from @xcite@xcite we see that for an ensemble of linearly dependent pure states @xmath294 , the ensemble for which the pgm of the former will discriminate optimally is given by @xmath295 satisfying the rule :        our problem is opposite : we need to find the optimal povm given the ensemble . but from the above theorem one can conclude that as one varies the ensemble of states , the optimal povm will not necessary vary in a smooth fashion .",
    "also , the above mapping is nt one - to - one ; i.e. for the same ensemble one can find two or more ensembles whose pgm s will optimally discriminate among the members of the former ensemble .      for linearly dependent pure states , the optimal povm for an ensemble need not be unique . for example the optimal povm for the equiprobable ensemble @xmath299 has two extremal optimal solutions - @xmath300 and @xmath301 and hence any convex combination of these two is also an optimal solution . were this ensemble to lie on a trajectory , the optimal solution of points on one side of this ensemble could be closer to @xmath300 than @xmath301 and vice versa for points on the other side of this ensemble .",
    "this shows that the optimal povm can vary discontinuously .",
    "our technique relies upon casting the problem in a representation that exists only when the states are linearly independent .",
    "the speciality with this representation is that the one can use the implicit function theorem which demands that the number of function @xmath213 and the number of implicit variables @xmath210 have to be equal .",
