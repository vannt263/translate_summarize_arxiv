    "the collective redshifted 21-cm radiation from the individual hi clouds appears as a diffuse background radiation and the source clustering is imprinted as the fluctuations in this background radiation .",
    "future redshifted 21-cm observations are currently perceived to be a very promising probe of the formation and evolution of large - scale structures in the post - reionization era ( bharadwaj & pandey 2003 ; bharadwaj & ali 2005 ; wyithe & loeb 2008 ) .",
    "such observations hold the potential of measuring the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) which is a very sensitive probe of dark energy ( wyithe , loeb & geil 2008 ; chang et al . 2008 ; seo , dodelson & marriner 2010 ; masui , mcdonald & pen 2010 ) .",

    "the owfa operates at a nominal frequency of @xmath14 which corresponds to the redshifted 21-cm signal from a redshift @xmath15 .",
    "measuring the redshifted hi 21-cm power spectrum is one of the major science goals of owfa ( subrahmanya et al .",
    "theoretical estimates ( bharadwaj , sarkar & ali 2015 ) predict that it should be possible to measure the amplitude of the 21-cm power spectrum with @xmath16 of observations using owfa . a more recent study",

    "the complex visibilities are the primary quantities measured by any radio - interferometric array like owfa .",
    "it is important and interesting to directly quantify the hi signal in terms of the expected contribution to the measured visibilities .",
    "ali & bharadwaj ( 2014 ) present detailed predictions for the correlations between the visibilities measured at different baselines and frequency channels expected from the statistical hi signal , various astrophysical foregrounds and the system noise .",
    "similar predictions for the hi signal incorporating non - linear effects are also presented in a more recent paper ( gehlot & bagla 2017 ) .",
    "these theoretical estimates predict that the visibilities measured at owfa will be dominated by astrophysical foregrounds which are expected to be several orders of magnitude larger than the hi signal .",
    "foreground removal ( e.g. ghosh et al .",
    "2011b ) is therefore an important issue for detecting the redshifted 21-cm signal .",
    "the astrophysical foregrounds are all expected to have a smooth frequency dependence in contrast to the hi signal , and most foreground removal techniques rely on this to distinguish between the foregrounds and the hi signal . however ,",
    "the chromatic response of the telescope introduces frequency structures in the foregrounds , and it is necessary to model these and account for these in any foreground removal technique . here , simulations play a crucial role in modelling the impact of various complicated effects like the telescope s chromatic response , calibration ( marthi & chengalur 2014 ) etc .",
    "simulations which incorporate the expected foregrounds , hi signal and also various instrumental and post - processing effects are essential for testing and validating any foreground removal and power spectrum estimation technique .",
    "marthi ( 2017 ) has developed a programmable emulator for owfa , this provides a platform for simulating the visibilities that will be measured at owfa .",
    "the foreground modelling and predictions are presented in marthi et al .",
    "( 2017 ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on modelling the hi signal contribution to the visibilities that will be measured at owfa .",
    "bagla , khandai & datta ( 2010 ) have proposed a semi - numerical technique to simulate the redshifted hi signal .",
    "this uses n - body simulations to predict the locations and masses of dark matter halos , and relies on a prescription to populate the halos with hi .",
    "the same technique has been utilized in subsequent work by khandai et al.(2011 ) , guha sarkar et al.(2012 ) , villaescusa - navarro et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and sarkar , bharadwaj & anathpindika ( 2016 ) .",
    "it may be noted that this technique requires the n - body simulation to have a rather high spatial resolution @xmath20 ( comoving ) in order to resolve the halos which host the hi . in comparison ,",
    "an angular extent of @xmath21 and a frequency spread of @xmath22 respectively corresponds to comoving distances of @xmath23 in the transverse direction and @xmath24 along the line of sight at @xmath25 .",
    "considering the fact that owfa s field of view ( fov ) subtends several degrees on the sky and the bandwidth covers several tens of @xmath26 in frequency , it is computationally prohibitive to implement this technique to directly simulate the signal and calculate the visibilities expected at a wide field array like owfa .    in this paper",
    "we present two different methods to simulate the hi signal and calculate the visibilities expected in observations with owfa . in the first method we use the results of the semi - numerical simulations ( e.g. bagla , khandai & datta 2010 ) to construct an input model for the expected 21-cm power spectrum .",
    "this is used to directly simulate different random realizations of the brightness temperature fluctuations and calculate the visibilities.the hi signal here is assumed to be a gaussian random field .",
    "this method models the hi signal entirely as a diffuse radiation , and is completely oblivious to the discrete nature of the clouds which host the hi .",
    "as noted above , the discrete clouds which host the hi each subtends an angle ( @xmath27 or smaller ) that is much smaller than the angular resolution ( @xmath28 ) of owfa .",
    "the velocity structure @xmath29 of the hi inside the individual clouds , is however well within reach of owfa s frequency resolution ( @xmath30 or smaller ) , and this is expected to have an impact on the observed hi signal .",
    "we have also used a second prescription , which is based on earlier work by bharadwaj & srikant ( 2004 ) , uses a cosmological n - body simulation to generate the matter distribution at the desired redshift . here",
    "we identify each simulation particle with a source that hosts the hi and use this to calculate the expected visibilities .",
    "this technique provides us with the freedom to implement any desired line profile for the hi emission from the individual sources .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper are preliminary , thermal noise and complicated systematics have not been included here .    a brief outline of the paper follows . in section 2",
    "we present the model 21-cm power spectrum that was used to simulate the hi signal , and section 3 provides a brief overview of owfa .",
    "the first ( direct ) simulation technique is presented in section 4 , which also contains the results from this approach .",
    "the second ( particle based ) technique , along with the results , are presented in section 5 .",
    "the results from both the simulation techniques are discussed and summarized in section 6 .",
    "we have used the fitting formula of eisenstein & hu(1998 ) for the @xmath31-cdm transfer function to generate the initial , linear matter power spectrum .",
    "the cosmological parameter values used are as given in ade et al.(2014):@xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",

    "the term @xmath52 arises due to of the effect of hi peculiar velocities ( bharadwaj , nath & sethi 2001 ; bharadwaj & ali 2005 ) , and @xmath53 is the linear redshift distortion parameter , where @xmath54 is the dimensionless linear growth rate .",
    "we currently do not have any observational constraint on @xmath45 for high redshifts .",
    "however , the results from the different semi - numerical simulations , and also an interpolated compilation of @xmath45 values ( padmanabhan , roy choudhury & refregier 2015 ) , indicate that it is reasonably well justified to assume a constant hi bias @xmath55 at wave numbers @xmath56 at the redshift @xmath57 .",
    "we have used this value and @xmath58 for our entire analysis , this corresponds to @xmath59 ( bharadwaj , sarkar & ali 2015 ) .",
    "in this paper we consider the so called `` phase - i '' of owfa ( e.g. ali & bharadwaj 2014 , subrahmanya , manoharan & chengalur 2017a ) where @xmath60 successive dipoles are combined to form a single antenna which gives rise to a @xmath61 element interferometer .",
    "each antenna element has a rectangular aperture @xmath62 of dimensions @xmath63 along e - w and @xmath64 along n - s respectively .",

    "note that the values of @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 assumed here are only representative values , and the actual values in the final implementation of the telescope may be somewhat different .    the complex visibilities @xmath74 measured by owfa will be recorded for every independent pair of antennas for every available frequency channel . for any pair of antennas , the baseline @xmath75 quantifies the antenna separation in units of the observing wavelength . for observation towards the celestial equator ,",
    "the baselines available at owfa are @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the total number of antennas for phase i. there is considerable redundancy in the owfa baseline distribution in that there are many different antenna pairs which correspond to the same baseline .",

    ", the hi radiation from a particular source at a radial distance of @xmath208 will be received at a single frequency @xmath209 which is determined by the cosmology , and the particular source will not contribute to any of the other frequencies . in reality , the hi emission emanating from any astrophysical source will have a spread in frequencies due to a variety of reasons including the thermal line broadening and the bulk motions of the hi gas inside the source .",
    "we include this in the simulation by introducing a line profile @xmath210 associated with each source .",
    "the line profile determines the frequency spread of the redshifted hi 21-cm emission from a particular source , and it is normalized as @xmath211 while the line profile may , in principle , differ from source to source we have here assumed the same line profile for all the sources in order to keep the analysis simple .",
    "it may further be noted that the line profile here has been defined with respect to the observed frequency in the rest frame of the telescope . using eq ( [ eq : b1 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vis1 ] ) and incorporating the line profile , we obtain a relation which allows us to calculate the owfa visibilities corresponding to the simulated particle distribution @xmath212 while we have the freedom of implementing any desired line profile for the hi sources , for the purpose of this paper we have chosen a very simple line profile @xmath213 here we have considered three values of @xmath214 . for @xmath215 every source here is assigned a flat line profile of width @xmath216 , which is also the frequency resolution assumed for owfa , this corresponds to a velocity spread of @xmath217 at the rest frame of the source , which is a reasonable value for the hi velocities inside the individual sources expected at this redshift . for @xmath218 the assigned flat line profiles are of broader width @xmath219 and @xmath220 , which respectively correspond to twice and thrice the frequency resolution of owfa .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] shows the visibility correlation @xmath221 determined from the simulations .",
    "we have run @xmath162 independent realizations of the simulation for which the mean and the standard deviation are respectively shown with points and the corresponding error bars .",
    "we find that for all values of @xmath222 the value of @xmath223 obtained from the simulations is approximately twice the linear prediction for the shortest baseline @xmath174 with @xmath179 .",
    "for @xmath215 the values obtained from the simulations are considerably larger than the linear theory prediction ( solid line ) for all values of @xmath174 .",
    "the simulated values are roughly a factor of @xmath224 times larger than the linear prediction in the baseline range @xmath225 which corresponds to @xmath226 , the deviation between the simulations and the linear theory predictions is found to increase at longer baselines @xmath227 . barring the shortest baseline",
    ", the values of @xmath228 progressively decrease as @xmath222 is increased to 2 and 3 . for @xmath229",
    "the results are still in excess of the linear predictions .",
    "for @xmath230 the results match with the linear theory predictions for @xmath231 whereas the results are below the linear theory predictions for larger baselines .",
    "the deviations from linear theory seen for @xmath232 and @xmath233 can be attributed to a combination of the effect of the finite line width ( eq . [ eq : b3 ] ) and the non - linear evolution of the particle distribution in the n - body simulations ( figure [ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "however , we expect the non - linear evolution to be more significant at the longer baselines , and it is difficult to use these two effects to explain why the shortest baseline shows a larger deviation compared to the other adjacent longer baselines for all values of @xmath222 .    the earlier work ( ali & bharadwaj 2014 ) has shown that the owfa visibilities only respond to the brightness temperature fluctuations @xmath234 , and are insensitive to the mean component @xmath92 .",
    "this however had assumed the flat sky approximation , and the sky was assumed to have an infinite extent .",
    "this however does not hold for the simulations which also assume the flat sky approximation but have a finite sky extent .",
    "the @xmath235 primary beam pattern ( eq . [ eq : pbeam ] ) is now truncated after a finite extent and as a consequence the visibilities all pick up a contribution from @xmath92 .",
    "this contribution could be relatively large for the short baselines , however it is expected to die down at the longer baselines .",
    "we can explain the large deviation at the shortest baseline by attributing it to the mean component @xmath92 that is picked up due to the finite sky coverage .",
    "we note that this problem does not arise in the previous section where the mean component is not included in the simulations .    in order to verify our understanding of the origin of the large deviation at the shortest baseline ,",
    "we have considered a situation where the brightness temperature distribution ( eq . [ eq : fluc ] ) has only a contribution from @xmath92 and the fluctuations @xmath236 have been set to zero .",
    "these simulations were run for @xmath237 only . considering the ratio @xmath238 ( figure [ fig:7a ] ) we find that this falls by approximately three orders of magnitude as we go from @xmath179 to @xmath239 .",
    "the ratio falls even further if we consider longer baselines @xmath240 .",
    "this supports our interpretation that in our simulations the shortest baseline picks up a significant contribution from the mean brightness temperature , however this contamination is not significant at the longer baselines .",
    "figure [ fig:7 ] shows the variation of @xmath241 with @xmath152 for three different baselines .",
    "notice that @xmath241 obtained from the simulations at the shortest baseline saturates at a relatively large value @xmath242 at frequency separations @xmath243 in contrast to the linear predictions which are close to zero in this range .",
    "a similar discrepancy is not seen at the longer baselines where both the simulations and the linear prediction are close to zero for large @xmath152 .",
    "this discrepancy at the shortest baseline also can be explained by the fact that the shortest baseline picks up a relatively large contribution from @xmath92 due to the limited angular extent of the simulations .",
    "this problem does not seem to be significant at the longer baselines , and we have dropped the shortest baseline from the subsequent discussion of this section .    for these simulations we find that it is more convenient to directly study @xmath244 instead of considering @xmath241 to analyze how the visibility correlation behaves as a function of @xmath169 .",
    "figures [ fig : a ] and [ fig : b ] show @xmath244 as a function of @xmath169 for the two values @xmath245 and @xmath246 respectively . we have already seen that for @xmath215 the values of @xmath247 from the simulations are @xmath248 times larger than the linear prediction in the range @xmath249 ( figure [ fig:6 ] ) , and this discrepancy increases at longer baselines @xmath227 . here",
    "we find that for @xmath237 , @xmath247 from the simulations are @xmath250 times larger than the linear prediction at @xmath245 ( figures [ fig : a ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy in @xmath247 is reduced for @xmath229 and the results are roughly consistent with linear theory for @xmath251 .",
    "we further see that the discrepancies are restricted to @xmath165 only for all values of @xmath222 .",
    "the simulations are consistent with the linear predictions for larger values of @xmath152 , except possibly for a slight excess seen at @xmath252 for @xmath229 .",
    "the discrepancy at @xmath165 arises from the line profile @xmath253 .",
    "the hi emission from any individual source in the simulation will be spread across a finite frequency width introducing an excess correlation within the line width ( bharadwaj & srikant 2004 ) . for @xmath215",
    "the line width is the same as the channel width @xmath73 which is why the discrepancy is only limited to @xmath165 and does not extend to larger frequency separations for @xmath237 . for @xmath254",
    "the line width is doubled and its height is halved .",
    "this explains why the deviation from linear theory in @xmath255 drops relative to @xmath215 .",
    "this is also possibly responsible for the small excess that we see at @xmath256 for @xmath254 . for @xmath257",
    "the line width is thrice that for @xmath215 whereas its height is three times smaller .",
    "there is no noticeable excess correlation seen for @xmath257 because of the reduced line height , and the results are consistent with linear theory for all values of @xmath152 .",
    "we next consider a larger baseline @xmath258 for which @xmath244 is shown in figure [ fig : b ] . for @xmath237",
    "we find that the value obtained from the simulations is @xmath250 times larger than the linear prediction for @xmath165 and the simulations are consistent with the linear predictions for all larger values of @xmath152 .",
    "for @xmath254 the discrepancy from the linear predictions reduces in magnitude but it now extends to @xmath259 and @xmath216 . for @xmath257",
    "the result from the simulation falls below the linear prediction at @xmath165 while we have an excess at @xmath260 and @xmath219 . in summary",
    "we find that the magnitude and frequency extent of the deviations from the linear predictions is strongly correlated with the value of @xmath222 which decides the frequency width and height of the emission line from the individual sources .",
    "this leads to a picture where the deviations from linear theory seen in figures [ fig:6 ] , [ fig:7],[fig : a ] and [ fig : b ] can be largely attributed to the effect of the line profile of the individual sources . in the present analysis we are unable to identify any noticeable signature of he non - linear evolution of the underlying dark matter distribution .",
    "finally we note that the good agreement between the simulations and the linear predictions found at the long baselines for large frequency separations confirms the fact that the longer baselines do not pick up a significant contribution from @xmath92 .",
    "in this paper we present two different methods for simulating the redshifted hi 21-cm visibility signal expected in observations with phase i of owfa .",
    "the first method directly generates random realizations of the brightness temperature fluctuations @xmath93 corresponding to the input model power spectrum @xmath38 at @xmath261 ( eq . [ eq : temp_pow ] ) .",
    "these simulations treat the hi signal entirely as a diffuse radiation and ignores the fact that the hi actually resides in discrete clouds .",
    "further , it also assumes that the redshifted 21-cm radiation is a gaussian random field whose properties are completely described by the power spectrum @xmath38 calculated using linear perturbation theory .",
    "the second method uses a cosmological n - body simulation to generate a @xmath25 particle distribution .",
    "we identify these particles as the discrete sources that host the hi .",
    "this method allows us the freedom to assign any desired line profile to the hi emission from the individual sources .",
    "it also captures the non - linear evolution of the density field . for the present work we have used a simple line profile where each source is assigned an uniform line width .",
    "the simulations were done for three different line widths @xmath262 which respectively correspond to @xmath263 in our model for the line profile .",
    "the simulated visibilities , in both cases , are a random signal . we have considered the two - visibility correlation @xmath244 to analyze the results of the simulations and compare them with the predictions of linear theory .",
    "as expected , we find that the first method faithfully reproduces the predictions of linear theory . for the second method",
    ", we find that the visibilities at the shortest baseline pick up a relatively large contribution from @xmath92 possibly due to the limited sky coverage of the simulations .",
    "the visibilities at the longer baselines are not significantly contaminated by a contribution from @xmath92 .",
    "we consider two long baselines , @xmath264 respectively in order to analyze the results of the second method .",
    "we find that the results from the simulations show discrepancies from the linear theory predictions .",
    "these discrepancies are restricted to @xmath152 values which are comparable to or smaller than the frequency width of the line profile , and the simulations are consistent with linear theory at larger @xmath152 .",
    "the magnitude of the discrepancy depends on the width of the line profile , and for @xmath215 we find an excess over the linear predictions at @xmath265 .",
    "the magnitude of this excess comes down when @xmath222 is changed from @xmath266 to @xmath267 .",
    "we interpret this as arising from the fact that height of the line profile is halved when @xmath222 is changed from @xmath266 to @xmath267 .",
    "we find that the simulations fall below the linear theory prediction at @xmath165 for @xmath257 . in this case",
    "the increased line width possibly smears out some of the correlation , and the line height is also further reduced .",
    "in conclusion we note that simulated data generated using the methods presented in this paper will play an important role in validating the owfa data analysis pipeline .",
    "simulated data will also play an important role in correctly interpreting the observed signal once a detection is made . in this work",
    "we find that it is important to take into account the discrete nature of the coulds .",
    "the line profile of the individual clouds play an imprtant role in shaping the statistical properties of the redshifted 21-cm signal at small frequency separations which are comparable to the line width of the emission from the individual clouds .",
    "we note that similar results have been reported in an earlier paper ( bharadwaj & srikant 2004 ) . for the present work we have used a rather simplistic line profile , we plan to incorporate more realistic models for the line profile in future work .",
    "further , the impact of the discrete nature of the hi sources depends on @xmath198 the number density of clouds which has been set arbitrarily to @xmath201 which corresponds to the particle number density in the simulation .",
    "we plan to consider more realistic mass distribution schemes in future work .",
    "the current work reveals that the flat - sky paradigm adopted here fails to correctly model the visibilities at the shortest baseline , and it is necessary to implement the spherical sky in order to correctly handle this .",
    "this is also expected to be important for owfa phase ii which will have a much larger field of view .",
    "we plan to also address this in subsequent work .",
