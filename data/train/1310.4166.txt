    "[ fraction](a ) the fraction of cooperators @xmath8 within both groups in dependence on the probability to form between - group links @xmath6 for different topologies of group a. without loss of generality , the topology of group b is initially ( before between - group links are formed ) always regular . it can be observed that , regardless of the topology of group a , there exists an intermediate value of @xmath6 at which @xmath8 is maximal .",
    "the biggest rise compared to the base value obtained for independent groups ( @xmath9 ) is obtained when the topology of group a is regular , followed by the random and scale - free topology . especially for the late case the marginal improvement is expected , given that scale - free networks alone provide a very favourable environment for the evolution of cooperation @xcite .",
    "panels ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fraction ] depict the fraction of cooperators separately for players with and without between - group links when group a has regular , random and scale - free topology , respectively ( see figure legend ) . as for the overall fraction of cooperators , looking at @xmath8 separately for players with and without between - group links",
    "preserves the existence of an optimal values of @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , @xmath8 peaks at roughly the same value of @xmath6 for players with and without between - group links , only that for the former the base - line value of @xmath8 is higher .",
    "it can thus be concluded that players with between - group links are more likely to cooperate than players without between - group links .    further supporting these observations are results presented in fig .",
    "[ groupfc ] , which show the fraction of cooperators @xmath8 in dependence on @xmath6 separately for groups a and b ( see figure legend ) . as in fig .",
    "[ fraction ] , we consider group a with regular , random and scale - free topology in panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively , while the topology of group b is always regular . it can be observed that the bell - like shape of the @xmath8 versus @xmath6 dependence stems mainly from the group b , i.e. , the group where players severe their in - group links to use them for forming between - group links . in group a , on the other hand , @xmath8 simply increases with increasing @xmath6 for the regular [ panel ( a ) ] and random [ panel ( b ) ] topology , or remains practically unchanged for the scale - free [ panel ( c ) ] topology . since between - group links are added to the existing in - group links forming group a , the increase in @xmath8 can be understood as a consequence of the increase of heterogeneity of the interaction network of group a. indeed , the positive role of heterogeneity ( diversity ) for the evolution of cooperation is firmly established , both for games governed by pairwise interactions @xcite as well as for games governed by group interactions @xcite . in case group a is characterized by the scale - free topology , however , the addition of between - group links can hardly elevate the heterogeneity , and thus there @xmath8 remains practically constant regardless of the value of @xmath6 [ see fig .",
    "[ groupfc](c ) ] .",
    "the situation in group b is different , as there the existing in - group links are removed to be substituted by between - group links .",
    "effectively the regular topology of group b becomes more and more diluted as @xmath6 increases , and indeed this may give rise to a bell - shaped outlay of @xmath8 versus @xmath6 .",
    "the role of dilution , albeit by removing players rather than links , has recently been studied in @xcite , and it was reported that such bell - shaped dependencies are indeed very much characteristic on diluted lattices .",
    "notably , in fig .  [ groupfc ] the bells for group b differ since the links are not simply removed , but rather rewired to players that form group a. from there the support for cooperation differs depending on the topology of group a , which of course influences the outcome of the evolutionary process also in group b.    from results presented in figs .",
    "[ fraction ] and [ groupfc ] it follows that links , especially between - group links , play a crucial role by the spreading of cooperative behaviour across interdependent groups .",
    "intuitively , it can be argued that in - group links are responsible for the transmission of cooperation within each group , while between - group links help to spread cooperation also past the boundaries of individual groups .",
    "but which links are more important , and which are more likely to contribute to an efficient spread of cooperative behaviour ? to determine the role of the two types of links more accurately , we introduce @xmath10 as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ explain](a ) .",
    "if a links connects two cooperators @xmath11 . if a link connects two defectors @xmath12 . and finally , if a link connects a cooperator and a defector @xmath13 . in this way",
    "we obtain a proxy for the role links play , and by averaging the value of @xmath10 over all the in - group and between - group links in the system , as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ explain](b ) , we obtain a better understanding of their relevance .",
    "results presented in fig .  [ explain](c ) show how @xmath14 varies in dependence on @xmath6 , separately for between - group and in - group links ( see figure legend ) .",
    "expectedly , given the definition of @xmath10 , the dependence is bell - shaped with the maximum occurring at the same value of @xmath6 as the maximum of @xmath8 in fig .",
    "[ groupfc](b ) [ where group a has random topology as used also in fig .",
    "[ explain](c ) ] .",
    "more importantly , it can be observed that between - group links are more likely to connect cooperative pairs than in - group links .",
    "thus , between - group links appear to be crucial for the spreading of cooperative behaviour across interdependent groups . further adding weight to this statement are results presented in fig .",
    "[ explain](d ) , where the probability to cooperate in the next round is depicted in dependence on the number of cooperative neighbours , separately for players with and without between - group links ( see figure legend ) .",
    "it can be observed that the probability to cooperate is higher for players that have between - group links than it is for players without between - group links , especially if the player has only one , two , three of four cooperative neighbours .",
    "we thus conclude that between - group links are indeed more likely to link two cooperators than in - group links , and that they are in fact more crucial for the spreading of cooperative behaviour .",
    "these findings are in agreement with the recent empirical observations in the hadza camps @xcite , where it was observed that there is high between - group and low within - group variation in public goods game donations , and that the links between camps are more likely between people who do cooperate than between those who do not . the fact that players with more cooperative neighbours are in general more likely to cooperate in the next round , as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ explain](d ) , also agrees with the observations of traulsen et al .",
    "@xcite , who reported the same behaviour in the realm of human strategy updating in evolutionary games .",
    "what is remarkable in our case is that this probability is higher for players with between - group links than it is for players without between - group links .",
    "lastly , we present in fig .",
    "[ colormap ] colour maps encoding the overall fraction of cooperators in both groups in dependence on @xmath6 and @xmath7 , thus obtaining a more comprehensive insight as to the relevance of between - group links under differently severe social dilemma conditions .",
    "the outcome depends quite significantly on the topology of group a. if the topology is regular , as is the case in panel ( a ) , there exists an optimal value of @xmath6 only for @xmath15 , while for @xmath16 the impact of between - group links is predominantly negative .",
    "if the topology of group a is random , on the other hand , there exists an optimal @xmath6 irrespective of @xmath7 , i.e. , even if the conditions for cooperation are relatively favourable , although the optimal value of @xmath6 shifts towards lower values as @xmath7 increases . for group a having scale - free topology",
    "the impact is rather negligible regardless of @xmath7 , as discussed already above when presenting results in figs .",
    "[ fraction ] and [ groupfc ] . in conclusion , these results show that significant advantages of group interdependence are to be expected only when the conditions for the evolution of cooperation are harsh , and when isolated groups alone are hardly able to keep defectors at bay .",
    "it is then that between - group links can do wonders in channelling cooperative behaviour from one group to another , and in doing so strengthening cooperative behaviour in each of them beyond the limits imposed by isolation .",
    "summarizing , we have studied the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner s dilemma game on interdependent groups having different interaction topology .",
    "we have shown that there exists an optimal probability for a player in one group to severe an in - group link and use this to establish a between - group link with one randomly selected player from another group .",
    "this conclusion is largely independent of the topology of the two groups , although it can be observed best if groups initially have either regular or random topology .",
    "if the initial topology is scale - free , the positive impact of the scale - free topology alone @xcite precludes significant improvements in the level of cooperation that would be due to group interdependence .",
    "if the initial topology is regular or random , however , notable positive effects stem from the dilution of links in one group and the addition of new links to the other group , although the former effect in general proves to be stronger ( for related work see @xcite ) . we have also shown that players who have between - group links are more likely to cooperate than players without between - group links , and that between - group links are indeed more likely to link two cooperators than in - group links .",
    "these findings resonate with recent empirical observations in the hadza camps @xcite , where it was observed that these camps exhibit high between - group and low within - group variation in public goods game donations , and that the links between camps are more likely between people who do cooperate than between those who do not .",
    "our findings also agree with previous theoretical research focusing on the evolution of cooperation on interdependent networks , where it has been shown , for example , that the coupling of the evolutionary dynamics in each of the two networks enhances the resilience of cooperation , and that this is intrinsically related to the non - trivial organization of cooperators across the interdependent layers @xcite .",
    "it was also reported that biased utility functions suppress the feedback of individual success , which leads to a spontaneous separation of characteristic time scales on the two interdependent networks @xcite .",
    "consequently , cooperation is promoted because the aggressive invasion of defectors is more sensitive to the deceleration .",
    "even if the utilities are not biased , cooperation can still be promoted by means of interdependent network reciprocity @xcite , which however requires simultaneous formation of correlated cooperative clusters on both networks .",
    "altogether , these results point to the fact that interdependence , be it between groups or other organizational entities , can be exploited effectively to resolve social dilemmas .",
    "yet too much interdependence is not good either ",
    "there must also be sufficient independence for the individual networks to remain functional if the evolution of cooperation in the other network goes wrong .",
    "groups are initially constructed either with a regular topology where each player is connected to its @xmath17 nearest neighbours , or with a random topology where each player is also connected to @xmath17 other players , yet the latter are selected randomly from within each group , or with a scale - free topology according to the algorithm proposed by barabsi and albert @xcite .",
    "we adopt a systematic approach , going from simple to complex interaction topologies , in order to be able to understand and interpret the results at various levels of interdependence .    for convenience ,",
    "we denote the two groups as group a and b , and we introduce a probability @xmath6 according to which each player in group b is allowed to sever one of its in - group links to form a between - group link with one randomly chosen player from group a. the constrain is , however , that no player is allowed to have more than one between - group link .",
    "when all players from group b have had the chance to form between - group links , we arrive at the final interaction network consisting of two interdependent groups , whereby the level of interdependence in determined by @xmath6 .",
    "the whole procedure is depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] .",
    "note that for @xmath9 the two groups are independent , while for @xmath18 they effectively act as one as all the players from group b will be linked with all the players from group a.    after constructing the interdependent groups , we start monte carlo simulations of the evolutionary dynamics with uniformly distributed cooperators and defectors , each thus occupying 1/2 of both groups",
    ". the accumulation of payoffs @xmath19 follows a standard procedure .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the prisoner s dilemma game is characterized by the temptation to defect @xmath0 , reward for mutual cooperation @xmath1 , and punishment @xmath2 as well as the sucker s",
    "payoff @xmath3 equalling @xmath4 .",
    "two cooperators facing one another acquire @xmath20 , two defectors get @xmath2 , whereas a cooperator receives @xmath3 if facing a defector who then gains @xmath21 .",
    "the elementary games steps are as follows .",
    "first , a player @xmath22 is randomly selected from either group , and it acquires its payoff @xmath19 by playing the game with all its neighbours , including those connected via in - group as well as those connected via between - group links .",
    "next , one randomly chosen neighbour of @xmath22 within either of the two groups ( thus could be connected via an in - group or a between - group link ) , denoted by @xmath23 , also acquires its payoff @xmath24 in the same way .",
    "lastly , if @xmath25 player @xmath22 attempts to adopt the strategy @xmath26 from player @xmath23 with a probability @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the larger of the two degrees of players @xmath22 and @xmath23 . this rule is applied instead of the more commonly used fermi rule @xcite to avoid an unequal intensity of selection for players with different degrees .",
    "presented results were obtained by using a regular topology with @xmath29 for group b , and either a regular , random or scale - free topology with @xmath30 ( average degree in latter case ) for group a. players in group b were then allowed to severe one of their in - group links and form a between - group link with probability @xmath6 .",
    "the size of individual groups varied from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , and we confirm the reported results being robust within this interval . for smaller group sizes ,",
    "however , averages over more independent realizations are needed to obtain statistically consistent simulation results .",
    "we have made up to @xmath33 independent simulation runs lasting up to @xmath34 full monte carlo steps , during each of which all players received the chance once on average to adopt the strategy of one of their neighbours .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that exchanging the topologies of groups a and b or varying the degree @xmath17 does not qualitatively change the presented results and the main conclusions .",
