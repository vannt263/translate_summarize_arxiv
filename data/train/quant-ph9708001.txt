    "in this paper we are concerned with the question of how a condensate of two - level atoms interacts with a single resonant quantized cavity mode of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the system can be realized by placing the trap containing the condensate in a microwave cavity .",

    "although for the existing condensates the trapping potential is different for states having a different magnetic quantum number we assume for simplicity that the trapping potential is the same for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this situation may be realized by using non - magnetic traps or by exposing the atoms to a highly detuned laser beam . if the shape of the beam is appropriately chosen the induced dipole - potential can compensate for the difference between the trap potentials .    under these conditions",

    "the quantities @xmath18 are connected to the scattering lengths for the scattering between atoms in the internal states @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ htilde ] ) is formally equivalent to that used to describe parametric down conversion in nonlinear optics ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this system @xmath36 destroys a photon of the pumping beam and @xmath37 and @xmath38 create a signal and an idler photon , respectively .",
    "the interaction between the different modes is caused by a nonlinear medium and describes the process that a pumping photon is converted into two other photons under conservation of energy .",
    "theoretically the pumping beam is often considered as a classical field . to be short",
    "we will focus in the following on the interpretation of the hamiltonian ( [ htilde ] ) as an interaction between two - level atoms in a cavity . though the physical interpretation is different our results",
    "can immediately be applied to parametric down conversion if one considers @xmath39 as the number operator for pumping photons .",
    "a trilinear hamiltonian has been examined numerically by walls and barakat @xcite .",

    "an exact solution for a fixed number of atoms was given in a non - closed form by tavis and cummings @xcite .",
    "our aim is to present a new analytical method for solving the underlying operator equations . in particular this",
    "will then enable us to describe for the system given above the long - time behaviour of the mean occupation @xmath40 of the excited atomic mode for the case that initially all atoms are excited and there are zero photons in the cavity and to confront it with the time dependence of its variance . to do",
    "so we want to give closed - form approximate analytical solutions for @xmath40 for different initial states of the condensate like atomic number state , coherent state , or mixture .",
    "this will allow us to demonstrate that @xmath40 shows a periodic behaviour or the existence of collapse and revival , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ htilde ] ) leads to two conserved quantities : the total number of atoms @xmath41 and , because of the rotating - wave approximation , the number of excitations @xmath42 .",
    "because any two of the number operators @xmath43 can be expressed by the third and the two conserved quantities , it suffices to solve the heisenberg equation for only one of the three number operators .",

    "introducing the new time variable @xmath45 and considering the heisenberg equation for @xmath44 as well as for @xmath46 where the derivative is taken with respect to @xmath47 , one easily finds ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "this fact seems to prevent the integration of the second order differential equation to an equation of first order as it is usually done with differential equations for ordinary functions . a common way to circumvent",
    "this difficulty is the _ vanishing variance approximation _",
    ", where a differential equation for @xmath54 is derived under the assumption that the variance @xmath55 defined by @xmath56 is negligible . here and in the following the mean value of an operator @xmath57 will be represented by a bar , @xmath58 .",

    "( [ 2ndorder ] ) .",
    "they showed that it is valid for short times only and can be applied only to a very limited class of physical problems .",
    "our objective is to improve this scheme : we want to go a step further and derive differential equations for the mean value @xmath60 as well as for the variance @xmath55 and study the respective long time behaviour for different states of the condensate .",
    "because of @xmath61 , the discussion of @xmath62 needs the knowledge of @xmath63 and therefore the exact integration of the operator equation ( [ 2ndorder ] ) .",
    "this can indeed be done by observing that the commutator between @xmath44 and @xmath53 is given by @xmath64 = \\tilde{h}/(i\\hbar \\omega)$ ] so that @xmath65 follows , what can be used to integrate eq .",
    "( [ 2ndorder ] ) to @xmath66 here @xmath67 is a constant of motion which after some algebra can be written as @xmath68 .",
    "it is therefore related to the conservation of energy and particle numbers .",

    "although eq .",
    "( [ 1stdgl ] ) can not be exactly integrated because @xmath67 does not commute with @xmath44 , we are now able to treat @xmath54 together with @xmath55 if we make the two following assumptions of a _ vanishing asymmetry approximation _ : ( i ) the conserved particle numbers are always uncorrelated to the number of excited atoms so that @xmath69 holds for @xmath70 and any integer @xmath71 .",

    "( ii ) we can always neglect @xmath73 so that @xmath74 can be approximated by @xmath75 .",
    "accordingly , in contrast to the vanishing variance approximation , we only assume the vanishing of the higher moment @xmath73 in the hierarchy of moments @xmath76 of the probability distribution .",

    "the physical reason for this simplification is that the interaction conserves the total number of atoms .",

    "note that the expression ( [ coh ] ) is identical to the mean value for a statistical mixture of number states with poissonian statistics .      whereas @xmath106 for a number state shows a periodic behaviour with period @xmath108 it is an important consequence of eq .",
    "( [ coh ] ) that a coherent atomic state as initial state leads to collapse and revival in the number @xmath116 of excited atoms ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "this is also the case for a statistical mixture . leaving open the question if a condensate can at all be described by a coherent state ( compare , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) an experimental verification of collapse and revival can not be used to discriminate between coherent state and mixture .",
    "we turn to the details of the time development of @xmath117 .",
    "the time @xmath118 when the first ( large ) revival occurs can be determined by the criterion given in ref .",
    "@xcite : the expression @xmath119 must simultaneously have a maximum for the two neighboring values @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "this guarantees that many terms in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ coh ] ) become simultaneously large .",
    "since cn@xmath93 is periodic this condition becomes a condition on the argument of the jacobian elliptic function , namely @xmath122 and @xmath123 with an integer @xmath124 .",
    "this can be solved for @xmath124 and @xmath118 and results to leading order in @xmath111 in @xmath125 according to its derivation the revival time @xmath118 is independent of the probability weights of the mixture or state when it is expanded in @xmath126 .",
    "it is therefore the same for all mixtures with the same initial mean number of excited atoms .",
    "in addition to the large revival at time @xmath118 there are many smaller revivals at earlier times which arise at fractions of @xmath118 ( see fig .",
    "these fractional revivals have been predicted numerically for the degenerate parametric oscillator in refs .",
    "the fractional revivals arise when only a part of the sum terms in eq .",
    "( [ coh ] ) have simultaneously a maximum .",
    "their revival times can be calculated by assuming that the terms for @xmath127 and @xmath128 are simultaneously maximal .",
    "this leads to @xmath129 . since the revivals reappear",
    "periodically one generally finds them at fractions of small integers of the time @xmath118 .",
    "an estimation of the almost constant value @xmath130 taken by @xmath131 between the collapse and the first revival can be derived under the assumption that the arguments of cn@xmath93 of eq .",
