    "@xcite gamow imposed an `` outgoing wave boundary condition '' on the solutions of the schrdinger equation for an alpha - particle trapped in the nucleus .",
    "since there is only an _ outgoing _ flux of alpha - particles , the wave function @xmath0 must behave far from the nucleus as ( for simplicity , we consider an s - wave)@xcite @xmath1 this boundary condition , together with the requirement of finiteness of the wave function at the origin , gives rise to a quantization condition on the values of @xmath2 ( and , therefore , on the values of @xmath3 ) .",
    "it turns out that such values are complex : @xmath4 it follows that @xmath5 thus , if @xmath6 , the probability of finding the alpha - particle in the nucleus decays exponentially in time .",
    "the lifetime of the nucleus would be given by @xmath7 , and the energy of the emitted alpha - particle by @xmath8 .",
    "although very natural , this interpretation suffers from some difficulties .",
    "how can the energy , which is an observable quantity , be complex ?",
    "in other words , how can the hamiltonian , which is a hermitean operator , have complex eigenvalues ? also ,",
    "the eigenfunctions are not normalizable , since @xmath9 positive implies @xmath10 positive and , therefore , according to ( [ 3 ] ) , @xmath11 diverges exponentially with @xmath12 .    in spite of such problems ( which , in fact , are closely related )",
    ", it is a fact of life that alpha - decay , as well as other types of decay , does obey an exponential decay law , with a rate close to that obtained using gamow s method .",
    "why this method works is the question we try to answer in this paper in a very elementary way.@xcite thus , in section [ ii ] , we show gamow s method in action for a very simple potential .",
    "some of the results obtained there are used in section [ iii ] , where we study the time evolution of a wave packet initially confined in the potential well defined in section [ ii ] .",
    "this is done with the help of the propagator built with normalizable@xcite eigenfunctions , associated to real eigenenergies . as a bonus ,",
    "we show that the exponential decay law is not valid for very small times or for very large times .",
    "this is the content of section [ iv ] , where the region of validity of the exponential decay law is roughly delimited .",
    "another topic we address in this paper is decay at finite temperature .",
    "this is done in section [ v ] , where we study , with the help of an exactly solvable toy model , how the decay of a metastable system is modified when it is coupled to a heat bath .",
    "it is shown that , under suitable conditions , the decay is exponential , with a decay rate @xmath13 given by the thermal average of the @xmath9 s , @xmath14 although this result appears to be rather obvious , in fact it is not : the decay of a metastable system is an intrinsically non - equilibrium process and , so , there is no a priori reason for the decay rate to be given by ( [ 3.5 ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ vi ] , we discuss the concept of `` free energy of a metastable phase , '' a point where we think there is some confusion in the literature",
    ".    the results and ideas presented here are not really new , but discussions on these matters usually involve the use of sophisticated mathematical techniques , such as functional@xcite or complex analysis .",
    "for this reason , we have tried to make the presentation as clear as possible by resorting to very simple systems and elementary techniques  in fact , techniques that can be found in any standard quantum mechanics textbook.@xcite",
    "in order to exhibit gamow s method in action , we shall study the escape of a particle from the potential well given by : @xmath15 motion in the region @xmath16 is forbidden because of the infinite wall at the origin .",
    "the positive dimensionless constant @xmath17 is a measure of the `` opacity '' of the barrier at @xmath18 ; in the limit @xmath19 , the barrier becomes impenetrable , and the energy levels inside the well are quantized . if @xmath17 is finite , but very large , a particle is no more confined to the well , but it usually stays there for a long time before it escapes . if @xmath17 is not so large , the particle can easily tunnel through the barrier , and quickly escape from the potential well .",
    "metastability , therefore , can only be achieved if the barrier is very opaque , i.e. , @xmath17 is very large .",
    "for this reason , we shall assume this to be the case in what follows and , whenever possible , we shall retain only the first non - trivial term in a @xmath20 expansion .    to find out how fast the particle escapes from the potential well , we must solve the schrdinger equation @xmath21 @xmath22 is a particular solution of this equation , provided @xmath23 satisfies the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath24 denoting the regions @xmath25 and @xmath26 by the indices 1 and 2 , respectively , the corresponding wave functions @xmath27 @xmath28 satisfy the free - particle schrdinger equation : @xmath29 since the wall at the origin is impenetrable , @xmath30 must be zero ; the solution of eq .",

    "the role of the heat bath is played here by the quantized electromagnetic field ; it is the coupling of the atom to it that causes the excited states of the atom , otherwise stationary , to decay to the ground state . even for a highly excited atom ,",

    "as already argued , the excited states would depopulate much sooner than the `` ground state , '' and so the decay rate would be very insensitive to the temperature of the heat bath .",
    "finally , we would like to make a brief digression on a point where we think there is some confusion in the literature .",

    "one should not confuse@xcite this `` free energy '' with the true equilibrium free energy , @xmath182 .",
    "another possible definition of the `` partition function inside the well '' is inspired in the complex eigenenergies of gamow s method : @xmath183 this definition , although almost identical to ( [ 70 ] ) , presents a new and interesting feature : the free energy @xmath184 of the metastable phase is complex ! its real part is essentially equal to @xmath181 , and so has thermodynamical content , but its imaginary part provides dynamical information : if the @xmath9 s are small , it is easy to show that @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the thermal average of the @xmath9 s , as defined in ( [ 50 ] ) . that is the reason why definition ( [ 71 ] ) is so popular in the literature , although it is no more fundamental than definition ( [ 68 ] )",
    "in section [ iii ] we showed that decaying states , although plagued by the exponential catastrophe , give a fairly good description of the decay of a metastable state , provided some conditions are satisfied . in fact , the main result of this paper is that one can compute the decay rate solving the time independent schrdinger equation subject to the `` outgoing wave boundary condition , '' eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "this is far from being a trivial result , since the corresponding eigenstates are nonphysical .",
    "the `` effectiveness '' of the decaying states in describing the decay may be understood by noticing@xcite that they are good approximate solutions to the time - dependent schrdinger equation , although nonuniform ones ( i.e. , they are not valid in the entire range of values of @xmath56 and @xmath175 ) .",
    "in section [ v ] we examined another `` well known '' result , that the decay rate of a metastable system in contact with a heat bath is given by eq .",
    "( [ 50 ] ) .",
    "although we have used a very simple toy model to discuss this point , we believe it contains the essential physics of the phenomenon , at least in the two limiting cases we studied in some detail .",
    "the important lesson to be learned here is that eq .",
    "( [ 50 ] ) is correct ( at least in first approximation ) , provided the condition of `` overdamping '' is satisfied.@xcite at low temperatures , where only the lowest lying decaying states take part in the process , it is an easy matter to verify if it is so .",
    "however , as the temperature increases , decaying states of higher energy are excited and begin to play an increasingly important role in the overall decay .",
    "since the decay rates @xmath9 become larger with @xmath57 , the overdamping condition eventually fails to be satisfied by states actively involved in the process of decay .",
    "thus , one should expect deviations from the decay rate given by eq .",
