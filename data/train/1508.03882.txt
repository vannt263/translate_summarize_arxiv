    "computational models of any biological substance are , by nature , prone to error .",
    "the source of this error can range anywhere from discrete representations of continuous data , to inadequate sampling of the parameter / search space , computational approximations , or even not sufficiently capturing all relevant aspects of the biological system . in some cases",
    ", these errors are slight or insignificant , but when the errors combine  as they frequently do for computations that involve geometry and complicated ( linear or non - linear ) numerical system  they can create a result that is unreliable .",
    "modeling of protein structures and their interactions is a field of research that is especially susceptible to cascading errors , for various computed quantities of interest ( qois ) .",
    "these computations include multi - step methods for protein sequence alignment and homology modeling , implicit solvation interfaces ( aka molecular surfaces ) generation , configurationally dependent binding affinity calculations , molecular docking and structure refinement via molecular substructure replacement and fitting , etc . @xcite . for each and all of these computations related to molecular structure prediction , and energy estimations , the confidence in our results",
    "could necessarily be bolstered , if each estimation of a qoi in the computational pipeline also includes rigorous evaluation of their uncertainty .",
    "such uncertainty bounds , when presented through intuitive visualization would be invaluable in rational design and analysis in molecular modeling tasks .",
    "consider the task of computationally predicting the correct folded structure of a protein and its binding interaction with a partner ( e.g.  an antibody or a small molecule ( or ligand))- a common exercise is drug design .",
    "typically a researcher would first try to identify if the structure is already available in the protein data bank ( pdb ) or the electron microscopy data bank ( emdb ) . while atomic resolution models ( where locations of each atom is clearly reported as xyz coordinates ) exist for many proteins and protein - ligand complexes , in most real applications",
    ", one needs to resolve the structure for a new complex . sometimes partial structures or structure for some components of an assembly is available , and the remaining parts need to be resolved either experimentally or computationally . experimentally resolving such structures are time consuming , costly , and sometimes impossible due to the flexible nature of the molecules in question . in which case",
    "computational modeling is the only option .",
    "such computational modeling tasks are typically expressed , in a mathematical sense , as an optimization problem over a high dimensional configuration space .",
    "the configuration space @xmath0 is parameterized by the available degrees of the freedom for the molecules .",
    "we shall explore two separate parameterization , cartesian coordinates and internal coordinates , in the methods section . for any given parameterization",
    ", the computational task involves sampling the space @xmath0 , evaluating a function @xmath1 at each sample , and reporting the optimum of the function .",
    "the accuracy of the predicted optimum hinges upon a number of factors including the quality of the initial state or input structures to the system , the computational and numerical errors accumulated due to discretization and approximations adopted in the implementation of the scoring function , the dispersion and discrepancy of the sampling etc . , resulting in a high degree of uncertainty on the predicted model / structure .",
    "current modeling and prediction protocols often address uncertainties in an indirect way by reporting several models ranked under some metric with the hope that at least one of the predicted models is close to the truth .",
    "however , it is not clear how to ascertain the quality or confidence on individual models of the list , and also there is no statistical guarantee that a near - accurate model is present in the entire list .",
    "protocols for computing specific properties of molecules like surface area , interface area , binding free energy , etc . sometimes provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation errors due to computational approximations , discretization etc . , but does not address the inherent uncertainty of the input itself .",
    "careful practitioners understand that even high quality models derived from x - ray crystallography have uncertainties in the reported atomic coordinates , expressed using b - factors or temperature factors which is correlated to the standard deviation of the reported coordinate ; models from electron microscopy also has reconstruction uncertainties attached to each voxel of a 3d scalar field ( fig [ fig : pb - uq]a ) .",
    "current visualization and modeling tools ( for example , pymol @xcite , chimera @xcite , coot @xcite , jmol @xcite etc . )",
    "allow one to visualize these uncertainties using color maps on the atoms , smooth surface and the scalar field ( or volume ) .",
    "however , they fail to highlight the functional relevance of these uncertainties . for example , if the qoi is the optimal conformation of a ligand when its binds to a particular protein found using computational means ( typically by finding the minima of a scoring function ( fig [ fig : pb - uq]c ) ) , the uncertainties of the atoms near the binding site would have a higher effect on the qoi .",
    "we developed visualization techniques that reflect exactly how the uncertainties of different atoms affect the qoi .",
    "see figure [ fig : pb - uq]b for example .",
    "this new visualization provides functionally important information about the molecule and helps the users direct their focus to more significant sets of atoms , and thereby guiding any rational design effort .",
    "visualization has to be tied to specific qois and their interpretation and relevance to the users . in this article we present several relevant , quantitative and easy to interpret new visualization techniques and enhance some existing ones to aid each step of a typical molecular modeling pipeline .",
    "at the first step , when one is trying to ascertain the quality and correctness of existing structures , current tools only allows one to visualize the uncertainties in the xyz coordinate values of a single existing model ( fig [ fig : pb - uq]a ) .",
    "we have developed visualizations which summarizes uncertainties from multiple structures / models of the same protein or fragment available in the pdb , to highlight not only the magnitude of uncertainties in cartesian coordinates , but also uncertainties in the torsion angles for internal coordinates ( see methods ) as well as expected principle directions and magnitudes of motion for the atoms . for protein complexes , we also highlight the parts of the structure which belongs to the interaction site .",
    "these visualizations immediately expose the uncertainties in the parameter space and also allows the user to choose a subset of parameters to sample during optimization ( see figures [ fig : torsions ] and [ fig : modes ] ) .    in the next stage ,",
    "given the available degrees of freedom , one needs to sample and explore the configurational space @xmath0 .",
    "we have developed an extension of pseudo - random number generators for high dimensional spaces which guarantees low discrepancy sampling using a set @xmath2 of @xmath3 samples from @xmath0 where @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of degrees of freedom and @xmath6 is a constant ( see appendix ) . by ensuring low discrepancy , and by definition low dispersion , we guarantee that at least one sample @xmath7 is close to the goal structure @xmath8 .",
    "the sampling comes with quantification of the dispersion , as well as two separate visualization techniques to visually verify the coverage of the samples ( see figure [ fig : sampling ] ) .",
    "the same pseudo - random sampling idea is also applied to bound the uncertainty , arising from uncertain input coordinates , or uncertainties from the previous stage of modeling , in computed scoring functions @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , given a single configuration @xmath9 , the parameterization of @xmath10 may include uncertainties which should be propagated to the calculation of @xmath11 ( see figure [ fig : torsions ] ) .",
    "additionally , we developed quantification visualization techniques to highlight the sensitivity of @xmath1 localized to specific atoms / regions of @xmath10 ( see figures [ fig : surfaceuq ] and [ fig : energyuq ] ) , which aids in adaptive sampling of the space .    finally , once the user is satisfied with the quality and robustness of the calculation of @xmath1 , as well as the exploration of @xmath0 , s / he can confidently rely on the computational protocol to derive meaningful biological insights . in this article , we present three different use cases relevant to drug design along with accompanying visualizations . in drug design ,",
    "one is typically interested in finding the best drug that would inhibit an unwanted protein - protein interaction , by binding at the same site ( and blocking it ) .",
    "we show how one can apply probabilistic binding site analysis to screen multiple drug candidates and identify the best lead ( see figure [ fig : bindingsite1 ] ) . given specific targets , and drug candidates ( ligands ) , one typically want to optimize their specificity and binding free energy .",
    "we show how a similar probabilistic binding site analysis can lead to identifying the conformation of the target which shows the highest specificity of binding at the expected site ( see figure [ fig : bindingsite2 ] ) .",
    "finally , we developed visual queues which highlight the relative qualities of multiple ligand conformations ( see figure [ fig : bindingsite3 ] ) .        along with identification of important features and attributes",
    "whose uncertainty need to be visualized as well as designing intuitive modes of visualization , an important challenge is to rigorously and efficiently compute provable uncertainty bounds in the first place .",
    "much of the prior work on identifying and fixing errors that arise from electron cloud disparity has been focused on solving the problem of distinguishing multiple conformations . a very thorough (",
    "although still not exhaustive ) listing of methods providing solutions to this problem has been done by touw _ et .",
    "@xcite , but these methods still seek to identify additional information that can be gleaned from the uncertainty ( such as identifying information beyond the traditional electron density cloud cutoff @xcite , etc . ) , with very few providing certificates or guarantees on the remaining error .",
    "in this article we pose the problem of uncertainty quantification in a statistical framework , identify key sources of uncertainty in molecular modeling , present theoretical bounds on the uncertainties on the computational outcome , and provide a protocol for bounding the effect of uncertainty / error propagated from one stage of calculations to another .",
    "specifically , for each prediction @xmath12 of a quantity of interest ( qoi ) , we provide a certificate of accuracy in the form of a chernoff - like tail bound , i.e. @xmath13| > t ] < \\epsilon$ ] , where @xmath14 $ ] is the expectation of the true value and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are two constants . for several biophysical quantities of interest ,",
    "the underlying random variables need not be independent owing to correlations . in such cases , we relax the assumption on the random variables to being martingales .",
    "the correct analogue of the chernoff - hoeffding bound is the azuma inequality .",
    "most stochastic processes can be formulated as a doob martingale and the azuma inequality applied to such a martingale becomes what is known as the mcdiarmid s inequality . in the appendix of this article",
    "we show how such bounds can be computed theoretically for functions expressed as summation of pairwise distance dependent kernels ( e.g. the van der waals potential ) .",
    "theoretical tail bounds under the mcdiarmid model often tend to be too conservative ( capturing the worst possible case ) .",
    "however , in practice , empirical analysis using monte carlo sampling of the uncertainty space can lead to an approximation of the distribution of the values for the qoi , whose expectation can be used to estimate the tail bounds .",
    "this framework was applied to empirically estimate the uncertainties in the computation of surface area ( sa ) , volume , internal van der waals energy or lennard - jones potential ( lj ) , coulombic energy ( ce ) , and solvation energy under both generalized born ( gb ) and possion - boltman ( pb ) models for single molecules ; as well as interface area , and binding free energy calculation for pairs of bound molecules .",
    "see appendix for details on the energy functions .",
    "we developed scripts and tools which implement the mathematical framework of sampling , use the existing tools to compute the qois @xcite , compute uncertainty bounds as well the visualization directives which can be directly loaded into existing molecular , surface and volume visualization software @xcite .",
    "our methods should enable the end user of these tools achieve a more quantitative and visual evaluation of various molecular models for structural and property correctness , or the lack thereof .",
    "molecular structural models are typically parameterized using either a list of their xyz coordinates , or using internal coordinates ( which is a series of bond length , bond angle and dihedral angle ) . in the first representation",
    "the degrees of freedom or the space of configurational uncertainty is related to each coordinate value ; in the latter representation , typically the dihedral angles are the only degrees of freedom since bond lengths and angles are considered constants .",
    "x - ray crystallography experiments reconstruct a 3d electron density cloud from the diffraction pattern generated from a crystal lattice of the molecule . for high resolution reconstructed electron densities , expected locations of individual atoms can be identified .",
    "hence , it is common to report such models using the xyz coordinates of the atoms . however , expected location is not necessarily perfectly determined .",
    "there is a degree of uncertainty which is expressed as temperature factors or b - factors .",
    "simply stated b - factors are a measure of the error in the match and fit of specific atoms within the electron density cloud constrained by the protein s primary , secondary and tertiary structure and inter - atom biochemical / biophysical forces .",
    "b - factors are derived from structure factors , which are based on the fourier transform of the average density of the scattering matter .",
    "the structure factor , @xmath17 , for a given reflection vector , @xmath18 , is the sum of the optimized parameters for each atom type @xmath19 , and position @xmath20 and as defined by the following equation :    @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the scattering factor , @xmath23 is the b - factor for atom @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the 3-dimensional position of each atom @xcite .    if we assume that the static atomic electron densities have spherical symmetry ( or , more specifically defined by a trivariate gaussian , @xmath24 ) , this can be converted into the anisotropic temperature factor commonly used , @xmath25 @xcite :    @xmath26,\\ ] ] where the univariate gaussian form ( needing not the direction of @xmath18 , but only its magnitude ) is described by :    @xmath27 .",
    "\\label{eq : bfactor}\\ ] ]    finally , the b - factor is defined as @xmath28 .",
    "thus , a b - factor of 20 , 80 , or 180@xmath29 corresponds to a mean positional displacement error of 0.5 , 1 , and 1.5 , respectively .",
    "the internal coordinate system , the assumption is that the entire molecule is like a connected graph embedded in 3d space .",
    "each node of the graph is an atom , and each edge represent a bond .",
    "so , given the position of any one atom , and the bond length , bond angle ( angle at a node between two bonds ) , and dihedral angles ( given three successive bonds , the dihedral angle is defined as the angle between the two planes formed by bonds 1,2 and bonds 2,3 ) ; the location of all atoms can be uniquely determined .",
    "moreover , internal coordinates successfully captures the dependence of atom positions on the positions of the neighbors .",
    "also , since bond lengths and angles have been empirically observed to be constants , this representation allows one to reduce the number of degrees of freedom to only the change of dihedral angles ( henceforth called torsion angles since the change is similar to a twisting motion around a bond ) .",
    "one typically defines statistical uncertainty quantification as a tail bound , namely , a probabilistic certificate as a function of a parameter @xmath15 , where the computed value @xmath30 of a qoi expressed as some complicated function or optimization functional involving noisy data @xmath31 is not more that @xmath15 away from the true value , with high probability . or alternatively the probability of the error being greater than or equal to @xmath15 is very small .",
    "such a certificate is expressed as a chernoff - hoeffding @xcite like bound as follows-    @xmath32| > t ] \\leq \\epsilon.\\ \\label{eqn : chern - x}\\ ] ]    for the special case when @xmath33 is a linear combination of the components of @xmath31 , simple statistical attributes like variance , standard deviation etc . of @xmath33 can be computed directly from the variances of @xmath31 , even if the components are not independent . if , @xmath33 is not a linear combination , then an interval approximation ( confidence intervals , likelihoods etc . )",
    "can be computed using a taylor - like expansion of the moments of @xmath33 @xcite .    in this article , we adopt a method of bounded differences , which is a modification of markov and chebyshev inequalities , used for independent random variables to derive chernoff - like bounds .",
    "we briefly discuss the derivation of a loose uncertainty bound based on doob martingales as introduced by azuma @xcite and hoeffding @xcite and later extended by mcdiarmid @xcite .",
    "then we proceed to apply this model to bound the uncertainty in molecular modeling tasks that involve summations over decaying kernels ( e.g. electrostatic interactions ) .",
    "we also extend the applicability of mcdiarmid - like bounds to cases where the random variables are not necessarily independent ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "since theoretical upper bounds often overestimate the error , we also explore an alternate quasi monte carlo ( qmc ) approach@xcite .",
    "the qmc is useful in approximating the distribution of values for the qoi under a given statistical model of the input uncertainty , and then empirically establish the uncertainty of individual values of the qoi , as well as providing certificates like equation [ eqn : chern - x ] .",
    "although the quality of the qmc based certificate itself depends on the quality and size of the samples , our experiments ( see results and discussion ) showed that typically fewer than 200 samples under a low discrepancy sampling techniques provides sufficiently accurate approximations of the certificates .",
    "quasi monte carlo method of uncertainty propagation , it is assumed that @xmath34 are independent random variables and their probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) are known .",
    "now , a low discrepancy sampling of the product space @xmath35 must be generated which would define an approximate pdf for @xmath33 from which we could compute all the necessary tail bounds .",
    "we explore several such product spaces and use low discrepancy sampling strategies to derive pdf s of functions @xmath33 with bounded error and guaranteed convergence .",
    "note that a simpler quasi monte carlo ( qmc ) sampling can be applied to find the minimum @xmath36 for each @xmath37 , and hence derive the overall bound .",
    "hence the most crucial component of uq and up under this qmc framework boils down to identification of the set of independent random variables @xmath31 , which affect the computation of the qoi ( @xmath33 ) , along with their approximate pdfs and corresponding sampling techniques .",
    "the statistical framework described above , requires geometric models of the molecules , parameterization of the degrees of freedom available to the molecule , a mapping which allows one to update the model based on sampled degrees of freedom , and an implementation of the qoi .",
    "this this section , we describe how we derive the relevant degrees of freedom and set up the joint probability distribution which gets sampled by the qmc protocol .",
    "we explore both vibrational / positional uncertainty variables ( from b - factors ) , and flexible / configutational uncertainty variables ( internal torsion angles ) .",
    "given the x - ray structure @xmath38 containing @xmath39 atoms of a protein or a complex of two proteins in the pdb file format , we extract the anisotropic b - factors @xmath40 and @xmath41 for each atom @xmath42 .",
    "the distribution of the position of the atom in each direction is modeled as a gaussian distribution whose pdf is defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the standard deviation derived as @xmath45 from the b - factor , and the mean @xmath46 is the expected position of the atom . note that for some x - ray structures only an isotropic b - factor @xmath47 is reported . in that case",
    "we simply assume @xmath48 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we consider these distributions to be independent consistent with the assumptions made while computing the b - factors themselves .",
    "for the internal coordinates , we have already mentioned that the bond lengths and angles are considered constants .",
    "the dihedral angles are also constant for some specific motifs , like an aromatic ring , or the peptide plane . however , there are still some dihedral angles which are free . for proteins ,",
    "these consists of two angles on each peptide ( a protein is a chain of peptides ) defined as @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as well as zero or more free dihedrals on the side chain of each peptide . for the purpose of this article",
    ", we shall simply assume that a total of @xmath51 such dihedral anlges are free .",
    "we shall express each such degree of freedom using a random variable distributed uniformly between a range @xmath52 $ ] where the limits of the range is derived from the so called ramachandran plot @xcite , which is an empirical study of dihedral angle values observed in protein structures .",
    "note that , the dihedral angle degrees of freedom are truly independent .      the joint distribution , either defined as the product space of the @xmath53 independent gaussian distributions for the b - factor case , or the product space of the @xmath51 independent uniform distributions for the torsion angles with within lower and upper limits defined by ramachandran plots , represents the space of possible configurations for the molecule .",
    "hence , sample the joint distribution , we first sample the space @xmath54^{3n}$ ] using pseudorandom generator which guarantees low discrepancy sampling in high dimensional product spaces @xcite to produce a tuple @xmath55 . for the b - factor case , each number @xmath56 from this tuple",
    "is mapped to get a sample @xmath57 from a normal distribution using the box - muller method @xcite , and finally appropriate translation and scaling is performed to get a sample from the corresponding gaussian distribution as follows @xmath58 .",
    "these samples @xmath59 are used to displace the atoms to generate a new configuration . for the torsion angle case , the @xmath56",
    "is mapped from @xmath54 $ ] to the @xmath52 $ ] range by simple uniform scaling , and then the resulting torsion angles are applied using the denavit - hartenberg transformation @xcite to produce a new geometric model of the molecule . figure [ fig : sampling ] shows an application of the internal coordinates ( dihedral angle ) sampling applied to generate 1000 samples from a poorly configured model of an inhibitory ligand for kb kinase @xmath60 ( pdbid:3qad ) .",
    "a well configured model for the same ligand is already available ( pdbid:2rzf ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : sampling](a ) we have contrasted the bad and good configurations .",
    "the rmsd between the models is 4.667 .",
    "figure [ fig : sampling](b ) shows the 1000 samples we generated . a low dispersion sampling guarantees that at least one sample would be close to the good configuration .",
    "indeed , in figure [ fig : sampling](d ) we show one of the several samples which had low rmsd compared to the good configuration .    an important point to note",
    "is that the above procedure , while maintaining the constraints implied by the b - factors and the mean positions and only making small perturbations , does not necessarily guarantee that the new configurations will be biophysically feasible .",
    "in particular they do not preserve the bond angle and bond lengths .",
    "so , we use the amber force field @xcite and energy minimization with implicit solvents to relax the sampled structures .",
    "we rejected any sample for which the relaxed structure still had high van der waals potential indicating that some atoms are too close to each other .",
    "accepted models were protonated and assigned partial charges based on the amber force field using the pdb2pqr program @xcite .     discrepancy .",
    "note that the y - axis is log - scale , so the number of samples ( @xmath3 ) required for the naive method grows exponentially in @xmath5 ( number of dimensions ) , whereas the pseudorandom method ( prng ) grows as a function of @xmath61.,width=384 ]    one of the major drawbacks with qmc sampling is that the curse of dimensionality prevents naive sampling with a large number of dimensions . assuming that one wants @xmath16 discrepancy for each random variable , which requires @xmath51 samples in a single dimension ( assuming @xmath5 r.v.s , whether from the @xmath53 independent gaussians or @xmath62 torsion angles ) .",
    "then to maintain the same level of discrepancy , the qmc protocol would require @xmath63 samples .",
    "for any reasonable measure of discrepancy ( i.e. @xmath64 ) , this quickly becomes intractable .",
    "for this reason , it is absolutely crucial to use a sampling method that requires a polynomial number of samples . the low - discrepancy product - space sampler developed by bajaj _",
    "@xcite reduces the number of samples significantly from @xmath63 to only @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "note that this is polynomial in @xmath51 and @xmath5 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : prng_vs_native ] for a summary of the number of samples required for different values of @xmath5 and @xmath16 .",
    "with this sampling method , we can produce low - discrepancy bounds without a computationally - intractable algorithm .      while the visualizations in figures [ fig : torsions ] and [ fig : modes ] highlight the inherent uncertainties in the molecular structure and their parameterization , they do not directly highlight the effect of these uncertainties on computed properties of the molecule . specifically , we are interested in bounding the propagated uncertainty in the calculated property , and",
    "also localize the origins of uncertainty which disproportionately affect the outcome .",
    "this is carried out using the statistical qmc framework described above .",
    "we sample an ensemble of structures based on the inherent uncertainties of the model , compute the quantity of interest , compute certificates of accuracy etc .",
    "see results for a detailed quantitative analysis in terms of bounding the uncertainties in computed area , volume , and solvation energies .",
    "now we discuss some techniques which allows one to visually explore such uncertainties .",
    "we propose a visualization where the samples are combined into a single volumetric map whose voxels represent the likelihood ( over the set of samples ) of an atom occupying the voxel .",
    "figure [ fig : surfaceuq](a ) shows such a visualization for 1oph : a .",
    "note that this data is not simply useful for visualization , but can be used as the representation of the shape of the molecule for docking and fitting exercises to incorporate the input uncertainties directly into the scoring functions .          in many applications , instead of a volumetric map ,",
    "one uses a smooth surface model to compute qois like area , volume , curvature , interface area etc . in such cases , a visualization like figure [ fig : surfaceuq](b )",
    "can be very descriptive .",
    "it shows a single smooth surface model ( based on the original / mean coordinates ) , and the colors at each point on the surface show the average distance of that point from all surfaces generated by sampling the joint distribution . unsurprisingly , most parts of the surface in the figure has very low deviation , and only the narrow and dangling parts have high deviation . comparing this with the rendering of b - factors ( in figure [ fig : pb - uq](a ) )",
    "shows that even though some parts of the surface are in regions with high b - factors , the uncertainties does not affect the surface computation as much .",
    "now we focus on qois that are computed based on other intermediate qois .",
    "for example , computation of pb energy first evaluates the pb potential on a volume which encapsulates the molecule and the solvent .",
    "this potential calculation itself requires a smooth surface representation of the molecule as input , along with the positions and charges of the atoms . in this case ,",
    "as well as bounding the overall uncertainty for the final value of the pb energy , we can also bound the uncertainties of the intermediate pb potentials calculated at each voxel .",
    "we do this by defining the pb potential at a voxel as separate qois and apply the qmc sampling to generate an ensemble of atomic models and smooth surfaces , then evaluate the qois for each sample .",
    "hence , we derive a distribution for each voxel .",
    "the means of these distributions are rendered in figure [ fig : energyuq](a ) showing the negative and positive potential regions .",
    "the standard deviations of the distributions are rendered in figure [ fig : energyuq](b ) . comparing the original uncertainties ( b - factors in figure [ fig : pb - uq](a ) ) to these third level propagated uncertainties",
    "shows that while in some regions the uncertainties had a cancellation effect , in some other regions they amplified .",
    "computationally predicting the correct binding site on a given protein for binding with a specific ligand or a class of ligands is an important problem in drug design .",
    "often the goal is the inhibit or prevent a protein a from binding to a partner molecule b. so , one tries to first identify the site on a where b is supposed to bind .",
    "then , one would explore a set of drug candidates and try to find one ( let us call it c ) that would bind to the same site with stronger affinity and thereby prevent b from binding there . in some cases ,",
    "the configurations of both the protein a and the ligand c must be re - resolved in each others presence , to get a more realistic estimate of the binding strength .    typically , protein - protein and protein - ligand binding interactions are computationally predicted by sampling the space of relative orientations ( as well as each one s internal configuration ) to find the optimal orientation .",
    "this procedure is often referred to as docking . however , due to the combined uncertainties of the models , the energy / scoring function calculations , and sampling , one can not simply assume that the highest scoring model out of the docking procedure . here , we show that even if one considers the top @xmath67 results from the docking , then they can be used to define a probabilistic model of the binding site .",
    "this model is robust from spurious results and minor perturbations / errors in the scoring .      given a validated scoring function @xmath1 with bounded errors , specific configurations @xmath68 and @xmath69 of two molecules @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and a low dispersion sampling of the space of relative orientations",
    "@xmath72 , we compute a list of the top @xmath67 ranked orientations . let the @xmath73-th orientation is expressed using a transformation @xmath74 which is applied to @xmath69 ( denoted @xmath75 ) .",
    "now , for each atom @xmath76 on molecule @xmath70 , let @xmath77 denote a random variable denoting the event that @xmath76 is in contact with @xmath69 upon binding ; i.e.  @xmath76 is on the binding site .",
    "now , we define the probability of @xmath78 as follows    @xmath79 = \\frac{1}{k } \\sum_i(contact(a , t_i(s_b)))\\ ] ]    where @xmath80 is 1 if at least one atom in @xmath75 is within a distance cutoff from @xmath76 , otherwise @xmath80 is 0 .    hence , we identify the binding site probabilistically . given an accurate docking tool and molecules in favorable configurations , the probabilities would be high for small contiguous regions of the molecule a , and low in other regions . on the other hand , almost equal probability across the a would indicate poor docking prediction , and/or poor affinity between the molecules .",
    "we explore applications of this analysis and visualization in the next few subsections .",
    "consider the scenario where the configurations of molecule a , and its binding partner b are known ; and we want to select an inhibitor from a set of candidates which would bind to a at the same site as b. without loss of generality , assume that we want to choose between two candidates @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we first compute @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 as described above .",
    "note that we assumed that the binding orientation of a and b is known , hence @xmath83 is either 0 or 1 .",
    "now , we define the quality of candidate u , in terms of its expected ability to block the binding of b , is expressed as follows-    @xmath86    comparing @xmath87 and @xmath88 , one can choose the most likely candidate . we have also developed an intuitive visualization for this scenario , where we delineate the b s binding site on a ( boundary of the regions which have @xmath89 ) , and then color the surface of a using @xmath84 .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : bindingsite1 ] , we explore the efficacy of two antibodies d1d2 and nih45 - 46 in preventing the hiv spike protein gp120 from binding with host - cell s membrane protein cd4 .",
    "it is apparent that nih45 - 46 is a better candidate for inhibiting gp120-cd4 binding .          in many applications",
    "the structure of the target is not complete resolved a - priori .",
    "for example , the expected orientation of 17b and gp120 is known from low resolution data , but the exact atomic configuration of gp120 near the binding region is not known . in these cases",
    "one typically samples the space of possible configurations , select a few which score high according to a scoring function , optimize them and finally determine the best candidate .",
    "however , in this case the quality of the structure depends not only on its own internal energy , but also on the affinity and specificity of its binding to the expected ligand .",
    "probabilistic binding site analysis , as described above , can greatly contribute to the selection in this scenario . in figure",
    "[ fig : bindingsite2](a ) , we show the probability of specific residues ( small collections of contiguous atoms ) of being on the binding site .",
    "now , we couple this with the prior knowledge of the expected binding site of 17b .",
    "a model which has clusters of high probability near the expected binding site definitely offers a better binding interface to 17b , and hence is a better model .",
    "this measure is easily expressed mathematically similar to equation [ eq : bsiteoverlap ] .",
    "the visualizations shown in [ fig : bindingsite2](b)-(c ) provide immediate confirmation and intuition behind the choice . in this figure , we sampled the configuration of the variable regions of gp120 ( which are hard to resolve experimentally ) , and one of the variable regions , called v3 , is especially relevant in binding with 17b . in the figure ,",
    "we see two different configuration of the v3 regions , and one of them ( left panel ) seems to favor or allow 17b to bind at the expected site , and the other seems to block the site a little bit and forces 17b to bind slightly off its expected site .      during ligand optimization for binding",
    ", one needs to sample the configuration for the ligand and then , for each configurations , apply docking to predict the best ranked orientations ( of the sample configuration ) . in such cases ,",
    "we augment the definition of the probability of an atom being on the binding site by summing over all configurations , i.e. @xmath90 = \\frac{1}{kn } \\sum_{s_b \\in \\mathcal{c}^b_n } \\sum_i(contact(a , t_i(s_b ) ) ) \\label{eq : bindingprob2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath91 represents the configurational space of @xmath71 , and @xmath92 is the @xmath3 discrete samples taken from this space .    given this probabilistic estimate of the binding site , we define a new scoring function to rank the ligand configuration+orientations . for a given orientation @xmath74 of a given configuration @xmath69 , we define its score as follows-    @xmath93    hence , configurations of the ligand which can bind at highly probably binding sites , are rewarded .     for binding with an inhibitor ligand .",
    "the ligand atoms are colored by averaging the @xmath94 ( see equation [ eq : bindingprob2 ] ) values of the atoms of the kinase , and colored using the same color transfer map . hence , ligand configuration which has a high proportion of blue , and low amount of red / orange is a better configuration ( the right one in this case ) . ]    a visual representation of equation [ eq : bindingscore ] is shown in figure [ fig : bindingsite3 ] . for this particular example",
    ", we had a correct configuration of a ligand , that inhibits the kb kinase @xmath60 , from the protein data bank model 3rzf , and a wrong configuration of the same ligand from the model 3qad .",
    "we started with the wrong configuration and generated 1000 samples ( see figure [ fig : sampling ] ) and docked each of them using autodock @xcite to the kinase .",
    "the figures show two ligand conformations .",
    "the one on the left had a poor rmsd , 3.24 , with respect to the known correct configuration ( and orientation ) from 3rzf .",
    "the one on the right has a favorable rmsd , 1.069 .",
    "interestingly , both of them received the same score , -8.2 , from autodock .",
    "however , when we computed the @xmath95 for them , the left one scored 55213 , and the right one 55667 , clearly showing the superiority of the latter .",
    "in this section , we detail the results of applying our qmc based uq framework to generate chernoff - like bounds for a set of 57 protein complexes .",
    "additionally , we provide a protocol to determine the number of samples is required to guarantee the accuracy of the empirical certificates for specific proteins .",
    "the results clearly establish the necessity of rigorous quantification of uncertainties , and also shows that such an endeavor need not be prohibitively time consuming .",
    "we applied the qmc approach of empirically bounding uncertainties of computationally evaluated qois to 61 crystal structures including 2 bound chains each .",
    "we took the ` rigid - body ' cases of antibody - antigen , antibody - bound and enzyme complexes from the zlab benchmark 4 @xcite .    for each of the complexes",
    ", we applied the sampling to the receptor and the ligand ( the two chains in the structure ) separately , and evaluated the uncertainty measures for the calculation of surface area , volume , and components of free energy including lennard - jones , coulombic , dispersion , gb and pb . we also computed the uncertainties in the binding interface area , and change of free energy . in the following subsections we explore different aspects of this analysis .",
    "figure [ fig : hist ] shows the distribution of values computed for the sampled models for pdb structure 1oph - chaina .",
    "the red lines in the figure shows that the original coordinates does not always provide the best estimate of the expected value of a qoi .",
    "the z - scores for these structures , with respect to the expected values and standard deviations derived from the empirical distribution , are 0.33 , -0.82 , 1.37 , and 0.25 respectively for area , volume , gb , and pb . this emphasizes the importance of applying some form of empirical sampling to find the best representative model ( one which minimizes the z - score , for instance ) .          in the next section",
    "we discuss the likelihood of producing a large error in the calculation of qoi , due to the presence of uncertainty in the input , in terms of chernoff - like bounds . for each model in the dataset , we computed the distribution , and then computed the probability , @xmath16 , of a randomly sampled model having more than 0.1% , 0.5% , 1% , 2% , 3% , 5% and 10% errors ( @xmath15 ) , where error is defined as @xmath96|/e[x]$ ] such that @xmath97 is the value computed for a random model and @xmath98 $ ] is the expected value ( from the distribution ) .",
    "table [ tab : chernoff ] lists chernoff bounds as described above for the two chains of 1oph .",
    "the rows named @xmath99 represent the quantity @xmath100 computed while keeping @xmath70 fixed and sampling the distribution of @xmath71 ; rows named @xmath101 report the same quantity while keeping @xmath71 fixed and sampling the distribution of @xmath70 .",
