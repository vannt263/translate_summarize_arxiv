    "electrons in spatially separated normal metals in mutual contact with a superconductor show correlations that are evidence of quantum entanglement due to their interaction with the cooper pairs in the superconductor .",
    "@xcite experimentally , the correlations manifest themselves as a nonlocal voltage that develops on one normal metal in response to a current injected from another normal metal into the superconductor .",
    "in such a hybrid structure , three processes that contribute to the nonlocal voltage have been investigated .",
    "two , crossed andreev reflection ( car ) and elastic co - tunneling ( ec ) , arise from the interaction of quasiparticles in the spatially separated normal metals that are mediated by the cooper pairs in the superconductor , and decay spatially on the scale of the superconducting coherence length @xmath0 , typically about 100 nm for al .",
    "@xcite the third process , charge imbalance,@xcite is associated with the conversion of a quasiparticle current into a supercurrent in the superconductor , and decays over the charge imbalance length @xmath1 , which is of the order of a few microns.@xcite none of these three nonlocal processes are expected in a normal metal with an induced superconducting proximity effect , where there is no superconducting order parameter .",
    "consequently , it comes as a surprise that large nonlocal signals can indeed be observed when a quasiparticle current is injected into a normal metal that is proximity coupled to two superconductors .",

    "<S> we report evidence of large , nonlocal correlations between two spatially separated normal metals in superconductor / normal - metal ( sn ) heterostructures , which manifest themselves as nonlocal voltage generated in response to a driving current . unlike prior experiments in sn heterostructures , the nonlocal correlations are mediated not by a superconductor , but by a proximity - coupled normal metal . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocal correlations extend over relatively long length scales in comparison to the superconducting case . at very low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> we find a reduction in the nonlocal voltage for small applied currents that can not be explained by the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity , which we believe is a signature of new long - range quantum correlations in the system . </S>"
