    "quantum dot ( qd ) is a crucial electronic structure in the technological devices  @xcite because of it s unique properties such as zero - dimensional confinement effect  @xcite and single electron charge effect ( coulomb blockade )  @xcite .",
    "there are several methods that have been used to control electron motion in qd system .",
    "one of which is to control the energy levels and the electron concentration in the qd systems using a plunger gate voltage  @xcite . on the other hand , by applying a photon radiation that interacts with the electrons in the qd arising a fascinated physical phenomena called photon - assisted tunneling ( pat )  @xcite .",
    "pat occurs in quantum systems when a photon radiation is applied to an electronic island connected to electron reservoirs  @xcite .",
    "the photon radiation forms extra channels in the electronic island leading to a modification in the electron transport  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the photon radiation can play an essential role in the transport process generating a photo - current that depends on the photon frequency  @xcite .",
    "recently , the influences of photon field , in a vacuum state , on two level electronic system  @xcite , and double quantum dots in the presence of a single mode micro - cavity system with both continuous wave and pulsed excitation are studied  @xcite . based on the proposed schemes , a single photon generation can be obtained separately under both qd - cavity resonant and off - resonant conditions . the single photon source , in turn , becomes increasingly important in the very diverse range of technological applications .",
    "in addition , external magnetic fields can be used to control the electron transport in nanodevices , which leads to several important effective including the change of the energy level spacing inside the qd@xcite and hence the qd lowest energy state shrinks with increasing the magnetic field . as a result , the coulomb interaction between two spin degenerate electron grows  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , external magnetic field can form the edge state  @xcite and the localized state  @xcite in the electronic systems , and consequently , the electron transport is reduced .",
    "the combination of the aforementioned fields , namely the magnetic and photon fields , can result in a magneto - photon current in graphene  @xcite and superconductor  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we have considered magneto - photo transport under the influence of a quantized single photon mode in a cavity and investigated it s effect on electron transport through a qd system . in the presence of the photon cavity ,",

    ", the current is increased in the main peak at @xmath61  mv which attributes to the fact that the charge density is stretched out of the qd as is shown in ( b ) .",

    ", the contribution of photon replica state with two photons can also lead to the enhances the charge current .",

    "are increased and the photon replica states weakly contribute to the electron transport . as a result",
    ", the charge current is decreased in the main peak .",
    "another interesting aspect of this issue is the influence of the external magnetic field on the current in the side peak displayed in ( b ) .",
    "the formation of side peak is totally due to the photon cavity .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the current is high at low cyclotron energy when @xmath86 ( blue solid ) indicating that the photon - induced current should be generated at low magnetic field .",
    "there are two reasons for the high current here : the photon replica states are more active in the electron transport at low cyclotron energy , and the stretching of charge density in the qd system due to the photon cavity .",
    "to explain the enhancement of curent at the side peak , the charge density at @xmath77  mv is shown in for ( a ) the low cyclotron energy ( @xmath64  mev ) , i.e @xmath86 , and ( b ) the high cyclotron energy ( @xmath76  mev ) , i.e @xmath69 . in ( a ) the charge density is mostly distributed outside the qd and near the contact area to the leads .",
    "the charge accumulation in the contact area leads to the stronger charging to the qd system from the leads , and then the charge current at the side peak is increased .",

    "it was found that the cavity forms photon replica states and their contribution to the electron transport can be affected by the external magnetic field . therefore , two different regimes are studied , low and high magnetic fields . at the low magnetic field regime ( low cyclotron energy ) where the cyclotron energy is assuemd to be lower than the photon energy , the photon replica states formed in the presence of the cavity are actively contribute to the transport .",
