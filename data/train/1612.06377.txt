    "the hot big bang model of the universe has many long - standing problems , for example : the horizon , the flatness , and the monopole problems , among others . the inflationary paradigm ( inflation )",
    "was introduced to solve these problems [ @xcite ] .",
    "inflation is a period of accelerated expansion of the universe in early times and in this scenario , the space grows exponentially ( or quasi - exponentially ) fast for a fraction of a second after the big bang .",
    "furthermore , inflation can explain the current temperature fluctuations observed in cmb spectrum and the formation of the large scale structures in the universe [ @xcite ] , and also predicts a nearly scale invariant primordial power spectrum [ @xcite ] .",
    "+ many different models of inflation have been proposed and studied in the literature . in these models inflation",
    "is generically driven by the coupling of one or more scalar fields to gravity ( the so - called inflaton field ) , and the dynamics during inflation is such that generically the potential energy of the fields dominate over their kinetic term and the potential is flat enough to ensure the so - called slow - roll inflation ( for more details about this topic see [ @xcite ] and [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "moreover , the models of inflation with scalar fields are successful because others models with higher spin fields generically induce a spatial anisotropy and the effective masses of such fields are usually of the order of the hubble scale and the slow - roll inflation does not occur [ @xcite ] .",
    "besides of scalar fields models of inflation , in recent years some authors have considered another alternative , suggesting the possibility that the inflation is driven by massive vector fields [ @xcite ] . the vector fields , also have been considered as another alternative to solve the dark energy problem [ @xcite ] . in the reference [ @xcite ]",
    "the authors propose a scenario where inflation is driven by non - minimally coupled massive vector fields and it is shown that in an frw type universe these fields behave in precisely the same way as a massive minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "in addition , the problem with the spatial anisotropy is solved considering a triplet of orthogonal vector fields or for the expense of n randomly oriented vector fields . in this sense",
    ", we propose a general vector - tensor model of inflation which has extra terms coupled to vector fields ( the ricci tensor , ricci scalar and gauss bonnet invariant ) .",
    "this proposal is more general than the studied by [ @xcite ] .",
    "+ this paper it is organized as follows : in section [ sec_model ] we introduce a vector - tensor model of inflation with non - minimally coupled terms to massive vector fields and the corresponding field equations are obtained . in section [ sec_cosmoevol ]",
    ", we consider a flat frw type universe and a vector field with temporal and spatial components , and from these considerations general expressions for equation of motion and the total energy momentum tensor are obtained .",
    "also , in this section we consider suitable values ( or constraints ) of model parameters , and the respective analysis is performed .",
    "finally , some conclusions are exposed in section [ sec_concs ] .",

    "the action eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) satisfies three very important conditions : ( 1 ) the lagrangian density is a four - scalar ; ( 2 ) the resulting theory is metric and ( 3 ) there are no higher than second derivatives in the resulting field equations [ @xcite ] . in addition , to avoid a possible ghost instability of the longitudinal component of the massive @xmath9 vector field in the slow - roll regime , the following condition needs to be satisfied [ @xcite ] @xmath10 nevertheless , in order to decide whether or not this vector model of inflation is perturbatively unstable , the full gravitational and field theory perturbation analysis must be performed .",

    "a similar model was studied by [ @xcite ] in the dark energy context , but without explicit potential terms . a model with vector field coupled to gb invariant and the ricci scalar in a bianchi type - i universe was proposed by [ @xcite ] .",

    "in this section we carry out the analysis related to the early cosmological evolution of the universe generated by the model described in the previous section , taking into account a possible slow - roll inflation regime .",
