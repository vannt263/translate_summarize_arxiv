    "_ in - prep _ )",
    ". however , the power of _ jwst _  is its ability to measure the rest - frame uv to optical spectral energy distributions of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "this wealth of information will facilitate the accurate determination of a range of physical properties , including : redshifts , star formation histories ( and stellar masses ) , instantaneous star formation rates , dust attenuation , morphologies , gas phase metallicities , and kinematics ( and dynamical masses ) .",
    "the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies are made up of intrinsic contributions from stars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) modified by dust and gas in the intervening interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the intrinsic stellar sed of a galaxy depends on the joint distribution of stellar masses , ages , and metallicities combined with stellar evolution and atmosphere models which link these properties to photometric quantities .",
    "more commonly , the joint distribution of stellar masses , ages , and metallicities is expressed in terms of the joint star formation and metal enrichment history and an assumed initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "these are linked to intrinsic seds through a stellar population synthesis ( sps ) model which includes stellar evolution and atmosphere models and typically assumes an imf .    disentangling the various desired physical properties from photometric observations",
    "often involves making a range simplifying assumptions that leaves any inferred property sensitive to these assumptions .",
    "conversely , when attempting to predict photometric properties from galaxy formation simulations similar assumptions must be made , again leaving any predictions sensitive to various choices .",
    "for example , the choice of assumed imf can affect observationally inferred stellar masses and star formation rates by up to @xmath10 ( e.g. wilkins et al .",
    "at very - high redshift ( @xmath5 and above ) the inclusion of nebular emission in sed templates can affect stellar mass estimates by up to @xmath11 where strong lines intersect the relevant broadband filters ( e.g. schaerer & de barros 2009 ; stark et al . 2013 ; wilkins et al .",
    "the choice of sps model has also been demonstrated to affect physical properties inferred from observations and photometric properties predicted by galaxy formation simulations ( e.g. gonzalez - perez et al .",
    "2014 ; wilkins et al .",
    "for example , gonzalez - perez et al .  (",
    "2014 ) found that the bright end of the near - ir luminosity function is particularly sensitive to the choice of model at high - redshift .    in this study",
    "we produce predictions for various photometric properties ( including the uv to near - ir spectral energy distributions , luminosity functions , uv star formation rate calibrations , intrinsic uv continuum slopes , and lyman continuum ( lyc ) photon production efficiencies ) of very - high redshift ( @xmath12 ) galaxies using the bluetides  cosmological hydro - dynamic simulation . in making these predictions",
    "we investigate the implications of a range of different modelling assumptions , including the choice of sps model , imf , and the lyc escape fraction .",
    "this article is organised as follows : in section [ sec : bt ] we describe the simulation and the construction of galaxy spectral energy distributions .",
    "specifically , in ",
    "[ sec : bt.galaxies ] we describe the properties of galaxies within the simulation before describing the modelling of the stellar populations (  [ sec : bt.sps ] ) and the nebular reprocessing (  [ sec : bt.nebular ] ) .",
    "we then present predictions for various photometric properties , including the spectral energy distributions in section [ sec : sed ] , the uv star formation rate calibrations (  [ sec : c ] ) , the intrinsic uv continuum slope (  [ sec : uvcs ] ) , and lyc photon production (  [ sec : lyc ] ) . in section [ sec : conc ]",

    "there are almost 160,000 objects with stellar masses greater than @xmath15 . imposing a limit of @xmath16 means that each galaxy is resolved with at least 118 star particles . ] in the simulation volume and in this work we limit our analysis to those galaxies . the galaxy stellar mass function ( gsmf ) predicted by the simulation is shown in figure [ fig : gsmf ] and closely matches the observational constraints available at @xmath17 ( song et al .",

    "the inset panel shows the number of objects with @xmath19 in the simulation volume as a function of redshift @xmath20 . ]      to determine the photometric properties of galaxies we couple the bluetides simulation with five stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models ; these models are listed in table [ tab : spss ] . throughout most of this work we assume a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function ( imf ) at @xmath21 . however , in  [ sec : sed.imf ] we consider a range of imfs .",
    "the integrated _ pure stellar _ spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each galaxy , @xmath22 refers to the fact that we assume the escape fraction of lyc photons @xmath23 is effectively unity .",
    "] , is determined by assigning the sed of a simple stellar population ( ssp ) to every star particle taking into account their ages and metallicities .    [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the initial mass function ( imf ) describes the mass distribution of star at their formation and as such for a fixed mass of stars the photometric properties depend on the assumed imf ( e.g. stanway et al .",
    "conversely , inferring physical properties from the observed sed requires the assumption of an imf ( see for example wilkins et al .",
    "2008ab ) .    to explore the effect of the imf we consider a number of literature and model imfs described in table [ tab : imf ] using the pegase sps model .",
    "the effect on the broad - band luminosities , relative to assuming a salpeter imf , of reprocessing the simulation assuming these imfs is shown in figure [ fig : lcomp_imf ] .",
    "relative to assuming a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf . ]    adopting an imf with a different low - mass ( @xmath24 ) behaviour but similar high - mass slope ( e.g. the @xmath25 $ ] , kroupa 2001 , and chabrier 2003 imfs when compared to the salpeter imf ) results in a systematic shift of the predicted luminosities .",
    "however , because low - mass stars make a relatively small contribution to the total sed ( in the case of our predicted galaxies ) the shift is fairly uniform with wavelength .",
    "however , changing the high - mass slope ( e.g. the @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 $ ] imfs ) or increasing the maximum stellar mass ( not considered in this work , but see stanway et al .",
    "2015 ) can also affect the luminosities as a function of wavelength .",
    "for example , assuming an imf with a flatter high - mass slope ( i.e. @xmath28 ) increases the relative proportion of high - mass stars ( compared to intermediate - mass stars ) , resulting in a preferential increase in the uv luminosity over the optical and near - ir .",
    "a flatter imf will also increase the number of lyc photons which will enhance the impact of nebular emission .",
    "this is particularly notable in the rest - frame @xmath3-band .        as galaxies evolve through time their average age ( and to a lesser extent metallicity ) increases driving an evolution in the average sed .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : lcomp_z ] where we show the redshift evolution of the specific ( i.e. per unit _ initial _ stellar mass ) rest - frame broadband luminosities assuming the pegase sps model . while the rest - frame uv luminosity per unit _ initial _ stellar mass decreases by @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) from @xmath20 the rest - frame @xmath31-band remains virtually constant .    .",
    "]    the evolving lyc photon production rate also drives an evolution in the strength of nebular line and continuum emission . in figure",
    "[ fig : lcomp_nebular_z ] we show the evolving impact of nebular line and continuum emission on the broadband luminosities .",
    "the impact on the rest - frame @xmath3-band decreases from @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) at @xmath32 to @xmath10 at @xmath1 .    ) on the predicted broadband luminosities as a function of redshift assuming the pegase model .",
    "the figure shows the ratio of the _ total _ emission to the pure stellar emission in each broad - band .",
    "the @xmath3-band ( coloured green ) encompasses the strong h@xmath33 line . ]",
    "there is a strong variation of the average stellar metallicity with stellar mass predicted by the simulation .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : lcomp_mass ] this drives a dependence of sed on the stellar mass , such that the most massive galaxies are intrinsically redder .",
    "once nebular emission is included ( which reddens the sed ) the strength of this trend reduces .",
    "this is a result of the fact that nebular emission preferentially affects the youngest and lowest metallicity stellar populations which are also the bluest .     to highlight the variation across mass bins .",
    "the number @xmath34 is the total number of galaxies contributing to the bin . ]",
    "the rest - frame uv continuum luminosity is a widely utilised diagnostic of the instantaneous star formation activity in galaxies ( e.g. kennicutt 1998 ; kennicutt & evans 2012 ) .",

    "the choice of sps model can result in a systematic shift of approximately @xmath43 ( reflecting the difference in the predicted uv luminosities ) .",

    "robust observations of individual galaxies at @xmath17 and above are typically limited to the rest - frame uv and optical .",
    "although , star formation rates can be estimated from the intrinsic uv the uv is susceptible to strong attenuation by dust . as such observed",
    "uv luminosities only provide lower - limits on the total star formation activity .    while the rest - frame far - ir ( which probes dust reprocessed uv and optical emission ) at high - redshift",

    "we obtain the intrinsic uv continuum slopes of galaxies in bluetides  using a methodology similar to that used by observations at high - redshift by simply using the broadband @xmath55 colour , @xmath56 the factor of @xmath57 comes from the choice of filters .",

    "the high lyc production in the bpass model arises due to the fact bpass predicts more massive stars at late ages due to the modelled effects of mass transfer between binary stars causing rejuvenation , extending lifetimes and resulting in rotational mixing which other codes largely neglect ( see discussion in stanway , eldridge , & becker 2016 and stanway et al . 2014 ) .",
