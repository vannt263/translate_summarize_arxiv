    "whereas cellular automata have been widely used to model complex systems in which the local character of the evolution rule plays an essential role  @xcite , the theory of cellular automata is still in its infancy and very few exact results  as , for example , the necessary and sufficient condition for a cellular automaton rule , either deterministic or probabilistic , to be number - conserving have been obtained  @xcite recently most of the theoretical research carried out into this field is devoted to definition and characterization of new families of rules . in order to extend the family of number - conserving rules a number of papers on monotone rules (",
    "the set of number - conserving rules is a subset of monotone rules ) have been published  @xcite .",
    "the complexity of problems concerning characterizations of these properties may be illustrated by a recent result  @xcite showing that monotony is decidable in dimension one but not in higher dimensions .",
    "this paper is devoted to the study of a new class of cellular automata called _ eventually number - conserving cellular automata _ defined by the property of evolving after",
    "a finite number of time steps to states whose number of active sites remains constant .",
    "the characterization of this new class of cellular automata is challenging since both number - conserving and monotone rules are special cases of eventually number - conserving rules , and it is not , therefore , obvious that eventual number conservation is a decidable property .",
    "a one - dimensional cellular automaton ( ca ) is a discrete dynamical system , which may be defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be a function satisfying the equation @xmath1 for all @xmath2 and all @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the set of all integers , @xmath5 the set of nonnegative integers , and @xmath6 a finite set of states , usually equal to @xmath7 .",

    ", we will only consider finite ( or periodic ) cas , and replace the set @xmath4 by the set @xmath20 of integers modulo @xmath21 .",

    "while number - conserving cas may be viewed as models of isolated systems of interacting particles in which processes of annihilation or creation of particles are forbidden , enc cas are models of open systems of interacting particles exchanging particles with the external world such that at after a finite transient time the numbers of particles moving from and to the system exactly counterbalance each other .",
    "numerical simulations show that the constant number of active sites in configurations of the limit set of an enc ca depend not only upon the initial number of active sites but also on the detailed structure of the initial configuration .    in the two following sections we consider classes of cas that one might think coincide with enc cas . in the last section the _ motion representation _ of ca rules",
    "is introduced .",
    "more explicitly than the usual rule table , it shows how to represent particle motion either inside the system or between the system and the external world , stressing the fact that enc cas can be viewed as systems of interacting particles .",

    "some properties of monotone cas have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "if a ca rule is _ number - nondecreasing _ and _ number - nonincreasing _ , it is _ number - conserving_. the class of number - conserving rules is therefore a subclass of the class of monotone rules .",
    "it is clear that all monotone rules are enc , but have we a theorem stating a necessary and sufficient condition for a ca rule @xmath14 to be monotone ?",
    "the answer is `` yes . ''",
    "it can be shown  @xcite , that    _ a one - dimensional @xmath23-state @xmath15-input ca rule @xmath14 is _ number - nondecreasing _ ( resp . _",
    "number - nonincreasing _ ) if , for all cyclic configurations of lengths @xmath32 _ and _ @xmath33 it satisfies relation  ( [ ndr ] ) ( resp . ( [ nir]))_.    * remark .",

    "say nondecreasing , a rule has to verify relation  ( [ ndr ] ) for all configurations of lengths @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this is , in particular , the case for three - state two - input ca rules .",
    "the sets of rules that satisfy relation  ( [ ndr ] ) for all cyclic configurations of lengths 2 and 3 have , respectively , 864 and 724 elements while the intersection of these two sets contains only 708 ca rules which are the only monotone nondecreasing rules .",

    "the answer is `` no . '' in other words , the class of monotone rules is _ strictly _ included in the class of enc rules .",
    "for example , elementary ca rules 99 , 173 , and 229 are enc but not monotone .",

    "that is , for all @xmath39 and all @xmath40 , @xmath41 _    it would be tempting to define a enc ca rule as a ca rule that emulates , at least , one number - conserving rule . here",
    "are two examples .",
    "* example 1 . *",
    "elementary ca rule 176 , defined by @xmath42 is number - nonincreasing .",
    "one can readily verify that it emulates number - conserving elementary ca rules 184 and 240 ( see top figure  [ fig : pattern176and99 ] ) .",
    "configurations belonging to its limit set consist of isolated 1s separated by sequences of 0s whose lengths depend upon the initial configuration .",
    "* example 2 . * elementary ca rule 99 defined above , which is not monotone , emulates elementary ca rule 226 .",
    "configurations of its limit set consist of alternating sequences of 0s and 1s with , depending upon the initial configuration , either a few pairs of 0s , separating two successive 1s , or a few pairs of 1s , separating two successive 0s ( see bottom figure  [ fig : pattern176and99 ] ) .     _ the spatiotemporal patterns of elementary ca rules 176 ( top ) and 99 ( bottom ) show clearly that these rules emulate , respectively , elementary ca rules 184 and 240 , and elementary rules 226._,title=\"fig : \" ]   _ the spatiotemporal patterns of elementary ca rules 176 ( top ) and 99 ( bottom ) show clearly that these rules emulate , respectively , elementary ca rules 184 and 240 , and elementary rules 226._,title=\"fig : \" ]    in appendix 2 we show how to determine enc ca rules emulating number - conserving rules .",
    "are there enc ca rules that do not emulate a number - conserving rule ?",
    "surprisingly , the answer is `` yes , '' and defining enc ca rules as rules , which after a finite number of iterations emulate number - conserving rules would be inadequate . as for monotone rules ,",
    "the set of rules that emulate a number - conserving rules is _ strictly _ included in the set of enc rules .",
    "for example , elementary ca rules 74 and 88 , obtained by reflection - state @xmath15-input ca rule @xmath43 , defined by @xmath44 is called the _ reflected _ of rule @xmath14 . ] of rule 74 ,",
    "are examples of such rules .",
    "they are defined by @xmath45 and @xmath46 they are not monotone and do not emulate number - conserving rules .",
    "actually , configurations belonging to their limit sets contains all the 8 different triplets .",
    "both spatiotemporal patterns exhibit the propagation in opposite directions of similar structures ( see figure  [ fig : patterns74and88 ] ) .",
    "rules 173 and 229 , defined above , and that are respectively conjugate of rules 74 and 88 , do not emulate number - conserving rules and have spatiotemporal patterns that , like rules 74 and 88 , exhibit the propagation in opposite directions of similar structures .     _ spatiotemporal patterns of elementary ca rules 74 ( top ) and 88 ( bottom ) . both rules",
    " one being the reflected rule of the other  are not monotone and do not emulate number - conservative rules .",
    "initial configurations are random._,title=\"fig : \" ]   _ spatiotemporal patterns of elementary ca rules 74 ( top ) and 88 ( bottom ) . both rules  one being the reflected rule of the other  are not monotone and do not emulate number - conservative rules .",
    "initial configurations are random._,title=\"fig : \" ]    since there exist enc rules that are not monotone and do not emulate any number - conserving one , the union of the set of monotone rules and the set of rules emulating number - conserving rules is _ strictly _ included in the set of enc rules .",
    "the particle dynamics is not clearly exhibited by the ca rule table .",
    "a simpler and more visual picture of the evolution rule can be given by its _",
    "motion representation_. this representation , which has been first introduced for number - conserving rules  @xcite , was defined as follows .",
    "list all the neighborhoods of an occupied site represented by its site value @xmath47 .",
    "then , for each neighborhood , indicate the displacements of the @xmath48 particles by arrow(s ) joining the site where the particle(s ) is ( are ) initially located to its ( their ) final position(s ) .",
    "a number above the arrow indicates how many particles are moving to the final position . to simplify the representation only neighborhoods",
    "for which , at least one particle is moving .",
    "are listed . here",
    "are two examples .",
    "the motion representation of the two - state three - input rule 184 , which represents the simplest car moving rule on a one - lane highway , is @xmath49 since a particle located on the left of an occupied site can not move to the right ( which the direction of motion ) we do not mention it . in a less compact notation we could complete the above representation with @xmath50 the motion representation of the three - state three - input rule 6171534259461 is @xmath51 in both examples particles move only to the right .",
    "it is , therefore , not necessary to indicate the state of the left neighboring site of the particle(s ) .",
    "it is rather straightforward to extend this representation to nonconservative rules .",
    "the only difference with number - conserving rules is to indicate the possibility of creations and annihilations of particles .",
    "this is done by adding either a @xmath52 or a @xmath53 sign above the site state followed by a positive number @xmath15 to represent , respectively , creation and annihilation of @xmath15 particles at that site .",
    "although the number of particles is not conserved , we shall keep the name _",
    "motion representation _ , since creations and annihilations of particles may be viewed as particles moving between the system and the external world . here",
    "are two examples illustrating that enc cas rules can be viewed as evolving systems of particles and not just finite sequences of nonnegative integers obeying abstract transformation rules .",
    "* example 1 .",
    "* the motion of particles in a system evolving according to ca rule 176 is represented by @xmath54 where the symbol @xmath55 may represent either a 0 or a 1 .",
    "the second term shows that only isolated 1s can survive , as illustrated in top figure  [ fig : pattern176and99 ] .",
    "in addition , when no more particles can be annihilated , that is , when all particles have empty neighboring sites , the evolution rule of the system coincides with ca rules 184 and 240 , in agreement with the fact that rule 176 emulates these two rules .",
    "* example 2 . * the evolution of a system of particles evolving according to ca rule 74 is represented by @xmath56 the first term shows that isolated 1s move to the left ( see top figure  [ fig : patterns74and88 ] ) , furthermore , starting from a triplet of 1s in a sea of 0s , the combination of these three terms generates t a composite particle of length 6 oscillating between two states : @xmath57 and @xmath58 propagating to the left , or the two - row composite particle @xmath59 which , then propagates to the left .",
    "note that the motion representation lists only neighborhoods of moving particles , where `` moving '' stands for motion to or from the external world .",
    "we have introduced a new class of cas called _ eventually number - conserving _ ( enc ) cas adopting",
    "the following definition : _ a one - dimensional @xmath23-state @xmath15-input ca rule @xmath14 is _ eventually number - conserving _ if , after a _ finite _ number of iterations , it satisfies the number - conserving condition  ( [ ncdef ] ) for all cyclic configurations of length @xmath24_. enc cas are models of open systems of interacting particles exchanging particles with the external world but that , after a finite transient time , the numbers of particles moving from and to the system exactly counterbalance each other .",
    "the interpretation in terms of particles is emphasized by the motion representation of the ca evolution rule .",
    "we have shown that the set of enc ca rules _ strictly _ includes the set of number - conserving rules , the set of monotone rules , and the set of rules emulating a number - conserving rule .",
    "the set of enc rules also strictly includes the union of all these sets showing that the set of enc rules actually contains rules which do not belong to any of these sets .",
    "this challenging result suggests that the characterization of this new apparently simple class is probably not a trivial problem .",
    "the code numbers of monotone nonincreasing and nondecreasing elementary ca rules are respectively : @xmath60 and @xmath61 there are five number - conserving elementary ca rules given by the intersection of these two sets .",
    "their code numbers are : @xmath62 .",
    "in this appendix we show how to find examples of enc ca rules emulating given number - conserving ca rules .",
    "four - input rule 50358 is number - conserving .",
    "it is defined by @xmath63 as shown in figure  [ fig : limitset50358 ] , its limit set , when the left and right radii are respectively equal to 3 and 0 , can be viewed as 2-row tiles of one of the following types :            among the 16 different quadruplets of 0s and 1s , the limit set of rule 50358 contains only the following ones : @xmath64 among all the four - input rules having the same images as rule 50358 for all these 11 quadruplets one can verify that only rules 16566 , 49334 , and 50870 are enc and have the same limit set as rule 50358 .",
