    "if the energy associated with the translational temperature of a gas is low compared to the relevant excitation energies and to the energy associated with the inverse observation time , then the gas can be considered as `` frozen '' and is analogous to an amorphous solid , or a glass .",
    "such a frozen gas can be produced by laser cooling , and the atoms or molecules can be selectively placed in certain excited states .",
    "when only a few states are involved , the system is analogous to a spin glass and can support polarization waves ( dipolar frenkel excitons ) that are analogous to spin waves . in this paper , we introduce a basic example of such waves and discuss their excitation .    in laser experiments ,",
    "the frozen gas is set up in a non - equilibrium electronic state , and the evolution of this state is measured after some elapsed time .",
    "relaxation processes can be neglected for the duration of the experiment .",
    "thus , the electronic state evolves towards dynamical equilibrium through the excitation of polarization waves in the random medium of the frozen gas .",
    "the theory of this process must determine the spectrum of the polarization waves as well as their excitation probability during the transient evolution to dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the two aspects of the problem will often be intermingled .",
    "however , we have chosen to work on a system where they can be separated to some extent .",
    "the system under consideration is fully described in an earlier paper by j. s. frasier , v. celli , and t. blum,@xcite henceforth to be referred to as fcb . in the present paper , we develop an improved theory of the particular case that is discussed in sec .",
    "iii of fcb , under the heading `` sparse @xmath0 in a bath of @xmath1 . '' simply put , we consider one atom initially in state @xmath2 that is immersed in a frozen gas of atoms in state @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath2 state is connected to a @xmath4 state by a dipole matrix element @xmath5 , and an @xmath3 state is connected to a @xmath6 state by a dipole matrix element @xmath7 . the @xmath6 and @xmath4 states are singled out from all possible states , because the @xmath0 transition is resonant , i.e. , @xmath8 , and it is known that the transition rate peaks sharply at resonance.@xcite deviations from resonance are not considered in this paper .",
    "the resonance condition is achieved by the application of a static electric field .",
    "the @xmath0 process excites polarization waves described by @xmath9 transitions in the gas of @xmath3 atoms . typically , the number @xmath10 of @xmath3 atoms in the volume @xmath11 is such that @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath2 atoms are `` sparse '' if their number @xmath14 is such that @xmath15 , and in that case the result for @xmath14 atoms can be obtained by computing the result for one @xmath2 atom , averaging over distributions of the @xmath3 atoms , and then multiplying this result by @xmath14 .",

    "[ conc ] . in fcb ,",
    "all the results depend only on an angular average of @xmath29 and , as is shown in the appendix of that paper , one can work with the effective angle - averaged potential @xmath30 . in the treatment presented here , however , the angular dependence plays a more important role .    the potentials of eqs .",

    "that @xmath92 will have a pole at some @xmath93 , a pole at @xmath94 , and a pole at some @xmath95 .",
    "therefore the inverse fourier transform can be computed by summing the residues of these poles and integrating around the cut , a process which is amenable to numerical techniques . however , the result is unreliable because the pole at @xmath94 is not really present in a random medium .",

    "( [ m0best ] ) is very cumbersome . in practice ,",
    "we have found it preferable to solve the equations ( 1 ) numerically for a given configuration of a few hundred atoms , and then average over an ensemble of configurations .",
    "these results will be reported in a separate publication .",
    "in the course of our theoretical investigation of the transient behavior of an optically excited gas , we have come across a particular class of polarization waves .",
    "they are frenkel dipolar excitons , with the difference that the degeneracies of the @xmath3 and @xmath6 states have been lifted by the application of a static magnetic field .",
    "first , we note that the spin - orbit coupling separates the @xmath97 states from the @xmath98 states .",
    "then , considering the @xmath97 states , we see that the interaction between the @xmath99 and @xmath100 states is indeed proportional to @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the angle between the interatomic vector and the applied magnetic field . in the actual experiments,@xcite",
    "there is a spatially varying magnetic field in the magneto - optical trap , and the full analysis is much more complicated .    in the simplest case",
    "these waves are dispersionless and their frequency , given in eqs .",
    "( [ uk ] ) and ( [ omegak ] ) , depends on the angle @xmath103 between the propagation vector and the field s direction according to @xmath104 . these waves have not ( to our knowledge ) been previously recognized , perhaps because their occurrence is confined to systems that can be described by the highly simplified eq .",
    "( 1a ) , which additionally is treated in the continuum approximation .",
    "we remark that the continuum approximation becomes exact in the long wavelength limit and is expected to have a wide range of validity because the dipole - dipole interaction is long - ranged .",
    "the polarization waves also exist on a regular lattice , with a dispersion relation that can be calculated.@xcite in a frozen gas the excitation spectrum will spread out , but localization effects are probably small , again because of the long - range nature of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "although in our model system almost all atoms are in an excited @xmath3 state , they could just as well be in the ground state .",
    "what is important to the model is that this state couples effectively to a single @xmath6 state .",
    "this is a good approximation for the rydberg atoms of the system we are modeling,@xcite but it is not a good approximation in general . also , the size of the dipole matrix element @xmath7 is particularly large for rydberg atoms .    finally , we mention that the @xmath105 dipole - dipole interaction does not include retardation effects .",
    "however , these are expected to influence the results only by inducing some dispersion at very long wavelengths .    in this paper",
    "we consider a particular mechanism of excitation of the polarization waves , namely , we allow the resonant transfer @xmath0 to create the initial @xmath6 state that then interacts with the @xmath3 states.@xcite however , other mechanisms of creation of the @xmath6 state would work just as well as long as a single @xmath6 state is created .",
    "we have also assumed that if only a few @xmath6 atoms are created , then each can be treated independently in accordance with the sparse limit",
    ".    we outline ( but do not carry out in detail in this paper ) the calculation of the transient behavior involving the excitation of the newly - found polarization waves in a frozen gas .",
    "while this allows us to establish contact with existing or currently planned experiments , one should perhaps think instead of more direct ways of observing the polarization waves .",
