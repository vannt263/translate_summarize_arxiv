    "since the ads / cft correspondence was proposed@xcite , an important question has been how it can be read to determine properties of the bulk theory from cft quantities .",
    "there has been an enormous amount of investigation of various aspects of the boundary behavior that are implied by different features of the bulk theory , but there has been comparatively little investigation of the problem of extracting bulk behavior from the boundary theory .",
    "this problem , which might be referred to as `` decoding the hologram , '' has remained challenging .",
    "of course , one of the purported miracles of the correspondence is precisely related to this question , that of how a higher - dimensional theory could be fully encoded in the lower - dimensional one .",
    "one of the challenges is to find sufficiently sharply refined boundary quantities that would be sensitive to fine - grained bulk detail .",
    "we will particularly focus on the question of whether and how the bulk s - matrix could be extracted from the boundary theory .",
    "proposals for a prescription to do so from boundary correlators were outlined in @xcite . however , there are considerable subtleties in implementing such proposals , described for example in @xcite",
    ". in particular , generic boundary data that might be used to specify incoming states , corresponding to non - normalizable behavior of states near the boundary , produces divergences that obscure physics at scales short compared to the ads scale , @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that one consider more specialized boundary sources . in order to localize at scales smaller than @xmath2 in the bulk ,",
    "one expects to need a construction of bulk wavepackets that do so .",
    "however , in order to avoid the divergences from the non - normalizable behavior , one expects that such data should have compact support on the boundary .",
    "the present paper will propose a class of sources and corresponding bulk wavepackets , which appear to strike an optimal balance between these criteria .",
    "specifically , they have compact boundary support and are also taken to have high - frequency modulation in order to maximize localization properties .",
    "we then use these wavepackets to see how bulk s - matrix elements in the plane wave limit can be extracted from a candidate class of boundary correlators , in a certain scaling limit .",
    "this can happen only if the correlators have a certain singularity structure , which , we will explain , is necessary for producing the correct bulk kinematics .",
    "this singularity is only visible in the lorentzian regime and can be reached by a specific analytic continuation of the euclidean correlator , similar to the one considered in @xcite in the context of the regge limit of cft correlators and eikonal scattering in ads .",
    "while the correlators we consider are those arising via the gkpw prescription @xcite from the bulk supergravity , and thus do not arise directly from a boundary cft , this construction provides an important test in principle , elucidating necessary cft structure to encode certain local bulk dynamics .",
    "thus , we suggest it supplies a piece of the answer to the question of how one might `` decode the hologram . ''    in outline , the next section will give our explicit boundary sources and will investigate some bulk properties of the corresponding wavepackets .",
    "next , section three , first from the bulk perspective , explains how such wavepackets could be tuned via an appropriate scaling limit to extract s - matrix elements for plane waves , from a simultaneous @xmath3 and large - wavepacket limit .",
    "then , a corresponding discussion is given on the boundary side , where one finds that the bulk kinematics of the momentum - conserving delta function can be encoded in a certain boundary singularity structure and that , for cfts with this structure , the reduced transition matrix element could be read off from the coefficient of the singularity .",
    "finally , section four shows that certain proposed cft correlators , derived in other works from bulk supergravity , reproduce the correct singularity structure and , via our prescription , the correct reduced transition matrix elements .",
    "two appendices contain technical details .",
    "our starting point will be to specify boundary data that constructs wavepackets , whose scattering we will then study .",
    "our goal is to have these wavepackets sufficiently localized that they scatter only within a region small as compared to the ads radius .",
    "we begin by reviewing some basics of ads geometry .",
    "ads@xmath4 may be thought of as a hyperboloid @xmath5 in @xmath6 .",
    "ads@xmath7 embedded in @xmath8 is shown in figure [ hyperboloid ] .",
    "the point @xmath9 , which we will take as the point about which our wavepackets will intersect , is also shown .     is shown in blue .",
    "the revolution axis of the hyperboloid corresponds to the spacelike direction of @xmath8 and the transverse plane is timelike .",
    "global time is the angular coordinate in this plane .",
    "the point @xmath10 is a reference point in ads@xmath7 .",
    "the null momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 live in the tangent space to ads at @xmath10 .",
    "the boundary sources are supported in the neighborhood of the boundary points @xmath13 . on the right",
    ", we show the universal cover of ads@xmath7 conformally compactified .",
    ", width=415 ]    for present purposes we will work on the cover of ads .",
    "we will parameterize this in terms of global coordinates @xmath14 , with @xmath15 a @xmath16-dimensional unit vector on @xmath17 ; these are related to embedding coordinates by @xmath18 then the metric takes the form [ globalmet ] ds^2=r^2 ^ 2(-d^2 + d^2 + ^2 d^2 )  .",
    "points on the boundary of ads , @xmath19 , naturally map to the corresponding null rays in the embedding space , @xmath20    the flat space limit of the vicinity of the point @xmath21 , which corresponds to @xmath10 , is taken by defining coordinates @xmath22 , @xmath23 . then , the metric ( [ globalmet ] ) becomes @xmath24\\ .\\ ] ] for @xmath25 , this approximates the flat metric . the corresponding neighborhood in the embedding space is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "thus ads@xmath4 is well - approximated by its tangent space @xmath28 , which is simply the subspace of @xmath29 orthogonal to @xmath30 .",
    "we wish to describe boundary sources @xmath31 that construct bulk wavepackets @xmath32 that have appropriate properties , such as localization , _ etc . _",
    "these will be related through the bulk - boundary propagator , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a boundary point , the product in the denominator is formed between the embedding - space quantities corresponding to @xmath35 and @xmath36 , via ( [ globalcoords ] ) and",
    "( [ boundcoords ] ) , @xmath37 is the conformal dimension , and the @xmath38 prescription is that appropriate to the neighborhood of the point @xmath21 .",
    "prescription on the universal cover of ads see @xcite . ] in our conventions , which include powers of @xmath2 to yield appropriate bulk dimensions for bosonic fields , the constant @xmath39 is given by c _",
    "the bulk wavepacket will be given by @xmath40    it is important that the boundary source @xmath31 be a smooth , compactly supported function .",
    "the requirement of compact support will become necessary when considering multiple boundary sources , as there are divergences when sources overlap , as emphasized in @xcite . from the ads side , this can be understood by noting that if there are multiple overlapping non - normalizable modes , integrals over bulk interaction points will not converge .",
    "it is also possible to understand the divergence from the cft perspective , where it arises when two cft operators approach the same point .",
    "the smoothness requirement is useful in ensuring the approximations made later in the paper are well controlled , forcing the fourier transform @xmath41 to fall faster than any power at high frequencies .",
    "we shall localize our source around the boundary point @xmath42 .",
    "we also introduce explicit frequency dependence , in order to produce a bulk wavepacket with frequencies near @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we consider a boundary source of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a @xmath46 function with @xmath47 and with compact support of width @xmath48 about the origin , = _ 0  , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 thus give the widths of the wavepacket on the boundary . in order to achieve the desired localization , we take @xmath51      we next examine the form of the bulk wavepacket corresponding to the source ( [ source ] ) in the vicinity of the point @xmath21 , which we would like to be the interaction region between such wavepackets . in order that the wavepacket pass through this region ,",
    "we take @xmath52 . near @xmath21 , and for small @xmath53 , ( [ boundcoords ] ) and ( [ centralcoords ] ) give -pxr+ t- r - t -  . substituting this into equation ( [ bulkboundary ] ) , we find _ ( , _ 0)(x)c _ r^-(d-1)/2 dd  , and the substitution and @xmath54 gives @xmath55    for large @xmath56 , the dominant contribution to the integral over @xmath57 comes from the singularity at @xmath58 ; subleading contributions are given by the series expansion in @xmath57 of the source near the singularity , and hence are supressed by powers of @xmath59 .",
    "thus , @xmath60 where @xmath61    for @xmath62 , the first @xmath63 , and the integral over angles gives the fourier transform of the angular source .",
    "thus , in the limit of small @xmath50 , we find _",
    "( , _ 0)(x ) _",
    "( , _ 0)(0)e^ikx [ planewave ] where @xmath64 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath65 is easily evaluated , to give _ ( , _ 0)(0)= _ ^-1r^-(d+1)/2 d l ( )  . in the limit of small @xmath50 ,",
    "d l ( ) = ( ) ^d-1 l_d-1  , with _",
    "d-1 = d^d-1l ( ) = _ d-2_0^^d-2 dl ( )   and @xmath66 the volume of unit @xmath67 .    outside of the small @xmath68 limit",
    ", we see that the function @xmath69 is a wavepacket with characteristic widths given by [ bulksize ] t = r , x_= 1 in the longitudinal direction @xmath70 and in the transverse directions , respectively .",
    "if we wish to have a wave packet that looks approximately like a plane wave near @xmath21 , but is well localized at short distances as compared to @xmath2 , we require @xmath71 which , using ( [ bulksize ] ) , is equivalent to ( [ boundcond ] ) .",
    "our goal will be to establish a relation between the cft correlators and elements of the s - matrix of the dual string theory in the flat ( minkowski ) limit .",
    "we will do so via a limiting procedure similar to that proposed in @xcite . specifically",
    ", we will scatter four of the wavepackets we have described , in the vicinity of the point @xmath21 , adjusting them such that their typical widths remain less than the ads radius .",
    "this is then expected to confine the interactions to the ( almost ) flat neighborhood of this point and , under the limit of infinite ads radius , allows one to extract flat space s - matrix elements . in particular , we shall focus on @xmath72 elastic scattering with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "since this construction is based on choosing specific boundary sources integrated against a cft correlation function , this then exhibits the appropriate limit of such correlators to be taken if bulk s - matrix elements are to be extracted . we emphasize that we will ultimately work with correlation functions that are derived from the bulk supergravity ( or string ) feynman rules , as in @xcite . by showing how to isolate the needed behavior from such correlators that have a local bulk origin , we thus provide a test that can be applied to a true boundary conformal field theory , such as @xmath75 super - yang mills , to see whether it has the appropriate structure to correspond to a local bulk theory .",
    "we work in the vicinity of @xmath21 , approximately parameterized by ( [ centralcoords ] )",
    ". we will use wavepackets as given by ( [ source ] ) , with @xmath76-dimensional momenta [ stk ] k_i = ( _ i , _ i )  .",
    "our convention is that all momenta flow _ into _ the corresponding diagram , and in particular , @xmath77 are negative .",
    "it will also be useful to define the corresponding ( inward pointing ) unit vectors , [ sk ] _",
    "i = |_i| _ i  .",
    "we thus take wavepackets ( [ source ] ) with @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , defined in terms of the angles [ thetadef ] _",
    "i = -_i  .",
    "these produce bulk wavefunctions @xmath80 with behavior as described in section [ wavepackint ] .",
    "the scattering amplitude between these wave functions reads @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the amputated bulk green s function .",
    "we shall take the flat space limit and the plane wave limit together , as in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we introduce a dimensionless scaling parameter @xmath83 and define @xmath84 we then take the limit of large @xmath83 , holding the @xmath85 and hatted quantities fixed . the conditions ( [ boundcond ] ) and ( [ bulkcond ] ) are automatically satisfied due to the strong ordering @xmath86 . in this limit ,",
    "the curvature corrections become small because the range of the wave packets scales with @xmath83 and the ads radius of curvature scales with @xmath87 . in the flat region ,",
    "the wavepackets take the form _ k_i(x)e^ik_ix f_i(x )  , where the envelope @xmath88 is given by ( [ bulkpack ] ) , and becomes nearly constant .    in the absence of ir divergences or other subtleties , we thus expect that in ( [ corrfcn ] ) we can replace the ads green function @xmath89 by the corresponding flat - space green function , which we write in the form @xmath90 the scattering amplitude ( [ corrfcn ] ) then becomes @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the fourier transform of @xmath93 . in the limit @xmath94 , the support of @xmath92 gets localized at @xmath95 . in particular , one finds that _ i(k_i - k_i)(2)^d+1^d+1(k_i - k_i ) _",
    "k_i(0 )  . [ flim ]    of course",
    ", @xmath96 is directly related to the flat s - matrix , modulo the usual subtleties of lsz , etc .",
    "in particular , the s - matrix has the form @xmath97 , and for two - particle scattering between plane - wave states , k_3,k_4| t|k_1,k_2= ( 2)^d+1 ^d+1(_i k_i ) t(s , t )  , where one typically defines the mandelstam invariants [ mandelstam ] s= -(k_1+k_2)^2,t= -(k_1+k_3)^2,u=-(k_1+k_4)^2  , and @xmath98 for massless particles .",
    "the scattering angle @xmath99 is given by ^2 = -  ,    ^2 = -  , and @xmath100 is the square of the center - of - mass energy . specifically , there is a direct contribution corresponding to the `` one '' in @xmath101 , which would arise from disconnected diagrams , and connected diagrams produce @xmath102 .",
    "focussing on the latter , we expect @xmath103 , and thus combining ( [ fmeqn ] ) , ( [ flim ] ) , that @xmath104 a_{cft}(b_i)\\ ,        \\label{mainformulaa } \\end{eqnarray } where \\bes n_i = { 1\\over \\eta^{2(\\delta_i - d ) } } { 1\\over \\mathcal{d}_{\\delta_i } \\tilde{l}_{d-1}|\\omega_i|^{\\delta_i -1 } \\rhat^{\\delta_i -(d + 1)/2 } \\deltathetahat^{d-1}}\\ .",
    "\\ees we wish to see how , for a given cft , the expression on the right hand side produces the left hand side .     the form of the cft four - point function is highly constrained by conformal invariance .",
    "let $ p_i = p(b_i)$ be given by ( \\ref{boundcoords } ) ; then \\begin{equation }   \\label{acftdef } a_{cft}(b_i)= \\frac{c_{\\delta_1 } c_{\\delta_2 } } { ( -2 p_1 \\cdot p_3+i\\epsilon)^{\\delta_1 } ( - 2 p_2\\cdot p_4 + i\\epsilon)^{\\delta_2 } }   \\mathcal{a } ( z,\\bar{z})\\ , , \\ ] ] where we chose the normalization so that @xmath105 corresponds to the disconnected contribution and @xmath106 and @xmath107 are defined in terms of the cross ratios @xmath108 and @xmath109 a first check of ( [ mainformula ] ) is that the rhs is zero for generic @xmath110 s not summing to zero . in this case",
    ", we are probing the four point function at generic values of the cross ratios where the function is regular .",
    "therefore , the @xmath111 integrals over the boundary will generate a fourier transform of a smooth compact support function . in the limit @xmath94",
    ", the frequency scales with @xmath87 and the width scales with @xmath112 .",
    "thus the final result is zero as expected .",
    "we expect the needed delta function to arise from singular behavior of @xmath113 .",
    "the wavepackets in ( [ mainformulaa ] ) force the @xmath114 to be in the vicinity of @xmath115 , as seen from equations ( [ stk]-[thetadef ] ) . to exhibit the singular behavior ,",
    "we let @xmath116 for @xmath117 , and @xmath118 for @xmath119 .",
    "let us introduce new parameters @xmath120 , @xmath121 through @xmath122 and @xmath123 ; these can be shown to be given by @xmath124 and [ rhodef ] ^2 =  . we recognize in this last expression the graham determinant of the null vectors @xmath13 . for momentum - conserving @xmath125 s , we then find that @xmath126 yield @xmath127  this follows from linear dependence of the vectors @xmath13 . we conclude that , for momentum - conserving @xmath125 s , the @xmath94 limit in ( [ mainformula ] ) is probing the @xmath128 region of the correlator .    the reduced amplitude @xmath113 is in general a dimensionless function of the cross ratios . we have found that to produce the correct bulk structure , @xmath129 must diverge in the kinematical limit @xmath130 .",
    "we shall focus on describing tree level interactions in @xmath76-dimensional spacetime controlled by the coupling constant @xmath131 .",
    "then , the amplitude @xmath129 will be proportional to the dimensionless factor @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is fixed by dimensional analysis .",
    "this interaction corresponds to a flat space matrix element of the form @xmath134 , where @xmath99 is the scattering angle . in the particular case",
    "where the external scalars are minimally coupled to an exchanged particle , @xmath133 is the spin of the exchanged particle .",
    "thus , we expect an amplitude that behaves as @xmath135 in the vicinity @xmath136 . for now , we assume this generic power law divergence but , below , we shall be able to fix the exponent @xmath137 by requiring appropriate scaling .",
    "moreover , in section [ examples ] we will examine some specific amplitudes ( computed via the bulk supergravity ) and confirm that they exhibit such singularities .",
    "we will also examine the kinematical origin of the singularity at @xmath127 later in this section .",
    "the full delta function on momenta follows from the detailed structure of this singularity .",

    "moreover , the distribution @xmath142 becomes very flat , as compared to the variation in the exponential .",
    "we thus replace it by its value at zero , @xmath47 .",

    "a non - vanishing result comes from the singularity at @xmath143 , which for momentum - conserving @xmath110 produces the singularity at @xmath127 .",
    "the delta function follows by examining perturbations of this singularity as the momenta are varied away from conserved values .",
    "we first examine the contributions of the graham determinant in ( [ rhodef ] ) . with @xmath144",
    ", we find via ( [ boundcoords ] ) p_ip_j = ( 12 _ ij^2 ^ 4 + k_ik_j_i_j ) + o[(/^2)^4 ] with @xmath145 , and with plus sign for @xmath146 or @xmath147 , and minus otherwise .",
    "thus , the determinant yields ( p_ip_j ) = ( k_ik_j_i_j ) + o(^2 )  .",
    "while it should be possible to derive expressions in a general frame , we find it convenient to pick a particular frame to evaluate the quantities entering the correlator .",
    "we do this using the isometry group of ads , @xmath148 .",
    "this contracts to the flat poincare group , so that such transformations can be used to pick particular lorentz frames .    in making",
    "coordinate choices , we also note that @xmath149 is invariant under translations of @xmath150 .",
    "this means that we can take @xmath151 , and eliminate @xmath152 from the correlator .",
    "the integral over @xmath153 then gives @xmath154 .",
    "then , let us choose @xmath155 , as part of going to the center of mass frame .",
    "moreover , in general @xmath156 and @xmath157 define a plane ; let @xmath158 be the projection of @xmath159 perpendicular to that plane . also , define @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",

    "the formula ( [ boundcoords ] ) then gives p((-i e^i ) , ( -i e^i ) , )  . with the kinematics described in section [ flats ] , this then yields the continuations @xmath207     and @xmath208 starting from the euclidean regime at @xmath205 to the lorentzian one at @xmath206 , for the particular scattering angle @xmath209 . , width=264 ]    in general the four point function is a multivalued function with branch points at @xmath210 .",
    "therefore , it is important to evaluate the four point function in the appropriate riemman sheet . the standard choice for the euclidean four point function is to choose the branch cuts along the positive real axis . from figure [ wickrotation ]",
    "we see that under the wick rotation @xmath107 crosses this branch cut .",
    "it is also important that @xmath106 approaches the real axis from below and @xmath107 from above @xmath211      we start by considering a contact interaction with coupling @xmath212 between our two scalar fields produced by a quartic vertex in ads@xmath4 .",
    "the coupling @xmath212 has length dimension @xmath213 and therefore corresponds to @xmath214 in ( [ lima ] ) .",
    "moreover , the tree level witten diagram is simply given by @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the standard d - function reviewed in appendix [ dfunctions ] .",
    "using equation ( [ dtodbar ] ) we find the reduced amplitude @xmath217 where @xmath218 and @xmath219 are defined in terms of @xmath106 and @xmath220 in eq .",
    "( [ uvdef ] ) .",
    "when @xmath221 and @xmath222 are positive integers , we can determine the small @xmath120 behavior of the @xmath223-function using the techniques explained in appendix [ dfunctions ] .",
    "we obtain @xmath224 with = _ 1+_2-  , in agreement with the prediction ( [ beta ] ) , and which gives ( ) = i ( 1-)^_1+_2 - 2  . inserting this expression into ( [ result ] )",
    "we obtain the simple reduced transition matrix element t(s , t)=g^2  , as expected for a contact interaction .",
    "we now consider scalar exchanges in ads@xmath4 , which correspond to @xmath225 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the associated four point function can be reduced to a finite sum of d - functions if @xmath226 minus the conformal dimension of the t - channel exchanged scalar is a positive even integer .",
    "we shall consider this particular case . in appendix [ dfunctions ] , we show that different d - functions have different singular behavior at @xmath127 . in particular , the singularity at @xmath127 gets stronger as the sum of the indices of the d - function increases . therefore , in the sum of d - functions obtained in @xcite it",
    "is enough to keep @xmath227 which gives @xmath228 using again the result @xmath229 we confirm the predicted power of the singularity at @xmath127 and obtain @xmath230 the prescription ( [ result ] ) then gives @xmath231 which agrees with the expected flat space result .",
    "in @xcite the contribution to the four point function of @xmath232 scalar operators from t - channel graviton exchange in ads@xmath233 was determined . in our conventions , the result reads corresponds to the disconnected contribution , the normalization can be read of directly from equation ( c.11 ) of @xcite . ]",

    "the leading singularity as @xmath236 comes from @xmath237 computed in appendix [ dfunctions ] .",
    "this gives @xmath238 which has the predicted form ( [ lima ] ) .",
    "using the value of the constant @xmath239 and our main result ( [ result ] ) , one obtains the matrix element @xmath240 this agrees with the matrix element found in @xcite for t - channel graviton exchange between minimally coupled massless scalars .",
    "since the ads / cft correspondence was first proposed , an important open question has been how to `` decode the hologram , '' that is , read off local bulk physics , particularly on scales short as compared to the ads scale , from the boundary theory . in this paper , we have suggested a partial answer to this question , for certain s - matrix elements . in particular , we have argued that if the boundary cft has a particular singularity structure , ( [ lima ] ) , with a characteristic leading behavior at @xmath177 , then this suffices to produce important kinematical structure , in particular the _ bulk _ momentum conserving delta function .",
    "moreover , where the cft does have such a singularity , the coefficient function of the singularity is expected to provide the reduced transition matrix element , as seen in ( [ result ] ) .",
    "moreover , we have seen this construction in operation , in the examples of section [ examples ] .",
    "there , we explicitly found that for certain `` cft correlators , '' we could indeed reproduce the expected @xmath102-matrix elements .",
    "the reason quotes have been added to this last statement is that the correlators we have considered are , of course , correlators computed from the bulk supergravity , and not derived directly from an actual boundary conformal field theory .",
    "this construction thus explains how such information _ could _ be encoded in and extracted from actual cft correlators .",
    "a very important question for the future is whether correlators computed from actual boundary cfts have the appropriate structure .",
    "thus , the present construction provides an important test for cfts , which can be used to determine whether they encode properties of a bulk local theory . in some respects",
    "this seems a non - trivial test , as it requires a very precise fine - grained structure exhibited in the @xmath139 limit , so in correlators , in the @xmath241 limit , probing very short scales",
    ". it will be interesting to see in what cases such structure is produced in bona - fide conformal field theories .    while we view this as an important test for cfts , it is not a complete one .",
    "for example , the t - matrix of a bulk theory that is at least approximately local on scales long as compared to the string or planck scale is expected to have certain other properties , such as characteristic growth at high energies . moreover",
    ", a complete reconstruction of the s - matrix would require that one can recover other s - matrix elements , for example outside the plane - wave limit@xcite , and for multi - particle processes .",
    "other related investigations include studying processes with external particles with spin , and examining the structure of loop and string amplitudes .",
    "the inclusion of string and loop effects introduces additional parameters in the correlator , namely @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "we then expect that the nature of the @xmath187 singularity of the correlator to change as @xmath244 becomes smaller relative to these parameters .",
    "however , since the singularity has encoded the overall momentum - conserving delta function , one expects aspects of the structure we found in this paper to remain valid for amplitudes at higher - orders , or even non - perturbatively . in short ,",
    "these methods suggest a way that candidate cfts could be probed for anticipated bulk structures .",
    "given a candidate cft , one might investigate the behavior of its correlators for @xmath136 to see whether they have the correct structure to encode various bulk phenomena , such as loop effects , string excitations , and small black holes .",
