    "the physics potential of forward proton tagging at the lhc has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "a main focus of interest is the central exclusive production ( cep ) process , @xmath7 , in which the protons remain intact and the central system @xmath8 is separated from the outgoing protons by a large rapidity gap . to a very good approximation",
    ", @xmath8 is constrained to be in a colour singlet , @xmath9 , state .",
    "observation of any particle , such as a standard model higgs boson , in the central exclusive channel would therefore provide a direct observation of its quantum numbers .",
    "furthermore , by detecting the outgoing protons and measuring their energy loss accurately , it is possible to measure the mass of the centrally produced particle regardless of its decay products @xcite .",
    "because of these unique properties , it has been proposed that forward proton detectors should be installed either side of the interaction points of atlas and/or cms .",
    "the fp420 collaboration has proposed to install detectors in the region 420 m from the interaction points @xcite .",
    "these detectors would allow the detection of central systems in the approximate mass range 70  gev  @xmath10  gev .",
    "proposals also exist to upgrade the capabilities of atlas and cms to detect protons in the 220 m region @xcite .",
    "these detectors , when used in conjunction with 420 m detectors , would extend the accessible mass range well beyond @xmath11 gev .    in this paper , we focus on the central exclusive production of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson and a supersymmetric ( mssm ) higgs boson , with @xmath12 gev . the cep process is shown schematically in figure [ centralexclusive ] .",
    "for this mass region , the dominant decay channel of the higgs boson is to @xmath13 , which is very difficult to observe in conventional higgs searches at the lhc because of the large qcd background .",
    "this is not the case in central exclusive production due to the @xmath9 selection rule , which suppresses the leading order central exclusive @xmath13 background by a factor of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mass of the @xmath13 di - jet system . as we shall see , this renders the @xmath13 decay channel observable at the lhc in certain scenarios if appropriate proton tagging detectors are installed .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "firstly , we give a brief overview of the proposed forward detector upgrades at 220 m and 420 m at atlas and cms , including a simulation of the acceptance of the detectors .",
    "we then discuss the predicted signal cross sections and survey the background processes . taking a 120 gev standard model higgs boson as the benchmark",
    ", we perform a simulated analysis including an estimation of the detector acceptance and smearing effects and level 1 trigger strategies .",
    "the analysis is then extended to the mssm for a particular choice of parameters .    ,",
    "there are two properties of the proposed forward detector systems that are critical to this analysis ; the acceptance of the detectors in the mass range of interest and the ability of the forward detectors to correctly associate the detected outgoing protons with a higgs boson candidate event measured in the central detector .",
    "this matching is critical at high luminosities , where the large number of proton - proton collisions per bunch crossing ( often referred to as pile - up ) leads to a high probability that forward protons from single diffractive or double pomeron ( dpe ) collisions not associated with a higgs candidate event will enter the forward detectors during the same bunch crossing .",
    "the proposed forward detectors aim to associate particular protons with the higgs candidate event by making a measurement of the outgoing proton time - of - flight ( tof ) from the interaction vertex to the detectors .",
    "the difference in the arrival times of the protons on opposite sides of the central detector , @xmath16tof , allows a vertex measurement to be made under the assumption that the detected pair of protons originate from a single hard interaction .",
    "this vertex can then be matched with the vertex of a candidate higgs event reconstructed using the central detector alone .",
    "the current design goal of the forward detectors is to achieve a 10ps accuracy in the tof measurement @xcite , which translates into a vertex measurement accurate to 2.1 mm .",
    "the use of fast - timing measurements is discussed in more detail in section [ olap ] .",
    "it has been suggested that the central detector could also be used provide a third timing measurement @xcite , which could allow for an improved rejection of pile - up events .",
    "we discuss the effect of this possibility in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the acceptance of the forward detectors is governed by the distance of the active edge of the detector from the beam , which determines the smallest measurable energy loss of the outgoing protons , and the aperture of the lhc beam elements between the interaction point and the forward detectors ; protons that lose too much momentum will be absorbed by beam elements , imposing an upper limit on the measurable momentum loss of the protons .",
    "the distance of the active edge of the detector from the beam depends primarily on the beam size at each detector location .",
    "previous estimates @xcite have assumed that the closest distance , @xmath17 , is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the gaussian beam size at the detector location and 0.5 mm is a constant term that accounts for the distance from the sensitive edge of the detector to the bottom edge of the window .",
    "the beam size @xmath20 is approximately 250 @xmath21 m at 420 m and 100 @xmath21 m at 220 m , leading to a distance of closest approach of 3 mm for detectors at 420 m and 1.5 mm for detectors at 220 m .",
    "it is likely that the detectors will begin operation at a larger distance from the beam , at least until the detectors and machine background conditions are well understood @xcite .",
    "figure [ forwardaccept ] ( a ) shows the acceptance for events in which both outgoing protons are detected at 420 m around ip1 ( atlas ) , as a function of the mass of the central system for different detector distances from the beam .",
    "the protons are generated using the exhume monte carlo @xcite and tracked through the lhc beam lattice using the fptrack program with version 6.500 of the lhc optics @xcite .",
    "the central system mass , @xmath15 , is calculated from the forward proton momenta , @xmath22 where the @xmath23 are the fractional momentum losses of the protons and @xmath24 is the centre - of - mass energy of the collision .",
    "the acceptance for a 120 gev higgs boson is independent of the distance of approach of the detectors from the beam up to approximately 7 mm in the case where both protons are detected at 420 m .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "the situation is very different for events in which one proton is tagged at 220 m and the other at 420 m , as shown in figure [ forwardaccept ] ( b ) . in this case , the acceptance is increased when either detector is moved closer to the beam . for a 120 gev higgs boson , with 420 m detectors at 5 mm and 220 m detectors at 2 mm ,",
    "the acceptance is 28% if both protons are tagged at 420 m ( symmetric tag ) with an additional 16% acceptance if one proton is tagged at 220 m and one at 420 m ( asymmetric ) .",
    "moving the 420 m detectors inwards to 3 mm and the 220 m detectors to 1.5 mm increases the asymmetric acceptance by up to a factor of three , as shown in figure [ forwardaccept ] ( b ) .",
    "figures [ forwardaccept ] ( a ) and ( b ) also demonstrate the increasing importance of 220 m detectors as the mass of the central system increases . at ip5 ( cms )",
    "the symmetric acceptance is identical to that at ip1 .",
    "for the asymmetric tags , however , the acceptance is worse by a factor of @xmath25 across the mass range of interest .",
    "this is caused by the horizontal ( rather than vertical ) plane of the crossing angle of the beams at ip5 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the measurement around ip1 ( atlas ) .",
    "central exclusive signal and background events are simulated with parton showering and hadronisation effects using exhume v1.3.4 @xcite .",
    "exhume contains a direct implementation of the khoze , martin and ryskin ( kmr ) calculation of the central exclusive production process @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the cep of a standard model higgs boson decaying to @xmath27 as a function of the higgs mass is shown in figure [ sigmamh ] .",
    "the rapid decrease in cross section at @xmath28 gev occurs because the primary decay channel changes from @xmath13 to @xmath29 . for masses above @xmath30 gev",
    ", it is expected that the higgs boson should be observed in the @xmath29 channel with a luminosity of 30 fb@xmath4 using forward proton tagging @xcite .",
    "the primary uncertainties in the predicted cross section come from two sources ; the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) and the soft survival ( often termed rapidity gap survival ) factor .",
    "the cep cross sections are relatively sensitive to the pdfs because the derivative of the gluon density enters to the fourth power .",
    "figure [ sigmamh ] shows the cross section prediction for three different pdf choices , cteq6 m , mrst2002nlo and cteq6l . the cross section for the cep of a standard model higgs boson of mass @xmath31 gev decaying into b - quarks varies from 1.86  fb ( mrst2002nlo ) to 7.38  fb(cteq6l1 ) .",
    "the spread of a factor of @xmath32 is consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of this analysis , we chose cteq6 m as our default pdf as it lies between the two extremes .",
    "there is some justification for choosing an nlo pdf because the kmr calculation contains a nlo qcd k - factor ( 1.5 ) for sm higgs boson production .",
    "the soft survival factor , @xmath33 , is the probability that there are no additional hard scatters in a single @xmath34 collision and is expected to vary from process to process . for cep processes , we take the exhume default of @xmath35 at lhc energies . until very recently",
    ", there was a consensus that @xmath33 should be between @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the cep of a higgs boson at the lhc @xcite .",
    "two very recent studies have predicted a lower value @xcite and it remains to be seen whether a new theoretical consensus can be reached . in any case",
    ", @xmath33 will be measurable in early lhc data .",
    ", for three different proton parton distribution functions.[sigmamh],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the mssm contains three neutral higgs bosons - two scalar and one pseudo - scalar .",
    "the @xmath38 , parity - even selection rules strongly suppress cep of the pseudo - scalar .",
    "this can be advantageous in areas of mssm parameter space where the pseudo - scalar is almost degenerate in mass to one ( or both ) of the scalar higgs bosons , since cep would provide a clean and complimentary measurement of the mass of the scalar only @xcite , and allow nearly - degenerate higgs bosons to be distinguished @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at large values of tan@xmath39 , the cross section for the cep of the scalar higgs bosons can be strongly enhanced relative to the cep of a sm higgs boson of the same mass @xcite .",
    "we choose a point in parameter space defined by the @xmath40 scenario @xcite with @xmath41 gev and tan@xmath42 , resulting in the scalar higgs boson having a mass of 119.5 gev and a decay width of 3.3 gev . with this choice of parameters",
    ", the lightest scalar higgs boson has an enhanced cep cross section and is almost degenerate in mass with the pseudo - scalar .",
    "the cep cross section for the lightest higgs boson decaying to b - quarks in this scenario is predicted to be @xmath43 fb . the uncertainty on this prediction",
    "is the same as that for the sm higgs boson .",
    "the backgrounds to central exclusive higgs production can be broken down into three categories ; central exclusive di - jet production , double pomeron exchange and overlap .",
    "the most difficult backgrounds to deal with are the central exclusive ( cep ) di - jet backgrounds .",
    "central exclusive @xmath13 production is suppressed at leading order by the @xmath45 selection rule , but is still present and forms an irreducible continuum background beneath the higgs mass peak .",
    "central exclusive glue - glue production has a much larger cross section than @xmath13 production since it is not suppressed .",
    "it contributes to the background when the gluon jets are mis - identified as b - jets ( 1.3% probability for each mis - tag at atlas - see section [ detector ] ) .",
    "central exclusive @xmath46 events do not contribute to the background for two reasons .",
    "firstly , @xmath46 production is suppressed with respect to the @xmath13 process by @xmath47 .",
    "secondly , the @xmath46 background is further suppressed by a factor of @xmath48 relative to the @xmath13 cross section assuming that the probability of mis - identifying a c - quark is approximately 0.1 for a b - tag efficiency of 0.6 @xcite .",
    "higher order cep di - jet backgrounds such as the 3-jet final state @xmath49 process have been studied in @xcite .",
    "it is expected that these backgrounds will be lower than the lo @xmath50 and @xmath27 backgrounds after experimental cuts , but they should be implemented into the exhume monte carlo and a full study performed before definitive conclusions can be drawn .",
    "double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) is defined as the process @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a central system produced by pomeron - pomeron fusion ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the pomeron is assigned a partonic structure and so there are always pomeron remnants accompanying the hard scatter as shown in figure [ dpepomeron ] .",
    "the relevant background processes are separated into @xmath13 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 represents light - quark and gluons jets .",
    "the dpe events are simulated using the pomwig v2.0 event generator @xcite , which implements the diffractive parton distribution functions measured by the h1 collaboration @xcite .",
    "we use h1 2006 fit b , although we discuss the effect of using different diffractive pdfs .",
    "we choose the pomwig option to treat the valence partons in the pomeron as gluons .",
    "pomwig is normalised to the h1 data , and therefore does not account for the soft survival factor . for hard double pomeron events , we take @xmath35 .",
    "pomwig is also capable of generating scatters involving sub - leading ( non - diffractive ) exchanges ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "we do not include this contribution because the cross section for @xmath57 @xmath13 events is @xmath58 0.034 fb for @xmath59 , @xmath60 gev and @xmath61-quark @xmath62 gev .",
