    "although a generic vacuum of the theory is anti - de sitter one , particular limits of the theory allow for the minkowski vacuum . in this limit",
    "post - newtonian coefficients coincide with those of the pure gr .",
    "thus , the deviations from the conventional gr can be tested only beyond the post - newtonian corrections , that is for a system with strong gravity at astrophysical scales .    in this context",
    ", ir - modified hoava gravity seems to be consistent with the current observational data , but in order to test its viability more observational constraints are necessary . in ref .",
    "@xcite , potentially observable properties of black holes in the hoava - lifshitz gravity with minkowski vacuum were considered , namely , the gravitational lensing and quasinormal modes .",
    "it was shown that the bending angle is seemingly smaller in the considered hoava - lifshitz gravity than in gr , and the quasinormal modes of black holes are longer lived , and have larger real oscillation frequency in the hoava - lifshitz gravity than in gr . in ref .",
    "@xcite , by adopting the strong field limit approach , the properties of strong field gravitational lensing in the deformed hrava - lifshitz black hole were considered , and the angular position and magnification of the relativistic images were obtained .",
    "compared with the reissner - norstrm black hole , a significant difference in the parameters was found .",
    "thus , it was argued this may offer a way to distinguish a deformed hrava - lifshitz black hole from a reissner - norstrm black hole . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the behavior of the effective potential was analyzed , and the timelike geodesic motion in the hoava - lifshitz spacetime was also explored . in this paper , we further explore the possibility of testing the viability of hoava - lifshitz gravity using thin accretion disk properties .",
    "recent observations suggest that around almost all of the active galactic nuclei ( agn s ) , or black hole candidates , there exist gas clouds surrounding the central compact object , together with an associated accretion disc , on a variety of scales from a tenth of a parsec to a few hundred parsecs @xcite .",
    "these gas clouds are assumed to form a geometrically and optically thick torus ( or warped disc ) , which absorbs most of the ultraviolet radiation and the soft x - rays .",
    "the gas exists in either the molecular or the atomic phase .",
    "the most powerful evidence for the existence of super massive black holes comes from the vlbi imaging of molecular @xmath0 masers in the active galaxy ngc 4258 @xcite .",
    "this imaging , produced by doppler shift measurements assuming keplerian motion of the masering source , has allowed a quite accurate estimation of the central mass , which has been found to be a @xmath1 super massive dark object , within @xmath2 parsecs .",
    "hence , important astrophysical information can be obtained from the observation of the motion of the gas streams in the gravitational field of compact objects .",
    "the mass accretion around rotating black holes was studied in general relativity for the first time in @xcite . by using an equatorial approximation to the stationary and axisymmetric space - time of rotating black holes ,",
    "steady - state thin disk models were constructed , extending the theory of non - relativistic accretion @xcite . in these models hydrodynamical equilibrium is maintained by efficient cooling mechanisms via radiation transport , and the accreting matter has a keplerian rotation .",
    "the radiation emitted by the disk surface was also studied under the assumption that black body radiation would emerge from the disk in thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "the radiation properties of the thin accretion disks were further analyzed in @xcite and in @xcite , where the effects of the photon capture by the hole on the spin evolution were presented as well . in these works the efficiency",
    "with which black holes convert rest mass into outgoing radiation in the accretion process was also computed .",
    "more recently , the emissivity properties of the accretion disks were investigated for exotic central objects , such as wormholes @xcite , and non - rotating or rotating quark , boson or fermion stars , brane - world black holes or gravastars @xcite .",
    "the radiation power per unit area , the temperature of the disk and the spectrum of the emitted radiation were given , and compared with the case of a schwarzschild black hole of an equal mass .",
    "the physical properties of matter forming a thin accretion disk in the static and spherically symmetric spacetime metric of vacuum @xmath3 modified gravity models were also analyzed @xcite .",
    "particular signatures can appear in the electromagnetic spectrum , thus leading to the possibility of directly testing modified gravity models by using astrophysical observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to study the thin accretion disk models applied for black holes in hoava - lifshitz gravity models , and carry out an analysis of the properties of the radiation emerging from the surface of the disk . as compared to the standard general relativistic case , significant differences appear in the energy flux and electromagnetic spectrum for hoava black holes , thus leading to the possibility of directly testing the hoava - lifshitz theory by using astrophysical observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks .",

    "the accreting matter in the steady - state thin disk model is supposed to be in thermodynamical equilibrium .",

    "<S> recently , a renormalizable gravity theory with higher spatial derivatives in four dimensions was proposed by hoava . </S>",
    "<S> the theory reduces to einstein gravity with a non - vanishing cosmological constant in ir , but it has improved uv behaviors . the spherically symmetric black hole solutions for an arbitrary cosmological constant , which represent the generalization of the standard schwarzschild-(a)ds solution , has also been obtained for the hoava - lifshitz theory . </S>",
    "<S> the exact asymptotically flat schwarzschild type solution of the gravitational field equations in hoava gravity contains a quadratic increasing term , as well as the square root of a fourth order polynomial in the radial coordinate , and it depends on one arbitrary integration constant . </S>",
    "<S> the ir modified hoava gravity seems to be consistent with the current observational data , but in order to test its viability more observational constraints are necessary . in the present paper we consider the possibility of observationally testing hoava gravity by using the accretion disk properties around black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the energy flux , temperature distribution , the emission spectrum as well as the energy conversion efficiency are obtained , and compared to the standard general relativistic case . </S>",
    "<S> particular signatures can appear in the electromagnetic spectrum , thus leading to the possibility of directly testing hoava gravity models by using astrophysical observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks . </S>"
