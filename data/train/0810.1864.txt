    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) instabilities play a major role in a great variety of astrophysical and space applications .",
    "their importance is epitomized by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) that has been discovered by @xcite and @xcite for infinite cylinders and rediscovered by @xcite in astrophysical context .",
    "it is widely believed to be one of the prime candidates to provide a viable clue to solving the age old puzzle of the outwards transfer of angular momentum in a plethora of astrophysical disk configurations .    however , for a case of finite size system , the common practice in stability analysis to expand the state vector of the linearized dynamical system ( the mhd system of equations in our case ) in plane waves as : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the spatial coordinate ( for simplicity only one spatial coordinate will be considered )",
    ", @xmath2 is the wave number , and @xmath3 is the natural frequency of the system , is not applicable especially for inhomogeneous systems . instead , for such cases the appropriate boundary value problem ( bvp ) for a given set of initial conditions ( ic )",
    "should be solved ( see for example the well - known work of @xcite ) .",
    "the solution of such problems is facilitated by obtaining the natural frequencies of the bounded system @xmath4 for which the state vector of the linearized dynamical system may be written as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are the eigenfunctions of the bvp subjected to specific boundary conditions ( bc ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the main purpose of the current work is to employ such approach in order to investigate the dynamical evolution of localized initial perturbations in rotating magnetized disks of finite thickness .    in reality ,",
    "small perturbations , especially in a system of finite dimensions , do not have the form of a single monochromatic wave , but are rather a superposition of individual waves , i.e. , wave packets .",
    "furthermore , the asymptotic behavior at large times of the wave packet may significantly differ from that of any one of its individual components .",
    "thus , under certain circumstance , even though some of the components of the wave packet may individually grow with time without bound , the wave packet as a whole can remain bounded at a given place and even decay to zero as the packet is convected away . in such cases",
    "the initial perturbations give rise to what is defined as convective instabilities .",
    "in other cases , the exponentially growing components of the wave packets may indeed cause the perturbation to grow without bound at each place . in such cases ,",
    "the perturbations are defined as absolute instabilities .",
    "furthermore , the bc could significantly change the results of the stability analysis ( global stability ) .",
    "it is therefore of utmost importance to investigate the asymptotic ( in time ) development of the solutions of the appropriate cauchy problems in order to determine whether the system is stable or not .",
    "various sets of rules in order to distinguish between convective and absolute instabilities have been given by @xcite , while @xcite have reviewed more recent developments of the theory pertaining to hydrodynamic stability .",
    "the importance of studying the influence of a finite system size on stability analysis has been demonstrated by @xcite who reported that the size of system could play a stabilizing role for the two stream instability .",
    "one should note also that such understanding may play an important role in recent attempts to observe the mri in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "the effect of the finite size of the system is investigated by re - examining the mri for the case of rotating disks with finite thickness .",
    "the basic mhd equations that describe the dynamical development of the system are : @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is acceleration due to gravity , and @xmath10 is speed of light and the rest of the variables have their usual meanings .",
    "the expression for electric field @xmath11 in ideal plasmas is given by : @xmath12 in order to simplify the calculations ( and with no loss of generality of the results ) we assume that the brunt - visl frequency is small in comparison to all other characteristic frequencies in the system and can hence be neglected . thus , the linearized mhd system of equations that describe radially independent perturbations in a keplerian disk under the influence of a constant axial magnetic field , may be represented in the following way :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15,\\;\\;\\ ;   q=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cccc}0 & -2 & 0 & 0   \\\\\\frac{1}{2 } & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{3}{2 } & 0 \\end{array } \\right   ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the steady state density profile , and @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the perturbed radial and azimuthal velocities ( @xmath19 , and the radial and azimuthal components of the magnetic field ( @xmath20 , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ linearmhd ] ) the density is normalized to its value at the disk midplane @xmath21 , the velocities are normalized to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the sound velocity ) , the time is normalized to the inverse steady state angular velocity @xmath24 , the magnetic field is scaled with the steady state axial magnetic field @xmath25 .",
    "finally , lengths are scaled by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the alfvn velocity and @xmath28 is the familiar plasma parameter given by @xmath29 .    as a specific example consider a thin isothermal keplerian disk . in order to model the finite thickness of the disk the following profile @xmath30",
    "is assumed for the density . due to the independence of the perturbations on the radial direction @xmath31",
    "is from now on merely a parameter .",
    "this is tantamount to the local approximation in @xmath31 with @xmath32 , which according to @xcite is the most unstable case . for that case , assuming that the ic are @xmath33 , and employing the laplace transform , the set of eqs.([linearmhd ] ) is reduced to the following single inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation ( ode ) : @xmath34=2i\\omega\\beta^2 v'_r(z,0 ) \\label{bphieinh}\\ ] ] where    @xmath34=\\frac{d}{dz}\\left[e^{z^2}\\frac{d^2}{dz^2}\\left(e^{z^2}\\frac{d\\widetilde{b}_{\\varphi}}{dz}\\right)\\right]+ ( 3\\beta+2\\lambda^2)\\frac{d}{dz}\\left(e^{z^2}\\frac{d\\widetilde{b}_{\\varphi}}{dz}\\right ) + \\lambda^2(\\lambda^2-\\beta)\\widetilde{b}_{\\varphi } , % \\label{bphieinh}\\ ] ]    @xmath35 represents the re - normalized spectral parameter @xmath3 , and @xmath36 is the laplace transform of the azimuthal component of the perturbed magnetic field .",
    "the solution of eq.([bphieinh ] ) should satisfy the following bc :    @xmath37    boundary conditions ( [ mhdbcinh ] ) are obtained due to the requirement that at @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the energy flux of the perturbation is finite .",
    "the solutions of the bvp ( [ bphieinh])-([mhdbcinh ] ) can be constructed by the countable set of the solutions of the homogeneous equation @xmath41=0 $ ] , subject to homogeneous boundary conditions .",
    "the solutions of that problem are termed eigenfunctions of the homogeneous equation . assuming completeness and orthogonal property of the eigenfunctions allow to express the solution of eq.([bphieinh ] ) in a simple way for an arbitrary ic by using green s function ( see appendixes a and b for proof of orthogonality , and construction of the green s function ) .",
    "the latter is represented by an appropriate set of eigenfunction @xmath42 .",
    "thus , carrying out the inverse laplace transform , the solution of eq.([linearmhd ] ) for @xmath43 is given by the following expression :    @xmath44    where @xmath42 are the eigenfunctions of the homogeneous equation , @xmath45 are the coefficients of the expansion of @xmath46 in the complete set @xmath42 , and @xmath47 are the natural frequencies that correspond to the eigenfunctions @xmath42 .",
    "we turn now to obtaining asymptotic solutions for @xmath42 in the limit @xmath48 [ see @xcite as an example of employing the wkb approximation for some problems in inhomogeneous plasmas ] . in that case",
    "the eigenfunctions may be represented by the following version of the wkb approximation :    @xmath49    inserting expression ( [ asympt ] ) into the homogenous part of eq.([bphieinh ] ) yields :    @xmath50\\right\\}+4s's'''+s^{iv}=0 \\label{eikonal}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath51,\\quad q(z,\\lambda)= -z\\left[e^{-z^2}(2 + 3\\beta/\\lambda^2)+4/\\lambda^2\\right]\\ ] ] and @xmath52 by keeping the leading terms in @xmath53 , eq.([eikonal ] ) can be written as    @xmath54=0 \\label{eikonal0}\\ ] ]    the solutions of eq.([eikonal0 ] ) provide valid approximations for the eigenfunctions of @xmath55 throughout the disk except in the vicinity of the turning points .",
    "assuming that the latter occur at @xmath56 , it can be shown that the last term in eq.([eikonal0 ] ) becomes exponentially small in comparison with other terms ( this assumption will be validated later on ) .",
    "in that case the equation that determines the turning points is given by @xmath57 asymptotic solution of eq.([discr ] ) for large @xmath53 yields the following expression for the turning points : @xmath58 as well as the following form of the discriminant in the vicinity of the turning points : @xmath59 in the outer regions namely @xmath60 and @xmath61 all four functions @xmath62 are real , whereas in the inner region @xmath63 the solutions for @xmath62 acquire non zero imaginary part .",
    "thus , the turning points separate the inner range @xmath63 where the eigenfunctions are oscillatory from the outer regions @xmath60 and @xmath61 where the eigenfunctions decrease exponentially away from @xmath64 and have no zeros at a finite distance @xmath1 .",
    "the behavior of the various solutions of eq.([eikonal0 ] ) as well as the turning points may be seen in fig.1 .",
    "it is obvious from assumption ( [ asympt ] ) and bc ( [ mhdbcinh ] ) that only solution 1 is admissible .",
    "the turning points are obtained as the merging of solution 1 and 2 . in the region between the turning points",
    "two solutions are admissible , that are complex conjugates of each other .",
    "again , due to bc ( [ mhdbcinh ] ) those solutions are marked by a that depicts their common real part .    in the vicinity of the turning",
    "points the solutions assumed in eq.([asympt ] ) are invalid and instead an appropriately re - scaled eq.([bphieinh ] ) is solved .",
    "that solution is then matched asymptotically to the outer solution given by ( [ asympt ] ) and ( [ eikonal0 ] ) where @xmath65 is obtained from branch 1 in fig.1 .    in order to obtain an asymptotic expression for @xmath65 in branch 1 it is noticed again that @xmath66 is asymptotically much smaller than the rest of the terms that multiply @xmath53 in eq.([eikonal0 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "one of the roots is asymptotically zero ( branch 3 ) while the rest three roots are obtained from the cardano solution of the reduced eq.([eikonal0 ] ) .",
    "thus , the root that is represented by branch 1 ( the only admissible root ) gives rise to the following solution in the outer region close to the turning point : @xmath67{|k|}}\\frac{1}{(z - z_0)^{\\frac{1}{4}}}\\exp{[-\\int_{z_0}^z\\sqrt{k(z_0-\\xi)}d\\xi ] } \\label{right}\\ ] ] in the inner region the solution near the turning points is given by @xmath68{|k|}(z_0-z)^{\\frac{1}{4}}}\\left\\{c_1\\exp{[i\\int_{z_0}^z\\sqrt{k(\\xi - z_0)}d\\xi]}+ c_2\\exp{[-i\\int_{z_0}^z\\sqrt{k(\\xi - z_0)}d\\xi]}\\right\\}. \\label{left}\\ ] ] the coefficients ( @xmath69 ) are determined by the connection formulas that express the asymptotic matching of the solution found to the left ( [ left ] ) and to the right ( [ right ] ) of a turning point @xmath64 .",
    "following @xcite the connecting relations are : @xmath70 applying the same rule to the region close to the left turning point located at @xmath71 and requireing that the two expressions are the same throughout the region @xmath72 ( the sum of their phase must be multiple of @xmath73 ) results in the following expression for the eigenfunction : @xmath74 e^{-\\frac{z^2}{4 } } , \\label{wkbsol}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 .",
    "the analytical expression ( [ wkbsol ] ) for the solution in the inner region has been obtained by noticing that away from the turning points @xmath76 is smaller than the rest of the terms in eq.([eikonal0 ] ) and hence to leading order the latter is a biquadratic equation .",
    "the discrete set of eigenvalues @xmath3 is now determined from the bohr - sommerfeld relation that is given by : @xmath77 the integer @xmath78 in the last expression describes the number of zeros of the solution within the inner region [ see eq.([wkbsol ] ) ] , whereas @xmath79 are the natural frequencies of the system that correspond to such eigenfunctions . strictly speaking expression ( [ bz ] )",
    "is valid for @xmath80 .",
    "nevertheless , as is often the case for wkb - type solutions , numerical calculations indicate that expression ( [ wkbsol ] ) provides a close approximation also for @xmath78 s as low as 1 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "it is also evident from fig.2 that the wave length of the perturbation depends on @xmath1 and approaches the disk thickness close to the turning points .",
    "( a ) ( b )    as @xmath81 is the first excited unstable mode , it is easy to show that the disk is stable for @xmath82 where @xmath83 ^ 2)$ ] ( @xmath84 ^ 2)$ ] ) .      to further follow the development of a localized initial perturbation governed by eq .",
    "( [ linearmhd ] ) , consider for example an ic given as : @xmath85 and zero for the rest of the initial values of the perturbed physical variables .",
    "it is easy to see that the perturbation is localized within the disk , if @xmath86 . the dynamical development of the localized initial perturbation that is described by eq.([disksol ] ) depends on the disk `` thickness '' defined by the plasma parameter @xmath28 ( notice that now velocities are scaled by the alfvn velocity which means that the disk thickness is @xmath87 ) . if the disk is thin enough such that @xmath88 all the natural frequencies @xmath47 that are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ bphieinh ] ) are real and hence the disk is stable . in that case following ( [ disksol ] ) the profile of the perturbed azimuthal magnetic field represented by two identical wave packets that move in opposite directions namely up and down . upon reaching the upper and lower turning points ( located at @xmath89 ) the two packets are reflected and continue their motion through the disk .",
    "the amplitudes of the identical wave packets change in time like @xmath90 .",
    "it should be noted however that this picture is valid if the initial perturbation is localized enough .",
    "as example for such behavior , @xmath91 , which has been obtained by using eq.([disksol ] ) @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in this particular case",
    "all eigenfunctions have real natural frequencies [ @xmath94 and there are no growing modes at all ( the wave packets indeed do not grow in time , just move back and forth inside the disk with local alfvn velocity ) .",
    "for `` thick '' disk ( @xmath95 ) some of the natural frequencies have an imaginary part . as the thickness of the disk increases so does the number of unstable modes .",
    "thus for long time @xmath96 where @xmath78 corresponds to natural frequency with a biggest imaginary part . however , for sufficiently localized initial perturbation the fastest growing mode has sufficiently small initial amplitude .",
    "the perturbation then keeps it s original shape for a long time until a growing mode emerges out of the wide initial spectrum and is of order of the amplitude of initial wave packet . raising the value of @xmath28 to @xmath97 ,",
    "one unstable mode , with growth rate @xmath98 enters the spectrum of the eigenmodes . employing again eq.([disksol ] ) together with eigenfunctions @xmath42 results in fig.4 .",
    "it is indeed seen that after long time the unstable mode dominates the perturbation .",
    "thus , the latter eventhough starting as a well confined perturbation develops into a global instability .",
    "it should be noted however , that the time it takes the unstable mode to emerge from the wide spectrum that makes up the localized initial perturbation is about 4 times longer than the predicted growth time ( inverse growth rate ) .",
    "indeed , as the initial perturbation is more localized so the growth time of the most unstable mode is increased relative to its linear predicted value .",
    "it is finally instructive to plot the wave number @xmath99 of the most unstable mode as a function of @xmath28 ( fig.5 ) .",
    "asymptotic estimation reveals that @xmath99 is proportional to @xmath100 .",
    "this implies that the wavelength of the most unstable mode is of the order of @xmath101 ( where @xmath102 is the thickness of the disk ) which to leading order does not depend on @xmath28 .",
    "it is instructive to examine the limit of thick disk such that effect of boundaries may be ignored .",
    "such an assumption is justified when the alfvn traverse time is longer than the time of interest ( say inverse growth rate ) .",
    "renormalizing therefore lengths to @xmath103 solution is sought for @xmath104 , where @xmath87 is now the disk s thickness .",
    "it is readily seen that for such case @xmath105 for odd initial perturbations [ see eq.([wkbsol ] ) where @xmath2 is defined as @xmath106 so that the eigenfunctions can be approximated by plane waves . thus , due to",
    "@xmath107 , the sum ( [ disksol ] ) is replaced by an integral over @xmath2 and eq.([disksol ] ) can be written as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the contour of integration in the complex @xmath3 plane that is a straight line parallel to the real axis and passing above all singular points of the integrand , @xmath110 is the fourier transform of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bphieinh ] ) and the denominator of the integrand is given by @xmath111 it is important to notice now that since the initial perturbation is well localized in space @xmath110 in contrast is close to a constant that is proportional to the localization length . as a result",
    "it can be shown now that @xmath91 obtained by using ( [ aa ] ) is not zero only if the integrand has a singularities of order two ( branch points ) ( see in details in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , examining the equation @xmath112 [ the classical mri dispersion equation @xcite ] it is clear that there is just one branch point that gives rise to instability , which is @xmath113 .",
    "consequently , the long time behavior of the perturbation is given by @xmath114 as remarked above this result is due to the fact that the initial perturbation is localized in space .",
    "if , however , ( a not too physical ) monochromatic perturbation is considered , @xmath110 is a delta function and the familiar purely exponential growth is recovered .",
    "the importance of solving the initial value problem with some appropriate boundary conditions is highlighted . in the classical works of @xcite , and @xcite ,",
    "an infinite cylinder has been considered and the effects of the boundary conditions were neglected . therefore , in those works , naturally , the thickness of the disk does not play any role and consequently can not influence the extent of the domains of instability . in spite of that , physical intuition and insight have led @xcite to conclude that @xmath115 is the lower limit for the disk thickness for the occurrence of the classical mri in disks as for smaller values of @xmath28 the thickness of the disk is smaller than the wave length of the dominant unstable mode . in the current work the stabilizing effects of the boundaries are taken explicitly into account and hence the threshold thickness of the disk may be calculated easily from the wkb solutions obtained in sec.2 .",
    "furthermore , the number of unstable modes as a function of @xmath116 may be estimated with the aid of that solution .",
    "thus , for example , it may be shown that there are only three unstable modes within the disk as long as the its beta value is less than @xmath117 .",
    "such information is significant for the study of the consequent nonlinear development of the instability .",
    "in addition , the shape of the unstable ( as well as the stable ) perturbations has been obtained explicitly and as may be seen by its expression ( [ wkbsol ] ) may differ significantly from the plain waves assumed in the classical works on mri s .",
    "it is finally interesting to note , that going to the limit of thick disks ( see section 2.4 ) and assuming a localized perturbation results in a reduced rate of growth in comparison to the less realistic monochromatic classical result [ see eq.([longtime ] ) ] .",
    "recently , @xcite , and @xcite have considered the effects of the axial localization of the perturbations by studying axisymmetric ballooning modes in finite disks .",
    "such modes are characterized by finite values of the radial wave vector @xmath118 .",
    "the appropriate turning points within the disk were found and consequently a discrete spectrum of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues was obtained .",
    "the growth rates were found to be smaller than their `` long - cylinder '' counterparts .",
    "in particular , it is shown there that the @xmath119 limit can not be obtained from their scalings and asymptotics , as no turning points exist within the disk in that limit . in that sense",
    "the present work is complementary to @xcite as it analyzes that very limit @xmath119 .",
    "indeed , under the current scaling and asymptotic expansion turning points are found within the disk and the corresponding discrete spectrum is obtained .",
    "the linear mhd equations have been employed in order to study the stability and time behavior of a rotating stratified keplerian disks whose density decreases with height .",
    "the full solution of the dynamical evolution in time of an localized gaussian wave packet is explicitly derived and it s long time behavior is discussed .",
    "it is proven analytically ( wkb ) that mri can be suppressed in sufficiently thin disk @xmath120 ( @xcite observed from numerical simulations that if @xmath115 the disk becomes mri stable ) .",
    "numerical solutions of the cauchy problem however , indicates that @xmath121 is of order 1 .",
    "this result is consistent with values obtained by @xcite .",
    "for thicker disks , the number of discrete unstable mode increases with the thickness of the disk .",
    "however , due to the localization in real space the initial amplitude of the unstable mode is diminishingly small and the time it outgrows the original wave packet is significantly longer than its predicted inverse growth rate .",
    "thus , it has been demonstrated numerically the growth time of a perturbation that is initially localized within the inner 5% of the disk , may be an order of magnitude longer than the inverse growth rate of the fastest growing unstable mode .",
    "the considering of the boundary effects may have a large impact on the design of laboratory experiments to model mri , where a magnetic field have to be quite strong and devices can not be very high .",
