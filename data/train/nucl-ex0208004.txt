    "due to the short live time of the flavour - neutral mesons ( eg .",
    "@xmath3 ) , the study of their interaction with nucleons or other mesons is at present not feasible in direct scattering experiments .",
    "one of the methods permitting such investigations is the production of a meson in the nucleon ",
    "nucleon interaction close to the kinematical threshold or in kinematics regions where the outgoing particles possess small relative velocities .",
    "when the relative kinetic energy is in the order of a few mev , the final state particles remain much longer in the range of the strong interaction than the typical life ",
    "time of @xmath4 or @xmath5 baryon resonances with @xmath6 .",
    "thus , they can easily experience a mutual interaction before escaping the area of an influence of the hadronic force .",
    "this interaction modifies the phase - space abundance and changes the distributions of the differential cross sections and the magnitude of the total reaction rate . a precise determination of the energy dependence of the total cross section close to the production threshold of the @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath7 reactions  @xcite revealed an enhancement at low excess energies generally accepted as a signal from the @xmath2nucleon interaction .",
    "a similar effect is also observed in the photoproduction of @xmath2 via the @xmath8 reaction  @xcite , indicating to some extent that the phenomenon is independent of the production process but is rather related to the interaction among @xmath2-meson and nucleons in the @xmath9 region .",
    "interestingly , out of all studied flavour - neutral mesons only the @xmath2-nucleon force is strong enough to manifest itself in the excitation function of the total cross section over the overwhelming nucleon - nucleon interaction . in the case of the production of other mesons",
    "no such enhancement has been observed , though the similar experimental precision has been achieved for example for the threshold production of @xmath10  @xcite or @xmath11  @xcite mesons .",
    "hence , with the up  to  date experimental accuracy , from all @xmath12systems the @xmath13 one reveals by far the most interesting features .",
    "the interaction between particles depends on their relative momenta or equivalently on the invariant masses of the two - particle subsystems .",
    "only two of the invariant masses of the three subsystems are independent .",
    "therefore the entire principally accessible information about the final state interaction of the three  particle system can be presented in the form of the dalitz plot .",
    "figure  [ dalitz_mc](left ) indicates the event distribution over the available surface in the phase - space expected for the @xmath14 system at an excess energy of @xmath15 , assuming a homogeneous primary production and taking into account the s  wave interaction between the protons .",
    "the proton  proton fsi modifies the homogeneous dalitz plot distribution of `` non  interacting particles '' , enhancing its population at a region where the protons have small relative momenta .",
    "figure  [ dalitz_mc](right ) shows the phase - space density distribution simulated when switching off the proton ",
    "proton interaction but accounting for the interaction between the @xmath2meson and the proton . due to the lower strength of this interaction",
    "the expected deviations from a uniform distribution is by about two orders of magnitude smaller , but still one recognizes a slight enhancement of the density in the range of low invariant masses of proton@xmath2 subsystems .",
    "however , due to weak variations of the proton@xmath2 scattering amplitude the enhancement originating from the @xmath2meson interaction with one proton is not separated from the @xmath2meson interaction with the second proton . therefore an overlapping of broad structures occurs .",
    "it is observed that the occupation density grows slowly with increasing @xmath16 opposite to the effects caused by the s  wave proton ",
    "proton interaction , yet similar to the modifications expected for the p  wave one  @xcite . from the above example it is obvious that only in experiments with a high statistics , signals from the meson ",
    "nucleon interaction can appear over the overwhelming nucleon  nucleon final state interaction .",
    "the enhancement observed in the total cross section encouraged us to perform the high statistics measurements of the @xmath17 reaction in order to investigate a possible manifestation of the @xmath2-nucleon - nucleon dynamics in the occupation of the available phase - space . here",
    "we report on measurements of the @xmath17 reaction at an excess energy of q  =  15.5  mev .",
    "the large number of identified @xmath17 events ( 24000 ) permits a statistically significant determination of the differential cross sections .",
    "the acceptance of the detection system covers the full range of the @xmath2 meson center - of - mass polar scattering angles  @xcite , and enables to prove that at this excess energy  @xcite the @xmath2 meson is produced completely isotropically in the reaction center - of - mass system ( fig .",
    "[ dalitz_exp](left ) ) , as expected .",
    "figure  [ dalitz_exp](right ) presents the dalitz plot of the identified @xmath18 system corrected for the detection acceptance and the proton - proton final - state - interaction .",
    "one recognizes an increase of the occupation density at small values of @xmath19 .",
    "the observed effect is much stronger than the one obtained from the simulations performed under the assumption that the overall fsi effect can be separated from the primary production and that the overall enhancement factor can be factorized into the incoherent pairwise interactions .",
    "a deviation of the experimentally observed population of the phase - space from the expectation based on the mentioned assumptions is even better visible in figure  [ dsigmapodt ] .",
    "this figure presents the projection of the phase - space distribution onto the @xmath20 axis corresponding to the axis indicated by the arrows in the two parts of figure  [ dalitz_mc ] .",
    "the statistics allowed to identify the number of @xmath17 events in bins of 0.5  mev of the kinetic energy of protons @xmath21 in their rest frame . as an example the missing mass spectra corresponding to the large , small and middle values of @xmath21 are shown in figure  [ misski ] .    at each presented spectrum",
    "a signal originating from the @xmath1 reaction is evidently seen over a smooth distribution and allows for the model independent determination of the @xmath22 distribution  ( fig .",
    "[ dsigmapodt ] ) .",
    "the superimposed lines in figure  [ dsigmapodt ] correspond to the calculations performed under the assumption that the production amplitude can be factorized into primary production and the final state interaction .",
    "the solid lines depict calculations where only the proton - proton fsi was taken into account , whereas the dashed lines present results where the overall enhancement was factorized into the corresponding pair interactions of the @xmath18 system . in the left panel",
    "the enhancement factor accounting for the proton - proton fsi has been calculated as a square of the on - shell proton - proton scattering amplitude derived according to the modified cini - fubini - stanghellini formula including wong - noyes coulomb corrections  @xcite , whereas in the right panel the inverse of the jost function presented in references  @xcite was used .",
    "though the simple phenomenological treatment   based on the factorization of the production amplitude into the constant primary production and the on - shell incoherent pairwise interaction among the exit particles   works astonishingly well in case of the total cross section energy dependence  @xcite , it fails completely in the description of the differential cross section as can be inferred from figure  [ dsigmapodt](left ) .",
    "taking instead the inverse of the jost function as an enhancement factor of the proton - proton interaction , which should account approximately for the off - shell effects , one obtaines a much better agreement with the data .",
    "however , the experimentally determined structure is not satisfyingly reproduced , and calls for a more sophisticated theoretical interpretation .",
    "the preliminary theoretical study indicates that the effect is selective for the the primary production mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that the obtained results are in agreement with the observation performed by the tof collaboration using a completely different detection techinque  @xcite .",
