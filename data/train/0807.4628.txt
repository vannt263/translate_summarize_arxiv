    "the ising model in two dimensions with uncorrelated , quenched random - site or random - bond disorder is a paradigm for the study of the statistical mechanics of disordered systems . with moderate dilution , the random system exhibits a phase transition different to that of the pure system , and the nature of this transition has been investigated for over three decades .",
    "for the disordered ising models in two dimensions , two scenarios have arisen .",
    "the strong universality hypothesis maintains that the leading critical exponents remain the same as in the pure case and that the disorder induces multiplicative logarithmic corrections to scaling , while the weak universality hypothesis favours dilution - dependent leading critical exponents .",
    "while the former is now mostly favoured , especially in the random - bond ising model ( rbim ) , the debate regarding the scaling behaviour of the specific heat has persisted , especially in the site - diluted ising model ( rsim ) , focusing on whether this is characterised by an extremely weak double - logarithmic divergence or a finite cusp . indeed , according to the harris criterion  @xcite , the vanishing of the specific - heat critical exponent @xmath0 in the pure ising model , marks the borderline between the @xmath1 case , where disorder is relevant and where the critical exponents may change as random quenched disorder is added , and the @xmath2 scenario , where this type of disorder does not alter critical behaviour and the critical exponents are unchanged  @xcite . in this borderline circumstance ,",
    "logarithmic corrections to scaling ( distinct from the logarithmic divergence in the specific heat in the pure ising system ) may arise .",
    "the issue of scaling in the rsim is addressed here , as that is the more contentious version of the model .",
    "all of the thermodynamic information concerning a statistical mechanical system is contained in the locus and density of its partition function zeros  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the first numerical analysis of the lee - yang zeros in a disordered system ( the rsim ) was performed and the leading critical behaviour of the lowest lying lee - yang zeros was extracted through a finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis . a robust numerical technique to construct the density of zeros from simulational data was given in ref .",
    "finally , a self - consistent scaling theory which links the exponents characterising the logarithmic corrections to scaling was recently presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    ", these numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite advances are combined to unambiguously determine the leading scaling behaviour and potential multiplicative logarithmic corrections in the specific heat through the density of lee - yang zeros and the scaling relations .",
    "this and all multiplicative logarithmic correction - to - scaling exponents for fss of odd functions are zero .",
    "i.e. , there are no multiplicative logarithmic corrections for the fss of the magnetic susceptibility , the individual lee - yang zeros and the density of zeros .",
    "this comes about through the delicate manner in which the exponents of the logarithms , which are nonzero in thermal scaling , balance each other out .",
    "in this way , it is established that the lee - yang zeros of disordered systems can be precisely determined numerically , a density - of - zeros analysis is applicable to such a system , also at the level of logarithms , new scaling relations for the logarithmic corrections @xcite in this model are confirmed and a negative exponent for the contentious specific heat or its multiplicative logarithmic correction is made unlikely .",
    "recently a self - consistent scaling theory for logarithmic - correction exponents has been presented @xcite . denoting the reduced temperature by @xmath3 and the reduced external field by @xmath4",
    ", this theory deals with the circumstances where , in the absence of field , the specific heat , magnetization , susceptibility and correlation length scale respectively as @xmath5 at @xmath6 the magnetization scales with reduced field as @xmath7 the locus of lee - yang zeros along the imaginary @xmath4-axis is parameterized by @xmath8 and the yang - lee edge , which marks the end of their distribution , is denoted by @xmath9 . in the symmetric phase , this scales as @xmath10 while the density of these zeros along their locus ( @xmath11 ) at criticality ( @xmath6 ) behaves as @xcite @xmath12 the leading critical exponents are related by the standard scaling relations for continuous phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the theory presented in @xcite relates the exponents of the logarithmic corrections in an analogous manner .    with the strong universality hypothesis ,",
    "the leading critical exponents for the dilute ising models are identical to their pure counterparts : @xmath13 with gap exponent @xmath14 the latter equation has been verified in ref .",
    "the exponent @xmath15 characterizing the leading behaviour of the density of lee - yang zeros in eq.([g ] ) is @xcite @xmath16 which gives @xmath17 if the strong hypothesis ( [ leading ] ) and ( [ gap ] ) holds .",
    "shalaev @xcite and later shankar and ludwig @xcite , and then jug and shalaev @xcite , used field theory , bosonization techniques and conformal invariance to derive theoretical predictions for the logarithmic - correction exponents in the random - bond case with sufficiently small quenched dilution .",
    "these corrections , which we term the sslj exponents , are @xcite @xmath18 with specific heat diverging as a double logarithm @xcite @xmath19    the questions addressed in the literature over the past three decades concerned ( i ) the validity of the strong scaling hypothesis and the veracity of the leading exponents ( [ leading ] ) in the diluted cases , ( ii ) the validity of the theoretical derivation of the sslj correction exponents ( [ ssljscaling ] ) , which relies on certain assumptions regarding the nature of the dilution in the random - bond case ( see , also , ref .",
    "@xcite for the random - site case ) , ( iii ) whether these exponents are dilution independent , ( iv ) the vanishing of @xmath20 and the validity of the double logarithm in ( [ loglog ] ) , and ( v ) whether or not these sets of exponents also apply to the random - site version of the model .    for the two - dimensional random ising models ,",
    "an alternative scenario to ( i ) has persisted in the literature .",
    "this is the weak universality hypothesis and maintains that certain leading critical exponents change continuously as the concentration of impurity defects is increased @xcite . in particular , the exponents @xmath0 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are maintained to be dilution dependent while @xmath24 , @xmath25 and the ratios @xmath26 and @xmath27 remain independent of the dilution .",
    "furthermore , while agreeing with the sslj double - logarithmic form ( [ loglog ] ) for the specific heat , dotsenko and dotsenko ( dd ) used the renormaliztion group to predict  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a constant related to the concentration of disorder . while the sslj and dd predictions for the susceptibility differ substantially , it is fair to say that after much work by various authors the strong hypothesis is now mostly favoured ( especially in the random - bond model ) .",
    "the validity of the logarithmic - correction exponents ( [ ssljscaling ] ) proved harder to establish quantitatively .",
    "the first direct , clear , quantitative validation of the sslj prediction for the magnetic susceptibility ( that @xmath30 ) came in ref .",
    "@xcite through series expansions . while the detailed scaling behaviour of ( [ chidd ] ) has long been ruled out , the weak versus strong controversy persisted .",
    "in contrast to the susceptibility , dd and sslj agree on the double logarithmic behaviour of the specific heat .",
    "however , this has been notoriously difficult to confirm numerically , and has been the source of much controversy .",
    ".selection of recent works supportive of the weak or strong scaling hypothesis . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab4 ]",
    "the debate regarding the critical behaviour of the disordered ising model in two dimensions has persisted for over thirty years ( most recently in @xcite ) . here",
    "the sslj prediction @xcite for the multiplicative logarithmic corrections for the scaling behaviour of the susceptibility has been reconfirmed through a careful fss analysis .",
    "in addition to this , the lee - yang zeros have been determined to high accuracy and their logarithmic corrections verified for the first time .",
    "the scaling behaviour of the specific heat in the site - diluted version of the model has been particularly difficult to pin down directly , and fits to the measured specific heat as a function of the double logarithm of the lattice extent @xcite have been claimed not to be unambiguous @xcite . here an alternative approach has been taken , involving the density of lee - yang zeros . using scaling relations @xcite to connect to the even sector of the model , the specific - heat scaling and correction exponents are clearly determined . since the simulations are performed at three different values of the dilution ( some quite large ) the analyses presented herein for the susceptibility , the individual lee - yang zeros and for their densities , are unambiguously supportive of the strong scaling hypothesis .",
