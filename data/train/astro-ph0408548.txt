    "weak gravitational lensing by large - scale structure , or ` cosmic shear ' , has emerged as a powerful tool for measuring the mass distribution of the universe ( see van waerbeke & mellier 2003 ; refregier 2003 for recent reviews ) .",
    "this effect is based on the distortion induced in the images of background galaxies by the gravitational tidal field of the intervening large - scale structure . since light rays from nearby background galaxies travel through similar mass inhomogeneities along the way ,",
    "the resulting image distortions are correlated . by measuring the coherent lensing distortions of background galaxies , one can thus probe the mass distribution projected along the line of sight .",
    "the underlying physics is well - understood , and the observational signatures can be directly compared to theoretical predictions .",
    "the distortion depends on the mass fluctuations , as well as on the mean mass density of the universe . since it is a projected effect , the amplitude is also sensitive to the geometry of the universe and on the background source distribution in redshift space .",
    "the lensing distortion can be quantified by a @xmath13 tensor field , parameterized by the convergence and shear parameters , with the latter being the direct observable .",
    "since galaxies have an intrinsic shape distribution , the shear signal must be measured statistically , assuming galaxies are on average randomly oriented .",
    "the lensing effect of interest here is not associated with any specific mass concentrations , but is measured by sampling random regions of the sky .",
    "the typical amplitude of the shear in this regime is only on the order of a few percent on arcminute scales , and is therefore challenging to measure .",
    "large areas of the sky must be surveyed to reduce statistical errors , and systematic effects that spuriously distort the shape of the observed sources need to be carefully corrected for .",
    "the theoretical basis for cosmic shear was pioneered by gunn ( 1967 ) , and was further elaborated in a modern cosmology language by , e.g. , blandford et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , miralda - escude ( 1991 ) , kaiser ( 1992 , 1998 ) , jain and seljak ( 1997 ) , and schneider ( 1998 ) .",
    "because of its challenging observational nature , cosmic shear was firmly detected for the first time only recently ( bacon et al .",
    "2000 ; kaiser et al .",
    "2000 ; van waerbeke , et al . 2000 ; wittman et al .",
    "since then , the cosmological origin and implications of the shear signal have been rapidly established by many more groups ( most recently bacon et al 2003 ; brown et al .",
    "2003 ; hamana et al .",
    "2003 ; hoekstra et al . 2002 ; jarvis et al . 2003 ; refregier et al . 2002 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "collectively , the shear two - point statistics have been measured from @xmath14 to @xmath15 angular scales , spanning the non - linear ( @xmath16 ) and quasi - linear ( @xmath17 ) regime of the matter power spectrum , and are consistent with predictions from the popular @xmath18cdm model .",
    "constraints on the matter density @xmath19 and the power spectrum normalization @xmath10 from different cosmic shear measurements are broadly in agreement with one another , and are roughly consistent with measurements from the cluster abundance method ( e.g. , pierpaoli et al .",
    "2001 ; seljak 2002 ) .    until now",
    ", all current cosmic shear measurements have been performed in the optical and near - infrared bands , with similar observational and analysis techniques . here , we report a cosmic shear measurement using the _ first _ radio survey ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ; white et al .",
    "_ first _ is a quarter - sky radio survey at 1.4 ghz conducted using the very large array ( vla ) in its b - configuration , and therefore provides a unique measurement of the mass power spectrum on large angular scales ( kamionkowski et al .",
    "1998 ; refregier et al . 1998",
    "; chang & refregier 2002 ) .",
    "radio surveys like _ first _ offer several advantages for cosmic shear .",
    "firstly , unlike optical galaxies , bright radio sources are typically at high redshifts , thereby increasing the path - length to each through the universe , and thus the strength of the lensing signal .",
    "secondly , the vla is a radio interferometer and thus has a well - known and deterministic beam , allowing for modeling of crucial systematic effects to high accuracy .",
    "in contrast , ground - based optical surveys are limited by the irreproducible effects of atmospheric seeing . finally ,",
    "first _ is a sparsely - sampled but wide - angle survey , well - suited for measurements in the linear part of the mass power spectrum .",
    "this avoids the theoretical uncertainties arising from the non - linear corrections of the mass power spectrum required to interpret the optical cosmic shear surveys that are sensitive to smaller scales .    to deal with the important issue of accurate shear measurements and systematics corrections , we use the shapelet method described in chang & refregier ( 2002 , hereafter cr02 ; see also refregier 2003b ; refregier & bacon 2003 ) to measure the shape and shear information from interferometric data directly in fourier space .",
    "the method is linear and yields unbiased shear estimators .",
    "systematic effects such as instrumental distortions can be closely modeled .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in  [ formalism ]",
    "we describe the theoretical background and notations for cosmic shear . in  [ data ] , we summarize the main features of the first radio survey and the properties of its radio sources . in ",
    "[ method ] , we describe briefly our shape measurement method , discussing the impact of systematic effects in  [ systematics ] .",
    "the systematics corrections are described in  [ sys_corrections ] . in  [ results ] , we present our results for the measurement of cosmic shear , and discuss their cosmological implications .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  [ conclusion ] .",
    "we first briefly describe the theoretical basis of cosmic shear and the statistics we will use to present our results ( see , e.g. , bartelmann & schneider 2000 for a review ) .      in a weakly inhomogeneous frw universe ,",
    "light rays from distant sources are deflected by the gravitational tidal field of intervening structures . in the weak - lensing limit",
    ", the resulting distortion and magnification can be quantified by a @xmath13 tensor field , @xmath20 , which , following from the geodesic equation , can be related to the gravitational potential @xmath21 : @xmath22 where the radial window function @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the normalized source redshift distribution , @xmath26 is the comoving angular - diameter distance , @xmath27 is the radial comoving coordinate , and @xmath28 corresponds to the horizon .",
    "the comoving derivatives @xmath29 are perpendicular to the line - of - sight .",
    "the symmetric distortion tensor @xmath20 can be parameterized by the convergence , @xmath30 , and the shear @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "these are defined as @xmath33 adding to equation ( [ eqn : kappa ] ) a @xmath34 term which cancels out upon @xmath27 integration , and using poisson s equation in the form of @xmath35 , one relates the convergence field @xmath30 to the density fluctuation @xmath36 , weighted by the window function @xmath23 . applying limber s equation in fourier - space , the power spectrum of convergence , @xmath37 , can then be expressed in terms of the 3-d mass power spectrum , @xmath38 ( e.g. , kaiser 1992 ) as @xmath39^{2 } p_{\\delta } \\left({l \\over r(\\chi)};\\chi \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the mass - density fluctuation , @xmath40 is the cosmological scale factor , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the present - day hubble constant and matter density parameter , respectively . note that the convergence and shear fields are related by ( e.g. , kaiser & squires 1993 ) @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the inverse 2d laplacian operator @xmath45 in the flat sky approximation , the convergence power spectrum is equal to the shear power spectrum @xmath46 .",
    "the shear power spectrum is simply related to other 2-point shear statistics which are more convenient in practice and which we describe below .      for each pair of galaxies ,",
    "we define the tangential and @xmath47-rotated shear components , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with respect to the great circle connecting the two galaxies : as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the position angle between the x - axis and the great circle . in analogy to the cmb polarization correlations , one",
    "can then construct coordinate - independent correlations from the rotated shear components ( kamionkowski et al .",
    "there are three independent pair - wise shear correlation functions , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the first two correlation functions are related to the shear power spectrum ( e.g. , miralda - escude 1991 ) @xmath55 \\\\ c_2(\\theta)&=&\\int { ldl \\over 4\\pi } p_\\gamma(l ) [ j_0(l\\theta)-j_4(l\\theta)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the parity invariance of weak lensing ensures that @xmath56 vanishes .",
    "the measurement of a non - zero @xmath56 is , therefore , an indication of a non - lensing contribution , such as that from residual systematics .",
    "the aperture mass is defined as ( kaiser 1995 ; schneider et al . 1998 ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a compensated filter defined so that @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the convergence field .",
    "the @xmath57 statistic thus measures the spatially - filtered projected density field , and can be conveniently related to the shear as @xmath62 where @xmath63 , and @xmath48 is the rotated tangential shear , as in eq.([eqn : sheart ] ) , with respect to the aperture center .",
    "the aperture mass variance is related to the shear power spectrum by ( schneider et al .",
    "1998 ) : @xmath64 ^ 2.\\ ] ]    the @xmath57 statistic has the advantage that the mass density can be directly obtained from the observables  the shear  without the need for mass reconstruction .",
    "the weight function @xmath65 is relatively narrow in fourier space , so that the @xmath66 measurements do not strongly correlate .",
    "as a result , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are almost independent of each other .",
    "note that @xmath66 probes the scale of @xmath68 ( schneider 1998 ) .",
    "weak gravitational lensing arises from scalar perturbations to the space - time metric , and therefore the shear field is expected to possess no handedness .",
    "one can decompose the shear tensor field into gradient ( e - mode ) and curl ( b - mode ) components ( stebbins 1996 ) .",
    "the gradient part contains the weak lensing signal , while the curl part is expected to be zero .",
    "gravitational waves produce non - zero b - mode signals , but their effect is expected to be very small .",
    "thus , the b - mode provides a useful check for any non - lensing contaminations , such as residual systematic effects or intrinsic shape correlations ( e.g. , heavens 2001 ) . a rotation of 45 degrees in the aperture brings a curl - free field to a curl field , and also transforms a tangential shear to a radial shear component .",
    "thus , the b - mode of the aperture mass , @xmath69 , is simply @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the radial shear with respect to the aperture center .",
    "the aperture mass statistic therefore provides a convenient way for e- and b - mode decomposition , and can be computed directly from the observed shear .",
    "the aperture mass variance can also be expressed in terms of the shear correlation functions .",
    "defining @xmath72 the aperture masses are given by @xmath73 \\\\",

    "the first radio survey ( becker et al . 1995 ; white et al . 1997 ) was conducted at the nrao very large array ( vla ) at 1.4 ghz in the b configuration .",
    "the survey is the radio equivalent of the sloan digital sky survey covering @xmath76 deg@xmath77 of the northern galactic cap .",
    "it consists of 3-minute snapshots covering a hexagonal grid using 14 3-mhz frequency channels .",
    "its @xmath78 flux density limit is 1 mjy , with a restoring beam fwhm of @xmath79 .",
    "the survey contains @xmath80 sources , roughly 40% of which are resolved .",
    "the basic source information is described in the on - line first catalog ( http://sundog.stsci.edu/ ) .      for our weak lensing measurement ,",
    "the source redshift distribution determines the weight function along the line of sight , and thus conditions the strength of the lensing signal .",
    "the signal depends most strongly on the source median redshift @xmath7 and somewhat on the redshift distribution . as discussed below",
    ", the redshift distribution for radio sources is rather uncertain , and we have therefore considered @xmath7 as a free parameter throughout the paper .    for our purposes , we consider the redshift distribution for radio sources estimated by dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ; hereafter dp ) .",
    "these authors estimated the radio luminosity functions ( rlf ) for the steep- and flat - spectrum sources at 2.7 ghz , using faint sources with optical counterparts in the ugc catalog and the parkes selected regions database with source flux densities @xmath81 mjy .",
    "they presented seven redshift models , with model 7 considered with two cases : mean- and high - redshift source distributions .",
    "the former have assigned redshifts that are the mean values for galaxies of a given k - band luminosity , and the latter have redshifts larger than the average , to account for a possible bias .",
    "the normalized differential redshift distribution of the dp models is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndz ] .",
    "the rlf s were integrated over luminosities that produce flux densities greater than 1 mjy .",
    "the dp models were shifted to 1.4 ghz for computation , assuming a spectral index of @xmath82 for steep - spectrum sources and @xmath83 for flat - spectrum sources , where @xmath84 .",
    "the dp model 1 is the fundamental model , and models 2 to 5 are variations relative to it . for clarity ,",
    "only the averaged values of models 2 to 5 are shown .",
    "the high redshift end was truncated at @xmath85 , as models 4 and 5 have unphysical spikes at @xmath86 .",
    "model 7 includes effects of source evolution in luminosity and density , and is considered the most probable approximation ( magliocchetti et al .",
    "the spike near @xmath87 is due to starburst galaxies ; however , optical follow - up observations suggest the spike is probably unphysical ( magliocchetti et al .",
    "the vertical bars show the median redshifts for each model ( truncated at @xmath85 ) which range from @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "we summarize the relevant components of the shapelet method described in cr02 . in this approach ,",
    "the surface brightness @xmath90 of an object is decomposed as @xmath91 where the fourier transform of the basis functions are given by @xmath92^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\ ] ] representing the two - dimensional orthonormal gauss - hermite basis functions of characteristic scale @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the hermite polynomial of order m , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "in practice , the series only include a finite number of terms with order @xmath97 .",
    "the decomposition and its applications have also been studied by refregier ( 2003 ) , refregier & bacon ( 2003 ) and independently by bernstein & jarvis ( 2002 ) .",
    "the bases are complete and yield fast convergence in the expansion if @xmath93 and @xmath98 are close to the size and location of the object , respectively .",
    "the basis functions can be thought of as perturbations around a two - dimensional gaussian , so that the coefficients are the gaussian - weighted moments of the source .",
    "the basis functions are also the eigenfunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator . under a linear coordinate transformation , such as a weak shear ,",
    "the basis functions have analytic responses , making an unbiased shear estimator easy to construct from the coefficients .",
    "furthermore , the basis functions are their own fourier transforms up to a rescaling factor ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : duality ] below ) , and are thus localized functions in both real and fourier spaces .",
    "they are thus convenient for analyzing data from interferometers , which measure the fourier - transform of the sky surface brightness .    making use of the basis functions",
    ", we model the source intensity directly in the fourier ( or @xmath1 ) space , where the first interferometric data ( visibilities ) are collected .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath99 of object intensity @xmath100 of each source @xmath101 is a sum of the fourier shapelets basis functions @xmath102 where @xmath103 a @xmath104 fit is used to simultaneously model all sources in the field : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the binned visibility data vector , @xmath107 is the theory matrix whose components are the basis functions of different order @xmath108 evaluated at the respective source @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is the coefficient vector for all sources .",
    "we assume the data error matrix @xmath111 is diagonal and constant , @xmath112 , where @xmath4 is the noise level and @xmath113 the identity matrix ; this is a reasonable approximation for the vla observations since the noise of antennas is independent . to find the best - fit solution",
    ", we solve a set of simultaneous least - squares equations .",
    "the covariance matrix of the best - fit coefficients @xmath114 is then @xmath115 which provides an estimate of the errors on the coefficients and can be used to compute the errors of derived quantities , such as source flux density and size , and the shear estimator . in ",
    "[ params ] below , we explain how the shapelet centroid , scale @xmath93 , and maximum order @xmath116 are chosen in practice .",
    "an unbiased shear estimator for each source and for each shapelet order @xmath117 is then given by ( refregier & bacon 2003 ) @xmath118^{\\frac{1}{2 } } } \\frac{\\hat{f}_{n,2}}{\\langle \\hat{f}_{n-2,0}-\\hat{f}_{n+2,0 } \\rangle}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 is the complex shear , and the brackets denote an average over an unlensed object ensemble .",
    "the coefficients @xmath120 are the complex polar shapelet coefficients which are related to the cartesian coefficients of equation  ( [ eq : cartesian ] ) by a simple linear transformation ( see refregier 2003b ) . in this paper",
    ", we will only consider the @xmath121 shear estimator @xmath122 , which captures most of the shape information of faint radio sources .",
    "the error on the shear estimator can be straight - forwardly propagated from the covariance matrix .",
    "one issue which needs to be resolved is the choice of the shapelet parameters ",
    "@xmath93 , @xmath123 and centroid  for each source .",
    "the shapelets centroid was simply chosen to match the source centroid position in r.a . and",
    "dec . listed in the first catalog , converted into @xmath124 coordinates .    to generate this conversion",
    ", we note that the r.a . and",
    "coordinate system , also called the @xmath125 coordinate system , is fixed to the earth .",
    "it is defined so that the @xmath126 axes define the plane of the equator and the @xmath127 axis points along the rotation axis of the earth .",
    "the @xmath124 system is identical to the @xmath128 system , and is defined , for a given pointing , so that the @xmath129 axis points towards the phase tracking center and the @xmath130 axis is in the @xmath126 plane .",
    "let @xmath131 and @xmath36 be the hour angle and declination of a source .",
    "its coordinate in the @xmath125 system is then @xmath132 .",
    "the corresponding coordinates in the @xmath128 coordinate system are then given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the hour angle and declination of the phase tracking center for this pointing .",
    "if the source is at the phase tracking center ( @xmath136 ) , the position on the @xmath128 system is @xmath137 , as expected since @xmath124 are directional cosines such that @xmath138 . for small displacements @xmath139 away from the phase tracking center , the @xmath140 position takes the familiar form @xmath141 to first order in the displacement .",
    "the choice of @xmath93 and @xmath123 is important to ensure that each source is faithfully modeled , that the shapelet series converges , and that our shape measurement is unbiased . to study the first two issues , we ran a series of simulated grid pointings with the observing conditions of first , as described in cr02 .",
    "the input sources are described by elliptical gaussians with major axes , minor axes , and position angles taken from the first catalog .",
    "note that this choice of source model is simplistic and facilitates the convergence of the shapelet series .",
    "this is however the standard model used in radio astronomy to parameterize radio sources . in particular , this parameterization is adopted by the source fitting software used to generate the first catalog , and is therefore a natural model to use for our simulations",
    ". this choice may affect the exact values of beta and @xmath123 derived , but it will not bias our final shear estimator as long as these parameters are within the acceptable range ( see figure  [ fig : nmax_beta ] ) . in cr02 , we tested our shapelet reconstruction algorithm in detail and found that it also performs well for more complicated source models .    with these simulation , we then considered a series of values of @xmath93 and @xmath123 for one of the sources in the pointing , while keeping these parameters constant for the other sources ( all centroids were also kept fixed ) .",
    "we also added in noise in the @xmath1 plane , and studied the behavior of sources with different sn ratios .",
    "the added noise level is equal to 0.15 mjy per beam in real space , which is the typical noise level for first .",
    "the lowest sn ratio considered is 5 , which corresponds to the first detection limit ; we explored over two orders of magnitudes of sn ratios , covering the range appropriate for first sources . from the reconstructed images , we find a moderately narrow range of parameters which yield sensible reconstructions . to quantify this range , we computed the @xmath142 difference between the input image @xmath143 and the fitted image @xmath144 defined as @xmath145^{2 } } { \\sigma^{2}_{f{\\rm in } } n_{\\rm pix } } , \\ ] ] where the sum is over all @xmath146 pixels within a radius of @xmath147 about the centroid .",
    "for convenience , @xmath104 was normalized by the rms @xmath148 of the pixel distribution of @xmath149 .",
    "an example of the resulting dependence of @xmath142 on @xmath93 and @xmath123 is shown in figure  [ fig : nmax_beta ] , where the sn ratio was set to a high value of 500 in this case .",
    "the range of acceptable parameter values is reflected as the region with @xmath150 on the figure , showing that @xmath142 is a good measure of the reconstruction . in this case ,",
    "the best reconstruction is near @xmath151 . in the presence of noise",
    ", the best reconstruction tends to favor smaller @xmath123 values while leaving the best @xmath93 unchanged .",
    "we have repeated the above procedure for various sources in different simulated first grids .",
    "this allowed us to relate the optimal @xmath93 and @xmath123 values to the major and minor axes of the sources derived from the elliptical gaussian fits listed in the first catalog .",
    "we thus derived an empirical relation between the observed shape parameters in the first catalog ( the deconvolved major and minor axes ) and the optimal shapelets parameters ( @xmath93 and @xmath123 ) for the source ensemble : @xmath152 , and @xmath153 , where @xmath154 and @xmath155 denote the fwhm of the major and minor axes .",
    "this recipe was then applied to the real sources in the first survey .    to test the implementation of this recipe in our shear measurement method",
    ", we have performed further simulations .",
    "elliptical gaussian sources were first generated with source parameters following the distribution of the real sources in the first catalog .",
    "these artificial sources were then sheared with a constant 5% value for both @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding visibilities with the first survey settings were generated for over 1,000 simulated pointings with @xmath156 sources per pointing .",
    "we then used the above recipe to determine the shapelet parameters , and applied the method described in cr02 to calculate the shapelet coefficients for the @xmath157 30,000 synthetic sources .",
    "the estimators for @xmath31 and @xmath32 of each source were then calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : shear ] ) applied to different flux - size bins .",
    "we find that the input shear amplitudes are accurately recovered within the @xmath9 statistical errors .",
    "we also performed a null simulation ( with zero shear ) and verified that the resulting shear measurement was consistent with zero .",
    "given a set of first flux- and phase - calibrated @xmath1 data , sources positioned within a radius of @xmath158 from the phase center are selected from the first catalog .",
    "this large radius limit ensures bright sources in the primary beam side lobes are also included in the simultaneous fit and thus do not contaminate the fainter sources within the primary beam .",
    "sources which are separated by less than @xmath159 are merged into one source , as simulations show that treating close companions as one source yields the best shapelet fits ( see also the discussion in ",
    "[ fragment ] ) .",
    "the shapelet parameters are determined according to the prescription described in ",
    "[ params ] .",
    "we then compute the source shapelet coefficients and their covariance matrix using a least - squares fit to the visibilities , where all sources in a given pointing are fitted simultaneously . in principle , some of the systematics that distort the shape of sources could be corrected for at this stage .",
    "however , to save computing time , we decided to correct for the systematics afterwards , as described in the next section .",
    "the whole first data set observed up to year 2001 were processed on the uk cosmos supercomputer .",
    "the total of about 50,000 individual pointings required about 9,000 hours of cosmos cpu time .    as a first check ,",
    "the output coefficients were examined by computing the source fluxes and centroids derived from the shapelet coefficients ( see cr02 ) . along with those fields flagged when the fit failed to converge ,",
    "we have discarded about @xmath160 of the processed sources , due to corrupted observational data , numerical convergence problems and , in a few cases , inadequate choice of input shapelet parameters . on average ,",
    "the computed shapelet flux densities and centroids agree rather well with those in the first catalog , which used an elliptical gaussian fit to measure source intensities and positions .",
    "the shapelet flux densities and flux density errors were then combined to compute the signal - to - noise ratio of each source . to control systematics , we discarded measurements with observing parameters @xmath161 hours and @xmath162 , and only kept sources with an integrated flux density @xmath163 1mjy and deconvolved major axis @xmath164 .",
    "excluding the measurements for point sources ( deconvolved major axis @xmath165 ) , we thus were left with @xmath166 usable shear estimators with associated measurement errors .    since the first pointings partially overlap ( see becker et al .",
    "1995 for details ) , each source is observed from one to four times .",
    "we verified that the corrected shear estimators of a given source in different pointings are consistent within the errors .",
    "the shear estimators of a given source are then coadded using the square of the observed signal - to - noise ratio as a weight .",
    "the sky coverage in the northern cap is close to 8000 @xmath167 , and the resulting resolved ( major axis @xmath168 and",
    "@xmath169 ) source number density is about 20 sources @xmath170 .",
    "because the weak - lensing signal is only on the order of 1% , systematic effects must be carefully accounted for , as they may otherwise introduce spurious shear correlations .",
    "the dominant systematics arise from the anisotropy of the synthesized beam , which is directly related to the @xmath1 sampling , and thus on the geometry of the interferometric array .",
    "note that , unlike the case with optical observations , systematic effects in our case are well - known and deterministic ( albeit somewhat complicated ) and can be calculated to high - degree of accuracy . in the following ,",
    "we briefly describe the different sources of systematic effects and show that they are best viewed as functions of four observing parameters ( see e.g. , perley et al .",
    "1989 ; taylor et al . 1999 ; & thompson et al .",
    "1986 for a detailed description of these effects ) .",
    "interferometric data are collected in fourier space , or @xmath1 space , at a finite and discrete number of points .",
    "the fourier - transform of the sky surface brightness is thus multiplied by the @xmath1 sampling function which determines the shape and size of the convolution beam ( psf ) in real - space .",
    "the @xmath1 sampling function is deterministic and is a sum of delta functions centered on the positions @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the observing wavelength , @xmath173 are the vla antenna spacings , and @xmath174 and @xmath36 are the source hour - angle and declination . since the former two are fixed and known for a given observation , the effective beam can thus be calculated exactly from the source position on the sky .",
    "this can be seen as the projection of the antenna plane onto the @xmath1 plane , which depends on the source position .    with the knowledge of the @xmath1 sampling function , we place a point source at the phase - tracking center and generate simulated visibilities using the first observing settings .",
    "the simulated visibilities are modeled using the shapelet method , and the artificial shear of the simulated source due to systematics are calculated using the fitted shapelet coefficients .",
    "we then repeat the procedure for various values of @xmath175 . the resulting shape distortion is shown in fig [ fig : hadec ] .",
    "the distortion is minimal at small hour angles and at declination near 34 degrees , corresponding to the latitude of the vla , when sources are directly overhead .",
    "the induced distortion is @xmath176 at @xmath177 , roughly in the radial direction with respect to @xmath178 .",
    "the vla is a two - dimensional array laid out across the surface of the earth .",

    "the @xmath129 term is small and is often dropped . in this approximation",
    "the visibility function reduces to a two - dimensional fourier transform @xmath181},\\ ] ] which has the advantage of allowing fast computation .",
    "this approximation induces a distortion of the source images that depends on the amplitude of @xmath182 , i.e. , on the distance from the phase tracking center @xmath183 .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the amplitude of @xmath129 depends on the source observing hour angle and declination .",
    "thus , the shape distortion due to the two - dimensional approximation is a function of the source position @xmath184 with respect to the phase center , as well as the observing hour angle and declination . in our shapelet approach ,",
    "we use the two - dimensional approximation in order to save computing time , and therefore the distortion must be corrected for .",
    "we quantify this distortion using simulations similar to that described in ",
    "[ hadec ] , but with sources placed at various off - center positions in the simulated grid using equation  ( [ eq : non_coplanar ] ) .",
    "[ fig : noncoplanar ] shows an example of the resulting distortion pattern , for which the simulated source is placed at ( @xmath185,@xmath186)=@xmath187 . in this setting ,",
    "the distortion at @xmath188 is @xmath189 , and is roughly in the radial direction with respect to@xmath190 .",
    "this effect is the dominant source of systematic effects ( see  [ simulations ] ) .",
    "the bandwidth - smearing effect with interferometers is exactly analogous to chromatic aberration in an optical telescope .",
    "it is due to the fact that radio interferometric observations are not monochromatic , but are instead done within a finite frequency band . as a result , the visibility registered at a particular @xmath1 position is actually an average of the actual visibilities over a small interval of @xmath191 positions extended in the radial direction .",
    "the delay tracking , which corrects for the difference in arrival time of light rays at two antennas prior to correlation of the signals , is only accurate at the center of the field - of - view and at the central observing frequency .",
    "suppose that the observing central frequency is @xmath192 and the phase tracking center is @xmath193 .",
    "signals at frequency @xmath194 arriving from sky position @xmath195 will have a phase delay error of @xmath196 , resulting in a phase shift of @xmath197 .",
    "the smeared visibilities , @xmath198 , are thus ( perley et al .",
    "1994 ) @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the passband function and @xmath201 . for simplicity ,",
    "here and in the following , we ignore the effect of the primary beam power pattern and the weighting function in the @xmath1 plane . in real space",
    ", this corresponds to a convolution of the true sky intensity , @xmath202 , with a distortion function @xmath203 , such as @xmath204 , where @xmath203 is defined as @xmath205,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provided that the fractional bandwidth is sufficiently small .",
    "the amplitude of bandwidth - smearing distortion therefore depends on the source position ( with respect to the phase tracking center ) , and on the size of the frequency interval .",
    "since a change in frequency moves the @xmath1 points radially on the @xmath1 plane , bandwidth smearing distorts the observed images in the radial direction with respect to the field center .",
    "for first , @xmath200 can be approximated by a square passband with a width of 3 mhz .",
    "the distortion induced @xmath206 away from the center of the field - of - view is about 6% .",
    "the resulting shear pattern is shown in figure  [ fig : bandwid ] .",
    "time - averaging smearing is another systematic effect that results from data averaging .",
    "correlated signals received by pairs of antennas are , in practice , averaged over small time intervals in order to reduce the size of the visibility files . during a time - interval @xmath207",
    ", the earth rotates by an angle of @xmath208 , where @xmath209 is the earth angular rotation velocity . for observations at a declination of @xmath210 , the earth rotation corresponds to a tangential rotation in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "the true visibilities are therefore averaged over an interval of @xmath1 positions , extended tangentially , which results in a tangential distortion of images in real space .",
    "the time - averaging effect at declination @xmath210 thus bears an interesting analogy to the bandwidth smearing effect , which distorts images in the radial direction .    in general , however , the time averaging effect is more complex .",
    "depending on the source position relative to the antenna ( earth ) space , the loci on the @xmath1 plane over which visibilities are being averaged varies in length and shape . a convenient way to estimate",
    "the size of image distortion is to calculate the response of a point source .",
    "since the time averaging effect preserves the integrated flux density , the induced tangential broadening must be compensated for by the reduction in the peak amplitude of the point source response .",
    "averaging a waveform of frequency @xmath194 over a time interval @xmath211 reduces the amplitude of the response by sinc@xmath212 , for @xmath213 , where @xmath214 corresponds to the phase change . for a source at @xmath184 with respect to the phase - tracking center ,",
    "the instantaneous phase rate is @xmath215 , and therefore , integrating over a small time interval @xmath207 , the reduction of the amplitude of the point source response is @xmath216 where @xmath217 which follows directly from equation  ( [ eqn : uvw ] ) , and @xmath218 .    combining the above two equations , we can estimate the reduction of response for sources at any given observing coordinates @xmath219 .",
    "the amplitude of the tangential width broadening due to time - averaging smearing is then simply @xmath220 . the distortion is therefore a function of the antenna configuration ( @xmath221 and @xmath222 ) , the source position in the sky ( the hour angle and declination ) , and the source position with respect to the center of the field - of - view @xmath184 .    for first , the averaging time - interval is five seconds . the resulting distortion pattern for @xmath223 in shown in figure  [ fig : timeave ] .",
    "the distortion from time averaging smearing is small in the first settings ; for most sources the distortion is less than 0.1% .          in practice ,",
    "the true sky surface brightness @xmath202 is multiplied by the antenna power pattern of the primary single dish @xmath224 before signals are correlated . the primary beam power pattern is closely related to the diffraction pattern of a circular dish , and can be approximated by ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the bessel @xmath227 function of order 1 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229 is the fwhm of the primary beam pattern .",
    "for first , @xmath230 .",
    "the primary beam pattern introduces a variation in sensitivity in the radial direction across the observing field - of - view which modifies the observed shape of source images .",
    "a general treatment of this effect is detailed in the appendix .",
    "the effect depends on the primary beam power pattern as well as on the source sizes ; for larger sources the distortion is more severe . using equations ( [ eqn : pbeam ] ) and ( [ eqn : epbeam ] )",
    ", we calculate the effect for typical first sources .",
    "the distortion is in the radial direction with respect to the field center , and the induced shear pattern for a circular gaussian source with fwhm of @xmath231 ( @xmath232 times the beam size ) is shown in fig  [ fig : pbeam ] .",
    "the distortion is less than 0.01% and thus the effect can be safely ignored in the first case .",
    "a significant fraction of radio sources have a double - lobe structure , and are often broken into two components by the first object finder . because these radio lobes tend to be aligned , this produces strong shear correlations on small angular scales . as mentioned in ",
    "[ implementation ] , we have treated sources within @xmath159 of each other , the typical separation of double - lobe sources , as a single source for the shapelet fitting . furthermore , for sources that lie within @xmath233 , only one source is selected at random for use in the shear measurements .",
    "this leads to a loss of information only on scales smaller than @xmath233 , a scale much smaller than the scales on which we measure the weak lensing signal ( greater than about @xmath234 ; see  [ results ] below )",
    "without correction , the shear measurements of our first sample are dominated by the systematic effects described above .",
    "these effects are complicated and are correlated with each other , and can not easily be decomposed into convolutions and distortions , as is the case with optical observations . to correct them , we therefore adopt a statistical approach by measuring and subtracting the systematic shear as a function of the observation parameters ( ra , dec , l , m ) and of the source size . as a test",
    ", we also apply the same procedure to the simulations .    figs .",
    "[ fig : data_hadec]a and [ fig : data_xy]a show the average of the shear estimators for each of the @xmath235 measurements ( with major axis @xmath168 and @xmath236 before coaddition ) in ha - dec and l - m bins for all source sizes . since the lensing signal averages out in these cells ( see  [ corrections ] for more details ) , the resulting patterns give a measure of the systematics .",
    "the ha - dec plane shows a large - scale pattern in @xmath237 degree bins .",
    "most ( 75% ) of the measurements concentrate in the central two ha columns , @xmath238 , which have the highest statistical accuracy .",
    "the shear pattern in the l - m plane is less prominent , and shows a predominantly vertical pattern .",
    "the measurements are more evenly distributed in this plane , although the number density decreases at larger radii .",
    "note that all measurements with @xmath239hrs and @xmath162 have been excluded at an earlier stage .",
    "the systematics shown in these two planes are coupled : the minimum shear distortion occurs at around @xmath240 , dec  @xmath241 , where sources are directly overhead from the vla , and at the phase tracking center @xmath242 .",
    "the farther away from these two central values , the greater the spurious shear due to systematics .",
    "we also examined the dependence of the systematics on the source size cuts , and found that smaller sources are subject to larger systematic distortions , as expected .",
    "we do not find any significant dependence on observation epoch over the eight years of the observing campaign .          as discussed in ",
    "[ systematics ] , the largest systematic distortions for first are the coupled ha - dec and non - coplanar effects , which produce as much as @xmath157 50% artificial shear when a source combines low declination , with an observation at large hour angle , and at a position far from the phase tracking center .",
    "another important contribution is from the bandwidth - smearing effect , which produces @xmath157 6% shear @xmath206 from the phase tracking center .",
    "although the systematic effects are well - understood and calculable to high accuracy , their impact on the shear statistics is complicated , since source observations do not uniformly occupy the ha - dec - l - m space and since we apply complicated cuts during the analysis .    ideally , we could use a control sample , such as point sources , to quantify the systematic effects and check our correction method .",
    "since point sources carry no lensing information , any measured shear must indeed be due to systematic effects .",
    "however , in our shapelets approach , the shear estimators require fitting coefficients up to @xmath243 ( eq . [ eqn : shear ] ) , which is a poor choice of input parameter for point sources ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : nmax_beta ] ) .",
    "this not only compromises the fits for point sources , but also affects the reconstruction of resolved sources , since all sources in a given field are fitted simultaneously .",
    "although we could imagine increasing the size of @xmath93 for point sources to yield a more reasonable fit , this would be difficult to implement given the presence of other sources ( leaving aside the problem of quantifying the effects on these sources ) .",
    "in addition , this would have meant doubling the fitting parameters in the model and thus doubling the computing time , which was already substantial .",
    "more importantly , the systematic effects can in fact be understood and calculated very accurately , as we will see below .",
    "the averaged data described in the previous section also serves as another check for systematics . to quantify the systematics at the required precision , we therefore have carried out further simulations to study the impact on the shear statistics .    for this purpose , we consider the ha - dec , non - coplanar , and bandwidth - smearing effects and ignore the other effects , which are at least one order of magnitude smaller in amplitude , or have been incorporated directly in the analysis ( such as the source fragmentation effect ) .",
    "using the first catalog , we begin by randomizing the source position angles , which , along with the major and minor axis information , gives a measure of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution . for every source , we computed the combined systematic distortions listed above for each individual observation ; the result is subsequently convolved with the source s intrinsic shape and multiple observations are coadded .",
    "to avoid large computing time , we calculated the systematics on a grid in ha - dec - l - m space , and interpolate between the grid positions .",
    "examples are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : data_hadec]b and [ fig : data_xy]b , where we average the simulated measurements in the same ha - dec and l - m bins as for the observations .",
    "the resulting shear patterns and amplitudes are almost identical to those of the data ( see figs . [",
    "fig : data_hadec]a and [ fig : data_xy]a excepting for the l - m patterns which show small discrepancies at the edges of the field where the data are of low statistical significance .",
    "we are therefore confident that the systematics estimation is , at least on average , a good representation of the true systematics for individual sources .",
    "we compute the rotated shear correlation functions , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , and @xmath246 , as described in ",
    "[ formalism ] , for both the simulation and the data .",

    "we divide the data into twelve subsamples according to their sky position , and compute the correlation functions separately .",

[ fig : data_correlation]a and [ fig : data_correlation]b , the general behaviors of the @xmath256 and @xmath257 functions for the data and of the simulation are in very good agreement from @xmath258 to @xmath259 . for the @xmath260 function",
    ", the simulation captures the large - scale behavior well but does less well on small angular scales .",
    "it is nevertheless reassuring that our knowledge of the systematics is realistic .",
    "note that the measurements of @xmath244 and @xmath245 on different angular scales in fig.[fig : data_correlation ] appear correlated both for the data and for the simulations .",
    "this reflects the fact that the systematics , which dominate @xmath244 and @xmath245 before the corrections , are strongly correlated within a patch of the sky used to measure the correlation functions .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath246 ( for @xmath261 ) is less correlated , and therefore its errors are dominated by statistical uncertainties .",
    "first , let us re - examine the averaged shear pattern on the ha - dec plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : data_hadec]a ) .",
    "it is evident that this large - scale pattern is contributed almost entirely by systematics .",
    "using the averaged data , we fit a two - dimensional 2nd - order polynomial to this plane , and subsequently subtract the fitted systematics from individual sources .",
    "the sources are grouped according to their sizes and observed l - m position in the field for the modeling and the corrections .",
    "we have tried both polynomial fits and spline fits to the systematics and find that the resulting residuals are comparable . the residual shear pattern is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data_hadec_correct ] and appears small in amplitude and random in orientation , as desired .",
    "we discard measurements with averaged residual shear values greater than 1.5% in all following analyses . to test for our control of the systematics ,",
    "we perform the same procedure with the simulated shears ; the residual shear pattern is random and very small in amplitude .",
    "we then study the shear correlations function after the ha - dec corrections for both the data and the simulation .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corre_bins]a , the amplitudes of the data @xmath244 and @xmath245 correlations are an order - of - magnitude smaller than those of the uncorrected data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : data_correlation]a ) , and the high amplitude tail of @xmath246 on large angular scales seen before the correction has disappeared .",
    "the shear correlation functions of the simulation are also well - behaved on large angular scales , but have much smaller amplitudes between 10 and @xmath262 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : corre_bins]b ) .",
    "the correction for the @xmath185-@xmath186 dependence is more complicated .",
    "after source coaddition , which depends on the declination of the phase center and the number of times a source was observed , for most sources the @xmath185-@xmath186 shear pattern roughly cancels out , while for others it is enhanced or distorted .",
    "this is potentially a contamination to the lensing signal that is difficult to isolate and correct for .",
    "we nevertheless perform a correction on the @xmath185-@xmath186 plane similar to that for the ha - dec plane . first , we examine the shear pattern on the @xmath185-@xmath186 plane using observed and simulated shears that have been corrected for the ha - dec pattern , fit a low - order polynomial to the plane , and then subtract the fitted pattern from individual measurements .",
    "the sources are grouped according to their size for modeling and corrections , and measurements with averaged residual shear values greater than 1.5% are discarded .",
    "after corrections and coaddition , we again compute the correlation functions for both the data and the simulation .",
    "interestingly , the correlation functions are almost identical to those that have been corrected for ha - dec patterns only ; i.e. , the @xmath185-@xmath186 pattern correction does not alter the correlation functions of the data or of the simulation .",
    "we also checked our corrections by considering subsamples with different source sizes and did not find significant differences in the resulting correlation functions .",
    "we also ran a further series of correlation function tests .",
    "we consider using only sources within @xmath263 of the phase - tracking center where the @xmath185-@xmath186 distortions are small , excluding sources at low declination ( @xmath264 ) where the combined ha - dec and @xmath265 distortions are severe , relaxing or strengthening our imposed constraints on excluding source close companions ( discarding sources within @xmath266 to @xmath267 of one another ) , and changing the range in major axes of the selected sources .",
    "remarkably , the shear correlation functions of the data and of the simulation remain very similar to those of figs .",
    "[ fig : corre_bins]a and [ fig : corre_bins]b , respectively , in every case .",
    "we therefore conclude that the ha - dec corrected shear correlation functions are fairly robust , and that the systematics dependence on the four parameters , ha , dec , @xmath185 and @xmath186 are well - reproduced by the simulations .",
    "we thus take the simulated shear correlation functions after ha - dec corrections , which are non - zero on most scales , as our best estimation for the residual systematics in the ha - dec and @xmath185-@xmath186 parameter space . to correct for these",
    ", we subtract the residual simulated @xmath244 and @xmath245 correlation functions from the corresponding data correlation function .",
    "the errors in each correlation function are then added in quadrature .",

    "the @xmath57 statistics with an aperture radius of @xmath51 is mostly sensitive to angular scales of about @xmath273 .",
    "the depleted e - modes may therefore reflect the presence of systematics on scales smaller than @xmath274 , which roughly corresponds to the scale of the individual fields ( @xmath275 in diameter ) .",

    "2003 ) is also shown in fig .",

    "our results are consistent ( within @xmath9 ) with both of these different measurements . reversing the argument and taking the wmap determination of @xmath6 as a prior",
    ", we find that the median redshift of the radio sources in our sample ( without apm counterpart ) is @xmath306 at 68%cl .",
    "this redshift range is also consistent with the models for the radio source redshift distribution described in  [ zdist ] .",
    "we have presented our cosmic shear measurement using the first radio survey over 8,000 square degrees of sky .",
    "we apply the shear measurement method described in chang & refregier ( 2002 ) to measure shear directly in fourier space , where interferometric data are collected . in this shapelets approach",
    ", we carefully determined the input parameters for the source shape decomposition , and verified that the shear estimators are unbiased and robust using realistic simulations .",
    "the dominant systematic effects associated with interferometric observations were studied in detail .",
    "the analytical and simulated expectations of the systematics compared well with the data when considered functions of four observational parameters .",
    "we corrected the systematics both in this parameter space and in the correlation function domain , and verified the accuracy of the corrections with further simulations .    using the corrected shear correlation functions , we computed the aperture mass statistic , which decomposes the signal into e- and b - modes , containing the lensing signal and the non - lensing contributions , respectively .",
    "we find that the b - modes are consistent with 0 on all scales considered , while the e - modes displays a significant lensing signal .",
    "the e - mode signal has a significance of @xmath307 , as measured at the @xmath281 scale .",
    "the signal increases by 10 - 20% when sources with optical counterparts ( and , therefore , predominantly at low redshift ) are excluded .",
    "this confirms the presence of a lensing signal which is expected to increase as the mean source redshift increases .    using the e - mode @xmath57 statistics on scales @xmath308 ( corresponding to physical scales from about @xmath309 to @xmath310 )",
    ", we constrained jointly the power spectrum normalization @xmath6 and the median redshift @xmath7 of our radio source sample .",
    "we find @xmath8 where the @xmath9 error bars include statistical errors , cosmic variance and systematics . a @xmath18cdm model with @xmath311 and @xmath312 was assumed .",
    "this result is consistent with earlier determinations of @xmath10 from cosmic shear , and with the wmap cmb experiment and cluster abundance tests .",
    "taking the prior on @xmath10 from the wmap experiment , this corresponds to @xmath12 ( 68%cl ) for radio sources without optical counterparts , consistent with existing models for the radio source luminosity function .",
    "our shear measurement is complementary to the earlier cosmic shear results which were all performed in the optical or near - ir band .",
    "it is the first measurement using radio sources observed with interferometers and is therefore subject to very different systematic effects .",
    "we used a new shear measurement method which allows direct computation of shear estimators in fourier space .",
    "moreover , our measurement probes large angular scales , which are in the linear regime of structure growth , eliminating the need for uncertain non - linear corrections in the matter power spectrum .",
    "our measurement thus offers promising prospects for measuring cosmic shear with future radio interferometers such as lofar and ska , which offer exciting opportunities for precision measurements of cosmological parameters ( schneider 1999 ) .",
    "in general , the sensitivity of the image is not exactly constant across the image . here , we compute the effect of the sensitivity variations on the shapes of sources .",
    "we then apply our results to the case of a radial primary beam pattern affecting a circular gaussian source .",
    "let @xmath313 be the intrinsic intensity of a source as a function of position @xmath314 on the image .",
    "the observed intensity is @xmath315 , where @xmath316 is the sensitivity function . in the application below , @xmath316 is simply the primary beam function .",
    "the true centroid @xmath317 of the source is defined by @xmath318 we will assume that the source angular size is small compared to the scale on which @xmath316 varies . by expanding @xmath316 in a taylor series about @xmath317",
    ", it is easy to show that the observed centroid position @xmath319 is , to lowest order , @xmath320 where the summation convention was used and @xmath321 is the normalized quadrupole moment of the source defined as @xmath322 .",
    "we have also defined the normalized derivative tensors of the sensitivity function as @xmath323 we can also compute the observed normalized quadrupole moments of the source @xmath324 about the observed centroid position @xmath325 .",
    "to lowest order , we find @xmath326 where @xmath321,@xmath327 @xmath328 are the true normalized second , third and fourth order moments of the source about @xmath329 .",
    "the terms in @xmath330 arise from the second order derivative of the sensitivity function which distorts the image .",
    "the terms in @xmath331 arise from the shift from the true centroid .",
    "we will now focus on the case of a radial primary beam pattern for which the sensitivity @xmath332 is only a function of the radius @xmath333 from the center of the image . in this case ,",
    "@xmath334 , and @xmath335 , where @xmath336 is the unit radial vector , and @xmath337 and @xmath338 are derivatives of @xmath101 with respect to @xmath333 . for simplicity",
    "we consider a gaussian source of rms radius @xmath339 , such that @xmath340 . in this case , the true moments are simply given by @xmath341 , @xmath342 , and @xmath343 , @xmath344 and @xmath345 . by applying these specific expressions to equation  ( [ eq : jij_sens ] ) , we can find the observed ellipticity @xmath346 and square radius @xmath347 of the source .",
