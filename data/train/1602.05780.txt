    "quantum state estimation ( qse )  the methods , procedures , and algorithms by which one converts tomographic experimental data into an educated guess about the state of the quantum system under investigation @xcite  provides just that : an estimate of the _",
    "state_. for high - dimensional systems , such a state estimate can be hard to come by .",
    "but one is often not even interested in all the details the state conveys and rather cares only about the values of a few functions of the state .",
    "for example , when a source is supposed to emit quantum systems in a specified target state , the fidelity between the actual state and this target could be the one figure of merit we want to know .",
    "then , a direct estimate of the few properties of interest , without first estimating the quantum state , is more practical and more immediately useful .",
    "the full state estimate may not even be available in the first place , if only measurements pertinent to the quantities of interest are made instead of a tomographically complete set , the latter involving a forbidding number of measurement settings in high dimensions .",
    "furthermore , even if we have a good estimate for the quantum state , the values of the few properties of interest computed from this state may not be , and often are not , the best guess for those properties ( see an illustration of this point in sec .",
    "[ sec : scpr ] ) .",
    "therefore , we need to supplement qse with spe  state - property estimation , that is : methods , procedures , and algorithms by which one directly arrives at an educated guess for the few properties of interest .",
    "several schemes have been proposed for determining particular properties of the quantum state .",
    "these are prescriptions for the measurement scheme , and/or estimation procedure from the collected data .",
    "for example , there are schemes for measuring the traces of powers of the statistical operator , and then perform separability tests with the numbers thus found @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could use likelihood ratios for an educated guess whether the state is separable or entangled @xcite .",
    "other schemes are tailored for measuring the fidelity with particular target states @xcite , yet another can be used for estimating the concurrence @xcite .",
    "schemes for measuring other properties of the quantum state can be found by paris s method @xcite .",
    "many of these schemes are property specific , involving sometimes ad - hoc estimation procedures well - suited for only those properties of interest . here , in full analogy to the _ state _ error regions of ref .",
    "@xcite for qse , we describe general - purpose optimal error intervals for spe , from measurement data obtained from generic tomographic measurements or property - specific schemes like those mentioned above . following the maximum - likelihood philosophy for statistical inference , these error intervals give precise `` error bars '' around the maximum - likelihood ( point ) estimator for the properties in question consistent with the data .",
    "according to the bayesian philosophy , they are intervals with a precise probability ( credibility ) of containing the true property values . as is the case for qse error regions , these spe error intervals are optimal in two ways .",
    "first , they have the largest likelihood for the data among all the intervals of the same size .",
    "second , they are smallest among all regions of the same credibility . here",
    ", the natural notion of the size of an interval is its prior content , i.e. , our belief in the interval s importance before any data are taken ; the credibility of an interval is its posterior  after taking the data into account  content .",
    "we will focus on the situation in which a single property of the state is of interest .",
    "this is already sufficient for illustration , but is not a restriction of our methods .",
    "( note : if there are several properties of interest and a consistent set of values is needed , they should be estimated jointly , not one - by - one , to ensure that constraints are correctly taken into account . )",
    "the optimal error interval is a range of values for this property that answers the question : given the observed data , how well do we know the value of the property ?",
    "this question is well answered by the above - mentioned generalization of the maximum - likelihood point estimator to an interval of most - likely values , as well as the dual bayesian picture of intervals of specified credibility .",
    "our error interval is in contrast to other work @xcite based on the frequentists concept of confidence regions / intervals , which answer a different question pertaining to all possible data that could have been observed but is not the right concept for drawing inference from the actual data acquired in a single run ( see appendix [ sec : appcc ] ) .",
    "as we will see below , the concepts and strategies of the optimal error regions for qse @xcite carry over naturally to this spe situation .",
    "however , additional methods are needed for the specific computational tasks of spe .",
    "in particular , there is the technical challenge of computing the property - specific likelihood : in qse , the likelihood for the data as a function over the state space is straightforward to compute ; in spe , the relevant likelihood is the property - specific _ marginal likelihood _ , which requires an integration of the usual ( state ) likelihood over the `` nuisance parameters '' that are not of interest .",
    "this can be difficult to compute even in classical statistics @xcite . here",
    ", we offer an iterative algorithm that allows for reliable estimation of this marginal likelihood .",
    "in addition , we point out the connection between our optimal error intervals and _ plausible intervals _ , an elegant notion of evidence for property values supported by the observed data @xcite .",
    "plausible intervals offer a complementary understanding of our error intervals : plausibility identifies a unique error interval that contains all values for which the data are in favor of , with an associated critical credibility value .",
    "here is a brief outline of the paper .",
    "we set the stage in sec .",
    "[ sec : stage ] where we introduce the reconstruction space and review the notion of size and credibility of a region in the reconstruction space .",
    "analogously , we identify the size and credibility of a range of property values in sec .",

    "then , the flexibility of choosing priors in the property - value space is discussed in sec .",

    "it is worth repeating here that the two types of intervals tell us about very different things : confidence intervals are about statistics on the data ; credible intervals are about statistics on the quantity of interest .",

    "<S> quantum state estimation aims at determining the quantum state from observed data . estimating the full state can require considerable efforts , but one is often only interested in a few properties of the state , such as the fidelity with a target state , or the degree of correlation for a specified bipartite structure . rather than first estimating the state , one can , and should , estimate those quantities of interest directly from the data . </S>",
