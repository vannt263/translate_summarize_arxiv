    "a number of cool core clusters of galaxies host very peculiar diffuse radio sources at their center characterized by a _ core  halo _ ( ch herafter ) structure ( e.g. pks0745191 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these objects show an amorphous steep spectrum halo which surrounds a bright core coincident with the dominant galaxy , with no jets on the kpc scale .",
    "even though the connection between chs and cool core clusters is well established , the origin of these sources remains uncertain .",
    "@xcite argued that they might be produced by the interaction between the radio source and the thermal gas cooling at the cluster center , i.e. in the form of disruption of the jets by the high  pressure ambient medium and buoyant effects on the radio plasma from the disrupted jets . in this letter",
    "we show an interesting spatial correlation between the ch emission and x - ray features in two galaxy clusters 1720   ( @xmath0 ) and 1455   ( @xmath1 ) , both showing a pair of cold fronts ( cf hereafter ) in their core .",
    "we suggest a connection between the origin of the ch structure and the same gas sloshing mechanism responsible for the formation of the cfs .",
    "we use @xmath2  km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "for the purpose of this letter we provide a short summary of the x - ray data preparation and analysis .",
    "we refer to two companion papers for details ( mazzotta et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the analysis of 1720   was performed combining 3 _ chandra _   observations ( obs_id=1453 , 3224 , and 4631 ) . a single _ chandra _   observation ( obs_id=4192 )",
    "was used for ms1455.0 + 2232 .",
    "after flare cleaning , the useful exposure time is @xmath6 and @xmath7 for 1720   and 1455 , respectively .",
    "all images are background subtracted and vignetting corrected .",
    "the spectral analysis was carried out in the 0.79  kev energy band in pi channels .",
    "the spectral fitting was performed assuming fixed absorption and metallicity appropriate for each cluster ( @xmath8  @xmath9 ; @xmath10 , and @xmath11  @xmath9 ; @xmath12 , for 1720   and 1455 , respectively ) .",
    "the temperature maps were produced using a radially increasing gaussian smoothing of @xmath13  pixel in the center up to @xmath14  pixels in the more external regions ( see @xcite for details . )",
    "both 1720   and 1455   were known to host two sharp variations of the surface brightness ( edges ) on opposite side with respect to the cluster center ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it was suggested that such features were cfs but no final conclusion was possible due to the limited statistics available .",
    "the new deeper observations allow us to disentangle the nature of the observed edges . to better highlight the spatial structure of the edges",
    ", we created a ratio image for both clusters by dividing the photon image in the @xmath15 $ ]  kev energy band by its radial mean values simply obtained from the radial profile centered in the x - ray peak .",
    "the resulting image was smoothed using a top  hat function with @xmath16  pixels . the ratio image and",
    "projected temperature map of 1720   are shown in the left and right panels of fig .",

    "[ fig : ratio_rxj1720 ] and [ fig : fig : ratio_ms1455 ] clearly show that the edges appear as part of a more extended spiral  like excess structure at the center of both clusters .",
    "they seem to confine the ch radio emission .",
    "furthermore , the radio structure appears spatially correlated with the x  ray excess , following the spiral pattern in its more external regions .",
    "in this section we demonstrate that all the edges indicated by blue lines in figs .  [",
    "fig : ratio_rxj1720 ] and [ fig : fig : ratio_ms1455 ] are cfs .",

    "using high resolution simulations differet authors showed that cfs in the core of relaxed galaxy clusters may be the result of gas sloshing induced by a minor merger with a small dark matter halo occurred within the last few gyrs ( see e.g @xcite am hereafter and references therein ) .",
    "the only condition for the cf to form is that the cluster has a steep entropy profile ( as observed in cool core clusters ) and the dark matter sub ",
    "halo has a non ",
    "zero impact parameter .",
    "when the sub  halo flies through the main cluster , it produces a gravitational disturbance that pushes the cool gas away from its initial position .",
    "this makes the gas slosh and two or more cfs form on opposite side with respect to the cluster center .",
    "am noticed that , when the gas is displaced from the center for the first time , it does not fall back radially , and the subsequent cf(s ) is ( are ) not exactly concentric but combines into a spiral pattern ( see 1.92.1 gyrs panels in fig .",
    "7 of am ) . as shown in ",
    "[ par : image ] , both the cf pairs in 1720   and 1455 , which are clearly two distinct non concentric structures , seem to combine into a spiral pattern very similarly to what predicted by am .",
    "these structures are remarkably similar to the simulated ones in the surface brightness map ( compare left panels of figs .  [",
    "fig : ratio_rxj1720 ] and [ fig : fig : ratio_ms1455 ] with upper  left panel of fig .",
    "19 of am ) as well as in the temperature map ( compare right panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : ratio_rxj1720 ] and [ fig : fig : ratio_ms1455 ] with lower  left panel of fig .",
    "19 of am ) .",
    "thus the x - ray observations of these two clusters seems to confirm the prediction of am for the gas sloshing .",
    "what appear to be very interesting is that both clusters host a ch radio source .",
    "these sources seem to be well confined ( in projection ) within the cf pairs of the respective cluster .",
    "furthermore , we noticed a spatial correlation between the radio emission and the x - ray spiral structure which might suggest that the radio emitting electrons are trapped into the same icm flows that produced the cfs .",
    "given the lack of jets on the kpc scale , the relativistic electrons need to be transported by some other mechanism from the central galaxy up to the radii of the outermost cfs .",
    "we might speculate that the relativistic electrons injected by the central agn , and trapped into the icm magnetic field , are transported at the cfs radii by the motion of the low entropy thermal gas induced by the gas sloshing .",
    "in fact , the am simulations show that the cfs are formed by the continuous circulation of lower entropy gas that comes from the inner core region and falls back soon after ( see fig  7 of am ) .",
    "however , am show that the speed of this gas circulation is relatively low with an upper limit of @xmath44 . in both clusters",
    "the outermost cf is at a radial distance of @xmath45 . assuming radial transport",
    ", we estimate that the minimum time needed for the relativistic electrons to be displaced up to the position of the outermost front is @xmath46 .",
    "this time is much larger than the radiative lifetime of relativistic electrons which suffer energy losses mainly due to inverse compton with the cosmic microwave background photons ( @xmath47 ; see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this simple calculation suggests that the observed radio emission might be produced by re  acceleration of a population of relic electrons , injected into the icm by a previous activity of the central agn . due to the subsonic nature of the gas sloshing",
    ", we can exclude that the re  acceleration may be driven by thermal shock .",
    "an alternative and plausible mechanisms may be the re  acceleration by mhd turbulence , as suggested to explain the cluster mini  halos ( ) and giant radio halos ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these authors claim that , to be effective , this re  acceleration mechanism requires only a modest level ( few per cent ) of turbulence .",
    "in fact , 2d simulations with much higher resolutions have shown that the gas sloshing could automatically create turbulence in a core ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the ch / cfs correlation described in this letter is not limited to these two clusters but seems to be present also in other clusters hosting a ch , as e.g. 2a0335 + 096 ( @xcite ) , pks0745191 ( @xcite ) , and a2052 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these results calls for further and deeper investigation of the radio  x - ray connection in relaxed clusters with cfs , which will be addressed in forthcoming papers .",
