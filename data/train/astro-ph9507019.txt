    "cosmological overdensities on supercluster scales are pancake - like ; nevertheless , galaxy clusters can not be considered as planar structures ; clusters are similar to ellipsoids , which become quasispherical in some cases ( coma cluster ) .",
    "this shape suggests the use of spherical symmetry as an approximating condition .",
    "this symmetry strongly reduces the computational cost with respect to the general tridimensional ( 3d ) case , but the resulting evolution is too fast .",
    "this problem with the evolution of spherical clusters is a result of the radial structure of the velocity field . even for vanishing initial velocities ,",
    "gravitational forces generate a too rapid infalling radial motion .",
    "as it is proved in section 4 , the fast evolution of the spherical model leads to an overestimate of the nonlinear anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) produced by galaxy clusters .",
    "even for very accurate spherical models ( including hot gas ) , the nonlinear anisotropy is always overestimated .    in the last decade",
    ", there has been a lot of work on the cmb anisotropies produced by nonlinear cosmological structures .",
    "nearby voids , clusters and great attractor - like objects have been considered .",
    "these structures are often modeled by using spherically symmetric pressureless solutions of the einstein equations .",
    "two popular models are based on this kind of solutions : ( i ) the swiss - cheese ( sc ) model proposed by rees & sciama ( 1968 ) is based on a matching of three exact solutions .",
    "this model involves rather particular initial conditions , and ( ii ) the tolman - bondi ( tb ) model is based on the solution obtained by tolman ( 1934 ) and bondi ( 1947 ) ; in this second case , initial conditions are general .",
    "the initial profiles of the energy density and the velocity can be arbitrarily chosen ( arnau et al . 1993 ) .",
    "chodorowski ( 1991 ) used a newtonian version of the tb model .",
    "this version applies when relativistic effects are negligible and , consequently , it applies in the case of nonlinear galaxy clusters .",
    "nottale ( 1984 ) used the sc model to predict relative temperature variations @xmath2 for very dense and fast collapsing objects , but the masses of these objects are much greater than that of the richest cluster . in the case of feasible rich clusters ,",
    "recent estimates based on the tb model and its newtonian version are presented in table 1 , where d is the distance from the observer to the cluster and @xmath3 is the mass inside a sphere of radius @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting predictions depend on the amplitudes ( normalization ) and the shapes of the initial profiles . from table 1",
    ", it follows that the predicted @xmath5 values corresponding to realistic rich clusters are a few times @xmath6 .",
    "these values are below presently observable levels . the main limitations of the sc and the tb models are the spherical symmetry condition and the absence of pressure .    in the case of very large structures , such as voids and great attractor - like objects",
    ", the spherical pressureless model seems to be acceptable , but in the case of clusters , the combined effect of high density contrasts and radial infalling velocities lead to an unavoidable collapse ( see below ) ; furthermore , the hot gas content in clusters is around @xmath7 and may even reach up to @xmath8 of the estimated virial mass ( bhringer & wiedenmann 1991 ) ; hence , the hot gas component is not clearly negligible .",
    "the pressure of this component could produce very large gradients even shocks which could be comparable to the gradients of the dominant dark component . since the nonlinear anisotropy produced by a cluster essentially depends on time variations of the spatial gradients of the total gravitational potential , the contribution of the hot gas component should not be neglected without any justification .",
    "this component should be gravitationally coupled to the pressureless matter in order to estimate its importance in the calculation of anisotropies .",
    "a spherically symmetric coupling is studied in this paper .",
    "some conclusions can be extended to the general nonsymmetric case .    in a previous paper ( quilis , ibez & sez 1994 ) , it was shown that some shocks develop in the hot gas component of simplified planar 1d structures , the same could occur in the spherically symmetric case .",
    "the possible formation of shocks strongly motivates the use of modern _ high - resolution shock - capturing _ techniques ; nevertheless , the use of these techniques is preferable in any case , even in the absence of shocks . some advantages of these codes are described by ryu et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .",
    "other estimates of the cmb anisotropy produced by clusters are based on n - body simulations .",
    "van kampen & martnez - gonzlez ( 1991 ) simulated a rich cluster producing an effect on the order of a few times @xmath0 .",
    "anninos et al .",
    "( 1991 ) considered a distribution of nonlinear objects but they did not study the effect produced by a single rich cluster .",
    "the main problems with n - body simulations are : the absence of a hot gas component and the uncertainties in both the spectrum and the statistics of the energy density distribution . a lot of information about clusters",
    "is concerned with the temperature , the density contrast and the energy radiated by the hot gas component , but these quantities are not considered in n - body simulations .",
    "this information should be compared with theoretical predictions given by a suitable model based on the 3d coupling between the hot gas ( described by modern _ high - resolution shock - capturing _ techniques ) and the pressureless ( described by _",
    "n - body simulations _ ) component .",
    "this model is complicated .",
    "the comparison between its predictions and the observations ( including those related to the hot gas component ) should be very important in order to simultaneously test the spectrum , the statistics , and all the usual hypothesis about the composition and properties of the hot gas component .    in this paper , the possible production of shocks and the importance of the hot gas component",
    "are studied in the framework of the spherically symmetric model .",
    "some conclusions can be extrapolated to the general 3d case .",
    "the anisotropy produced by a distribution of nonlinear density perturbations is being currently studied ; recently , martnez - gonzlez , sanz & silk ( 1994 ) have reported that these nonlinear anisotropies range from @xmath6 to @xmath9 on degree angular scales .",
    "the main problems with this kind of calculations arise as a result of the current uncertainties about the time evolution of both the spectrum and the statistics of the nonlinear density distribution .",
    "given a null geodesic , any nonlinear object located near this line influences the corresponding microwave photon ; hence , taking into account the existence of nonlinear structures from the observer position to distances of order @xmath10 the beginning of nonlinearity , estimates of the total nonlinear anisotropy would require : ( 1 ) n - body simulations in very large boxes including the observer and all the structures influencing the cmb and ( 2 ) information about the time evolution of a nonlinear spectrum involving all the nonlinear scales .",
    "since such a spectrum and simulations are not yet available ( even if the hot gas component is neglected ) , other approaches giving useful _ indications _ about the anisotropy produced by a realistic distribution of nonlinear structures are very useful .",
    "one of these approaches is the estimate of the anisotropy produced by a single nonlinear cluster .    here , the spherical freely falling model for cluster evolution",
    "is improved by introducing a hot gas component .",
    "the limitations of this model are pointed out and some applications to the estimation of cmb anisotropies are presented and discussed ; furthermore , another spherical model ( section 4.2 ) is used in order to find significant upper limits to the anisotropies produced by nearby virialized clusters .",
    "the main features of our improved spherical model are : ( i ) the clusters are assumed to be nonlinear structures formed by a pressureless component cold dark matter plus point - like galaxies and a hot rarified gas emitting in the x  band , ( ii ) both components evolve in the total gravitational field created by themselves , and ( iii ) modern _ high - resolution shock - capturing _ techniques are used in order to solve the partial differential equations governing the evolution of the system .",

    "relevant upper limits to the nonlinear anisotropies produced by galaxy clusters are shown in section 4 .",
    "a discussion about the evolution of the hot gas component is presented in section 5 , and the main conclusions are summarized and discussed in section 6 .",
    "our model consists of a hot baryonic fluid and a pressureless one , both fluids are gravitationally coupled . the hot component is described as a fluid with pressure , while the dark matter and the point - like galaxies are two components of an unique pressureless fluid .",

    "these conditions make unnecessary a relativistic approach . in all our applications",

    "a geometric spatial grid with 400 cells is used .",
    "it has been verified that a grid with 800 cells does not lead to physically significant differences with respect to the 400 cells grid .",
    "hence , this number of cells warranties the convergence to the solution .",
    "our hydro - code passed successfully the standard shock tube tests , both in the newtonian and relativistic 1d cases ( mart , ibez & miralles 1990 , 1991 ; marquina et al .",
    "pure cosmological tests were presented in quilis , ibez & sez ( 1993 , 1994 ) .",
    "in this section , the initial conditions for cluster evolution are fixed in such a way that the resulting cluster appears to be similar to the observed ones ; however , the evolution of these structures is not realistic .",
    "a very rich abell cluster is simulated from a particular choice of the initial conditions .",
    "radio observations at @xmath69 show that the level of neutral hydrogen located inside clusters is very low ( gunn - peterson test ) . in the framework of a cold dark matter model ( cen & ostriker 1992 )",
    ", the high degree of ionization of the hot baryonic gas can not be produced by shocks , bremsstrahlung or free - bound radiation ; hence , this ionization must be assumed to be an initial condition .",
    "the high amount of iron in the hot gas requires that a large fraction of this comes from galaxies in bursts and winds ( see bhringer & wiedenmann 1991 and references cited therein ) . on account of these considerations ,",
    "the hot gas is assumed to be mainly formed by high energetic particles produced by stellar evolution winds , supernovae and by processes in active galactic nuclei .",
    "this part of the gas and the residual primordial gas ( which is not confined inside galaxies during galaxy formation ) are strongly ionized by ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars , the resulting gas remains ionized until present time .",
    "it is also assumed that the formation of the ionized gas and its localization in the intergalactic space occurs during a cosmologically short period ; thus , this gas is assumed to be instantaneously formed at a given initial redshift @xmath70 ( the feasibility of this assumption is discussed in section .",
    "it is assumed that galaxies trace mass ; thus , the initial density of galaxies is proportional to that of dark matter . since galaxies were formed in the primordial baryonic gas and they afterwards produced the main part of the ionized component observed in clusters , the initial density of this component is assumed to be proportional to that of galaxies ; hence , all the initial densities are assumed to be proportional to the total energy density .",
    "density contrasts are accordingly related among them .",
    "initial velocities are assumed to be identical for the three components .",
    "the dark matter and the point - like galaxies are pressureless components obeying the same equations ; hence , their velocities are identical at any time . as a result of the absence of pressure",
    ", these velocities can be obtained by using the spherical freely falling solution of the newtonian hydrodynamics equations ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "this solution admits an arbitrary density contrast .",
    "the chosen velocities correspond to vanishing decaying modes .",
    "finally , since the hot gas is mainly formed inside galaxies ( and galaxies are formed in the initial primordial gas ) , all the hot gas component participates at the beginning of the same motions as the point - like galaxies ; during evolution , the hot gas and the pressureless component evolve in a different way and , consequently , their velocity fields become different .",
    "the initial profile of the total density contrast is chosen to be : _ _ t(r , t_i)=  , where @xmath71 is the amplitude of @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the radial distance at which the initial density contrast reduces to one - half of its amplitude @xmath71 .",
    "this profile gives suitable present profiles for galaxies .",
    "there is a set of free parameters in the initial conditions",
    ". the values of these parameters must be chosen in such a way that the simulated and the observed clusters be comparable .",
    "the free parameters are : the initial redshift @xmath74 , @xmath71 , @xmath73 , the initial specific internal energy @xmath75 , and the ratio between the amplitudes of the hot gas and the total energy densities .",
    "as the observations in the x - band and the observations of the sunyaev -zeldovich ( 1980 ) effect suggest , the hot gas component is very rarified .",
    "this gas is mainly formed by protons , electrons , and helium nuclei .",
    "it is highly ionized .",
    "the abundance of protons and he nuclei are assumed to be of 9 to 1 in number .",
    "the resulting gas is treated as a monoatomic gas ( adiabatic coefficient @xmath76 ) with an averaged atomic weight calculated from the above standard abundances ( sherman 1982 ) .",
    "the temperature evolution of the rarified hot gas is only sensitive to the compton cooling and the thermal bremsstrahlung . as a result of the small density of neutral elements , other interactions like recombinations and ionizations",
    "are not important ; hence , the term @xmath77 involved in some equations of section 2.2 can be written as follows : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the contributions of the compton cooling and the thermal bremsstrahlung , respectively .",
    "according to umemura & ikeuchi ( 1984 ) @xmath79 and @xmath80 are : ^c=5.410 ^ -36(1+z)^4 n_e t ( erg cm^-3 s^-1 ) and ^br=1.810 ^ -27n_et^12(n__hii + 4n__heiii ) ( erg cm^-3 s^-1 ) where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the number density of electrons , protons , and helium nuclei , respectively .",
    "the main observational features of galaxy clusters are the following : the density of electrons in units of @xmath84 ranges in the interval ( @xmath85 ) ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1980 ) and the total mass within a radius of @xmath86 is @xmath87 .",
    "these data are only compatible with @xmath88 values ranging in the interval ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the radius of the core is @xmath90 , @xmath91 being the distance at which the present energy density reduces to one - half of its maximum value ( peebles 1994 ) .",
    "the temperature of the hot gas component , @xmath26 , and the luminosity , @xmath28 , in units of @xmath92 range in the intervals ( @xmath93 ) and ( @xmath94 ) , respectively ( bhringer 1991 ) .",
    "the present density contrast of the galaxy distribution has the form ( 12 ) .    for the following initial conditions : @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 ,",
    "table 2 shows the features of the resulting structure at the times @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .    at time @xmath101",
    ", the resulting structure looks like a very rich abell cluster ( perhaps a too rich cluster , but see below for a justification of this choice ) ; hence , our spherically symmetric model can reproduce the main features of realistic clusters ; nevertheless , the evolution of the chosen cluster is not admissible . at time @xmath102 , the densities , the luminosity , and the temperature are too great , while the size is too small ; hence , an unavoidable collapse is developing . at times smaller than @xmath100 , the densities and the temperature become too small and the size becomes too large .",
    "the existence of rather stable clusters located between @xmath103 to @xmath104 is not compatible with the spherical symmetry condition .",
    "this occurs because the pressureless component has a radial infalling motion accelerated by gravity and , consequently , this component fast collapses , forcing the collapse of the subdominant hot gas component , and making the clusters very unstable structures .",
    "as it is proved in the next section , any quickly evolving spherical model ( including the model of this paper plus the sc and tb models ) leads to overestimates of the anisotropies produced by clusters . in spite of these facts ,",
    "the spherical model can be appropriately used in order to get significant upper limits for the nonlinear anisotropy .",
    "figure 1 shows the profiles of the hot gas and the pressureless density contrasts at time @xmath101 .",
    "no shocks have appeared in the hot gas component .",
    "although this component is gravitationally dragged by the rapid freely falling pressureless component , pressure has not produced spatial gradients larger than those of the pressureless fluid ; hence , the presence of pressure does not seem to be important in order to compute cluster anisotropies ( see section 4.1 for a quantitative verification of this statement ) .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the study of the hot gas component should be important in order to study the evolution and normalization of 3d realistic clusters , but it does not seem to be directly relevant in the calculation of nonlinear anisotropies . since the largest gradients and the shocks are expected to be favored by the rapid infalling induced by the spherical symmetry condition , the above conclusion about the importance of the hot gas component in the calculation of nonlinear anisotropies can be extended to the case of realistic clusters .",
    "this important fact justifies the computations of nonlinear anisotropies based on n - body simulations ( excluding the hot baryonic gas ) .",
    "the evolved profile of the pressureless density contrast has the form ( 12 ) , hence , the predicted profile of point - like galaxies is compatible with observations .",
    "since shock formation is expected to be more feasible in the case of the richest clusters , we have preferred the study of a very rich one ( perhaps too rich ) ; thus the absence of shocks in the chosen case ensures the absence of these phenomena in the case of any realistic rich cluster .",
    "objects similar to abell clusters can be simulated at any time by using our freely falling model .",
    "admissible times would range from @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "the evolution appears to be wrong in any case .",
    "any overdensity located between the observer and his last scattering surface produces : ( 1 ) a sachs - wolfe effect , ( 2 ) a doppler effect , which appears as a result of the peculiar velocity produced by the overdensity on the last scattering , ( 3 ) a second doppler effect due to the peculiar velocity induced on the observer , ( 4 ) a sunyaev - zeldovich effect produced by the interaction between the cmb photons and the free electrons of the overdensity , and ( 5 ) a gravitational nonlinear effect .    in the case of a nonlinear cluster , the effects ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are negligible because these structures are very far from the last scattering surface .",
    "the effect ( 3 ) is only relevant when the cluster is located very near to the observer ( virgo cluster ) , it has an exactly dipolar form . the effect ( 4 )",
    "is the dominant one in the case of a single object , its estimate is easy and its detection has been claimed by uson & wilkinson ( 1988 ) and birkinshaw ( 1990 ) . the total sunyaev - zeldovich effect produced by a realistic distribution of clusters is a matter of current study .",
    "the study of the effect ( 5 ) is the main subject of this section .",

    "the integral involving the spatial gradients of the potential @xmath105 is the most appropriated in order to be evaluated by using our numerical methods .",
    "these gradients are directly involved in the differential equations describing the cluster evolution ; hence , when these equations are numerically solved , the spatial gradients are directly calculated at the nodes of the spatial grid and at each time step ; afterwards , the gradients can be calculated at arbitrary positions and times by using suitable interpolations .",

    "( 15 ) must be carried out along each null geodesic from the emitter ( e ) to the observer ( o ) .",

    "if the spherical cluster simulated in section 3 is located at @xmath108 from the observer , the resulting amplitude of the nonlinear anisotropy is @xmath109 ( see fig .",

    "these data facilitate comparisons with the predictions of table 1 .",
    "let us discuss in detail some of these comparisons .",
    "we begin with panek s predictions ( 1992 ) . in the model described in the second row of table 1",
    ", there is a total mass @xmath115 inside a sphere of radius @xmath116 , this mass is very similar to that of the cluster considered in this section ; however , the amplitude of the density contrast corresponding to our cluster ( see table 2 ) is much greater than that of panek s model ( @xmath117 ) ; as a result of this discrepancy , the amplitude of the anisotropy obtained by panek ( 1992 ) is one - half of our amplitude .",
    "let now consider chodorowski s estimates ( 1991 ) . in the cases presented in the rows 3 and 4 of table 1 , the masses located inside spheres of radius @xmath118 are smaller than the mass corresponding to our model ( @xmath113 ) and , consequently",
    ", our results can not be directly compared with those of table 1 ; nevertheless , an indirect comparison can be established taking into account that the amplitude of the anisotropy computed by chodorowski ( 1991 ) scales with the mass like @xmath119 ( see nottale 1984 ) , this fact can be easily verified from the data exhibited in the rows 3 and 4 of table 1 .",
    "the mentioned scaling leads to the conclusion that , in chodorowski s models ( 1991 ) , the amplitude of the anisotropy coresponding to @xmath120 is @xmath121 ; this value is in very good agreement with our estimate .",
    "after these comparisons , we can conclude that our prediction seems to be compatible with those of chodorowski ( 1991 ) and panek ( 1992 ) .",
    "the differences between our amplitude and those of the above authors appear as a result of the differences in the normalization and slope of the density and velocity profiles .",
    "our normalization takes into account the features of the hot gas component ( see section 3 ) .",
    "previous amplitudes and the amplitude computed in this section have been overestimated ( as the @xmath105 evolution ) .",
    "they are upper limits .",
    "the spatial gradients of the peculiar gravitational potentials produced by the hot gas and the dark matter components have been separately calculated .",
    "these gradients have been used in order to compute the anisotropy produced by each of these components according to eq ( 15 ) . in fig .",
    "2 , the total temperature contrast @xmath5 and the part of this contrast produced by the pressureless matter are shown . the difference ( @xmath122 of the total effect )",
    "is produced by the hot gas component . since",
    "the @xmath123 of the total mass is contained in the hot gas and this gas produces the @xmath122 of the total anisotropy , the contribution of the hot baryonic component to @xmath5 is very similar to the expected contribution ( @xmath124 ) corresponding to the same proportion of pressureless matter ; hence , the effect of the pressure is not important .",
    "this conclusion is in good agreement with the absence of shocks and large gradients in the density profile corresponding to the hot gas ( see fig .",
    "1 )      in order to obtain more stringent upper limits to the nonlinear anisotropy produced by clusters , it must be taken into account that : ( a ) any overestimate of the time evolution of the gravitational potential @xmath105 leads to an upper limit for @xmath5 , and ( b ) the smaller the differences between the true evolution and the overestimated one , the smaller and more stringent the resulting upper limit .",
    "after virialization , the upper limits of section 4.1 are not stringent enough because they are based on too great overestimates of @xmath125 ; stringent limits corresponding to this period are obtained in this section .    in realistic clusters , the particles ( point - like galaxies and small gravitationally bounded amounts of cold dark matter )",
    "do not move radially ; after the process of violent relaxation ( lynden - bell 1967 ) , these particles reach quasistable orbits in the total gravitational field of the structure and the inertial forces almost compensate the gravitational ones ; thus the fall towards the centre becomes very slow and the clusters appear to be highly stable structures undergoing modest changes .",
    "the shape of the system can be quasispherical .",
    "after violent relaxation , the total density contrast , @xmath37 , of the resulting cluster has been estimated to be @xmath126 ( bhringer and wiedenmann 1991 ) ; hence , according to our definition of the contrasts ( see section 2 ) , in a model containing @xmath123 of baryonic hot gas , the corresponding @xmath88 value is @xmath127 .",
    "these estimates are based on a very simple spherical homogeneous model . in more realistic models based on nonuniform density profiles ( see fig .",
    "1 and eq . 12 ) , the distribution of mass is not homogeneous and the expected amplitudes of @xmath37 and @xmath88 should reach values greater than those predicted by the homogeneous model . on account of these facts , it is hereafter assumed that , after virialization , the amplitude of @xmath88 is @xmath128 .",
    "this conservative assumption is also compatible with the limits on @xmath88 discussed in section 3 , which are based on observations .",
    "as discussed in bhringer and wiedenmann ( 1991 ) , all the clusters do not virialize at the same redshift ; according to these authors , the virialization finishes at a certain time depending on the initial conditions defining the protocluster in the linear regime .",
    "a conservative hypothesis compatible with observations and theoretical considerations is that any cluster undergoes virialization at a redshift @xmath129 .    during the violent relaxation ,",
    "the gravitational field undergoes rapid variations and , consequently , the upper limits based on the spherically symmetric model of section 3 are much better than in the subsequent slowly evolving period .",
    "after violent relaxation , the situation is very different ; the evolution is not known , but two possibilities can be imagined : ( a ) the cluster tends to a stationary state and , ( b ) the cluster tends to collapse but at a rate which is much slower than during the relaxation . in case ( a ) , the evolution of virialized clusters at @xmath130 would be very slow . in case",
    "( b ) , these clusters would evolve faster than in case ( a ) as a result of the progressive instability of the system . in order to find upper limits for the anisotropy produced by virialized clusters at @xmath130 , a certain evolution of kind ( b ) is appropriately simulated .    according to the observations , all the galaxy clusters from @xmath103 to @xmath104 have a hot baryonic component with density contrast @xmath88 ranging from @xmath131 to @xmath132 ; hence , the fastest admissible evolution of kind ( b ) would produce a present cluster with @xmath133 starting from the value @xmath134 corresponding to @xmath135 ( see above ) .",
    "any quantity being bounded by the observations as the total mass inside a sphere of @xmath86 can be used to define overestimated evolutions in the same way as @xmath88 .",
    "any overestimated evolution is fictitious . it does not describe the true evolution of the clusters .",
    "it is only used with the essential aim of finding upper limits to the nonlinear anisotropy .",
    "this kind of evolution can be produced by fictitious suitable forces .",
    "the use of fictitious forces is not a newness in cosmology , they are introduced in the _ adhesion model _",
    "( gurvatov , saichev & shandarin 1989 ) with the essential aim of simulating structure formation ; nevertheless , in our case , the role of the fictitious forces is more modest than in the adhesion case .",
    "an evolution of kind ( b ) can be simulated by means of a fictitious force producing a partial cancelation of the gravitational one .",
    "a perfect cancelation leads to stationarity .",
    "the strongest the cancelation , the slowest the evolution .",
    "if the fictitious force @xmath136 is assumed to be proportional to the gravitational one ( @xmath137 , @xmath138 ) , the inner regions becomes more stable than the outer ones , where gravitational forces are greater ; thus , some kind of accretion on the core is simulated .",
    "this core is not fully stable because the gravitational force increases as a result of the accretion , but the instability does not produce a too rapid collapse as in the absence of any compensating action . the residual force leads to a certain degree of evolution .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath139 can be numerically determined in each case by assuming a final @xmath88 value of order @xmath132 ; thus a too fast evolution is simulated ( at least for @xmath130 ) .",
    "@xmath140 corresponds to stationarity .    in practice ,",
    "the computations are carried out as follows : ( 1 ) the model described in section 3 is used in order to obtain suitable density contrasts ( @xmath134 ) at @xmath141 .",
    "these contrasts plus vanishing velocities are the initial conditions for the subsequent evolution , in which , the pressure is neglected and a fictitious antigravity force is introduced .",
    "these conditions are easily included in the codes described in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath139 is fitted in order to get suitable overestimates of the evolution ; namely , suitable final values @xmath133 .",
    "the case described in fig .",
    "3 corresponds to a cluster with contrasts @xmath142 and @xmath143 at redshifts @xmath144 and @xmath145 , respectively . at the small redshifts corresponding to the assumed locations of the cluster ( @xmath146 ) , @xmath88 is greater than @xmath132 .",
    "a parameter @xmath147 has been necessary in order to simulate this evolution .",
    "this quantity gives a qualitative idea about the high degree of stability being necessary in order to explain the observations about clusters .",
    "since the gravitational forces are very strong , the main part of them must be cancelled in order to keep acceptable levels of accretion ( variations of @xmath105 ) .",
    "the simulated object has a total mass @xmath148 inside a radius of @xmath86 .",
    "it is a rich cluster .",
    "3 shows the nonlinear anisotropy for three positions of the system . in these positions , the distances from the cluster centre to the observer",
    "are @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 .",
    "the amplitude of the nonlinear anisotropy is @xmath152 in all the cases , but the angular scales consistently change .",
    "the results displayed in fig . 3 have been obtained in the case @xmath153 .",
    "this high value of @xmath135 has been arbitrarily chosen .",
    "values of @xmath135 smaller than 1 have been also considered , but the results corresponding to these values are not displayed in figures by the sake of briefness .",
    "these results lead to the following conclusion : if a rich cluster is normalized in the same way as in the case @xmath154 and located at @xmath155 , the resulting anisotropy is @xmath152 for any admissible choice of @xmath156 .",
    "this anisotropy is very similar to that predicted by van kampen and martnez - gonzlez by using n - body simulations .",
    "since @xmath88 increases from @xmath131 to @xmath157 in all the cases , the fictitious evolution corresponding to @xmath154 is slower than that of the cases @xmath156 and , consequently , the resulting anisotropy should be an increasing function of @xmath135 ; since this dependence on @xmath135 is not found , the fictitious evolution although faster than the true evolution should be negligible in all the cases . in order to verify this possibility ,",
    "the gravitational force has been completely canceled ( @xmath140 ) and the anisotropy has been calculated again ; as expected , the results are indistinguishable from those presented in fig .",
    "3 . two main conclusion can be obtained : ( 1 ) at @xmath130 , any admissible evolution is too slow to produce a significant contribution to @xmath5 and ( 2 ) the resulting @xmath5 values obtained in our computations are produced by a non - evolving spherical cluster located at various positions . the time delay of the cmb photons crossing a nonlinear stationary structure produces the estimated anisotropy .",
    "this effect was first described by rees an sciama ( 1968 ) .    from the above results ,",
    "the following conservative conclusion can be obtained : any rich cluster produces an effect of a few times @xmath0 at @xmath130 .",
    "the angular scale of this anisotropy depends on the position of the cluster ( see fig . 3 for the angular scales corresponding to three locations ) .",
    "any realistic distribution of virialized clusters can not produce relevant effects ranging in the interval @xmath158 .",
    "nearby clusters located at distances smaller than @xmath151 ( @xmath146 ) can only produce relevant anisotropies if they are undergoing violent relaxation .",
    "taking into account that the distances between clusters are of various tens of megaparsecs , this kind of nearby objects can only appear in some isolated directions .",
    "the effect of these clusters could be separately considered after detection in observational surveys ; hence , we are hereafter concerned with non virialized clusters located at @xmath159 , which would produce anisotropies on scales smaller than @xmath160 .",
    "are these anisotropies cosmologically relevant ? .",
    "some comments about this question are worthwhile .    during the epoch of violent relaxation ,",
    "cluster evolution is faster than in the subsequent epoch ; hence , the most important anisotropies must be produced during relaxation . in this epoch ,",
    "the upper limits given by the freely infalling model of section 3 are much more stringent than at @xmath161 .",
    "these limits can be obtained in the same way as in section 4.1 , but the epoch of infalling and the location of the cluster must be appropriately fixed near @xmath135 .",
    "the resulting upper limits are of the same order as in section 4.1 ; therefore , the anisotropies arising during relaxation could reach values near @xmath9 for the richest clusters .",
    "if a cluster is located at @xmath103 , the angular scale of the corresponding anisotropy is about @xmath162 , while the angular scale corresponding to @xmath163 is @xmath160 ; hence , the total anisotropy produced by clusters undergoing violent relaxation at different redshifts @xmath164 is a superposition of angular scales ranging from @xmath162 to @xmath165 . according to this discussion ,",
    "we claim that the main part of the nonlinear effect ( 5 ) should be produced during a brief period ( @xmath166 ) corresponding to violent relaxation of clusters ; in other words , only the clusters located in a narrow interval of redshifts would produce significant anisotropies and each of these cluster would only produce anisotropy during the short period of violent relaxation .",
    "these facts could guide and simplify future estimates based on n - body simulations .",
    "the anisotropy produced by a distribution of clusters can not be calculated from that of a single cluster , but amplitudes at the level of @xmath9 or @xmath6 ( see martnez - gonzlez , sanz & silk 1994 ) , on angular scales between @xmath162 and @xmath165 are suggested by the above arguments . more work is necessary in order to see if the currently observable level ( @xmath167 ) is reached .",
    "if the pressure of the hot gas component is not neglected from @xmath135 to @xmath145 in order to obtain temperatures and luminosities , and the compensating antigravity force is introduced in order to stabilize the system , the above conclusions about anisotropies do not change ; however , it has been verified that the compton cooling and the thermal bremsstrahlung strongly cool the system .",
    "starting from initial admissible values of the temperatures and luminosities , the evolved values become too low .",
    "the clusters are radiating energy during a long period from @xmath135 to the redshift defining the cluster location and , consequently , a too strong cooling is produced .",
    "this effect decreases as @xmath135 decreases .",
    "the same effect is expected in realistic nonsymmetric cases ( although the stabilization is not produced by fictitious forces ) .",
    "this problem is a result of the hypothesis that all the hot gas component was generated and distributed at a certain initial redshift ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the hot gas component must be continuously ejected from galaxies and a substantial part of this component must arrive to the intracluster medium after @xmath135 .",
    "this is a necessary ingredient of future nonsymmetric simulations .",
    "cluster evolution has been proved to be slower than the evolution predicted by spherical models ; on account of this fact , these models can only be used in order to obtain upper limits to the anisotropy produced by galaxy clusters .",
    "the cs and tb models lead to very fast evolutions , which only give stringent enough upper limits to @xmath5 during the brief period of violent relaxation .",
    "nottale ( 1984 ) , chodorowski ( 1991 ) , panek ( 1992 ) and sez , arnau & fullana ( 1993 ) presented some estimates based on these models ( see table 1 ) .",
    "appropriate spherical models evolving faster than the observed clusters are used in order to obtain upper limits to the microwave background anisotropies produced by some clusters . in the case of a virialized nearby clusters ( @xmath168 ) ,",
    "the angular scale of the anisotropy is larger than @xmath165 and its amplitude is a few times @xmath0 . the anisotropy produced by a realistic distribution of these structures is too small to be detected .",
    "nonlinear clusters undergoing virialization in the period @xmath168 can not be very abundant , these objects can be only observed in isolated directions ( see section 4.2 ) , they lead to small local spots with amplitudes of a few times @xmath169 ( perhaps near @xmath9 for very rich clusters ) . only clusters undergoing violent relaxation at redshifts @xmath166 can produce significant anisotropies on large regions .",
    "the total effect of all these clusters is a superposition of anisotropies on angular scales ranging from @xmath160 to @xmath170 .",
    "upper limits based on the spherical freely infalling model prove that this anisotropy is smaller than @xmath9 ( likely a few times @xmath6 ) .",
    "realistic cluster models are necessary in order to improve these conclusions .    in order to simulate realistic clusters",
    ", it would be desirable a suitable coupling between a 3d code based on modern _ high - resolution shock - capturing _ techniques and a n - body code .",
    "the first code would describe the evolution of the hot gas component and the second one would describe the pressureless matter . both components must evolve in their total gravitational field . here , it has been verified that the hot gas component must be gradually generated . in our opinion ,",
    "the most interesting feature of these realistic models is the study of the temperature and the luminosity of the hot baryonic component , whose evolution for given cosmological spectra and ( or ) statistics can be compatible ( or not ) with observational data . furthermore , these future models could be basic in order to estimate the sunyaev - zeldovich effect produced by the hot gas located inside clusters .",
    "fortunately , according to our estimates , neglecting the hot gas component ( n - body simulations ) must lead to an accurate enough computation of the nonlinear gravitational anisotropy produced by clusters ; of course , a model including this component would give more accurate estimates of these anisotropies .    _",
