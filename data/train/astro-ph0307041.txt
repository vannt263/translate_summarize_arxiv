    "most of the neutron star low  mass x  ray binaries can be divided into two classes , z and atoll sources , based on the correlated behavior of their timing properties at low frequencies ( @xmath0 hz ) and their x  ray spectral properties @xcite .",
    "both classes show quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) with frequencies ranging from a few hundred hz to more than 1000 hz ( kilohertz qpos ) . the low ",
    "frequency part of the power spectra of both classes is usually dominated by a similar broad band  limited noise component , but it is unclear if these are physically the same component @xcite .",
    "in addition to the band  limited noise both classes show several quasi - periodic oscillations below 200 hz . in the z sources these are named after the branch of the z track in the color  color diagram ( see below ) where they mostly occur : horizontal ( hbos ) , normal ( nbos ) and flaring branch oscillations ( fbos ) .",
    "the hbo shows a sub and a second harmonic at @xmath1 and @xmath2 times the frequency of the main peak , and sometimes a peak at @xmath3 times the frequency of the hbo @xcite . obviously , the most straightforward interpretation of this is that the sub hbo is the fundamental frequency , with second , third and fourth harmonics all observed @xcite .",
    "below 200 hz the atoll sources show several lorentzian components ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "note that these components are called lorentzian and not qpo ; this is because these features are sometimes too broad ( fwhm @xmath4 centroid frequency/2 ) to be classified as a qpo . in the atoll sources all components",
    "become broader as their characteristic frequency decreases @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the hbo in the z and the low  frequency lorentzian in the atoll sources are the same physical components @xcite .    the energy spectrum of neutron star low  mass x ",
    "ray binaries can be usefully parametrized through the use of color  color or color  intensity diagrams , where a color is the ratio of counts in two different energy bands . as the energy spectrum of a source changes , it moves through these diagrams .",
    "the timing properties of both the z and the atoll sources depend on the position of the source in the color  color diagram .",
    "the z sources move fast through the color  color diagram and draw up a z track within hours to days ( see e.g. gx 340 + 0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whereas the typical atoll sources move slowly through the color  color diagram and draw up a c  shaped track within weeks to months ( see e.g. 4u 172834 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the slow motion in the island part of the diagram , to the left hand and top sides , combined with observational windowing , tends to lead to the formation of isolated patches of data points , which is the origin of the term `` island state '' @xcite .",
    "whereas the continuum power spectra of the banana state are dominated by a power law component at low frequencies with perhaps a weak band  limited noise component ( which becomes stronger as the source approaches the island state ) , the island state power spectra are dominated by the band  limited noise . as the source moves away from the banana into the island state the count rate drops , the x",

    "they suggested that the atoll sources trace out similar three ",
    "branch patterns as the z sources , with the extreme island state cast in the role of z source horizontal branch .",
    "however , these authors did not address the timing properties of the sources they studied .    in this paper",
    ", we continue our work on the correlated x  ray spectral and timing behavior of z and atoll sources using rxte @xcite with an analysis of 4u 160852 . in these previous analyses ,",
    "we have found strong correlations between the behavior of the timing features and the position of the source in the color  color diagram in both z and atoll sources .",
    "4u 160852 is a transient source that shows outbursts with a recurrence time varying between 80 days and several years @xcite .",

    "it has been suggested that the parallel tracks in the plot of intensity versus frequency of the lower kilohertz qpo and the parallel tracks in the color  intensity diagrams might be the same phenomena @xcite .",
    "van der klis ( 2001 ) has proposed a possible explanation for this parallel track phenomenon in terms of a filtered response of part of the x  ray emission to changes in the mass accretion rate through the disk .",
    "the frequency versus intensity parallel  track phenomenon is particularly clear in 4u 160852 @xcite . in  [ sec.tracks ] we investigate the relation between these frequency versus intensity parallel tracks and the parallel tracks in the color  intensity diagrams .",

    "set we found 7 type i x  ray bursts and we exclude those ( @xmath5 s before and @xmath6 s after the onset of each burst ) from our analysis .",
    "we use the 16s time ",
    "resolution standard 2 mode to calculate the colors . for each of the five pca detectors ( pcus )",
    "we calculate a hard color , defined as the count rate in the energy band 9.7@xmath716.0 kev divided by the rate in the energy band 6.0@xmath79.7 kev , and a soft color , defined as the count rate in the energy band 3.5@xmath76.0 kev divided by the rate in the energy band 2.0@xmath73.5 kev . per detector",
    "we also calculate the intensity , the count rate in the energy band 2.0@xmath716.0 kev . to obtain the count rates in these exact energy ranges we interpolate linearly between count rates in the pcu channels .",
    "we calculate the colors and intensity for each time interval of 16 s. we subtract the background contribution in each band using the standard background model for the pca version 2.1e .    in order to correct for the changes in effective area between the different gain epochs and for the gain",
    "drifts within those epochs as well as the differences in effective area between the pcus themselves we used the method introduced by @xcite : for each pcu we calculate the colors of the crab , which can be supposed to be constant in its colors , in the same manner as for 4u 160852 .",
    "we then average the 16 s crab colors and intensity per pcu for each day . in figure [ fig.crab ]",
    "we can see the clear differences in the soft color trends of crab between the five pcus caused by the effects mentioned above . for each pcu we divide the 16 s color and intensity values",
    "obtained for 4u 160852 by the corresponding crab values that are closest in time but within the same gain epoch .",
    "we then average the colors and intensity over all pcus . if we multiply the soft color by 2.36 , the hard color by 0.56 and the intensity by 2400 c / s / pcu we approximately recover the observed , uncorrected values for 4u 160852 ( quoted values are averages of the crab colors during the observations over all five pcus ) . to improve statistics we rebin the 16 s color and intensity points to 256 s and exclude all data for which the resulting relative errors are larger than 5% .",
    "this led to a loss of about 40 ks of data at count rates below @xmath8 crab . for most of these data",
    "neither timing nor colors were of sufficient quality to determine the source state .",
    "starting may 12 , 2000 , the propane layer on pcu0 , which functions as an anti  coincidence shield for charged particles , was lost . however , as all our data after may 12 , 2000 ( @xmath9 ks ) was excluded because the relative color errors were larger than 5% this was not a issue in our analysis .    for the fourier timing analysis we use the 122@xmath10s time ",

    "one or more detectors were switched off .",
    "this , together with the short durations of the observations ( only @xmath21 s per observation ) led to bad statistics . in most cases it was impossible to identify any power spectral features , therefore the classification for this segment of the data",

    "a finer division would have compromised the statistics at low frequencies .",
    "the observations in this class where no lower ( or upper ) kilohertz qpo was detected were added based on position in the color  color diagram . in figure [ fig.cc_int ]",
    "we show the resulting 10 intervals in the color  color diagram and in figure [ fig.hid_sid_int ] we show the corresponding hard color and soft color vs. intensity diagrams .",
    "note that the data for which no power spectra could be computed due to data overflow ( see  [ sec.obs ] and [ sec.segment2 ] ) are not included in figures [ fig.cc_int ] and [ fig.hid_sid_int ] .",

    ", we can investigate how the parallel tracks in the frequency vs. intensity diagram relate to those in the color intensity diagrams .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the frequency ",
    "intensity tracks can not , as previously thought , be identified with the narrow vertical tracks visible in the color intensity diagrams of figures [ fig.hid_sid_int ] and [ fig.mendez_rate ] .",
    "each of these latter tracks corresponds to a single satellite orbit .",
    "the parallel tracks in the frequency vs. intensity diagram are only identifiable as ( rather fuzzy ) tracks in the color intensity diagrams after several satellite orbits have elapsed and thus turn out to be composed of several of those narrow vertical tracks .",
    "the parallel tracks in the frequency versus intensity diagram could also identified in the hard color  intensity diagram of 4u 163653 , where two banana tracks shifted by 20 % in intensity were observed in the hard color  intensity diagram @xcite , and exactly the same 20 % shift was observed between the corresponding two parallel lines in the frequency versus intensity diagram . in 4u 160852",
    "we do not observe complete banana tracks shifted in intensity as in 4u 163653 .",
    "the drift in x  ray flux in 4u 160852 already occurs on timescales of several days @xcite , too short for a complete track to form , where in 4u 163653 the source can stay on one track for several months @xcite .",
    "these fast changes in intensity in 4u 160852 are due to its transient character , where 4u 163653 is a persistent source for which changes in intensity occur much more gradually .",
    "note , that within each of the two parallel lines in the frequency versus intensity diagram of 4u 163653 there is no correlation observed between frequency and intensity .",
    "the narrow vertical tracks in the color intensity diagrams are caused by variations in color that for the most part can be explained by the scatter due to counting statistics .",
    "the parallel tracks in the frequency versus intensity diagram , although composed of data covering several consecutive satellite orbits , already show up within individual orbits due to a short term correlation between the lower kilohertz qpo frequency and intensity in combination with small errors in these quantities but persist over several consecutive orbits .",
    "the correlation between colors and intensity ( or kilohertz qpo frequency ) in individual orbits is veiled by the limited counting statistics , so in the color intensity diagrams the parallel qpo tracks can only be identified on the longer timescales of several satellite orbits .    to further illustrate this point in figure [ fig.mendez_sc ] we plot soft color versus the frequency of the lower kilohertz qpo ; lines connect the points of individual satellite orbits , and for clarity four representative individual orbits",
    "are highlighted in black .",
    "on orbit time scales , the lower kilohertz qpo frequency and soft color seem uncorrelated due to the counting statistics errors on the color , whereas on a longer time scale a clear correlation emerges .",
    "we note that for some parallel tracks in figure [ fig.hid_sid_int ] there is a correlation between color and intensity on short timescales , especially in interval j. in those cases the counting statistics are better due to the higher count rates and thus the parallel track phenomenon in the color diagrams is more similar to that in the kilohertz qpo frequency versus intensity diagram @xcite .",
    "however , in our interval j there is no timing feature present that is trackable on short timescales .    in conclusion we can now identify the parallel qpo tracks in the color intensity diagrams .",
    "bad counting statistics that shows up in the form of the narrow nearly vertical parallel tracks in the color intensity diagrams cause the @xmath57color correlation to be veiled on short timescales ( less than hours ) so in the color intensity diagrams the parallel qpo tracks can only be found for the longer timescales of several satellite orbits .",
    "we have studied the color diagrams and the power spectral behavior of the atoll source 4u 160852 .",
    "we found that the timing behavior of 4u 160852 is almost identical to that of the other atoll sources 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 .",
    "if we plot the characteristic frequencies of the timing features versus the characteristic frequency of the upper kilohertz qpo , together with the results of @xcite for 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 , the three sources follow the same relations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.freq_freq ] ) .",
    "also the behavior of the @xmath18 value is the same for the three sources .",
    "the general trends in rms fractional amplitude for 4u 160852 are also similar to those of 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 , but there is an offset between the relations for the three sources ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.rms_all ] ) .",
    "we connected the timing behavior with the position of the source in the color  color diagram and found that the timing behavior is not consistent with the idea that 4u 1608 - 52 traces out a three - branched z shape in the color - color diagram along which the timing properties vary gradually as is the case in in z sources .",
    "instead , the power spectral properties change along an `` @xmath20shaped '' track . finally , our measurements for the colors together with the precise measurements of lower kilohertz qpo frequency of @xcite gave us an opportunity to link the parallel tracks in the intensity versus color diagrams with the parallel tracks in the intensity versus lower kilohertz qpo frequency diagrams .",
    "we found that the parallel tracks in the frequency versus intensity diagram can be found back in the color ",
    "intensity diagrams as fuzzy structures ; they should not be confused with the narrow vertical parallel tracks visible in the intensity versus color diagrams which are mostly due to the errors in the colors .",
    "the power spectral properties in 4u 160852 change along an `` @xmath20shaped '' track .",
    "the question now arises whether the `` @xmath20shaped '' track we find in the color  color diagram of 4u 160852 is universal for atoll sources .",
    "we can compare our results with those of @xcite who studied the x  ray color and timing properties of a well sampled state transition of 4u 170544 where the source moves from the lower banana to the extreme island state and back .",
    "this transition was also included in @xcite who studied a larger dataset of 4u 170544 . in the color ",
    "color diagram the source moves from the lower banana , to the left of the extreme island state as the count rate decreases .",
    "then both the soft color and the count rate increase , whereas the hard color remains approximately constant , and the source traces out a horizontal track in the color  color diagram .",
    "then , while the count rate continues to increase , the source moves back from the right of the extreme island state to the lower banana @xcite . in the whole horizontal track",
    "the power spectra remained the same @xcite .    in this extreme island state 4u 170544",
    "did not reach characteristic frequencies as low as those in interval a of 4u 160852 ( it is very similar to interval b ) .",
    "if we look at the overall light and color curves of 4u 170544 presented in @xcite we see that apart from the extreme island state just described , which took place in the forty days around mjd 51230 , there is another extreme island state , with much sparser sampling , in which a higher hard color is reached . if we take a quick look at the timing of this mjd 51380 data we find that when the source reaches this higher hard color , the source shows a power spectrum very similar to that of interval a of 4u 160852 . as for the mjd 51230 extreme island state , during this mjd",
    "51380 extreme island state the count rate and the soft color increase simultaneously and in the color  color diagram another horizontal track is drawn up above the mjd 51230 one .",
    "returning now to 4u 160852 we note that in the state transition of 4u 160852 during the 1998 outburst ( see figure [ fig.cc_deel2 ] ) we observe the same phenomenon of a horizontal track being traced out in the extreme island state .",
    "the source is in interval c ( continuous time interval 12 in fig .",
    "[ fig.cc_deel2 ] ) for two observations , the first of which has a count rate about a factor two higher than the second .",
    "this higher count rate is accompanied by a 5 % higher soft color in the first observation .",
    "the power spectrum is the same in both observations .",
    "so , like the case of 4u 170544 , the change in count rate is accompanied by a correlated change in soft color which traces out a small almost ( the hard color changes slightly , see above ) horizontal track in the color  color diagram ( continuous time interval 12 in fig .",
    "[ fig.cc_deel2 ] ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this behavior of atoll sources in the extreme island state is the so  called `` secular motion '' in the color  color diagram .",
    "this phenomenon was first observed in z sources , in which the z  shaped track in the color  color and color  intensity diagrams is traced out within several hours up to a day . on longer timescales the whole z track shifts both in soft color and count rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the timing properties remain mostly unaffected by these shifts and are primarily determined by the position along the z track ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the same phenomenon has been observed in the banana state of the atoll source 4u 163653 @xcite .",
    "the horizontal tracks in the extreme island state of the atoll sources may be entirely caused by a secular motion , similar to that in the z sources . because the sources remain in one particular island state ( similar timing properties and hard color ) for a long time ( weeks to months ) , the slow process of secular motion has time to draw up a horizontal branch . in this horizontal branch",
    "the timing remains similar , as is the case for z source secular motion . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "this aspect of the behavior can be explained by the scenario that @xcite proposed to explain the parallel track phenomenon in the intensity versus lower kilohertz qpo frequency diagram .",
    "it seems that the z shape in the color  color diagram of some of the atoll sources is caused by transitions between the banana and the extreme island states that occur at different soft color .",
    "figure [ fig.schema ] provides a schematic of what in our interpretation occurs in these sources .",
    "several different horizontally extended extreme island branches appear above each other in the color  color diagram at different hard color values .",
    "these are traced out at different epochs . to first order",
    "only the hard color determines the timing properties . within each extreme island state the soft color changes in correlation with intensity . during state transitions",
    "the extreme island state is entered or left at a soft color value depending on intensity . a possible explanation for the fact that the timing remains similar while the intensity ( and thus soft color ) changes and that the state transitions can occur at different intensities ( soft colors ) is the scenario of @xcite where the truncation radius of the disk , which determines the timing properties and therefore the state , is not set by the accretion rate through the disk but by the ratio of this accretion rate over its long  term average ( c.f .",
    "so , if a source shows a state transition to an extreme island state at a minimum intensity which increases after that ( as happened in the mjd 51230 state transition of 4u 170544 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the source will enter the extreme island state at a lower soft color and move to a higher soft color as the intensity increases .",
    "if a state transition to an extreme island state takes place during a decay after an outburst of a transient source , we would expect that after the extreme island state is entered at a particular soft color , the source then moves to a lower soft color as it fades ( this and the reverse state transition from an extreme island to the banana state during the outburst rise were observed in aql x1 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our interpretation , the shape we observe in the color  color diagram of 4u 160852 is caused by observations of the source in extreme island states at different intensities and therefore at different soft colors .",
    "extreme island states a and b are observed at higher intensities than extreme island state c , causing c to have a lower soft color .",
    "contrary to the case in 4u 170544 and aql x1 we do not observe a large change in soft color ( or intensity ) within each extreme island state and it is unclear whether this is because the source was not observed sufficiently long or dense enough in these extreme island states , or whether this is a property of 4u 160852 .",
    "the three atoll sources , 4u 160852 , 4u 160852 and 4u 0614 + 09 , we have studied up to now ( * ? ? ? * this paper ) show a similar and very distinct timing behaviour ( figures [ fig.freq_freq ] and [ fig.rms_all ] ) .",

    "although 4u 160852 has a much larger range in intensity ( @xmath58 crab in the 2.016.0 kev range ) than 4u 0614 + 09 ( @xmath59 crab ) , 4u 160852 and 4u 0614 + 09 show a similar range in characteristic frequencies for the different power spectral components . for 4u 160852 @xmath24 ranges from 216 to 1061 hz ( excluding intervals i and j for which the identification of @xmath24 is uncertain see appendix [ sec.detailed_ps ] ) .",

    "the banana state ( our intervals e  j ) spectrum is soft and it is uncertain whether the soft component is due to the neutron star surface or the disk . to explain the spectral behavior of 4u 160852 @xcite use a scenario where in the island state the disk is far from the surface of the neutron star .",
    "the large radius of the inner disk prevents the disk from being observed directly in the pca spectra . in the island / banana state transition the inner accretion flow , which was geometrically thick and optically thin in the island state , collapses into a geometrically thin and optically thick disk .",

    "however , this lorentzian has a similar rms fractional amplitude for both 4u 160852 and 4u 0614 + 09 .",
    "the upper kilohertz qpos of 4u 160852 and 4u 0614 + 09 always have a similar fractional rms , whereas for l@xmath28 the fractional rms is always about 5 percentage points less in 4u 160852 than in 4u 0614 + 09 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.rms_all ] ) .",
    "this hints towards this component being l@xmath23 .",
    "* interval b * is similar to interval a , it shows l@xmath33 , l@xmath41 , l@xmath26 and l@xmath23 , but all at higher characteristic frequencies .",
    "interval b also shows a narrow qpo at 2.458 hz which will be discussed in  [ comp : timing : atoll ]",
    ". intervals a and b both show a component designated l@xmath26 , at @xmath31 and @xmath122 hz respectively .",
    "the broad l@xmath26 at these low frequencies can be tentatively identified with the lower kilohertz qpo based on extrapolations of frequency  frequency relations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , this lorentzian might also be an unrelated feature ( see  [ comp : timing : atoll ] ) .",
    "* interval c * shows only three components , l@xmath33 , l@xmath41 and l@xmath23 again all at higher frequencies than in the previous interval .",
    "* interval d * shows l@xmath33 , l@xmath28 and l@xmath23 .",
    "compared to interval c , l@xmath41 is no longer present and l@xmath28 has appeared .",
    "based on the similarities with 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 , l@xmath41 would be expected to be more narrow than in intervals a  c ( expected @xmath18 about 12 ) and have a characteristic frequency of about 30 hz .",
    "figure [ fig.powspec_1608 ] shows a non  significant narrow peak at @xmath123 hz in interval d which can probably be attributed to l@xmath41 .",
    "as noted above , l@xmath28 , a broad lorentzian with a constant @xmath14 of @xmath124 hz , appears in interval d for the first time . in interval",
    "a l@xmath28 would lie on top of l@xmath23 ( see above ) and in intervals b and c l@xmath28 would lie in the flank of l@xmath23 .",
    "therefore it is hard to detect l@xmath28 in intervals a  c .",
    "note that there is some excess power at the expected location of 150 hz in interval c. in interval d l@xmath23 has moved above this frequency range so that l@xmath28 is more easily detectable . both the frequency and the fractional rms of l@xmath33 in interval d",
    "are above the relations in figures [ fig.freq_freq ] and [ fig.rms_all ] . including the little peak at @xmath123 hz in the fit hardly affects l@xmath33 .",
    "these deviations from the relations in figures [ fig.freq_freq ] and [ fig.rms_all ] are most likely due to frequency shifts inside interval d , which covers a large range in the color  color diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.cc_int ] ) . splitting this interval",
    "further up would compromise the statistics .",
    "* interval e * shows l@xmath33 , l@xmath35 and a pair of kilohertz qpos . here",
    "the character of l@xmath33 has changed from a band  limited noise component ( fitted with a zero  centered lorentzian ) to a qpo .",
    "l@xmath28 is visible in the power spectrum but is not significant ( 2.4 @xmath12 single trial ) in this interval .",
    "because leaving it out of the fit makes l@xmath35 fit power up to hundreds of hz leading to an overestimated @xmath36 and rms fractional amplitude , we include a l@xmath28 at 150 hz ( the average value in 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 ) with @xmath125 ( see above ) in the fit . in table [ tbl.highfitpar ] and in figure [ fig.rms_all ] we only show the upper limit for this l@xmath28 .",
    "the characteristic frequency of l@xmath35 in interval e is still high compared to the general relation between @xmath36 and @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.freq_freq ] ) .",
    "this is similar to what was observed in 4u 172834 where in this range there are also two points where @xmath36 is significantly above the relation .",
    "these deviations all occur close to the l@xmath33 `` transformation '' and when the l@xmath33 qpo is still weak compared to the band  limited noise component l@xmath35 ( see fig . [ fig.rms_all ] ) , so one possible explanation is that in these transition power spectra a narrow and a broad l@xmath33 are merged together .",
    "the power spectra of * intervals f , g and h * all show very low  frequency noise ( vlfn ) , and l@xmath33 , l@xmath35 , l@xmath28 and the pair of kilohertz qpos all increasing in frequency . * intervals i and j * both show vlfn , l@xmath28 and a broad kilohertz qpo .",
    "it is unclear whether the kilohertz peak represents the upper , the lower or even a blend of both kilohertz peaks .",
    "there were no other power spectral features present which could be used to identify this component with the help of the correlations of figure [ fig.freq_freq ] . if these peaks , with characteristic frequencies of about 1050 and 1250 hz , would be the lower kilohertz qpo they would be among the highest frequency lower kilohertz qpos found in any source up to date ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "so to be slightly conservative and also because it is more convenient , as in figures [ fig.freq_freq ] and [ fig.rms_all ] we use the characteristic frequency of l@xmath23 to plot against , we list these kilohertz qpos as l@xmath23 . the @xmath18 values for the kilohertz qpos in intervals",
    "i and j are much lower than those in 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 .",
    "this is probably an artificial broadening due to the movement of the kilohertz qpo during the intervals . a finer subdivision of intervals i and j does not lead to observing l@xmath23 and l@xmath26 separately .",
    "note that no kilohertz qpos were found in the individual observations of these intervals @xcite .",
    "interval j shows an additional broad bump which is also seen in 4u 172834 ( interval 18 and 19 of figure 1 in * ? ? ? * ) and 4u 0614 + 09 ( interval 9 of figure 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this lorentzian can be identified as either l@xmath33 , l@xmath35 or a new type of lorentzian . here",
    "we list it as l@xmath35 .",
    "the vlfn in 4u 160852 shows a similar behavior to that in other atoll sources .",
    "the power law index is about constant around 1.5 , with the exception of interval f where it is 2.5 .",
    "the rms fractional amplitude generally increases with position in the color  color diagram . in intervals",
    "i and j the vlfn clearly deviates from just a power law .",
    "this leads to high @xmath22/dof values of 2.5 and 1.8 . adding lorentzians in interval i and j to fit the deviations leads to significantly better @xmath22/dof of 1.3 and 1.2 .",
    "the @xmath14 of the lorentzian in interval i is then 0.02 hz and in interval j 0.3 hz in interval i the lorentzian does not only fit the deviation but almost the entire vlfn .",
    "the inclusion of the lorentzians lowers the rms fractional amplitude of the power law to 1.59 % for interval i and 2.27 % for interval j.                                                                                                                                                               + 1 & 3 & 3 & 0.160.25 & h + 2 & 1 & 3 & 0.05 & d + 3 & 1 & 3 & 0.040.05 & i + 4 & 1 & 3 & 0.020.03 & d + 5 & 1 & 4 & 0.02 & c + 6 & 1 & 16 & 0.030.04 & d + 7 & 116 & 84 & 0.030.04 & b + 8 & 64 & 402 & 0.010.02 & c +   + 9 & 43 & 5 & 0.241.20 & j + 10 & 6 & 1 & 0.080.21 & fgh + 11 & 1 & 1 & 0.05 & e + 12 & 2 & 1 & 0.020.04 & c + 13 & 1 & 1 & 0.03 & e + 14 & 5 & 2 & 0.050.10 & i + 15 & 1 & 7 & 0.030.04 & fg + 16 & 7 & 38 & 0.040.05 & b + 17 & 119 & 523 & 0.030.05 & a +   + 18 & 1 & 4 & 0.060.07 & i + 19 & 1 & 2 & 0.03 & d + 20 & 1 & 7 & 0.01 & c + 21 & 1 & 3 & 0.03 & j + 22 & 1 & 9 & 0.01 & c + 23 & 1 & 12 & 0.02 & i + 24 & 1 & 4 & 0.01 & c + 25 & 1 & 4 & 0.020.03 & g + 26 & 1 & 4 & 0.02 & c + 27 & 1 & 4 & 0.070.08 & f + 28 & 6 & 2 & 0.030.11 & i + 29 & 1 & 2 & 0.01 & d + 30 & 1 &  & 0.01 & c +      lcccccccccccccc a &  &  & 0.247@xmath1260.012 & 0 ( fixed ) & 11.03@xmath1260.36 &  &  &  & 1.613@xmath1260.098 & 0.156@xmath1260.091 & 12.02@xmath1260.91 + b &  &  & 1.165@xmath1260.045 & 0 ( fixed ) & 9.97@xmath1260.19 &  &  &  & 6.17@xmath1260.27 & 0.56@xmath1260.11 & 9.73@xmath1260.96 + c &  &  & 3.22@xmath1260.32 & 0 ( fixed ) & 9.62@xmath1260.67 &  &  &  & 19.8@xmath1261.5 & 0.24@xmath1260.14 & 11.79@xmath1260.86 + d &  &  & 22.54@xmath1260.94 & 0 ( fixed ) & 15.09@xmath1260.25 &  &  &  &  &  & @xmath127 + e &  &  & 22.77@xmath1260.52 & 3.8@xmath128 & 4.46@xmath129 & 30.9@xmath1264.9 & 0 ( fixed ) & 10.4@xmath1261.0 &  &  & @xmath130 + f & 0.840@xmath1260.044 & 2.49@xmath1260.16 & 32.11@xmath1260.76 & 1.15@xmath1260.13 & 5.99@xmath1260.28 & 9.9@xmath1262.8 & 0 ( fixed ) & 3.16@xmath1260.42 &  &  & @xmath131 + g & 0.740@xmath1260.078 & 1.41@xmath1260.16 & 37.1@xmath1261.1 & 1.37@xmath1260.22 & 4.83@xmath1260.31 & 10.6@xmath132 & 0 ( fixed ) & 2.44@xmath133 &  &  &  + h & 1.180@xmath1260.025 & 1.537@xmath1260.041 & 47.4@xmath1261.1 & 2.08@xmath1260.35 & 2.68@xmath1260.18 & 15.4@xmath134 & 0 ( fixed ) & 1.98@xmath1260.26 &  &  & ",
