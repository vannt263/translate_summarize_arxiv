    "recent advances in film growth techniques and in the experimental control of spin - spin interactions have revived interest in the low temperature physics of thin films @xcite .",
    "these quasi-2d systems show a wide range of ordering effects including formation of striped states , reorientation transitions , bubble formation in strong magnetic fields , etc . @xcite .",
    "the origins of these phenomena are , in many cases , traced to competition between short ranged exchange ( ferromagnetic ) interactions , favoring a homogeneous ordered state , and the long ranged dipole - dipole interaction , which opposes such ordering on the scale of the whole sample .",
    "the present theoretical understanding of these phenomena is based on a combination of variational methods and a variety of approximations , , mean - field and spin - wave theory @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the predictions of these approximate methods and the results of montecarlo simulations are often difficult , because of the slow relaxation dynamics associated with the long - range nature of the dipole - dipole interactions @xcite",
    ". it would clearly be desirable to have more rigorous results about the spontaneous formation of such patterns . in a previous paper @xcite we began to investigate these questions by means of a spin - block reflection - positivity method which , combined with apriori estimates on the peierls contours , allowed us to :    _ ( i ) _ describe the zero temperature phase diagram of a 1d ising model with nearest neighbor ferromagnetic and long range , reflection positive , antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "these include power - law type interactions , such as dipolar - like interactions .",
    "we proved in particular the existence of a sequence of phase transitions between periodic states with longer and longer periods as the nearest neighbor ferromagnetic exchange strength @xmath0 was increased .    _",
    "( ii ) _ derive upper and lower bounds on the ground state energy of a class of 2d ising models with similar competing interactions , which agreed within exponentially small terms in @xmath0 with the energy of the striped state .    in this paper",
    "we prove for some models of dipole systems with discrete orientations , on a 2d lattice , that their ground states _ display periodic striped order_. as in the 1d case the stripe size increases with the strength of the nearest neighbor exchange interaction , becoming infinite , , giving a ferromagentic ground state , when the ferromagentic interaction exceeds a certain critical value . the proof is again based on a combination of reflection - positivity and peierls estimates and on an exact reduction of our 2d model to the 1d ising model studied in @xcite .",
    "the analysis takes explicit account of the tensorial nature of the 3d dipole - dipole interaction that , in the _ absence _ of any short range exchange , tends to produce order in the form of polarized columns ( or rows ) of aligned spins , with alternating polarization . for dipoles oriented along four possible directions at each site",
    "the ground state shown in fig.1 is @xmath1-fold degenerate ( spin reversal and @xmath2 rotations ) and these are the _ only _ ground states .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed description of pure dipole states and @xcite for some proofs .",
    "the order described in fig.1 is induced by the fact that two dipoles with the same orientation attract if their axes are parallel to their relative position vector , and they repel if both their axes are perpendicular to their relative position vector : in other words the dipole - dipole interaction , although overall antiferromagnetic ( in the sense that it prefers total spin equal to zero ) is , roughly speaking , ferromagnetic ( fm ) in one direction and antiferromagnetic in the orthogonal direction .",
    "it is then possible to show that , in the presence of an additional nearest neighbor ferromagnetic exchange , the fm order will persist in one direction . in the orthogonal direction",
    "the column - column interaction can then be effectively described in terms of a 1d model , which can be treated by the methods of @xcite .",
    "a similar method allows us to investigate the zero temperature phase diagram of the 2d discrete dipole model in the presence of a nearest neighbor _",
    "antiferromagnetic _ exchange , even in the case that the dipoles are allowed to orient along six different directions ( four in - plane and two out - of - plane ) . in this case",
    "we prove the so - called _ reorientation transition _",
    "@xcite , consisting in a flip from an in - plane ground state , like the one depicted in fig.1 , to an out - of - plane staggered state , as the strength of the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction is increased .",
    "the effects of the interplay between the tensorial dipole - dipole interaction and a short - range exchange interaction is still far from being understood in general systems of continuous ( heisenberg - like ) spins , or in general anisotropic models with different assumptions on the allowed spin orientations and/or on the short range exchange interactions .",
    "it is worth remarking that in these classes of models the naive procedure of minimizing the fourier transform of the pair interaction not only is wrong ( because it neglects the local constraints coming from the requirement that the norm of the spin vector at each site is equal to 1 ) but generally leads to very bad estimates on the ground state energy and on the size of the characteristic zero temperature patterns .",
    "however it is interesting to note that , for an @xmath3 spin model , @xmath4 , with a _",
    "scalar _ interaction whose fourier transform admits a non trivial minimum at @xmath5 , it is relatively simple to show existence of `` soft '' striped , , sinusoidal 1d spin wave , ground states .",
    "this was shown via a very general argument by nussinov @xcite for classical @xmath3 spins .",
    "this general result is independent of the dimension and of any reflection - positivity of the interactions .",
    "it is applied here to the concrete example of rotators in two dimensions interacting with a nearest neighbor ferromagnetic interaction and a weak long range _ scalar _",
    "@xmath6 interaction , , a scalar @xmath7 model with competing long range interactions , imitating the decay properties of the real dipole - dipole potential .",
    "the fact that the solution to this scalar isotropic problem is easy adds further motivation to the study of the harder and more exciting case of real dipole systems .",
    "( note that even the existence of the thermodynamic limit in an external field , which is expected to be shape dependent , is unproven for a 3d dipole system ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the 2d spin model with discrete orientations and state our results about its zero temperature phase diagram .",
    "this includes existence of striped order ( in the case of a short range ferromagnetic exchange ) and existence of a reorientation transition from an in - plane to an out - of - plane ordered state ( in the case of an antiferromagnetic exchange ) . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we discuss an example of a 2d rotator model with long - range scalar interactions whose ground states are given by sinusoidal 1d spin waves ( `` soft stripes '' ) . in sections [ sec4 ] to [ secanti ]",
    "we present the details of the proof for the 2d spin model with discrete orientations , both for the case of ferromagnetic and of antiferromagnetic exchange . in section [ sec7 ]",
    "we summarize some aspects of the conjectured positive - temperature behavior of dipole systems with competing interactions .",
    "the rigorous analysis of the phase diagram at positive temperatures is presently beyond our reach .",
    "some results and proofs in the present paper rely on those of the previous paper @xcite .",
    "we have discovered a minor technical error in the proofs of theorems 1 and 2 of @xcite which was caused by overlooking several exponentially small terms of the form @xmath8 which came from the use of periodic boundary conditions on a ring of length @xmath9 .",
    "these errors can be repaired , but we found that everything can be done more easily and clearly using open boundary conditions on the line rather than periodic boundary conditions on the circle .",
    "this improved methodology , which might be independently interesting for future work , is given here in appendix [ a ] .",
    "[ sec2 ] in this section we introduce the 2d model with discrete orientations and state the main results on the structure of its zero temperature phase diagram .",
    "we shall first discuss the stripe formation phenomenon in the presence of a nearest neighbor ferromagnetic interaction and then the reorientation transition phenomenon in the presence of an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction .",
    "let @xmath10 be a simple cubic 2d torus of side @xmath11 and let @xmath12 , @xmath13 , be an in  plane unit vector with components @xmath14 .",

    "we shall denote by @xmath20 the corresponding spin configuration space and , for later convenience , we shall define @xmath21 and @xmath22 to be the subspaces of vertical and horizontal spin configurations .",

    "the second sum in ( [ 2.1 ] ) runs over pairs of nearest neighbor sites in @xmath15 and the constants @xmath0 and @xmath26 will be assumed nonnegative .",

    "it has the effect of encouraging stripes , but this term alone can not create stripes . without the @xmath0 term the ground state would be as in figure 1 .",
    "one of the main result of this section concerns the zero temperature phase diagram of model ( [ 2.1 ] ) with @xmath28 , that is in the case that the long range dipole - dipole interaction is the `` real '' dipolar one .",

    "it could very well be that the same result is actually valid for any @xmath48 , but unfortunately we do nt know how to prove or disprove it .",

    "+ in summary , we prove that the ground state of ( [ 2.1 ] ) is a periodic array of stripes if the @xmath26 term is large enough , and more precisely : in the dipole case , @xmath28 , if @xmath26 is larger than a constant proportional to the period of the @xmath37 ground state ; in the yukawa case , @xmath49 , if @xmath26 is larger than a constant depending on the yukawa mass ( and diverging logarithmically as it goes to zero ) . the proof of theorems 1 and 2 in the @xmath37 case , described in section [ sec4 ] below ,",
    "is based on an exact reduction to an effective 1d model , to be treated by the methods of @xcite : as a byproduct of the proof , we also get explicit bounds for the energies of excited states .",
    "the extension to finite @xmath26 , both in the @xmath28 and @xmath49 case , is based on a peierls estimate on the energy of a droplet of horizontal spins surrounded by vertical spins .",
    "the proof of the peierls estimate is very simple under the assumptions of theorem 2 , that is in the presence of exponential decay with mass @xmath55 and of a large penalty @xmath26 ( large non uniformly in the mass @xmath55 ) ; this proof , together with the necessary definitions of peierls contours and droplets , is described in section [ sec5 ] . extending the result to the case @xmath57 and @xmath26 finite ( , the case considered in theorem 1 ) is highly non - trivial : in fact , since the long range potential decays as the third power of the distance , the naive dimensional estimate on the dipole energy of a droplet of size @xmath58 decreases as @xmath59 .",
    "so in order to exclude the presence of droplets of spins with the `` wrong '' orientation we have to use cancellations , that is we have to prove the presence of screening in the ground state . the proof is given in section [ sec6 ] .",

    "it is also expected that in the presence of a sufficiently strong uniform magnetic field , oriented perpendicular to the plane , the ground state should exhibit periodic order in the form of bubbles , , domains of spins parallel to the external field of quasi ",
    "circular shape @xcite .",
    "striped or bubble patterns are also expected on the basis of an effective ( mean field ) free energy functional in 2d electron gases @xcite , langmuir monolayers and liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "even less is known rigorously for positive temperatures . in particular",
    "it is unclear , even on a heuristic level , whether the expected striped or bubbled order for discrete spins should have strict long range order ( lro ) , or rather quasi",
    " long range order ( qlro ) characterized by order on short scales and a power law decay of the order parameter correlation functions .",
    "one of the few rigorous results , which we are aware of , about the positive temperature behavior of this class of systems is the recent proof by biskup , chayes and kivelson of the absence of ferromagnetism in @xmath73dimensional ising models with long range repulsive interactions , decaying as @xmath339 , @xmath340 , interactions @xcite .",
    "the models discussed here are related to a class of systems with kac potentials ( , long range potentials of the form @xmath341 ) considered by lebowitz and penrose in @xcite .",
    "there they computed the free energy density of a system of particles interacting via a short range interaction , favoring phase segregation , and a long range nonnegative definite kac potential .",
    "they showed that in the limit @xmath342 there is no phase transition in the thermodynamic sense , even though the pair distribution function has the form characterizing a phase transition , at least over length scales much smaller than @xmath343 .",
    "they concluded that the repulsive kac potential causes the distinct phases of a normal first - order phase transition to break into droplets , or froth , of characteristic length large compared to the range of the short range potential and small compared to @xmath343 .",
    "we do not know the scale of these domains , or even whether they destroy the first - order transition in 2d and 3d when @xmath344 is small but finite .",
    "in 1d we can show , using the method of reference @xcite , for @xmath345 , , on the macroscopic scale @xmath346 the period goes as @xmath347 .",
    "this is very reminiscent of what happens to the minimizers of continuum energy functionals used to model microphase separation of diblock copolymers and many other physical systems @xcite .    for heisenberg spins with long range interactions",
    "the hohenberg - mermin - wagner argument is not applicable and it could very well be that the long range tails stabilize phases against thermal fluctuations , even in two dimensions .",
    "this issue has been discussed in some detail for the case of rotators in two dimensions , interacting via a 3d pure dipole - dipole interaction @xcite : this is a case where linear spin - wave theory predicts non - existence of lro , while non - linear corrections and renormalized spin - wave theory seem to suggest that lro survives at positive temperatures .    for scalar fields describing the local magnetization or electron density in an effective free energy functional theory ,",
    "the general expectation is that in the presence of an anisotropy term ( possibly induced by the underlying crystalline structure ) qlro should survive at positive temperatures . on the contrary",
    "even qlro should generally be destroyed by thermal fluctuations in the case of isotropic interactions @xcite .",
    "the issue is rather subtle , however : analyses based on a hartree approximation would generically predict the presence of a first order phase transition from a high temperature disordered phase to a low temperature striped phase @xcite .",
    "if both predictions are correct , this class of models would exhibit a rather peculiar first order phase transition from a disordered state to a locally ordered state without strict lro .",
    "the issue has been investigated by jamei , kivelson and spivak @xcite in the context of 2d electron gases and by tarjus , kivelson , nussinov and viot @xcite in the context of the frustration - based appoach to the glass transition in supercooled liquids and structural glasses .",
    "jamei , kivelson and spivak argued that for 2d electron gases , in the presence of coulomb interactions , first order transitions ( as those predicted by brazovskii ) are not allowed and a sequence of transition between different mesoscopic patterned states should generically appear instead . on the contrary ,",
    "as discussed in @xcite , numerical simulations of frustrated spin models with coulomb interaction predict a finite jump in the energy at a critical line separating the paramagnetic state from a locally order striped state .",
    "refinements of the mean field or variational arguments seem very difficult : the natural effective continuum theories describing systems whose interaction has a fourier transform with a non - trivial minimum in @xmath348-space are , at least naively , non - renormalizable @xcite",
    ". it would be very interesting to provide convincing arguments for the patterned states to be ( globally ) stable against the presence of thermal or quantum fluctuations , as well as against `` generic '' perturbations in the form of long or short range interactions .",
