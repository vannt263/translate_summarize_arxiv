    "this restriction of the sum makes use of particle - hole symmetry , which relates the hamiltonian in eq.([eq : hamk ] ) at @xmath73 and @xmath103 by @xcite @xmath104 with the unitary matrix @xmath105 .",
    "we now set up the mf hamiltonian for the ( 101 ) slab and describe the determination of the gap parameters @xmath59 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 in the mf approximation .",
    "after fourier transformation in the directions parallel to the surfaces , the mf hamiltonian reads @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the number of unit cells of the slab and @xmath108 is the partially fourier - transformed nambu spinor .",

    "the mf hamiltonian satisfies particle - hole symmetry @xcite , @xmath117 with the unitary matrix @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the @xmath120 identity matrix .",
    "this symmetry again allows to restrict the momentum sums to half the bz .",

    "minimization of @xmath122 gives the gaps @xmath59 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the derivatives of @xmath122 with respect to the complex conjugate gaps can be calculated with the help of the hellmann - feynman theorem , for example @xmath123 the momentum sums are performed on a @xmath124 mesh , referring to the full surface bz .",
    "quadrupling the number of points in the mesh to @xmath125 leads to changes in the mf gaps on the order of only @xmath126% .",

    "numerical minimization making use of the explicitly known gradient is reasonably efficient .",
    "we use the broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno method implemented in numerical recipes @xcite .",

    "when we scan over ranges of temperatures , we use not only the converged values of the gaps but also the best approximate inverse hessian from one step as starting values for the next , which significantly speeds up the convergence .",
    "we assume that the method has converged when no real or imaginary part of any gap parameter changes by more than ( double ) machine precision in the last step .    for certain parameter values , we find nonvanishing gradients of the phases of the order parameters in the @xmath41 direction , normal to the surfaces .",
    "specifically , we find four metastable solutions , which are mapped onto each other by inverting the phase gradients at one or both surfaces . in the limit @xmath53 , the four solutions are degenerate .",
    "for finite @xmath44 , they split into two degenerate pairs with phase gradients that are even and odd , respectively , under reflection at the center of the slab .",
    "we here choose a solution with even phase gradients since then the selfconsistent solution ensures that the phases of @xmath59 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 become equal at the center of the slab ; equal phases of all gaps at the center are expected since the bulk mf solution has equal phases . by a global phase change",
    "we can then make the phase of all gaps zero at the center .",
    "the phases and imaginary parts of the gaps are then odd under reflection at the center . finally , of the two remaining solutions differing in the sign of the imaginary parts of the gaps , we select the solution with @xmath127 for definiteness .",

    "<S> many ncss display evidence of gaps with line nodes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is exciting , as the line nodes of ncss with dominant triplet pairing are topologically nontrivial defects in momentum space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> zero - energy flat bands of majorana fermions are predicted to appear within the projections of these nodal lines onto the surface brillouin zone ( bz ) . </S>",
    "<S> such flat bands have clear experimental signatures such as sharp zero - bias peaks in tunneling spectra @xcite , equilibrium currents parallel to the interface between the ncs and a ferromagnet @xcite , and characteristic quasiparticle interference patterns  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the topological properties of ncss and consequently the protection of the surface states are controlled by the superconducting gaps , which arise from interactions . </S>",
    "<S> properly accounting for these interactions may qualitatively alter the surface physics . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a surface tends to suppress some gap components and enhance others @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may change the conclusions of the aforementioned studies @xcite , which imposed unrealistic uniform gaps . </S>",
    "<S> flat bands with their high density of states are particularly prone to instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the zero - energy flat bands at the @xmath0 surface of _ d_-wave superconductors with time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) @xcite are predicted to be unstable towards a time - reversal - symmetry - breaking ( trsb ) state @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> it is interesting to examine how states at different @xmath73 contribute to the spin polarization : due to the strong polarization of the flat - band surface states in the trs state @xcite , one might expect that the spin polarization largely originates from the shifted flat bands . </S>",

    "<S> _ equilibrium currents_.  furthermore , the absence of trs permits a nonzero equilibrium surface current @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we expect such a current since the surface bands become dispersive and the dispersion is odd in @xmath64 ; a similar modification of the electronic structure at an interface with a ferromagnet does result in a surface current @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> however , the thermal average of the source terms vanishes , and charge conservation is retained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the current perpendicular to the slab s surface , i.e. , in the @xmath41 direction , must vanish . </S>",
    "<S> mirror symmetry in the @xmath74 plane forbids a current along the @xmath43-axis @xcite , leaving only the current along the @xmath42 direction , defined as @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath80 is indeed nonzero in the trsb state : in fig.[fig.sycurm](a ) we plot the current as a function of the layer index @xmath41 , which shows that it is bound to the surface with spatial profile similar to the spin polarization . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the spin polarization , the main contribution to the current stems from surface states within the projected nodal rings , as shown by the momentum - resolved current in a half slab plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.sycurm](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied the contributions to the vanishing components @xmath81 and @xmath82 , shown in the supplemental material  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , @xmath81 cancels only in the sum over the full surface bz , showing that bulk states must be included to satisfy charge conservation . note </S>",
    "<S> that the sign of both the spin polarization and the current is reversed for the degenerate solution with complex - conjugated gaps .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupling to the electromagnetic field , which is not included here , leads to additional screening currents that exactly balance the spontaneous surface current in the limit @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> however , these currents build up on the length scale of the magnetic penetration depth @xmath9 , which in typical ncss is much larger than the decay length of the surface current , on the order of the coherence length @xmath83 @xcite . in samples with thickness smaller than the penetration depth but larger than the coherence length </S>",
    "<S> , it should thus be possible to detect the surface current .    </S>",
    "<S> _ summary and conclusions_.  we have studied the stability of zero - energy flat bands at the surface of an ncs within selfconsistent mf theory . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the flat bands are indeed recovered by the selfconsistent calculation within a broad temperature range below the bulk transition temperature @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> trs is spontaneously broken at a much lower temperature @xmath68 , which is signaled by a nonuniform phase of the gaps . </S>",
    "<S> this destroys the topological protection for the flat bands , shifting them away from zero energy and giving them finite velocity . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig.disp ] shows that at low temperatures the flat bands are displaced by an energy on the order of @xmath68 , which is significantly smaller than the bulk gaps of order @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy gain due to the shift of the flat bands is likely a major driver of the trsb state , and ultimately limits @xmath68 as the free energy gain from the shift is reduced by the broadening of the fermi function .    </S>",
    "<S> the trsb state leads to clear experimental signatures : a splitting of the zero - bias peak in the tunneling spectrum , a nonvanishing spin polarization at the surface , and a nonvanishing equilibrium charge current parallel to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the latter two effects show that the trsb state found here is qualitatively different from that predicted for the @xmath0 surface of cuprate superconductors  @xcite .    _ </S>",
