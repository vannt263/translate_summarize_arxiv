    "in his classic text @xcite on the various interpretations of quantum mechanics jammer comments  after having devoured some 500 authors and their proposed solutions to the quantum enigmas :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the endless stream of publications suggesting new theories of measurement and modifications of ideas earlier proposed as well as the unending discussions and symposia on this topic are an eloquent indication of the general discomfort felt among the physicists on this issue . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    finland , a country of a thousand conferences , has also assumed its responsibility for keeping the quantum symposia carousel spinning .",
    "the city of joensuu has been an active part sponsoring a series of conferences on _ the foundations of modern physics _ ( 1977 , 1985 , 1987 , 1990 ) .",
    "however , this year even joensuu is hemorrhaging because of the general economic backlash . despite this it was possible to arrange a minispymposium during some sunny days in the beginning of june at the physics department of the university of helsinki with its kind support @xcite .",
    "the  stars  of the symposium consisted of the triumvirate made up of bernard despagnat ( orsay , france ) , abner shimony ( boston , usa ) and asher peres ( haifa , israel ) .",
    "despagnat has achieved a reputation ( vide @xcite ) as an incisive analyzer of the conceptual - philosophical foundations of quantum mechanics , and for having introduced the concept of the  veiled reality  which refers to something that can not by studied by traditional scientific methods  he suggests that poetry maybe offers a link to this reality .",
    "peres started his physics career as nuclear engineer .",
    "he gives the impression of a hardnosed problem solver but with talents of a comedian not unlike woody allen .",
    "other physicists have classified him as a positivist , among them abner shimony who is a very jovial professor who feels at home among neutrons .",
    "he describes himself as student of carnap , and he is able to give a penetrating lecture on some subtle points by kant or berkeley at any time .",
    "car engines he finds , however , to be difficult to understand ; indeed , this involves an important philosophical point ( complicated phenomena should be reduced to simple constituents which are easier to understand ) . with the lectures of the symposium as a background we will in the next sections discuss some central issues in quantum mechanics .",
    "despagnat defines his philosophical view as  open realism  ; existence precedes knowledge ; something exists independently of us even if it can not be described .",
    "berkeleyean idealism , phenomenalism , positivism , anti - realism , internal realism and similar philosophies assume that one only observes mental pictures , not objects , whence there is no need to presuppose the reality of objects per se . shimony summarizes berkeley s arguments for idealism in two points :    * the description of things only involves thoughts * matter ( quantity ) can not explain perception ( qualia )    despagnat s objections against idealism rest on two propositions :    * experience and knowledge implicate the existence of consciousness ( mind ) * one may be wrong ( reality  says no  ) ; that is , just any theories do not work , there is something (  objective reality  ) which resists    coming as far as samuel johnson ( kicking the famous stone to refute berkeley ) and accepting a reality , despagnat asks whether this reality is intelligible .",
    "indeed , quantum mechanics challenges any physicist - philosopher with realist inclinations , which albert einstein realized from early on .",
    "einstein pointed to the apparently instantaneous ",
    " collapse of the wave functions ; an aspect that was brought to its head in the famous einstein - podolsky - rosen paper @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded immediately that the fundamental point of the epr - argument was the  entanglement  of the composite system .",
    "thus , two systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 constitute through interaction a total system @xmath2 whose state vector in general is of the form    @xmath3    where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) belong to the hilbert space @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) for the system @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "if we , as schrdinger did , identify the state of an object / system with its statevector , it follows that for an entanglement state ( [ eq:1 ] ) ( which in general can not be factorized on the form @xmath8 ) the subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath1 will lack definitive physical states .",
    "this conclusion also applies with regards to the physical properties if we identify these with the eigenvalues of the corresponding operators .",
    "therefore , even if the total system @xmath2 is in a definitive state this does not in general apply for its subsystems .",
    "this consequence makes quantum mechanics , according to despagnat quoting h weyl ,  the first holistic theory that works  . at the same time",
    "this property creates problems for every attempt to make an ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics which ascribes to all systems / objects definitive physical states and properties at every instant of time .",
    "the entanglement situation arises also in the case where the system @xmath0 is an object which interacts with an apparatus @xmath1 during a measurement process . in order that the process should result in a definitive state @xmath9 of the measurement apparatus",
    "it is necessary that the superposition eq.([eq:1 ] ) is reduced on the factorized form @xmath8 which is generally impossible in quantum mechanics .",
    "indeed , the quantum mechanical evolution @xmath10 is linear and preserves superpositions , @xmath11 .",
    "assume that an ideal measurement process transforms the initial state @xmath12 into @xmath13 :    @xmath14    here @xmath15 denotes the initial state of the measurement apparatus while its state @xmath16 registers that the object was in the state @xmath17 .",
    "if we apply the linear property of the quantum evolution on the initial state @xmath18 it follows that the object + apparatus evolves into an entanglement state :    @xmath19    which contradicts the fact that the measurement apparatus has to be in a definitive state .",
    "this entangled situation is the central issue of the problem of measurement in quantum mechanics .",
    "despagnat distinguishes three genuinely ontological approaches to quantum mechanics :    1 .",
    "pilot - wave theories ( de broglie , d bohm ) 2 .   other hidden variable theories @xcite 3 .   theories of dynamical reduction @xcite    according to the pilot - wave theories @xcite the objectively existing particles are directed by a field @xmath20 which , at least approximately , satisfies the schrdinger equation ( se ) .",
    "if we write the field @xmath20 as    @xmath21    with real functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , then the se is decomposed into two equations :    @xmath24    the first line in eq.([eq:5 ] ) corresponds to the classical hamilton - jacobi equation with an additional  quantum potential ",
    "@xmath25 ,    @xmath26    while the second line in eq.([eq:5 ] ) corresponds to a continuity equation .",
    "the field @xmath20 directs the particle according to the following generalization of newton s equation :    @xmath27    the equality @xmath28 is , according to @xcite , satisfied only as an average of a statistical process whose probability density during normal circumstance coincides with @xmath29 .",
    "l de broglie proposed that the wave equation has two sorts of solutions ( double - solution theory ) : the ordinary se solution which only describes the statistical behaviour of the particles , and a singular solution which represents the localized particles themselves .",
    "a o barut has recently presented a similar theory where the singular solutions of de broglie corresponds to a soliton ,  small psi  , while the ",
    "big psi  is the conventional schrdinger wave function which can only be interpreted statistically @xcite .",
    ", where @xmath20 is the electron field , then its current is undefined in entanglement situations since we can not ascribe a definitive field to the electron .",
    "barut has given an interesting response in a letter to be commented elsewhere .",
    "] bohm s theory does not say anything about the structure of the particles ( except that they have classical properties like momentum and position ) .",
    "his primary objective has been to demonstrate the very possibility of an ontological quantum theory @xcite . to the group ( b ) above one",
    "might count e.g. theories of the sort presented by dennis dieks , simon kochen and richard healey @xcite . similarly to the group ( a ) -theories , these theories distinguish between two kinds of states : on the hand the quantum state ( represented by the wave function ) , on the other hand the physical / dynamical state which is always defined for all objects in contrast to the quantum states which may not be defined in entanglement situations . in these approaches",
    "the starting point is a special bi - orthonormal decomposition ( which goes back to e schmidt 1907 ; vide @xcite ) of the entanglement state eq.([eq:1 ] ) :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are orthonormal basis vectors . in case @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) this decomposition is unique ( the other cases cause trouble ) .",
    "according to dieks eq.([eq:8 ] ) means that the systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be ascribed physical states @xmath31 and @xmath32 with the probability @xmath35 . especially in the case of eq.([eq:3 ] ) this assumption by dieks implies that the measurement apparatus exists in definitive physical states represented by the eigenstates whose statistical weights are determined by the coefficients @xmath36 .",
    "healey suggests the possibility of developing a stochastic - dynamic theory which will describe the evolution of these dynamical / physical states .    the fact that despagnat includes",
    "the third group above among the genuine ontological theories may seem a bit surprising .",
    "the dynamical reduction theories mainly show that the superposition states for macroscopic systems get suppressed .",
    "the entanglement issue remains alive for the micro - objects , as well as also for the macro - objects during the time till the superposition has been reduced beyond practical verification .",
    "no ontological states have been ascribed to the subsystems in the entanglement state .",
    "the same objection can be raised against theories which explain the reduction in terms of influence of the environment , which despagnat indeed rejects as non - ontological .",
    "the difference seems to be that despagnat assumes that the wave function in case of the dynamical reduction theories describes an independent reality ( again causing trouble in the entanglement situation ) , while the environmental theories describe a  subjective reality  . yet",
    ", both kinds of theories seem equally ambiguous on this point .",
    "despagnat however reasons that the environment theories presuppose an ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics which implies that quantum mechanics can not describe individual systems and hence must be incomplete ; ergo , the environment theories can only explain the wave collapse by extending quantum mechanics with ",
    "hidden variables  .",
    "this is the solution chosen e.g. by dieks who combines his ontological commitment with environment theories ( decoherence ) in order to explain how the physical states are realized in the measurement process .",
    "for despagnat the wave function is not an element of the physical reality , rather it represents an ensemble .",
    "reality per se ( being ) is either  pure x  ( kant ) or  veiled  .",
    "the former alternative leads to idealism which is rejected by despagnat .",
    "idealism e.g. presupposes that the concepts are evident ( anschaulichkeit , kant ; lumen naturale , descartes ) which seems to be in conflict with the fact that we now and then have to revise our concepts and theories as a consequence of new findings and theoretical developments .",
    "concerning the veiled reality despagnat is only able to tell that it transcends human reason ( and is in this sense  irrational  ) .",
    "it can not be studied using scientific methods which are restricted to the  empirical reality  .",
    "professor shimony plans to devote the next few years attempting to derive the wave collapse by manipulating the se .",
    "the ghirardi - weber - rimini ( gwr ) ansatz constitutes the archetypical model @xcite .",
    "the non - linear gwr - modification of the se can be interpreted as a stochastic process where the wave function for each particle is reduced , according to a poisson - process with a characteristic time constant @xmath37 s , on a wave function which localizes the position to a region of the dimension @xmath38 m ( vide @xcite ) .",
    "that is , the wave function @xmath39 evolves according to the se except for random occasions ( separated by an average time @xmath40 ) where it makes a",
    " quantum jump  and is reduced on the form    @xmath41    according to the gwr - ansatz .",
    "the reduction center @xmath42 is chosen randomly according to the probability density    @xmath43    in terms of the density matrix @xmath44 the gwr - process implies that during an average period of @xmath40 the @xmath44 is replaced by @xmath45 with the gaussian weighing eq.([eq:10 ] ) ; that is , @xmath46 yielding @xmath47 . taking also into account the ordinary se , @xmath48",

    "always clear how they interpret the wave function . in case",
    "it represents the physical state we are still left with the entanglement problem for micro - objects .",
    "the ensemble interpretation seems to be the other alternative but this interpretation denounces the collapse problem from the very outset  vide ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.10 ) and @xcite . )",
    "the gaussian weighing is defined by    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the position operator .",
    "the gwr - process has no observable consequences for an elementary particle since the reduction happens only about once every 10@xmath52 year . however , if consider a composite system of @xmath53 particles then eq.([eq:11 ] ) is replaced by    @xmath54 + \\lambda \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\left(t_i(\\rho ) - \\rho \\right),\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 denotes the gaussian weighing for the @xmath56-th particle localization operator @xmath57 .",

    "a wave - packet @xmath69 , which describes ( it s not clear what this  describes  exactly means in the gwr - approach ) a macroscopic body represented by its cm - position @xmath58 ,  contracts  every 10@xmath70:th second to a region of the size @xmath71 10@xmath70 m . in this model",
    "macroscopic bodies seem to have definitive cm - positions modulo circa 10@xmath70 m ; thus , a pointer wave function can not exist in a superposition of two positions @xmath72 and @xmath73 satisfying @xmath74 m .",
    "this conclusion holds only in the sense that the off - diagonal terms @xmath75 decreases exponentially ; that is , the absence of superposition of the @xmath72- and the @xmath73-state takes an infinite time to reached .",
    "according to the definitions above we get ,    @xmath76    which in combination with eq.([eq:15 ] ) results in    @xmath77.\\ ] ]    this asymptotic decline of the interference does not satisfy shimony . besides the energy @xmath78 is not conserved in the gwr - theory but increases with ca 10@xmath79j per second for a macroscopic system .",
    "this follows because a contracted wave packet represents a higher kinetic energy than a plane wave having the same momentum",
    ". the wave function @xmath80 for a free particle ( plane wave ) contracts @xmath81 times during the time interval @xmath82 on a wave packet @xmath20 of the dimension @xmath83 .",
    "this is associated with a momentum dispersion of the size @xmath84 corresponding to a kinetic energy @xmath85 :    @xmath86    since @xmath87 = @xmath88 and @xmath89 = @xmath90 for a plane wave .",
    "the increase of energy during the interval @xmath82 thus becomes ,    @xmath91    apparently we need an energy input in order to sustain the gwr - process",
    ".    with regards to the modifications of the se shimony proposes at present only the general equation vacuum = lethe (= the river of oblivion ) , and suggests that the experimental results of the quantum telegraphy involving 3-level systems may provide constraints on the possible modifications of the se .",
    "( the quantum telegraph is connected with the so called quantum zeno effect @xcite which in the 3-level case has been treated as a system coupled to a reservoir .",
    "the zeno effect denotes the situation where a continuous observation of an unstable system prevents it from decaying ; the observation reduces the wave packet constantly to the initial state . the watched pot effect is another illustrative name for the effect . )",
    "the non - conservation of the energy ( still quite minimal corresponding to a temperature increase of 10@xmath92k year for an ideal gas @xcite ) in the gwr - theory may indicate that it describes an open system and that the gwr - equation eq.([eq:11 ] ) represents an ansatz to an  effective  se for a system coupled to its environment .",
    "one might think of an analogy with the  effective  lagrange - functions ( or actions ) used in qft which incorporate some of the effects of vacuum polarizations and other interactions . from this point of view",
    "one ought to derive the  effective  se from a fundamental theory of interacting particles , given that the ordinary se is valid for closed systems and free particles .",
    "one aspect of this problem is studied for objects interacting with a reservoir @xcite .",
    "all the decay processes can be related to this case .",
    "a classical model is formed by an harmonic oscillator @xmath83 ( the object ) coupled to a surrounding represented by a set of oscillators @xmath93 , according to the hamiltonian ,    @xmath94    here @xmath95 denotes the creation operator of the @xmath83-oscillator , while @xmath96 refers to the oscillators representing the environment .",

    "eq.([eq:20 ] ) is the foundation of the weisskopf - wigner equations , kramers - kronig relations , pauli master - equations , quantum mechanical langevin- and fokker - planck equations .",
    "the common property for these systems is that they represent irreversible decays ( dissipation , friction , diffusion ) whose time - asymmetric forms contradict the timesymmetric nature of the fundamental equations .",
    "the exponential decay can not be derived from the se in senso stricto , which has i.a .",
    "been observed by eugen merzbacher ( quoted by @xcite ) :  the fact remains that the exponential decay law , for which we have so much empirical support in radioactive processes , is not a rigorous consequence of quantum mechanics but the result of somewhat delicate approximations ",
    "similar considerations apply in classical mechanics ",
    "reversible hamiltonian equations can not lead to dissipative processes .",
    "an apparently elementary phenomenon such as friction seems to lack theoretical foundation .",
    "@xcite has employed examples like the above ones to argue for the primary role of the approximations ( phenomenological equations ) in physics at the expense of the exact ( fundamental ) equations , which seldom describe the empirical reality but rather some finely tuned models .",
    "cartwright points out that @xcite in the beginning only derived an exponential decay term from eq.([eq:20 ] ) .",
    "however , after the discovery 1947 by willis lamb and r c retherford of the  lamb - shift  between the levels @xmath101 and @xmath102 in hydrogen ( @xmath103 = 0.437 10@xmath104ev = 1058 mhz ) did hans bethe also find the lamb - shift hidden in eq.([eq:20 ] ) using a new approximation procedure @xcite .",
    "cartwright s conclusion is that  the schrdinger equation does not make a claim whether there is a lamb shift in the circumstances described  . in a sense",
    "we use the equations in order to obtain results we already know , not in order to predict them ; that is , we can calculate the transition probabilities using born approximations etc , but the very fact of the transition as an event can not be accounted for by quantum mechanics ( which einstein already pointed out ) .",
    "the gwr - model however introduces the reduction already on the micro - physical level .",
    "there are also models that introduce dissipation on the micro - physical level through non - linear modifications of the se ; one example is the ansatz ( setting @xmath105 = 1 )    @xmath106    by @xcite where @xmath107 is a quantum friction coefficient ( for a generalization see @xcite ) .",
    "the problem with these models seems to be that the conventional theory approximates quite well the experimental results whence there is little room for modifications of the se .",
    "thus it has been suggested @xcite that a non - linear se @xcite may imply the possibility of superluminal commincations in contradiction with the special theory of relativity .",
    "@xcite argues that such modifications may also lead to communications ( everett phone ) between different branches of a multi - verse wave functions .",
    "( his example involves a non - linear hamilton operator which depends on the observer s choices , whence it is no surprise that he concludes that  the apparatus reads the observer s mind  . in physics",
    "we had rather expect the  observer  to be described by an hamiltonian . ) as a conclusion we might say that the most reasonable interpretation of the non - linear modifications of the se which implies energy non - conservation is that they are about open systems ; the equations should therefore be based on some fundamental theory of interaction .",
    "one approach to the problems involving object - reservoir / environment - interaction , which seems to be shared by i.a . @xcite and @xcite , is to be content with the approximative irreversible solutions of eq.([eq:20 ] ) .",
    "the idea is that we observe irreversible processes because we can not observe the whole ( reversible ) process ; information is lost to the environment ( dissipation = displacement of information ) .",
    "the approximative assumptions leading from eq.([eq:20 ] ) to the irreversible solutions are based on an assumption of some sort of memory loss ; e.g. , restricted correlation with the surrounding ( markov ansatz ) . in the classical analysis l",
    "boltzmann introduced 1872 the stosszahlenansatz according to which the colliding atoms ( hard spheres in the model ) loose their  memory  of their state before the collision .",
    "this entails an obvious time - asymmetry ( for a simplified version of the boltzmann analysis see @xcite ) .",
    "the classical navier - stokes equation in hydrodynamics is also based on a form of memory loss represented by the viscosity term ( for derivations of such phenomenological equations from fundamental principles see @xcite ) .",
    "theories and interpretations which attempt only to account for the practically measurable ( in a statistical description ) by using various forms of  memory loss  and coarse graining can be called fapp theories ( fapp = for all practical purposes ) .",

    "this yields ,    @xmath155    from the definitions it follows that @xmath156 is equal to    @xmath157    we observe that @xmath158 and @xmath159 again satisfy the eq.([eq:30 ] ) with the integral    @xmath160    from this it follows that    @xmath161    assuming the initial values @xmath162 are real quantities we obtain finally    @xmath163    omns concludes that the superposition of states 1 and 2 ( @xmath164 ) is suppressed for large enough time @xmath165 .",
    "common to all the decoherence models , the above included , is that they can not prove the superposition between macroscopic states vanishes in a finite time .",
    "( several models employ the riemann - lebesgue lemma in order to show that @xmath166 when @xmath167 , vide @xcite ) .",
    "dieks accepts the dechoerence models as solutions to the measurement problem in union with his ontological assumption ; the decoherence means that the  real / physical  states approaches definitive values in the measurement process .",
    "omns observes that the exact solutions to eq.([eq:30 ] ) ( for a finite number @xmath53 of oscillators ) predict a poincar recurrence ; that is , for any given time @xmath165 there is a time @xmath168 such that ( @xmath169 ) approaches the initial state ( @xmath170 ) arbitrarily closely which contradicts the exponential law of decay eq.([eq:35 ] ) .",
    "( for atoms which interacts with single mode fields , @xmath53 = 1 , one obtains explicitly periodic solutions which manifested in rabi - flopping , or jaynes - revival of apparently collapsed atomic states , see @xcite ) . according to omns",
    "this means that even classical physics entails a fuzzy logic ( since poincar recurrence applies to classical mechanics , see @xcite ) which are in harmony with the  apparent  validity of the decay law .",
    "he compares the statistical probability of the poincar recurrence with the probability that the earth would suddenly move , through quantum tunneling , and start to circle around sirius .    a general class of decoherence models attempts to demonstrate that the superposition between two , say orthogonal , quantum states @xmath171 and @xmath172 of an object is suppressed by a coupling to the environment ( @xmath9 ) , by which the superposition is turned into    @xmath173    the idea is to show that @xmath174 ( compare with @xmath175 in eq.([eq:40 ] ) ) which is equivalent to the reduced density matrix    @xmath176    approaching the diagonal form    @xmath177    this may be interpreted as a proof for the wave collapse ; that is , that the superposition eq.([eq:41 ] ) has collapsed on either of the states @xmath171 or @xmath172 .",
    "the density matrix provides us though only with a statistical description ( averages and probabilities ) and can not hence prove that an actual collapse takes place in which a superposition @xmath178 ends up in a definitive state @xmath179 .",
    "it can thus not predict an event ( the object assuming definitive states / values ) . a statistical description may allow a body to be at one place at one moment , and then at another moment  with no continuous passage through the space  to appear at another place ( whose position is only statistically determined ) .",
    "this argument is presented i.a . by cartwright as a demonstration of the need to accept the wave collapse as a physical process and not merely as a statistical description",
    "@xcite has moreover observed that it is always possible in principle to find an operator @xmath180    @xmath181    by which one can construct @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the hamiltonian which describes the evolution of the object + environment during the measurement process .",
    "this operator @xmath184 satisfies    @xmath185    thus by measuring the operator @xmath184 we can detect an interference between ( @xmath186 ) and ( @xmath187 ) ; that is , the measurement of @xmath184 will demonstrate the difference between the superposition state @xmath188 and the reduced form .",
    "we get    @xmath189    while the reduced form @xmath190 eq.([eq:42 ] ) neglects all observables associated with the environment .",
    "supporters of the fapp - models , such as omns , rejoin that the proposed observables @xmath184 are in practice not measurable .",
    "the probability that such",
    " supermeasurements  will yield non - trivial results is  much smaller than the limit one must accept for classical logic ",
    "asher peres agrees  it is impossible for us to keep a tab on all the environmental variables .",
    "the wave collapse , according to peres , is nothing more than the result of the necessity to restrict the observation to a subsystem in which the loss of information will be manifested by reduced density matrices and equations involving irreversibility . for peres the interpretational problem in quantum mechanics concerns a translation from the language of hilbert space structure to the language of the classical phase space .",
    "this translation from the language of quantum mechanics to the language of classical physics then gives rise to the irreversibility as an aspect of the languages ( displacement of information ) .",
    "quantum mechanics with its unitary time evolutions is not a theory of events , according to peres  he defines quantum mechanics as  a limiting case for infinite systems with no back - reactions  .",
    "similarly @xcite also links the wave packet reduction to a limited information capacity .",
    "one consequence of zurek s ideas is that if    @xmath191    is satisfied for two states @xmath192 , @xmath193 , for practically measurable observable @xmath180 ( for which one can construct a corresponding measurement device ) , then    @xmath194    is not a proper superposition state .",
    "instead its meaning is that the object either is in the state @xmath192 or @xmath193 ( with 50 % chance for either ) .",
    "the condition eq.([eq:46 ] ) entails that @xmath192 and @xmath193 are  effectively superselected  , and it can be compared with the principle of state distinction ( psd ) advanced by schrdinger : states of macroscopic systems that can be told apart by macroscopic observations remain separated whether observed or not @xcite ; that is , the state eq.([eq:47 ] ) can not be a superposition state .",
    "this criterion can be applied to the schrdinger cat state    @xmath195    when it is assumed that the states ",
    "dead  and  living  can be distinguished through a non - obtrusive observation . the psd - principle might be connected to the superselection condition in the following way : psd is based on the assumption that the observation of the macroscopic system changes it only by adding a phase factor and that this does not change the physical situation . according to this , the states    @xmath196    should be equivalent for real numbers @xmath197 .",
    "this means that no interference can be detected between @xmath192 and @xmath193 ; that is , the superselection condition eq.([eq:46 ] ) is valid for every measurable operator . in the case of eq.([eq:48 ] ) the condition @xmath198 implies that the cat can not be revived using any such operator @xmath180 .",
    "the superselection condition in the sense of zurek is linked to irreversible transitions @xmath199 where no realizable operator can return @xmath193 to @xmath192 .",
    "classical  properties of systems / bodies are the ones superselected by the environment .",
    "this contextual definition of system properties has been elaborated within the @xmath200-algebra approach to the quantum theory of  infinite ",
    "abner shimony distinguishes two traditions within philosophy and science :    * one tradition which tries to  close the circle  between epistemology and metaphysics ; theories should not only describe the phenomena but also explain their existence and connect them with their ontological basis . within this tradition shimony counts members like einstein , aristotle , leibniz and whitehead . * the other tradition studies epistemology ( the condition for knowledge and phenomena ) without an ontological grounding . as representative members shimon mentions bohr , kant , hume , nietzsche and the linguistically oriented philosophers ( wittgenstein ? ) .",
    "shimony expresses sympathy for the former alternative since it is , from a ",
    "global  perspective , more fruitful , has a larger explanatory force and aims at a coherent world view .",
    "these arguments are not unlike the ones presented by max planck in support of realism ( in _ vortrge und erinnerungen _ , 1949 , discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "shimony presents a parable ( a movie projected on a screen ) which can be compared to the cave parable invented by plato where chained prisoner in the cave were only able to see shadow of people on the walls .",
    "the movements of the shadows seem chaotic and incomprehensible till they realize that the shadows are produced by real bodies and their movements . according to shimony it is equally reasonably to assume that all physical phenomena have an ontological grounding which can explain their cause and nature ( a causal argument for micro - objects ) . by applying this philosophy to the wave collapse in quantum mechanics",
    "it follows that we should attempt at finding a physical explanation for the collapse , for instance by modifying the se as suggested by shimony .",
    "professor k v laurikainen , who has played a central role in arranging the physics symposia in finland , has followed a different track in his lectures .",
    "he thinks the question of reality is a psychological question .",
    "the meaning of the wave collapse is that the observer becomes aware of the measurement results ; the wave collapse takes place in the mind of the observer , according to laurikainen . from this point of view one",
    "may understand the claims that the psyche must be taken into consideration in discussing the foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "peres rejoins that consciousness is only involved in the presentation of the measurement data , not in the measurement process itself .",
    "shimony is more sympathetic and he would prefer a mentalistic ontology ( objective idealism ) to pure physicalism , but he can not accept laurikainen s point of view which he summarizes as that the consciousness causes the wave collapse .",
    "however , laurikainen does not accept this interpretation and emphasizes that the collapse takes place _ in the consciousness_. yet if consciousness has no causal role in the wave collapse then there are few reasons to believe that it plays any physical role whatsoever in the measuring process ( besides the  trivial ",
    "fact that physicists and engineers have designed the experiments and the devices ) .",
    "the assumption that the wave collapse takes place in the consciousness implies in the end that everything takes place in the consciousness , all objectifications are a mental process . that leads us back to machian positivism which defines physics as a part of psychology , as an economic description of perception data and mental states .",
    "perhaps not such an inspiring idea for physics .",
    "the measurement process involves fundamental physical principles which are responsible for the pauli - exclusion ( explaining e.g. electron  shells  ) , superfluidity , radioactive decay , bragg - interference , etc . in none of these cases",
    "is the mind presumed to be a causal factor . on the contrary",
    ", the physical theories have been developed to explain why we see all these different phenomena .",
    "however , by this it is not implicated that consciousness can be reduced to the motion of electrons and protons ( or behaviouristic reflexes of the larynx ) .",
    "it seems obvious that thoughts / feelings are not equivalent to ( but probably contingent / supervenient ) with particle states in the way e.g. an electric current is equivalent with a collective motion of electrons .",
    "this is the lasting cartesian insight ( or  common sense  ) into the dualism between res extensa ( matter ) and res cogitans ( soul ) .",
    "quantum mechanics has not been able to transcend this dualism despite some quantum mystical trends @xcite .",
    "yet it is natural to expect that quantum mechanics as a fundamental theory will have consequences for the understanding of the  psycho - physical parallel  ; that is , the  correlation  between the physical and mental states ( the mind - body problem ) .",
    "thus , @xcite envisaged that the mind implicates a non - linear se since it can not be described in terms of the conventional linear se . according to his friend - argument",
    "an observer can not exist in a superposition of the form    @xmath201    which is presumed by the conventional quantum mechanical formalism in the schrdinger cat cases .",
    "wigner introduces consciousness as a causal agent as it causes the wave collapse .",
    "another approach is to attempt at constructing quantum mechanical models for the  brain states  .",
    "thus , @xcite has suggested a model for brain states based on the boson condensate model presented by @xcite .",
    "( such approaches will be discussed in a separate paper . for a discussion of quanta , mind and brain",
    "see @xcite . )",
    "laurikainen however does not express any interest in such models .",
    "he sees the lack of strict causality in nature as an evidence of a pan - psyche in the nature .",
    "while descartes and newton found evidence of the hand of god in the lawfulness of the universe , ] laurikainen finds clues for pantheism in the  irrational  quantum indeterminism . without arguing against or for pan - psychism",
    "one may still be inclined to think that a direct philosophical - theological linking to quantum mechanics would put an end to physics ( laurikainen for instance rejects the application of quantum mechanics to cosmology by pointing to the constraining concept of the observer @xcite ) .",
    "however there are still jobs to do for theoretical physics ; for instance , little attention has been paid to the problem of deriving  classical  collective variables from quantum mechanics .",
    "one possibility is that quantum mechanics is not valid for macroscopic bodies .",
    "this question has been studied in a series of papers by @xcite in connection with quantum effects in superconducting materials .",
    "finally , the question of the relation between quantum mechanics , relativity and gravitation still remains wide open .",
    "we expect to return to this question when the appropriate occasion arises . ",
    "in the paper there are expressions of the form @xmath202 that surely seems odd to a mathematician . of course , in physics ,",
    "what is  big  and  small  depends on the context .",
    "generally it is a question of comparing the order of magnitudes .",
    "thus , e.g. @xmath203 may be understood as @xmath204 .",
    "what is  small  relates to the question on what can be considered as ",
    "negligible  in a given context . in physics",
    "we can not expect absolute certainty or infinite accuracy .",
    "but where to draw the boundary between blissful ignorance and anomalies ?",
    "if a theory or a model predicts quantities to a precision of @xmath205 , then any experimental deviation larger than @xmath205 would naturally be interpreted as a refutation of the theory / model .",
    "because of our finitude ( one of the kantian themes ) there appears to be a limit to the precisions @xmath205 we can attain .",
    "for instance the energy non - conservation implied by the gwr - process seems to be negligible for all practical purposes . on the other hand , the discussions of fine tunings related to the cosmological  constant  @xmath206 have revealed that even the 100th decimal of @xmath206 may be of far reaching consequence for the evolution of the universe .",
    "as far as the physical world ( or rather our description of it ) is subjected to stringent laws , expressed e.g. in terms of differential equations , problems involving fine tuning can hardly be avoided .",
    "of course it is a logical possibility that our  laws of physics  are valid only in some restricted range of parameters and that there is no bottoming out .",
    "while our _ descriptions _ of nature in physics are formulated in terms of more or less rigorous and exacting mathematics @xcite , nature is not mathematics ( pardon platon ! ) .",
    "mathematics and experiments give a measure of how  close  , in a sense , our descriptions and the nature ( or some local  domain  of it ) touch each other on some point .",
    "perhaps a successful  theory of everything  would just be another reminder of that we are enclosed in a  bubble  of ignorance , stranded on a  selfcontained  island , or chained prisoners in platon s metaphorical cave ?",
    "prof k v laurikainen was a primus motor behind the series of symposia on the foundations of modern physics that were arranged in finland 1977  1994 , and which attracted the topnotch investigators in quantum mechanics from over the world .",
    ", besides the introductory courses by kalle huhtala , was the most rewarding lectures in physics which i have ever experienced in finland  @xcite . ]    as a student laurikainen was greatly influenced by the mathematician rolf nevanlinna and the philosopher eino kaila @xcite both who with a deep interest in theoretical physics . in 1947",
    "nevanlinna arranged for a scholarship enabling laurikainen to study in zrich where he for the first time met wolfgang pauli whose writings would later become one the chief sources for laurikainen s philosophical inspiration . under the guidance of prof torsten gustafson ( lund , sweden )",
    "laurikainen completed a thesis in 1950 on the gravitational energy of electromagnetic fields .",
    "lamek hulthn then got him interested in the problem of the deuteron which lead him to become an expert in computational physics . back in finland , first as a teacher and professor in turku , then in helsinki ( 1960 - 79 ) , he became one of the main champions , in company with nevanlinna and prof karl - gustav fogel ( bo akademi , turku ) , of theoretical physics as a field within physics . at that time physics in finland was predominantly experimental . in 1961",
    "it became possible to major in theoretical physics .",
    "the research institute for theoretical physics started in 1964 and it got its own building in 1969 called the  laurikainen building  .",
    "besides launching computational physics laurikainen also played an instrumental role in getting finland involved in particle physics and later to become a member of cern .",
    "thus many physicists have felt a great obligation toward laurikainen for his contribution to the postwar reconstruction of physics research in finland .",
    "when laurikainen retired he embarked on equally vigorous projects centered on the study of wolfgang pauli s philosophical writings @xcite . in fact , he was scheduled to defend his thesis @xcite in philosophy on 22 .",
    "august 1997 , when he died a month before ( 13.7 ) .",
    "while laurikainen s philosophical project attracted little support among his colleagues and former students , laurikainen was able to help arrange a successful series of international conferences in finland on the foundations of physics .",
    "these symposia , centered on the foundational question of quantum mechanics , were right on the target at that time .",
    "interpretational issues were again coming to the forefront of physics , one reason being the improved experimental methods for probing questions such as entanglement .",
    "it was also becoming possible to mention  philosophy  and  metaphysics  at physics conferences without being immediately labeled a crackpot .",
    "the symposia also succeeded in assembling an older generation of physicists who had had a direct interaction with the ",
    "founders  such as heisenberg and bohr . as a student",
    "i think i was quite fortunate in having this opportunity , via the conferences , to follow the discussions by many great physicists from around the world .",
    "i remember names ( in no particular order ) such as k bleuler , c f v weizscker , y neeman , j p vigier , d bohm , a zeilinger , h stapp , r b griffiths , s kochen , c piron , p busch , p mittelstaedt , p lahti , m jammer , n rosen , a aspect ... to name only a few . again",
    "the legacy of laurikainen was that he created a framework where people could meet and discuss new and old ideas and findings . despite the fact that he hardly ever got a wholehearted support for his philosophical views , and was sometimes severely criticized , he remained polite and supportive toward everyone interested in discussing the issues .",
    "laurikainen remained faithful to the  copenhagen interpretation  but criticized bohr for having avoided the ontological questions ."
