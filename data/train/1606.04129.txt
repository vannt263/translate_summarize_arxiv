    "here we provide more details about the derivation of the effective two body ( four fermion ) interaction introduced in eq .   in the main text .",
    "the procedure to obtain this term for the dimer model is to identify the dimer hilbert space with a subspace of the @xmath2 model hilbert space and project the @xmath2 hamiltonian eq .   accordingly .",
    "we identify the state with zero dimers of any kind with the state with zero electrons for the @xmath2 model .",
    "the rest of the hilbert space for the dimers can be introduced via the operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the phases @xmath81 represent a gauge choice and we shall follow the one by rokhsar and kivelson @xcite and define @xmath82 and @xmath83 , here @xmath84 is the y - component of the dimer co - ordinate . given the conventional inner product for the electron hilbert space ,",
    "the dimer basis is not orthonormal and therefore does not serve as a convenient basis to calculate matrix elements .",
    "this can be resolved by gram - schmidt orthogonalization . in general ,",
    "if we denote the basis elements of the dimer hilbert space by @xmath125 and the overlap matrix between states @xmath126 , then an orthonormal basis for the hilbert space is given by  @xcite : @xmath127 it is not too hard to check that the matrix @xmath128 is a real symmetric matrix @xmath129 and therefore @xmath130 . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath131 , i.e. , the new states are orthonormal .",
    "the hamiltonian projected onto this basis is given by  @xcite : @xmath132 to leading order , @xmath133 as the dimers are nearly orthogonal . to show this consider two states @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "we can form the loop graph of @xmath134 and @xmath135 by deleting all the dimers that @xmath134 and @xmath135 have in common .",
    "the rest of the dimers will form loops ( with dimers from state @xmath134 and state @xmath135 alternating along a loop ) . if there is a loop of length 2 , that is two dimers of different type on the same link then @xmath136 , so we have @xmath137 for those states . assuming there are no such links we have that all loops are at least length four .",
    "now the overlap of @xmath134 and @xmath135 is the product of overlaps over all loops .",
    "furthermore it is known that the overlap between two loops is exponential in the length of the loop @xcite .",
    "since all loops are of at least length four ( rather long ) to leading order we may set the overlap matrix to zero if there is at least one loop or the states @xmath134 and @xmath135 are different",
    ". now the states are normalized to unity so we have @xmath133 .    the pairing term ( four - fermion interaction )",
    "comes from the spin - spin term in the @xmath2 model , namely @xmath85 .",
    "let us focus on a single plaquette term and consider eight relevant states for the dimers on this plaquette , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we notice that the hamiltonian @xmath89 is zero in the triplet channel .",
    "this means that the effective hamiltonian for the dimers @xmath138 is also zero in the triplet channel .",
    "indeed , the spins of the dimers are the same as the spins of the electrons for the @xmath2 model , so the projected hamiltonian has the same spin structure .",
    "as such we might as well restrict the spins of the dimers to lie in a singlet ( there are two such states per plaquette with the two dimers lying either along the x - axis or along the y - axis ) .",
    "moreover , the projected hamiltonian is diagonal in this basis .",
    "indeed the bare hamiltonian @xmath89 contains no hopping terms for the electrons , only spin flip terms .",
    "as such the only terms that could contribute to off diagonal matrix elements come from states of the form @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( and linear combinations thereof ) which belong to both dimer configurations ( along the x - axis and along the y - axis ) .",
    "however the hamiltonian annihilates such states and the projected hamiltonian has no corresponding hopping terms . by symmetry",
    "the hamiltonian when restricted to the singlet subspace is a multiple of the identity matrix .",
    "its value is given by :    @xmath141    and , within the spin - singlet channel , the hamiltonian is @xmath91 .",
    "correspondingly , we can add to our hamiltonian in eq .",

    "all the hamiltonians written in this section have a direct interpretation in terms of hamiltonians for the dimers ( they all correspond to various dimer hopping terms and terms that count the number of flippable dimer plaquettes ) .",
    "note that it does not matter whether the hamiltonians we produce respect the constraint in eq .",
    "as in the path integral formulation we insert projectors onto the physical space @xmath188 at every time slice . the hint towards how to do this extension comes from the expressions derived around eqs .   and   in the main text .",
    "indeed in order to apply a hs transformation to our expressions we need to write our hamiltonian ( when restricted to a single plaquette ) schematically in the form @xmath189 where @xmath190 and @xmath191 are single particle operators for one species of dimer , either bosonic or fermionic ( see the main text e.g. eqs .  , and  ) .",
    "the main idea is to replace @xmath192 .",
    "here @xmath193 , @xmath194 are single particle operators either bosonic or fermionic which are identical to @xmath190 and @xmath191 except they now carry an index @xmath181 . as such each hs transformation given in the main text corresponds to a different large @xmath174 hamiltonian . in the large @xmath174 limit , with this extension , we present models where the hs mean - field becomes arbitrarily accurate .",
    "qualitatively we expect mean - field theory to become more and more accurate as each particle interacts with @xmath174 particles with an interaction strength that is attenuated by @xmath195 .",
    "we now proceed to give several examples of this procedure .",
    "we note that none of the hamiltonians have any dependence on @xmath128 .",
    "in particular we can replace    @xmath196    where @xmath28 is arbitrary and each value of @xmath28 produces a different hamiltonian .",
    "similarly we have @xmath197 where again @xmath37 is arbitrary .",
    "the bose / fermi part may be extended to the large @xmath174 limit in a similar manner .",
    "for instance @xmath198    the four fermion term in the hamiltonian ( see eq .  ) is given by spin spin interactions and has a variety of large @xmath174 extensions which were previously tabulated  @xcite .",
    "we will not repeat this procedure here .",
    "we note that , to produce superconductivity , the optimum extension is given by the @xmath199 formalism  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to do a hs decoupling on all these terms , based on the following identity @xmath200\\,.\\label{eq : hubbard_stratonovich_large_n}\\ ] ]    the mean - field equations ( stationary points of this integral ) are given by @xmath201 and @xmath202 . from this",
    "we see that the mean - field is simply a sum of @xmath174 copies of the mean - field for a single species problem and we can replace @xmath203 and @xmath204 , where @xmath190 and @xmath191 are single particle operators .",
    "there is one saddle point which reduces to @xmath174 copies of the mean - field theories found in the main text .    in the limit where @xmath174 goes to infinity ,",
    "the mean - field results become exact , see ref .",
    "( section 17.2 ) . the derivation given in ref",
    ".   works verbatim for our case .",
    "indeed an integration over the bosonic and fermionic fields that appear in the partition function of our theory ( for which the hamiltonian is quadratic ) may be performed to obtain : @xmath205\\,,\\label{eq : action_large_n}\\ ] ] where @xmath206 are all the possible hs fields which we may introduce .",
    "the only dependence on @xmath174 is the overall scaling @xmath207 of the action . using an argument identical to ref .",
    "( section 17.2 ) it is possible to show that higher loop corrections to the partition function in eq .",
    "vanish as @xmath208 , where @xmath209 is the number of propagators and @xmath210 is the number of loops .",
    "as such all the higher loop corrections vanish when @xmath211 , making mean - field exact .",
    "to discuss the various symmetries of our systems we focus for simplicity on the case when @xmath212 for arbitrary @xmath128 ( this does not entail any additional complexity beyond the physical case of @xmath213 ) .",
    "consider the gauge transformation where we assign a @xmath16 phase to each vertex of our system , namely where each boson and fermion operator @xmath8 and @xmath9 on each link transforms as : @xmath214 any hamiltonian that preserves the constraint @xmath215 is automatically invariant under the @xmath16 gauge transformation in eq .  .",
    "indeed any hamiltonian that preserves the constraint in eq .   can be written as a sum of monomials each of which is a product of creation and annihilation operators . in order to preserve the constraint eq .",
    "we mush have the same number of creation and annihilation operators for the bosons / fermions at every vertex ( otherwise the constraint is no longer satisfied ) . under this condition , the total phase from phase factors in eq .",
    "associated with each vertex vanishes , leading to an invariant hamiltonian . in particular , one can explicitly check that the hamiltonians in eqs .   in the main text are invariant under the gauge transformation given in eq .  .",
    "is gauge compatible ( here @xmath217 is an arbitrary constant ) .",
    "one simply has to transform the variables @xmath218 and @xmath219 in the opposite way as the gauge transformation for the bosons . focusing on a single plaquette and labeling the lower left corner site as @xmath14 with the other sites @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 , the gauge transformation for the hs bosons is given by : @xmath223z_{i , j}\\nonumber \\\\ w_{i1/2 } & \\rightarrow\\exp\\left[i\\left(\\theta_{i}-\\theta_{i+\\hat{x}+\\hat{y}}\\right)\\right]w_{i1/2}\\nonumber \\\\",
    "w_{i3/4 } & \\rightarrow\\exp\\left[i\\left(\\theta_{i+\\hat{x}}-\\theta_{i+\\hat{y}}\\right)\\right]w_{i3/4}\\,.\\label{eq : gauge_transformation_hubbard_stratanovich}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similar considerations can be made about the boson fermion and the fermion fermion part of the hamiltonian in the main text ( in particular the hs transformations in eqs .   and",
    "are completely gauge compatible ) .    from this",
    "it would appear that the solutions to our mean - field equations lead to a large degeneracy of mean - fields .",
    "indeed it would seem that any gauge transformation of the mean - field solutions leads to a different solution with the same energy and as such a different ground state .",
    "however , this is not the case : there is only one state of the physical system that can be obtained from two different states that differ by a gauge transformation .",
    "more precisely , after we project onto the physical subspace via the projection operators @xmath224 , eq .  , two states that differ by a gauge transformation given in eq",
    ".   project onto the same state up to an unobservable overall phase . to show this , without loss of generality ,",
    "assume that under the gauge transformation in eq .",
    "the state with no bosons / fermions transforms into itself , @xmath225 .",
    "now an arbitrary state may be written as a linear combination of terms of the form : @xmath226 after projection we may as well assume that there are exactly @xmath128 @xmath227 s at every vertex @xmath14 in the expression in eq .  .",
    "under a gauge transformation ,      we can group the phases associated with every vertex together and , because of the constraint that there are exactly @xmath128 bosons / fermions at any vertex , this gauge transformation becomes a state independent phase : @xmath229      here we consider the projective symmetry group ( psg ) construction , again focusing on the case where @xmath212 .",
    "the main idea behind the psg ( which was originally introduced for spin systems  @xcite ) is that in order for a mean - field state to be invariant under a symmetry transformation of the system ( e.g. , a translation or a rotation ) , the mean - field ansatz needs not remain invariant under the transformation but needs only be invariant following a gauge transformation of the form in eq .",
    "( which does not change the state of the systems as discussed previously ) .",
    "using this observation we may define the psg of a mean - field ansatz  @xcite as the set of all lattice transformations followed by gauge transformations ( as in eq .  ) which leave the mean - field ansatz invariant .",
    "an important subgroup of the psg is the igg ( invariant gauge group ) which is the set of all gauge transformations in eq .   that leave the mean field ansatz invariant .",
    "we will now proceed to calculate the igg for various lattices .",
    "we only focus on hs generated mean - fields of the form in eq .   which are gauge transformation compatible via eq .   and ignore all other mean - fields .",
    "it can be checked directly that the mean - fields obtained by considering the fermion fermion or fermion boson part of the hamiltonian do not change the value of the igg .",
    "we begin with bipartite lattices , with sublattices labeled by @xmath190 and @xmath191 . the first constraint we obtain by the gauge transformation in eq .",
    "is that @xmath230 , i.e. , it is gauge invariant and therefore it gives no further restrictions on the form of the gauge transformations .",
    "the second constraint is that @xmath231w_{i1/2}\\nonumber \\\\ w_{i3/4 } & = \\exp\\left[i\\left(\\theta_{i+\\hat{x}}-\\theta_{i+\\hat{y}}\\right)\\right]w_{i3/4}\\,.\\label{eq : constraint_regular}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we assume that the terms @xmath219 are non - zero ( otherwise the mean - field lattice loses connectivity and breaks up into one dimensional sublattices ) . in this case we have that @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "therefore the igg for a bipartite lattice ( assuming the terms @xmath218 are zero ) is simply @xmath234 where there are two different phases living on the two sublattices @xmath190 and @xmath191 .    when the decoupling fields @xmath218 are non - zero , we have the constraint @xmath235=\\\\ = \\exp\\left[2i\\left(\\theta_{a}+\\theta_{b}\\right)\\right]=1\\ ; , \\end{array}\\label{eq : constraint_superconducting}\\ ] ] so that @xmath236 and the igg becomes @xmath237 .",
    "adding fermions does not change the @xmath237 .",
    "one simply gets another copy of the same set of equations .",
    "qualitatively this is because the hs fields transform in a way determined by the transformation properties of fermion or boson bilinears under eq .  .",
    "since the bosons and fermions transform in the same away under eq .  , it does not add any new `` information '' ( or constraints ) to consider fermions .",
    "if we consider non - bipartite lattices , the constraint @xmath230 again does not effect the igg . on the contrary , the constraints in eq .",
    "insure that the phases @xmath18 and @xmath238 for any two sites that can be reached by a finite number of translations along lines joining second nearest neighbors along a plaquette is the same . since any two sites on a non - bipartite lattice",
    "may be joined that way , the igg when the @xmath239 is @xmath16 , i.e. , the same phase for every site .    when the terms @xmath240 do not vanish , we have that @xmath235=\\exp\\left(4i\\theta\\right)=1\\;,\\end{array}\\label{eq : non_bipartite}\\ ] ] which means that the igg is now given by @xmath241 . adding fermions does not change the @xmath241 , as once again we get multiple copies of the same equations .",
    "the psg for the boson / fermion system may be computed directly .",
    "for example one can check that the algebraic psg for the dimer system is the same as the algebraic psg for a bosonic spin liquid on the same lattice with the same igg  @xcite . indeed",
    "the gauge degrees of freedom are identical and the `` commutator '' constraint equations  @xcite are of the same form for the same lattice and the same igg ."
