    "the ads / cft relation , discovered in the framework of string theory @xcite , has surpassed its natural cradle to spread into the realm of condensed matter by means of the holographic construction @xcite .",
    "in such a case , it does not matter much what is the type of the black hole in the ads space as a physical object , but rather what is the cft theory described in the process .",

    "higher order corrections to the gravity counterpart have been often used , but a general discussion is still missing @xcite .    here , we are going to discuss details of the higher order corrections to gravity and their consequences for the holographic field theory .",

    "such a result , originally relying upon ostrogradsky @xcite long ago on very general grounds has been rederived in simple terms @xcite . nevertheless , there are theories with complex dynamics involving higher order terms in the lagrangian but whose equations of motion are at most second order in time @xcite .",

    "such a result seems to be a general feature of lovelock theories with @xmath70 since the gravity theory reduces to chern - simons gravity in these cases .",

    "the dynamics of probe scalar fields in higher dimensional lifshitz black holes ( d=5, ... ,10 ) do not show an oscillating phase either @xcite .",
    "thus , at least in case of lovelock gravity with @xmath70 and lifshitz black holes , the purely damped modes are related to the higher curvature terms .    also , we observe that the effect of adding charge to the black hole is to increase the quasinormal frequency value .",
