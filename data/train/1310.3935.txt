    "some details on the modeling will be given below .",
    "the variable  @xmath1 is one - dimensional , varies on the real line  @xmath2 , and models a quantity homogeneous to a stress ( actually to a certain entry of the stress tensor ) .",
    "the variable  @xmath3 of course denotes the time , and equation   is supplied with some initial condition @xmath4 .",
    "the unknown real - valued function  @xmath5 , solution to  , satisfies the two properties : it is nonnegative @xmath6 and normalized to one @xmath7 for all times  @xmath8 . the function  @xmath9 models the density of probability to have a certain ( elementary microscopic ) stress  @xmath1 , at time  @xmath3 , at a macroscopic space position  @xmath10 . the actual , deterministic stress within the fluid is thus given by @xmath11 , of equation   below .",
    "equation   is thus implicitly parameterized by this position  @xmath10 ( thus the multiscale nature of the problem , as will be seen below ) .",
    "the function  @xmath12 , also a function of time , is assumed given .",
    "it models the shear rate at the position  @xmath10 , under which we wish to compute , using  , the mesoscopic response of the fluid .",
    "the notation  @xmath12 is traditional in fluid mechanics , hence its use here . in  ,",
    "we denote by  @xmath13 the characteristic function @xmath14}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 a scalar positive parameter , fixed once and for all .",
    "it models some local threshold value of the stress , which plays a crucial role in the modeling .",
    "as is usual , we denote by @xmath16 the dirac mass at zero . from the definitions of  @xmath13 and  @xmath16 , it is immediately seen",
    "that , at least formally ( and this will indeed be made rigorous , see lemmata  [ lem : max ] and  [ lem : mass ] in section  [ sec : properties ] below ) , equation   preserves in time the two properties   and  .",
    "two quantities are typically computed using the solution  @xmath9 to  : first the so - called _ fluidity _ @xmath17 and next the ( real - valued ) stress @xmath18 our purpose in this article is to mathematically study equation   ( in terms of existence and uniqueness of the solution  @xmath9 , properties and long - time behavior of that solution ) and to derive a macroscopic equation equivalent to this equation . by _",
    "macroscopic _ equation , we mean an equation ( actually a differential equation , or a system of differential equations ) that directly relates the shear rate  @xmath12 , the fluidity  @xmath19 and the stress  @xmath20 without the explicit need to compute  @xmath9 . in these macroscopic equations",
    ", the scalar @xmath21 will be the inverse of the mechanical relaxation time , thus its name `` fluidity '' .",
    "we will be able , in particular , to obtain a macroscopic equation which is close to models that have been proposed for aging fluids  @xcite , see the discussion at the end of section  [ sec : passage ] .",
    "[ [ some - elements - on - the - modeling ] ] some elements on the modeling + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    equation   is the simplest possible form of an equation describing the mesoscopic behavior of a complex fluid , such as a concentrated suspension , or more generically a soft amorphous material , with properties intermediate between those of a fluid and those of a solid .",
    "these materials exhibit a highly non - newtonian behavior and may give rise to a macroscopic yield stress .    at low stress , such a material behaves in an elastic way .",
    "but above a certain stress threshold , here denoted by the critical value  @xmath22 , one observes a relaxation toward a completely relaxed state .",
    "this behavior is modeled by equation  .",
    "the probability of finding the fluid in the state of stress  @xmath1 at time  @xmath3 evolves in time for two different reasons : the term @xmath23 models the modification of the stress induced by the existence of the shear rate , while the term @xmath24 encodes the relaxation toward zero of the part of the stress above the threshold  @xmath22 . from a probabilistic viewpoint ,",
    "the stochastic process @xmath25 associated to the fokker - planck equation   evolves deterministically when @xmath26 and jumps to zero with an exponential rate @xmath27 when @xmath28 .",
    "the process @xmath25 belongs to the class of _ piecewise - deterministic markov processes _ , which have been introduced in the probabilistic literature in the 1980 s for biological modeling for example . in particular",
    ", coupling arguments have been proposed to study the longtime behavior of such processes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we argue on the fokker - planck equation and proceed differently .",
    "the argument we are using here to study the longtime behavior is purely deterministic in nature , and is based on a delay equation related to the fokker - planck equation  .",
    "we would like to mention that for more realistic models , a third phenomenon is typically at play , in addition to the stress induced by the ambient fluid , and to the relaxation to zero .",
    "all states of stress are not independent of one another , and they may also depend on the state of stress at neighboring points within the fluid .",
    "a certain redistribution of the stress therefore always occurs .",
    "this redistribution can be encoded in various ways , depending on some more detailed elements of modeling . in the so - called hbraud - lequeux model introduced in the seminal article  @xcite ( and",
    "then extensively studied mathematically in the works  @xcite ) , the redistribution is performed by a diffusion term in the stress space , at the given location  @xmath10 in the ambient physical space , and the complete equation thus writes @xmath29 where @xmath30 is some parameter . in an alternative model introduced by bocquet and coll . in  @xcite",
    ", the redistribution is achieved by some type of local `` convolution '' in the physical space .",
    "the equation ( we recall , set at the physical location  @xmath10 ) writes @xmath31 with a function @xmath32 related to the green function of some local stokes - type problem .",
    "the equation   which we study in the present article ignores the redistribution phenomenon , which amounts to taking @xmath33 in   or @xmath34 in . in the absence of such a simplification , we are unable to proceed with the main result of this article , which is the derivation of the macroscopic equation from our multiscale model .",
    "the well posedness result contained in our theorem  [ th : exu ] , on the other hand , also holds for   whith @xmath35 and has indeed been established some years ago in  @xcite . some more detailed comments on the modeling , as well as some formal foundations of the model based on a system of interacting particles",
    "are presented in  @xcite .",

    "section  [ sec : properties ] follows , establishing some useful properties of the solution . in order to understand the macroscopic equivalent of equation   for a given shear rate  @xmath36 , which we assume varies slowly as compared to the characteristic time of equation  , we need to understand the long - time behavior of the solution to  .",
    "we therefore study this behavior in sections  [ sec : tlc ] and  [ sec : long - time ] , respectively in the case of a constant shear rate  @xmath37 , and in the case of a slowly varying shear rate  @xmath38 .",
    "the results are stated in theorems  [ th : tlc ] and  [ th : tle ] .",
    "we are then in position to derive , in section  [ sec : passage ] , the macroscopic differential equations equivalent to   in this limit , namely system  .",
