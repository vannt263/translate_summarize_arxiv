    "since the pioneering works of barabasi and albert @xcite , _ `` complex networks '' _ have become a more and more active field , attracting physicists from the whole sub - fields of statistical physics , ranging from theoretical non - equilibrium statistical physics to experimental granular compaction .",
    "these complex structures are usually composed by large number of internal components ( the nodes ) , and describe a wide variety of systems of high technological and intellectual importance , examples including the internet @xcite , business relations between companies @xcite , ecological networks @xcite and airplane route networks @xcite . as a paradigm for large - scale social networks , people usually consider co - authorship networks @xcite , namely networks where nodes represent scientists , and where a link is drawn between them",
    "if they co - authored a common paper .",
    "their study has been very active recently , due to their complex social structure @xcite , to the ubiquity of their bipartite structure in complex systems @xcite @xcite , and to the large databases available ( arxiv and science index ) .    in this paper , we analyze data for such collaboration networks and focus on the development of neighbouring scientific disciplines in the course of time , thereby eyeing the spreading of new ideas in the science community .",
    "let us stress that the identification of the mechanisms responsible for knowledge diffusion and , possibly , scientific avalanches , is primordial in order to understand the scientific response to external political decisions , and to develop efficient policy recommendations . in section 2 , we concentrate empirically on this issue by studying data extracted from the arxiv database .",
    "to do so , we discriminate two sub - communities of physicists , those studying _ `` complex networks '' _ and those studying",
    "_ `` granular media''_. this choice is motivated by the relative closeness of these fields , that allows interactions between sub - communities ( inter - disciplinarity collaboration ) , and the passage of a scientist from one field to the other ( scientist mobility ) .",
    "the data analysis highlights that most contacts between the two disciplines are driven by inter - disciplinary collaborations , and reveals complex time - dependent properties . in section 3 ,",
    "we present a simple model based on the empirical observations .",
    "it is important to point that science spreading is usually modeled by master equations with auto - catalytic processes @xcite , or by epidemic models on static networks @xcite . in this article , however , we present a novel approach where the structure of the network itself evolves in an epidemic way .",

    "`` cond - mat''_. in the following , we assume that this simple semantic filter is sufficient to distinguish the collaborations between scientists . nonetheless , we recognize that the method does not ensure a perfect characterisation of the papers subject , e.g. some _ `` network papers '' _ may not focus on complex networks , such as _ the response function of a sphere in a viscoelastic two - fluid medium _ by levine and lubensky @xcite . in order to discriminate the authors and avoid spurious data",
    ", we checked the names and the first names of the authors .",
    "moreover , in order to avoid multiple ways for an author to cosign a paper , we also took into account the initial notation of the prenames .",
    "for instance , _ marcel ausloos _ and _ m. ausloos _ are the same person , while _ marcel ausloos _ and _ mike ausloos _ are considered to be different .",
    "let us stress that this method may lead to ambiguities if an initial refers to two different first names .",
    "nonetheless , we have verified that this case occurs only once in the data set ( hawoong , hyeong - chai and h. jeong ) , so that its effects are negligible .",

    ", width=336 ]    in order to build the co - authorship network , we apply the usual method @xcite , namely we consider a network of scientists placed at nodes , with a link between them if they co - authored a common paper . in order to discriminate the collaboration type between scientists ( fig.[little ] ) , we use different edge shapes , namely solid and dashed lines .",
    "moreover , we also discriminate scientists as _ `` granular '' _ , _ `` network '' _ or _ `` multi - disciplinary '' _ scientists , depending on their collaborations . by convention , if more than @xmath7 of their links are _ `` granular''_/_``network '' _ , the author is considered as _ `` granular''_/_``network '' _ , and is depicted by a circle / rectangle . else , the author is multi - disciplinary and is depicted by an ellipse . for a color - based version of the discrimination ,",

    "let us stress that the main island exhibits typical features of social networks , e.g. strongly connected scientists @xcite and modular structures @xcite . in order to study the interface between the two scientific fields , we have focused on the @xmath6 multi - disciplinary scientists @xmath9 in the system , each of them being characterized by @xmath10 and @xmath11 _",

    "in contrast , the total number of collaboration pairs @xmath14 that are related by * both * kinds of links is equal to @xmath15 , i.e. there are @xmath16 such links .",
    "this shows that most contacts between the two disciplines are driven by a change of the collaboration network ( fig.[mechanism ] ) , and not by a cooperative switch of the collaboration network .",
    "in other word , when a scientist works in two fields , he works in each field with different persons .",

    ", we consider overlapping time windows of 3 years , starting at july 1996 , that we move forward in time by small intervals of 1 month .",
    "this method ensures a smooth time evolution of the different variables .",
    "moreover , since now on , we characterize time windows by the date of the center value , e.g. we denote the interval [ 01/2002 ; 12/2004 ] by 07/2003 . in the following , we study in detail the properties of the main percolated island .",
    "the time evolution of the proportion of `` network '' links in this island exhibits remarkable features ( fig.4a ) .",
    "there are obviously two important dates in the evolution , one around november 2000 where the system shows a first order transition from a `` granular '' state to a `` network '' state , and one around may 2002 where strong perturbations develop in the system . in order to find the origin of these critical behaviours ,",
    "we have focused on the two largest connected islands in the system ( fig.4b ) .",
    "detailed analysis shows that the second largest island , centered around scientists like a.l .",
    "barabasi , grows faster than the largest island , that is more focused on granular media and encompasses scientists like h. j. herrmann .",
    "consequently , around november 2000 , there is switch between the first and the second island , associated to discontinuities in the quantities describing the main island .",
    "this is therefore a first order transition , in analogy with equilibrium statistical mechanics . around",
    "may 2002 , another critical phenomena takes place , namely the two main islands merge together , thereby increasing the proportion of `` granular '' links in the largest island .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in august 2002 , the two islands separate and recollide two months later",
    ". this bouncing and merging of the islands ( fig.5 ) is responsible for the fluctuations observed in ( fig.4a ) .",

    "in this last section , we introduce a very simple agent model , the collaboration - driven ising model ( cdim ) , that is based upon the above observations and is able to reproduce the self - organized emergence of phases in the system .",
    "to do so , we consider a stationary network , i.e. with constant number of scientists and of collaborations .",
    "there are 2 possible kinds of collaboration , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( _ `` granular''_/_``network '' _ ) , between two scientists ( no article written by 3 , 4 ... scientists ) .",
    "the main assumptions follow . on the one hand , we assume that the state of the nodes is characterized by their previous collaborations , e.g. a scientist with a majority of @xmath18 collaborations is a @xmath18 scientist .",
    "consequently , we neglect the influence of other internal variables ( no spin ) on the scientist future collaborations . on the other hand",
    ", we assume that scientists have a preference to work in their own field .",
    "practically , we consider a random network composed by @xmath20 nodes , and @xmath21 links .",
    "initially , the @xmath21 links are randomly distributed as @xmath18 and @xmath19 links . at each time step ,",
    "one link is removed and a new link is added between 2 randomly selected nodes , @xmath9 and @xmath22 .",
    "the kind of the added link , @xmath18 or @xmath19 , depends on the previous links of @xmath9 and of @xmath22 . to model this mechanism",
    ", we calculate the proportions of links @xmath18 for @xmath9 and for @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote respectively the number of links @xmath18 and the total number of links of the node @xmath9 .",
    "these quantities measure the ability of @xmath9/@xmath22 to work in the field a. we define the pair ability to be the average @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath29/@xmath30 , the selected pair should collaborate in the field @xmath18/@xmath19 .",
    "we implement this mechanism with the probabilities @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the selected pair to collaborate in @xmath18/@xmath19 . in these expressions , @xmath33 is a normalizing constant , @xmath34 plays the role of a temperature and characterizes the curiosity of scientists , i.e. their ability to work in new fields .",
    "@xmath35 is a drift term , that breaks the internal symmetry , and mimics the external effect of political decisions on the dynamics .",
    "simulations show that for high @xmath34 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 links are randomly distributed in the network . decreasing this parameter",
    ", structures develop in the system and lead to the emergence of separated phases for each scientific discipline , as those observed in figure [ mechanism ] .",
    "then , at some critical temperature @xmath36 , a symmetry breaking takes place , associated with the spontaneous supremacy of one of the scientific disciplines @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "the bifurcation diagram ( 1000 agents , 10 links / agent ) for the model without external field ( @xmath17 ) is plotted in figure 6a , and confirms the analogy with a ferromagnetic transition . in order to characterize the interface between the 2 coupled networks , we calculate the _ overlap coefficient _ , defined by @xmath37 , where the averages are performed over the nodes @xmath9 . by construction , @xmath38 if the links a and b are independently distributed .",
    "in contrast , @xmath39 indicates that few actors work in @xmath18 and @xmath19 simultaneously , i.e. the network is composed of well separated phases , where some scientists ensure exchanges between the scientific communities .",
    "the bifurcation diagram for the overlap coefficient ( fig.6b ) clearly shows that a decrease of @xmath34 is associated to a structuring of the network in separated phases . at the critical point @xmath36",
    ", a qualitative change takes place .",
    "finally , let us stress that cdim is analytically tractable in the mean field approximation .",
    "indeed , by assuming that detailed balance takes place for the stationary solution , and that the fluctuations of the number of links / node are negligible , study of the dynamics master equation @xcite show that @xmath40 , independently of the number of nodes and links of the network @xcite .",
    "we have verified by simulations that @xmath36 remains in the vicinity of @xmath41 , for a large number of parameters .",
    "moreover , deviations from the theoretical value @xmath42 decrease when fluctuations of the number of links / node decrease , as expected .",
    "inter - connections between distinct scientific disciplines play a central role in primordial phenomena , including the emergence of crises and trends in complex social networks , the diffusion of different topics in science and scientific avalanches , i.e. emergence of new research topics that rapidly attract large parts of the scientific community . in this paper , we focus empirically on this issue by studying data collected from the arxiv database , thereby highlighting the main mechanisms leading to multi - disciplinarity , as well as a rich and complex phenomenology .",
    "we also use the observations in order to build a simple stationary model for connected multidisciplinary scientists .",
    "qualitatively , its features are those of an ising model for magnetic systems , even though its dynamics is driven by the collaboration links , and not by spin attached to nodes .",
    "for instance , the effect of the parameter @xmath35 is very similar to that of an external magnetic field , and leads to hysteresis and metastability @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that this preliminary model ( cdim ) suffers limitations that avoid a quantitative comparison with the observed data .",
    "indeed , cdim does not incorporate mechanisms leading to power law degree distributions , and neglects many - author collaborations @xcite , social effects ( habits of authors to publish in close communities ) , non - stationary features , ... a generalization of cdim that accounts for these effects is under progress .",
