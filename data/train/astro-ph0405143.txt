    "two conspicuous aspects of gravitational lensing are the ability to ( i ) produce multiple images , and ( ii ) magnify the apparent brightness of a distant background source .",
    "large magnifications generally require that the projected density along the line of sight be of order the critical surface density for lensing , which in turn implies a precise alignment of the observer , the lens , and the source . the same condition generally leads to the production of multiple images , so in most cases one expects highly magnified objects to have at least one companion lensed image .",
    "the connection between magnification and multiple imaging can be important in a variety of contexts .",
    "an important example , which serves as the main motivation for this paper , is the recent discovery of bright quasars at redshifts as high as @xmath11 in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if these quasars are not lensed or beamed ( see @xcite and @xcite for arguments to justify both assumptions ) , they are inferred to be very luminous ( @xmath12 ) . assuming further that they shine at the eddington limit of their resident black holes ( bh )",
    ", these bhs must have masses of several @xmath13 .",
    "having such massive bhs at such an early stage in the evolution of the universe presents a challenge to models where massive bhs grow mainly by gas accretion that is itself eddington limited @xcite . even in the context of hierarchical structure formation models , where mergers of several bhs can contribute to the build - up of the mass ,",
    "the initial seeds are required to be present as early as @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the problem is exacerbated if bh ",
    "bh mergers result in the ejection of bhs from the shallow dark matter potential wells at high redshift because of a large recoil following the emission of gravitational waves . in a recent model that includes this effect , @xcite found that bhs can grow by mergers and accretion to at most a few @xmath15 by redshift @xmath16 without a super - eddington phase",
    " a short - fall by a factor of @xmath8 relative to the bh masses inferred from observations .    if the high - redshift quasars were magnified by gravitational lensing by a factor of @xmath17 , this could alleviate the need for a super - eddington growth phase to explain such massive early bhs ( since the inferred mass scales as @xmath18 under the assumption that the quasar is shining at the eddington luminosity ) .",
    "although the lensing optical depth along a random line of sight to @xmath11 is known to be small ( @xmath19 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , magnification bias can significantly boost the probability of strong lensing in a real , flux - limited survey .",
    "if the intrinsic ( unlensed ) quasar luminosity function at @xmath11 is steep , and/or it extends to faint magnitudes , the probability of strong lensing for the sdss quasars could even be of order unity @xcite .",
    "however , for a population of isothermal sphere lenses , all magnifications @xmath20 are associated with multiple imaging , and in most cases the angular separation between the images is more than @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "recent hst observations of the highest redshift quasars have shown no evidence for additional images of any of the @xmath5 sources down to a splitting angle of @xmath21 @xcite , which effectively rules out the hypothesis that the quasars are all highly magnified by _ isothermal sphere _",
    "lenses .",
    "the obvious question is whether the sdss quasars could be magnified by lenses with a more complicated ( and indeed more realistic ) lens potential , without producing multiple detectable images .",
    "@xcite showed that microlensing by stars within lens galaxies can permit magnifications as high as @xmath22 for singly - imaged quasars , but the probability for @xmath20 is still very low ( @xmath230.5% even when magnification bias is included ) .",
    "another question is whether departures from spherical symmetry significantly affect the results .",
    "one goal of this paper is to study ellipticity in the lens galaxy and tidal shear from objects along the line of sight , both of which are common in observed multiply - imaged systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ellipticity and shear are known to modify the full magnification distribution for multiply - imaged sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) ; but what happens when we restrict attention to sources without multiple detectable images is not known . more generally , our goal is to present a thorough and general study of the magnifications that can be produced by lenses with different radial profiles and angular shapes , without creating multiple detectable images .",
    "we simultaneously consider both true singly - imaged systems , as well as multiply - imaged configurations where the images are too close to be resolved or the extra images are below some reasonable detection threshold .    in this thorough but technical study ,",
    "let us not lose sight of the bottom line : we find that the _ maximum _ probability that a @xmath5 quasar is magnified by at least a factor of 10 without having a second detectable image is 29% ( see table  [ tab : frac ] ) .",
    "moreover , this maximum is reached only in the unlikely event that halos down to arbitrarily low mass have highly concentrated ( singular isothermal sphere ) profiles . in more realistic models of the lensing population , where dwarf halos have flatter ( nfw ) inner profiles ,",
    "the maximum probability is @xmath8% .",
    "while our analysis is specifically prompted by the sdss quasars , it should be applicable to other objects for which significant lensing amplification would be important , such as high - redshift galaxies discovered in `` blank '' fields .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   2 , we review the relevant lens theory and summarize our calculation methods . in the technical core of the paper (    3 - 4 )",
    ", we study the magnification properties of simple but useful lens potentials : ellipsoidal isothermal and nfw halos , with external tidal shear .",
    "the idea is to identify general features and understand the parameter dependences .",

    "we then pick @xmath44 random image positions in the circle .",
    "the cross section for producing a singly - imaged system with magnification greater than @xmath40 can be written as @xmath45 the first integral is over all source positions @xmath37 where there is only one image and it has magnification greater than @xmath40 .",
    "the second integral is over the corresponding image positions , and the equality holds because @xmath46 is the jacobian of the transformation between the image and source planes . in other words ,",
    "the cumulative singly - imaged magnification distribution can be computed by simply summing the images , weighted by their inverse magnifications .    for multiply - imaged sources",
    ", we find the smallest circle enclosing the caustics , then pick @xmath44 random sources in this circle and solve the lens equation to find the image configurations .",
    "now we throw away the singly - imaged systems , and use the multiply - imaged systems to compute the cross section for having a magnification greater than @xmath40 but no extra _ detectable _ images , @xmath47 this integral spans the multiply - imaged region , but the function @xmath48 selects source positions that produce lenses with only a single detectable image ; specifically , @xmath48 is 1 if the additional images are undetectable ( either because they are too faint , or too close to the brightest image ) , and 0 otherwise . in general , @xmath48 will depend on the specific source , instrument , and observational conditions .",
    "hereafter we refer to it as the `` single - detectable - image criterion '' ( sdic ) . in recent hst images of the @xmath5 sdss quasars , @xcite were able to rule out the presence of extra images with a flux ratio relative to the quasar of @xmath49 down to a separation @xmath50 , or brighter than @xmath51 down to @xmath52 .",

    "finally , as the ellipticity grows to @xmath98 the cusp of the tangential caustic pierces the radial caustic , so the high - magnification region just outside the cusp becomes associated with singly - imaged rather than multiply - imaged systems .",

    "large shears can in principle increase the cross section .",
    "however , it is not clear that massive nfw halos could experience such large shears .",

    "fortunately , this uncertainty is not important for our results because shear and ellipticity have such modest effects . for simplicity , in the rest of the paper we consider only spherical halos when computing multiply - imaged magnification distributions for nfw halos .",
    "having understood two fiducial halo models , we now combine them into a realistic population of galaxies and clusters .",
    "we compute the overall probability for magnification with additional detectable images , and use it to evaluate the hypothesis that the four @xmath5 sdss quasars are highly amplified by lensing . after defining the model (   [ sec : popmod ] ) , we present our general results (   [ sec : main ] ) and then apply them to the sdss quasars (   [ sec : sdss ] ) .",
    "we end with a discussion of some systematic effects in our analysis (   [ sec : systematics ] ) .",

    "the second integral is over the comoving halo mass function @xmath133 ; we adopt the theoretical mass function from @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath130 is the cross section computed above ( expressed in steradians ) , which depends on the source redshift @xmath134 , the lens redshift @xmath135 , the lens halo mass @xmath120 , and also on the lens model ( isothermal or nfw ) . by using the appropriate cross section",
    ", we can compute the probability for singly - imaged or multiply - imaged magnifications by any of the halo populations we have considered .",
    "implicit in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) is an average over appropriate ellipticity and shear distributions . for isothermal halos we use the results after averaging over ellipticity and shear , from   [ sec : iso - avg ] .",
    "since the results for nfw halos are not very sensitive to ellipticity and shear , we simply use a fixed ellipticity @xmath129 for the singly - imaged case ( in order to pick up the high - magnification tail ; see figure  [ fig : nfw ] ) , and we use spherical models for the multiply - imaged case .",
    "we consider a model with at least two different halo populations . the most massive halos , corresponding to clusters and groups of galaxies , are treated as nfw halos ; while halos corresponding to galaxies are modeled with isothermal profiles .",
    "in this increasingly standard model @xcite , the difference between clusters and galaxies is usually attributed to baryonic cooling : in massive halos the baryons have not had time to cool so the systems retain their initial nfw form ; while in lower - mass halos the gas has cooled and condensed into the center of the system , and created a more concentrated total ( baryons + dark matter ) mass profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , the transition between clusters and galaxies is characterized by a mass scale @xmath136 such that halos with @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) have a cooling time shorter ( longer ) than the age of the universe and correspond to galaxies ( clusters ) .",
    "= 6.2 in    there may be a third population as well , namely low - mass `` dwarf '' halos with nfw profiles .",
    "theoretical halo mass functions rise much more steeply than observed galaxy luminosity functions , leading to the speculation that there may be a substantial population of underluminous low - mass halos .",
    "mechanisms such as feedback or reionization might have suppressed baryonic cooling and star formation in low - mass systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the apparent dearth of small - separation lens systems implies a transition from isothermal galaxies back to nfw dwarfs around a mass of @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we summarize the model by introducing a function @xmath140 that describes the fraction of halos of mass @xmath120 that have isothermal profiles ( and the rest are nfw ) .",
    "we use the function : @xmath141 & $ m>{m_{\\rm clus}}$    } \\ ] ] to determine the parameter values , we follow @xcite and fit the model to the observed image separation distribution from the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . rather than @xmath142 .",
    "] the formal best - fit model has @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "however , there is a degeneracy between @xmath145 and @xmath136 such that a model with a sharp transition ( @xmath146 ) and @xmath147 fits almost as well .",
    "we have verified that the two models give indistinguishable results , so we report results only for the model with a sharp transition .",
    "the cluster / galaxy transition mass inferred from lensing agrees well with estimates based on cooling arguments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as for the galaxy / dwarf transition , current data lack any ability to determine whether it is smooth or sharp , so for simplicity we use only a sharp transition .",
    "the formal best - fit model has @xmath148 , although in fact only an upper limit on @xmath149 is reliable ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this mass is too high to be explained by reionization feedback , so it might indicate either some other kind of feedback or some peculiarities in the data ( perhaps unknown incompletenesses at small separations , or simply small - number statistics ) .",
    "we therefore consider several different values for @xmath149 .",
    "we take the transition masses @xmath136 and @xmath149 to be independent of redshift .",
    "this assumption may seem objectionable , but we show below that the specific value of @xmath136 has little effect on our results , and we explicitly consider systematic uncertainties associated with @xmath149 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pop1 ] shows the net singly - imaged magnification distribution , for our fiducial model . for sources at redshift @xmath150 ,",
    "magnifications of @xmath151 occur at the percent level , and the distribution drops quickly .",
    "the probabilities for @xmath152 are @xmath153 .",
    "in other words , significant singly - imaged magnifications are rare .",
    "there are nevertheless several qualitative results that are interesting and instructive .",
    "first , for @xmath107 the singly - imaged magnification probability is dominated by clusters .",
    "this result seems at first glance to contradict @xcite , who found that massive nfw halos had negligible impact on the probability for lensing magnification , but the apparent discrepancy is easily explained .",
    "@xcite considered lensing with undetected multiple imaging , while we are considering the complementary case where there is only a single image .",
    "nfw halos are much more efficient at producing highly magnified single images than multiple images ( see figure  [ fig : nfw2 ] ) , which is why we find a much stronger effect .",
    "the important implication of this result is that if there is a significant singly - imaged magnification ( @xmath154 ) then the lensing object is most likely a cluster , and ought to be relatively easy to detect .",
    "conversely , lensing with small to moderate singly - imaged magnifications ( @xmath155 ) is dominated by galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the claim by @xcite that one of the @xmath5 quasars is magnified by a factor @xmath156 by a foreground galaxy , with no obvious sign of a cluster .",
    "= 6.2 in    a second interesting feature of the singly - imaged magnification probability relates to the possible galaxy / dwarf transition at low masses . as discussed above , current lens data hint at the transition but do not constrain it well ,",
    "so we consider three possible cases : ( a ) a model with no transition ; ( b ) a model with the transition at @xmath157 ; and ( c ) a model with the transition at @xmath158 , which perhaps seems high but is formally the best fit to current data ( although it is not significantly better than the other models ) .",
    "models ( a ) and ( c ) are extremes that bound the range of reasonable possibilities , and model ( b ) is a sample intermediate model .",
    "not surprisingly , figure  [ fig : pop1 ] shows that moving the transition changes the relative contributions of galaxies and dwarf halos to the probability ; if the transition occurs at @xmath159 , dwarfs can conceivably contribute more of the probability than normal galaxies .",
    "but the important result is that changing @xmath149 affects the net probability by @xmath2310% , since the singly - imaged case is dominated by clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig : mult1 ] shows the multiply - imaged magnification probability , for different assumptions about the dwarf / galaxy transition and different single - detectable - image criteria ( sdic ) . in general , nearly all of the probability comes from galaxies .",
    "clusters contribute @xmath160 of the probability if we consider all image configurations , and @xmath161 if we consider those with only a single detectable image ; so we confirm the result from @xcite that clusters are essentially negligible for the multiply - imaged magnification probability .",
    "nfw dwarfs halos , if present in the model , likewise have a negligible contribution to the probability ( no more than @xmath162 even in the model with @xmath158 ) .",
    "the main effect of having dwarfs in the model is to reduce the number of halos that are isothermal galaxies , and hence to reduce the net multiply - imaged magnification probability",
    ". the reduction can be substantial when the sdics are important .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result from figure  [ fig : mult1 ] is the effects of the sdics .",
    "consider the probability of a magnification @xmath163 , and suppose we have no knowledge of the presence or absence of additional images .",
    "then we must use the multiply - imaged probability with no sdics , and add the singly - imaged probability , which yields total probabilities of @xmath164 for models ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) respectively . however , suppose like @xcite we can rule out the presence of extra images down to either @xmath165 and @xmath166 , or @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we should then use the lowest of the multiply - imaged curves in figure  [ fig : mult1 ] , and again add the singly - imaged probability . a useful way to quantify the results is to give the fraction of systems magnified by @xmath6 that do not have extra images detectable by @xcite .",
    "this fraction is given by the _ ratio _ of the probability with sdics to the probability without , or differences between the curves in figure  [ fig : mult1 ] ; the results are given in table  [ tab : frac ] .",
    "for example , in the no - dwarf model , about 24% of highly magnified systems are multiply - imaged such that the extra images are undetectable , and another 5% are singly - imaged . in models with dwarfs ,",
    "the fraction that are multiply - imaged without detectable extra images is much lower , so in total only 915% of highly magnified systems lack detectable extra images , and many of those are true singly - imaged systems lensed by clusters .",
    "lrrr no dwarfs & 0.049 & 0.241 & 0.290 + @xmath167 & 0.059 & 0.090 & 0.149 + @xmath168 & 0.080 & 0.014 & 0.094 + @xmath148 & 0.107 & 0.008 & 0.115 + [ tab : frac ]    = 6.2 in      so far we have only considered _ a priori _ lensing probabilities , i.e. , the bare optical depth for producing certain magnifications .",
    "however , to compute the probability of finding a certain magnification in a real , flux - limited survey we would also have to fold in magnification bias to obtain _ a posteriori _ probabilities . because the sdss can probe only the steep , bright end of the quasar luminosity function at @xmath5",
    ", magnification bias may be quite strong , but it is is extremely sensitive to the poorly - known lf shape .",
    "( in fact , the problem can be turned around so that lensing [ or lack thereof ] in the @xmath5 quasar sample yields constrains on the lf slope ; see @xcite and @xcite . ) rather than making detailed but highly lf - dependent predictions of the _ a posteriori _ probabilities , we turn attention to probability _ ratios _ and consider the following question : what is the ratio of the probability for @xmath6 with observational sdics , to the probability for @xmath6 without sdics ?",
    "this is equivalent to the question : in a toy model with magnification bias so strong that _ all _ @xmath169 quasars are magnified by a factor @xmath6 , what is the probability that one of the quasars would have no additional images detectable by @xcite ?",
    "in general , probability _ ratios _ should be the same for _ a priori _ and _ a posteriori _ probabilities , so table  [ tab : frac ] is exactly what we need . to summarize ,",
    "if we are extremely optimistic about having strong magnification bias and about all low - mass halos having steep isothermal profiles , we can imagine that the probability of a @xmath5 quasar being magnified by @xmath6 without having additional images detectable by hst might be as high as 29% .",
    "if this is the case , we can not rule out the possibility that one of the four @xmath5 quasars observed by @xcite might actually be significantly magnified .",
    "however , even then the probability that _ all four _ are amplified would be @xmath170 .",
    "the actual probability is almost certainly much lower , because magnification bias is probably not as strong as in the toy example , and because assuming that all low - mass halos have isothermal profiles probably overestimates the lensing optical depth . in other words",
    ", we can rule out at more than 99.3% confidence the hypothesis that all four @xmath5 quasars are amplified by more than a factor of 10  provided we can equate _ a priori _ and _ a posteriori _ probability ratios .",
    "the only possible problem with equating the probability ratios is if the sdss is somehow biased against high - redshift lensed quasars .",
    "suppose , for the sake of argument , that there were a total of @xmath171 lensed and highly magnified @xmath5 quasars in the sdss , 10 of which have not been identified .",
    "then having four quasars that are magnified but lack images detectable by @xcite would actually be consistent with the no - dwarf model . in our models with dwarfs",
    ", the total number of lensed quasars needed would be @xmath932545 ( see table  [ tab : frac ] ) .",
    "the key question is whether so many `` missing '' lensed high - redshift quasars could exist .",
    "the sdss @xmath172 quasar sample is selected on the basis of colors alone ; the sample is basically @xmath173-dropouts , with some additional color criteria to reduce contaminants @xcite .",
    "there is no requirement that the objects appear point - like in sdss images , and hence no bias against multiply - imaged systems .",
    "the only remaining problem is if light from a lens galaxy could change the composite colors of a lensed quasar system enough that the system would not be selected as an @xmath173-dropout .",
    "lens galaxies associated with @xmath5 lensed quasars would be expected to lie at redshifts @xmath174 ( see fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so would probably be too faint to significantly change the colors ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "while it would be interesting to quantify this effect more carefully , it seems unlikely that the sdss high - redshift quasar sample is highly biased against multiply - imaged systems .",
    "we have obtained our main result , namely answering the question of whether it is likely that the @xmath5 quasars are highly magnified , but there are several corollaries worth mentioning .",
    "first , so far in this section we have allowed the galaxies to have ellipticity and shear .",
    "( we have made certain assumptions about the ellipticity and shear for dwarf and cluster halos , but they are not so important ; see   [ sec : popmod ] . ) it is interesting to repeat the analysis with all halos assumed to be spherical , to see how much ellipticity and shear affect the results .",
    "figure  [ fig : mult - sph ] shows the results . in the no - dwarf model , neglecting ellipticity and shear reduces the probability of multiple imaging with @xmath6 by 3050% .",
    "the same holds in models with dwarfs for the total multiple imaging probability ( with no selection effects ) .",
    "however , in models with dwarfs where the sdics apply , the reduction is at least a factor of 5 and often much larger .",
    "this result can be understood as follows .",
    "most of the multiply - imaged magnification probability comes from the isothermal halos called `` galaxies '' in our model .",
    "if there are no dwarfs , then most of the probability comes from low - mass galaxies that produce image separations too small to be resolved ; so the flux ratio sdic is unimportant , and the probability is not dramatically sensitive to ellipticity ( see the upper curves in figure  [ fig : iso - dist2e ] ) .",
    "by contrast , if low - mass halos are dwarfs ( which have negligible cross sections ) , then much of the probability must come from galaxies that produce image separations larger than the resolution . in this case",
    "the flux ratio sdic plays an important role ; and in figure  [ fig : iso - dist2e ] we saw that this dramatically reduces the cross section when the ellipticity is zero .",
    "the bottom line is that ellipticity and shear are a factor of @xmath932 effect in no - dwarf models , but can be an order of magnitude effect in models with dwarfs .",
    "the second point is that there are several additional systematic uncertainties that might be relevant .",
    "we have considered three effects that have the most impact on strong lens statistics ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : ( i ) changing the halo mass function from that of @xcite to that of @xcite ; ( ii ) changing the scatter in the @xmath120-@xmath123 correlation for nfw halos from 0.14  dex to 0.07  dex or 0.21  dex ; and ( iii ) varying the location of the cluster / galaxy transition by @xmath175 .",
    "we find that changing the mass function has the strongest effect , and even that is only a @xmath9310% change in the net magnification probability .",
    "in other words , our results appear to be robust to effects other than the question of whether low - mass halos are isothermal galaxies or nfw dwarfs .",
    "= 3.1 in    finally , our discussion has been geared toward sources at @xmath2 , but for completeness in figure  [ fig : zsrc ] we show the net _ a priori _ magnification probability as a function of source redshift .",
    "we use the no - dwarf model as a way to obtain an upper bound on the probability ; for the multiply - imaged case we use the criteria @xmath176 or @xmath84 for detecting only a single image , although from figure  [ fig : mult1]a this choice is not so important . reducing the redshift naturally reduces the probability , especially for @xmath177 .",
    "it affects the whole distribution in the same way , so our general conclusions appear not to be highly sensitive to the source redshift .",
    "pushing quasar and galaxy samples beyond @xmath169 will not significantly increase the probability for large lensing magnifications .",
    "the problem of lensing magnification without multiple detectable images has a rich phenomenology .",
    "first , there is the case of true singly - imaged systems .",
    "isothermal halos are not very efficient at producing highly magnified single - image systems , but nfw halos are . consequently , high singly - imaged magnifications are possible in principle , and they are mainly associated with massive ( @xmath0 ) halos corresponding to clusters of galaxies .",
    "an important implication for observations is that , if there is no evidence for a cluster along the line of sight to a distant quasar , then it is unlikely that there is strong singly - imaged magnification .",
    "the second case is when there are multiple images but the extra images are not detectable , either because the image splitting is too small to be resolved , or because the extra images are too faint .",
    "nfw halos are inefficient at producing multiple images , and when they do they rarely produce extreme flux ratios ; therefore , clusters contribute negligibly to the multiply - imaged magnification probability . instead , this case is dominated by galaxies and lower - mass systems ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "the probability is very sensitive to the inner density profile of these halos .",
    "if all low - mass halos have steep isothermal profiles , then the probability is dominated by lens systems with image separations too small to be resolved by hst . however ,",
    "if low - mass dwarf halos have nfw profiles ( and hence small cross sections ) , then the overall probability is dominated by lens systems where the extra images are faint .",
    "our central quantitative result is that 929% of all lens systems with magnifications @xmath6 lack additional detectable images . in a toy model where magnification bias is so strong that most or all @xmath5 quasars are lensed , then we can not rule out the hypothesis that one of the four quasars observed by @xcite is magnified despite lacking extra images .",
    "however , even in such an extreme model , the probability that _ all four _ are magnified by a factor of 10 would still be no more than 0.7% , and is probably much lower .",
    "the only way to evade this argument is if the sdss high - redshift quasar sample is somehow biased against quasar lens systems with multiple bright images .",
    "that seems unlikely , although a detailed analysis of whether light from a lens galaxy could cause the @xmath173-dropout selection technique to miss a lens system is needed to answer this question definitively .",
    "incidentally , we can comment on the two different criteria used by @xcite to search for companion images to the @xmath5 quasars . @xcite",
    "were able to rule out extra images down to a flux ratio @xmath4 at image splittings greater than @xmath21 , or down to a less stringent flux ratio @xmath166 for smaller image splittings down to @xmath179 .",
    "we find that for the no - dwarf model , the two criteria give similar probability results .",
    "by contrast , for models with dwarfs , the criteria with more stringent flux bounds provide stronger constraints on the lensing probabilities . in other words , for the purpose of determining whether distant quasars are magnified by lensing , it is more valuable to aim for more dynamic range than to push for resolution much better than @xmath180 .",
    "to summarize , if the sdss high - redshift quasar sample is not highly biased against multiply - imaged quasars , then it is quite improbable that all four quasars observed by @xcite are highly magnified . in that case",
    ", the quasars can be taken as good evidence for the presence of billion-@xmath10 black holes in the young universe .",
    "explaining such black holes is a challenge for black hole growth models , whose solution may involve a need for super - eddington accretion @xcite .",
