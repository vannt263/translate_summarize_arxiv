    "recent analyses of solar photospheric abundance have shown a significant reduction of the abundances of c , n , o , and other heavy elements @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the ratio of the heavy - element abundance to hydrogen abundance , z / x , is reduced from 0.023 ( * ? ? ? * hereafter gs98 ) to 0.0171 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ags ) ( or 0.0177 @xcite ) ; and the surface z of the sun decreases from 0.017 to 0.0126 ( or 0.0133 ) .",
    "many solar models constructed in accord with this low z disagree with the seismically inferred sound speed and density profiles , convection zone ( cz ) depth , and helium abundance of the cz @xcite .",
    "* hereafter ba04 ) and @xcite found that the 15 - 20 per cent increase of opal opacities at the base of the cz can resolve the discrepancies between the solar models with low z and helioseismology .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite showed that the increase in the opacities is no more than 2.5 per cent near the base of the cz . @xcite and @xcite found that increasing neon abundance can solve the discrepancies .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite showed that the ratio of ne / o is consistent with the value given by ags .",
    "another attempt to resolve the problem focuses on increasing the rates of diffusion of helium and heavy elements .",
    "models with enhanced diffusion rates are in better agreement with helioseismology than the model without the enhanced diffusion . however , the sound speed and the density are still far from the seismic results , or the surface z / x value is still too high and the helium abundance of the cz is too low @xcite .",
    "using helioseismic data , @xcite determined that the solar metal abundance is 0.0172 @xmath1 0.002 .",
    "this is consistent with that of gs98 .",
    "@xcite found that both fe / h and o / h are more consistent with the values of gs98 than the values of ags .",
    "@xcite also found that the oxygen abundance is close to the value of gs98 .",
    "if these results are further confirmed , the problems induced by low z will disappear .",
    "however , @xcite argued that the ags results are trustworthy .",
    "recently , @xcite also found that the low carbon abundance is in good agreement with the findings based on entirely different indicators of ags and with the values determined by @xcite from lunar grains irradiated by solar wind .",
    "@xcite claimed that their results are more reliable than those of @xcite .",
    "the answer to the problems is still an open question .",
    "our aim is to construct a solar model , using recently determined abundances , which can agree with seismic constraints .",
    "we apply straight multipliers to the diffusion velocity to enhance the rates of element diffusion .",
    "although the theoretical error of gravitational settling rate is of the order of about 15 per cent @xcite , there are some significant uncertanties in the treatment of the element diffusion @xcite .",
    "our multipliers of the diffusion coefficients are very high , despite the fact that there is no obvious physical justification for such high multipliers , as has been pointed out by ba04 and @xcite .",
    "however , the multipliers are required in our models for diffusion to reduce the heavy - element abundance of the cz from the gs98 value to near the ags value . in order to get the same helium in a rotating model as in a non - rotating model , a multiplier of the element diffusion",
    "is required because rotational mixing reduces the degree of gravitational settling .",
    "other enhanced diffusion - rate models have been discussed by ba04 , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the main difference between our models and those of others is that we include rotational effects in order to resolve the low helium problem of the cz .",
    "we compare our results with those of ba04 and @xcite in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we use the yale rotation evolution code ( yrec7 ) to construct our solar models . however , we modify the code to include two tables of opal eos for the z diffusion ; and we correct an error in rotating model in the calculation of the chemical compositions .",
    "we use reconstructed opal opacities @xcite and new low - temperature opacities @xcite , both with the gs98 or ags mixtures . in principle , the eos table should also be reconstructed using ags mixtures , but it has been found that the effects of the change of heavy elements on the eos can be ignored @xcite .",
    "we therefore use the opal eos @xcite in all our models .",
    "element diffusion is included for helium and metals @xcite .",
    "energy transfer by convection is treated according to the standard mixing - length theory , and the boundaries of the convection zones are determined by the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "we take the solar age to be 4.57 gyr .",
    "luminosity @xmath2 = 3.8418@xmath3 erg / s , and radius @xmath4 = 6.9598@xmath5 cm .",
    "we construct the following six models : 1 ) m98 , a standard model with gs98 mixture opacities ; 2 ) m04 , a model with ags mixture opacities ; 3 ) m04d , same as m04 but enhancing the element diffusion @xcite ; 4 ) m04r1 , same as m04d but with rotation @xcite and diffusion coefficient @xcite added for shear instability ; 5 ) m04r2 and 6 ) m04r3 , both the same as m04r1 but with different diffusion multipliers , as shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "some of the parameters of the models are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the mixing - length parameter @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are free parameters adjusted to obtain the observed solar radius , luminosity and surface element abundances .",
    "finally , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the results of calculations at the age of 4.57 gyr .",
    "some of the calculation results are showed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the base of the cz is at 0.7335 @xmath4 for m04 and is 20 @xmath0 different from the seismically inferred 0.713 @xmath1 0.001 @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the surface helium abundance of 0.2294 is 6 @xmath0 away from the seismically inferred value 0.2485 @xmath1 0.0034 ( ba04 ) .",
    "the sound speed and density differences between m04 and the sun are shown in figure [ fig1 ] , where those of the sun were given by @xcite .",
    "m04 is in strong disagreement with the seismically inferred sound speed and density profiles , the depth of the cz , and envelope helium abundance .",
    "@xcite suggested that increased diffusion might be able to resolve these disagreements .",
    "thus , we construct the model m04d by multiplying the diffusion coefficients for helium and heavy elements by factors of 2.4 and 3.8 respectively .",
    "however , we have no physical justification for these multipliers .",
    "this method was firstly proposed by @xcite .",
    "the base of the cz of m04d is at 0.7168 @xmath4 , which agrees with the seismically inferred value @xcite at about the 3 @xmath0 level .",
    "the sound speed and density of m04d are better consistent with the seismic data than that of m04 .",
    "the difference of the sound speed and density between m04d and the sun , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , is less than 0.005 and 0.02 respectively .",
    "these values are close to those of the standard model m98 .",
    "in fact , the density profile of m04d is even slightly better than that of m98 . however , the surface helium abundance of 0.2225 is too low , which disagrees with the seismically inferred value 0.2485 ( ba04 ) at the level of 8 @xmath0 .",
    "the rotational mixing can reduce the degree of gravitational settling @xcite .",
    "we thus construct a rotating model , m04r1 , to study the low helium problem of m04d .",
    "the rotational mixing in all our models is treated as a diffusion process @xcite ; and the rotational mixing processes include eddington circulation , goldreich - schubert - fricke instability , and the secular shear instability @xcite . in all our rotating models ,",
    "the surface rotation rate is about 2.86@xmath15 rad / s at the age of 4.57 gyr .",
    "the sound speed and density differences between m04r1 and the sun are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "they are almost the same as those in m04d .",
    "the surface helium abundance of m04r1 is 0.2368 , which is 3 @xmath0 away from 0.2485 ( ba04 ) but agrees with that of @xcite .",
    "however , the base of the cz is at 0.7206 @xmath4 and disagrees with the seismically inferred value at about the 7 @xmath0 level .    in order to get a model which is more consistent with seismic constraints than m04r1",
    ", we relax the constraint of the heavy elements determined by ags and construct models m04r2 with z / x = 0.01976 and m04r3 with z / x = 0.0208 .",
    "the sound speed and density differences between m04r2 and the sun are less than 0.004 and 0.01 respectively ; and the surface helium abundance of m04r2 is 0.2454 within the constraint of observation ( ba04 ) . however , the depth of the cz in m04r2 disagrees with the seismically inferred value at about the 7 @xmath0 level .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 of m04r3 are less than 0.005 and 0.02 respectively .",
    "the surface helium abundance and the base position of the cz in m04r3 agree with the seismically inferred values at the levels of 1 @xmath0 and 3 @xmath0 respectively ; but the envelope z of 0.0154 is higher than the value of ags .",
    "this indicates that a model with high heavy elements is more consistent with seismic constraints than the model with ags heavy elements .    in the full1 m of ba04 , the differences @xmath13 and @xmath16 are larger than 0.01 and 0.05 respectively . in the @xcite models ,",
    "the @xmath13 is larger than 0.005 .",
    "we compare our results with these models in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "in this study , we assume that the diffusion coefficients for helium and heavy elements can be enhanced respectively . thus the discrepancies between the models with the low z and helioseismological theory can be reduced , but the helium abundance of the cz maintains too low in such models .",
    "in enhanced diffusion models , there is a gradient of element abundances caused by element settling at the base of the cz .",
    "the rotational secular shear is highly sensitive to the gradients of mean molecular weight @xcite , and the rotational mixing can smooth out the gradient of the element abundances .",
    "the settling of the helium abundance can thus be partly counteracted by the rotational mixing , and the surface helium abundance of the rotating model can thus be enhanced .    after relaxing the constraint of the z / x in model m04r3 , the sound - speed profile , density profile , depth of the cz , and surface helium abundance are almost the same as those in the standard model m98 ; but the surface z of 0.0154 is higher than the value of ags .",
    "the difference in the sound speed and density in our models can be improved by enhancing the diffusion coefficients for helium and heavy elements .",
    "thus , the maximum difference in sound speed decreases from 0.014 in m04 to 0.0045 in m04d and m04r1 .",
    "the density profiles of the enhanced diffusion models are even slightly better than that of m98 .",
    "the surface helium abundance of 0.2225 in model m04d is too low and is 8 @xmath0 different from that of ba04 .",
    "the surface helium abundance of the rotating model m04r1 is 0.2368 , which agrees with that of @xcite and @xcite ; but the position of the base of the cz in this model is 7 @xmath0 away from the seismically inferred position @xcite .",
    "the surface helium abundance and the base position of the cz in m04r3 are in agreement with seismic results at the levels of 1 @xmath0 and 3 @xmath0 respectively ; but the surface heavy - element abundance of 0.0154 is higher than the value of ags . some problems between the new element abundances and helioseismological theory can be solved individually , but it seems difficult to resolve them as a whole scenario .",
