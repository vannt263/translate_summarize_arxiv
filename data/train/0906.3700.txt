    "noncommutative elliptic theory is the theory of differential operators , whose coefficients form algebras , which are in general noncommutative .",

    "it is clear that the operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 do not commute . for such operators ,",
    "the ellipticity condition and index formula were obtained .",

    "namely , if a discrete group acts on a manifold , then one can consider operators of multiplication by functions and also operators of the group representation ( which are called shift operators , or operators of change of variables ) as coefficients of differential operators .",
    "this class of operators is known in the literature under various names : functional - differential operators , operators with shifts , nonlocal operators , noncommutative operators .",
    "we use the term `` noncommutative '' , because from our point of view it is most important in elliptic theory that the coefficients of these operators form noncommutative algebras .",
    "this class of operators includes operators of a.  connes as well as operators on toric manifolds as special cases .",
    "although finiteness theorem ( fredholm property ) for noncommutative differential equations was established relatively long ago  @xcite , the index problem , i.e. , the problem of expressing the index of a noncommutative elliptic operator in terms of its symbol , was open for a long time . in 2008",
    "this problem was solved in  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to apply this index formula to operators , which appear in geometry , and compute indices of some specific operators .",
    "let us briefly describe the contents of the paper .",
    "in the first part of the paper ( sections 1 - 3 ) we review elliptic theory for noncommutative differential operators : definition of operators , formula for the symbol , finiteness theorem , construction of chern character of elliptic symbol , index theorem .",
    "the proofs of all these results were published in  @xcite , except theorem  [ th - e ] , which is new .",
    "then in sections 4 and 5 we obtain index formulas for classical geometric operators : euler , signature , dirac operators . in section 6 , we compute the index of operators on the circle , while section  7 deals with the index of operators of a.  connes on the noncommutative torus .",
    "the results of this paper were presented at international conferences `` @xmath7-algebras and elliptic theory iii '' in banach center ( poland ) , january 26 - 31 , 2009 and `` @xmath8-theory , @xmath7-algebras and topology of manifolds '' in chern institute of mathematics ( china ) , june 1 - 5 , 2009 .",
