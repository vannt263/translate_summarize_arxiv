    "blazars constitute a class of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) consisting of bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) . in the unified schemes of agns ,",
    "blazars are believed to be the beamed counterparts of the fr i / fr ii radio galaxies and many of their properties can be well understood in such a scenario ( e.g. browne 1983 ; antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) . according to orientation based unification scheme for radio - loud agns , blazar s jet make angles @xmath4 20@xmath5 or so to the line of sight ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "significant flux variations in the whole range of electromagnetic spectrum on time scale of less than a day to several years are common in blazars .",
    "their radiation at all wavelengths is predominantly non thermal and strongly polarized ( @xmath6 ) in radio to optical bands .",
    "blazar variability can be broadly divided into 3 classes viz . micro variability or intra - night variability or intra - day variability , short term outbursts and long term trends .",
    "variations in flux of a few tenth of a magnitude in a time scale of tens of minutes to a few hours ( less than a days ) is often known as intra - day variability ( idv ) ( wagner & witzel 1995 ) .",
    "short term outbursts can range from weeks to months and long term trends can have time scales of months to several years .",
    "study of optical and near - ir variability of blazars on diverse time scales was carried out by several groups ( miller & mcgimsey 1978 ; xie et al .",
    "1988 ; webb et al . 1988",
    "; kidger & de diego 1990 ; carini 1990 ; carini et al . 1992 ; heidt & wagner 1996 ; bai et al .",

    "; stalin et al . 2005 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the first convincing evidence of optical idv was found in bl lacertae by miller et al .",
    "the typical optical idv found in most of the blazars is @xmath1 0.01 mag hr@xmath7 .",
    "carini ( 1990 ) observed a sample of 20 blazars and found most of them showing detectable inter - night variations .",
    "he also noted that in observing runs of more than 8 hours , the probability of detecting significant idv was @xmath1 80% .",
    "subsequently , heidt & wagner ( 1996 ) observed a sample of 34 radio selected bl lacs and detected idv in 28 ( i.e. 82% ) sources out of which 75% sources showed significant variation with in @xmath8 6 hours which further supports the finding of high frequency of occurrence of idv in blazars . in our recent paper ( gupta & joshi , 2005 ) , we studied the frequency of occurrence of optical idv in different classes of agns and found about 10% ( 18/174 ) radio - quiet agns , 35@xmath040% ( 41/115 ) radio - loud agns ( excluding blazars ) and 70% ( 79/113 ) blazars to show idv ( in fact @xmath1 80@xmath085% blazars show idv , if observed for more than 6 hours ) .",
    "mrk 501 is one of the most interesting and nearby bl lac object at z = 0.034 which makes it the second closest known bl lac object after mrk 421 ( z = 0.031 ) .",
    "mrk 501 has been studied for variability in all regions of the electromagnetic spectrum ( e.g. fan & lin 1999 , kataoka et al .",
    "1999 , sambruna et al .",
    "2000 , ghosh et al .",
    "2000 , xue & cui 2005 , gliozzi , et al . 2006 , and references therein ) . in optical region",
    "this source has been studied by several groups e.g stickel et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have reported variation of 1.3 magnitude in luminosity ; heidt & wagner ( 1996 ) have reported @xmath1 32% variation in flux in less than two weeks time ; ghosh et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have made 10 nights observations on mrk 501 during march to june , 1997 to search for rapid variability and reported rapid variability in 7 nights ; and recently , fan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) observed mrk 501 for two hours in one night in october 2000 and found no significant variation .",
    "the variability in blazars is mainly attributed to either due to the disc instability or the activity in the jet .",
    "idv reported in the flaring and high state is generally attributed to the shock moving down the inhomogeneous medium in the jet .",
    "but small amplitude variation in the low state of blazar could be due to instability in the accretion disk ( witta et al .",
    "1991 , 1992 ; chakrabarti & wiita 1993 ; mangalam & wiita 1993 ) .",
    "recently , it is noticed that , in the low luminosity agns , accretion disk is radiatively inefficient ( chiaberge et al .",
    "2006 ; chiaberge & macchetto 2006 ; macchetto & chiaberge 2007 ; capetti et al .",
    "so , there will be an alternative way to explain the idv in the low - state of blazars , in which a weak jet emission will be responsible for the idv .",
    "so far there is no clear answer to this .",
    "there is a need to study idv and short term variability in the optical bands with a good sampling in time when the source is in low state . in view of this",
    "we pursued the present study to address both the idv and short term variability on mrk 501 .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section 2 describes photometric observations and data reductions , section 3 present the results , and discussions and conclusions are presented in section 4 .",

    "for flat field correction , twilight flats and bias frames were taken every night .",
    "for each night median bias and median flat frames were constructed which were used in image processing .",
    "image processing ( bias subtraction , flat - fielding and cosmic rays removal ) , photometric reduction ( getting instrumental magnitude of stars and mrk 501 ) and calibration were done at physical research laboratory , ahmedabad , india .",
    "image processing was done using standard routines in the iraf package .",
    "star no . 1 , 4 and 6 ( see villata et al . ,",

    "4 and 6 were having poor s / n ratio compared to mrk 501 .",
    "there is advantage , sky variation ( seeing ) and cloud effects are effectively eliminated by instrumental magnitude of mrk 501 and standard stars in the field of mrk 501 were determined with the help of daophot ii package ( stetson 1987 , 1992 ) using concentric aperture photometric technique taking apertures of radii 5.0 , 7.0 , 9.5 and 12.0 pixels .",
    "the data reduced with different aperture radii were found in good agreement .",

    "the internal photometric errors of brightness for each passband are estimated using artificial addstar experiment as described by stetson ( 1987 ) .",
    "we found the standard deviation ( @xmath10 ) = 0.015 , 0.012 and 0.010 for b , v and r passbands respectively .",

    "only the data for those nights are taken where the data points are more than seven .",
    "we report here objectively the presence or absence of idv at a confidence level of more than 5@xmath10 .",
    "* b passband : * the source has been observed in b passband on 3 nights but there are only a few data points ( three ) in each night and hence the data are not plotted .",
    "measurements in b passband show variation to the extent of 0.013 mag on march 8 , 0.080 mag on march 9 and 0.015 mag on march 10 .",
    "looking at the data of march 9 , we notice fluctuations in brightness of comparison star , which might be partly responsible for the apparent variation of 0.015 mag seen in mrk 501 , so the variation detected is doubtful .",
    "hence as per our criterion , there is no significant idv seen in b band data .",
    "* v passband : * light curves in v passband show variation to the extent of 0.079 mag on march 30 ( fig",
    ". 1 ( a ) ) .",
    "visual inspection of the figure indicates that the the variation seen in mrk 501 might be due to the fluctuations in comparison star .",
    "so , the variation seen may not be a genuine idv .",
    "variations are also noticed on other nights : 0.019 mag on march 31 , 0.026 mag on may 1 , 0.035 mag on may 2 and 0.034 mag on may 3 .",
    "however , as per our idv detection criterion , we conclude no detection of significant idv during the observing run of 5 nights .",
    "* r passband : * light curves in r passbands show variation to the extent of 0.004 mag on march 8 , 0.027 mag on march 9 , 0.009 mag on march 10 , 0.022 mag on march 30 , 0.029 mag on march 31 , 0.147 mag on april 1 , 0.053 mag on april 5 , 0.018 mag on april 6 , 0.021 mag on may 1 , 0.077 mag on may 2 and 0.039 mag on may 3 .",
    "the data on april 1 are noisy , therefore the variation of 0.147 mag seen in this night is not taken as genuine idv .",
    "visual inspection of light curve on may 2 shows fluctuations in the magnitude of comparison star and hence the apparent variation seen in mrk 501 might be partly due to this .",
    "therefore , the variation seen is not considered as real .",
    "so , out of 11 nights observations in r passband , idv is seen only in 1 night , i.e april 5 .    variations , similar to that seen in the present work , have also been noted earlier by other researchers e.g. on one occasion ghosh et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have reported variation of 0.13 mag in v band in less than 30 min while on the other occasion they report brightness variation of 0.04 mag in 29 minutes followed by steady brightness . according to ghosh et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the source was not in active phase during their observing run .",
    "fan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have reported the results on mrk 501 based on the continuous observing run of two hours in october 2000 in r band and no significant variations were noticed . a blazar generally show idv of relatively large amplitude during its outburst period while it shows very small flux variation or no obvious variation during the quiescent state .",
    "thus during our observing run , mrk 501 appears to be in quiescent state as the intraday brightness variations detected are less than 6 to 7% .      in fig .",
    "4 we have plotted all the data points in b , v and r passbands against the time in jd .",
    "the inter - night brightness variations are distinctly visible in the figure ; the maximum variation of the source in v passband being 0.19 mag ( between its faintest level at 13.78 mag on jd 2451635.320 and the brightest level at 13.59 mag on jd 2451667.237 ) whereas in r passband it has varied by 0.29 mag ( between its faintest level at 13.46 mag on jd 2451613.505 and the brightest level at 13.17 mag on jd 2451667.194 ) .",
    "data of april 1 being noisy , are not included in the short term variability analysis . during the observing run of about 8 weeks",
    ", the source shows brightness variation of about @xmath1 15 % in v passband and @xmath1 25 % in r passband .",
    "heidt & wagner ( 1996 ) have reported @xmath1 32% variation in flux in less than two weeks time which is larger than the variation seen in the present work ( the maximum brightness variation detected in the present work is about 25% in about 2 months time ) .      in fig .",
    "4 panel ( d ) and ( e ) , nightly average color ( b@xmath11 @xmath0 r@xmath11 ) and ( v@xmath11 @xmath0 r@xmath11 ) respectively are plotted against the time ( in jd ) . for plotting purpose instead of taking the mean time ( in jd ) of the observing run",
    ", we have taken jd at 00h 00 m 00s ut of that specific date . in fig .",
    "2 , panel ( d ) , there is no significant change in ( b@xmath11 - r@xmath11 ) color but in panel ( e ) the variation in color ( v@xmath11 @xmath0 r@xmath11 ) is apparent .",
    "the effect of variation in v and r magnitude ( see panel ( c ) and ( d ) ) has reflected in the ( v@xmath11 - r@xmath11 ) color showing , the source has become 0.19 mag bluer during the observing campaign ( between 0.53 at jd 2451635.50 and 0.33 at jd 2451669.50 ) .",
    "2 , panel ( g ) shows the light curve of mrk 501 in r - band on april 5 , 2000 . during the period jd 2451640.412 to jd 2451640.421 ,",
    "the luminosity has decreased by 0.04 mag and then a rapid flare has occurred at epoch jd 2451640.421 , reaching a brightness excursion of 0.05 mag at jd 2451640.431 . just after the flare , again there is a decrease in luminosity of 0.02 mag between jd 2451640.431 and jd 2451640.438 . there",
    "after the source became steady ( see fig 2 ( g ) top panel ) .",
    "to search for the time scale of variation quantitatively , we carried out structure function ( sf ) analysis on the r - band idv of fig .",
    "2 ( g ) ( top panel ) .",
    "sf is usually calculated twice by using an interpolation algorithm , first starting from the beginning of the time series and proceeding forward and then starting from the end and proceeding backward",
    ". this will give two slightly different sf curves but will provide a rough assessment of the errors due to the interpolation process ( wu et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the first order structure function is equivalent to the power spectrum density ( psd ) and is a powerful tool to search for periodicities and time scales in a time series data ( see e.g. rutman 1978 ; simonetti , cordes & heeschen 1985 ; paltani et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the first order sf for a light curve having uniformly spaced data points is defined as @xmath12^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where k is time lag , @xmath13 and the weighting factor w(i ) is 1 if a measurement exists for the ith interval , 0 otherwise .",
    "the squared uncertainties in the estimated sf is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the measured noise variance .",
    "since the data sampling in our light curve is quasi - uniform , we used interpolation method to determine the first order sf . for any time lag k , the value of a(i+k )",
    "was calculated by linear interpolation between the two adjacent data points . in a similar fashion sf",
    "was calculated for a large number of idv light curves ( sagar et al .",
    "2004 , stalin et al .",
    "the behavior of the first order sf have the following types :    \\(i ) if the source first order sf does not display any plateau , it represents the time scale of the variability to be larger than the length of the data .",
    "\\(ii ) if the source first order sf display a plateau followed by a dip in the sf , the dip indicates a possible cycle and plateau the time scale of the variability .",
    "3 displays the sf of the light curve of top panel of fig 2 .",
    "sf display one plateau followed by a dip . from the plateau",
    "we deduce the variability time scales to be 0.01 day i.e @xmath1 15 min .",
    "from our observations on mrk 501 during march - may , 2000 , we find the existence of idv ( to the extent of @xmath1 6 - 7 % ) in r band on one occasion .",
    "the source has shown short term flux variability and total variation detected in our observations in v passband is @xmath1 15 % and in r passband is @xmath1 25 % .",
    "the data do not show any significant variation in ( b@xmath0r ) color but ( v@xmath0r ) color has varied by about 0.2 mag . though we see some variation in brightness in the light curves , it appears that mrk 501 was not in active phase during our observations .",
    "we have detected variation , on april 5 , in time scale of @xmath1 15 min in mrk 501 .",
    "our observations do not show any periodicity or quasi - periodicity in intra - day or short time scales .",
    "but , in some other blazars quasi periodic variations have been reported earlier on longer as well as shorter time scales e.g. quasi periodic variations , existing simultaneously in optical and radio wavelength , are reported on the timescale of 1 to 7 days in s5 0716 + 714 ( quirrenbach et al .",
    "the same source on other occasion shows quasi periodic variation in time scale of 4 days in optical region ( heidt & wagner 1996 ) .",
    "quasi periodic variations were also found in the pks 2155 - 304 in uv and x - ray wavelength ( urry et al .",
    "1993 ) . on short time scale , for example , periodic flux variation is reported in oj 287 in radio as well as in optical band .",
    "valtaoja et al .",
    "( 1985 ) have reported 15.7 min periodicity at 37 ghz , carrasco et al .",
    "( 1985 ) have reported 23 minute period in their observations in optical b passband and carini et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have shown the optical periodicity of 32 min .",
    "several models have been developed to explain the idv and short term variability in blazars viz .",
    "the shock - in - jet models , accretion - disk based models ( e.g. wagner & witzel 1995 ; urry & padovani 1995 ; ulrich , maraschi & urry 1997 and references therein ) . the detection of quasi - periodicity in time scale of minutes to less than a week in some of the blazars could be taken as evidence for the existence of accretion disk pulsation , or the presence of a single dominating hot - spot on the accretion disk , or of a helical structure in a jet ( vila 1979 , mangalam & wiita 1993 , chakrabarti & wiita 1993 ) .",
    "quasi - periodic variation may also be attributed to a precessing jet .",
    "so search for periodic variations has great interests .",
    "the variability reported in the present work could be explained by any of the above models .",
    "however , the variability detected in the low state of blazars can be explained on the basis of some kind of instability in the accretion disk , because in the low state , jet emission is less dominant over the thermal emission from the disk . within unified schemes ,",
    "the blazars are seen nearly face on , hence any accretion disk fluctuations should be directly visible",
    ". the models for the flares randomly emerging at different locations and at different time on accretion disks could be very relevant to the variations seen in blazars at low - state .",
    "eclipse of the hot spot by parts of the disk between the individual spot and the observer could be the other possible mechanism to produce variability in blazars at low - state .",
    "there often exists a range of azimuthal positions at a given radius within which the spot is eclipsed , and this is directly depends on the geometry of disk and the viewing angle of observer .",
    "the central black hole mass is expected to shed some light on the evolution process in agns ( barth et al .",
    "2002 , fan 2003 ) .",
    "there are several ways to find the bh mass but there is no consensus on this and the bh mass reported in the literature for a particular source differ significantly .",
    "the bh mass for mrk 501 , estimated by many authors , is in the range ( 0.01 @xmath0 3.4 ) @xmath2 10@xmath16 m@xmath17 ( barth et al .",
    "2002 , fan et al . 1999 , merritt & ferrarese 2001 , rieger & mannheim 2003 ) . for mrk 501 ,",
    "our optical observation show the variability time scale of 15 min .",
    "we assume that detected idv is due to an instability in the vicinity of the super massive bh and the size of emitting region is taken as r @xmath18 ct , where t is the variability time scale ( i.e 15min ) . further assuming that the 15 min variability time scale corresponds to instability or disk pulsation on the accretion disk at a distance of r = 5 r@xmath19 where r@xmath202gm / c@xmath9 is schwarschild radius , the mass of the super massive bh , m can be estimated by using the formula : m = c@xmath21t/10 g = 1.20 @xmath2 10@xmath22 m@xmath17 .",
    "the eddington luminosity for a black hole of mass m is given by l@xmath23 1.3 @xmath2 10@xmath24 ( m / m@xmath17 ) erg s@xmath7 ( witta 1985 ) , which in the present case will be l@xmath23 1.56 @xmath2 10@xmath25 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "the result is in the range of ( 0.01 @xmath0 3.4 ) @xmath26 , and hence consistent with other results .",
    "there is an alternative way to explain the idv detected in the present work . in the recent work ( e.g. chiaberge et al .",
    "1999 , 2006 ; chiaberge & macchetto 2007 ; capetti et al .",
    "2007 ; macchetto & chiaberge 2007 and references therein ) , by analyzing r band hst images of a sample of 33 fr i sources , they were able to detect the unresolved optical nuclear sources .",
    "they found that optical and radio nuclear luminosities were strongly correlated .",
    "they also found tight correlation between the radio and x - ray luminosities measured from chandra observations ( balmaverde et al .",
    "furthermore , the correlation between radio , optical and x - ray emission extends to the large population of radio - loud agns found in early - type galaxies , with luminosities smaller by a factor @xmath1 1000 with respect to classical low - luminosity radio - galaxies ( balmaverde & capetti 2006 ) . according to these findings the nuclear emission in low luminosity radio - loud agns",
    "is dominated by non - thermal emission from the base of the jet . assuming fr i and bl lacs unification , which is yet to be established",
    ", the alternate possibility is that the idv seen in bl lacs could arise in the jet . considering this model ,",
    "the detected small idv in the low - state of the bl lac object mrk 501 might be due to a weak emission from the base of the jet",
    ".    it will be really interesting to start a long term multi - color optical monitoring program of bl lac objects in their low - states to search for the idv .",
    "we believe , with focused effort , we can make a large data set , and we may be able to find which model is more appropriate to discuss the results of idv in the low - state of bl lac objects . at this stage , we leave it as an open problem .",
