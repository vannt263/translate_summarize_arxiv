    "loft @xcite is devoted to study matter in extreme states such as those found at the event horizon of black holes or the surface of neutron stars .",
    "these sources exhibit rapid luminosity changes and spectral variability in the x - ray region , providing the key scientific justification for the large area detector ( lad ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) one of the two core scientific instruments proposed for loft .",
    "the lad is a collimated detector based on silicon drift detectors ( sdd ) that work in the energy range 2 - 50 kev with an effective area of approximately 10 m@xmath0 at 8 kev , an energy resolution of 4% at 6 kev and a timing accuracy of 10 @xmath1s .",
    "+ the lad detector consists of 2016 sdds located in six deployable panels ( see fig .  [ satellite ] ) and organized as shown in fig .  [ module ] in modules of 16 elements mechanically and electrically linked to form a single coherent instrument .",
    "the sdd version adopted for lad is an optimization of the model used in alice , an experiment of the large hadron collider at cern @xcite .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) is limited by a collimator placed in front of the detector , in order to reduce the background contamination from off - axis point sources and the diffuse cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) .",
    "its design requires a trade - off as introducing a collimator drastically reduces background from off - axis sources , but produces a varying instrument response with off - axis angle .",
    "hence , care is required to avoid spurious modulations in the detected signals caused by the limitations of the precision of spacecraft attitude control and by pointing stability ( @xmath21@xmath3 for the lad ) .",
    "+ following the heritage of the exosat instruments meda @xcite and gspc @xcite and , more recently , the collimator on the bepicolombo mercury imaging x - ray spectrometer ( mixs - c ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the technology adopted for the lad is based on lead - glass microchannel plates ( mcp ) .",
    "this type of collimator provides a transmission function that is suitable for the scientific objectives of loft mission , while minimizing the mass per unit area - as required by the large surface area that most be covered for loft ( active area @xmath215 m@xmath0 ) .",
    "an effect of primary importance for lad performances is that x - ray photons with small grazing incident angles ( lower than a few degrees ) can be reflected by the inner walls of the pores in lead glass collimators according to the total reflection theory @xcite .",
    "this effect increases the collimator transmission at off - axis angles , rounding or flattening the transmission profile , but also enhancing the background contribution from cxb and field sources - degrading instrument sensitivity .    in this paper",
    ", we present an ad - hoc study to evaluate the influence of channel reflectivity on the instrument performance .",
    "section [ collimator ] presents details of the collimator chosen in the lad baseline design .",
    "section [ sect - refl ] presents a limited experimental measurement of a prototype collimator , used to constrain the reflectivity model reported in section [ code ] .",
    "section [ sims ] presents the results of a simulator for the instrument s response ( including the transmission function of the collimator and the level of detected cxb ) and section [ summary ] describes the conclusions of our study .",
    "the collimator adopted for the lad is summarized in table  [ tabcoll ] and comprises an array of 8@xmath411 cm mcps which are held @xmath22 mm above the sdd input face by a titanium frame .",
    "sixteen sdds and collimators are held in an al detector housing which constitutes a module ( fig .  [ module ] ) .",
    "mcps are made by a draw and etch process similar to how optical fibres are produced @xcite .",
    "a lead - glass core , is surrounded by a cladding glass , forming a couple which is drawn and stacked to produce a multi - fibre .",
    "these are then stacked and fused to produce a block , which which can be sliced , polished to the required thickness and etched to produce the finished plates .",
    "the wall of the pores are therefore made of the cladding glass , with a density of 3.3 gm @xmath5 and pb fraction ( @xmath237% by weight ) guaranteeing good absorption of x - rays in the pore septa in the 2 - 30 kev energy band of lad .",
    "this configuration gives an open area ratio of @xmath270% , an aspect ratio of 60:1 and a geometrical fov of @xmath21@xmath6 .",
    "the transmission function presents a moderate dependence on the azimuthal angle @xmath7 ( relative to the axes defined by the cartesian pore walls ) because of the square shape of the pore . in particular , moving from @xmath7=0@xmath6 to @xmath7=45@xmath6 , the geometrical collimator transmission is reduced by @xmath24% at 5@xmath3 and by @xmath215% at 15@xmath3 .",
    "a blanket of 80 nm al supported by 1 @xmath1 m kapton , placed either above or below the mcps , shields lad against uv , optical , and infrared light contamination .",
    "moreover a second al film , 80 nm thick , is deposited on top to thermally insulate the collimator and provide a second layer of light rejection .",
    "this second layer offers added resilience against light ingress through pinholes in the foils .",
    "the collimator transmission function is influenced by misalignments coming from a number of sources as mounting tolerances between the optical axis and the deployable panels , or between the separate collimators or modules .",
    "the pore - to - pore alignment in the mcp itself is not negligible .",
    "moreover , time variable effects exist , such as those induced by thermal deformations of panels and modules during the different thermal loading around an orbit . + to maintain lad performances within the requirements derived from the proposed scientific objectives , the total misalignment error budget must be of order 2.5@xmath3 where the contribution from pore orthogonality is @xmath21@xmath3 .",
    "the polishing of the couple prior to drawing and the drawing process itself lead to pore surfaces that are intrinsically smooth .",
    "subsequent removal of the core glass by acid etch @xcite produces a silicon - rich layer in the inner surface of the pores where lead and other elements have been leached out @xcite .",
    "moreover , a roughening of the inner pore surface may occur , whose level depends on several factors , including the etching uniformity , irregularity of the core glass surface or diffusion effects across the glass boundaries @xcite .",

    "an electron bombardment source with a molybdenum anode was used to stimulate the mo - l fluorescence lines with an average energy of @xmath22.4 kev .",
    "an accelerating potential of 4kev and a 1 @xmath1 m ag filter were used to isolate the region of the emission lines and maximise the line to continuum ratio .",
    "+ the collimator was held in a two axis rotation stage , a distance of 27 m from the x - ray source in order to minimise the effect of beam divergence .",
    "a large area mcp detector @xcite was placed behind the collimator to measure changes in the intensity of the radiation passing through the collimator as a function of off - axis angle .",
    "the measurements were performed by rotating the collimator incrementally by steps of 5@xmath3 .",
    "the ratio between the detector count rate at each angle and the on - axis value are shown in table  [ lab_data ] .",
    "the errors in the count rate are dominated by the dark noise of the detector , where radioactive isotopes in the detector glass lead to a non - zero background .",
    "the errors reported in the table reflect this , of paramount importance here is the ratio of the input count rate and the detector noise over the relevant area of the detector .",
    "although the source generates a large emission rate for x - rays , the solid angle subtended by the collimator at 27 m is small , making it difficult to improve the signal to noise significantly without compromising on beam divergence .",
    "the experimentally obtained transmission function includes several effects which can not be deconvolved easily during data analysis , including : beam divergence , mcp pore misalignment and pore wall reflectivity .",
    "a ray - tracing simulator allows a mathematical approach to deducing the major contributors to the transmission function , by computing a transmission function for comparison with the empirical data .",
    "+ the simulator is a stand - alone ray - tracing code which models the interactions of x - ray photons with the collimator and follows them to the detector surface .",
    "the photon interaction processes , in all stages , are governed by montecarlo calculations . the flow chart of the code is presented in fig .  [ raytr ] .",
    "the collimator is defined as a solid parallelogram with a porous structure , where each pore is described as an empty parallelogram identified by the coordinates of its centre and by the width of the sides .",
    "both filters are simulated directly in front of the collimator .",
    "mcp pore misalignments are taken into account by varying the photon incident direction by an angle randomized from a gaussian distribution whose standard deviation is given as an input parameter .",
    "+ source photons can either be simulated with monochromatic energy or drawn from spectral distributions introduced as tables , the nature of the source can be either point - like or diffuse and it may be located at either finite or infinite distance from the collimator .",
    "the modelled detection surface has the same geometrical area as the collimator and no detector response is included .",
    "each photon is characterised by a direction , an energy and an impact position randomly distributed on the collimator surface . if not absorbed by the filters , photons can be either directly transmitted to the focal plane or interact with the collimator . in the latter case",
    ", they can either be absorbed by the structure or interact with the pore wall : multiple interactions within a pore can happen before the photon is absorbed or reach the detection surface . if a photon is reflected , its output direction is computed from snell law .",
    "the filter transmission depends on energy and incident angle and is computed evaluating the thickness crossed by the photon and interpolating the cross - sections of the involved materials from tables retrieved from the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) database .",
    "figure  [ filter ] shows the total transmission probability of the blanket and the al filter as function of energy : we note that they produce a reduction of @xmath215% at 2 kev and @xmath91% at 6 kev in the collimator effective area .    in the case of the lead - glass",
    ", we used the attenuation coefficient plotted in fig .",
    "[ glass_att ] also retrieved from the nist database using the chemical information for the specific glass used .",
    "the thickness of the glass crossed by the incident photon takes into account the path through the pore septal walls to accurately simulate transmission through the collimator structure .",
    "the database of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory s center for x - ray optics provides the reflectivity at different values of the surface micro - roughness for several materials .",
    "+ we derived tables for different levels of surface micro - roughness from this database in order to allow us to evaluate the effect of micro - roughness on the reflection probability , both as function of the photon energy and incident angle .",
    "tables corresponding to lead - glass were used initially to obtain the results presented in campana et al .",
    "however , considering that the heavier elements are leached during the etching process @xcite , we used reflectivity tables for sio@xmath10 in the simulations presented in this paper .    the analysis methodology applied in our work",
    "assumes that the level of micro - roughness is sufficient to characterize the reflectivity i.e. micro - roughness is dominant .",
    "this hypothesis is based on the observation that the fraction of photons that reach the focal plane after reflection is lower than 20% at any incident angle . moreover , only 2% of these scattered photons experience multiple scatterings .",
    "we computed the transmission function at each value of micro - roughness and compared it to the empirical data , choosing the best fit as the one that minimises the root mean square ( @xmath11 ) of the differences between the measured and the simulated data .",
    "we adopted this as our reflectivity model in the calculations that follow . in these simulations , we assumed 1@xmath3 as level of misalignments in the pore orthogonality @xcite .",
    "we found that data are best reproduced by the reflectivity profile from 14 nm surface micro - roughness .",
    "this level of micro - roughness is , quite significantly higher than values quoted in literature for lead glass mcps @xcite and is probably due to the very large aspect ratio of the channels in this collimator .",

    "both the capillary reflectivity described above and the intrinsic misalignments in the collimator axes ( both due to the mcp collimator itself and errors introduced by assembly and alignment tolerances of the modules and panels ) affect the lad sensitivity by altering the transmission function .",
    "these errors lead to reduced effective area for on - axis sources and increased background from off - axis point sources and the diffuse x - ray background reducing the overall sensitivity .",
    "these effects are quantified here by including the reflectivity model constrained by lab data in the lad simulator and by assuming a total misalignment error of 2.5@xmath3 ( the total error budget ) . in practise , this is all attributed to pore orthogonality in the simulator , however , this simplification will have no impact on the results .",
    "the collimator transmission function is modified by the capillary reflectivity and by misalignments .",
    "the misalignments introduce a reduction of the effective area on - axis and increase the amount of background collected from off - axis , this effect is almost independent of energy and mainly confined to small incident angles determined by the overall alignment errors .",
    "the effect of reflectivity is more subtle . for a perfect collimator with no alignment errors , it has no effect on - axis as no area of channel walls are projected towards the source , however , it does allow increased collection of background from off - axis . for a real collimator , with intrinsic misalignments ,",
    "the effect is more complex - for on - axis sources the reflectivity allows rays to continue to reach the detector plane even though they have hit a wall , meaning the effect of misalignments is decreased .",
    "however , it is generally true that significant reflectivity will reduce sensitivity as more background will be collected . + for the values adopted in the simulations , the largest reduction in effective area due to misalignments ( @xmath25% ) is completely cancelled in the energy range 2 17 kev by the reflectivity enhancement .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ trasm_2 ] where the ratio between the transmission with and without reflectivity is plotted as function of energy for two incident angles .",

    ", the canonical triangular shape is also shown with a blue curve .",
    "we note that in both curves the reduction of the transmission function with respect to the on axis value is lower than for the triangular one at small angles ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "in particular , the decrease of the effective area is less than 5% up to 10@xmath3 for 3 kev photons .    considering that x - ray spectra decrease with energy",
    ", we evaluated the reduction expected in the observed rate of a typical source located 5@xmath3 off - axis whose spectrum is modelled by a power law with photon index @xmath13=2 .",
    "we found that the rate is lowered by @xmath21% with respect to the on axis value , and comparing this to the reduction expected from a pure geometrical collimator ( @xmath28% ) , the adopted level of reflectivity produces a flat response within the alignment accuracy angles ( at least at 6kev ) , meaning that spurious modulations due to pointing accuracy are minimised .",
    "a drawback of this flatter transmission function is the increase of the diffuse background that reaches the focal plane with a consequent degradation in sensitivity .",
    "we evaluated the effect of the capillary reflectivity on the level of the transmitted cxb simulating a uniformly distributed diffuse source with photon directions randomizes up to an off - axis angle of 70@xmath3 and energies @xmath14 drawn in the range 230 kev according to the model @xcite :    @xmath15    the cxb rate at the focal plane is obtained by convolving the spectrum transmitted by the collimator with the detector response matrix : the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ geant4 ] ( red line ) .",
    "this result agrees ( within the statistical errors ) with the spectrum published in campana et al .",
    "( 2013 ) obtained using the reflectivity of lead - glass .",
    "+ comparing the spectrum with the one obtained without pore wall reflectivity and misalignments , the highest increase is observed below 4 kev where an increase of @xmath235% is detected . at higher energies",
    ", the reflectivity contribution reduces and the cxb increase is @xmath220% in the range 46 kev and only @xmath210% in the range 610 kev .",
    "we found that reflectivity induces a significant increase of the transmission function at low angles .",
    "consequently , the cxb background is increased dependant on the energy and direction of the incident photon .",
    "loft s scientific objectives require the observations of sources up to fluxes of 1 - 10 mcrab ( 10@xmath16  10@xmath17 erg @xmath18 s@xmath19 ) .",
    "this can be achieved if the level of background is kept lower than 10 mcrab ( equivalent to 1.6@xmath410@xmath20 counts @xmath18 s@xmath19 ) in the nominal 230 kev energy range . from a detailed study , performed with a geant4 simulator ,",

    "[ geant4 ] with a black and a green line , respectively .",
    "the larger transmission function at low energies could also worsen the contamination from off - axis sources making the observation of crowded fields such as the galactic bulge and plane difficult because of source confusion . to evaluate this effect",

    "the number of sources whose spectrum will be contaminated for more than 10% is statistically equivalent to the number obtained with the triangular transmission function .",
    "+ we can conclude that the reflectivity measured in the lab collimator does not degrade the required lad performances .    in order to determine what impact different micro - roughness would have on signal to noise in the lad band fig  [ diffuce ] and fig .",

    "we obtained a model of the reflectivity from the inner walls of the pores in the lad collimator and verified them against a set of empirical measurements .",
    "lab data were best fit assuming reflectivity from sio@xmath10 with a surface micro - roughness of 14 nm ; it is believed that the extreme channel lengths explain the difference between this and prior lower published values for the surface micro - roughness .    including these results in the simulator and taking into account the total misalignments assumed for the lad , we compute the transmission function and , hence , the level of cxb at the focal plane in order to evaluate the effects of reflectivity on the collimator performance .",
