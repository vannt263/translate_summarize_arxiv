    "almost all cosmological observations today suggest that the expansion of the present universe is accelerating . to account for the present cosmic acceleration , one usually assumes an enigmatic component called dark energy .",
    "although many authors have investigated the dark energy to date , we still do not know its nature yet . in most researches of dark energy , one often parameterizes dark energy with its equation of state @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are pressure and energy density of dark energy .",
    "current cosmological observations such as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , type ia supernovae ( sneia ) , large scale structure ( lss ) and so on can give a constraint on @xmath5 .",
    "when one puts constraint on the equation of state , it can be assumed to be constant in time for simplicity .",
    "however many models of dark energy proposed so far has a time - dependent equation of state .",
    "thus most of recent study of dark energy accommodate its time dependence in some way .",
    "although its time dependence can be complicated in general , it is usually assumed a simple form such as @xmath6 @xcite when one tries to limit @xmath5 accommodating its time dependence .",
    "some authors have also discussed the constraint on dark energy using the time evolution of the energy density of dark energy itself or hubble parameter by binning to divide them into several epochs @xcite .",
    "in addition to the time dependence of the equation of state , there is another property of dark energy of which we have to take care .",
    "in fact , in various models of dark energy , dark energy can fluctuate and then its fluctuation can affect the cosmic density perturbations such as cmb and lss . when one specifies a model for dark energy , one can investigate its effects of fluctuation using the perturbation equations in the model .",
    "however , because there are many models proposed to date , one may prefer to describe it in a phenomenological way . to describe the nature of fluctuation of dark energy , the ( effective ) speed of sound",
    "@xmath7 has been used in many works so far .",
    "some authors have investigated the constraints on the equation of state varying the speed of sound @xcite and on the speed of sound itself @xcite .",
    "since the fluctuation of dark energy mostly come into play after when dark energy becomes the dominant component of the universe , the effects of it appear on large scales .",
    "hence , when one tries to limit the speed of sound from observations of cmb , one does not obtain a severe constraint on it because the cosmic variance error is large there .",
    "however , some studies have shown that the constrains on the equation of state can vary with the assumption for the perturbation property of dark energy .",
    "for example , when one assumes that there is no fluctuation of dark energy , the constraint for the constant equation of state is @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , when one takes into account the perturbation of dark energy , the constraint becomes @xmath9 where @xmath10 is assumed @xcite .",
    "thus , in this sense , it is important to investigate the properties of dark energy fluctuation from the viewpoint not only from to reveal its fluctuation nature but also from constraining the equation of state for dark energy .",
    "in fact , to parameterize the perturbation property of dark energy , the use of the speed of sound is not enough . if one considers the possibilities of imperfect fluid models for dark energy , one also needs to specify its anisotropic stress in some way .",
    "in fact , there are some models proposed which have such anisotropic stress ( for example , @xcite ) .",
    "there are also a few works which accommodate such possibilities from a phenomenological point of view @xcite .",
    "in particular , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have discussed the implications of the anisotropic stress to observations such as cmb .",
    "although they investigated its effects in some detail , cosmological constrains in such models was not given .",
    "since we have now precise measurements of cosmology , it is worth to investigate constraints for dark energy in such a general setting .    the purpose of the present paper is to discuss a generalized dark energy including the possibilities of anisotropic stress and give the constraints on cosmological parameters assuming such a generalized dark energy .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the formalism for the investigation of a generalized dark energy .",
    "the perturbation equations are also given there .",
    "then , in section 3 , we discuss the effects of dark energy fluctuation on cmb , with particular attentions to the anisotropic stress of dark energy . in section 4",
    ", we present the constraints on dark energy from current cosmological observations .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "in this section , we summarize the formalism to investigate a generalized dark energy .",
    "some detailed descriptions of this issue can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the background evolution of dark energy can be parameterized by its equation of state @xmath11 .",
    "the evolution of the energy density of dark energy is given by solving @xmath12 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the conformal time and @xmath13 is the conformal hubble parameter with @xmath14 being the scale factor .",
    "as far as the background evolution is concerned , this equation is enough to specify the effect of dark energy on the evolution of the universe .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , dark energy component itself can fluctuate and affect cosmic density fluctuations . for the fluctuation of dark energy fluid",
    ", we have to specify more in addition to the equation of state . here",
    "we briefly summarize what we need to consider a general dark energy . in the rest of the paper , we follow the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite and work in the synchronous gauge whose metric perturbations are denoted as @xmath15 and @xmath16 unless otherwise stated .",
    "we also sometimes make use of the gauge - invariant gravitational potentials , which appear as metric perturbations in the conformal newtonian gauge , to discuss the effects of fluctuation of dark energy .",
    "to specify the nature of dark energy perturbation , we need to give its pressure perturbation and anisotropic stress . for the pressure perturbation",
    ", it may be useful to separate it to adiabatic and non - adiabatic parts .",
    "when the dark energy fluid is adiabatic , the evolutions of pressure perturbation can be specified with the adiabatic sound speed @xmath17 which is written as @xmath18 then pressure perturbation is given as @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath20 and the time evolution of @xmath5 is small compared with the hubble expansion rate , @xmath17 can be negative and the adiabatic pressure can not support density fluctuations .",
    "however , in general , non - adiabatic pressure fluctuation may arise .",
    "such a degrees of freedom can be parameterized with the so - called ( effective ) speed of sound which is defined as @xmath21 this quantity is usually specified in the rest frame of dark energy and we follow the convention here .",
    "a famous example of dark energy models with non - adiabatic pressure fluctuation is a scalar field , called quintessence , which has the speed of sound @xmath10 .",
    "other models such as k - essence , a scalar field model which can have a non - canonical kinetic term , can have different values for the speed of sound . in the adiabatic case , @xmath7 and @xmath17 coincide .",
    "in fact , to consider a general fluid model for dark energy , the speed of sound is not enough to specify its nature . we still have to determine an anisotropic stress for dark energy . including the anisotropic stress , perturbation equations for density and velocity fluctuations are @xmath22 \\frac{\\theta_x}{k^2 }   - 3 \\mathcal{h } ( c_s^2 - w_x ) \\delta_x - ( 1 + w_x ) \\frac{h'}{2 }   \\label{eq : delta_x}\\\\ \\theta_x '   & = &   -\\mathcal{h } ( 1 - 3c_s^2 ) \\theta_x   + \\frac{c_s^2 k^2}{1 + w_x } \\delta_x -k^2 \\sigma_x \\label{eq : theta_x}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent density , velocity and anisotropic stress perturbations here and @xmath25 in ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath26 ] for a general fluid , respectively .",
    "the anisotropic stress can be presented as the viscosity and damps velocity perturbation in sheer - free frame .",
    "thus , in addition to the sound speed of dark energy @xmath7 , there is another freedom to specify the anisotropic stress @xmath24 of dark energy .",
    "in fact , it may be possible to choose @xmath24 demanding that it is consistent with viscous damping of velocity perturbation in sheer - free frame . however ,",
    "in this paper we follow a phenomenological approach of ref .",
    "@xcite . considering the transformation property between frames , @xmath24 should be gauge invariant thus its evolution can be given by the gauge - invariant combinations of some metric and velocity shear . taking into account the dissipation ,",
    "the anisotropic stress can be obtained by solving @xcite @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the viscosity parameter which specifies the nature of an anisotropic stress for dark energy .",
    "in fact , in some literatures , another parameter @xmath29 is called the viscosity parameter , which is related to @xmath28 as @xmath30 however , in this paper , we use @xmath28 as the viscosity parameter .",
    "it should be mentioned that @xmath28 must be kept positive to preserve the physical effects where the viscosity damps the perturbations .",
    "thus , in the following we consider the case with @xmath31 .",
    "we modified camb code @xcite to include a general dark energy fluid to calculate cmb and matter power spectra .",
    "we also checked our results by modifying cmbfast @xcite and found that they both give the same results with good accuracy .",
    "in this section , we discuss the effects of dark energy fluctuation , paying particular attentions to the anisotropic stress of dark energy . since the dark energy can be a dominant component of the universe only at late times , the effects of dark energy fluctuation is significant on large scales . at early times . ] in particular , as we will show in the following , the effects of the anisotropic stress are significant at low multipoles of cmb power spectrum , through the late time integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
    "since the isw effect is driven by the change of the gravitational potential , we start our discussion with investigating the gravitational potential by changing the viscosity parameter @xmath28 . in fact , as it has been discussed in the literature @xcite , the non - adiabatic pressure fluctuation , which is usually characterized by the effective speed of sound @xmath7 , can also affect the late time isw effect .",
    "thus we also discuss the effects of the non - adiabatic pressure fluctuation along with that of the anisotropic stress .",
    "since we are going to discuss the effects on the isw effect , first we show time derivative of the gravitational potential @xmath32 at present time in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] as a function of wave number @xmath33 for several values of @xmath28 and @xmath7 . here and hereafter",
    "gravitational potentials are normalized at super horizon scales such that @xmath34 with @xmath35 being neutrino fraction , and the conformal time coordinate is in units of mpc following the convention .",
    "the equation of state for dark energy is assumed as @xmath36 in this figure .",
    "when we vary @xmath28 , @xmath7 is assumed to be @xmath37 and vice versa .",
    "for illustrative purpose , other cosmological parameters are fixed as @xmath38 ( dark matter density ) , @xmath39 ( baryon density ) , @xmath40 ( hubble parameter ) , @xmath41 ( optical depth to the last scattering surface ) and @xmath42 ( spectral index of primordial density fluctuation ) , which are mean values for @xmath43cdm model from the analysis using wmap3 data alone @xcite . in this paper , we assume that the universe is flat and no running of scalar spectral index and no tensor mode contribution . unless otherwise stated , we use the above cosmological parameters except for those of dark energy .",
    "as seen from the figure , the change of the gravitational potential increases as @xmath28 and @xmath7 becomes larger . since @xmath28 represents the strength of the anisotropic stress , which damps velocity perturbations , the increase of @xmath28 drives the change of the gravitational potential .",
    "thus we obtain larger isw effect as @xmath28 increases . as for the effects of the non - adiabatic pressure fluctuation",
    ", @xmath7 determines the sound horizon @xmath44 under which dark energy can be assumed as  smooth \" component .",
    "when dark energy is considered to be smooth , fluctuation of dark energy can act as stabilizing force for the gravitational potential , which leads to the decay of the gravitational potential . above the sound horizon ,",
    "dark energy can cluster , thus only gravitational force can be relevant to the evolution of the gravitational potential .",
    "the transition between  smooth \" regime to clustered regime occurs at larger scales as @xmath7 increases .",
    "thus the larger values of @xmath7 cause the more late time isw effect , which can be observed in the figure .",
    "for the effects of the non - adiabatic pressure fluctuation , the behavior of the gravitational potential differs depending on @xmath7 only around the transition regime but not at smooth or clustered limit .",
    "however , for the anisotropic stress , the isw effect depends on @xmath28 on large scales . to see this clearly",
    ", we show the present value of @xmath45 as a function of @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . for the case with @xmath28",
    "being fixed and varying @xmath7 , it can be clearly seen that the behaviors on large / small scales are the same and they differ only at transition regime .",
    "however , for the case with @xmath7 being fixed and varying @xmath28 , corresponding lines depend on the value of @xmath28 even on large scale limit .",
    "since the parameter @xmath28 determines the magnitude of the anisotropic stress @xmath24 through eq .  , the change of the gravitational potential is also affected by the magnitude of @xmath28 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath7 only determines the sound horizon which differentiates clustering property of dark energy , thus the magnitude of @xmath7 itself is not directly relevant to the amount of the change of the gravitational potential .",
    "this is one of the differences between the effects of @xmath7 and @xmath28 although they affect fluctuation on large scale in a similar way .",
    "furthermore , it is well - known that @xmath46 and @xmath47 coincide when there is no anisotropic stress , in other words , @xmath48 is sensitive to the anisotropic stress perturbation @xmath49 .",
    "this can be understood from the perturbed einstein equation , as @xmath50 where the quantity in the rhs is for the total matter . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , the values of @xmath48 at the present time are shown for several values of @xmath28 as a function of wave number . as seen from the figure , @xmath51 becomes larger as @xmath28 increases on large scales , which can be easily understood since larger values of @xmath28 means large anisotropic stresses from dark energy .",
    "another point which should be noticed is that the effect of it becomes larger on large scales . for the generalized dark energy with non - zero @xmath28",
    ", the viscosity acts against the gravitational collapse once the modes come across the horizon ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "therefore the perturbations including the anisotropic stress @xmath49 have damped more at smaller scales , which makes the effect significant only at large scales at present .",
    "now we are going to discuss the effects on cmb tt power spectra . in figs .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] , the cmb tt power spectra are depicted for several values of @xmath28 and @xmath7 .",
    "the value of the equation of state @xmath5 are found in the captions . as noted above ,",
    "since the dark energy can be dominant component of the universe only at late times , its fluctuation affects the cmb power spectra on large scales .",
    "thus we only show low multipole region in the figures . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , @xmath52 increases as @xmath28 increases for the case with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this is expected from the argument on the isw effect above . however ,",
    "when the equation of state is less than @xmath55 , the tendency is the opposite , i.e. , as the @xmath28 increases , the large scale power decreases .",
    "this can be understood by looking at the source term in the perturbation equation .",
    "the anisotropic stress can affect the evolution of the gravitational potential through the change of density and velocity perturbations .",
    "such an effect is induced by the source term in eq .   which depends on the prefactor @xmath56 .",
    "thus the effect should be different depending on the sign of the factor @xmath56 .",
    "hence the tendency becomes the opposite for the cases with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "when the value of the sound speed is fixed as @xmath10 , the effects of the anisotropic stress become insignificant for any value of @xmath5 . for the case with @xmath10 , most scales relevant to low multipole region where dark energy fluctuation can be important are in smooth regime .",
    "as shown above , the anisotropic stress can affect the gravitational potential , at least superficially , similarly to smoothed dark energy .",
    "hence when dark energy can be assumed as a smooth component , the effect of the anisotropic stress becomes irrelevant since dark energy is already smoothed .    for comparison",
    ", we also show the same plot for the effects of the non - adiabatic pressure fluctuation . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , cmb tt power spectra are shown for several values of @xmath7 fixing @xmath28 and other parameters .",
    "since the effects of the anisotropic stress and non - adiabatic pressure fluctuation are similar in the isw effect , the tendency should be also the same as that of the effects of @xmath28 . as anticipated , in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , we can see almost the same behavior of low multipole region for the case with @xmath7 being varied , as for the case with @xmath28 being varied .",
    "thus we can expect that there are some degeneracy between the effects of @xmath28 and @xmath7 on the fluctuation at low multipoles of cmb . as discussed above",
    ", they affect the isw effect which enhances / reduces the power at low multipoles depending on the strength of these effects characterized by @xmath28 and @xmath7 .",
    "although the origin of these effects are different in nature , they seem to affect low multipoles of cmb in the same manner . to see this quantitatively , we show the contours of constant ratio of @xmath59 at between @xmath60 and the first peak in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] . in the figure , the equation of state of dark energy",
    "is assumed as @xmath61 .",
    "other cosmological parameters are also fixed as the values already noted above .",
    "notice that higher multipole region @xmath62 is unchanged by varying the values of @xmath7 and @xmath28 .",
    "the ratio represents how low multipoles are enhanced / reduced by the effects of the anisotropic stress and non - adiabatic pressure fluctuation .",
    "the figure indicates that some combination of @xmath7 and @xmath28 give the same effect on large scales .",
    "thus when we study the constraint from observations , we can expect some degeneracy between @xmath7 and @xmath28 .",
    "we discuss this issue in the next section .    here",
    "we should make a comment on a nontrivial cancellation between the isw effect and the cross correlation between the isw and sachs - wolfe ( sw ) effect . although we argued that larger values of @xmath28 give the larger isw effect for the case with @xmath57 , the lines of @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] do not obey this rule .",
    "in fact , this is because the isw and sw effects can nontrivially cancel those effects in some cases .",
    "we discuss this issue briefly .",
    "for this purpose , we make use of the transfer function on large scales .",
    "formally , @xmath52 is written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the primordial power spectrum and @xmath67 represents the transfer function for a multipole moment @xmath68 at present time . on large scales ,",
    "@xmath69 are mostly determined by the contribution from the sw and isw effect , thus it can be written as @xmath70 in particular , the contribution from the isw effect is given by @xmath71~,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the optical depth along the line of sight , @xmath46 is the gravitational potential and @xmath73 is the spherical bessel function .",
    "we plot @xmath74 as a function of wave number @xmath33 for several values of @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] for the case with @xmath36 . as seen from the figure , @xmath75 becomes larger as @xmath28 increases .",
    "in fact , as mentioned above , the quadrupole @xmath76 for @xmath63 is larger than that for the case with @xmath77 although the isw effect is larger for @xmath77 .",
    "thus , at first sight , it looks contradictory . however , this comes from a non - trivial cancellation between the contributions from the isw effect @xmath78 and the cross correlation between the sw and isw effects @xmath79 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] , we also plot @xmath80 as the same manner as fig .  [ fig:7 ] .",
    "when @xmath28 is larger , the cross correlation becomes also large in amplitude as seen from the figure .",
    "however , notice that , since the cross correlation of the sw with the isw effects can give a negative contributions to the transfer function . thus , for some cases , it gives smaller quadrupole amplitude as a whole effect .",
    "this is the reason why the low multipoles for the case with @xmath63 is larger than that for @xmath77 even though the contribution from the isw effect monotonically becomes larger as increasing @xmath28 . for reference",
    ", we also show the same plot for the case with @xmath81 on the right panel in figs .",
    "[ fig:7 ] and [ fig:8 ] .",
    "in this section , we show the constraints from current cosmological observations on the energy density and equation of state of dark energy .    to include the effects of non - adiabatic pressure fluctuation and anisotropic stress of dark energy ,",
    "we calculate theoretical angular power spectrum by camb code modified according to the details in section 2 .",
    "because these effects change the power at larger angular scales , the amplitude and the shape of the power spectrum at low multipoles can be used in principle to put constraints on these fluctuation properties . in fact , however , we can not find any significant limits on them because of the large errors due to the cosmic variance at low multipoles .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the current cosmological observations can not put tight constraints on the @xmath28 or @xmath82 parameters .",
    "( the forecast of observational constraint on @xmath83 from planning galaxy surveys can be found in @xcite . )",
    "even though one can not give limits on these parameters themselves , it does not mean that they are irrelevant when considering the constraints on the nature of dark energy .",
    "it can happen that one obtains different limits on the cosmological parameters such as equation of state of dark energy @xmath5 if one takes different parameters on the fluctuation property of dark energy such as effective sound speed @xmath82 and/or anisotropic stress @xmath28 .",
    "many observational proposals aim to determine the equation of state parameter of dark energy @xmath5 as precise as possible , even up to @xmath84% level @xcite , because the information about @xmath5 is important to pin down a model for dark energy , and also to determine the future of universe @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate how much different assumptions on the fluctuation properties of dark energy can lead the different observational limits on the equation of state of dark energy .    to study this explicitly , we made likelihood analysis to put constraint on @xmath5 with several different assumptions on @xmath83 and @xmath28 .",
    "the likelihood functions we calculate are based on wmap three year data @xcite and the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite . to make analysis general enough",
    ", one has to vary the other cosmological parameters which also affect the shape of the cmb and matter power spectra . in order to do so",

    "as seen from the figure , the constraint on @xmath5 for the case with @xmath54 and @xmath94 becomes severer compared to the other case .",
    "this is due to the fact that the isw effect becomes significant as @xmath5 decreases to negative value when @xmath95 , which makes the fit to the data worse at low multipole region .",
