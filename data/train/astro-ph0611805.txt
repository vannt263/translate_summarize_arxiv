    "while the evolution of the dark matter is reasonably well understood , the evolution of the baryonic component is much less certain because of the complexity of the relevant physical processes , such as star formation and feedback . with the",
    "commonly employed , schematic star formation criteria alone , the predicted star formation rates ( sfrs ) are higher than what is compatible with the observed luminosity density . thus feedback mechanisms are in general invoked to reheat gas and suppress star formation .",
