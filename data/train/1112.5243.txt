    "it is well known that the decays of the @xmath1 meson are very promising tools to constrain the standard model ( sm ) parameters , serve to determine the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , enable us to understand the origin of the cp violation and help us search for new physics ( np ) effects beyond the sm .",
    "one of the possible decay modes of the @xmath1 meson is the semileptonic @xmath0 .",
    "this channel proceeds via flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) transition of @xmath2 at quark level , which is induced at loop level in the sm and is therefore sensitive to np effects .",
    "the extra dimensions as np effects can contribute to such loop level transitions and enhance the branching ratio .",
    "it has been shown that , in the presence of a single universal extra dimension ( ued ) compactified on a circle with radius @xmath3 , the branching ratios of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 which are also based on @xmath6 , increase significantly at lower values of the compactification factor , @xmath7 @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we investigate the effect of the ued on some physical observables related to the semileptonic @xmath0 .",
    "the ued with a single extra dimension called the appelquist , cheng and dobrescu ( acd ) model @xcite , is a kind of extra dimension ( ed ) @xcite which allows the sm fields ( both gauge bosons and fermions ) to propagate in the extra dimensions ( for more details see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the acd model has been previously applied to many decay channels .",
    "for some of them see @xcite and references therein .    in the sm",
    ", the effective hamiltonian describing the @xmath0 transition at quark level can be written as : @xmath8~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 are elements of the ckm matrix , @xmath10 is the fine structure constant , @xmath11 is the fermi constant , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are wilson coefficients . in the acd model , the form of the effective hamiltonian remains unchanged but due to the interaction of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) particles with the usual sm particles and also with themselves , the wilson coefficients are modified .",
    "this modification is done in @xcite in leading logarithmic approximation in a way that each wilson coefficient is written in terms of some periodic functions as : @xmath15 where , @xmath16 is ordinary sm part and the other part can be written in terms of the compactification factor @xmath7 , by means of the following definitions : @xmath17 where , @xmath18 is the mass of the top quark , @xmath19 is the mass of the @xmath20 boson , @xmath21 is the mass of the kk particles and @xmath22 corresponds to the ordinary sm particles .",
    "few comments about the lower bound of the compactification factor are in order . from the electroweak precision tests ,",
    "the lower limit for @xmath7 had been previously obtained as @xmath23 in @xcite if @xmath24 expressing larger kk contributions to the low energy fcnc processes , and @xmath25 if @xmath26 .",
    "analysis of the @xmath27 transition and also anomalous magnetic moment had shown also that the experimental data are in a good agreement with the acd model if @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "taking into account the leading order ( lo ) contributions due to the exchange of kk modes as well as the available next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) corrections to also @xmath29 in the sm , the authors of @xcite have obtained a lower bound on the inverse compactification radius @xmath30 . using the electroweak precision measurements and also some cosmological constraints , the authors of @xcite and @xcite have found that the lower limit on compactification factor is in or above the @xmath31 range .",
    "we will plot the physical observables under consideration in the range @xmath32gev$ ] just to clearly show how the results of the ued deviate from those of the sm and grow decreasing the @xmath7 .",
    "the numerical values for different wilson coefficients both in the sm and acd model in the range @xmath32gev$ ] are presented in table  [ scxy ] . from this table",
    ", we see that in the acd model , the @xmath14 is enhanced and @xmath12 is suppressed considerably in comparison with their values in the sm .",

    "these figures are plotted at @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the @xmath74 and @xmath75 channels , respectively . from figures 9 and 10 for the branching fractions , it is clear that the difference between the ued and sm models predictions exist and can not be killed by uncertainties of the form factors especially at lower values of the compactification factor .",
    "the figures 11 - 16 for double lepton polarization asymmetries also depict that except the @xmath88 and @xmath85 in @xmath75 channel and @xmath89 in both lepton channels , there are discrepancies between two model predictions at lower values of the @xmath7 even if the errors of the form factors are encountered .",
    "in conclusion , making use of the related form factors calculated via light - cone qcd sum rules up to next - to - leading order corrections in @xmath92 , we analyzed the sensitivity of the differential branching ratio and various double lepton polarization asymmetries on the compactification factor of extra dimension for the @xmath0 transition .",
    "our numerical calculations depict considerable deviations of the extra dimension model results from the sm predictions .",
    "these differences can not be killed by errors of the form factors in the allowed regions of the compactification parameter previously discussed .",
    "such discrepancies can be interpreted as signals for existing extra dimensions in nature which can be searched for at hadron colliders . as a final note",
    "it is worth to estimate the accessibility to measure the branching ratio and lepton polarization asymmetries .",
    "an observation of a @xmath93 signal for asymmetry of the order of the @xmath94 needs about @xmath95 @xmath96 pairs .",
    "this allow us to measure the branching ratio and the polarization asymmetries shown in the figures ( 1)-(16 ) in principle .",
    "the order of branching ratios show that the @xmath0 decay channel both for @xmath74 and @xmath75 leptons can be detected at lhc .",
    "however , as experimentalists say , there are some technical difficulties to measure the lepton polarizations . in the case of @xmath74 , this lepton should be stopped in order to measure its polarizations which is not yet possible experimentally .",
    "for @xmath75 lepton , we should reconstruct then analyze the decay products of this lepton . in this case , we face with the problem of the efficiency of the reconstruction .",
    "if these technical difficulties over come , by measuring the considered double  lepton polarization asymmetries , we can get valuable information about the nature of interactions included in the effective hamiltonian because as the large parts of the uncertainties are canceled out , the ratio of physical observables such as cp , forward  backward asymmetry and single or double  lepton polarization asymmetries less suffer from the uncertainty of the form factors compared to the branching ratio .",
    "we would like to thank t. m. aliev for his useful discussions .",
