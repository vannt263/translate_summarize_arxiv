    "quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for quantum information processing , communication and exponential speed - up of some computational tasks  @xcite . as a consequence , in the last years",
    ", there has been an increasing interest in quantum correlations in various physical fields , ranging from quantum optics @xcite to nanophysics  @xcite .",
    "furthemore , recently , it was pointed out that nonclassical correlations exist which are more general , and possibly more fundamental then entanglement  @xcite , the so - called quantum discord ( qd ) , which is defined as the difference between total and classical correlations in a system . under suitable conditions qd has been proved to be more robust than entanglement with respect to decoherence  @xcite .",
    "decoherence is indeed the main threat to the possibility to fully exploit the potentialities of quantum correlations for the above mentioned tasks .",
    "in fact , the unavoidable interaction of systems with their environments induces loss of coherence , making the quantum parallelism , essential for quantum computation , ineffective . on the other hand",
    ", environment can even resume quantum correlations or preserve them .",
    "thus , it is very important to analyze the effect of the various kinds of environmental noise on the entanglement and qd dynamics in realistic quantum systems , which can exhibit peculiar phenomena , such as entanglement  @xcite and qd revival .",
    "markov noise is ascribed to environments with short , or rather instantaneous , self - correlations  @xcite .",
    "non - markovian noise  @xcite is associated to environments with memory and may lead to the non - monotonic time dependence of entanglement and qd .",
    "indeed , revival phenomena are found both for couples of qubits interacting directly or indirectly in a common quantum reservoir  @xcite and for noninteracting qubits in independent non - markovian quantum environments  @xcite .",
    "non - markovianity is also studied as a resource for quantum technology  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the environmental quantum noise on the entanglement dynamics between quantum systems has been interpreted in terms of the transfer of the correlations back and forth from the two - qubit system to the various parts of the global system .",
    "however , recent works showed that the non - monotonic time dependence of the amount of quantum correlations may occur in two - qubit systems under the local action of a system - unaffected environment , such as classical random external potentials  @xcite . due to the classical nature of the noise , in this case",
    "no back - action - induced correlations can be transferred from the system to the environment .",
    "thus , the occurrence of entanglement revival in a non - markovian classical environment is in contrast to the well - established interpretation of revivals in terms of system - environment quantum back action , and rises the fundamental question of how one could explain the effect of classical noise on quantum correlations dynamics in bipartite systems .    in this work ,",
    "we intend to analyze the role played by a classical noisy environment into the entanglement and qd dynamics between two quantum particles in a simple system , which not only allows us to relate the intrinsic features of the two - particle dynamics to the revival of the correlations , but can also be of great relevance in various physical phenomena . specifically , we consider two qubits non interacting between each other and coupled to noise in different and common environments .",
    "two different kind of noise are considered : static and random telegraph noise ( rtn ) .",
    "the former has also been used to describe electron transport  @xcite and photon propagation@xcite in disordered structures .",
    "the latter represents one of the common environmental noises affecting charge carriers in nanodevices and also plays a key role into the building up of @xmath0 noises appearing in a large number of solid - state systems@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we used an analytical approach to solve the two - qubit model , and therefore to estimate its time evolution .",
    "numerical techniques are also adopted to evaluate the dynamics of quantum correlations .",
    "static noise is here used to simulate a non - markovian environment .",
    "to this aim random time - independent terms are inserted in the off - diagonal coefficients of the single - qubit hamiltonians . on the other hand",
    ", a dynamic disorder can model both a non - markov environment , expressed by a slow rtn , and a markovian noise , in the limit of fast rtn . in both cases single - qubits transition amplitudes",
    "are time - dependent and are assumed to stochastically switch between two values .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the physical model adopted is described in sec .",
    "2 . in sec .",
    "3 are presented the results for the various cases considered : static and dynamic noise , different and common environments , markov and non - markov regime .",
    "conclusions and outlooks are given in sec .",
    "in this section we describe a model of two qubits , initially entangled , subject to a noisy classical environment . a static and a random telegraph noise",
    "are accounted for in different conditions , specifically local and non - local interactions between qubits and environments are considered .",
    "furthermore the estimators of quantum correlations are described .",
    "the dynamics of the system is ruled by the hamiltonian : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the single - qubit hamiltonian defined as : @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the identity operator and the pauli matrix of the subspace of the qubit @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "@xmath7 is the qubit energy in the absence of noise ( here we assume energy degeneracy ) , @xmath8 is the system - environment coupling constant and @xmath9 is a random parameter related to the specific characteristics of the noise .",
    "this model has already been used to describe a quantum walk of two not - interacting particles in a noisy lattice  @xcite .    the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) is stochastic due to the randomness of the parameter @xmath10 , thus leading to a stochastic time evolution of the quantum states .",
    "once a choice of the noise parameter is performed , the corresponding evolution operator is given by @xmath11 ( hereafter @xmath12=1 ) .",

    "the two qubits are initially prepared in the bell state @xmath13=@xmath14 .",
    "the static noise has already been used to study the propagation of quantum particles in disordered systems , specifically in optical coupled waveguides and quantum walks  @xcite . in agreement with these works , to model the static noise the adimensional parameters @xmath10",

    "this means that the memory effects of the static noise do not vanish at any time . as a consequence",
    ", we can classify such a noise as non - markovian .",
    "the local coupling between qubits and environment has been mimicked by assuming that the noise parameters of the two qubits @xmath24 and @xmath25 are uncorrelated and described by two flat probability distributions each characterized by the same @xmath18 and @xmath19 . on the other hand , for the case of two qubits interacting with a common environment we set @xmath24=@xmath25 , which means that the same random noise parameter is used in both single - qubit hamiltonians of eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) to model the noise effects .    as stated above , to describe the full dynamics of the two - qubit system subject to the disordered environment the average over all the possible noise configurations is required . for the static noise , such an average",
    "is given by the integral of the time - evolved states each corresponding to a specific choice of the noise parameters .",
    "in other words , for the case of local coupling to different environments the two - qubit density matrix @xmath26 , at time @xmath27 , reads @xmath28 where @xmath29=@xmath30 .",

    "but in the case of two - qubit x states an analytical expression for @xmath57 was derived by luo  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present the explicit forms , as a function of time , of the various mixed states of the two qubits , and the time behavior of entanglement and qd for all the considered physical configurations .",
