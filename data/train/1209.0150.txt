    "it is an important subject in nuclear physics to understand the nuclear structure from the viewpoint of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath9 ) interaction .",
    "the @xmath9 interaction has strong tensor forces at long and intermediate distances caused by the pion exchange and strong central repulsion at short distance caused by the quark dynamics .",
    "it is important to investigate the nuclear structure by treating these characteristics of the @xmath9 interaction  @xcite .",
    "recently , it became possible to calculate nuclei up to mass around @xmath10 using a @xmath9 interaction with the green s function monte carlo method  ( gfmc ) @xcite . at present , this method requires the extreme computational time to be applied to heavier nuclei .",
    "it is desired to develop a new method to calculate nuclear structure with large nucleon numbers by taking care of the characteristic features of the @xmath9 interaction .",
    "the presence of the tensor force in the @xmath9 interaction induces @xmath11-wave components in a nucleus , in particular , for proton - neutron ( @xmath12 ) pairs as the deuteron .",
    "the @xmath11-wave component in the deuteron makes the system bound via the large @xmath13-@xmath11 coupling of the tensor force .",
    "this @xmath11-wave component is also found to be spatially compact as compared with the @xmath13-wave component due to large momentum characters brought by the tensor force @xcite .",
    "this effect originates from the pseudo - scalar nature of the one - pion exchange .",
    "it is reported experimentally that a large fraction of @xmath12 pairs is observed as compared with @xmath14 or @xmath15 pairs in light nuclei @xcite .",
    "this enhancement of @xmath12 pairs is hard to reproduce theoretically in a simple shell model ( mean - field picture ) @xcite except for the rigorous method as the one of gfmc @xcite , which treats the tensor force explicitly .",
    "it is important to make efforts to study high momentum components caused by the tensor force in finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "there are two important developments to perform nuclear structure calculations in heavy nuclei by including the necessary dynamics induced by the bare @xmath9 interaction .",
    "one development is to find out that the strong tensor force is of intermediate range and we are able to express the tensor correlation in a reasonable shell model space  @xcite .",
    "we name this method as tensor optimized shell model ( tosm ) .",
    "the other is the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) to treat the short - range correlation caused by the short - range repulsion  @xcite",
    ". we shall combine these two methods , tosm and ucom , to describe nuclei using a bare @xmath9 interaction . in the tosm part",
    ", the wave function is constructed in terms of the shell model basis states with full optimization of two particle - two hole ( @xmath16 ) states .",
    "there is no truncation of the particle states within the @xmath16 space in tosm , where the spatial shrinkage of the particle states is essential to obtain convergence of the tensor contribution involving high momentum components  @xcite .",
    "this treatment of the bare tensor force in tosm corresponds to the one - pair approximation correlated by the tensor force  @xcite . in a few - body framework ,",
    "the validity of tosm was confirmed by taking only the @xmath17-wave component connected with the @xmath18-wave state directly by the tensor force for the @xmath13-shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "their calculation reproduces more than 90% of the tensor contribution and this result justifies the description of the tensor correlation in tosm .",
    "the explicit inclusion of @xmath16 states in the extended mean field model for heavy nuclei has been formulated by ogawa _",
    "_ as an extended brueckner hartree - fock theory @xcite .",
    "so far , we obtained various successful results of tosm for the investigation of the tensor correlations in he isotopes . in @xmath19he",
    ", we showed the selectivity of @xmath20 configuration in the @xmath16 space with the @xmath12 pair induced by the tensor force and this correlation was recognized as the deuteron - like state @xcite .",
    "this specific @xmath16 excitation plays a decisive role to reproduce the spectra of neutron - rich he isotopes @xcite .",
    "it is found that the @xmath2 occupation of extra neutrons increases the tensor correlation of nuclei from @xmath3he to @xmath21he , while the @xmath1 occupation of extra neutrons decrease the tensor correlation of those nuclei due to the pauli blocking between the specific @xmath16 excitations by the tensor force in @xmath19he and the motions of the extra @xmath1-neutrons .",
    "this configuration dependence of the tensor correlation produces the right amount of splitting energy between the @xmath2- and @xmath1-dominant states in the he isotopes .    in this paper",
    ", we use the tosm+ucom for the study of the li isotopes from @xmath3li to @xmath22li , and discuss their structures focusing on the role of the tensor force on the excitation energies and configurations of those nuclei . before the present analysis , for neutron - rich @xmath23li and @xmath24li ,",
    "we have performed the coupled two- and three - body cluster model analyses assuming the @xmath22li core described using the simplified tosm wave function , respectively @xcite .",
    "the cluster model for two nuclei precisely describes the neutron wave functions in a loosely bound state around @xmath22li , such as a neutron halo structure in @xmath24li .",
    "similar to the case of the he isotopes , we have shown that @xmath22li has the amount of the selected excitation from the @xmath8 orbit to the @xmath25 orbit by the tensor force , and the @xmath1 occupation of last one and two neutrons in @xmath23li and @xmath24li are blocked by this tensor correlation in @xmath22li . as a result , the @xmath26 occupation of last neutrons is relatively enhanced in two nuclei , and the virtual @xmath13-state in @xmath23li , and the large @xmath13-wave mixing and a neutron halo formation in @xmath24li are naturally explained .",
    "on the basis of these successful results for two nuclei , in the present study , we perform a full microscopic analysis by using the tosm+ucom approach using the @xmath9 interaction for the li isotopes .",
    "we investigate the systematic role of the tensor force in @xmath27li .",
    "it is interesting to see the effect of tensor force on the structures of @xmath28li @xcite . in @xmath4li ,",
    "the isospin @xmath29 and @xmath30 states coexist in the low excitation energy region .",
    "the influence of the tensor force on two kinds of states in @xmath4li are important to understand the isospin dependence of @xmath4li in relation with the tensor correlation . in heavier li isotopes ,",
    "the contribution of tensor force is investigated in the ground and excited states .",
    "we also see the high momentum behavior of the kinetic energy in each state in relation with the tensor correlation .",

    "we begin with writing a many - body hamiltonian for a @xmath31 body system as , @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the kinetic energy of each nucleon with @xmath34 being the center of mass kinetic energy .",
    "we take a bare interaction @xmath35 such as av8@xmath0 @xcite consisting of central @xmath36 , tensor @xmath37 and spin - orbit @xmath38 terms and @xmath39 the coulomb term .",
    "we obtain the many - body wave function @xmath40 by solving the schrdinger equation @xmath41 . in our previous works for @xmath42he and a few body systems",
    ", we found that the tensor force can be described by taking @xmath16 excitations with large momentum components in the shell - model framework @xcite .",
    "we prepare first a standard shell - model state for an open shell li nucleus with @xmath31 nucleons in order to introduce the tosm for open shell nuclei .",
    "the standard shell - model state @xmath43 is written as _",
    "s=_k_s a_k_s|(0s)^4(0p)^a-4;k_s  . here , the @xmath44 shell is the valence shell and the index @xmath45 is used to distinguish various shell - model components .",
    "the spirit of the tosm is that the tensor force works strongly for two nucleons in the standard shell - model state and excite two nucleons to various two particle states with high momentum components .",
    "hence , we limit configurations up to two particle - two hole excitations from the standard shell - model state .",
    "we extend therefore first the standard shell - model state by allowing two particles in the @xmath13 shell to excite into the @xmath44 shell .",
    "we name these extended shell - model states as @xmath46 states , since no particle is excited into shell - model orbits outside of the @xmath47 shells .",

    "we take now all the necessary high momentum components brought by the strong tensor force .",
    "these components are included by exciting two nucleons from the @xmath47 shells to higher shells and therefore limit these configurations to @xmath16 states from the standard shell - model state @xmath43 .",
    "hence , we have = |(0s)^n_s(0p)^n_p(higher)^2;k_2with the constraint @xmath51 and @xmath49 .",

    "altogether , we write the tosm wave function @xmath40 for open shell nuclei as @xmath56 here , all the amplitudes @xmath57 are variational coefficients to be fixed by the energy minimization .",
    "we write now the details of the radial wave functions .",
    "the @xmath55 states are shell model states and expressed in terms of harmonic oscillator wave functions .",
    "hence , the @xmath8 and @xmath58 shell - model wave functions are used to express the radial wave functions , whose length parameters are taken independently as variational parameters . the @xmath53 and @xmath16 states involve particle states with high momentum components .",
    "the hole states correspond to the shell - model states in the @xmath47 shells .",
    "the particle wave functions have to contain high momentum components to express the specific characters of the tensor force with all the possible angular momenta until the total energy converges .    for particle states , we employ the gaussian wave functions to express single - particle states in higher orbits in order to describe high momentum properties due to the tensor force  @xcite .",
    "we prefer the gaussian wave functions over the shell - model states in order to effectively include the necessary high momentum components @xcite .",
    "when we superpose a sufficient number of gaussian wave functions , the radial components of the particle states can be fully expressed .",
    "gaussian basis states should be orthogonalized to the hole states and among themselves .",

    "<S> we study the li isotopes systematically in terms of the tensor - optimized shell model ( tosm ) by using a bare nucleon - nucleon interaction as the av8@xmath0 interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the short - range correlation is treated in the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) . using the tosm+ucom approach </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the role of the tensor force on each spectrum of the li isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the tensor force produces quite a characteristic effect on various states in each spectrum and those spectra are affected considerably by the tensor force . the energy difference between the spin - orbit partner , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 orbits of the last neutron , in @xmath3li </S>",
    "<S> is caused by opposite roles of the tensor correlation . in @xmath4li , the spin - triplet state in the @xmath5 coupling configuration </S>",
    "<S> is favored energetically by the tensor force in comparison with @xmath6 coupling shell model states . in @xmath7li , </S>",
    "<S> the low - lying states containing extra neutrons in the @xmath2 orbit are favored energetically due to the large tensor contribution to allow the excitation from the @xmath8-orbit to the @xmath1 orbit by the tensor force . </S>",
    "<S> those three nuclei show the @xmath6 coupling character in their ground states which is different from @xmath4li . </S>"
