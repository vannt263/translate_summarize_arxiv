    "fig : scheme ] , the surface corrugation acts like an antenna to couple the incident light into surface modes that squeeze the em energy into the aperture , leading to high transmission efficiencies at a narrow spectral range .",
    "surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) , modified by the metal corrugation , are responsible for light harvesting in the optical regime ; while in the thz regime , where metals behave as perfect electric conductors ( pec ) and spp modes no longer exist , surface modes are induced by the geometry @xcite .",
    "tuning the optical response of single apertures surrounded by periodic grooves are of particular interest in the context of spectral and polarizing imaging @xcite .",
    "transmission resonances at a given wavelength can be controlled by adjusting the size and geometry of the sga .",
    "its optical response has been optimized by varying groove depth @xcite , periodicity @xcite , aperture size @xcite , metal thickness @xcite , and number of grooves @xcite .",
    "such studies are not limited to uniform and periodic groove arrays , where all grooves are identical and equidistant , but also consider nonuniform and not periodic structures @xcite .",
    "the correlation between geometrical parameters for an efficient light harvesting process ( lhp ) has been discussed in several of the previous references .",
    "authors of ref . @xcite have pointed out the role played by groove cavity modes , waveguide ( fabry - perot ) modes in the slit , and the in phase groove re - emission ( controlled by the period of the groove array ) .",
    "they employed the pec approximation , which has only indicative values at optical frequencies .",
    "refined the numerical exploration of the array geometry explaining how to squeeze additional light into a slit in a real metal by increasing the number of grooves but reducing the size of each groove at the same time @xcite .    .",
    "the slit of width @xmath1 is surrounded by @xmath2 grooves ( width @xmath3 , depth @xmath4 , and period @xmath5 ) .",
    "the distance from the slit to the first groove , @xmath6 , is in principle different from @xmath5.,width=453 ]    the aforementioned studies are limited to some relevant geometrical parameters and often to a fixed wavelength .",
    "moreover , whereas such studies are mainly focused on optical , thz and microwave frequencies , less attention has been paid to the infrared ( ir ) regime , for which one can envisage potential applications in spectroscopic chemical sensing @xcite , bio - sensing @xcite , and light harvesting technologies , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review . in the present paper",
    ", we go one step further and study a broader area of the parameter space and a larger spectral range that extends from optical to ir frequencies .",
    "our first goal is to identify simple design rules for optimal light transmittance by the sga shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "such rules are developed from the physical mechanisms responsible for squeezing light into the central aperture .",
    "our second goal is to further optimize the light harvesting process with help of a conjugate gradient ( cg ) maximization algorithm @xcite that scrutinizes the parameter space of the groove array .",
    "seeds for the cg algorithm are taken from simulations based on physical intuition .",
    "we shall consider uniform and periodic groove arrays as well as nonuniform and not periodic ones , which further enhances the light transmission through the slit .",
    "notice that ref .",
    "@xcite has already explored numerically nonuniform sgas but only in the microwave regime . moreover , a remarkable difference with previous works is that we optimized the lhp for a fixed size of the system .",
    "thus , we perform a full optimization for a given number of grooves and a given wavelength . fixed size optimizations are more fruitful for practical applications , like optical detectors , which usually have a given pixel size and its fabrication is limited by several geometrical constrains .",
    "calculations are done in the framework of the coupled - mode method ( cmm ) @xcite with surface impedance boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "such approximate boundary conditions are applied not only at the horizontal air / metal interfaces but also at the vertical walls of slit and grooves .",
    "this model nicely reproduces experimental results @xcite .    despite the intensive optimization presented here ,",
    "a more efficient lhp can be achieved with slight variations of the geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "such kind of improvements have been largely considered in the literature , e.g. the inclusion of bragg reflectors @xcite , the change of the shape of either the aperture @xcite or the grooves @xcite , or the combination of single apertures perforated on a metal film with dielectric surface gratings @xcite ; see ref .",

    "for the same reason , broader grooves enhance the scattering cross - section between modes inside the grooves and the em radiation @xcite . on the other hand , as the radiation pattern is driven by surface modes running along the metal / air interface , the grooves tend to be shallower to reduce the shadows that apertures closer to the central slit produce on apertures on the edge of the sga .",
    "shallower grooves also implies a smaller scattering cross - section , but this effect is compensated with broader grooves and a larger system size .",
