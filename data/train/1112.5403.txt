    "ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision experiments are being carried out with the goal of creating a thermalized medium made out of deconfined quarks and gluons , known as the quark ",
    "gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "the aim is to study the properties of qgp , from those characterizing a static thermal bath , such as the equation of state and the order of the phase transition , to the dynamical properties , like the transport coefficients , including shear and bulk viscosities of qcd matter . with heavy ion experiments running at rhic and lhc ,",
    "qualitative and quantitative theoretical progress is required both to better understand the existing data and to suggest new observables to measure .",
    "heavy ion collision is a multi - scale process , with the harder momenta dominating the early times right after the collision , and the softer momentum scales becoming relevant at the later time scales . due to the running of the qcd coupling constant the hard modes are weakly - coupled , while the soft modes are coupled strongly . in recent years a body of evidence has accumulated suggesting that the non - perturbative large - coupling effects could be more important for high - energy heavy ion collisions than was previously thought .",
    "perhaps the most important piece of evidence is the success of ideal hydrodynamics in describing the evolution of the medium produced in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "corrections to ideal hydrodynamics are inversely proportional to the coupling constant and are small when the coupling is large .",
    "an example of this is the shear viscosity , which ( at weak coupling ) scales as @xmath0 in a thermal qcd medium with the temperature @xmath1 @xcite : extrapolating this result one sees that the shear viscosity is small when the coupling @xmath2 is large , generating a small correction to the energy - momentum tensor of ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "another argument in favor of strong - coupling dynamics playing an important role in heavy ion collisions is the large amount of jet quenching needed to describe the data coming from rhic and lhc .",
    "the relevant jet quenching parameter @xmath3 , which is proportional to the energy loss per unit path length of an energetic parton traversing a medium @xcite , was found to be rather large in some analyses , possibly indicating that non - perturbative strongly - coupled effects are at work @xcite .",
    "note however that @xmath3 has mass dimension of @xmath4 , and the existence of a large momentum scale @xmath5 likely indicates that at least a part of the process is in fact weakly coupled , and , hence , perturbative . the last piece of evidence suggesting possible importance of strong coupling effects in the qcd plasma comes from lattice simulations , which indicate that the energy density and pressure of the thermal qcd medium is about @xmath6 of that in an ideal gas of quarks and gluons for a broad range of temperatures above the temperature of the qcd phase transition @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "as the strong coupling constant @xmath8 should get small at large-@xmath1 , one expects the high - temperature qcd medium to approach the stefan - boltzmann ideal gas behavior as @xmath1 increases : the approach does take place , but is much slower than expected by in the perturbative qcd calculations , possibly indicating that non - perturbative effects are still important even at reasonably high-@xmath1 .",
    "note however that the resummed perturbation series may successfully describe the lattice data @xcite .",
    "while none of the arguments presented above definitively demonstrates dominance of strong - coupling effects in heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc , we will proceed under the assumption that the strong - coupling effects are important and try to analyze heavy ion collisions assuming that the coupling is large .",
    "one reason for this is that exploring heavy ion collisions in the strong - coupling regime is very interesting by itself , providing a new theoretical angle on the process .",
    "in addition , it may be that the typical strong coupling constant in these collisions is neither very small nor very large , such that both small- and large - coupling approaches would have some chance of describing the data .",
    "the strong - coupling qcd analysis of such an ultrarelativistic process as a heavy ion collision is impossible with the present state of the qcd theory .",
    "instead an opportunity to study the strongly - coupled field theories came up due to advances in string theory , culminating with the formulation of the anti - de sitter space / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite , which is the duality between the @xmath9 @xmath10 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory in four flat space - time dimensions ( conformal field theory , or simply cft ) and the type iib superstring theory on ads@xmath11s@xmath12 . in the limit of large number of colors @xmath13 and large t hooft coupling @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , ads / cft correspondence reduces to the gauge - gravity duality : @xmath9 su(@xmath13 ) sym theory at @xmath16 is dual to the ( weakly coupled ) classical supergravity in ads@xmath11s@xmath12 .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence gives us a powerful tool one can use to systematically study a strongly - coupled gauge theory ( specifically , @xmath9 sym theory ) .",
    "using the ads / cft correspondence one can try to study heavy ion collisions at strong coupling .",
    "indeed one should be mindful about the many differences between qcd and the @xmath9 sym theory : the former is confining , while the latter is not ; qcd coupling runs , while it is a constant in the conformal @xmath9 sym theory ; qcd plasma has a chiral phase transition , while @xmath17 sym plasma does not .",
    "until the errors introduced by using a theory different from qcd are understood , any conclusions we derive from applying the ads / cft correspondence to the study of qcd - mediated processes should be taken as qualitative at best . however , in some cases one may hope that ads / cft predictions are universally valid for all strongly - coupled theories , including qcd .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by some numerical successes of ads / cft , an example of one of which will be shown below .",
    "for reviews of the ads / cft correspondence we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "since our goals in this mini - review are rather applied , we will simply state the tools we need to accomplish them , without presenting any proofs , and illustrate these statements by analyzing some of the properties of the supersymmetric plasma .",
    "ads@xmath11s@xmath12 space is obtained by stacking @xmath13 parallel d3 branes on top of each other .",

    "@xmath24 is the radius of the s@xmath12 sphere . for our purposes",
    "it is important to note that the ads@xmath22 metric in ( everything on the right except for the last term ) satisfies einstein equations @xmath25 with @xmath26 and the cosmological constant @xmath27 .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence is the statement of equivalence of the @xmath9 su(@xmath13 ) sym theory in four space - time dimensions and the type iib superstring theory on ads@xmath11s@xmath12 @xcite . for practical calculations",
    "the duality means the following .",
    "each operator @xmath28 in the four - dimensional cft is paired up with the dual field @xmath29 in the ads@xmath22 bulk .",
    "then the duality can be mathematically formulated as @xcite : @xmath30     \\right\\rangle_{\\mbox{cft}_4 } = z_{\\mbox{string } } \\left [      \\varphi ( x , z ) \\bigg|_{z \\approx 0 } = z^{4 - \\delta } \\ , \\varphi_0 ( x ) \\right].\\ ] ] on the left hand side of we have an expectation value taken in the full four - dimensional cft , while on the right there is a partition function for the type iib superstring theory , calculated with a particular boundary condition on the bulk field @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is the scaling dimension of the operator @xmath33 .",
    "one can show that in the @xmath16 limit the string partition function becomes classical , @xmath34 with @xmath35 the classical action on ads@xmath36s@xmath12 calculated with the @xmath37 boundary condition .",
    "thus the incredibly complicated quantum field theoretical problem of calculating an expectation value in the full cft is reduced to a classical calculation on ads@xmath11s@xmath12 .",
    "this is a great simplification due to the ads / cft correspondence .    as an important example of the use of ads / cft duality which is also useful for heavy ion collisions ,",
    "let us consider a thermal medium made out of strongly - coupled @xmath9 sym matter .",
    "due to thermodynamic properties of black holes , the dual of the thermal medium in the gauge theory is the ads schwarzschild black hole ( adssbh ) with the metric @xcite @xmath38.\\ ] ] the horizon of adssbh metric is located at @xmath39 . introducing the euclidean time @xmath40 the metric",
    "can be extended to the euclidean space - time .",
    "expand the euclidean version of the metric near the horizon by redefining @xmath41 : at the lowest non - trivial order in @xmath42 we get @xmath43 we see that the @xmath44-part of the metric looks like the polar coordinates in 2d , with the metric @xmath45 , if we define the `` angle '' @xmath46 .",
    "the metric @xmath47 has no kink singularity at @xmath48 only if it is periodic in @xmath49 with the period of @xmath50 .",
    "this means that the euclidean time @xmath51 should be periodic with the period of @xmath52 . remembering that a thermal field theory in euclidean space is periodic with the period @xmath53 with @xmath1 the temperature , we ( i ) find the hawking temperature @xmath54 of the ads schwarzschild black hole and ( ii ) identifying the hawking temperature of adssbh with the temperature of the dual gauge theory we obtain @xmath55 the metric of is illustrated in .",
    "we see from that at high temperature @xmath1 the horizon is close to the boundary of the ads space at @xmath56 , while for low @xmath1 the horizon is deep in the ads@xmath22 bulk .        identifying the ads schwarzschild black hole as the gravity dual of the strongly - couples sym plasma allows us to calculate the entropy of the sym plasma by equating it with the bekenstein - hawking entropy of a black hole @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the horizon area and @xmath59 is the newton s constant . since the area of a 5-sphere is @xmath60 , the horizon area for adssbh can be calculated via @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the determinant of the part of the metric in three dimensions @xmath63 .",
    "using we get @xmath64 with @xmath65 the 3d volume occupied by the plasma . using this area in along with @xmath66",
    "we obtain the bekenstein - hawking entropy of adssbh , or , by ads / cft duality , the entropy of the strongly - coupled @xmath9 sym plasma @xcite @xmath67 we have derived an expression for the entropy of a strongly - coupled medium in a thermal field theory by doing a very simple gravity calculation ! indeed the strong - coupling expression corresponds to a sum of an infinite number of feynman diagrams : ads / cft duality allowed us to arrive at the answer in a much simpler way .",
    "should be compared to the stefan - boltzmann entropy of an ideal gas of non - interacting particles in @xmath9 sym theory @xmath68 we see that @xmath69 : the entropy of a strongly - coupled supersymmetric plasma is @xmath70 of that for the ideal gas . as was mentioned before , this result seems to be in a semi - quantitative agreement with the lattice qcd calculations for entropy above @xmath7 giving @xmath71 @xcite , as illustrated in for the entropy density @xmath72 .",
    "note , again , that in interpreting this semi - agreement one has to remember that @xmath9 sym and qcd are different theories , and the @xmath9 sym prediction for @xmath73 would correspond to a horizontal straight line in the plot of exhibiting no temperature dependence .",

    "the ads / cft duality leads to the following prescription for the calculation of @xmath75 , known as the holographic renormalization @xcite .",

    "as we mentioned above , heavy ion collision is a multi - scale process involving an interplay of small- and large - coupling phenomena .",
    "unfortunately no single theoretical framework incorporates both perturbative and non - perturbative effects .",
    "therefore , applying ads / cft duality to heavy ion collisions one has to make a choice of either treating the whole collision as a strongly - coupled process , or , perhaps more realistically , limit the application of ads / cft duality to the description of the produced medium at the later times after the collision when the qcd coupling is more likely to be large . in this section",
    "we will discuss the progress in the former direction , while the advances in the latter one are presented in the next section .",
    "we begin by modeling the whole heavy ion collision in the strongly - coupled framework of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the goal here is rather ambitious , and includes understanding particle production in the collision , followed by the thermalization of the produced matter , along with the subsequent evolution of the resulting thermal medium : essentially one wants to understand the whole collision in a single unified framework . while there is no nuclei ( or other bound states ) that we could imagine colliding in the conformal @xmath9 sym theory , one can follow bjorken @xcite and model the colliding nuclei as the lorentz - contracted thin sheets of matter , which are uniform and extend to infinity in the transverse direction .",
    "the collision of two such `` nuclei '' is illustrated in using light - cone coordinates @xmath88 .    , the time is @xmath89.,width=226 ]    the nucleus moving along the @xmath90-axis ( `` nucleus 1 '' in ) has a large @xmath91 component of its emt , with all other emt components negligibly small .",
    "moreover , due to assumptions we made about the uniform distribution in the transverse plane , @xmath91 is a function of @xmath92 only with its support localized near @xmath93 due to lorentz contraction .",
    "the metric dual to such an ultrarelativistic nucleus which solved einstein equations is that of a gravity shock wave in the bulk @xcite @xmath94 with @xmath95 . the metric dual to `` nucleus 2 '' in is obtained from by the @xmath96 interchange .    the problem of understanding heavy ion collisions in this version of ads / cft approach can be formulated as follows : we know the metric for @xmath97 or for @xmath98 , where it is simply a sum of the two shock wave metrics [ and the one obtained from it by @xmath96 ] .",
    "what is the metric solving einstein equations at @xmath100 , i.e. , in the forward light - cone region , as shown in ?",
    "to date there exists no analytical solution of this problem . on the analytical side the problem was tackled perturbatively order - by - order in the emt s of both shock waves @xcite and by an all - order resummation of the perturbation theory in the emt of one of the shocks @xcite .",
    "one usually approximates the nuclear profiles by delta - functions : defining @xmath101 and @xmath102 for the emt s of the two shock waves , we have @xmath103 with @xcite @xmath104 here @xmath105 , @xmath106 are the large light - cone momenta per nucleon in the two nuclei with atomic numbers @xmath107 and @xmath108 , while @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the typical transverse momentum scales describing the two nuclei .",

    "this implies that on the time scales of the order of @xmath126 the shock wave would lose much of its light cone momentum and would `` stop '' , i.e. , it would either deviate from its light - cone trajectory or would simply dissolve into the produced medium .",
    "this `` stopping '' effect may be due to the following mechanism : the partons in the colliding nuclei branch unchecked due to the large value of the coupling , which results in the shock waves consisting of a huge number of very low - momentum partons .",

    "unfortunately the experimental data gives a much smaller power of energy , @xmath142 @xcite , possibly signaling again that the early stages of heavy ion collisions ( in which the majority of the entropy is produced ) are not strongly - coupled .",
    "note , however , that modifications of ads@xmath22 geometry allow for a better agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "let us now change the strategy and assume that the actual collision is either weakly - coupled or is described by the physics outside the gauge - gravity duality for some other reasons .",

    "the question of the value of @xmath183 in qcd has been extensively studied in lattice qcd @xcite and by viscous hydrodynamics simulations for heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the current estimates place @xmath183 in qcd ( extracted from heavy ion collisions data ) very close to the kss bound @xcite , though one has to remember that qcd is not a conformal theory , and @xmath183 is @xmath1-dependent in qcd unlike @xmath9 sym @xcite .    returning to the time evolution of the strongly - coupled rapidity - independent medium , note that further higher - order @xmath171 corrections have been calculated in @xcite . reversing the problem , one can ask about the possible early - time asymptotics of this medium . it was shown in @xcite",
    "that for @xmath155 only even integer @xmath32 are allowed as @xmath185 .",
    "the non - negativity of the energy density demands that @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario the energy density @xmath187 starts out as a constant in time and eventually begins to fall off like @xmath188 as dictated by bjorken hydrodynamics .",
    "[ note however that if one expands eqs .",
    ", , and to the lowest order in @xmath189 ( as @xmath190 ) one would obtain @xmath191 @xcite , such that @xmath192 , though the medium produced in a shock wave collision is not boost invariant . ] for numerical simulations of rapidity - independent ( boost - invariant ) plasmas see @xcite .",
    "the weakness of the approach presented in this section is at the early times : one has to specify the metric to be used as the initial condition for einstein equations at some small value of @xmath193 .",
    "the emt of the particles formed in the early stages of a heavy ion collision would only specify @xmath194 at @xmath195 in the expansion of the metric near @xmath196 .",
    "higher order metric coefficients @xmath197 , @xmath198 , have to be specified too at @xmath195 : in the ads / cft dictionary they are likely to be dual to some higher - dimensional operators in @xmath9 sym theory .",
    "it appears that to insure the matching between the ( presumably ) weakly - coupled early - time dynamics and the later - time dynamics described by ads / cft one has to specify an infinite tower of expectation values of operators at @xmath195 resulting from the former to be used to initiate the latter .",
    "to date the problem of how to do this in a both rigorous and realistic way remains open .",
    "many experimental signals of qgp formation and evolution can be calculated in the framework of ads / cft duality . above",
    "we have discussed the implications of the ads / cft correspondence for the hydrodynamic description of heavy ion collisions . in the spirit of a brief review , we will only mention one more signal of qgp : jet quenching .",
    "the idea that jets can lose energy in qgp which would lead to their suppression was originally proposed by bjorken in @xcite , with the first calculations of jet quenching in the perturbative qcd framework carried out in @xcite .    in the ads / cft framework",
    "the question of jet energy loss was first tackled in @xcite with the goal of determining a strong - coupling value of the jet quenching parameter @xmath3 originally defined in @xcite in the perturbative qcd framework .",
    "the purely ads approach to jet quenching was first advocated in @xcite and involved calculating the drag force on a heavy quark moving through the sym plasma . at zero temperature",
    "a heavy quark is dual in ads to the endpoint of an open nambu - goto string terminating on a d7 ( flavor ) brane wrapped around s@xmath12 , with the other end of the string stretching to the stack of d3 branes at @xmath199 @xcite . for a finite temperature medium ,",
    "if we work in the coordinate system employed in writing down the metric , we can only follow the string down to the adssbh horizon .",
    "sym plasma.,width=340 ]    let us find the drag force on a heavy quark moving with a constant speed @xmath161 through a supersymmetric plasma ( assume that some external force is applied to keep the quark velocity constant ) . to do this , one first has to find the string configuration in the adssbh background dual to the moving quark .",
    "this is done by extremizing the nambu - goto action of an open sting @xmath200 with the boundary condition requiring that the string endpoint attached to the d7 brane moves with velocity @xmath161 along the @xmath201-axis . here",
    "@xmath77 is the adssbh metric and @xmath202 are sting coordinates : they specify the mapping from the string world - sheet coordinates @xmath203 with @xmath204 to spacetime coordinates @xmath205 .",
    "( note that @xmath206 . )",
    "the resulting classical string configuration is @xmath207 with @xcite @xmath208.\\ ] ] it is illustrated in .",
    "the drag force ( momentum change ) is given by the momentum flow down the string from its endpoint attached to the d7 brane , @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the 3-momentum of the quark and @xmath211 is the canonical momentum of the string defined by @xmath212 using eqs .",
    ", , in gives us the drag force on a heavy quark in the strongly coupled @xmath9 sym plasma @xcite @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "( the mass appears since @xmath215 . )",
    "was derived for a static medium : it was generalized to the case of bjorken hydrodynamics corresponding to the janik - peschanski metric in @xcite with the conclusion that still applies in this dynamic case if one replaces @xmath216 in it , with @xmath217 given by .",
    "the ads / cft result for the drag force allowed for some interesting phenomenology of the heavy quark energy loss at rhic @xcite .",
    "however , one has to be careful applying this large - coupling result to qcd jet physics : due to asymptotic freedom , at least some part of the jet coupling to the medium should be perturbative .",
    "on top of that , the model considered here involves a quark which is being dragged through the medium by an external force which prevents it from slowing down , while in real life the hard partons simply plow through the medium loosing energy and momentum .",
    "modeling of jets in the medium along these more realistic lines was carried out in @xcite .",
    "the conclusion was that , due to strong coupling , the partons are highly likely to branch into more partons , distributing the energy democratically between them . in the end",
    "one obtains an isotropic distribution of partons , very different from the jet cone of perturbative qcd and from the jet cones seen in the actual collider experiments ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this difference between the `` ads jets '' and real life jet gives us another argument in favor of being cautious in applying ads results for jet quenching to the real - life heavy ion collisions .",
    "applications of the ads / cft correspondence to jet quenching are by no means limited by the calculation we have just presented .",
    "further research addressed issues of studying mach cones generated by the supersonic jets , energy loss of light quarks and gluons , momentum broadening of hard partons traversing the medium , quark and gluon stopping distance , dissociation and melting of mesons , along with other topics .",
    "a proper discussion of these important results lies outside of the scope of this brief review .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for a detailed review of these subjects .",
    "our brief review covers several topics on applications of ads / cft correspondence to heavy ion collisions , with an emphasis on modeling the actual collisions , stemming in part from the author s subjective interests and research experience . indeed , due to the compact format of this review",
    ", many important topics in applications of ads / cft correspondence to heavy ion collisions had to be omitted . among those topics",
    "are two - particle correlations ( see @xcite for a pedagogical presentation of their calculation ) , electromagnetic probes @xcite , heavy quark potential at finite temperature @xcite , jet quenching - related observables listed above , and efforts to calculate the elliptic flow @xmath218 in ads @xcite .",
    "we hope that we have convinced the reader that practically any heavy ion observable can be modeled using the ads / cft correspondence , generating interesting qualitative and , sometimes , quantitative insight . in comparing the results of ads / cft calculations to the actual heavy ion data or to lattice qcd simulations one has to be careful to remember the many differences between qcd and @xmath219 sym theory , though one hopes that certain universal features are common for both theories .",
    "one may also hope that future research would put these differences between qcd and @xmath220 sym under quantitative theoretical control .",
