    "rosat observations revealed the existence of a group of soft x - ray sources with well defined and unique characteristics . to date we know seven or eight such objects which are summarized in table  1 .",
    "their energy spectra are well modeled by blackbody emission with kt@xmath1 between 50 and 120 ev and no significant flux changes are observed on time scales of years .",
    "no association with a supernova remnant was found and upper limits derived from radio surveys indicate that the radio luminosity is well below that of ordinary radio pulsars ( for recent reviews see treves et al . 2000 , motch 2001 ) .",
    "x - ray pulsations were discovered from two sources in rosat data and recent chandra and xmm - newton observations identified two further stars as pulsars .",
    "low hydrogen column densities derived from the x - ray spectra indicate that we deal with close and therefore low - luminosity objects ( x - ray dim isolated neutron stars , xdins ) .",
    "although it is now well established that the rosat sources are isolated neutron stars , the origin of their soft x - ray emission is not clear .",
    "the temperatures in the range of ( 0.6  1.4)@xmath2 k inferred from their blackbody - like spectra are typical for young cooling neutron stars with ages less than 10@xmath3 years .",
    "however these young rotation powered pulsars show radio emission and neutron star spin periods well below 1 s , both properties in contrast to that of the new rosat sources .",
    "the long periods would require that these neutron stars were born with either an unusually long period or an unusually strong magnetic field to decelerate the rotation of the neutron star to the current value within its life time ( heyl and hernquist , 1998 ) .",
    "a decaying strong magnetic field could provide a significant source for the x - ray luminosity which , at least in the case of rxj0720.43125 , is too high to be explained by rotational energy losses .",
    "heating by magnetic field decay could also keep the high b field pulsars detectable in x - rays over longer times than ordinary pulsars ( heyl and kulkarni , 1998 ) .    alternatively",
    ", old ( @xmath4 years ) neutron stars could be re - heated by accretion from the interstellar medium , as originally proposed by ostriker , rees and silk ( 1970 ) .",
    "population synthesis studies by treves and colpi ( 1991 ) , blaes and madau ( 1993 ) and madau and blaes ( 1994 ) estimated the number of old , isolated neutron stars detectable in the rosat all - sky survey to several thousands . despite intensive searches however , it became clear that the large galactic population of old neutron stars does not accrete from the interstellar medium at the originally predicted rates ( neuhuser and trmper , 1999 ; motch 2001 ) .",
    "two possible explanations for the elusiveness of old isolated neutron stars were elaborated by treves et al .",
    "the velocity distribution may peak at @xmath0200400 km s@xmath5 , strongly suppressing spherical accretion , or magnetic field decay on timescales of 10@xmath6 years could prevent a large fraction of neutron stars from entering the accretor stage .",
    "the first evidence for a high space velocity of 185 km s@xmath5 was found for rxj1856.53754 , the brightest and possibly nearest ( 117 @xmath7 12 pc derived from parallax measurements ) of the new isolated neutron stars ( walter and lattimer , 2002 ) .",
    "a crucial neutron star parameter for both models is the magnetic field strength and its temporal evolution .",
    "the study of spin histories and measuring spin - down rates can provide estimates for the magnetic field strength , when interpreted in terms of magnetic dipole braking . first @xmath8 measurements for rxj0720.43125 yield a magnetic field strength of the order of 10@xmath9 g ( kaplan et al . , 2002a ; zane et al .",
    "although , this value is below those typically quoted for magnetars ( 10@xmath10 g ) it is still extreme and close to the critical value b@xmath11 = 4.4@xmath1210@xmath9 g at which quantum effects become important .",
    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps , for a recent review see mereghetti et al . ,",
    "2002 ) and soft @xmath13-ray repeaters ( sgrs , for a review see hurley , 2000 ) , which share some common characteristics ( kaspi , 2003 ) , may belong to this class of neutron stars with the strongest known magnetic field strengths .",
    "it is remarkable that the spin periods of axps , sgrs and xdins cluster within a narrow range . to further understand the properties of xdins and their stellar evolution it is therefore crucial to observe them with new generation instruments available on board of chandra and xmm - newton .",

    "cooling neutron stars the strongest spin modulations are difficult to explain with temperature variations as function of magnetic colatitude which would be caused by e.g. a thermal conductivity dependence on the magnetic field vector ( see cropper et al . , 2001 and references therein ) .",

    "the ( 0.10.4 kev)/(0.40.8 kev ) hardness ratio varies sinusoidal similar to the pulsations but is softest slightly before flux maximum .",
    "spectral fits to phase resolved spectra suggest that the majority of the variation is caused by a change in absorption rather than a change in temperature ( cropper et al . ,",
    "2001 ) . while direct changes in photo - electric absorption might be conceivable in terms of material co - rotating in the magnetosphere , the hardness ratio modulation is more likely explained by energy dependent beaming effects .",
    "if such an energy dependence is similar to that of photo - electric absorption fitting an absorbed blackbody model would necessarily lead to variations in absorption .",
    "e.g. burwitz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) modeled the letg spectrum of rxj1856.5@xmath163754 with a blackbody modified by an energy dependent absorption factor of the form @xmath36 = e@xmath37 in addition to photo - electric absorption .",
    "they found a best fit with @xmath38=1.28@xmath70.30 and a reduced column density .",
    "it could well be that in the case of rxj0720.4@xmath163125 the spectral variation is caused by a phase dependent absorption factor , as it may be expected for a condensed matter surface , with varying viewing angles relative to the magnetic field .",
    "such models would not require large temperature variations on the surface of the neutron stars and greatly reduce the related problems in explaining large pulsed fractions .      to measure spin period changes with time are of great importance to independently derive estimates for the magnetic field strength of the neutron star .",
    "in particular in the absence of absorption features in the high resolution spectra of xdins it may be the only way to obtain this information .",
    "measuring pulse period changes should also allow to discriminate between models of cooling and accreting xdins , with more erratic changes expected for the latter .",
    "the best studied case is rxj0720.4@xmath163125 , the brightest xdin showing x - ray pulsations .",
    "kaplan et al . ( 2002a ) derived the first useful upper limit for the period derivative of 3.6@xmath39 s s@xmath5 ( 3@xmath35 ) from the analysis of rosat , sax and chandra data . including xmm - newton data zane et al .",

    "the new period obtained from xmm - newton data is however shorter than the chandra value and a preliminary linear fit to the three available periods ( using values twice as long as the originally reported value of 5.16 s ) yields only an upper limit of @xmath43 s s@xmath5 leaving an indefinite situation for this xdin .",

    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the new results obtained from optical and x - ray observations more and more support the model of young cooling neutron stars for xdins .",
    "the large proper motion of rxj1856.5@xmath163754 yields a small cross section for accretion from the interstellar matter and makes the x - ray luminosity difficult to explain .",
    "also the steady and low spin down rate observed from rxj0720.4@xmath163125 and the infered high magnetic field strength is incompatible with accretion which would require b @xmath44 10@xmath45 g ( haberl et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "the properties of axps are reviewed in a recent article by mereghetti et al .",

    "however the number of known objects , in particular pulsating xdins , is still too low to draw definite conclusions .",
    "the 10.31 s period of 1rxsj130848.6 + 212708 implies a double - peaked pulse profile which is similar to that of the axps 1e2259 + 586 and 4u0142 + 61 .",
    "however the latter changes the relative intensity of the two pulses at energies above 4 kev , a property which may be related to the hard power - law component in the spectra of axps which is probably not existent in xdins .",
    "it is worth noting here , that like many other classes of x - ray pulsars also xdins apparently can exhibit double - peaked profiles , indicating asymmetries between the two emitting areas .",
    "the x - ray spectra of axps consist of a blackbody component with typical temperatures around 400 to 600 ev , much hotter than those seen in xdins of 50 to 120 ev .",
    "further , no hard emission component similar to the power - law seen from axps has been detected yet from any of the xdins .",
    "this may indicate that axps are younger neutron stars ( which is also supported by associations of some of them with supernova remnants ) with a larger energy reservoir .",
    "the currently favored model for axps is that of magnetars , neutron stars with very strong magnetic fields of 10@xmath10 g and the decay of the field providing the energy .",
    "the question is now how do such magnetars look like after their magnetic field has decayed to @xmath46 g , the value observed from rxj0720.4@xmath163125 . in other words are xdins descendents of axps ?",
    "xdins are far more numerous as we can detect them only in a small volume around the sun ( of a few hundred pc radius ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of 10@xmath47 erg s@xmath5 for axps allow their detection within the whole galaxy . from volume considerations maybe 10@xmath48 more xdins than axps currently exist in the galaxy , a number however highly uncertain because it is not clear how representative the solar neighborhood is in terms of volume density of xdins . a factor of about 100 ( assuming evolutionary time scales of 10@xmath3 and 10@xmath34 years for xdins and axps , respectively , during which we can detect these sources )",
    "could be explained by evolution of axps into xdins .",
    "hence , only 1 - 10% of xdins may be descendents of axps , the majority being born with weaker ( 10@xmath9 g ) magnetic fields .",
    "one such case may be rxj0720.4@xmath163125 , for which no significant magnetic field decay is required to explain its observed spin period history and temperature .",
    "the existence of such objects is naturally expected if one accepts the idea of magnetars with magnetic field strengths above @xmath49 g and a field strength distribution at neutron star birth down to the 10@xmath50 g typically observed from x - ray binary pulsars .",
    "if axps cool down during their evolution , loose their x - ray activity and become xdins , an important question is also why we do not see any isolated neutron star with intermediate temperature of 100400 ev .",
    "ms0317.7@xmath166647 was the first object proposed for an old accreting neutron star on the basis of its soft x - ray spectrum : stocke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) presented a rosat pspc spectrum and derived a blackbody temperature of 180 ev .",
    "the source is located in the field of the nearby galaxy ngc1313 ( and is also called ngc1313 x-2 ) and an interpretation as ultra - luminous x - ray source in ngc1313 could not be excluded .",
    "this latter possibility is now strongly supported by xmm - newton observations of ngc1313 which reveal an additional hard component in the spectrum of x-2 and its similarity to x-1 , another ultra - luminous x - ray source in ngc1313 ( miller et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , the rosat discovered xdins are probably the only xdins we now today .",
    "however , it should be remarked here , that their low temperatures might partly be due to a selection effect .",
    "searches in rosat all - sky survey data were performed among the very softest sources ( haberl et al . , 1998 ) and",
