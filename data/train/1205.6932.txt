    "disentangling the stellar populations of galaxies is important to understanding their evolution and the enhancement of star formation in the universe , since the integrated spectrum of galaxies is sensitive to the mass , age , metallicity , dust and star formation history of their dominant stellar populations . despite this complexity",
    ", the observed optical spectra of galaxies can be accurately reproduced ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ) .",
    "high - quality observational data is paramount to test and improve spectrophotometric models , which are used , in turn , to derive the main properties of high redshift galaxies .",
    "optical lick spectral indices have usually been used in stellar population studies of local galaxies ( worthey & ottaviani 1997 ) , but they have problems due to blended features and various population of galaxies .",
    "near - infrared ( nir , hereafter ) spectroscopy has advantages compared to optical , because red giant branch ( rgb ) stars dominate at @xmath7 m and the wavelength region contains many diagnostic stellar absorption lines ( e.g. , mgi 1.575@xmath3 m , si @xmath8 m , co(6 - 3 ) 1.619@xmath3 m , mgi 1.711@xmath3 m , nai @xmath9 m , cai 2.263@xmath3 m and co(2 - 0 ) bandhead @xmath102.29@xmath3 m ) which can be used as indicators of stellar population in terms of their temperature and/or luminosity .",
    "the contributions of dwarf , giant and supergiant stars can be characterized by different depths of their absorption lines and by different shapes of their nir continuum ( e.g. lanon et  al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "much of the work at nir wavelengths has focused on unusual objects with either active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or very strong star formation activity .",
    "these surveys include those of luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( goldader et  al .",
    "1997 ; burston , ward , & davies 2001 ; dannerbauer et  al .",
    "2005 ) , various types of starbursts ( engelbracht et  al .",
    "1998 ; vanzi & rieke 1997 ; coziol , doyon , & demers 2001 ; reunanen , tacconi - garman & ivanov 2007 ) , seyfert galaxies ( ivanov et  al . 2000 ; reunanen , kotilainen , & prieto 2002,2003 ; riffel et  al .",
    "2009 ) liners ( larkin et  al . 1998 ; alonso - herrero et  al . 2000 ) , and ellipticals ( silva et  al .",
    "2008 ; cesetti et  al .",
    "however , relatively little nir spectroscopy exists for inactive nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "such surveys are necessary , though , for understanding their star formation histories , and for setting a baseline for the nir emission from inactive spiral galaxies . without such a baseline",
    ", the contribution of quiescent stellar populations to nir emission in more exotic systems like ultraluminous infrared galaxies and starbursts will remain unknown .",
    "the two largest previous nir spectroscopic studies of inactive spirals were performed by mannucci et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) and bendo & joseph ( 2004 ) .",
    "mannucci et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) studied 28 galaxies with a 7 x 53 arcsec aperture and r = 400 - 500 .",
    "generally , they found a high degree of uniformity for the spectra of spirals ( earlier types being more homogeneous ) but their study was hampered by the low spectral resolution which prevented them from detecting faint and/or blended lines .",
    "more recently , bendo & joseph ( 2004 ) studied 41 galaxies in the k - band and 20 galaxies in the h - band , with slightly higher spectral resolution r = 8001200 .",
    "they extracted spectra from 30@xmath1115arcsec apertures , and found that in almost all cases evolved red stars completely dominate the nuclear stellar populations , while young stars were virtually non - existent .",
    "we stress , however , that both these studies suffer from poor spatial resolution , leading to a possible mix of bulge and disk stellar populations .",
    "to improve this situation , we present in this work nir spectroscopy of nearby inactive spiral galaxies along the hubble sequence , to study their stellar population content and sf histories .",
    "stellar emission and absorption features can probe with great detail the age and sf properties of the stellar population in the nucleus and as a function of radius .",
    "comparison of these properties along the hubble sequence of spirals will assess any relationship of sf with hubble stage .",
    "we present nir spectroscopy for a sample of 29 nearby ( @xmath2 ) spirals with reasonable spatial resolution ( @xmath121 kpc / arcsec ) and medium spectral resolution ( @xmath13600 ) to study the nir properties and ages of their stellar populations . except for a few individual sources , these are the first medium resolution nir spectra of a sizable sample of low redshift spirals .",
    "long - slit spectra of the spirals are extracted across the nucleus to detect all the important diagnostic absorption lines , and emission from the galaxies can usually be studied to large distance from the nucleus . our aim is to study the stellar population of spirals based on the nir stellar absorption indices , and to inter - compare these indices within the different morphology types .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section[sec : sample ] we describe the sample selection , observations , data reduction and methods of analysis .",
    "in section[sec : results ] , we present the results and discussion concerning the properties of the galaxies , and the composite quiescent spectra , and in section[sec : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions based on the full sample of 29 spiral galaxies . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a concordance cosmology with @xmath14 = 70 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 = 0.3 and @xmath17 = 0.7 .",
    "this project started as a followup to our nir spectroscopy of seyfert galaxies ( reunanen et  al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "we created a comparison sample of non - active spiral galaxies that were matched in hubble type with our sample of seyferts .",
    "we selected in each hubble type from e to sc a similar number of nearby bright galaxies ( z @xmath18 0.01 ; m(k ) @xmath18 11 to keep the exposure time reasonable to reach the required s / n ) and paid careful attention that the spiral galaxies had no indication of nuclear or peculiar activity , based on their multiwavelength properties , especially from optical spectroscopy , radio and x - ray data .",
    "we planned to observe five galaxies for each hubble type between e and sc , in order to obtain a good estimate of the intrinsic spread in the spectra of each class , to remove possible individual peculiar characteristics .",
    "although our sample is not complete , we consider it as representative of the class of nearby spiral galaxies , and an improvement over the samples in mannucci et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and bendo & joseph ( 2004 ) .",
    "the h- and k - band spectroscopic observations of the spirals were carried out in february 2002 and march 2006 at the 3.5 m eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) using the 1024@xmath111024 px sofi camera and spectrograph ( moorwood et  al . 1998 ) with pixel scale 0.288 arcsec pix@xmath15 .",
    "the average seeing during the observations was @xmath120.7 @xmath19 fwhm .",
    "the medium resolution ( @xmath13600 ) long - slit @xmath6-band spectra were taken along the major axis of the galaxies and across the nucleus , with the red grism and slit width 1.0 arcsec .",
    "the wavelength range of the spectra is from 1.5 to 2.5@xmath3 m and the useful slit length @xmath122@xmath20 .",
    "the spectra of each target were taken with pairs using abba observing cycle of alternating galaxy and sky exposures nodding @xmath12 60 arcsec along the slit , and slightly moving the target position in the slit between exposures , with total integration time of 48 minutes ( except 32 minutes for ngc 5612 ) , divided into individual exposures of 60 s.    a literature search was carried out to collect previous measurements of the galaxies in our sample : intrinsic velocity dispersion @xmath21 , and optical spectral indices mg@xmath22 and h@xmath23 in the lick system ( e.g. , targer et  al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",

    "( 2008 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the ews is limited by the uncertain continuum level in the vicinity of the particular line rather than the s / n of the spectra .",
    "this is especially true for the @xmath0-band which is rich in spectral features , and for the co(2 - 0 ) bandhead in the @xmath1-band because the continuum level has to be extrapolated longward of 2.295@xmath3 m .",
    "it is worth to keep in mind , that there are many blends and broad molecular features ( wallace & hinkle 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , the measured ews of the indices are evidently upper limits due to spreading caused by velocity dispersion .",
    "the possible dependence of the ews on velocity dispersion and resolution was checked by degrading the medium resolution stellar spectra from wallace & hinkle ( 1997 ) to the lower resolution applicable for the spiral galaxy sample , and measuring the indices of all the five diagnostic features for both resolutions .",
    "this comparison showed that the indices do not significantly depend on the degradation : all measurements agree within the errors .",
    "therefore , the bandpasses are wide enough to fully encompass the measured features , despite the broadening due to the intrinsic velocity dispersion .",
    "we estimate our typical ew errors to be : @xmath120.5 @xmath26 for the @xmath0-band and for the @xmath1-band metallic lines , and @xmath121.0 @xmath26 for the @xmath1-band co(2 - 0 ) feature .",

    "most of the off - nuclear spirals are in good agreement with the relation of giant ( iii ) stars , while ellipticals deviate more strongly from that relation .",

    "[ ewt ] , bottom right panel .",
    "the sii line is slightly overestimated , because it is contaminated , mainly by co , due to the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the galaxies , together with the medium - resolution of our spectra . in conclusion , the majority of spirals are closer to giants and supergiants than the ellipticals , demonstrating the difference in their stellar populations .    almost all spirals and ellipticals have ew(co 2.29 ) @xmath10 15 @xmath26 which is larger than the ew of k giants ( from 10 @xmath26 to 15 @xmath26 ) or main sequence stars .",

    "these spectra therefore find applications as template spectra for the underlying galaxy which can be subtracted from the spectra of composite stellar systems ( e.g. agn host galaxies ) .        to construct the quiescent template spectra , we divided the sample into six groups according to their hubble type .",

    "( 2001 ) and bendo & joseph ( 2004 ) , and supports the paradigm that the relative strength of star formation increases along the hubble sequence , probably reflecting the change along the hubble sequence in the relative dominance of bulge stars to the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band emission .",
    "galaxies ic 4214 , ngc 2196 , ngc 2775 , ngc 3715 , ngc 3892 and ngc 5806 exhibit br@xmath27 line but nondetectable h@xmath22 line .",
    "the recombination line indicates that young ionizing stars are present , but the lack of shock excitation lines suggests that the stellar population has not evolved to a point where supernovae are generating shocks in the interstellar medium .",
    "therefore , using starburst99 models ( leitherer et  al .",
    "1999 ) , the stellar population must be less than 3.5  myr old . on the other hand , ngc 5612 exhibits h@xmath22 line from shock excitation but very weak or nonexistent br@xmath27 emission .",
    "the absence of strong recombination lines indicates that they have at least evolved past 8  myr .",
    "if the shock excitation lines are interpreted as originating from supernovae , then we conclude that the stellar populations in these galaxies are in the 8 - 36  myr age range .",
    "we have presented medium resolution nir @xmath6-band spectra of a sizable sample of low redshift inactive spiral galaxies , to study their stellar populations along the hubble sequence , based on the diagnostic stellar absorption lines .",
    "our main results are : ( i ) the ews of the sii , co(1.62 ) nai , cai and co(2.29 ) features in the spirals are most consistent with those of giant stars , whereas ellipticals ( from literature ) show a contribution from main sequence dwarf stars , and on average , ew(co2.29 ) of spirals is somewhat greater than that of ellipticals .",
    "most likely , the ews are not significantly affected by non - stellar dilution .",
    "( ii ) overall , evolved red stars completely dominate the nir spectra , while contribution from hot young stars is virtually nonexistent .",
    "( iii ) we produce high spatial resolution nir @xmath6-band template spectra for spirals along the hubble sequence , that will form a baseline for comparison to galaxies with more exotic star formation or agn activity .",
