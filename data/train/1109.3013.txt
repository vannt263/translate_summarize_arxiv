    "the action @xmath190 by @xmath191 , a useful regulator term for the zero - dimensional @xmath0 vector model is @xmath192 this term effectively replaces the parameter @xmath3 in the action by @xmath193 . subtracting a similar mass term from the flowing generating functional of one - particle irreducible vertices , @xmath194 this effective average action satisfies the initial condition @xmath195 ultimately , we are interested in the problem without the artificial regulator term .",
    "it is the aim of the frg to follow the flow of various couplings as this regulator term is gradually removed . for @xmath196",
    "we then obtain @xmath197    as shown by wetterich and others @xcite , the effective average action obeys the following flow equation , @xmath198 \\left ( { \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\vec{\\phi } } } \\otimes { \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\vec{\\phi}}}\\:{\\gamma_{\\lambda}}(\\vec{\\phi } )      + \\mathbf{r}_\\lambda \\right)^{-1 } \\right ] \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath199 is just @xmath200 times the unit matrix and @xmath201 if we are also interested in the interaction - induced shift of the free energy , @xmath82 , we have to subtract from the r.h.s .  of eq .   the same term with @xmath9 set equal to zero .",
    "one way of solving eq .   is to expand both sides of this equation with respect to the fields and compare their coefficients to derive flow equations for the expansion coefficients of @xmath202 .",
    "this is the so - called _",
    "vertex expansion_. proceeding along this way , one obtains a system of infinitely many coupled ordinary differential equations , of which we list the first four , @xmath203 here , @xmath204 is the flowing propagator and @xmath205 is the corresponding non - interacting propagator . graphical representations of these flow equations are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow_equations ] .",
    "-point vertices @xmath206 are denoted by filled circles with @xmath1 external legs and the derivative with respect to @xmath207 is denoted by a dot , the flowing propagator @xmath208 is represented by a thick line . the cross appearing exactly once in every graph on the r.h.s",
    ".  simply denotes the derivative of the regulator @xmath200 with respect to @xmath207 . ]",
    "we _ truncate _ our vertex expansion by setting all vertices higher than a given order @xmath209 equal to their initial values .",
    "choosing @xmath210 , the resulting system of ordinary differential equations consists of very few equations and can easily be solved numerically .",
    "as the couplings @xmath79 with @xmath211 are completely decoupled from @xmath82 , we do not need to keep track of the latter if we are not interested in the flow of the interaction - induced shift of the free energy .",
    "even when truncating the system of flow equations at @xmath212 we therefore only need to consider three flowing couplings . according to eq .  , our initial values for the @xmath213 are @xmath214 to numerically integrate our set of flow equations , we use the following regulator , @xmath215 which leads to @xmath216 , @xmath217 , and @xmath218 . for @xmath81 , the resulting equations agree with refs .  meden03,kopietz10 .",
    "since @xmath200 diverges for @xmath219 and vanishes for @xmath220 , our flow equations have to be integrated from @xmath221 to @xmath222 . as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : gamma2_n1][fig : gamma4_n2 ] , the values obtained by setting @xmath212 already turn out to be very close to the exact result and thereby reduce the possible benefit that could be gained by including higher orders .     for @xmath223 and @xmath20 [ upper ( red ) curves ] as well as @xmath223 and @xmath224 [ lower ( blue ) curves ] .",
    "it should be observed that the final ( physical ) curve with @xmath225 always has a single - valued minimum located at @xmath226 , owing to the fact that there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking in a system of finite ( or even zero ) volume . ]",
    "so far , we have restricted our discussion of the zero - dimensional @xmath0 vector model to the case of positive @xmath3 .",
    "while the perturbative approach is only meaningful for such values of @xmath3 , the large-@xmath2 expansion and the frg study can readily be generalised to negative @xmath3 . for the large-@xmath2 expansion we note that for general @xmath3 the minimum of @xmath136 is located at @xmath227 , which for negative @xmath3 leads to slight modifications of all equations . as concerns the ( frg ) vertex expansion ,",
    "the extension to negative @xmath3 is possible by expanding the effective average action @xmath228 around its flowing minimum .    besides the vertex expansion",
    ", the derivative expansion is a powerful approximation for the frg . within this approximation ,",
    "terms of arbitrary order are kept for a homogeneous field configuration .",
    "as there are no spatial variations in a zero - dimensional field theory , the derivative approximation actually becomes an exact method to solve the zero - dimensional @xmath0 vector model . because @xmath229 is only a function of @xmath230 , it is customary to define @xmath231 and introduce the flowing effective potential as @xmath232 . using @xmath233 and letting @xmath234 point along one of the coordinate axes , we have @xmath235 \\left ( { \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\vec{\\phi } } } \\otimes { \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\vec{\\phi}}}\\:u_\\lambda(\\rho )      + \\mathbf{r}_\\lambda \\right)^{-1 } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\        & \\quad = \\frac{{\\partial_{\\lambda}}r_{\\lambda}}{2 } \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left ( \\frac{\\partial^2 u_\\lambda}{\\partial \\phi_i^2 }      + r_{\\lambda } \\right)^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\        & \\quad = \\frac{{\\partial_{\\lambda}}r_{\\lambda}}{2 } \\left ( \\frac{1}{u_\\lambda^\\prime(\\rho ) + 2 \\rho u_\\lambda^{\\prime\\prime } ( \\rho )   + r_{\\lambda } }   + \\frac{n-1}{u_\\lambda^\\prime(\\rho )   + r_{\\lambda } } \\right ) \\;. \\label{flow_eq_wetterich_simplified }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] defining @xmath236 as the expansion coefficients of @xmath237 as in @xmath238 one can compare the series of @xmath237 and @xmath239 , @xmath240 to find that @xmath241 solving the partial differential equation for @xmath237 by discretising @xmath242 , we obtain results which are very close to the exact result .",
    "we can then use eq .   to obtain the vertex functions that we were initially interested in . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_full_both ] we show the evolution of the effective potential @xmath237 for both a positive and a negative value of @xmath3 .",
    "this evolution is especially interesting for negative @xmath3 . at the beginning of the frg flow ,",
    "all fluctuations are excluded , such that the minimum of the effective average potential is located at a finite value of @xmath242 .",
    "neglecting fluctuations would therefore lead ( as in mean - field theory ) to a symmetry - broken state by picking one vector @xmath234 which satisfies @xmath243 .",
    "but we do have to include fluctuations , and this is what the frg does .",
    "as all fluctuations are integrated out , the minimum of @xmath244 is moved to @xmath226 , giving rise to a single , non - degenerate ground state with @xmath245 .",
    "this result is a natural consequence of the fact that there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking in any system of finite ( including zero ) size .",
    "let us also note that the effective potential becomes a convex function of @xmath234 , as one should expect for a function whose origin lies in a legendre transformation .",
    "it is impossible to recover this feature within the vertex expansion .",
    "in order to conclude our comparison of different approaches to the zero - dimensional @xmath0 vector model , let us come back to the plots in figs .",
    "[ fig : gamma2_n1][fig : gamma4_n2 ] .",
    "the most obvious fact to observe is that perturbation theory consistently breaks down for @xmath246 ( or , more accurately , for @xmath247 if @xmath248 ) .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen that including higher orders of the expansion parameter @xmath9 only exacerbates the situation in the strong coupling regime ",
    "exactly the behaviour one would expect from an asymptotic series whose contributions have alternating signs .    moving on",
    ", we see that when including the first two subleading orders of the self - energy @xmath83 , the large-@xmath2 expansion makes surprisingly good predictions for @xmath26 and even @xmath81 .",
    "however , the large-@xmath2 expansion fails for the calculation of the four - point vertex @xmath84 for both @xmath81 and @xmath26 , and one needs to go to much larger values of @xmath2 ( or very small values of @xmath186 ) to see an asymptotic convergence . as concerns more involved model systems , terms of order @xmath249 are usually very difficult to compute , and it is widely known that the large-@xmath2 expansion can fail , as it does for instance for half - odd integer spin antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "last of all , let us come back to the frg results . within the vertex expansion , one truncates the system of flow equations at a given order and including more terms in this expansion consistently improves this result . as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : gamma0_n2][fig : gamma4_n2 ] , for the results with @xmath212 ( keeping all vertices up to the six - point vertex ) it becomes difficult to distinguish the frg results from the exact values no matter how large the interaction strength @xmath21 is .",
    "as higher - order vertices are more directly affected by our truncations , the results decrease in their precision when going to higher - order vertices . despite of that",
    ", one can clearly see that the frg outperforms the other approaches with only three running couplings .",
    "for the zero - dimensional @xmath0 vector model considered here , the frg flow equation can directly be solved using numerical methods .",
    "this is not possible in higher dimensions , as the space of possible functions @xmath250 becomes just too big @xcite .",
    "however , keeping in a derivative expansion in addition to the effective potential @xmath244 just the derivative term as already present in the action of a @xmath251 theory leads to a very useful approximation , the local potential approximation ( lpa ) @xcite .",
    "it then turns out , that while the effective action is still convex , its minimum is not single - valued .",
    "instead , one obtains a flat plateau , giving rise to spontaneous symmetry breaking .    summing up",
    ", we find that perturbation theory only works for small values of @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",
    "both the large-@xmath2 expansion and the functional renormalisation group can be used to explore non - perturbative aspects of our field theory . however , as the large-@xmath2 expansion fails to determine the four - point vertex for @xmath252 or @xmath253 , the frg turns out to be most reliable for small @xmath2 .",

    "in this appendix we collect some results for perturbation theory up to sixth order and also give the next - to - next leading order results of the one - particle irreducible @xmath1-point vertices in the large-@xmath2 expansion for @xmath254 .",
