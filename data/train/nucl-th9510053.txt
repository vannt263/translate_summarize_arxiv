    "current deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments at hera are probing the structure of the nucleon at ever smaller values of the bjorken @xmath0 variable ( @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath1 and @xmath6 the squared four - momentum and energy transfer to the nucleon .",
    "the large range of @xmath1 available ( @xmath7 gev@xmath3 ) allows for quantitative tests of the nature of the evolution of structure functions at these low @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "one reason why the small @xmath0 region is interesting is that it is here that large distance phenomena become relevant , which offers the unique prospect of learning more about the nucleon s non - perturbative structure in dis .",
    "before we can fully appreciate the long range structure of the nucleon , there is of course the non - perturbative region at moderate @xmath0 , but smaller @xmath1 ( @xmath8 gev@xmath3 ) , which has been the focus of many previous studies , but which still requires quantitative understanding .",
    "the significance of this kinematic region is that it reflects precisely the transition between the perturbative and non - perturbative domains of qcd , namely the interface between the parton picture of the nucleon , and the familiar valence quark models of hadrons which successfully describe much of the low - energy phenomenology .",
    "this connection has previously been investigated within phenomenological models of the nucleon , such as bag or non - relativistic quark models @xcite . while these efforts have produced some encouraging results , some problems remain , however , in bridging the gap between leading - twist quark distributions calculated within such models , and the experimental structure function data .",
    "one problem encountered in most of these approaches has been their failure to correctly describe the @xmath9 behavior of valence quark distributions @xcite .",
    "this is intrinsically related to the common approximation made in identifying the non - interacting quark system , which is formally on - mass - shell and remains spectator to the deep inelastic collision of the probe with the interacting quark , with a simple diquark , of mass @xmath10 .",
    "a consequence of this assumption is that to ensure correct normalization , the calculated valence quark distribution must be evolved from extremely low resolution scales , @xmath11 0.10.3 gev@xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath12 13 . at these scales",
    "the use of perturbative qcd is rather questionable , and it s not even clear whether adding next - to - leading - order corrections @xcite is a sensible solution @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will address the question of whether , and under what conditions , can the inclusion of higher mass spectator states generate sufficiently soft contributions to the valence quark densities so as to allow reliable descriptions of the data when evolved from a scale @xmath13 gev@xmath3 , where perturbative qcd can be used with some more justification .",
    "our physical framework is assumed to be as follows . at a scale @xmath13 gev@xmath3",
    "it will be natural to view the nucleon as composed of constituent quark ( cq ) `` quasi - particles '' , which for our purposes will mean quarks having the quantum numbers of qcd ( current ) quarks , but which acquire a large average mass , @xmath14 , due to their strong non - perturbative interactions . since this scale is also",
    "typically that associated with chiral symmetry breaking , pseudoscalar goldstone bosons ( pions ) will in addition play a role .",
    "we will therefore assume that the structure of the nucleon seen by a virtual photon with @xmath13 gev@xmath3 is incorporated within the substructure of the cqs themselves and their pion dressing .",
    "in addition to knowing the internal structure of cqs , one also needs to describe the interaction between cqs in the nucleon , which we parametrize in terms of a relativistic quark ",
    "nucleon vertex function .",
    "we should state that our aim here is not to calculate the vertex function directly , and it will suffice to adopt a parametrization based on a physically motivated ansatz .",
    "our main aim will be to model the spectral function which describes the non - interacting , spectator quark system , in terms of the degrees of freedom available to us at @xmath13 gev@xmath3 , namely cqs and pions . within our framework the task of describing the recoil spectator spectrum of the nucleon is reduced to detailing the remnant recoil system that remains after the interaction with the cq .    the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sss ] we introduce our model for the spectral function of the spectator quark system . in section [ ia ]",
    "we discuss the cq momentum distribution in the nucleon and the low mass spectator spectrum , which gives the leading contribution to the nucleon structure function at large @xmath0 .",
    "the intermediate mass contributions , which are modeled by dressing the cqs by pions , are described in section [ cloud ] .",
    "also discussed is the small-@xmath0 region of the quark distributions , for which we use a simple model based on regge phenomenology to describe the large spectator mass continuum contribution to the spectral function .",
    "finally , in section [ finita ] we discuss our numerical results and draw conclusions .",
    "in this section we outline the basic reasoning behind the need for a detailed description of the spectrum of states that are spectator to the interaction of the photon with a quark in the nucleon ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "let us begin the discussion with the familiar hadronic tensor @xmath15 which describes deep - inelastic scattering of a virtual photon ( momentum @xmath16 ) from a nucleon target ( momentum @xmath17 ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the electromagnetic current operator , and the states are normalized such that @xmath20 .",
    "for unpolarized scattering , which we consider throughout this paper , @xmath15 is usually decomposed into two independent structures : @xmath21 where the structure functions @xmath22 are expressed as functions of @xmath0 and @xmath23 . in the parton model",
    "@xmath22 become independent of @xmath1 ( at leading order in @xmath24 ) , and are related via : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 gives the probability to find a quark @xmath16 in the nucleon .    in the usual treatment of inclusive dis from a nucleon one",
    "formally sums over the complete set of intermediate states , which are labeled @xmath27 in fig.1 , that are spectator to the deep - inelastic collision . in order to reliably calculate structure functions for all @xmath28 one needs to know the spectator quark spectrum in its entirety , including the contributions from the large spectator masses . in practice",
    "this is quite a challenge to any theoretical approach , and commonly one resorts to approximations which are , however , often valid only in a limited range of @xmath0 @xcite .    to elucidate the connection between the quark distribution @xmath26 , calculated at some scale @xmath29 , and the spectator state @xmath27",
    ", we can use the so - called dispersion representation of the quark distribution @xcite . here",
    "@xmath26 is expressed in terms of the probability density , @xmath30 , of the quark spectator states with invariant mass @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the four - momentum of the struck quark , and @xmath34 is the kinematical maximum of the quark virtuality @xmath35 for given @xmath0 and @xmath36 . in terms of the amplitude @xmath37 describing the absorption of a virtual photon by a quark with momentum @xmath38 ,",
    "this can be written as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the invariant mass of the intermediate spectator state @xmath27 , and where formally the amplitude @xmath41 is defined via the matrix elements of the quark field operator at the origin @xmath42:@xmath43 .",
    "an expression similar to ( [ qrho ] ) holds also for the antiquark distribution @xmath44 .    the dispersion representation in eq.([qrho ] ) is valid as long as the integrals are convergent",
    ". therefore it is generally assumed that the spectral density vanishes at large quark virtualities @xmath35 , and that the integration is dominated by contributions from the region of finite @xmath35 , @xmath45 @xcite . then from eq.([p2max ] ) one sees that the smaller the @xmath0 , the broader the region of @xmath36 from which @xmath26 receives contributions . for large @xmath0 ( @xmath46 ) ,",
    "the region of finite @xmath47 is of major importance , and here one can expect models with low - mass spectators , such as diquarks , to be a good approximation . on the other hand , at small @xmath0 the quark virtuality",
    "@xmath35 is finite even for large @xmath48 .",
    "therefore the quark distribution in eq.([qrho ] ) is sensitive to the high - energy part of the spectrum .",
    "the physical origin of the large-@xmath36 region of the spectator quark spectrum is the high - energy scattering of the virtual @xmath49 component of the photon from the nucleon .",
    "this can be seen by recalling that the quark field operator acting on the target state can either annihilate a quark or create an antiquark in the target . in the former case",
    "the matrix element @xmath50 describes the absorption of a virtual photon by quarks with momentum @xmath38 , which results in a finite spectrum of intermediate states . on the other hand",
    ", the contribution from the antiquark part of the field operator , @xmath51 , describes the `` external '' antiquarks from @xmath49 fluctuations of the virtual photon and their interaction with the nucleon .",
    "the possible antiquark momenta @xmath38 are determined by the wave function of the photon and can be as large as the photon momentum @xmath52 , leading to a large invariant mass of the antiquark  nucleon system , @xmath53 .",
    "the modeling of the spectral function @xmath54 must of course reflect the resolution scale at which the target nucleon is probed .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we will consider @xmath30 at a fixed scale of order @xmath55 gev@xmath3 . at this model scale ,",
    "constituent quarks are perhaps the most useful effective degrees of freedom . in a constituent quark picture",
    ", the resolution scale can be associated with some average size , @xmath56 , of the cq : @xmath57 .",
    "results for the color correlation function on a lattice @xcite indicate that color fields are confined to a distance of order 0.2 fm .",
    "this should also apply to each cq , and one is led to the estimate @xmath58 gev@xmath3 .",
    "naturally , at some other scale , cqs may not be the best variables with which to describe the spectral function .",
    "however , at @xmath58 gev@xmath3 , it is known from many other applications that cqs give a good description of the nucleon s dynamical properties , such as electromagnetic form factors . a natural question to ask therefore",
    "is whether cqs can be useful tools in describing dis from the nucleon , fig.2 .    within this picture",
    ", it will be convenient to break up the spectrum of all possible spectator states into several mass regions , which we now summarize .",
    "@xmath59 ( @xmath60):in a cq picture , the simplest approximation is to identify the spectator system which remains after one cq is removed with a single diquark , with some relatively low mass , @xmath61 , fig.3(a ) . the low-@xmath36 part ( @xmath62 gev@xmath3 ) of the spectral function",
    "can then be approximated by : @xmath63 where the function @xmath64 , which is now independent of @xmath36 , is identified with the distribution of constituent quarks in the nucleon with a fraction of the nucleon light - cone momentum @xmath0 and the invariant mass squared @xmath35 ( see eq.([fdef ] ) below ) ( we omit explicit reference to the scale @xmath58 gev@xmath3 from now on ) . in a relativistic treatment , @xmath65 is best described in terms of relativistic quark  diquark  nucleon ( @xmath66 ) vertex functions .",
    "simple effective models , with constituent quarks as basic ingredients , can be used to calculate the vertex function directly .",
    "note that such calculations are only feasible if the complexity of the task is reduced to that of a few body problem .",
    "in other models , where the struck quark is treated as a current quark , the spectator state would have to be very complicated , making even an approximate model solution for the vertex function beyond our present technical ability .",
    "therefore if the spectator state is to be treated as a diquark , then in order to solve for the relativistic vertex function , the struck quark must be a constituent quark .",
    "@xmath59 ( @xmath67):to model the intermediate - mass part ( 1 gev@xmath3 @xmath68 ) of the spectral function requires going beyond the simplest , single - spectator diquark approximation for the intermediate state .",
    "one approach would be to consider higher - fock state components containing a diquark plus some number of @xmath49 pairs as spectators . within the bag model calculations of ref.@xcite , for example",
    ", these component were modeled in terms of the insertion of an antiquark ( or quark ) , produced from the incoming virtual photon , into the nucleon initial state , which then produced intermediate states with masses of order @xmath69 .    at a scale @xmath13 gev@xmath3 , as well as constituent quarks , pseudoscalar goldstone bosons  pions  also enter as natural degrees of freedom in any effective model description . in a constituent quark picture , therefore , it will be more convenient to model these components in terms of the dressing of cqs by pions , as illustrated for example in fig.3(b ) . in practice",
    "we restrict ourselves only the one - pion contributions .",
    "one could , in principle , continue the series in the pion number @xmath27 to large @xmath27 , hoping to describe the large-@xmath36 region entirely in terms of pion ladder diagrams .",
    "however , taking this route would necessarily mean eventually including dressing due to the heavier meson spectators , as well as from diquarks .",
    "a more efficient approach will be to truncate the series at some mass @xmath70 ( which we take to be @xmath71 gev@xmath3 ) , and describe the large - mass contributions in terms of multi - quark and gluon configurations .",
    "@xmath59 ( @xmath72):to model the large ( including asymptotic ) mass tail of intermediate states ( @xmath73 gev@xmath3 ) , we describe the amplitude for scattering a @xmath49 pair from a cq within regge theory , which effectively takes into account an infinite set of ladders involving @xmath49 pairs in the intermediate state , fig.3(c ) . the exchange of a regge trajectory with the intercept @xmath74 leads to imaginary parts of amplitudes rising with energy as @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "this energy dependence of the scattering amplitude then gives rise to valence quark distributions which rise at small @xmath0 as @xmath76 .    within the above framework ,",
    "all three processes @xmath60@xmath72 will be described in terms of cq parameters , with the basic common unit being the relativistic @xmath66 vertex function .",
    "that is , the constituent quark ",
    "nucleon interaction is factored out from the hard scattering of the photon with the interacting quark . in the impulse approximation , nucleon dis",
    "can then be viewed as a two - step process , in terms of photon  cq , and cq  nucleon subprocesses @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , however , special care has to be given to the fact that the cq is bound , and thus off - mass - shell .",
    "at the relatively low momentum scales at which a constituent quark model may be relevant , higher twists ( i.e. @xmath77 corrections to scaling quark distributions ) are bound to play an important role .",
    "the final aim , however , is to compare the calculated structure functions with dis data at large @xmath1 ( @xmath78 gev@xmath3 ) , where higher - twist effects should be negligible . therefore it will be sufficient to consider only the leading twist components of the structure function , represented by the `` handbag '' diagram in fig.1 . at leading twist , the fields that appear in the formal expressions for the current commutators in the forward virtual compton scattering amplitude are those of point - like , elementary ( i.e. current ) quarks . in a constituent quark picture , however , the propagator of the quark before it is struck is modeled to be that of a quark with mass @xmath14 ( while the propagating high - momentum quark after the interaction with the photon is a current quark ) .",
    "if one attempts to work with effective , composite degrees of freedom in dis , a clear and well - defined connection must therefore exist between current and constituent quarks , in particular with respect to the nature of the photon ",
    "cq vertex .",
    "an example of a simple dynamical model in which such a link exists is the nambu & jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite . here",
    "low - momentum gluons are integrated out and absorbed into a local , point - like interaction between quarks , characterized by an effective coupling constant .",
    "( explicit perturbative gluonic degrees of freedom reappear when the calculated quark distributions are evolved to the higher @xmath1 appropriate for the dis region . )",
    "the mechanisms used in going from current to constituent quarks are dynamical quark mass generation , involving the scalar interaction of the quark with the dirac vacuum , together with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "the connection between current and constituent quark masses is formally quantified via a `` gap equation '' @xcite . through interactions with quark condensates , ( nearly )",
    "massless current quarks acquire large constituent masses , of order @xmath79 400 mev .",
    "( for detailed reviews of the njl approach see refs.@xcite . )    within this approach a cq mass therefore appears in the quark propagator , while one still has a simple @xmath80 coupling at the photon ",
    "quark vertex .",
    "there is no form factor suppression at large @xmath1 arising from the photon ",
    "cq  current quark vertex . in a relativistic cq picture , such as",
    "that embodied in the njl model , the diagrams responsible for the cq form factor are those in which the photon couples to the target cq via @xmath81 loops . as @xmath82 these rapidly die out , leaving behind only the scaling part associated with the direct coupling of the photon to the cq . in this way",
    "the only difference between scattering from current and constituent quarks is therefore a renormalization of the quark mass .",
    "the dressing of the struck quark propagator is not included , since this would correspond to higher twist corrections .",
    "having made these remarks , we now turn to the calculation of constituent quark distributions inside the nucleon .",
    "constituent quarks embedded in a nucleon have some characteristic momentum distribution , which is essentially given by the cq wave function . within the present approach it",
    "is more conveniently expressed in terms of the relativistic quark  diquark  nucleon vertex functions , @xmath83 ( proportional to the product of the wave function and the quark propagator ) , connecting the nucleon and off - shell quark to the non - interacting ( spectator ) intermediate state diquark .    in the impulse approximation ( i.e. no final state interactions between the struck quark and the residual diquark system ) the cq distribution ( see eq.([rhoa ] ) ) can be written : @xmath84,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the fraction of light - cone momentum of the nucleon carried by the cq , and the operator @xmath86 describes the soft cq ",
    "nucleon interaction .",
    "the label @xmath87 refers to the possible spin orientations of the spectator state ( @xmath88 or 1 ) , since any realistic model of the nucleon must incorporate pseudovector as well as scalar diquarks . in terms of the propagators and @xmath66 vertex functions ,",
    "@xmath86 is defined as :    [ hdef ] @xmath89 for a scalar ( @xmath88 ) spectator system , and : @xmath90    for @xmath91 spectators . here",
    "@xmath92 is the cq mass , and the conjugate vertex is defined as@xmath93 .    the trace in eq.([fdef ] )",
    "can be separated into terms proportional to the four - momenta @xmath94 and @xmath95 : @xmath96 & = & f^{(s)}_1(p^2)\\ , p_\\mu\\   + \\ f^{(s)}_2(p^2)\\ , p_\\mu , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath97 and @xmath98 can be calculated from the @xmath66 vertex . in terms of @xmath99 , the constituent quark distribution function @xmath100 is given by : @xmath101 note that in general the functions @xmath99 depend on @xmath35 as well as @xmath102 , however the latter is fixed by the @xmath103-function in eq.([fdef ] ) : @xmath104 .",
    "different @xmath88 and @xmath91 vertices , as well as a larger pseudovector diquark mass ( @xmath105 gev ) , are needed to explicitly break spin - flavor su(4 ) symmetry , which is reflected in a softer @xmath106 quark distribution compared with the @xmath107 quark distribution @xcite .",
    "the complete dirac structure for the vertex @xmath108 can be written down in terms of a number of independent functions .",
    "in particular , one has for the @xmath88 vertex : @xmath109 and similarly for the @xmath91 case : @xmath110 although different bases in which to expand @xmath108 can of course be chosen @xcite .    in most previous calculations of structure functions involving @xmath66 vertices @xcite",
    "the momentum dependence in @xmath108 has not been calculated directly , but rather has had to be parametrized , by appealing to dis data to fix parameters .",
    "the approach adopted has been to choose a single form for both the @xmath88 and @xmath91 vertices , and adjust the momentum dependence in each , to effectively compensate for the omission of the other structures .",
    "for example , by choosing different shapes for the functions @xmath111 , one can get similar results whether one uses a structure @xmath112 @xcite or one proportional to @xmath113 ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "although the phenomenological approach has been successful in allowing fair descriptions of the nucleon s valence quark distributions , it is naturally desirable to have stronger theoretical justification for using any particular vertex structure .",
    "recently attempts have been made to calculate @xmath108 within effective models , notably the njl model .",
    "here we outline the general approaches used in these calculations  for more details see refs.@xcite .",
    "the simplest ansatz has been to reduce the relativistic three - body calculation to a more tractable , effective two - body problem , by treating the nucleon as a composite of a quark and an elementary diquark @xcite . within this approximation",
    "one can solve exactly the bethe - salpeter equation for the quark ",
    "diquark system using a static approximation for the ( local ) quark exchange interaction .    beyond this simplest approximation ,",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation has more recently been solved for the case where the exchanged quark was allowed to propagate between the quark and diquark @xcite .",
    "ishii et al .",
    "@xcite and huang and tjon @xcite have gone further by finding solutions to the covariant faddeev equation without imposing the constraint that the diquark be elementary .",
    "although only @xmath88 diquarks were modeled in refs.@xcite , the authors of refs.@xcite have also incorporated pseudovector diquarks in their models for @xmath114 .",
    "note that to describe dis one only needs the vertex function with an on - shell diquark  solutions to the bethe - salpeter or faddeev equations more generally have both the quark and diquark off their mass shells .",
    "the results of the model calculations @xcite indicate that the @xmath115-wave vertices give the most important contributions to the norm and to the nucleon s electric charge , which provides some justification for the prescription applied in refs.@xcite of using only the leading structures .",
    "furthermore , they show that the shapes of @xmath116 can be reasonably well approximated by simple monopole or dipole functions : @xmath117 with cut - off parameters @xmath118 of the order of 12 gev ( depending on the precise value of @xmath119 ) .",
    "such results are not surprising if one s model is to reproduce realistic values for the nucleon s static properties , such as the mass and r.m.s . radius .",
    "note the presence of the zero in the numerator in eq.([vfpole ] ) at @xmath120 , which has the role of canceling the quark propagators in @xmath121 . in principle",
    "the quark propagators in eq.([fdef ] ) could develop unphysical poles in the kinematically allowed region if the sum of quark and diquark masses falls below the nucleon mass , meaning that the nucleon could freely disintegrate into its constituents .",
    "as such the form factor in eq.([vfpole ] ) reflects the underlying dynamics that are responsible for the bound state of the nucleon .",
    "similar results have been reported for the quark  antiquark ",
    "meson vertex function in ref.@xcite .",
    "note that @xmath118 is not related to the intrinsic njl cut - off , @xmath122 . by treating scalar or pseudovector diquarks as quasi - particles , with effective boson propagators @xmath123",
    ", one renders all loop integrals appearing in the calculation of the bethe - salpeter amplitudes finite , without any need to introduce ultra - violet cut - offs as regulators .",
    "this can be easily seen by counting inverse powers of momentum running through the quark",
    " diquark legs .",

    "diquark models to see a spectrum of diquark bound states with a range of masses @xcite . by taking into account only the lightest diquark state one necessarily underestimates the average mass of the diquark which would effectively describe the low-@xmath36 part of the spectrum . for comparison",
    ", we also examine the effect on the quark distributions of using smaller masses , @xmath138 gev .    for the @xmath66 form factor ( vertex function ) specifying the distributions @xmath139 we use the form in eq.([vfpole ] ) .",

    "the position of the peak value of @xmath151 depends quite sensitively on the mass of the intermediate state diquark system",
    ". for the smaller diquark masses ( @xmath152 gev ) , the result ( dashed ) is nearly a factor 3 larger , and peaks at a considerably larger value of @xmath0 compared with the data .",
    "the valence quark ratio in the impulse approximation , @xmath153 , shown in fig.4(b ) , exhibits far less dependence on the diquark masses , and gives quite reasonable agreement with the data at large @xmath0 , particularly for the larger mass spectators .    the fact that the impulse approximation is only good at large @xmath0",
    "is clearly reflected in the absence of the correct ( singular ) behavior of @xmath154 as @xmath9 that would be expected from regge phenomenology , namely @xmath155 ( see section iv.b ) . because only small ( finite ) spectator masses",
    "are included in @xmath154 , the calculated distributions are finite at @xmath156 , whereas the experimental distributions diverge .",
    "therefore a large fraction of the normalization has to come from the medium and large-@xmath0 regions to compensate  hence the large peak in @xmath151 .",
    "this fact demonstrates that the distributions @xmath154 alone , calculated in a cq model , are incapable of describing the valence structure function over the entire range of @xmath0 , and points to the necessity of including larger spectator masses , corresponding to processes @xmath67 and @xmath72 outlined in section ii . in the next section",
    "we describe the contributions to the structure functions from the larger spectator mass components of the quark spectral function .",
    "as clearly seen in the previous section , one should not expect valence quark distributions calculated from the handbag diagram alone to exhibit the correct behavior at small @xmath0 .",

    "phenomenologically , the main difference between these forms arises at small @xmath0 , where the @xmath359-dependent functions give somewhat smaller distributions .",
    "the reason for this is the @xmath360 factor in @xmath359 , which at small @xmath0 serves to suppress the quark distributions , which themselves depend on inverse powers of @xmath359 .",
    "having outlined how one could systematically include dis contributions from diquarks , we should point out however that dis from diquarks is in fact a next - to - leading order process in the @xmath361 coupling constant @xmath362 .",
    "hence it should be treated on the same footing as the order @xmath363 processes involving pion dressing , such as the direct scattering from the nucleon s pion cloud . while the higher - order ( higher - mass ) processes can in principle be systematically included , it is in fact more efficient to describe them in terms of the regge model described in section iv.b .",
