    "let me remind briefly the basic scheme of a photon collider  @xcite,@xcite , see fig.[gensch ] .",
    "two electron beams after the final focus system are traveling toward the interaction point ( ip ) . at a distance of about 0.11 cm upstream from the ip , at the conversion point ( c ) ,",
    "the laser beam is focused and compton backscattered by electrons , resulting in the high energy beam of photons . with reasonable laser parameters one can `` convert '' most of electrons into high energy photons .",
    "the photon beam follows the original electron direction of motion with a small angular spread of order @xmath2 , arriving at the ip in a tight focus , where it collides with the similar opposing high energy photon beam or with an electron beam .",
    "the photon spot size at the ip may be almost equal to that of electrons at ip and therefore , the luminosity of ,  collisions will be of the same order of magnitude as the `` geometric '' luminosity of basic @xmath3 beams .",
    "the detailed description of photon colliders properties can be found in refs  @xcite@xcite and in the berkeley workshop proceedings  @xcite .",
    "now , this option is included into the conceptual design reports of the nlc  @xcite , tesla ",
    "sblc  @xcite and jlc  @xcite .",
    "all these linear collider projects foresee the second interaction region for ,  collisions .",
    "this is quite a success but for final decisions it is necessary to have very clear justification that photon colliders are realistic and can substantially add to a discovery potential of linear colliders .",
    "below are some arguments for photon colliders . 1 .",
    "some phenomena can be studied at photon colliders better than anywhere , for example , the measurement of  @xmath4 higgs width , which is sensitive to all heavy charged particles ; study of the vertex @xmath5ww .    2 .",
    "cross sections for the pair production of charged scalar , leptons and top in  collisions are larger than those in  collisions by a factor of 5 ; for ww production this factor is even larger : 1020 .",
    "3 .  in  collisions charged supersymmetric particles with masses higher than in  collisions can be produced ( heavy charged particle plus light neutral ) .",
    "the luminosity of photon colliders ( in the high energy part of luminosity spectrum ) with electron beam parameters considered in the present designs will be about @xmath6 or by a factor 5 smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "but the absence of collisions effects at 0.1  1 tev photon colliders allows to reach  up to @xmath8  using electron beams with very low emittances .",
    "high luminosity photon colliders can provide two orders high production rate of ww pair and other charged particles ( see item 2 ) .",
    "obtaining of the ultimately high luminosities requires the development of new techniques , such as the laser cooling of electron beams  @xcite",
    ". however , linear colliders will appear ( may be ) only in one decade and will work next two decades .",
    "the upgrading of the luminosity requires the injection part modification only ; it may be a separate injector for a photon collider , merging of many low emittance rf - photoguns ( with or without laser cooling ) is one of possible variants .",
    "linear colliders are very expensive facilities and their potential should be used in the best way .",
    "two detectors ( one for  and the other for  and ) can give much more results than the simple doubling of statistics in  collisions with one detector .",
    "development of x - ray fel lasers based on linear colliders ( which are now under way ) will favour the work on fel required for photon colliders .",
    "the physics in ,  colliders is very rich .",
    "the total number of papers devoted to the physics at photon colliders approaches to one thousand .",
    "some examples are given in the introduction .",
    "recent review of physics at photon colliders can be found in tesla / sblc conceptual design report  @xcite and in the talk of g. jikia at this workshop .",
    "the resonance production of higgs in  collisions and measurement of its @xmath5 width is a task of primary importance .",
    "cross sections of the charged particle production in  collisions are higher than those in  collisions . at @xmath9",
    "the ratio of cross sections are the following ( @xmath10 ) : @xmath11 .    to have the same statistics in  collisions the luminosity may be smaller than that in  collisions at least by a factor of 5 .",
    "note that result in  and  collisions are complimentary even for the same final states because diagrams are different ( for example , the vertex @xmath5ww can be studied only in collisions ) .    a reasonable scaling for the required  luminosity ( in the high energy peak of the luminosity distribution ) at  collider",
    "is @xmath12 with such a luminosity one can detect @xmath13 for the time @xmath14 . somewhat larger luminosity ( @xmath15 ) is required for the search and study of the `` intermediate '' ( @xmath16 ) higgs boson .    with an electron beam considered in current projects  @xcite ,",
    "@xcite with 2e@xmath17500 gev one can obtain  @xmath18 at @xmath19 ( see next section ) .",
    "it is determined only by the `` geometric ''  luminosity .",
    "using beams with smaller emittances one can get higher luminosity .",
    "analyses of principle restrictions on luminosity of photon colliders have shown  @xcite ( see sect.4 ) that at @xmath20 one can obtain ( in principle ) @xmath21",
    "recently , two groups nlc  @xcite and tesla / sblc  @xcite ( and soon jlc ) have published conceptual design reports of their linear collider projects containing comprehensive appendixes devoted to ,  options .",
    "below is a short review of these designs .",
    "two collision scheme were considered .",
    "( `` without deflection '' ) . there is no magnetic deflection of spent electrons and all particles after the conversion region travel to the ip .",
    "the conversion point may be situated very close to the ip ; ( `` with deflection '' ) .",
    "after the conversion region , particles pass through a region with a transverse magnetic field ( @xmath22 0.51 t ) where electrons are swept aside .",
    "thereby one can achieve more or less pure  or  collisions .    in both schemes ,",
    "the removal of the disrupted spent beam is done by using the crab crossing scheme with the crossing angle about 30 mrad .",
    "the maximum disruption angle does not exceed 10 mrad and outgoing beams travel outside the final quads located at a distance about 2 m from the ip .",
    "the conversion region is situated at the distance @xmath23 0.51.5 cm from the ip .",
    "an optimum laser wave length for the collider with 2e = 500 gev is about 1 @xmath24 ( for @xmath25 ) and grows proportionally to the beam energy .",
    "the required flash energy for obtaining the conversion coefficient @xmath26 is about 14 j for an electron bunch length @xmath27 0.10.5 mm , laser peak power is about 0.50.7 tw , average power is about 20 kw .",
    "obtaining such parameters is possible with either solid state lasers or free electron lasers . for @xmath28 ( e@xmath29 250300 gev )",
    "fel is the only option seen now .",
    "the possible layout of optics near the ip is shown in fig  [ opti ] .      in current projects ,",
    "the  luminosity is determined by the `` geometric '' ee  luminosity . due to the absence of beamstrahlung , beams in  collisions",
    "can have much smaller horizontal beam size than that in  collisions , therefore the beta functions were taken as small as possible ( some restrictions are posed by the oide effect connected with chromatic aberrations due to synchrotron radiation in the final quads ) .",
    "typical  luminosity distribution is broad with its peak at maximum invariant masses at @xmath30 ( for @xmath31=4.8 ) .",
    "the region @xmath32 is the most valuable part of luminosity due to high energy and high degree of polarization .",
    "the luminosity in this part is about 10% of the geometric ee luminosity .",
    "the results of simulations for different projects are the following .",
    "for the `` nominal '' beam parameters ( the same as in  collisions ) and the optimum final focus system the luminosity @xmath33  for nlc / tesla / sblc .",
    "the peak luminosity is also an important characteristic , it is approximately equal to @xmath34 .",
    "these numbers are close for the schemes with and without magnetic deflection .    in the scheme without deflection",
    ",  collisions can be studied simultaneously with  collisions . in this case",
    "the  luminosity is even higher than  by a factor of 1.5 ( this is valid only for considered beam parameters ; for very small beam sizes @xmath35 due to beam  beam repulsion ) .",
    "the magnetic deflection allows to obtain almost clean  collisions with fwhm@xmath367% .",
    "there are several possibilities for increasing luminosity .",
    "\\1 ) reduction of the horizontal emittance by optimizing the damping rings . for example , at the tesla , the decrease in  by a factor 3.5 leads to an increase in  up to @xmath37 .",
    "\\2 ) one can use the low emittance rf - photoguns instead of damping rings .",
    "unfortunately , even with best photoguns the luminosity will be somewhat lower than that with damping rings .",
    "however , there is one possible solution .",
    "the normalized emittance in photoguns is approximately proportional to the number of particles in the electron bunch .",
    "it seems possible to merge ( using some difference in energies ) many ( @xmath38 ) low current beams with low emittances to one high current beam with the same transverse emittance .",
    "this gives the gain in luminosity more than by a factor @xmath39 in comparison with one photogun ( `` more '' because the lower emittance allows smaller beta functions due to the oide effect ) .",
    "joining beams from five photoguns with experimentally achieved parameters leads at tesla / sblc to  = ( 34)@xmath40 .    for a considerable step in luminosity",
    "the beams with much lower emittances are required that needs the development of new approaches such as a _ laser cooling _",
    "@xcite ( sect.4.2 ) .",
    "potentially this method allows to attain the geometric luminosity by two orders higher than those achievable by the methods discussed above .",
    "one example  @xcite of the luminosity distributions for the `` super '' tesla with round beams and emittances by a factor 50 lower than that achieved with rf ",
    "photoguns is shown in fig  [ dg5 ] .",
    "beam parameters and resulting luminosities are given below .",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42  mm , @xmath43  gev , @xmath44  khz , @xmath45  m  rad , @xmath46  mm , @xmath47  nm , @xmath48  @xmath49  c@xmath50    ,    @xmath51 , @xmath52  @xmath49  c@xmath50 ,    @xmath53 , @xmath54  @xmath49  c@xmath50 ,    ,    @xmath55 , @xmath56  @xmath49  c@xmath50 ,    @xmath57 , @xmath58  @xmath49  c@xmath50 ,    results are impressive : @xmath59 ( 11.5)@xmath60  ( 23 times higher than those in  collisions ) .",
    "it is not the limit ( see sect.4.3 )",
    "recently  @xcite , a new method was considered  laser cooling of electron beams  which allows , in principle , to reach @xmath61 .",
    "the idea of laser cooling of electron beams is very simple . during a collision with optical laser photons ( in the case of strong field it is more appropriate to consider the interaction of an electron with an electromagnetic wave ) the transverse distribution of electrons ( @xmath62 ) remains almost the same .",
    "also , the angular spread ( @xmath63 ) is almost constant , because for photon energies ( a few ev ) much lower than the electron beam energy ( several gev ) the scattered photons follow the initial electron trajectory with a small additional spread .",
    "so , the emittance @xmath64 remains almost unchanged . at the same time , the electron energy decreases from @xmath65 down to @xmath66 .",
    "this means that the transverse normalized emittances have decreased : @xmath67 .",
    "one can reaccelerate the electron beam up to the initial energy and repeat the procedure . then after n stages of cooling @xmath68 ( if  is far from its limit ) .",
    "some possible sets of parameters for the laser cooling are : @xmath69 gev , @xmath70 mm , @xmath71 , flash energy @xmath72 j. the final electron bunch will have an energy of 0.45  with an energy spread @xmath73 , the normalized emittances , are reduced by a factor 10 .",
    "a two stage system with the same parameters gives 100 times reduction of emittances .",
    "the limit on the final emittance is @xmath74 m  rad at @xmath75 . for comparison , in the tesla ( nlc ) project the damping rings have @xmath76 m  rad , @xmath77 m  rad .",
    "this method requires a laser system even more powerful than that for e @xmath78 conversion .",
    "however , all the requirements are reasonable taking into account fast progress of laser technique and time plans of linear colliders",
    ". a multiple use of the laser bunch can reduce considerably an average laser power .",
    "the laser and electron beams interact with each other most efficiently when laser and electron beams have the same duration and the depth of laser focus ( rayleigh length ) is somewhat shorter than the beam length .",
    "it turns out that in many cases , the density of laser photons is so high that instead of the compton scattering an electron interacts simultaneously with many photons ( synchrotron radiation ) .",
    "this is not desirable since in the regime of strong field ( @xmath79 ) the spectrum of scattered photons after conversion region is not so peaked as in the compton scattering case . in the method of laser cooling the strong field",
    "leads to higher values of minimum emittance and higher polarization loss .",
    "of course , one can take laser bunch longer to keep collision probability constant and the density of photons below the critical value .",
    "however , in this case , the laser flash energy should be larger than that under optimum conditions given in the beginning of this paragraph .",
    "due to this nonlinear qed effect the laser flash energy required for photon colliders should grow proportionally to the collider energy  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "recently  @xcite , it was found how to avoid this problem . in the suggested scheme",
    "the focus depth is stretched without changing the radius of this area . in this case",
    ", the collision probability remains the same but the maximum value of the field is smaller .",
    "the solution is based on use of chirped laser pulses and chromaticity of the focusing system  . in this scheme ,",
    "the laser target consists of many laser focal points ( continuously ) and light comes to each point exactly at the moment when the electron bunch is there .",
    "one can consider that a short electron bunch collides on its way sequentially with many short light pulses of length @xmath80 and focused with @xmath81 .",
    "the required flash energy in the scheme with a stretched laser focus is determined only by diffraction and at the optimum wave length ( @xmath31=4.8 ) does not depend on the collider energy .",
    "the stretching of laser focus enables a substantial decrease in flash energy in the method of laser cooling , to achieve minimum emittances and to conserve polarization of electron beams .",
    "the only collision effect restricting  luminosity at photon colliders is the coherent pair creation which leads to the conversion of a high energy photon into  pair in the field of opposing electron beam  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "there are three ways to avoid this effect : a ) to use flat beams ; b ) to deflect the electron beam after conversion at a sufficiently large distance from the ip ; c ) under certain conditions ( low beam energy , long bunches ) the beam field at the ip is below the critical one due to the repulsion of electron beams @xcite .",
    "the problem of ultimate luminosities for different beam parameters and energies was analyzed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite analytically and by simulation .",
    "resume is the following .",
    "the maximum luminosity is attained when the conversion point is situated as close as possible to the ip : @xmath82 $ ] cm ( here the second term is equal to the minimum length of the conversion region ) . in this case , the vertical radius of the photon beam at the ip is also minimum : @xmath83 ( assuming that the vertical size of the electron beam is even smaller ) .",
    "an optimum horizontal beam size ( @xmath84 ) depends on the beam energy , number of particles in a bunch and bunch length .",
    "the dependence of the  luminosity on @xmath84 for various energies and number of particles in a bunch is shown in fig.[sb3 ] .",
    "the bunch length is fixed to be equal to 0.2 mm .",
    "the collision rate is calculated from the total beam power which is equal to 15e[tev ] mw ( close to that in current projects ) . in the fig.4",
    "we see that at low energies and small number of particles the luminosity curves follows their natural behaviour @xmath85 while at high energy and large number of particles in a bunch the curves make zigzag which is explained by @xmath86  conversion in the field of the opposing beam .    what is remarkable in these results ?",
    "first of all , the maximum attainable luminosities are huge . at low energies",
    "there are no coherent pair creation even for a very small @xmath84 when the field in the beam is much higher than the critical field @xmath87 .",
    "this is explained by the fact that beams during the collision are repulsing each other so that the field on the beam axis ( which affects on high energy photons ) is below the critical field .",
    "it means that the @xmath5 luminosity is simply proportional to the geometric electron - electron luminosity ( approximately @xmath88 ) for @xmath89 nm . for the energies 2e@xmath90 2 tev which are in reach of next generation of linear colliders the luminosity limit is much higher than it is required by our scaling low given by eq.1 .",
    "one of important problems at high luminosities is a background due to relatively large total cross section @xmath91@xmath92    the average number of hadron events / per bunch crossing is about one at @xmath93 at the typical collision rate 10 khz .",
    "however , in the scheme without deflection the total luminosity is larger than the `` useful '' @xmath94 by a factor 510 .",
    "this low energy collisions increase background by a factor 23  @xcite .",
    "let us assume the photon collider luminosity to be @xmath95  ( top of our dreams ) , this leads to about 15 ( effectively ) high energy @xmath96 events per bunch crossing .",
    "approximately the same number ( @xmath3630 ) of events / collision is expected in detectors at the lhc .",
    "however , there is an important difference between pp and  colliders : in the case of an interesting event ( high @xmath97 jets or leptons ) the total energy of final products at photon colliders is equal to @xmath98 , while at proton colliders it is only about ( 1/6)@xmath98 . in comparison with the pp collider the ratio of the signal to background at photon colliders is better by a factor of 6 at the same number of hadronic events per crossing .",
    "note , however , that at nlc and jlc the time between collisions is only about 1.5 ns and background from a few neighbouring events will overlap . at more realistic top luminosities about @xmath99  even with this fact the background conditions will be acceptable .",
    "these arguments and detailed simulation  @xcite show that the problem of hadronic background is not dramatic for photon colliders .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of `` photon 97 '' for the nice workshop which was one of important steps towards photon colliders .",
