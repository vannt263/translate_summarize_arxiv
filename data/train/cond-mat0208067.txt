    "as classical fluids and gasses , superfluids , bose - einstein condensates , and also superconductors support vortices @xcite : extended line - like objects around which the fluid or gas executes a circular motion . in the classical world , vortices are better known as whirlpools ( in fluids ) and as whirlwinds ( in the atmosphere)or also as tornadoes , or typhoons , depending on which side of the pacific ocean one lives .",
    "the velocity of the circular motion around a vortex line varies as the inverse of the distance to the rotation axis .",
    "the strong winds close to the center of a whirlwind  the so - called eye of a tornado  are , incidentally , responsible for most of the damages caused by typhoons .",
    "a striking difference with classical systems is that the circulation around these extended line objects in quantum systems is quantized . given that a vortex usually is macroscopic in size and sets all the atoms or electrons of the system in motion , the quantization of circulation is truly remarkable and can not in general be related to the quantization rules of quantum mechanics .",
    "instead , as is well known , the quantization here is provided by topology @xcite .",
    "the presence of vortices in superfluids and bose - einstein condensates is an emergent property , associated with the spontaneous breaking of global gauge symmetry @xcite . in supercondutors , this symmetry becomes a local one , which strictly speaking can not be spontaneously broken , but the following argument is not affected by it .",
    "the vacuum manifold , defining the system s minimum of energy , is a circle s@xmath0 parametrized by the phase of the spontaneously broken u(1 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "if a vortex is circled once , the phase moves around the circle s@xmath0 representing the vacuum manifold .",
    "a vortex therefore provides a map from the circle s@xmath1 in real space to s@xmath0 .",
    "such maps are characterized by an _ integer _ winding number telling how often the map wraps around the circle s@xmath0 when s@xmath1 in real space is circled once .",
    "the integer nature of the winding number explains the quantization of circulation around vortices in quantum systems",
    ". a vortex of a given winding number can not be continuously deformed into one of a different winding number and hence is topologically stable .",
    ", width=340 ]    in these lecture notes , superfluid phase transitions are discussed from the perspective of quantized vortices in the spirit of onsager s picture of the @xmath2 transition in liquid @xmath3he @xcite .",
    "the description envisaged by onsager is one entirely in terms of these one - dimensional objects , with their geometrical properties such as fractal dimension and configurational entropy . in the absence of an applied rotation ( for superfluids ) or magnetic field ( for superconductors )",
    ", vortices can not terminate inside the system and must form closed loops .",
    "a superfluid phase transition is characterized in this picture by a fundamental change in the typical loop size .",
    "whereas in the superfluid phase only finite loops are present , at the critical point infinite loops appear  similar to the sudden appearance of a percolating cluster in percolation phenomena at critically @xcite . in feynman",

    "we are describing the disorder of helium  i. ''    the similarity between vortex loop proliferation and cluster percolation is , as will be discussed , very close .",
    "it derives from a similarity in the cluster size and loop size distribution .",
    "both have the same form containing two factors , one related to the entropy of a given cluster or loop configuration , and the other related to the boltzmann weight assigned to the configuration .",
    "close to criticality , both of these factors are parametrized by a single exponent .",
    "one specifies the algebraic behavior of the distribution at criticality , while the other describes how the boltzmann factor tends to unity upon approaching the critical point .",
    "clusters and loops that are otherwise exponentially suppressed can grow without bound when the boltzmann factor becomes unity and , thus , gain configurational entropy without energy cost .",
    "the picture of the @xmath2 transition in liquid @xmath3he in terms of proliferating vortices , which disorder the system and thereby restore the spontaneously broken u(1 ) symmetry , has been advanced since then by various authors @xcite .",
    "early numerical evidence for this picture based on monte carlo simulations of the three - dimensional xy - model was given in refs .  .",
    "analytic methods to describe the transition using vortex loops were further developed by williams @xcite , and by shenoy and collaborators @xcite .",
    "more recent numerical work on the three - dimensional xy - model from the perspective of vortices , in particular their loop size distribution , can be found in refs .  .    the famous drawing ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : duck_rabbit ] ) introduced by the psychologist j.  jastrow serves as a metaphor for the approach followed in these notes .",

    "in this section , the paradigm of geometrical phase transitions , viz.percolation , and its extension to describe thermal phase transitions are discussed .      to define ( site ) percolation , consider a lattice with @xmath4 sites labeled by the index @xmath5 .",

    "a given site is occupied whether or not neighboring ( or any other ) sites are , this process is more precisely referred to as _ uncorrelated _ percolation .",
    "as the occupation probability @xmath7 increases , more sites become occupied and the clusters grow . for high - enough values of @xmath7 , a large cluster , spanning the lattice is frequently generated during updates ( see the right panel of fig .",

    "the appearance of such a percolating cluster is a fundamental property and not an artifact of working on a finite lattice",
    ". even on an infinite lattice , a percolating cluster , which would then be of infinite size , appears .",
    "the only difference between a finite and infinite lattice is that the percolating cluster on an infinite lattice first appears at a specific value @xmath9 , special to the dimensionality and symmetry of the lattice considered , whereas on a finite lattice there is always a finite probability to generate a percolating cluster when @xmath10 . also , for @xmath11 , the percolating cluster is always generated on an infinite lattice , but not necessarily so on a finite one .",
    "the theory of finite - size scaling is needed to extract the value of @xmath12 from numerical simulations done on finite lattices @xcite .",
    "percolation theory @xcite can be set up starting from the cluster size distribution @xmath13 , giving the number density of clusters of size @xmath14 .",
    "close to the percolation threshold , it takes the form @xmath15 where the coefficient @xmath16 vanishes with an exponent @xmath17 when the percolation threshold @xmath12 is approached from below . the cluster size distribution ( [ perdis ] )",
    "contains two factors . the first one measures ( as will become clear below when discussing random walks ) the configurational entropy of clusters , while the exponential is similar to a boltzmann factor which for finite @xmath16 suppresses large clusters .",
    "the latter vanishes when the percolation threshold is approached from below , implying no longer a restriction on forming arbitrary large clusters and resulting in a proliferation of clusters .",
    "although percolation lacks a conventional description in terms of an hamiltonian , a partition function @xmath18 can nevertheless be defined through @xmath19 with @xmath20 denoting the volume of the system .",
    "the right hand counts the number of clusters of all sizes . as in statistical physics , various physically relevant quantities",
    "can be calculated from @xmath18 , such as the percolation strength @xmath21 , which for @xmath22 denotes the probability that a randomly chosen site belongs to the percolating cluster , and the average cluster size @xmath23 .",

    "a final critical exponent , @xmath31 , specifies the power - law behavior of the correlation function @xmath32 at the percolation threshold .",
    "physically , @xmath33 denotes the probability that the sites with position vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 belong to the same cluster .",
    "it usually is only a function of the distance between the two sites and has at @xmath36 the algebraic behavior in @xmath37 space dimensions @xmath38 the exponent @xmath39 , together with the so - called fisher exponent @xcite @xmath40 , specifying the cluster size distribution ( [ perdis ] ) , determine these critical exponents through scaling relations [ see eq .",
    "( [ pec ] ) below ] .    since the percolating cluster , often also referred to as _ infinite _ cluster , includes a macroscopic fraction of the total number of sites , its mere size would dominate any sum .",
    "for this reason , summations @xmath41 over cluster sizes exclude the percolating , or infinite one . in practice @xcite ,",

    "the percolation strength @xmath25 can nevertheless be extracted from considering only finite clusters in eq.([zlg ] ) because of the constraint @xmath42 stating that an occupied site either belongs to the infinite cluster or to a finite one .",
    "this constraint is special to percolation .",
    "another important quantity characterizing percolation is the radius of gyration @xmath43 , @xmath44 which gives a measure of the spatial extent of a cluster of size @xmath14 centered at @xmath45 . for large enough clusters",

    "[ fig : cut_ball],width=226 ]    the discussion so far concentrated on clusters of occupied sites , which for @xmath10 make up the minority phase , while the unoccupied sites form the majority phase . at the percolation threshold",
    "this changes and the roles of the minority and majority phases are interchanged .",
    "in other words , when approaching the percolation threshold from above , one would naturally concentrate on the disfavored unoccupied , rather than on the abundant occupied sites . from that side , the transition corresponds to a proliferation of clusters of unoccupied sites . in a sense ,",
    "the two descriptions are dual to each other with the minority and majority phases interchanged .      to see how percolation theory can be applied to thermal phase transitions taking place in spin models consider the ising model at the absolute zero of temperature @xcite .",
    "here , in the absence of fluctuations , all the spins , which in principle can take the values @xmath60 , point in one direction .",
    "when the temperature @xmath61 increases , some of the spins will reverse their direction .",
    "the resulting spin configuration at a given temperature is easily mapped onto a percolation problem by identifying the sites with reversed spins with occupied sites .",
    "the question is now if the critical behavior of the ising model can be recovered , focusing exclusively on these clusters instead of the magnetic properties . in other words",
    ", are the correct values for the critical temperature and the critical exponents obtained when measuring quantities like the percolation strength and the average cluster size discussed above",
    "?    it turns out that , in general , clusters of sites with reversed spins proliferate already before the thermal phase transition is reached .",
    "( only on a two - dimensional square lattice , the temperature where a percolating cluster first appears coincides with the critical temperature . ) moreover , the critical exponents thus obtained are those of uncorrelated percolation and not of the ising model ( even on a two - dimensional square lattice ) .",
    "this means that the clusters constructed in this naive way lack essential information about the ising model and need to be modified .    to construct a modified cluster @xcite ,",
    "take two nearest - neighboring sites @xmath62 of a naive cluster with its spins reversed , and include the pair into the modified cluster only with the bond probability @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the spin - spin coupling of the ising model and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 boltzmann s constant .",
    "the factor @xmath67 appearing here corresponds to the increase in energy when one of the two spins involved in the bond is flipped .",
    "the upshot of this modification is that the resulting bond clusters are in general smaller than the naive ones and also more loosely connected .",
    "the modified clusters turn out to proliferate right at the critical temperature and display critical behavior identical to that of the ising model  as should be according to an exact map of the partition function of the ising model onto correlated percolation by fortuin and kasteleyn @xcite .",
    "the above scenario was recently extended to three - dimensional o(@xmath68 ) spin models , with @xmath69 .",
    "instead of taking only the two values @xmath70 , which can be thought of as comprising a zero - dimensional sphere , the spins of the o(@xmath68 ) model can take any value on the ( @xmath68@xmath711)-dimensional sphere defined by @xmath72",
    ". the o(@xmath68 ) model with @xmath73 corresponds to the xy - model , while that with @xmath74 corresponds to the heisenberg model .",
    "an exact analytic map onto correlated percolation as existed for the ising model is not available for @xmath75 , so that numerical simulations are needed to establish the existence of such a map @xcite .",

    "when the spins take values in the same halve , the pair is included in a cluster with the bond probability determined by the projection @xmath84 of their spin onto the random vector .",
    "the clusters thus constructed turn out to proliferate at the critical temperature where the thermal phase transition takes place . moreover , the critical exponents obtained by measuring the percolation strength and average size of these clusters are the same as those obtained in the more traditional manner by focusing on the magnetic properties of these spin models @xcite .",
    "these examples illustrate that thermal phase transitions taking place in a wide range of statistical physics models can be reformulated in terms of percolation theory .",
