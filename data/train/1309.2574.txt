    "distributed consensus algorithms have been serving as basic models of information dissemination and aggregation over complex networks throughout a wide area of sciences including social sciences , engineering , and biology , e.g. , opinion dynamics over social networks @xcite , parallel computation and data fusion for sensor networks @xcite , formation control in robotic networks @xcite , and flocking of animal groups @xcite .    in a typical consensus algorithm",
    ", a node collects information from a subset of nodes in the network called neighbors and updates its state following an  attractive \" rule , a convex combination of its own and the neighbors previous states .",
    "the neighbor relations and communication are often random , which lead to random consensus algorithms . the convergence of random consensus algorithms have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite@xcite .",
    "a great advantage for distributed consensus seeking lies in the fact that it is robust with respect to link failures and communication noise @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to the attractive update , different probabilistic convergence concepts often coincide for random consensus algorithms @xcite .",
    "few works have discussed the influence of  repulsive \" links in the network on the consensus formation despite the many motivations for doing so . in social networks ,",
    "signed graphs were introduced for formulating the tensions and conflicts between individuals .",
    "links representing interpersonal connection were associated with a sign which indicates if the mutual relationship is friendship or hostility @xcite . in sensor networks ,",
    "the communication links can be taken by attackers so that data can be injected to oppose consensus @xcite . in collaborative networks ,",
    "malicious users may exist whose objective is to damage the network and increase the cost incurred by the legitimate users @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "a class of antagonistic interactions modeled as negative weights in the update law were studied in a continuous - time setting , and necessary and sufficient conditions were derived for consensus over the network in absolute value . in @xcite ,",
    "a randomized model was formulated where each node executes an attraction , repulsion or neglect update at random when meeting other nodes .    in this paper , we study a random consensus model with both attractive and repulsive links in the underlying communication network .",
    "contrary to the model in  @xcite , where attractive and repulsive updates are selected at random , the model in this paper allows the update type to be selected based on predetermined inter - node relations .",
    "we use a gossiping model to define how nodes are selected for updating @xcite . in each time slot , a random node is selected to interact with a random neighbor .",
    "the node updates its state following standard attractive weighted average or repulsive weighted average , determined by whether the link is attractive or repulsive .",
    "our main contributions are the following .",
    "* we establish various conditions for convergence or divergence in expectation , in mean square , and almost surely .",
    "in contrast to the standard consensus model without repulsive updates , some fundamental differences show up in these probabilistic modes . *",
    "we show that under mild assumptions there is a threshold value for the strength of the repulsive action for which the convergence in expectation changes : when the repulsive weight crosses this threshold , the randomized consensus algorithm transits from convergence to divergence . the explicit value of the threshold is derived for classes of attractive and repulsive graphs . *",
    "we establish a no - survivor theorem for almost sure divergence , which indicates that a single repulsive link can drastically change the behavior of the overall network .    the paper is organized as follows .",
