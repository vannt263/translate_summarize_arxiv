    "ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 is a geometrically frustrated spin - chain compound which has attracted considerable attention in recent years , owing to a series of puzzling properties @xcite .",
    "the structure of this compound consists of chains made up of coo@xmath2 trigonal prisms alternating with coo@xmath2 octahedra , which run along the @xmath4-axis of the hexagonal cell @xcite .",
    "these chains are separated by the ca ions and they form an hexagonal lattice on the @xmath5 plane ( see inset of fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the issue of the valence and spin states of the co ions on these two sites has been the subject of intense controversies .",
    "owing to a series of recent results @xcite , it is now widely accepted that ( i ) the co ions are trivalent for both sites ; ( ii ) owing to the difference in the crystalline electric field ( cef ) , the co@xmath6(@xmath7 ) ions are in the high - spin state for the prismatic sites ( @xmath8 ) whereas they are in the low - spin state ( @xmath9 ) for the octahedral sites . in other respects , it was early found that the intrachain coupling @xmath10 is ferromagnetic while the interchain coupling @xmath11 is antiferromagnetic @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 was found to exhibit strongly anisotropic magnetic properties , the spins having a preferential orientation along the @xmath4 axis @xcite .",
    "most probably , this last feature can be ascribed to the single - ion ( uniaxial ) anisotropy of the @xmath8 spins at the prismatic sites .    )",
    "recorded with a sweep rate of 0.1 t / min . at 2 k ( circles ) and 10 k ( solid line ) .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction of the field variation .",
    "the inset shows a projection of the structure along  the hexagonal @xmath4-axis ( the dark and light polyhedra represent coo@xmath2 trigonal prisms and coo@xmath2 octahedra , respectively ; the grey circles represent the ca ions ; the solid lines emphasize the triangular arrangement of the chains in the @xmath5 plane ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 possesses a combination of features ( i.e. triangular lattice with spins oriented along the chain direction and with an antiferromagnetic interchain coupling ) which yields a situation of geometrical frustration @xcite .",
    "it is clear that this frustration plays a great role in the peculiar magnetic properties of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "for instance , the long - range ordering which takes place below @xmath12 k @xcite was found to be closely related to the `` partially disordered antiferromagnetic '' state ( pda ) @xcite proposed by mekata @xcite about the abx@xmath0 compounds , another family of geometrically frustrated spin - chains @xcite . in the pda  state , two over three chains are antiferromagnetically coupled ( with long - range order along each of them ) , while the third one is left incoherent ( i.e. without long - range order along its direction and no correlation with its neighbors ) . among the peculiar magnetic properties of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",
    "one can mention ( i ) the appearance of a spin freezing at @xmath13 k @xcite , leading to a pronounced frequency dependence of the susceptibility ( @xmath14 ) @xcite ; ( ii ) for @xmath15 , the existence of magnetization steps with a roughly constant field spacing @xcite and the appearance of a saturation in the spin - relaxation time , these features having led us to suggest the possibility of a phenomenon of quantum tunneling of the magnetization ( qtm ) @xcite .",
    "it can be emphasized that the geometrical frustration in ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 is strongly related to the existence of a pronounced uniaxial anisotropy . in spite of this , we observe that no precise quantitative analysis of this magnetic anisotropy has been performed so far .",
    "it is the goal of the present study to extract quantitative information about the anisotropy of ca@xmath0co@xmath16o@xmath2 .",
    "single crystals of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 were grown according to the following method : a mixture of ca@xmath0co@xmath17o@xmath18 and k@xmath1co@xmath0 , in a weight ratio of 1/7 , was heated at 950 @xmath19c for 50 hours in an alumina crucible in air ; then , the cooling was performed in two steps , first down to 930 @xmath20c at 10 @xmath19c / h and then down to room temperature at 100 @xmath19c / h . this procedure leads to crystals having a needle - like shape ( with the @xmath4 axis along the longest dimension ) which is convenient for orientation purposes .",
    "these crystals can be quite long ( typically 4 mm ) but they are thin ( less than 0.5 mm ) .",
    "accordingly , we performed the measurements on an assembly of crystals .",
    "owing to their shape , we emphasize that the alignment between them , as well as with respect to the field direction ( i.e. @xmath4 axis either parallel or perpendicular to the field direction ) can be precisely achieved . moreover , the measurements for both orientations were carried out with the same mounting system just by rotating the set of crystals inside the sample rod in order to keep constant the residual background signal",
    ".    curves of magnetization as a function of @xmath3 were recorded in 0.1 t , for both orientations , by using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer ( mpms , quantum design ) .",
    "we checked that , with 0.1 t ,  we are in the linear regime of the @xmath21 curves for both orientations and over the whole investigated temperature range , @xmath22 k ( i.e. @xmath23 ) . in",
    "what follows , one considers the susceptibility curves obtained by dividing the magnetization by the measuring field , leading to @xmath24 ( i.e. with @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 ( i.e. with @xmath27 ) .",
    "two observations support the reliability of these data : first , we found that the @xmath24 is in perfect agreement with that previously obtained using bigger crystals ( of different shape ) ; second , the powder - like data obtained by calculating @xmath28 @xmath29 is found to be superimposed on the susceptibility curve registered on a ceramic ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "co@xmath1o@xmath2 , with the magnetic field applied either along the @xmath4-axis ( @xmath30 referred to as @xmath31 in the text ) or perpendicular to the c - axis ( @xmath32 referred to as @xmath33 in the text)@xmath34 also shown is the corresponding `` powder '' data derived from the general expression @xmath35(@xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "the small filled triangles represent the data directly recorded on a ceramic sample .",
    "the small filled stars represent the data previously recorded on another set of crystals ( different morphology with a larger size ) with @xmath25 . ,",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the @xmath24  and @xmath38 data as well as the derived @xmath39 curve along with data recorded on a ceramic sample and on bigger crystals with @xmath25 .",
    "these data well exhibit the considerable magnetic anisotropy of this compound . to be more quantitative ,",
    "however , one needs a proper modelization of the susceptibilities .",
    "it turns out that it is far from being obvious in the case of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 which gathers several particularities .",
    "as previously discussed , we can assume that the anisotropy of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath40 is basically a single - ion feature , originating from a combination of the cef and spin - orbit effects .",
    "we can also simply consider a heisenberg form for the intrachain coupling , while the interchain coupling ( much weaker ) can be neglected in a first approximation .",
    "in other respects , we note that a spin chain compound would require in principle a specific treatment of the magnetic coupling in order to account for the enhanced fluctuation effects in 1d systems .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is no model in the literature which takes into account all the features of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 . in what follows",
    ", we will consider two modelizations which can be applicable to some extent to the case of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "we emphasize that each of these models only accounts for a part of the features of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "it also deserves to be noted that they correspond to different approaches that can be complementary in the analysis of magnetism .",
    "we found in the literature a model which made a precise treatment of the on - site magnetism in a situation very close to ours .",
    "this work carried out by parkin and friend @xcite dealt with iron intercalates of dichalcogenides , with fe@xmath41 ( i.e. , 3d@xmath42 like co@xmath6 ) in a trigonally distorted anionic environment .",
    "it turns out that the cubic part of the cef splits the @xmath43  ground state , and generates a @xmath44 triplet at lower energy , which can be represented by a fictitious orbital angular momentum @xmath45 . on this basis ,",
    "parkin and friend @xcite performed a rigorous analysis by considering the following single - site hamiltonian :    @xmath46    the first term corresponds to the effect of the non - cubic part of the cef , the second term is the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , and the last term is the basic form of the zeeman energy . for our compound with such an hamiltonian",
    ", @xmath47 is positive while @xmath48 is negative .",
    "there is no magnetic coupling in this model but we note that a spin - spin interaction can be added if necessary by using a mean - field ( mf ) approximation ( even though we know such a mf treatment is poorly suited to 1d  systems ) .    using the eigenfunctions and associated energies , parkin and friend calculated the susceptibilities using the van vleck formula . extending their approach , we took into account all the levels of the lower triplet ( whereas only the two lowest are considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but it actually makes almost no difference .",
    "the expressions found for the susceptibilities can be written as :    @xmath49\\ ] ]    @xmath50\\ ] ]    where    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53\\ ; ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "all others parameters have their usual meaning .",
    "it can be emphasized that the exact value of @xmath47 has only a tiny influence on the final results ( we used @xmath56 k hereafter ) .",
    "roughly speaking , one can consider that the main role of the non cubic part of the cef is to split the @xmath44 triplet , which allows the so to generate anisotropy .",
    "in other respects , it must be realized that @xmath48 can not really be regarded as a free parameter in these expressions , since the spin orbit parameter is supposed to be an intrinsic characteristic of each ion , not expected to vary significantly with the environment . in the case of co@xmath57",
    ", @xmath48 must be close to -145 @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , it deserves to be noted that there is almost no adjustable parameter in this model , apart from a possible correction related to @xmath10 .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the raw data , along with the curves calculated for two values of @xmath48 . with the expected value @xmath59 @xmath58",
    ", the calculated curves do not lie far from the experimental ones , they have the right shape in the high-@xmath3 range , but there is a sizeable shift from the data .",
    "moreover , the model can not account for the existence of a minimum in @xmath60 , as it is visible in the data around 120 k. we also observed that adding a correction related to the intrachain coupling can yield a very nice fitting for @xmath24  but not for @xmath38 .",
    "strikingly , it can be noticed that remarkable fittings of both curves can be obtained with @xmath61 @xmath58 .",
    "as previously discussed , however , such a significant departure from the free ion value of @xmath62 is suspect . in conclusion",
    ", one must state that this model can not well describe the magnetic anisotropy of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 , even though it well illustrates the leading role of the spin orbit coupling .    and",
    "@xmath26 curves , together with the calculations using the model of parkin and friend with @xmath59 @xmath58 ( solid lines ) and @xmath61 @xmath58 ( dashed lines)@xmath34 , scaledwidth=70.0% ]      let us now consider a very different approach , approximating the susceptibility in the form of series expansion .",
    "this general method discards the specificities of the system under investigation ( in contrast to the previous model ) , but it was found to be powerful in many cases , even though it is by definition limited to the high-@xmath3 part of the data ( i.e. applicable only for @xmath63 larger than all the energy terms relevant to the system ) .",
    "yosida @xcite has derived such a series expansion which appears to be suitable to the case of ca@xmath0co@xmath1o@xmath2 , in the sense that it accounts for both a magnetic coupling j and an anisotropy parameter d. the starting point is an hamiltonian of the form :    @xmath64    where the index @xmath65 refers to the first neighboring spins . in such a picture ,",
    "the zeeman term involves a land factor ( which can be an adjustable parameter ) , while the uniaxial anisotropy appears as an effective term applied to the spin .",
    "even though it can carry some ambiguities , this form of hamiltonian is the most common to deal with uniaxial anisotropy , and it is very useful in practice .",
    "we underline that the @xmath47 parameter of the previous model strongly differs from @xmath66 in the above equation ( this latter parameter incorporating both the cef  and so effects ) .",

    "( 8 - 9 ) , they are three free parameters which should be adjusted to best fit to both the @xmath24  and @xmath78 data .",
    "actually , one can also use combinations of @xmath79  and @xmath26 allowing to isolate the influence of some of these parameters . for instance",
    ", it can be noted that the parameter @xmath66 disappears in the powder formula , yielding the usual form    @xmath80    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , such a behavior is found to be well obeyed by the data .",
    "fitting to the data in the range @xmath81 k leads to @xmath82 and @xmath83 k.     curve derived from the data ( see text ) , which exhibits a linear behavior at high temperature ( solid line ) .",
    "the inset shows the temperature dependence of the susceptibility ratio ( @xmath84 , together with the expectations of the yosida s model for several values of @xmath66 : from bottom to top , @xmath85 k ( dotted line ) , @xmath86 k ( solid line ) and @xmath87 k ( dashed line).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    furthermore , the ratio(@xmath84 is expected to only depend on @xmath66    @xmath88    inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows that there is a restricted range of @xmath66 values around",
    "@xmath89 k which leads to a reasonable fitting in the high-@xmath3 range .",
    "the @xmath24  and @xmath26 curves , corresponding to @xmath90 @xmath86 k and @xmath91 k , are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "the agreement with the data is far from being perfect , but it is reasonable if one considers that the same set of parameters must fit to two curves ( not to mention that perfect fittings are obtained if one authorizes different sets of parameters for each curve ) .",
    "probably , a part of the deviation from the data can be attributed to the fact that the temperatures of the fitting range are not much larger that @xmath66 . moreover",
    ", this model provides a rough description of the magnetic coupling since the 1d character is only taken into account through the value of @xmath73 (= 2 ) .    and",

    "two models of the literature have been used to analyze these data .",
