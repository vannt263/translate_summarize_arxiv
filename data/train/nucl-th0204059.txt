    "a recent finding of the double-@xmath0 hypernucleus @xmath1@xmath17he , which is called as nagara event in the kek - e373 experiment  @xcite , has a great impact not only on the study of baryon - baryon interactions in the strangeness @xmath22 sector but also on the study of dynamics of many - body systems with multi - strangeness .",
    "the importance of this event is attributed to the well - defined explanation of the process and the high quality experimental value of the @xmath14 binding energy @xmath23 mev  @xcite , which leads to a smaller @xmath14 binding , @xmath24 mev , than the previous understanding .",
    "sometimes the emulsion events include ambiguities related with serious difficulty of identifying emission of neutral particles such as neutrons and @xmath25-rays . in the nagara event , however , the production of @xmath1@xmath17he has been uniquely identified free from such an ambiguity on the basis of the observation of sequential weak decays .",
    "historically , in the 1960 s , there appeared two reports on the observation of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei , @xmath1@xmath5be  @xcite and @xmath1@xmath17he  @xcite , but the reality of the latter case was considered doubtful  @xcite .",
    "two decades later the modern emulsion - counter hybrid technique has been applied in the kek - e176 experiment  @xcite , in which a new double-@xmath0 hypernucleus event was found but no unique identification was given so far : one explanation as @xmath1@xmath5be leads to a repulsive @xmath14 interaction ( @xmath26 ) , while the other possibility involving @xmath1@xmath27b leads to an attractive @xmath14 interaction  @xcite . if the latter is the case , the extracted strength of the @xmath14 interaction is attractive with @xmath28 mev .",
    "although the latter option seems consistent with the old data of @xmath1@xmath5be  @xcite , the substantially attractive @xmath14 interaction has not been convincing .    in the strangeness nuclear physics ,",
    "the most fundamental problem is to recognize various facets of interactions among octet baryons ( @xmath29 , @xmath0 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) in a unified way .",
    "our detailed knowledge for the @xmath32 @xmath33 sector is based on the rich data of @xmath33 scatterings as well as nuclear phenomena .",
    "recent studies for @xmath34 many - body systems such as @xmath0 hypernuclei have clarified interesting features of @xmath35 and @xmath36 interactions in spite of scarce data of the free - space scatterings . on the other hand , for baryon - baryon interactions with @xmath22 sectors ,",
    "concerned presently , experimental information has been highly limited due to the extreme difficulties of two - body scattering experiments .",
    "therefore the observed @xmath14 bond energies of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei should be the most reliable source for the @xmath22 interaction , and such data play a decisive role in determining the strength of underlying @xmath14 interactions .",
    "in view of this relevance and the experimental situation , the nagara event is an epoch - making one which provides us with a new and firm basis for understanding the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei . in recent years",
    "several experiments to produce @xmath22 systems ( e176 and e373 at kek , e885 and e906 at bnl ) have been performed and some of the data analyses are still in progress to get novel information on the @xmath22 interactions .    in this exciting situation of the experimental study",
    ", it is needed to perform careful theoretical calculations of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei with refreshed viewpoints .",
    "as one of the motivations of the present work , we think it necessary and timely to put the nagara data of @xmath1@xmath17he binding energy as a new standard basis for a systematic study of a series of several double-@xmath0 species . secondly , in order to extract information on the @xmath14 interactions precisely , here we emphasize that hypernuclear calculations should be complete and realistic enough to leave structural ambiguity as negligibly as possible .",
    "all the dynamical changes due to successive @xmath0 participation should be also taken faithfully . to meet these requirement",
    "we explore light @xmath37-shell double-@xmath0 hypernuclei ( @xmath38 comprehensively using the microscopic three- and four - body models .",
    "thirdly , by these systematic and realistic calculations , we will give reliable prediction of not only the ground - state binding energies but also possible excited - state energies , which encourages double-@xmath0 hypernuclear spectroscopic study in near future .",
    "so far several cluster models have appeared to estimate the ground - state binding energies of double-@xmath0 species : based on the old data of @xmath1@xmath17he and @xmath1@xmath5be , takaki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite applied a simplified version of the @xmath39 cluster model to @xmath40 systems in which they put several angular momentum restriction and neglected rearrangement channels .",

    "this feature is important to discuss the energy levels of the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei and to extract the @xmath14 interactions because the ambiguities of @xmath33 and @xmath35 effective interactions are renormalized by fitting the known binding energies of subsystems phenomenologically .",

    "now it should be stressed that the above experimental data of @xmath1@xmath5be@xmath202 leads to no information for the ground - state value of @xmath16 unless the theoretical value ( 2.86 mev in our case ) of the excitation energy of @xmath1@xmath5be@xmath202 is utilized .    on the other hand , the old experiment by danysz _",
    "@xcite on the pionic decay of @xmath203 @xmath204 @xmath205 gave @xmath206 mev .",
    "this value has been used for a long time , which means the strongly attractive @xmath14 interaction .",
    "however , it should be noted that the authors also suggested the possibility of another decay @xmath207 @xmath208 ( table 5 of ref.@xcite ) ; the same was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , too . in this case , the value of @xmath209 ( @xmath1@xmath5be @xmath210 ) is modified to 14.6 @xmath163 0.4 mev , which is obtained by using the excitation energy of @xmath211 to be 3.05 mev @xcite . this modified value turns out to be not contradictory with our calculated value , 15.14 mev .",
    "a similar re - interpretation , with the hypernuclear excited states taken into account , may be needed also for the e176 event which was identified as @xmath1@xmath27b ( @xmath1@xmath5be ) with the strongly attractive ( repulsive ) @xmath212 interaction .",
    "thus , we have understood the consistency between the experimental data and our theoretical results of @xmath1@xmath5be .",
    "we , therefore , discuss on the level structures of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei in more detail . as seen in figs . @xmath191 and table v ,",
    "the @xmath0 particle plays a glue - like role so that a whole system becomes of stronger binding .",
    "this effect in a double-@xmath0 nucleus is more enhanced than that in the corresponding single-@xmath0 nucleus .",
    "one can see a typical example in the case of @xmath1@xmath2li in fig .",
    "3 . for the unbound nuclear system of @xmath109li , a single @xmath0 can not make a bound system of @xmath83li , but",
    ", the addition of one more @xmath0 particle leads to a bound system of @xmath1@xmath2li whose ground state is of weakly - binding with respect to the @xmath1@xmath17he@xmath213 threshold .",
    "the bound excited states of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei predicted in the present cluster model are summarized as follows : in @xmath1@xmath2he and @xmath1@xmath2li , the ground states are both bound but no excited states are predicted .",
    "it is needless to say , there are no bound excited states in double-@xmath0 hypernuclei with @xmath214 since there is no bound excited state in their core nuclei .",
    "the lightest double-@xmath0 hypernucleus that has at least one excited state is @xmath1@xmath3li . in @xmath1@xmath3li",
    "we predict two @xmath215 excited states in the bound - state region .",
    "it is expected to have a @xmath216 bound excited state in @xmath1@xmath3li which corresponds to the @xmath216 state in @xmath122li nucleus at @xmath217 mev , but the state is not shown in fig .",
    "4 because the @xmath218 state may have five - body structure and is out of scope of the present cluster model .",
    "we predict three bound excited states in @xmath1@xmath4li ( @xmath1@xmath4be ) .",
    "there is one bound excited state in @xmath1@xmath5be as mentioned before .",
    "it will be challenging to discover these excited states one by one as well as the ground states .",
    "it is interesting to look at the dynamical change of the @xmath21 nuclear cores which occurs due to the successive participation of two @xmath0 particles .",
    "the possibility that a nuclear core shrinks due to an attached @xmath0 particle has been theoretically pointed out using the @xmath49 cluster model of light @xmath37-shell @xmath0 hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "an updated prediction @xcite was made specifically on a shrinkage in size by 21% to be seen in @xmath84li .",
    "the recent measurement of @xmath25-ray transition rate in @xmath84li  @xcite has confirmed quantitatively the shrinkage effect predicted in both the old calculation and the updated one .",
    "it is quite reasonable , therefore , that in a double-@xmath0 hypernucleus the participation of one more @xmath0 particle can induce further shrinkage of the nuclear core .",
    "such an effect has been also investigated systematically using the molecular orbital model for @xmath219be @xmath220 @xcite . in order to see such shrinkage effect ,",
    "we show three physical quantities : first in table vi we list the r.m.s .",
    "distance between @xmath8 and @xmath63 , @xmath221 . as the number of the @xmath0 particles increases , @xmath221 turns out to shrink significantly due to the glue - like role of the attached @xmath0 particles .",
    "for example , one sees @xmath222 changes as @xmath223  fm for @xmath224li@xmath225 @xmath1@xmath3li .",
    "participation of the second @xmath0 gives rise to about 8 % reduction of @xmath222 except @xmath226 .",
    "secondly , in more detail , it is worthwhile to demonstrate in fig .",
    "8 the change of the @xmath227 two - body density ( correlation function ) @xmath228 ) in the @xmath109he , @xmath83he and @xmath1@xmath2he when @xmath0 particles participate successively , which again manifests the shrinkage effect .",
    "thirdly , this shrinkage effect is seen in the large change of the expectation value of the relative kinetic energy , @xmath229 , and that of the potential energy , @xmath230 , in the @xmath231 subsystems .",
    "when the @xmath8 and @xmath63 clusters approach to each other , the increase of @xmath229 overcomes the gain of @xmath230 , and the sum @xmath232 increases appreciably . in spite of this energy loss in the @xmath95 core system ,",
    "the core shrinkage is realized by the stronger energy gain of the @xmath233 and @xmath234 parts .      in fig .",
    "9 we reveal the contributions of the @xmath14 interaction to the total binding energies of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei @xmath235z . here",
    "the calculated values of @xmath236z ) in the ground states are shown by closed circles .",
    "in order to extract the contribution of the @xmath14 interaction , we perform the same calculations by putting @xmath237 .",
    "the obtained values are denoted as @xmath236z ; @xmath237 ) and shown by open circles in the figure .",
    "it should be noted that the effect of the dynamical change of the @xmath9 core due to the @xmath35 interactions is included in the four - body estimate of @xmath16 and @xmath16(@xmath237 ) . since the @xmath14 interaction is not so strong compared with the @xmath35 interaction , the core - rearrangement effects included in @xmath16 and @xmath16(@xmath237 )",
    "are similar to each other .",
    "then , naturally the pure effect of the @xmath14 interaction is given by the difference @xmath238 we consider @xmath239 as the @xmath14 bond energy which should be determined essentially by the strength of the @xmath14 interaction .",
    "now in fig .",
    "9 , we find that the magnitude of @xmath239 , the energy difference between the closed and open circles , is almost constant at @xmath240 1 mev for all the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei with @xmath40 .",
    "the detailed values of @xmath239 are listed in table v.    so far the following intuitive formula has been often used to estimate the @xmath14 interaction strength : @xmath241 it is worthwhile to point out the problems underlying in this formula : this expression includes three problems which come from i ) the mass - polarization term of the three - body kinetic - energy operator , ii ) the @xmath35 spin - spin interaction and iii ) the dynamical change of the core nuclear structure .",
    "the problem i ) is stated as follows : in the @xmath242 three - body model for @xmath1@xmath17he ( generally , `` @xmath8 '' may be replaced by `` spinless frozen - core nucleus '' ) , if one takes the _",
    "non_-jacobian coordinate set @xmath243 and @xmath244 , the shrdinger equation may be written , in a self - explanatory notation , as @xmath245\\psi_{jm}(^6_{\\lambda \\lambda}{\\rm he } ) = 0 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the third term of the kinetic energy , the so - called mass - polarization term , and @xmath246 are neglected , we have the trivial solution @xmath247 .",
    "therefore , the quantity @xmath248 stands for the contribution from the neglected two terms . in @xmath1@xmath17he ,",
    "the contribution to @xmath16 from the mass - polarization term is @xmath249 mev which explains the difference between @xmath250 mev and the @xmath14 bond energy @xmath251 mev in table v. this contribution decreases rapidly as the core - nuclear mass increases ( @xmath252 mev in @xmath1@xmath5be ) .",
    "next , we discuss about the second problem , an effect of the @xmath35 spin - spin interaction on @xmath253 of eq.(4.2 ) . in fig .",
    "10 , the calculated values of @xmath253 are illustrated by the dashed bars .",
    "one notices clearly that @xmath253 has peculiar mass dependence in which some interesting mechanism is included . it should be remarked here , however , that , as was already pointed out by danysz _",
    "@xcite , the traditional definition of eq.([eq : deltabll ] ) is of simple meaning only when the nuclear core is spinless . on the other hand , in the case of nuclear core with spin ,",
    "the single-@xmath0 binding energy @xmath89 to be subtracted from @xmath16 is distributed over the ground - state doublet of the corresponding single-@xmath0 hypernucleus .    here",
    ", we remark the fact that the @xmath35 spin - spin interaction is not effective ( cancelled out ) in the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei having the @xmath14 spin - singlet pairs . in the parent single-@xmath0 hypernuclei",
    ", however , the spin - spin interaction plays an important role in giving rise to the energy splitting of the ground - state doublet .",
    "the typical and unique example known experimentally is the spin - doublet in @xmath254 with @xmath255(ground ; @xmath256 mev ) and @xmath257 mev ; @xmath258 mev ) . considering this effect",
    ", one should use the spin - averaged value @xmath259li ) @xmath260 instead of @xmath261 ) when one likes to deduce @xmath253 from the @xmath1@xmath3li@xmath262 ground state data , if any .",
    "if we adopt this prescription also for the adjacent systems , we may use 0.3 cm 0.2 cm @xmath263 mev , 0.2 cm    0.2 cm @xmath264 mev , 0.2 cm    0.2 cm @xmath265 mev , 0.2 cm    0.2 cm @xmath266 mev , 0.2 cm    0.2 cm @xmath267 mev .",
    "0.3 cm    here , @xmath89 of the excited states are taken from our calculation .",
    "in general , we have @xmath268 where @xmath269 denote the doublet spins of the @xmath49 system , @xmath270 being the ground - state spin of the @xmath21 nuclear core . for the two spinless cases ( @xmath271 and @xmath8 ) , needless to say , @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "thus , replacing @xmath274 with @xmath275 in eq.(4.2 ) , we modify @xmath253 by @xmath276 as @xmath277 in fig .",
    "11 , the solid bars illustrate @xmath276 .",
    "though @xmath276 is free from the effect of the @xmath35 spin - spin interaction , its magnitude for @xmath19 deviates significantly from @xmath276 ( @xmath1@xmath17he)@xmath278 mev .",
    "the deviation comes from the effect of the dynamical change in the core nucleus structure ( shrinkage in the @xmath95 distance ) due to the partition of the @xmath0 hyperons , and turns out to be maximum in the case of @xmath1@xmath5be .",
    "we emphasize that , even if one employs @xmath276 , it is impossible to extract any consistent value of the @xmath14 bond energy from fig",
    ". 11 in which @xmath276 scatters in a range of a factor of two .    as mentioned above , a consistent estimation of the @xmath14 bond energy ( @xmath279 mev , nearly independent of the mass number , as seen in table v ) can be obtained by taking @xmath239 of eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) as the definition of that energy , though help of the theoretical calculation with @xmath237 is necessary .",
    "we have carried out structure calculations of @xmath1@xmath17he , @xmath1@xmath2he , @xmath1@xmath2li , @xmath1@xmath3li , @xmath1@xmath4li , @xmath1@xmath4be and @xmath1@xmath5be taking the framework of @xmath193 model with @xmath280he and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "we determined the interactions between constituent particles so as to reproduce reasonably the observed low - energy properties of the @xmath9 nuclei and the existing data of @xmath0-binding energies of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 systems .",
    "the @xmath14 interaction was constructed so as to reproduce the @xmath16(@xmath1@xmath17he ) given by the nagara event within our @xmath15 model , where the long - range part of our interaction was adjusted to simulate the behavior of the appropriate obe model ( nf ) . with no adjustable parameters ,",
    "the four - body calculations of the @xmath18 systems were performed accurately using the jacobian - coordinate gaussian - basis coupled - rearrangement - channel method . obtained energy spectra of the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei with @xmath40 are summarized in fig .",
    "major results to be emphasized here are as follows :    \\(1 ) it is striking that the calculated @xmath16 of the @xmath20 excited state in @xmath1@xmath5be , 12.28 mev , agrees with the experimental value @xmath281 ( @xmath1@xmath5be ) @xmath282 mev in the _ demachi - yanagi _",
    "event @xcite .",
    "we therefore interpret this event as observation of the @xmath20 excited state of @xmath1@xmath5be .",
    "the agreement suggests that our systematic calculations are predictive for coming events expected to be found in the further analysis of the e373 data , _",
    "etc_.    \\(2 ) together with the energy spectrum of each double-@xmath0 hypernucleus , those of the corresponding core nucleus and single-@xmath0 hypernucleus are exhibited side by side in figs.@xmath191 so as to see clearly that injection of one and two @xmath0 particles leads to stronger binding of the whole system and prediction of more bound states . in the bound states of any double-@xmath0 hypernucleus , two @xmath0 particles are dominantly coupled to @xmath32 and hence the spin and parity become the same as those of its nuclear core , but",
    "the theoretical @xmath16 values are of importance to guide the analysis of the emulsion experiments .",
    "\\(3 ) dynamical change of the @xmath21 nuclear core by the participation of the @xmath0 particles is substantially seen in double-@xmath0 hypernuclei ; there occurs , averagely speaking , about 8 % shrinkage of the @xmath95 distance compared with the distance in the single-@xmath0 hypernucleus .",
    "this shrinkage is realized by the large energy gain in the @xmath283 and @xmath284 parts which overcomes the energy loss in the @xmath95 relative motion .",
    "\\(4 ) we estimated the @xmath14 bond energy using the faithful definition @xmath239 @xmath285 and found it to be 0.88 mev for @xmath1@xmath17he and @xmath286 mev for the other double-@xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "we demonstrated that the quantity @xmath287 is not a good measure of the @xmath14 bond energy since @xmath253 is free from neither the contribution from the splitting of the ground - state doublet in the single-@xmath0 hypernucleus nor that of the structure change of the core nucleus .",
    "in fact , the value of @xmath253 scatters from 0.28 to 1.68 mev for the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei with @xmath40 .",
    "we then modified @xmath253 by @xmath288 with @xmath289 being the spin - average of @xmath89 s for the ground - state spin - doublet .",
    "we found , however , that @xmath276 still ranges from 0.83 to 1.68 mev due to the structure change of the core nucleus .",
    "direct use of @xmath16 itself rather than the use of @xmath253 or @xmath276 is recommended when the experimental result and calculational result are compared to each other .    in conclusion",
