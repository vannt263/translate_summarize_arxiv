    "computing a minimum distortion embedding of a given @xmath10-vertex graph @xmath8 into the line @xmath11 was recently identified as a fundamental algorithmic problem with important applications in various areas of computer science , like computer vision  @xcite , as well as in computational chemistry and biology ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it asks , for a given graph @xmath0 , to find a mapping @xmath2 of vertices @xmath12 of @xmath8 into points of @xmath11 with minimum number @xmath1 such that @xmath13 for every @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is called the _ minimum line - distortion _ of @xmath8 and denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "the embedding @xmath2 is called _ non - contractive _ since @xmath16-approximation algorithm for arbitrary unweighted input graphs , along with a polynomial - time @xmath17-approximation algorithm for unweighted trees . in another paper",
    "@xcite bdoiu et al .  showed that the problem is hard to approximate by a factor @xmath18 , even for weighted trees .",
    "they also gave a better polynomial - time approximation algorithm for general weighted graphs , along with a polynomial - time algorithm that approximates the minimum line - distortion @xmath1 embedding of a weighted tree by a factor that is polynomial in @xmath1 .",
    "fast exponential - time exact algorithms for computing the line - distortion of a graph were proposed in  @xcite .",
    "fomin et al .",
    "in  @xcite showed that a minimum distortion embedding of an unweighted graph into the line can be found in time @xmath19 .",
    "fellows et al .  in  @xcite gave an @xmath20 time algorithm that for an unweighted graph @xmath8 and integer @xmath1 either constructs an embedding of @xmath8 into the line with distortion at most @xmath1 , or concludes that no such embedding exists .",
    "they extended their approach also to weighted graphs obtaining an @xmath21 time algorithm , where @xmath22 is the largest edge weight .",
    "thus , the problem of minimum distortion embedding of a given @xmath10-vertex graph @xmath8 into the line @xmath11 is fixed parameter tractable .",
    "recently , heggernes et al",
    ".  in  @xcite initiated the study of minimum distortion embeddings into the line of specific graph classes .",
    "in particular , they gave polynomial - time algorithms for the problem on bipartite permutation graphs and on threshold graphs  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in  @xcite , heggernes et al.showed that the problem of computing a minimum distortion embedding of a given graph into the line remains np - hard even when the input graph is restricted to a bipartite , cobipartite , or split graph , implying that it is np - hard also on chordal , cocomparability , and at - free graphs .",
    "they also gave polynomial - time constant - factor approximation algorithms for split and cocomparability graphs .",
