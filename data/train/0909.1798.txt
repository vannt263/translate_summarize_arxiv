    "recently , another apparently ultraluminous transient event was presented by the supernovae cosmology project , scp06f6 ( barbary et al .",
    "the possible high brightness , slow rise to maximum ( 100 days ) , and strange spectral features of scp06f6 are still under debate .",
    "there is no detected host galaxy consistent with the position of scp06f6 although examples of low mass star - forming galaxies have been found that might be consistent with the upper limits ( dolphin et al .",
    "thus scp06f6 could define a new class if it is actually associated with a supernova explosion .",
    "due to the peculiar spectral appearance of scp06f6 and the lack of an identified host galaxy , its redshift remains uncertain .",
    "we discuss the uncertainties in the redshift , spectrum and luminosity in  2 . in the present work",
    "we examine a range of possibilities for the redshift and two special cases .",
    "we present a basic radioactive decay diffusion model plus the possible effects of a recombination front and dust formation in  3 and use it to place constraints on the distance , ejected mass , nickel mass , and kinetic energy in  4 . in  5 , we present models based on interaction of a supernova shock with circumstellar matter .",
    "a discussion is presented in  6 .",
    "barbary et al . ( 2008 ) discussed the possibility of the extragalactic origin of scp06f6 since it has a small projected distance from the center of the galaxy cluster cl 1432.5 + 3332.8 which has a redshift of 1.112 .",

    "( 2008 ) propose that the broad  absorption \" features present in the blue end of the spectrum of scp06f6 ( figure 1 ) are molecular c@xmath2 bands ( the swan bands ) originating in the cool , optically - thick atmosphere of a carbon - rich progenitor .",
    "the presence of carbon molecules constrains the temperature of the atmosphere of the progenitor to be cool so that they are not destroyed .",

    "( 2008 ) find that carbon star spectra redshifted by 0.143 provide a decent fit to the combined vlt+keck spectrum of scp06f6 ( see also soker , frankowski & kashi 2008 ) .",

    "we also investigate the case for @xmath12 where we can crudely identify three of the four broad absorption features by redshifting the spectrum of the local type ia sn  1992a or a template representing a type iip ( gililland et al .",
    "1999 ) as seen in figure 1 .",
    "a redshift of @xmath12 aligns the ca ii h&k absorption with the minimum at @xmath5 5900   in scp06f6 .",
    "the two bluest minima crudely correspond to minima in the uv spectra of sn  1992a and the sn iip template caused by overlapping lines of iron - peak elements ( harkness & wheeler 1987 ; kirshner et al . 1993 ) .",
    "similar features are seen in other supernovae of various spectral types with uv spectra ( bufano et al .",

    "note that at this redshift the continuum slopes redward of 4000    ( but not the spectral features ) also roughly agree .",
    "the comparison in figure 1 does not suggest that scp06f6 is either a type ia or a type ii , but that scp06f6 might have ca ii and iron - peak absorption in the rest - frame uv moving with velocities typical of supernovae . for reference",

    "the same is not true for the redshift of 0.143 where hydrogen might be present in emission or absorption for a variety of models , including those not based on supernovae .    to approximate the bolometric lightcurve of scp06f6 we use the vlt spectrum at maximum ( barbary et al .",
    "2008 ) scaled to the i- and z- band fluxes observed at the same epoch .",
    "we then approximate the sed of the object with a triangle peaked at 6000  that extends from 3000 to 12,000   .",
    "we calculate the integral to get the quasi - bolometric flux at maximum light , @xmath15 .",
    "this approximate method gives @xmath16 @xmath17 which is in good agreement with the estimated value of @xmath18 @xmath17 given in barbary et al .",
    "we then scale the flux to the other epochs using the photometry in table 1 of barbary et al .",
    "( 2008 ) assuming that the shape of the sed is roughly constant .",
    "we use the following formula to obtain bolometric luminosities : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the luminosity distance of the object which is equal to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the speed of light , @xmath23 is the redshift of the object and @xmath24 @xmath25 is the hubble constant .",
    "this expression for @xmath20 corresponds to an empty universe and is a good approximation to the full @xmath26-cdm expression .",
    "we adopt the arnett ( 1982 ) radioactive decay diffusion model as generalized by valenti et al .",
    "( 2008 ; see also soderberg et al .",
    "2008 ) to allow for both nickel and subsequent cobalt decay .",
    "we also allow for gamma - ray leakage .",
    "this simple model assumes a diffusive medium with a uniform density profile and a photosphere that expands linearly in time . in general , the solutions we find for scp06f6 imply large nickel and ejecta masses . with these assumptions ,",
    "we adopt the following expression for the diffusive luminosity released as a result of radioactive decay : @xmath27(1-e^{-at^{-2}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is * the rise time to maximum ( arnett 2008 ) * , @xmath30 with @xmath318.8 days , @xmath32 with @xmath33111.3 days , @xmath34 is the initial nickel mass , @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath36 are the energy generation rates due to ni and co decay .",
    "the factor @xmath38 accounts for the gamma - ray leakage , where large @xmath39 means that practically all gamma rays are trapped .",
    "the gamma - ray optical depth of the ejecta is taken to be @xmath40 , assuming spherical uniform density ejecta with radius @xmath41 and the ni / co confined in the center .",
    "this yields @xmath42 which is controlled by the gamma - ray opacity @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 scaling follows from homologous expansion which is one of the basic assumptions of the simple analytic models that we adopt here .",
    "in general we find the effect of gamma - ray leakage to be small for the large masses implied in our models .",
    "thus we have three main fitting parameters that determine the nature of the model light curve : the initial @xmath8ni mass that determines its peak , the rise time to maximum @xmath29 that determines its width and @xmath39 that determines the amount of gamma ray trapping and corresponds to a gamma - ray opacity .",
    "it is characteristic that , within this class of model , the nickel mass comes in only as a scaling parameter for the amplitude of the luminosity output .",
    "the more distant the source is , the brighter it is , since its intrinsic ( rest frame ) luminosity is higher compared to the observed luminosity .",
    "we thus expect a higher initial @xmath8ni mass at higher redshifts .    unlike the maximum brightness",
    ", the width of the light curve in the object rest frame decreases with respect to its observed value , since the rest frame rise time , @xmath45 , decreases with redshift : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the observed * rise * time . assuming that the photosphere expands with approximately constant speed , @xmath48",
    ", we adopt the ejecta mass as a function of * the observed rise time * given by valenti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) : @xmath49 where @xmath14 is an integration constant equal to about 13.8 ( arnett 1982 ; valenti et al . 2008 ) , @xmath50 is the mean opacity , and we have used @xmath51 , as appropriate for the outer edge of a homologously expanding sphere of constant density with ejecta mass @xmath52 and kinetic energy @xmath53 .",
    "the ejecta mass is set by the rise time to maximum that depends on the redshift of the object .",
    "thus we obtain a scaling of the ejecta mass with redshift within the context of this model for scp06f6 .",
    "the photospheric velocity of supernova ejecta is estimated from the width of lines in their spectra . for type ii supernovae",
    "it typically varies within the range @xmath54  @xmath55 , and for type ia supernovae it is typically @xmath56  @xmath55 .",
    "we note that the features of scp06f6 are generally broader than those of the type iip template of figure 1 and perhaps more represented by the features of the type ia .",
    "barbary et al . (",
    "2008 ) give @xmath57  @xmath55 .",
    "we adopt @xmath58  @xmath55 as a fiducial value and assume this to refer to the photospheric velocity in the rest frame of the supernova * for the models presented in  4 . * with assumed values of opacity we attempt to fit the observed light curve and to obtain constraints on physical properties of scp06f6 that will in turn scale as a function of the redshift .",
    "the light curve presented by barbary et al ( 2008 ) is roughly symmetric about the peak .",
    "the fact that scp06f6 shows a symmetric light curve is not in contradiction with observed supernovae characteristics .",
    "there are cases such as the type ib supernova sn2005bf ( tominaga et al . 2005 ) for which the second peak has a very symmetric light curve . as we will show below , our simple radioactive diffusion models have difficulty accounting for the low values of the points 100 days after peak and hence reproducing the symmetric light curve .",
    "there are several factors that might account for this discrepancy .",
    "the fundamental assumption of the model of  3.1 is that the ejecta are optically thick",
    ". that may not be true at the last observed epoch .",
    "an expression for the optical depth at maximum light can be written as : @xmath59 using the expression for @xmath60 from equation 4 and the kinematic radius @xmath61 gives @xmath62 , independent of redshift . for a photospheric velocity of 10,000 km s@xmath63",
    ", the optical depth would be about 30 , thus justifying the assumption of large optical depth at maximum light . using the black body radius",
    "gives a similar estimate of large optical depth , but one that varies with redshift .    as the ejecta expand the optical depth decreases as @xmath64 .",
    "for constant opacity the optical depth at epoch 11 of barbary et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ( table 1 ) is thus @xmath65 for @xmath66 , @xmath67  100 d and @xmath68  170 d. if the opacity dropped by a factor of several after maximum due to recombination in some element or elements , the light curve might decline more rapidly than our models .    to incorporate the effects of recombination we use the model developed by arnett & fu ( 1989 ) to fit the light curve of sn1987a",
    "this model considers the effects of the recombination of hydrogen or helium .",
    "after peak luminosity the recombination front recedes inwards and the optical opacity drops dramatically . thus the thermal energy generated by the presumed shock diffuses out more quickly and the decline is faster than it would be without recombination . *",
    "the light curve that results from this model depends on the following input parameters : the initial radius of the progenitor @xmath69 , the nickel mass yield @xmath34 , the mass of the ejecta @xmath52 , the kinetic and the thermal energy @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively , the ionization temperature @xmath72 and the optical opacity @xmath50 .",
    "the values that we used to obtain the fits shown in figure 2 are summarized in table 2 .",
    "also given in table 2 is the mean ejecta velocity , @xmath73 implied by the model fits .",
    "the amount of nickel needed to power the event in the recombination model is less than it is if the recombination effects are not taken into account , as expected .",
    "specifically @xmath74 for both redshift models , where @xmath75 is the mass of nickel that is required to power the peak of the light curve if the recombination effects are taken into account .",
    "*    as seen in figure 2 , * a recombination model * can produce a roughly symmetric light curve around the peak that subsequently follows the cobalt decay . * in our model for scp06f6",
    "we consider the composition of the ejecta unknown and we adopt the thompson scattering opacity values of 0.4 @xmath76 at @xmath770.143 , ( a typical value for a h - rich envelope ) and 0.2 @xmath76 at @xmath770.57 ( a typical value for a h - poor envelope ) . *",
    "as noted in  2 there is no evidence for hydrogen or helium in the spectrum of scp06f6 , but if it is at a redshift of 0.57 , then the h@xmath13 line would be redshifted out of the range of the spectral converage by vlt and subaru as shown in barbary et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and h@xmath14 would be contaminated by telluric lines ( figure 1 ) .",
    "* we are not able to accurately reproduce the light curve of scp06f6 , even when the recombination effects are taken into account , especially due to the fact that we can not fit epoch 11 of barbary et al .",
    "it should be noted that the purpose of the recombination models that we consider is to illustrate the effects of this process on the light curve of a sn , and to show that recombination does tend to make the light curve more symmetric around the peak .",
    "more detailed models accounting for the density , composition and optical depth structure and appropriate radiative transfer are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "*      there could also be dust formation at late epochs . at epoch 11 ( table 1 ,",
    "barbary et al 2008 ) the observed flux is @xmath5 7 times lower than the flux that is predicted by the model * ( insensitive to redshift ) . *",
    "thus we can estimate the optical depth due to a hypothetical dust absorption using the formula @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the flux at epoch 11 , @xmath80 is the flux at epoch 11 as predicted by the radioactive decay diffusion model and @xmath81 is the dust optical depth .",
    "this yields @xmath82 if we consider a spherical , optically thin dust shell at the outer edge of the sn ejecta with radius @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 and thickness @xmath86 .",
    "the required dust mass is then @xmath87 , and the dust optical depth @xmath88 . combining these equations yields @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the opacity of the dust grains .",
    "we adopt the value @xmath91 @xmath76 as a gross estimate , using the draine ( 2003 ) model extinction curves for milky way dust grain composition . for this choice of parameters",
    "we estimate the dust mass to be @xmath92  @xmath93 .",
    "this value is in agreement with values that are estimated for other type - ii supernovae ( kotak et al . 2005 ; kotak et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "if the dust formation took place well inside the ejecta , for example at @xmath94  1000 km  s@xmath63 , as in type ii - p sne ( kotak et al . 2009 ) , then the dust mass would be 100 times higher than the value estimated above , on the order of 0.02@xmath93 .",
    "this is somewhat higher than has been observed in other sne , but still not unrealistic , taking into account that the dust masses derived in this way are only lower limits . if the dust distribution is not uniform and optically thin but rather it is distributed in optically thick clumps ( ercolano et al . , 2007 )",
    ", then the total dust mass could be much higher than that derived from the optically - thin model .",
    "note that the energy absorbed by dust is expected to be re - radiated as mid - ir photons after the dust particles ( or clumps ) are heated up to @xmath95 ",
    "@xmath96 k. thus , strictly speaking , the true bolometric luminosity remains unchanged in this case . in  2 , we estimated the bolometric luminosity by assuming that all radiation comes from the optical and near - ir regime . the arnett model ( equation 2 ) also uses essentially the same assumption due to the thermalization of the gamma - rays .",
    "within this context the optical photons absorbed by dust can be considered as  lost , \" even though their energy is expected to re - appear as a mid - ir excess , outside the original sed .",
    "* here we calculate the redshift dependence of the physical parameters of the arnett model given in equation 2 , without recombination .",
    "* figure 3 shows how the ejecta mass and the nickel mass depend on redshift based on fits to the light curve for various choices of the mean opacity . *",
    "the recombination models have the same redshift dependence , but the nickel masses are about 40% lower , the ejecta masses are about 30% lower and the kinetic energies are lower by a factor of 2 to 3 compared to our fiducial models with the same opacity . * the ejecta mass * for the basic radioactive diffusion models * is calculated using equation 4 adopting @xmath97  d for the rise time to maximum in the observer s frame and adopting @xmath58 km s@xmath63 as the fiducial velocity .",
    "the nickel mass is calculated by assuming @xmath98 and solving equation 2 for @xmath34 given the observed value of maximum luminosity , which scales with redshift according to equation 2 .",
    "we consider values of the mean opacity ranging from 0.05 @xmath76 as might be representative of a metal - rich composition ( sutherland & wheeler 1984 ; soderberg et al .",
    "2008 ) up to 0.40 @xmath76 as might be representative of electron scattering in a pure hydrogen plasma .",
    "figure 3 also shows the best fitting results for the nickel mass and the ejecta mass in the case of @xmath50=0.1 @xmath76 for the same redshift range and with redshift increments of 0.1 ( filled circles and squares respectively ) . to determine the best fitting parameters ( @xmath34 , @xmath29 and @xmath39 ) for each redshift we developed a simple monte carlo chi - square minimization code that scans through all the parameter space and finds the minimum @xmath99 value and the parameters that correspond to that value .",
    "as can be seen in figure 3 , the best fitting results are in very good agreement with the analytic ones assuming @xmath97  d * as a fixed parameter*.    the region above redshift of @xmath51.1 is forbidden since the required nickel mass would exceed the required ejecta mass to account for the width of the light curve even for rather small opacity .",
    "the region to the right of the dashed vertical line at @xmath1000.8 ( for @xmath50=0.1 @xmath101 g@xmath63 ) is also forbidden in practice because it is unlikely that the nickel mass exceeds half the total ejecta mass in an astrophysically realistic model of , for example , a pair - formation or core - collapse supernova .",
    "these redshift limits get tighter for larger mean opacities or lower photospheric velocities . for electron scattering in a pure ionized hydrogen plasma ,",
    "the redshift would have to be less than about 0.65 for this sort of model to be self - consistent . *",
    "invoking recombination does not change this constraint substantially since @xmath102 is about the same ( tables 1,2 ) . * a nickel mass of 1m@xmath4 that would be characteristic of a type ia",
    "is obtained at a redshift of about 0.3 . at this redshift",
    ", the ejecta would exceed 30  m@xmath4 for a mean opacity of @xmath103 @xmath76 , so the explosion is certainly not that of an exploding white dwarf .",
    "figure 4 shows the scaling with redshift of the kinetic energy , e@xmath104 , and the total radiated energy , e@xmath105 .",
    "the kinetic energy is determined from the ejecta mass , assuming a mean velocity of @xmath106 km s@xmath63 and the same range of mean opacity as before .",
    "note that the kinetic energy is especially sensitive to the assumed photospheric velocity , scaling as e@xmath107 @xmath108 ( from equation 4 ) . *",
    "the more tightly - constrained recombination models require a lower @xmath109 and hence @xmath110 than our fiducial radioactive diffusion models ( table 2 ) .",
    "this raises the possibility that our fiducial models presented here and in figure 4 overestimate the ejecta velocity and kinetic energy . *",
    "the radiated energy is obtained by integrating the bolometric luminosity over the whole light curve . since a strong",
    "shock distributes energy equally between kinetic energy and thermal energy in its wake and some thermal energy is likely to be subsequently converted to kinetic energy by adiabatic expansion and pdv work , it is unlikely that the radiated energy can exceed the kinetic energy .",
    "this constraint gives another limit on the redshift , z @xmath111 1.1 for @xmath50=0.1 @xmath101 g@xmath63 , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "note that if the opacity were larger or the photospheric velocity smaller , this constraint also gets tighter .",
    "an estimate of the radius of the photosphere can be obtained from kinematics ( @xmath112 ) or emissivity ( a blackbody radius ) .",
    "figure 5 gives the radius estimated at maximum light in these two ways assuming a constant rest frame photospheric velocity of 10,000 km s@xmath63 and a constant rest frame blackbody temperature of 5000 k. note that these two estimates only agree at a single redshift .",
    "each estimate is uncertain , so we also denote the range over which the radii agree within a factor of two or a factor of three .",
    "the latter restricts the range of redshift to z @xmath5 0.2  0.9 .",
    "another consistency check follows from noticing that the slope of the continuum varies little over the three epochs for which spectra were given by barbary et al .",
    "we have estimated the effective temperature in our models at these epochs using the bolometric luminosity and the kinematic radius from figure 5 .",
    "the effective temperature derived this way ( that is formally 5000 k at z@xmath50.5 ) varies by @xmath111 300 k over the spectral epochs , basically consistent with the observations .",

    "gamma - ray leakage is not an important effect for the large masses derived .",
    "the initial nickel mass is within the range expected for typical sne while the ejecta mass is rather large , due to the fact that scp06f6 shows a significantly slow rise to maximum and a slow decline .",

    "there are two versions of this circumstance . in the model of smith & mccray ( 2007 ) , the csm shell is optically thick and the light curve is controlled by diffusion .",
    "alternatively , the csm could be optically thin enough to radiate the shock collision energy  instantaneously , \" but optically thick enough to convert the shock energy to optical radiation . in the case where the energy release is dominated by diffusion ,",
    "the energy to power the light curve arises in the putative collision of the supernova ejecta with the extended dense csm .",
    "* there is no need for any radioactive input to power the light curve near maximum light , although some contribution from that source can not be ruled out .",
    "* this class of model gives no simple way to estimate the maximum luminosity in terms of physical input parameters .",

    "an extreme version of this class of model is obtained with the assumption that the initial radius of the circumstellar shell was not far from the observed radius of the photosphere at maximum light so that adiabatic losses within the shell are assumed to be minimal . in this case , the post - shock thermal energy content of the csm envelope should be roughly comparable to the radiated energy and to the kinetic energy and both should be roughly comparable to the initial supernova shock energy , the kinetic energy of the underlying supernova ( within factors of two ) .",
    "these aspects mean that , except for this  extreme \" version , there is no simple way to determine a physical parameter analogous to the initial nickel mass in the radioactive diffusion model derived from the light curve peak . on the other hand",
    ", this model still assumes that the luminous output derives from the diffusion of thermal energy from within the optically - thick ejecta . in this case , the mass of the ejecta that determines the width of the light curve is roughly the sum of the underlying supernova ejecta and the mass of the shocked csm matter ( smith & mccray 2007 ) , and the tools presented in  3 still allow a determination of this effective mass as a function of redshift .    if the optical depth is small enough that the diffusion time for the release of post - shock energy is short , then the luminosity released as the csm is shocked is given by ( ofek et al .",

    "the light curve can be reproduced by a suitable , although entirely _ ad hoc _ , assumption of a density profile .",
    "we also note that while some information on the mass ejected into the csm can be estimated , this model provides no useful separate information on the ejecta mass analogous to the constraint of the rise time to maximum .",
    "there is thus also no independent constraint on the associated kinetic energy .    for the csm diffusion models , the width of the light curve yields an estimate of the diffusion time and hence the ejecta mass from equation 4 .",

    "assuming a temperature of 5000 k in the rest frame of the supernova ( gaensicke et al . , 2008 ) , the black body radius at maximum light is @xmath135 cm . the rather large discrepancy in these two methods for estimating the radius near maximum light suggests a basic inconsistency in the diffusion models for this smaller redshift .",
    "following the same method for the z=0.57 case , we find that the blackbody radius is @xmath136 cm while the kinematic radius at maximum light is @xmath137 cm .",
    "this represents generally good agreement .",
    "if the true blackbody radius at maximum light were much higher , this model might be strained .",
    "the significantly low fraction of radiation energy compared to the kinetic energy for the model at z = 0.143 , @xmath138 (  4.3 ) , implies that there must have been substantial adiabatic losses for this csm diffusion model to be viable , unless the opacity is substantially larger than the fiducial value of @xmath1390.1 @xmath140 g@xmath63 ( see figure 4 ) and the photospheric velocity substantially lower . for the case at z = 0.57 , the radiated energy is again estimated to be small compared to the kinetic energy , but rather modest changes in the fiducial parameters ( larger opacity , smaller velocity ) could make the radiated energy comparable to the kinetic energy . in this case",
    ", the light curve could be accounted for by the collision of an underlying supernova with a large , dense , csm shell .",
    "for this situation , with negligible adiabatic losses , the energy of the underlying supernova would be about twice the radiated energy , or about @xmath141 ergs .",
    "the estimate of * optical depth * near maximum light , @xmath66 , from equation 5 also applies to this diffusion model .",
    "this constant value of opacity is given as the horizontal dashed line in figure 6 .",
    "because a csm envelope is likely to be of relatively large opacity , the shock diffusion model may be appropriate to this redshift .",

    "it is possible that the reported detection should instead be treated as an upper limit ( d. pooley , private communication ) .",

    "the energy of the underlying explosion could be more modest .",
    "these models demand substantial mass in the csm and hence effective mass loss rates that are reminiscent of lbv mass - loss episodes .",
    "models in which the csm is only modestly optically thick so the energy can be thermalized but also radiated rapidly could be applicable at higher redshifts .",
    "such models might be consistent with mass loss rates reminiscent of wolf - rayet stars , but to match the shape of the light curve , the density profile would need to be carefully contrived , an unlikely happenstance .",
