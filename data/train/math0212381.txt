    "recently , feighn and handel proved the remarkable positive result that the mapping torus of any injective endomorphism of a free group is coherent @xcite .",
    "their theorem is related to the coherence of @xmath1-manifolds in the following sense .",
    "many @xmath1-manifolds arise as surface bundles over a circle , and their fundamental groups are thus isomorphic to extensions of surface groups by  @xmath2 .",
    "the result of @xcite shows that extensions of free groups by @xmath2 are also coherent , thus extending the often successful analogy between free groups and surface groups .",
    "the current investigation was primarily motivated by the following open problem which has remained unresolved for over thirty years with very little forward progress :    problem(g.baumslag , @xcite ) is every one - relator group coherent ?    in this article",
    "we describe a criterion which , if successful , allows one to conclude that the group under consideration is coherent .",
    "the criterion involves a new notion which we call `` perimeter '' . roughly speaking ,",
    "given a map @xmath3 between 2-complexes , the perimeter of @xmath4 which we denote by @xmath5 , is a measure of how large the `` boundary '' of @xmath4 is relative to @xmath6 .",
    "the strategy underlying the results in this paper is that if @xmath3 is unsatisfactory , because for instance , it is not @xmath7-injective , then some @xmath0-cells can be added to @xmath4 which reduce the perimeter , and after repeating this finitely many times , we obtain a satisfactory map between @xmath0-complexes .",
    "we will now state several of our main results .",
    "all of the undefined terminology , such as perimeter , weighted @xmath0-complex , and the various hypotheses will be explained in the course of the article .",
    "the main coherence result is the following :    let @xmath6 be a weighted @xmath0-complex which satisfies the perimeter reduction hypothesis .",
    "\\a ) if @xmath4 is a compact connected subcomplex of a cover @xmath8 of @xmath6 , and the inclusion @xmath9 is not @xmath7-injective , then @xmath4 is contained in a compact connected subcomplex @xmath10 such that @xmath11 .",
    "\\b ) for any compact subcomplex @xmath12 , there exists a compact connected subcomplex @xmath4 containing @xmath13 , such that @xmath5 is minimal among all such compact connected subcomplexes containing @xmath13 .",
    "consequently @xmath14 is coherent .",
    "a geometric consequence of theorem  [ thm : gct ] is the following :    let @xmath6 be a weighted aspherical @xmath0-complex which satisfies the perimeter reduction hypothesis . if @xmath15 is a covering space and @xmath16 is finitely generated , then every compact subcomplex of @xmath8 is contained in a compact core of @xmath8 .",
    "a subspace @xmath4 of a geodesic metric space @xmath6 is quasiconvex if there is an @xmath17 neighborhood of @xmath4 which contains all of the geodesics in @xmath6 which start and end in @xmath4 .",
    "in group theory , a subgroup @xmath18 of a group @xmath19 generated by @xmath20 is quasiconvex if the @xmath21-cells corresponding to @xmath18 form a quasiconvex subspace of the cayley graph @xmath22 .",
    "the next main result in this article is a criterion which , if satisfied , allows one to conclude that a group is locally quasiconvex , i.e. that all finitely generated subgroups are quasiconvex .",
    "as the reader will observe from some of the applications described below , most of the groups which we can show are coherent also satisfy this stronger criterion , and thus will be locally quasiconvex as well .",
    "the exact relationship between the two criteria will become clear in the course of the article .",
    "our main quasiconvexity theorem is the following :    let @xmath6 be a compact weighted @xmath0-complex . if @xmath6 satisfies the straightening hypothesis , then every finitely generated subgroup of @xmath14 embeds by a quasi - isometry .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath14 is word - hyperbolic then it is locally quasiconvex .",
    "the statements of the perimeter reduction hypothesis definition  [ def : prh ] and the straightening hypothesis ( definition  [ def : qrh ] ) are rather technical , but the strength of the theorems above can be illustrated easily through some explicit consequences that we now describe .",
    "first of all , as a consequence of theorem  [ thm : gct ] we obtain the following result :    let @xmath23 be a cyclically reduced word and let @xmath24 . if @xmath25 , then @xmath19 is coherent .",
    "in particular , for every word @xmath23 , the group @xmath24 is coherent provided that @xmath26 is sufficiently large .    with a slightly stronger requirement on the degree of torsion",
    ", we can obtain the following consequence of theorem  [ thm : lqc ] :    let @xmath27 be a one - relator group with @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath19 is locally quasiconvex .",
    "a similar result holds for multi - relator groups :    let @xmath29 be a finite presentation , where each @xmath30 is a cyclically reduced word which is not a proper power . if @xmath30 is not freely conjugate to @xmath31 for @xmath32 , then there exists a number @xmath33 such that for all choices of integers @xmath34 the group @xmath35 is coherent . specifically , the number @xmath36    has this property , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote longest and shortest words among the @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "moreover , if @xmath39 for all @xmath40 , then @xmath19 is locally quasiconvex .",
    "a small - cancellation application with a different flavor is the following :    let @xmath41 be a small cancellation presentation which satisfies @xmath42 .",
    "if each @xmath43 occurs at most @xmath44 times among the @xmath45 , then @xmath19 is coherent and locally quasiconvex .",
    "more precise applications to additional groups which are important in geometric group theory can be found in sections  [ sec:1relator ] , [ sec:2-cell - small ] ,  [ sec : sc - lqc ] , and  [ sec : manifold ] .",
    "many of the individual results derived in these sections can be summarized by the following qualitative description :    qualitative summary if a presentation has a large number of generators relative to the sum of the lengths of the relators , and the relators are relatively long and sufficiently spread out among the generators , then the group is coherent and locally quasiconvex .",
    "the main triumph of these ideas , is that while we have only partially solved baumslag s problem , we have substantially answered the problem raised by c.t.c .",
    "wall of whether small - cancellation groups are coherent @xcite . in a separate paper @xcite",
    ", we give a much more detailed application of the strongest results in this paper to small - cancellation groups .",
    "furthermore , families of examples are constructed there which show that the applications to small - cancellation theory are asymptotically sharp .",
    "an application of our theory towards the local quasiconvexity of one - relator groups with torsion is given in @xcite , an application towards the coherence of various other one - relator groups is given in @xcite , and an application towards the subgroup separability of coxeter groups is given in @xcite .",
    "we conclude this introduction with a brief section - by - section description of the article .",
    "the concept of the perimeter of a map is introduced in section  [ sec : perimeter ] and it is from this concept that all of our positive results are derived . section  [ sec : gch ] shows how this concept leads to the notion of a perimeter reduction and it also contains our general coherence theorem .",
    "sections  [ sec : attachments ] , [ sec:2cell ] , and [ sec : pathct ] develop the specific case where the perimeter can be reduced through the addition of a single @xmath0-cell .",
    "the proofs lead to procedures which are completely algorithmic .",
    "these algorithmic approaches are described in section  [ sec : algorithms ] .",
    "in particular we show that for the groups included in the @xmath0-cell coherence theorem there exists an algorithm to compute an explicit finite presentation for an arbitrary finitely generated subgroup . additionally , we show that the time it takes to produce such a finite presentation is quadratic in the total length of its set of generators .",
    "section  [ sec : pathct ] presents a more technical theorem about coherence using sequences of paths . in section  [ sec:1relator ] the theory developed in the first half of the article is applied to the class of one - relator groups with torsion .",
    "similarly , section  [ sec:2-cell - small ] presents some background on small cancellation theory , and gives some applications of the theory to the coherence of small cancellation groups .",
    "as this work has evolved over the past six years , two things have become clear : first of all , a much richer collection of positive results can be obtained by attaching `` fans '' of 2-cells to reduce perimeter instead of attaching single @xmath0-cells . secondly , the most significant conclusion of the theory appears to be local quasiconvexity rather than coherence , and in fact , we know of no word - hyperbolic group which satisfies our coherence criterion but which is not locally - quasiconvex as well .",
    "the latter part of the paper introduces fans in the context of coherence theorems that utilize them .",
    "thereafter , fans are employed in the statements and proofs of the local quasiconvexity theorems .",
    "fans are defined in section  [ sec : fanct ] , where the general theory is extended by incorporating fans into the statements and arguments .",
    "section  [ sec : quasi ] contains basic definitions and results about quasiconvexity which we will need , and section  [ sec : lqc - main ] presents our main theorem about local quasiconvexity . in section  [ sec : sc - lqc ] we return to small cancellation groups , and give additional coherence applications as well as some local quasiconvexity applications .",
    "section  [ sec : manifold ] uses these applications to small cancellation groups to obtain results about @xmath1-manifold groups .",
    "while the coherence of @xmath1-manifold groups has long been known , when successful , our method gives a different approach towards understanding the reasons behind this remarkable theorem .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : other ] , we describe theorems and algorithms related to the finitely generated intersection property and the generalized word problem .",
    "the main goal of this section is to introduce the notion of the perimeter of a @xmath0-complex @xmath4 relative to a particular map @xmath46 .",
    "we begin with a number of basic definitions and the definition of the unit perimeter . in the second half of the section",
    "we broaden the definition to allow for the introduction of weights .",
