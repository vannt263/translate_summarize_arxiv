    "on exhaustion of nuclear fuels , the core of a massive star ( @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the mass of the sun ) undergoes gravitational collapse , thereby initiating the supernova process .",
    "two classes of signals are expected from such an event : the neutrinos emitted by the proto - neutron star formed from the collapsed core and the photons radiated as the supernova shock emerges from the stellar surface .",
    "the neutrino signals start immediately after the shock is launched and last for @xmath5  s. however , it takes several hours for the shock to emerge , and consequently , the associated photon radiation , in particular the optical display , is delayed from the neutrino burst by this shock propagation time . in this paper",
    "we consider a third class of signals that occur before the shock emergence .",
    "these signals are @xmath1 rays induced by neutrino reactions in the stellar envelope .",
    "we assume that the star undergoing core collapse still has its hydrogen envelope . as the neutrinos from the proto - neutron star stream through this envelope ,",
    "the reaction @xmath9 produces a neutron and a positron .",
    "subsequently , the capture of the neutron through @xmath10 produces a @xmath1 ray of 2.22  mev , and the annihilation of the positron can produce two @xmath1 rays of 0.511 mev each .",
    "the above mechanism of @xmath1-ray emission from supernovae has been considered earlier by refs .",
    "@xcite . however , these studies only estimated the expected @xmath1-ray fluxes without giving an analysis of all the physical processes involved in the @xmath1-ray production .",
    "for example , the thermalization of neutrons and positrons in the stellar envelope was not discussed , and neither was the detailed time structure of the @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "we note that @xmath1 rays from neutron capture on protons and positron annihilation were also discussed in the context of solar flares ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and interstellar medium ( see e.g. , ref .",

    "we here present detailed analyses of the major physical processes that lead to @xmath1-ray production following the reaction @xmath11 in the hydrogen envelope of a massive star .",
    "in particular , we show that the @xmath1-ray emission due to neutron capture on protons lasts for @xmath12  s while that due to positron annihilation follows the time evolution of the @xmath0 luminosity and lasts for @xmath5  s. for concreteness , we adopt a specific model of neutrino emission and a specific stellar model for the conditions in the hydrogen envelope .",

    "the corresponding flux at a radius @xmath70 can be estimated as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the time at which the @xmath1 rays emitted at time @xmath73 arrive at radius @xmath74 and we have used @xmath75 in the second approximation . to show the dependence on the model of neutrino emission and stellar conditions , we rewrite the above equation as @xmath76",
    "it can be seen that the exact form of @xmath19 is unimportant so long as the timescale of neutrino emission is @xmath77 .",
    "in addition , the density of the stellar surface region controls the peak magnitude and the decay timescale of the flux via @xmath78 and @xmath68 , respectively . integrating the flux over time",

    "this dependence ceases only when neutron decay can be ignored ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) .",
    "as discussed above , the timescales for neutron capture onto protons and @xmath3he are @xmath82  s and @xmath83  s for the adopted density and composition of the stellar surface region .",

    "the region of interest has a temperature @xmath87  k corresponding to a thermal energy @xmath88  ev  @xmath89 with @xmath90 being boltzmann s constant .",

    "based on the discussion in the preceding subsections , a fraction @xmath122 of the positrons produced by @xmath0 absorption on protons directly annihilate and a fraction @xmath123 form ps before being thermalized , and the rest are thermalized on a timescale of @xmath124  s , which is much shorter than the timescale of @xmath23  s governing the production of the initial positrons .",
    "the positrons released by the breakup of @xmath3ps are also quickly thermalized .",
    "as the positrons are produced approximately isotropically , their spatial distribution can be taken as uniform before and after thermalization .",

    "detection of the @xmath1-ray fluxes quoted above is beyond the capability of current instruments , and perhaps even those planned for the near future .",

    "for example , both the peak and the decay timescale @xmath68 of the @xmath1-ray flux from neutron capture on protons depend on the density of the stellar surface region . a higher density decreases the timescales for neutron capture on protons ( @xmath78 ) and @xmath3he nuclei ( @xmath152 ) , which increases the peak flux and decreases @xmath68 .",
    "on the other hand , a higher @xmath3he abundance decreases @xmath152 , and hence @xmath68 , but does not affect the peak flux as neutron capture on @xmath3he nuclei consumes neutrons without producing any @xmath1 ray . as another example ,",
    "the rates for the breakup of @xmath3ps and the conversion of @xmath3ps into @xmath116ps are proportional to the density of the stellar surface region .",
    "while the @xmath1-ray flux from positron annihilation quoted above also applies approximately to higher densities than adopted here , for sufficiently smaller densities the @xmath3ps formed would predominantly decay into three @xmath1 rays with a continuous spectrum instead of being broken up or converted . this would decrease the flux of 0.511  mev @xmath1 rays from @xmath116ps decay . in the limit where no @xmath3ps are broken up or converted , this flux is reduced to 1/4 of the value estimated here .",

    "<S> during a core - collapse supernova , absorption of @xmath0 emitted from the proto - neutron star by protons in the hydrogen envelope produces neutrons and positrons . </S>",
    "<S> neutron capture on protons and positron annihilation then produce @xmath1 rays of 2.22 and 0.511  mev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the fluxes of these @xmath1 rays expected from a supernova with an @xmath2 progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> the flux from neutron capture on protons exponentially decays on a timescale of 564  s , which is determined by neutron decay and capture on protons and @xmath3he nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the peak flux is @xmath4 for a supernova at a distance of 1  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the @xmath1-ray flux from positron annihilation follows the time evolution of the @xmath0 luminosity and lasts for @xmath5  s. the peak flux in this case is @xmath6 for a supernova at a distance of 1  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> detection of the above @xmath1-ray fluxes is beyond the capability of current instruments , and perhaps even those planned for the near future . however , </S>",
    "<S> if such fluxes can be detected , they not only constitute a new kind of signals that occur during the gap of several hours between the neutrino signals and the optical display of a supernova , but may also provide a useful probe of the conditions in the surface layers of the supernova progenitor . </S>"
