    "the field of @xmath7 quantum mechanics @xcite has attracted significant interest in recent years and a large community of active researchers has developed .",
    "this area of study began with the observation that the complex @xmath7-symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath8 has a positive real discrete eigenspectrum @xcite .",
    "the property of @xmath7 symmetry is not sufficient to guarantee that the eigenvalues of a non - hermitian hamiltonian are real ; @xmath7 symmetry merely ensures that the _ secular determinant _",
    "@xmath9 is a real function of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath11 are the roots of @xmath12 and thus the condition of @xmath7 symmetry implies that the eigenvalues are either real or come in complex - conjugate pairs .",
    "if the eigenvalues of a @xmath7-symmetric hamiltonian are all real , we say that the hamiltonian has an _ unbroken _ @xmath7 symmetry , but if there are any complex eigenvalues , we say that the @xmath7 symmetry of @xmath11 is _",
    "broken_.    lacking further information , one would expect ( [ e2 ] ) to have some complex roots .",
    "thus , it was surprising to find that the class of @xmath7-symmetric hamiltonians ( [ e1 ] ) has an entirely real spectrum . in refs .",
    "@xcite numerical evidence and detailed perturbative asymptotic analysis was presented to show that the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) are real when @xmath13 . a rigorous proof that these eigenvalues are all real was given by dorey , dunning , and tateo @xcite .    using the wkb quantization condition @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the _ turning points _ [ roots of @xmath17",
    ", one can understand heuristically why the eigenvalues of @xmath11 in ( [ e1 ] ) cease to be real when @xmath18 .",
    "the quantization condition ( [ e3 ] ) requires that there be a continuous integration contour from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "such a contour exists for @xmath19 , but as soon as @xmath20 goes below @xmath21 , the contour joining @xmath15 and @xmath16 is broken by the existence of a branch cut in the complex-@xmath22 plane and there is no longer a finite - length path connecting the turning points .    the discovery that the eigenvalues of @xmath11 in ( [ e1 ] ) are real led to a search for and subsequent study of other non - hermitian @xmath7-symmetric hamiltonians whose spectra are also real @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the reality of the eigenspectrum is an unusual property of a complex hamiltonian and that many @xmath7-symmetric hamiltonians do not have entirely real spectra .",
    "for example , while the @xmath23 potential studied in refs .",
    "@xcite has a real ground - state energy , it has recently been found that some of the other eigenvalues are complex @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we conjecture that analyticity of the potential is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) criterion for a non - dirac - hermitian hamiltonian to have real eigenvalues .",
    "this conjecture is based on extensive numerical studies in which we have found that , except in rare cases , a @xmath7-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath24 does not have a real spectrum if its potential @xmath3 is not an analytic function of @xmath22 .",
    "an example of such a nonanalytic @xmath7-symmetric potential , which is discussed in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] , is @xmath25 we show in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] that this potential has only one real eigenvalue .",
    "a heuristic explanation of the role played by analyticity can be based on the wkb contour integral in ( [ e3 ] ) . for complex @xmath7-symmetric potentials the derivation and application of this integral makes explicit use of the analyticity of the potential .",
    "of course , the potential of a hermitian hamiltonian need not be analytic because its turning points lie on the real axis . here",
    ", the integral for the wkb quantization condition is unambiguously taken along the real axis and does not need to be deformed into the complex plane .",
    "by contrast , the turning points for a complex potential are likely to be complex , and thus the contour for the wkb integral necessarily lies off the real axis . giving up hermiticity forces the quantization condition ( [ e3 ] ) into the complex plane and thus introduces the requirement of path independence and hence analyticity .    the square - well potential studied by znojil in ref .",
    "@xcite is a rare example of a complex nonanalytic @xmath7-symmetric potential having a real spectrum .",
    "this potential evades the conjecture above simply because there are no turning points at all ; for the square - well potential there is no solution to the equation @xmath26 .",
    "this paper is organized very simply : in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] we examine the exactly solvable nonanalytic potential in ( [ e4 ] ) and in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] we present numerical results for the class of nonanalytic @xmath7-symmetric potentials @xmath27 in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] we make some brief concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we consider the @xmath7-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath28 whose potential is a nonanalytic function of @xmath22 .",
    "the schrdinger eigenvalue differential equation associated with this hamiltonian is @xmath29 where @xmath22 is real and where the eigenfunction @xmath30 is required to obey the boundary conditions that @xmath31 as @xmath2 .",
    "to solve this differential equation , we partition the real axis into two regions . in the region @xmath32 the differential equation ( [ e7 ] ) takes the form @xmath33 and the exact solution is @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the parabolic cylinder function with @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are arbitrary constants . the boundary condition",
    "@xmath39 implies that @xmath40 .",
    "thus , for @xmath32 we have @xmath41    similarly , in the region @xmath42 the differential equation ( [ e7 ] ) becomes @xmath43 whose exact solution is @xmath44 here , @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are arbitrary constants .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath48 implies that @xmath49 .",
    "thus , for @xmath42 we have @xmath50    we must patch the two solutions ( [ e11 ] ) and ( [ e15 ] ) together at the origin @xmath51 .",
    "continuity of @xmath30 at @xmath51 implies that @xmath52 and continuity of @xmath53 at @xmath51 implies that @xmath54 taking the ratio of ( [ e17 ] ) and ( [ e16 ] ) eliminates the constants @xmath37 and @xmath47 and gives the following exact equation for the eigenvalues : @xmath55 this condition can be rewritten simply in terms of gamma functions as @xmath56 as required by @xmath7 symmetry , the secular equation ( [ e19 ] ) is a _ real _ function of @xmath10 .",
    "this is so because it is the sum of two terms that are complex conjugates of each other .",
    "to solve ( [ e19 ] ) for @xmath10 , we substitute @xmath57 and take the real and imaginary parts of the resulting equation .",
    "we then plot in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the curves in the complex-@xmath10 plane along which the real part of ( [ e19 ] ) vanishes ( solid line ) and the imaginary part of ( [ e19 ] ) vanishes ( dotted line ) .",
    "[ of course , the condition of @xmath7 symmetry requires that the dotted line lie along the real-@xmath10 axis .",
    "however , note that the real-@xmath10 axis is not the only curve along which the imaginary part of ( [ e19 ] ) vanishes . ]",
    "the intersections of the solid and dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] are the eigenvalues of @xmath11 in ( [ e6 ] ) .",
    "note that there is only one real eigenvalue ; all other intersections occur in complex - conjugate pairs .",
    "the numerical value of the real eigenvalue is @xmath58",
    "in this section we examine numerically the eigenvalue differential equation for the complex @xmath7-symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are real parameters .",
    "we begin by determining the appropriate @xmath7-symmetric boundary conditions to be imposed on the eigenfunctions of @xmath11 in ( [ e21 ] ) . using wkb analysis",
    ", we find the possible asymptotic behaviors of the eigenfunction @xmath30 satisfying the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath62 for example , when @xmath32 , the controlling factor of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath30 as @xmath63 is @xmath64 .",
    "\\label{e23}\\ ] ] thus , for @xmath65 there exists a solution that grows exponentially and another that decays exponentially for large positive @xmath22 .",
    "the same is true for large negative @xmath22 so long as @xmath65 . to determine the eigenvalues for @xmath65 we impose the boundary conditions that @xmath66 as @xmath67 on the real-@xmath22 axis .",
    "note that because the potential is not an analytic function of @xmath22 , the notion of stokes wedges in the complex-@xmath22 plane in which the boundary conditions are imposed is not applicable .",
    "we have calculated the eigenvalues for various values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 and our results are listed in tables [ t1 ] and [ t2 ] and plotted in fig .",
    "clearly , when @xmath61 is an even integer , the hamiltonian in ( [ e21 ] ) reduces to that in ( [ e1 ] ) and it has an entirely real spectrum .",
    "however , for other values of @xmath61 , when @xmath68 there are only a finite number of real eigenvalues .",
