    "superfluidity , the capability of a fluid to flow without friction along a pipe or past an obstacle @xcite , is undoubtedly among the most striking phenomena occurring in low - temperature liquids or gases . since its first discovery in ^4^he @xcite , it has been observed in several other systems such as ^3^he @xcite or bosonic and fermionic ultracold atomic vapors @xcite .    following pioneering theoretical works @xcite ,",
    "superfluidity has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite also in the completely - different optical context of the so - called quantum fluids of light . in suitable optical devices ,",
    "a many - photon light beam can in fact behave collectively as a quantum fluid @xcite : effective photon - photon interactions are mediated by the kerr optical nonlinearity of the underlying medium , while photon confinement in a microcavity configuration or diffraction in a paraxial - propagation geometry provide a mass to the photon .",
    "a transparent way to probe the superfluid properties of the photon fluid is to introduce a spatially localized defect into its flow and look at the perturbation that this latter generates into the fluid . depending on the relative value of the flow speed compared to the sound speed , a full crossover has been revealed from a low - velocity superfluid regime , in which the flow remains practically unaffected by the presence of the obstacle @xcite , to a large - velocity regime characterized by the cherenkov emission of bogoliubov - like linear waves in the fluid and/or by the hydrodynamic nucleation of nonlinear excitations such as quantized vortices @xcite or dark solitons @xcite .    while the drop of the drag force experienced by the obstacle is among the main signatures of superfluidity in material fluids @xcite , so far all experiments on quantum fluids of light",

    "were theoretically carried out by several authors @xcite but no concrete experimental setup to effectively measure it has ever been proposed .",
    "the purpose of this work is to fill this gap and propose a configuration where the drag force generated by a flowing photon fluid onto an obstacle may be actually measured .    as compared to the planer - microcavity architecture used in the superfluid - light experiments of refs .",

    "this condition is essential to have an observable mechanical displacement and/or a deformation of the obstacle in response to the radiation pressure . according to our predictions ,",
    "the transition to a superfluid state is in fact signaled by a sudden drop of the drag force corresponding to the radiation pressure and , therefore , of the optomechanical deformation of the obstacle .",

    "the fact that such a value is smaller than the obstacle thickness @xmath8 justifies a posteriori our hypothesis of a @xmath6-independent obstacle . on the other hand ,",
    "such a value is well within the sensitivity range of state - of - the - art small - displacement measurements ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    the disappearance of the deformation when entering the superfluid regime will provide a clear signature of the frictionless flow of the fluid of light , i.e. , from a purely optical standpoint , of the suppressed reflection on the plate .",
    "of course , observation of superfluidity in a medium with a lower nonlinear susceptibility @xmath2 would require a larger optical power , but the mechanical force would be correspondingly higher . on the other hand ,",
    "the deformation effect would be strongly suppressed if a nonlinear medium in the solid instead than the liquid state was used : in this case , the mechanical rigidity of the host matrix would in fact add up to the one of the obstacle .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed an experiment that could demonstrate the occurrence of a frictionless flow of superfluid light through and/or around a solid dielectric obstacle . for an obstacle that is not bound to a solid - state matrix , the electromagnetic force induced by the laser light results into the mechanical deformation of the obstacle .",
    "the behavior of this optical analog of the drag force as a function of the light intensity at a given flow speed ( i.e. , at a given angle of incidence ) is strongly nonmonotonic : at low intensities , light is partially scattered by the obstacle and the deformation grows from zero linearly with the intensity ; at high intensities , the deformation completely disappears , indicating a superfluid flow of photons through the obstacle ( in a one - dimensional geometry with a plate - shaped obstacle ) or around it ( in a two - dimensional configuration with a rod - shaped obstacle ) . using realistic parameters ,",
    "we have checked that the actual strength of the deformation falls within the capability of state - of - the - art small - displacement measurements .",
    "an experiment along these lines would provide a crucial contribution to the understanding of the hydrodynamic properties of fluids of light , demonstrating that , also in the optical case , superfluidity is indeed associated to a drop in the drag force exerted by the fluid on obstacles stymying its flow .",
