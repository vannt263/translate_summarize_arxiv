    "due to the larger magnitude of the potentially observable effect , giant hot planets ( @xmath2 ) are particularly good targets for investigating these processes .",
    "one of the most well studied hot jupiters is hd 189733 b @xcite . due to the brightness of its host star ( @xmath3 ) and its large transit depth ( @xmath12.4% ) ,",
    "hd 189733 b has been the target of many detailed observing campaigns over the last decade ( see section 1.2 of * ? ? ? * for a recent overview ) .",
    "one of the most exciting results was the observation of evaporating material by @xcite who measured a 5% transit depth at lyman-@xmath0 and concluded that the absorbing material must be gravitationally unbound .",
    "a followup study showed that the evaporation is highly variable : no absorption was detected in a set of 2010 lyman-@xmath0 observations while a strong lyman-@xmath0 transit , with absorption up to @xmath114% measured in the blue wing of the line profile , was detected in 2011 @xcite .",
    "these results were the first indication of variability in the mass loss of a hot exoplanet .",
    "evaporation of hot planets is driven by atmospheric heating from the absorption of x - ray and extreme uv ( euv ) stellar radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two mechanisms can thus produce variations in the amount of x - ray and euv flux received by a hot planet : 1 .",
    "stellar rotation and the planet s orbital motion , which cause active regions of differing strengths to be directed toward the planet throughout its orbit ; and 2 .",
    "intrinsic time variability in the stellar activity level due to long - term activity cycles or short term variability , such as flares .",
    "these variations provide a natural explanation for changes in the planetary evaporation rate and suggest that hot planets subjected to larger amounts of ionizing stellar radiation will have higher evaporation rates @xcite .",
    "measuring the exosphere of hot planets requires space - based uv observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the extended atmosphere , or the thermosphere at pressures of 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath5 bar , can be observed from the ground using the neutral hydrogen balmer line transitions @xcite .",
    "the first h@xmath0 detection was made by @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled the @xcite detection and showed that the strength of h@xmath0 absorption in the atmosphere of a hot jupiter is dependent on the amount of ionizing stellar radiation , with larger amounts of radiation producing stronger absorption .",
    "thus while h@xmath0 observations most likely do not directly probe the evaporating material , the strength of absorption in the extended atmosphere may provide insight into the strength of the evaporation .",
    "recently , @xcite used archival harps data to measure in - transit h@xmath0 transmission spectra for hd 189733 b across three separate transits .",
    "based on velocity maps of the absorption signatures in both the stellar and planetary rest frames , the authors point out that the absorption signal moves from red - shifted to blue - shifted velocities in the planetary rest frame and shows no velocity gradient across the transit in the stellar rest frame .",
    "they suggest that this is evidence of the absorption signature arising in the frame of the star , i.e. , it is not absorption by planetary material but rather the result of continuum - to - line contrast effects that arise as the planet occults different portions of the stellar disk .",
    "they also highlight the potential problems with using continuum - to - line differential measurements for chromospherically sensitive lines : a non - uniform stellar surface with active regions can be weighted towards a stronger or weaker line core based on which portion of the stellar surface is occulted by the planet , resulting in a contrast effect between the line core and nearby continuum region @xcite .",
    "@xcite conclude that the transit signatures measured in the chromospherically sensitive lines , in particular h@xmath0 and the h and k lines , are the result of the contrast effect and not due to absorption by planetary material .",
    "this is especially relevant to active stars such as hd 189733 ( @xmath6 ; compared to the solar value of @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    "we examine seven archival transits of hd 189733 b , including the same harps data analyzed by @xcite , in order to search for a relationship between the stellar activity level and the strength of the in - transit h@xmath0 signal .",
    "we do not include the results of @xcite since these observations were not performed across a single transit .",
    "we produce detailed transit models in order to investigate the contrast effect and determine if the h@xmath0 signatures measured in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite can be attributed to occultation of a non - uniform stellar surface rather than absorption by planetary material .",
    "we also discuss how planetary rotation can affect the measured absorption velocities , which we calculate for each transit , and present transmission spectrum models of rotation in an extended planetary atmosphere .",
    "the investigation into the absorption line velocities is motivated by the suggestion of @xcite that the h@xmath0 transmission is not due to the planetary atmosphere .",
    "their main argument is that the h@xmath0 line velocities do not follow the pattern expected from absorption in the planetary atmosphere , although we note that they do not present quantitative measurements of the line velocities .",
    "the data sets and reduction processes are described in .",
    "the transmission spectrum is defined in and the average h@xmath0 transmission spectra are given . h@xmath0 and h and",

    "the contrast models are discussed in and the atmospheric rotation models and measured line velocities are given in . provides a brief summary and conclusion of our results .",
    "the observations presented here are a combination of hd 189733 b transits observed with harps @xcite on the 3.6-meter telescope at la silla and hires @xcite on keck i. information about each data set is detailed in , including the average signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of an individual exposure in the continuum near 6571  .",

    "we also retrieved an archival transit obtained using uves @xcite by @xcite to study center - to - limb variations of the d lines .",
    "this transit , however , is fundamentally different when compared to all of the other h@xmath0 transits and does not match any of the features seen in the hires and harps time series .",
    "this abnormal behavior is due to the mid - transit flare identified by @xcite and further investigated by @xcite .",
    "finally , we exclude archival transits from the high dispersion spectrograph on subaru due to the lack of simultaneous observations .",
    "harps has a resolving power of @xmath8 and the hires observations were performed at @xmath9 using the b5 decker and @xmath10 using the b2 decker .",
    "the reduced harps data were taken directly from the eso archive .",
    "we note that we do not perform the scattered light removal process described by @xcite .",
    "we believe that a comparison of our timeseries results and average transmission spectra provide justification : we obtain almost identical results for the behavior of both h@xmath0 and using the standard harps reduction routines .",

    "we used the latest version of molecfit @xcite in order to model telluric absorption in the h@xmath0 order .",

    "we fit for the line depth , small wavelength shifts , and line broadening .",
    "the best - fit scaled , broadened , and shifted telluric model is then divided out of the normalized science spectrum .",
    "this routine works very well for most spectra , removing the telluric absorption down to 5 - 10% of the original line depth .",
    "this typically results in transmission spectrum residuals of @xmath10.1 - 0.5% near the cores of the telluric lines . due to the low signal - to - noise",
    ", we were unable to adequately remove the telluric absorption immediately redward of h@xmath0 for the 2007 august 29 observations ( see ) .",
    "this portion of the spectrum is not included in the absorption calculations .",
    "two - element wavelength binning is applied to all of the individual harps spectra in order to increase the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) .",

    "it seems unlikely that such abrupt changes can be due to physical variations in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "however , transiting gas ( e.g. , previously evaporated material ) not associated with the atmosphere could cause such changes . in this case",
    ", the atmosphere would show no absorption and the external feature ( e.g. , a condensation or accretion stream ; * ? ? ?",

    "we find it more likely that these changes are due variable absorption in the circumplanetary environment since stochastic changes in the stellar activity level , as a result of star - planet interactions , should be observable at orbital phases not associated with the transit .      although emission is a widely examined indicator of chromospheric activity , it is possible that atoms in the extended atmosphere of hd 189733 b might have enough opacity to absorb stellar photons @xcite .",
    "@xcite posited that absorption in stellar prominences fed by planetary mass loss could be responsible for the correlation between planetary surface gravity and log@xmath46 found by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , detections of multiple transitions of neutral calcium have been claimed in the atmosphere of hd 209458 b @xcite .",
    "if there is significant absorption by the planet , the measured in - transit core flux is no longer directly tracing the short - term stellar activity level , especially when comparing in - transit observations to out - of - transit observations .",

    "increasing the number of transits at would help clarify if the observed statistics are representative of a real effect .",

    "for the 2006 september 8 , 2007 july 20 , 2013 july 4 , and 2015 august 4 transits the mean @xmath38 value for the comparison spectra is more negative ( meaning more core flux ) than the mean in - transit @xmath38 value .",
    "we find significant correlations between @xmath18 and @xmath38 for 2013 july 4 and 2015 aug 4 .",
    "the 2013 july 4 correlation is driven by a correlation _ within _ the out - of - transit points ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) ; none of the other dates show correlations within only the in- or out - of - transit points .",
    "however , the 2013 july 4 out - of - transit correlation is itself driven by strong differences between the pre - transit points and the post - transit comparison points ( see ) .",
    "thus we do not see strong evidence of correlated changes between @xmath18 and @xmath38 from one exposure to another .",
    "this tentatively suggests that the lower in - transit @xmath38 differences are not due to changes in the stellar activity level .",
    "an alternative to absorption in the planetary atmosphere producing the lower in - transit @xmath38 values is the transiting of bright active regions @xcite .",
    "if the planet happens to transit an especially active latitudinal band that is bright in compared to the rest of the star , the core emission will be preferentially blocked by the planet s disk , resulting in lower in - transit @xmath38 values .",
    "unless the active latitude is fairly uniform in brightness , the transit tends to be choppy and uneven @xcite .",
    "although the light curves in do show some significant exposure - to - exposure variations , the epochs with lower in - transit versus out - of - transit @xmath38 values ( e.g. , 2007 july 20 and 2013 july 4 ) exhibit fairly smooth time series .",
    "thus we tentatively favor the atmospheric absorption scenario over active region transits , although a thorough investigation of the contrast effect at h and k would be informative .",
    "if in the planetary atmosphere is indeed absorbing , it can not be considered a reliable independent measure of the stellar activity level near ( i.e. , immediately pre- or post - transit ) or during the planet s transit .",
    "detailed theoretical modeling of the population in the extended atmospheres of hot exoplanets would be useful in determining if should be specifically targeted in these systems .",

    "the @xmath18 values for the entire in - transit calculation are shown in the right panel of which explicitly shows the `` absorption '' effect near the stellar limb .",
    "an important takeaway from the example shown in is that the signal induced by clvs at h@xmath0 is well below the measured @xmath18 values for most of the transit presented here .",
    "this is especially true for values of @xmath18 near mid - transit where the clv effect is weakest .",
    "although hd 189733 is an active star and thus it is unlikely that the visible hemisphere is ever pure photosphere , this baseline demonstrates that the observed h@xmath0 transit signals can not be caused by only clvs in this specific case .",
    "however , the magnitude of the clv effect is significant upon ingress and egress and must be included in any model of the in - transit absorption .",
    "it is also important to highlight the velocities of the @xmath21 profiles in the middle panel of : upon ingress , @xmath21 shows red - shifted velocities near maximum absorption while upon egress it shows blue - shifted velocities .",
    "this contrast signal will have an important effect on the @xmath100 models presented in .",
    "specifying unique spectra and a unique spatial configuration for active regions on the stellar disk requires all of the parameters in .",
    "however , some of these parameters are much more important than others in determining changes in the contrast spectra . in addition",
    ", we can look to the observed h@xmath0 transmission spectra and previous hd 189733 studies for guidance on other parameter values .",
    "for example , the spot radii actually govern the distribution of spots since larger spot radii means fewer spots for a constant @xmath66 . but @xmath66 is more important for determining the relative weights between spotted spectra and the photosphere , which in turn is more important for the contrast spectrum . the distribution of active regions is a strong determinant of the time series but does not strongly affect the contrast spectrum if the planet is not occulting a large fraction of the active regions .",
    "another example is @xmath70 of the active region emission . with the assumption of the spectra being produced by the contrast effect",
    ", we can infer that @xmath101 km s@xmath12 .",

    "in this section we present various illustrative examples of the contrast effect for an active stellar surface .",
    "these examples are not meant to be exhaustive but rather representative of how general configurations affect the contrast spectrum and which parameters are most important in producing a significant contrast spectrum .",
    "we do not explore scenarios where the active regions are isolated to a small portion of the stellar disk since transits of these isolated regions have short durations .",
    "instead , we explore scenarios that might produce absorption across the entire transit .",
    "the planet can either transit active regions or the photosphere .",
    "either way , the in - transit spectrum will be altered relative to the out - of - transit spectrum .",

    "@xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "the clvs can still be seen in the contrast profiles ( middle panel ) but since the in - transit spectra are weighted towards active regions , @xmath21 shows emission in the line core at most @xmath106 rather than absorption .",
    "this also shifts the @xmath50 curve up towards less absorption .",
    "one important thing to reiterate in this example is that strong absorption lines are not produced in the contrast spectra .",
    "this occurs for two reasons : 1 .",
    "the facular core emission dominates the contrast spectrum ; 2 .",
    "the spot spectrum actually has a _ smaller core - to - continuum contrast compared with the photospheric spectrum_. this reflects the fact that the h@xmath0 line strength",
    "_ decreases _ for cooler stellar spectra . in this example , @xmath107 k so the spot spectrum is identical to the spot spectrum in .",
    "this has important consequences for the pure - spot scenario , which we do not show : even without the core emission from the facular / plage regions , the contrast spectrum would still show core emission instead of absorption since the spot spectrum shows less core absorption than the photosphere . as a result ,",
    "spots have little effect on the h@xmath0 transmission spectrum .",
    "we also show the filament - only case in for @xmath108 .",
    "filaments do not produce strong contrast spectra for reasonable values of @xmath68 , although we note that the average transmission spectrum ( not shown ) for an entire transit is seen in weak absorption for the case of the photospheric chord transit .",
    "individual transmission spectra are seen in emission for transits of filaments . since their contribution to the contrast effect is minor , even when the planet transits filaments",
    ", we do not focus on them further .",
    "the photospheric transit examples demonstrate that @xmath18 can not be measured in absorption if the planet does not consistently occult facular regions . thus in order to produce the strongest @xmath18 curves shown in hd 189733 b must be transiting a chord that is densely covered with faculae and plage regions . furthermore ,",
    "as we demonstrate below , the emission strength in these facular regions must be similar to what is seen in flaring regions on the sun .",
    "here we present examples of the planet transiting chords that contain active regions .",
    "the first scenario is shown in for uniformly distributed active regions with @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath103 , and @xmath111 .",
    "the @xmath18 timeseries in the right panel is erratic ; there is no trend .",
    "we have chosen the large value of @xmath111 to demonstrate that even very strong core emission can not produce strong contrast spectra ( center panel ) if the planet never occults significant areas of active regions .    and show examples of the planet transiting an active latitude .",
    "the active region configuration is identical in both cases .",
    "the only difference is in the value of @xmath69 : in @xmath112 , while in @xmath105 .",
    "the mid - transit times where the planet occults the largest area of facular regions show significant differences in the strength of the transmission spectrum : for the larger @xmath69 the absorption line is @xmath12@xmath75 stronger .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath18 values consistently show absorption across the entire transit whereas in the @xmath112 case @xmath18 approaches zero near mid - transit .",
    "these examples illustrate the important point that _ the strength of @xmath69 is the dominant factor in determining the magnitude of the contrast effect for any given transit snapshot .",
    "_ for the @xmath18 timeseries , @xmath67 , and therefore the facular coverage fraction , is also important .",
    "but @xmath69 is the main determinant of the depth of the contrast spectrum . in neither case",
    "does the contrast effect produce absorption similar to what is observed .",
    "the previous two examples demonstrate the need for greater contrast at h@xmath0 in order to reproduce the observations . and show scenarios with very high surface coverage fractions ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 in both cases ) and very strong facular / plage emission ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the only difference is that the active region distribution in is centered at @xmath115 while in it is centered at @xmath116 . in the planet",
    "transits an almost constant area of active regions and the strength of the facular emission produces strong contrast absorption lines ( center panel ) and a relatively uniform @xmath18 timeseries ( right panel ) .",
    "although @xmath69 is the same in the contrast profiles are weaker and @xmath18 is @xmath117 shallower .",
    "this is the result of the planet transiting the edge of the active region distribution where , at any in - transit snapshot , the planet occults a relatively smaller area of facular / plage regions compared to the distribution in .",
    "_ this suggests that the active regions on hd 189733 s surface must be centered very near the planet s transit chord in order to produce a relatively uniform @xmath18 timeseries .",
    "_                the value of @xmath67 in the above examples , which equates to a 20% surface coverage of facular / plage regions , does not necessarily need to be so low , i.e. , the active region surface coverage does not need to be so large .",
    "shows the case for @xmath76 , @xmath118 , @xmath103 , and @xmath111 .",
    "while @xmath18 is not as uniform , the values during the first half of the transit approach the largest observed values from .",
    "we note that moving the center of the active region distribution to @xmath119 latitude results in essentially no contrast for the entire transit .",
    "this again illustrates the need for the active regions to be concentrated near the transit chord and to be uniformly distributed in longitude .",
    "it also shows that if @xmath67 increases , @xmath69 must remain high or even increase in order to get close to the observed values ; decreasing @xmath69 from 4.0 to @xmath12.0 produces a very weak contrast effect .",
    "we demonstrated above that it is possible under some conditions to reproduce even the strongest observed @xmath18 in - transit signals using the contrast effect .",
    "however , the only parameter configurations that are able to produce these @xmath18 values involve modest to large facular coverage fractions and @xmath120 . although we do not know exactly how the active regions are distributed on hd 189733 or the strength of the facular / plage h@xmath0 core emission , we can attempt to roughly constrain the _ combination _ of these parameters by comparing hd 189733 with less active main sequence templates of similar @xmath85 .",
    "we have downloaded archived keck hires data for the three template stars listed in .",
    "hd 189733 is also listed for comparison .",
    "we use these templates to find parameter combinations of @xmath69 and @xmath121 , where @xmath121 is the fractional surface area covered by facular regions , that can fill in the h@xmath0 absorption of the less - active template and match the line profile of hd 189733 .",
    "note that @xmath121 is just another way of specifying @xmath67 in the contrast models , where @xmath54 .",
    "the hd 189733 spectrum is an average of the comparison spectra used in all of the keck transits ( purple circles in ) .",
    "the facular spectrum @xmath122 is constructed in the same manner as the contrast model facular spectrum except now @xmath69 refers to the core flux of the template spectrum .",
    "the final spectrum is the weighted average of the photospheric spectrum @xmath123 , which is the observed template spectrum , and @xmath122 :    @xmath124    lcccc hd 189733 & 5040 & 0.81 & 0.76 & 0.51 + hd 192263 & 4975 & 0.83 & 0.75 & 0.47 + hd 104067 & 4956 & 0.91 & 0.75 & 0.34 + hd 87883 & 4958 & 0.78 & 0.77 & 0.28 +    while all of the observed template spectra are rotationally broadened according to the @xmath24sin@xmath60 value of hd 189733 , we do not account for the clvs discussed previously .",
    "thus we are only exploring first - order approximations for which @xmath69 and @xmath121 values are needed to reproduce the hd 189733 h@xmath0 core . since we do not have spatially resolved spectra of these stars we can not build up the spectrum across the stellar disk as is done in the contrast model case .",
    "three different parameter combinations are shown for each template in .",
    "a @xmath13 minimization routine is used to produce the fits for various initial parameter combinations that correspond roughly to parameter space explored in each column .",
    "the first column shows a direct comparison between hd 189733 ( dark gray line ) and the templates ( orange lines ) .",
    "column 2 shows the case of high @xmath121 and low @xmath69 , i.e. , weak facular emission but distributed across much of the stellar disk .",
    "column 3 shows slightly stronger @xmath69 but reduced @xmath121 .",
    "finally , column 4 shows large @xmath69 and small @xmath121 .",
    "we note that the hd 189733 spectrum is also plotted in columns 2 - 4 but is obscured by the model fits .    for all three templates",
    ", a crucial trend is seen : as @xmath69 increases , @xmath121 must decrease for a given photospheric spectrum .",
    "this is not surprising but has important consequences for which parameter combinations in the contrast model are likely to be representative of hd 189733 s active surface .",
    "for example , the very low @xmath67 and very high @xmath69 case shown in is unlikely to accurately represent the stellar surface since the same parameter combination would drastically overestimate the line core emission in .",

    "one important caveat to the template comparison is that the template spectra themselves contain some contribution from active regions .",
    "thus we are not comparing pure photospheres to hd 189733 s active surface .",
    "however , this does not affect the relationship between @xmath69 and @xmath121 ; one must decrease as the other increases for a specific template spectrum , pure photosphere or not . on the other hand",
    ", the _ value _ of the parameters in may be affected .",
    "for example , instead of @xmath125 and @xmath126 in the lower right panel of , one or both values would need to be larger if hd 87883 s spectrum contained no contributions from active regions .",
    "thus the parameter combinations shown in are likely lower limits to the true values .",
    "we have presented transit models for a planet with no atmosphere in order to explore the contrast effect in h@xmath0 that is produced when in - transit spectra , for which a portion of the stellar disk is occulted , are compared with out - of - transit spectra .",
    "we find the following :    * spots and filaments , for the physically reasonable surface coverage fractions and spot / filament parameters explored here , are unimportant in the h@xmath0 contrast spectrum .",
    "the main contribution to the contrast effect comes from strong facular or plage emission .",
    "* transits of the photosphere do not produce h@xmath0 contrast in absorption ; active regions that include strong faculae / plage emission must be transited to produce @xmath21 in absorption .",
    "* the facular coverage fraction must be @xmath127% and these facular regions must be concentrated around the transit chord in order for the strongest observed h@xmath0 transits to be reproduced .",
    "large coverage fractions , no matter the value of @xmath69 , can not reproduce the observed h@xmath0 line profiles if the distribution is uniform across the stellar disk .",
    "this holds true even for very large coverage fractions of @xmath128% since the contrast spectrum then begins to be weighted back towards the active region spectra , producing emission instead of absorption . *",
    "certain configurations of facular regions combined with values of @xmath129 are able to produce relatively uniform transits with depths of @xmath130 , similar to the observed transits shown in . *",
    "the comparison of less active template stars to hd 189733 suggests that for @xmath131 the facular coverage fraction must be @xmath127% .",
    "this is similar to what is needed to reproduce the observed transits , although these are lower limits since the templates do not represent pure stellar photospheres .",
    "while our simulations show that the contrast effect is able to reproduce the observed in - transit @xmath18 values , it is unclear if the necessary parameters are physically realistic .",
    "we believe facular coverage fractions of @xmath110% , and possibly higher , are not unreasonable considering the stronger activity level of hd 189733 compared with the sun .",
    "solar facular coverage can reach @xmath15% during solar active periods @xcite and plage coverage can reach @xmath18% @xcite . on the other hand , @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "similar spot coverages are found by @xcite for the same data set .",
    "this would suggest values of @xmath133 for the contrast model in order to produce @xmath18% facular / plage coverage .",
    "the larger question for h@xmath0 contrast models is what constitutes a reasonable value of @xmath69 .",
    "we have shown that @xmath134 is needed in order to produce values of @xmath18 similar to what is observed .",
    "if this is the case , then the normal or quiescent facular / plage regions on hd 189733 have h@xmath0 emission line strengths similar to moderate flaring regions on the sun .",
    "magnetic fields play an important role in heating the chromosphere and producing bright regions in the atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , simulations of h@xmath0 brightness in solar active regions show that the brightest regions correspond to the strongest local magnetic field strengths @xcite .",
    "hd 189733 has a much stronger global magnetic field than the sun , with radial field values reaching 30 - 40 g across much of the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "thus the larger field values , and consequently heating rates , could have a significant effect on the emission strength of h@xmath0 in active regions .",
    "a final consideration is the requirement that the facular / plage regions be concentrated very close to the planetary transit chord , or a latitude very near @xmath135 .",
    "active latitudes are known features of the solar surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and have been inferred via photometric transits for other stars as well @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that spots near @xmath136 are able to best reproduce the measured rv variations .",
    "thus it is not unreasonable that the facular / plage regions are located near the transit chord .",
    "the specificity required , however , to reproduce any of the observed @xmath18 transits is concerning , especially if active latitudes migrate as a function of time .",
    "although we can not conclusively distinguish between models in which the observed @xmath18 transits are due to absorption by the planet or from the contrast effect , we believe the parameter values required to reproduce the observations are rather specific and likely do not represent the average stellar disk of hd 189733 .",
    "furthermore , the contrast effect can not explain the @xmath18 values seen in absorption immediately before the 2013 july 4 transit , before and after the 2015 august 4 transit , and immediately after the 2006 august 21 transit , i.e. , these extended transits are suggestive of absorbing circumplanetary material . in addition , we demonstrated in @xcite that these pre- and post - transit signatures are abnormal and must be related to the planetary transit , further making the case for a circumplanetary origin .",
    "more detailed modeling of h@xmath0 spectral line profiles in faculae and plages for active stars are needed to determine if the large core strengths used here are realistic . for now , however , we favor the planetary interpretation .",

    "as we show below , the individual harps transmission spectra are fairly noisy and result in highly uncertain values of @xmath100 .",
    "the keck velocities are more tightly constrained due to the much higher signal - to - noise of the h@xmath0 spectra .",
    "we perform all of our velocity analysis in the stellar rest frame . after correcting the observed spectra for the system radial velocity and the earth s heliocentric motion ,",
    "this is also the frame of the observer .",
    "shifting the transmission spectra by the planetary radial velocity can confuse and mask atmospheric velocities that may be contributing to the line profile , as we demonstrate below .",
    "the line velocity index from @xcite is defined as :    @xmath138    where @xmath23 is the transmission spectrum flux at velocity @xmath24 .",
    "the index is essentially the velocity vector @xmath24 weighted by the square of the transmission spectrum flux .",

    "the uncertainty on the individual @xmath100 points is calculated by taking the standard deviation of the mean of velocities corresponding to the @xmath140 values that comprise 68% of the total weight .",

    "we use the same stellar and planetary parameters that were presented in and the same phoenix model spectra are used as the intrinsic stellar spectra .",

    "assuming a hydrostatic versus uniform density atmosphere has little effect on the simulations .",
    "the planetary h@xmath0 absorption profile is approximated as a velocity - broadened delta function where the broadening parameter is labeled @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the planet is assumed to rotate rigidly throughout the atmosphere .",
    "we have also investigated the effects of superrotating equatorial jets @xcite and find that they produce similar effects as rigid rotation , although the jet velocities required to produce the same line profiles are larger than the rotational velocities since the jets occupy a smaller portion of the atmosphere .",
    "we do not include jets explicitly in the rest of the model discussion but we will discuss them as part of the general effect of large rotational velocities .            shows the effect of a rotating atmosphere on the transmission spectrum for a prograde planetary orbit . upon ingress",
    "( left panel ) the portion of the planet s atmosphere dominating the transmission spectrum is moving _ away _ from the observer while the planet s bulk motion is _ towards _ the observer .",
    "the net effect is to produce a measured centroid velocity , or in our case @xmath100 , that is significantly less than the bulk planetary velocity .",
    "this was first demonstrated by @xcite ( their figure 8) and reiterated in @xcite ( their figure 2 ) . the same effect is seen upon egress ( right panel ) .",

    "while these transit curves can not explain the erratic velocities of the harps data or the 2006 august 21 keck data , they may provide evidence for what we are seeing in the 2013 july 4 and 2015 august 4 keck transits and perhaps the first half of the 2013 june 3 transit",
    ".        shows three different rotation models plotted against the 2015 august 4 @xmath100 values .",
    "rotational velocities @xmath144 km s@xmath12 do not match the data well ; velocities between 10 - 12 km s@xmath12 are required to produce the small @xmath100 values between first and second and third and fourth contact .",
    "values of @xmath145 km s@xmath12 begin to produce @xmath100 values that are too small , i.e. , of the wrong sign .",
    "the models do not do a good job of reproducing @xmath100 near @xmath146 and @xmath147 minutes ; all of the models produce @xmath100 larger than the measured values .",
    "overall , however , these models demonstrate that large velocities in the extended atmosphere can produce the small observed velocities .",
    "it is possible for certain contrast model scenarios to produce @xmath100 values similar to what is observed for the 2013 july 4 and 2015 august 4 transits .",
    "we have calculated @xmath100 for the contrast model line profiles .",
    "the @xmath100 values for the contrast models from ( left panel ) , ( middle panel ) , and ( right panel ) are shown in .",
    "the contrast model line profiles show trends similar to the 2015 august 4 data , although only the very active case ( middle panel ) shows the blue - shifted to red - shifted pattern from the first half of the transit to the second half . although not shown here , all of the other cases explored in show something similar to the left panel of : large red - shifted velocities during the first half of the transit and blue - shifted velocities during the second half .",
    "more active cases than the middle panel tend to move the other direction : larger and larger blue - shifted velocities and then red - shifted velocities during the second half .",
    "overall , the velocities from the contrast models do not reproduce the observed 2015 august 4 velocities except for the case of a very active stellar surface with the active regions centered very near the planet s transit chord ( see ) .",
    "for this reason , and those given concerning the planetary rotation models , we do not believe the contrast velocities represent a convincing explanation for the observations .",
    "however , further in - transit observations should be conducted to strengthen or reject this argument .",
    "the rotation models presented here are meant to demonstrate that the low velocities , i.e. , much less than the in - transit planetary line - of - sight velocity , observed in the h@xmath0 transits are not necessarily intrinsic to the star because of their magnitude . while very hot jupiters such as hd 189733 b are generally assumed to be synchronously rotating , there are no measurements of hot jupiter rotation rates outside of the studies done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite found evidence for a synchronously rotating hd 189733 b. however , these measurements were made in coo . ]",
    "@xcite and @xcite . the co measurements probe much higher pressures deeper in the atmosphere than h@xmath0 and , which probe pressures of 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath5 bar @xcite .",
    "the measurements by @xcite do not examine the velocities of individual observations and instead fit the average in - transit line profile .",
    "@xcite also do not include differential limb darkening , opting to use a broadband limb darkening law .",
    "this could significantly affect the velocities of the model line profile @xcite and should be investigated .",
    "even if a hot jupiter is synchronously rotating , velocities larger than the equatorial rotational velocity may be present in the extended atmosphere .",
    "@xcite find wind speeds of @xmath17 - 11 km s@xmath12 in the upper atmospheres of both a synchronously and a quickly rotating hd 189733 b. their models were calculated at pressures of 10@xmath148 - 10@xmath4 bar , which begins to probe the potential h@xmath0 formation region .",
    "thus it is not implausible that even stronger winds may form at higher altitudes or that unexplored atmospheric dynamics are contributing to the h@xmath0 transmission spectra .",
    "while the most active contrast model is able to produce @xmath100 values similar to what is observed for the 2015 august 4 transit , we do not believe this is the correct model due to required specificity of the model parameters .",
    "in other words , matching the velocities requires all of the most active contrast model parameters to be accurate whereas matching only the @xmath18 observations provides more leeway in the active region coverage fraction and facular emission line strength . on the other hand",
    ", the 2015 august 4 transit does seem to be unique in that it shows the largest @xmath18 signal and the strongest out - of - transit emission .",
    "although it seems unlikely , we can not definitively rule out the most active case as an explanation for the both @xmath18 and @xmath100 .",
    "we emphasize that the h@xmath0 transits do not show a consistent velocity signal across epochs and as a result no firm conclusions can be reached concerning their origin .",
    "the individual harps spectra are especially noisy and the velocity uncertainties derived here are large making them even less useful for understanding the in - transit signal .",
    "further short - cadence h@xmath0 transit observations are needed to work towards clarifying the velocity signal and , by extension , the in - transit h@xmath0 absorption line profiles .",
    "we have presented an analysis of h@xmath0 transmission spectra for 7 transits of hd 189733 b that span almost a decade .",
    "five of these h@xmath0 transits are from archival harps and keck data , while two were previously analyzed by our group in @xcite .",
    "four of these transits show significant and consistent h@xmath0 spectra in absorption throughout the transit while three others show strong variations that may be due to changes in stellar activity .",
    "the irregular changes may also be due to transiting gas not bound to the planet .",
    "our main conclusions are the following :    * we do not find evidence of a clear relationship between the stellar activity level and the strength of the in - transit h@xmath0 signal .",
    "the outlier in this case is the data from 2015 august 4 which shows both the strongest h@xmath0 absorption and the highest stellar activity level .",
    "if the absorption signal arises in the planetary atmosphere , this reveals a potential stellar activity threshold below which the ionizing flux from the star is not high enough to create large h@xmath0 transit depths .",
    "this should be investigated further with future transits and simultaneous uv measurements of the stellar activity level . * we explored detailed simulations of the h@xmath0 contrast effect for hd 189733",
    "b. we find that large facular / plage coverage fractions of @xmath127% and very strong facular / plage core emission strengths of @xmath149 are required to reproduce the observed h@xmath0 observations .",
    "furthermore , these facular / plage regions must be concentrated very close to the transit chord of the planet .",
    "spots and filaments do not have a significant effect on the h@xmath0 contrast spectrum .",
    "* due to the specificity of the contrast parameters required to reproduce the measured @xmath18 values , combined with the natural explanation of absorption in the thermosphere @xcite , we favor a planetary atmospheric origin for the h@xmath0 transmission spectra .",
    "a similar argument can be made for interpreting the @xmath100 measurements . however , detailed models of active regions on active stars such as hd 189733 are needed to understand if the necessary contrast parameters are reasonable .",
    "* we have also explored the velocity centroids of the measured h@xmath0 transmission spectra using models of planetary rotation .",
    "we find that planetary rotational velocities of @xmath19 - 12 km s@xmath12 are able to produce in - transit @xmath100 values similar to those from the 2015 august 4 transit .",
    "these large velocities are representative of dynamics in the very extended atmosphere and do not necessarily suggest that the planet is rotating faster than the synchronous rate .",
    "these models demonstrate that large atmospheric velocities can produce the small observed @xmath100 values and that they do not need to originate on the stellar surface .",
    "however , there is no consistent velocity pattern across epochs so the results of the rotation models can not be broadly applied .",
    "further short - cadence transits at very high s / n are needed to test these ideas .",
    "future and current planet hunting missions , such as the _ transiting exoplanet survey satellite _ ( _ tess _ ) and the ground - based kilodegree extremely little telescope ( kelt * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the multi - site all - sky camera ( mascara * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have and will detect many hot planets transiting relatively bright stars .",
    "this will significantly increase the number of objects for which short - cadence , high - resolution optical transmission spectroscopy can be performed with 4-meter or 10-meter class telescopes .",
    "in addition , thirty - meter class telescopes will be able to perform similar observations on much fainter systems .",
    "stars with high activity levels should be targeted as comparison cases with hd 189733 b. indeed , active stars may be the only systems with hot planets exhibiting h@xmath0 absorption in their extended atmospheres @xcite .",

    "while the h@xmath0 observations do not probe the escaping exosphere , this ground - based approach may become the best option for measuring the base of evaporative flows due to the impending loss of _ hst _ and its spectroscopic uv capabilities .",

    "<S> however , there is no clear trend between the core emission and the strength of the in - transit h@xmath0 signal , although the transit showing the largest absorption value also occurs when the star is the most active . </S>",
    "<S> we present simulations of the in - transit contrast effect and find that the planet must consistently transit active latitudes with very strong facular and plage emission regions in order to reproduce the observed line strengths . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the measured velocity centroids with models of planetary rotation and show that the small line profile velocities could be due to large velocities in the upper atmosphere of the planet . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we find it more likely that the measured h@xmath0 signals arise in the extended planetary atmosphere , although a better understanding of active region emission for active stars such as hd 189733 are needed . </S>"
