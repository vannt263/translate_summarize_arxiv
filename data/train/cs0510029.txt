    "ahlswede , gcs , krner , witsenhausen and wyner  @xcite studied the problem of extraction of `` common information '' from a pair of random variables .",
    "the simplest form of this problem is the following : fix some distribution for a pair of random variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 . consider @xmath2 independent pairs @xmath3 ; each has the same distribution as @xmath4 .",
    "we want to extract `` common information '' from the sequences @xmath5 and @xmath6 , _ i.e. _ , to find a random variable @xmath7 such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 are small .",
    "we say that `` extraction of common information is impossible '' if the entropy of any such variable @xmath7 is small .",
    "let us show that this is the case if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are independent . in this case @xmath10 and @xmath11 are independent . recall the well - known inequality @xmath12 here @xmath13 ( because @xmath14 and @xmath15 are independent ) ; two other summands on the right hand side are small by our assumption .",
    "it turns out that a similar statement holds for dependent random variables .",
    "however , there is one exception .",
    "if the joint probability matrix of @xmath4 can be divided into blocks , there is a random variable @xmath16 that is a function of @xmath0 and a function of @xmath1 ( `` block number '' ) . then @xmath17 is common information of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it was shown by ahlswede , gcs and krner  @xcite that this is the only case when there exists common information .",
    "their original proof is quite technical .",
    "several years ago another approach was proposed by romashchenko  @xcite using `` conditionally independent '' random variables .",
    "romashchenko introduced the notion of conditionally independent random variables and showed that extraction of common information from conditionally independent random variables is impossible .",
    "we prove that if the joint probability matrix of a pair of random variables @xmath18 is not a block matrix , then @xmath0 and @xmath1 are conditionally independent .",
    "we also show several new information inequalities for conditionally independent random variables .",
    "consider four random variables @xmath19 .",
    "suppose that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are independent , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are independent given @xmath20 , and also independent given @xmath21 , _",

    "a similar argument shows that the order of conditional independence should be large if the matrix is close to a block matrix .",
    "for brevity , we call joint probability matrices of conditionally independent random variables _ good matrices_.    the proof of theorem 2 consists of three main steps . first , we prove , that the set of good matrices is dense in the set of all joint probability matrices .",
