    "the survivability of the divertor during prolonged repetitive exposures to harsh edge plasma conditions as well as its longevity deep into the nuclear phase are essential for the success of the iter project and impose stringent requirements on material selection@xcite . after the decision that iter will begin operations with a full tungsten divertor@xcite , r&d activities worldwide have focused on assessing various sources of mechanical and structural degradation of tungsten plasma - facing components in the hostile fusion reactor environment@xcite ; neutron irradiation effects on the mechanical properties , helium irradiation and hydrogen retention effects on the microstructure , thermal shock resistance and thermal fatigue resistance .",
    "the dependence of key mechanical properties ( ductile to brittle transition temperature , yield strength , ultimate tensile strength , fracture toughness ) on the fabrication history , the alloying or impurity elements , the metallurgical process and the grain structure is indicative of the complex nature of such investigations@xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the iter materials properties handbook puts strong emphasis to documenting the mechanical properties of tungsten@xcite .",
    "another phenomenon that is crucial for the lifetime of the tungsten divertor is melt layer motion during off - normal or transient events , namely unmitigated edge localized modes , vertical displacement events and major disruptions@xcite .",
    "melt layer motion leads to strong modifications of the local surface topology and thus to degradation of power - handling capabilities but can also lead to plasma contamination by high - z droplets in the case of splashing@xcite .",
    "the numerical modelling of melt motion is based on coupling the navier - stokes equations for the liquid metal with the heat conduction equation as well as the current continuity equation and supplementing the system with appropriate boundary conditions dictated by the incident plasma@xcite .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence of the viscosity , surface tension and other thermophysical properties of liquid tungsten constitute a necessary input .",
    "moreover , since re - solidification determines the onset but also the arrest of macroscopic motion , the thermophysical properties of solid tungsten at elevated temperatures and their behavior at the solid - liquid phase transition are also necessary input .",
    "unfortunately , the iter materials properties handbook does not provide any information on the thermophysical properties of liquid tungsten and its recommended description of some thermophysical properties of solid tungsten at elevated temperatures is not based on state - of - the - art experimental data@xcite .",
    "it should also be mentioned that these properties are also essential input for the modelling of tungsten dust transport@xcite ( since tungsten dust should promptly melt in iter - like edge plasmas and thermionic emission at the liquid phase plays a dominant role in its energy budget ) and for the modelling of the interaction of transient plasmas with adhered tungsten dust@xcite ( since wetting is determined by the competition between the spreading and re - solidification rates ) .",
    "this manuscript is focused on reviewing state - of - the - art measurements of several thermophysical properties of pure tungsten for temperatures varying from the room temperature up to the boiling point .",
    "the thermophysical properties of interest are the latent heat of fusion , the electrical resistivity , the specific isobaric heat capacity , the thermal conductivity and the mass density ( for the solid and liquid phase ) as well as the surface tension and the dynamic viscosity ( for the liquid phase ) .",
    "the aim of the present investigation is to identify and critically evaluate reliable experimental datasets in order to propose accurate analytical expressions for the temperature dependence of these thermophysical properties that will standardize their description in the multiple heating , melt layer motion and dust transport codes developed by the fusion community .",
    "it has been possible to provide accurate analytical expressions for most properties based solely on experimental data and without the need for any extrapolations .",
    "the only exceptions are the surface tension and viscosity of liquid tungsten , where wide extrapolations had to be carried out beyond the melting point , since the only experimental sources on the temperature dependence referred to under - cooled liquid tungsten .",
    "these extrapolations are based on established empirical expressions that are known to be accurate for non - refractory liquid metals and were cross - checked with constraints imposed by rigorous statistical mechanics relations .",
    "taking into account that temperature gradients of the surface tension can be responsible for thermo - capillary flows and that viscosity is responsible for the damping of melt motion , it is important that such measurements are carried out in the unexplored temperature range , for instance with levitating drop methods on ground - based laboratories@xcite or preferably in microgravity@xcite .",
    "the difference between the specific enthalpy of the liquid state and the solid state at the melting phase transition yields the latent heat of fusion . in table",
    "[ tableheatoffusion ] , the values of the w latent molar heat of fusion are provided as measured by dedicated experiments@xcite or as recommended by theoretical investigations@xcite and material handbooks@xcite .",
    "we point out that the measurement uncertainties in the determination of the heat of fusion with the resistive pulse heating ( or dynamic pulse calorimetry ) technique can be expected to be around @xmath0@xcite .",
    "overall , given these uncertainties , the experimental data are well clustered around @xmath1kj / mol .",
    "the value that is nearly exclusively cited in material handbooks and modelling works is @xmath2kj / mol .",
    "some older literature sources recommend a very small value @xmath3kj / mol , see for instance refs.@xcite , which does not seem to be supported by any measurements .",
    "most probably , this value stems from a semi - empirical relation known as richard s rule@xcite ; by equating the liquid state with the solid state specific gibbs free energy @xmath4 at the melting point , we acquire @xmath5 .",
    "richard s rule is based on positional disorder arguments and empirical observations , it states that the entropy of fusion is a quasi - universal constant for all metals with an approximate value @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the ideal gas constant whose arithmetic value is @xmath8j/(mol@xmath9k ) .",
    "this rule allows the calculation of @xmath10 with knowledge of the melting temperature @xmath11 only . for tungsten",
    ", we have @xmath12k , which translates to @xmath13kj / mol . modified versions of richard s rule take into account the average value of the entropy of fusion for bcc and fcc metals , which is @xmath14@xcite and leads to the inaccurate prediction @xmath15kj / mol . in fact ,",

    "non - contact techniques such as the electrostatic levitation method are preferred due to the high melting temperatures and the enhanced reactivity at elevated temperatures@xcite . in general , it is assumed that the dependence of the dynamic viscosity of pure liquid metals on the temperature is of the arrhenius form@xcite , _ i.e. _ @xmath16}$ ] with @xmath17 the activation energy for viscous flow , @xmath18 the pre - exponential viscosity and @xmath8j/(mol@xmath9k ) the ideal gas constant .",

    "the fundamental assumptions behind the fowler formula and the born - green formula determine the applicability range of this simple elegant formula@xcite , which has proved to be very accurate for elemental liquid metals@xcite .",
    "* liquid tungsten . * numerous works that have reviewed experimental data for the viscosity of liquid metals , elemental but also alloys , can be encountered in the literature@xcite .",
    "similar to the case of surface tension , in these compilations , very few data can be found for the viscosity of tungsten at the melting point and nearly no measurements for its temperature dependence .",
    "the only exception are very recent experiments that were carried out by ishikawa _",
    "et al . _ with the electrostatic levitation method@xcite .",
    "the measurements reported in ref.@xcite will be considered in greater detail , since it has been concluded that the measurements of ref.@xcite were affected by sample positioning forces . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the viscosity was measured for liquid tungsten in the under - cooled phase , @xmath26 .",
    "the temperature interval of @xmath27k can be considered as adequate for the determination of the temperature dependence .",
    "an arrhenius fit of the form @xmath28}$ ] provided an accurate description of the data , which - in absence of other measurements - needs to be extrapolated in the entire liquid phase .",
    "ishikawa fit _ reads as@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is measured in pas .",
    "this expression corresponds to an activation energy @xmath31j / mol which has been determined by least square fitting with a @xmath32 uncertainty .",
    "the extrapolated value of the viscosity at the melting point is @xmath33pas close to the experimental value @xmath34pas provided in the literature@xcite",
    ". both measurements of ishikawa et al.@xcite are illustrated in figure [ figurewdynamicviscosity]a together with the least square fitted arrhenius expressions . in the absence of other experimental results ,",
    "the fowler - born - green formula provides the only way to cross - check the adopted measurements . in figure [ figurewdynamicviscosity]b ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 follows the paradis fit and @xmath37 follows the ishikawa fit , is expressed in units of @xmath38 and plotted as a function of the temperature .",
    "the quantity does not diverge strongly from unity , especially taking into account the experimental uncertainties and the wide extrapolations in the viscosity as well as the surface tension .",
    "it is worth investigating whether fitting expressions other than the pure arrhenius form can equally fit the experimental data , but provide a better agreement with the fowler - born - green formula .",
    "a cubic arrhenius fit , @xmath39}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is measured in pas , fulfills these two criteria .",
    "it is impossible to determine whether the extrapolated arrhenius fit for the viscosity or the extrapolated linear fit for the surface tension are responsible for the deviations from the fowler - born - green formula , not to mention that this formula should not be exactly obeyed across the liquid phase .",
    "therefore , we still recommend the use of the pure arrhenius fit .",
    "the aim of this comparison was to highlight the need for tungsten surface tension and viscosity measurements in larger temperature ranges and for temperatures exceeding the melting point .",
    "the recommended analytical expressions are nearly exclusively based on experimental results for pure polycrystalline tungsten .",
    "nevertheless , unless rather extreme cases are considered , microstructural details and impurity concentrations should have a negligible influence on the thermophysical properties of interest . even in the case of pure surface quantities that are very sensitive to adsorbates , such as the surface tension in the liquid phase ,",
    "the volatility of low - z contaminants at elevated temperatures guarantees a limited effect . considering the hostile edge plasma environment of magnetic fusion reactors , it is inevitable that complications arise which should be discussed in further detail .",
    "these mainly concern the possible impact of external magnetic fields , plasma contamination and beryllium - tungsten alloying .",
    "as we shall see , the related phenomena are either insignificant or restricted in effect .",
    "\\(i ) _ magnetic field effects .",
    "_ the prominent role of the de - localized valence electrons in charge and heat transport implies that strong external magnetic fields could influence the magnitude and alter the isotropic nature of thermophysical properties such as the thermal conductivity or the electrical resistivity .",
    "however , even for high field strengths , magnetic field effects can be expected to be very weak for tungsten , since the mean free paths are much smaller than the larmor radii due to the enormous density of the scattering centers .",
    "order of magnitude estimates can be performed with the aid of the elementary drude model , _",
    "i.e. _ a single particle description with friction described by the relaxation time approximation@xcite .",
    "the valence electron density is @xmath40m@xmath41 and the mean time between collisions is given by @xmath42 , which lead to @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the cyclotron frequency of the valence electrons . for @xmath45 t and room temperature",
    ", we have @xmath46 . within the drude model",
    ", the relative electrical resistivity increase is @xmath47@xcite which is clearly negligible .",
    "\\(ii ) _ plasma contaminants . _",
    "as analyzed in the previous section , for high impurity or imperfection concentrations , interaction with defects may dominate the valence electron transport and thus drastically modify quantities such as the thermal conductivity or the electrical resistivity .",
    "high hydrogen and helium atom concentrations are unavoidable in the surface proximity of plasma - facing components , owing to the implantation and trapping of the incident plasma ions .",
    "it has been documented in the literature that helium bubble and tungsten fuzz formation lead to the degradation of the local thermal properties@xcite , as expected from the porous or fiber - like surface morphology .",
    "in particular , recent thermal conductivity measurements for tungsten damaged by high flux - low energy helium plasma revealed a @xmath48 reduction@xcite .",
    "such phenomena may have an impact on the pfc power - handling capabilities and more systematic measurements need to be carried out in order to document the extent of the thermally degraded near - surface region .",
    "however , they are most likely not relevant for repetitive transient melting events . at elevated temperatures ( still well below the melting temperature ) , trapped gas desorption accompanied by nano - structure annealing@xcite can be expected to strongly limit the effect of plasma contamination from the beginning of the elm cycle .",
    "\\(iii ) _ be - w alloying effects .",
    "_ beryllium erosion from the first wall and its transport to the divertor has been well - understood and documented in jet@xcite .",
    "moreover , the iter divertor surface is expected to be covered by a thin beryllium layer@xcite . under the appropriate plasma conditions ( so that significant concentrations of beryllium remain locally deposited ) and surface temperatures ( so that element inter - diffusion is significant ) beryllium - tungsten alloys can form , for instance be@xmath49w with @xmath50k or be@xmath51w with @xmath52k@xcite . as exhibited by the much lower melting points ,",
    "mixed beryllium - tungsten materials are characterized by thermophysical properties that strongly depend on the alloy stoichiometry .",
    "optimized conditions for the growth of be - w alloys might occur near the strike point@xcite .",
    "further r&d is necessary to quantify the local extent of be - w alloy formation .",
    "it is evident though that , unless the thickness of the alloy layer is significant , its presence should not be important for thermal or hydrodynamic modelling in spite of the totally different thermophysical properties compared to tungsten .      as a consequence of its extensive use in high temperature technological applications as well as due to its high melting point and very extended liquid range ,",
    "tungsten can be considered as a standard reference material in the metrology of thermophysical quantities .",
    "the development of dynamic pulse calorimetry ( starting from the 70s ) has allowed for accurate measurements of the latent heat of fusion , electrical resistivity , specific isobaric heat capacity , thermal conductivity and mass density across the solid and liquid state .",
    "the development of levitation calorimetry ( starting from the 80s ) has allowed for accurate measurements of the surface tension and the dynamic viscosity at the beginning of the liquid state .",
    "hence , it has been possible to provide accurate analytical expressions for the temperature dependence of most properties of interest based solely on experimental data and without the need for any extrapolations .",
    "the only exceptions are the surface tension and dynamic viscosity of liquid tungsten , where wide extrapolations had to be carried out beyond the melting point , since the only experimental sources on the temperature dependence referred to under - cooled liquid tungsten specimen . in spite of these limitations , the extrapolated analytical expressions performed very well against constraints imposed by rigorous statistical mechanics relations .",
    "further measurements of the surface tension and viscosity in the unexplored temperature range are certainly desirable , but the proposed expressions are expected to be fairly accurate .",
    "the thermophysical properties analyzed in this work constitute input for simulations of the thermal and hydrodynamic response of tungsten plasma - facing components , dust and droplets to incident plasma particle and heat fluxes . for this reason , in this concluding paragraph , it was judged to be more practical and convenient for the specialized reader that we simply gather the recommended analytical expressions for the temperature dependence of the thermophysical properties of pure solid and liquid tungsten . before proceeding , it is worth mentioning that the melt layer motion code memos@xcite and the dust dynamics code migraine@xcite have already been updated following the present recommendations .    for the * _ latent heat of fusion _ *",

    "<S> the status of the literature is reviewed for several thermophysical properties of pure solid and liquid tungsten that constitute important input for the modelling of intense plasma - surface interaction phenomena that are important for fusion applications . </S>",
    "<S> reliable experimental data are analyzed for the latent heat of fusion , the electrical resistivity , the specific isobaric heat capacity , the thermal conductivity and the mass density from the room temperature up to the boiling point of tungsten as well as for the surface tension and the dynamic viscosity across the liquid state . </S>",
    "<S> analytical expressions of high accuracy are recommended for these thermophysical properties that involved a minimum degree of extrapolations . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> extrapolations were only required for the surface tension and viscosity . </S>"
