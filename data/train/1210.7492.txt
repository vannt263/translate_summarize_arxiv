    "the hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt ) effect was demonstrated in 1956 @xcite and had far - reaching impact , even inspiring some of glauber s seminal work on quantum optics @xcite .",
    "it was the first demonstration of the second - order correlation of visible light and caused significant debate ; some held the belief that it ran counter to the photon theory of light and the experimental results were therefore incorrect @xcite . after a series of papers by hanbury brown and twiss ,",
    "the controversy was largely abated @xcite . however , even in the past few years , papers have been published which argue _ against _ the established interpretation @xcite .",
    "this revived interest comes about from an analogy between the hbt effect and the phenomenon of ghost imaging : simply put , both phenomena depend upon intensity correlations . due to questions surrounding the classical interpretations of ghost imaging ,",
    "similar suspicions were raised upon the hbt effect by scarcelli et al . who suggested that its explanation relies on non - local two photon interference @xcite , although this claim has proved controversial @xcite .",
    "the hbt effect can be demonstrated by a set - up as shown in figure 1 .",
    "light from a distant source impinges upon a balanced beamsplitter and then it propagates down two separate , yet identical , arms of the configuration .",
    "subsequently , each beam falls upon a point - like detector .",
    "when one detector is kept fixed and the other detector is scanned in the transverse plane , we observe a correlation of the intensity in what is known as the hbt effect .",
    "prior to the 1956 hbt paper , such effects had been demonstrated in radio astronomy and were readily accepted as permitting a simple , classical explanation @xcite .",
    "this is because the experiments had all been performed in the regime of large photon - number per mode , in which the classical theory of light easily holds sway @xcite and the shot noise does not contribute a large extent . in this case , we can regard the beamsplitter as creating two identical duplicates of the intensity profile of light . then by the van cittert - zernike theorem it is possible to classically calculate the correlation function as we scan one detector across the beam @xcite .",
    "essentially , the light propagates in such a manner that the classical intensity fluctuations are appreciably correlated at the detection plane over a finite area .",
    "however , the 1956 experiment involved measuring the correlations of optical photons from a mercury arc lamp , in which each mode contains few photons . in this case , it becomes more difficult to understand how it can be that some sort of ` classical ' behaviour emerges even when few photons impinge upon the detectors .",
    "however , it was proven by purcell @xcite , that the experimental results of hbt could be explained by using a classical light field as long as the electrons in the detector were given a quantum treatment .",
    "the success of this ` semi - classical ' model later came to be understood through the generalised formalism of quasi - probability distributions @xcite . in 1963 , during the birth of quantum optics in its current form , sudarshan proved that any experiments involving light which is characterised by a positive , well - behaved @xmath0-representation can also be fully explained by semi - classical methods @xcite .",
    "thermal light  such as that present in the hbt experiment  satisfies this constraint .",
    "the notion of classicality which emerges from the @xmath0-representation ( p - classicality ) , however , is by no means the only notion available . in quantum information ,",
    "a popular and alternative definition of classicality for bipartite states arises from the concept of ` discord ' , a quantity which is defined as the difference between two classically identical expressions for mutual information @xcite .",
    "the discord can be considered to represent the degree of quantum correlations between each part of the bipartition and when the discord is equal to zero , this defines an indication of classicality ( d - classicality ) of the correlations in the state .",
    "it has recently been shown that both notions of classicality are maximally inequivalent @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we follow the example of a recent treatment of ghost imaging in terms of discord @xcite .",
    "since the hbt effect is entirely contingent upon the correlations between each arm , we believe that the very general informational approach to correlations as defined by the mutual information ( total correlations ) and discord ( quantum correlations ) provides an apt foundation for studying ( non)classicality within the scheme .",
    "in particular , we exploit a powerful new variant of mutual information ( and its associated classical and quantum correlations ) defined using the rnyi-@xmath1 entropy for gaussian states @xcite .",
    "this definition of mutual information is intimately related to phase space sampling by homodyne detections which serves as a strong interpretational aid as well as harbouring numerous other desirable properties @xcite .",
    "we establish that , despite the availability of a semi - classical light model , the quantum correlations are indeed significant in the regime of low photon - count per mode in which the original controversy was conceived .",
    "thus , whilst p - classicality holds , we find an undeniable quantum signature as revealed by a relevant portion of quantum correlations ( discord ) .",
    "this is somehow reflected in the physical model proposed by scarcelli et al .",
    "@xcite in which non - local correlations feature in the imaging .",
    "we further find that in the limit of a very low photon - count per mode , the mutual information tends to coincide analytically with the normalised intensity correlations .",
    "a detailed account of the correlations and information measures in terms of rnyi-@xmath1 entropy can be found in @xcite . to summarise ,",
    "the definitions reflect the usual formulation of mutual information , classical correlations and quantum discord @xcite but with the replacement of the von neumann entropy with the rnyi-@xmath1 entropy .",
    "a rnyi-@xmath2 entropy is defined by @xmath3 the von neumann entropy which is used as a conventional measure of quantum information can be obtained by taking the limit @xmath4 , whereas for the purposes of this paper we use the rnyi-@xmath1 entropy , which is defined by @xmath5 , and simply reduces to minus the logarithm of the purity of a quantum state .    for this choice , and given a bipartite gaussian state @xmath6 with marginal states @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) for subsystems @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , the rnyi-@xmath1 mutual information , classical correlations and quantum discord are defined respectively by @xmath11 here , we have introduced a quantum conditional entropy @xmath12 which quantifies the entropy on @xmath9 after a measurement @xmath13 has been performed on @xmath10 . herein lies the subtlety which distinguishes the quantum from classical case . in the classical case , the conditional entropy factors out , and the discord evaluates to @xmath14 . in the quantum case , however , we need to consider the measurement performed when calculating the conditional entropy . since a measurement can disturb the system , the means we can not fully extract all the information of a quantum system .",
    "taking the _ least _ disturbing measurement , and restricting this minimisation to gaussian measurements , we can calculate the gaussian classical correlations @xmath15 and quantum discord @xmath16 as defined in the above equations ( [ eqj]-[eqd ] ) @xcite .",
    "we remind that the mutual information @xmath17 defined in terms of the rnyi-@xmath1 entropy as in equation ( [ eqi ] ) , of a particular gaussian state @xmath6 , corresponds to the shannon continuous mutual information of its wigner distribution .",
    "more generally , it stems from the satisfaction of the strong subadditivity inequality by the rnyi-@xmath1 entropy ( on gaussian states ) , that it can be used to reformulate the core of quantum information theory and to define valid correlation measures in the gaussian setting @xcite .      in order to compute the discord and other correlations for gaussian states , it is necessary to produce the covariance matrix of the relevant quadrature operators @xcite .",
    "such a matrix fully characterises the state up to local displacements . for a general two - mode gaussian state",
    "@xmath6 , any covariance matrix @xmath18 can be written ( by means of local unitaries ) in the standard form , @xmath19    for the hbt setting under consideration ( see fig .  [ scheme ] ) , the entries are easily calculated with some simplifying assumptions : firstly , we choose a large disk - like monochromatic source of area @xmath9 , emitting spatially incoherent light . from this , we take each mode @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the transverse component of the wave - vector ) to be uncorrelated with every other mode in the source plane , and we consider all modes to be zero - mean modes with identical photon - number expectation value @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 , these are common assumptions for intensity interferometric experiments with thermal light @xcite .",
    "this implies that in the source plane @xmath24 , where @xmath25 represent transverse position vectors .",
    "furthermore , we take the beamsplitter to be balanced ( 50:50 ) such that the outcoming mode operators for each branch are @xmath26 now we can calculate the covariance between all four mode operators of relevance @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 ( after which we can rotate into the quadrature basis ) . to do this",
    ", we also need to take into account the propagation of the incoming modes @xmath30 through space .",
    "we consider the fraunhofer propagator @xmath31 which relates the modes in the source plane to the observation plane by @xmath32 as an example , we can then calculate and report here the correlation function @xmath33 , @xmath34 where @xmath35 refers to a bessel function of the first kind and we have defined @xmath36 . continuing along these lines and setting @xmath37",
    "we obtain a covariance matrix @xmath38 in standard form as in equation  ( [ covmat ] ) , where @xmath39      from the previous analysis , and using the results of @xcite , we can obtain the explicit expressions for the rnyi-@xmath1 mutual information , classical correlations and discord as functions of @xmath40 , @xmath41,\\\\ \\mathcal{j}(a|b)&= \\ln\\left[\\frac{a^2+a}{a^2+a - c^2}\\right],\\\\ \\mathcal{d}(a|b)&= \\ln\\left[\\frac{a^2+a^3-ac^2}{a^2+a^3-ac^2-c^2}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we find it relevant at this point to recall also the formula for the normalised intensity correlation function in our scheme . defining the intensity in each beam @xmath29 as @xmath42",
    ", we have the well established result @xcite @xmath43",
    "+    to begin with , it is interesting to see how the classical and quantum correlations behave as we scan the detector for fixed values of @xmath22 . in all the following results",
    ", we have normalised the total correlations to a maximum value of 1 by plotting @xmath44 ; and similarly for quantum and classical ones . for large @xmath22 as in figure  [ graphs](a ) , it is apparent that the quantum correlations decay faster than the classical ones and also contribute a much smaller part of the total correlations even at their peak .",
    "however , for very small values of @xmath22 as in figure  [ graphs](b ) this is no longer the case : we see that both classical and quantum correlations degrade at the same rate and are approximately equal .",
    "this result stems from the fact that the purity of a gaussian state relates only to the number of thermal photons @xcite present and for small photons counts , we obtain high purity .",
    "recall that for pure states , @xmath45 .    to better understand the behaviour of the correlations",
    "as we vary @xmath22 , it is useful to plot changes against @xmath22 at fixed @xmath40 , see fig .",
    "[ graphs](c ) .",
    "it is apparent that the total correlations are composed of a much greater portion of classical correlations than quantum correlations at high photon - count per mode .",
    "this gels closely with our intuition : in the regime of high brightness , the quantum component of correlations becomes very small .",
    "it is thus easy to see why in certain regimes , the effect is simple to explain classically : it appears that high photon counts wash - out quantumness , increasing the mixedness and simultaneously quashing the presence of discord .",
    "returning to the regime of high purity ( and low photon - count ) , we find a notable result . the total correlations as quantified by @xmath17 match almost exactly the normalised intensity correlations of equation ( [ intcorr ] ) .",
    "notice once again that classical and quantum correlations ( discord ) both contribute in equal halves to such total correlations , and thus to the manifestation of the hbt effect itself in this regime .",
    "very remarkably , for _ any _ form of cross - correlation of narrowband , thermal light , the correspondence between mutual information and normalised intensity correlations holds analytically in the weak - light regime ( up to the third order in @xmath22 ) , as proven in the appendix .",
    "this provides an intriguing connection and a convenient short - cut for calculating and/or measuring experimentally these correlations .",
    "we have provided an example of how the rnyi-@xmath1 entropy @xcite can serve as a powerful tool for analysing the behaviour of correlations in the gaussian world .",
    "the presented results , visually summarised in fig .  [ graphs ] , encapsulate not only information about the correlations but also provide , at a mere glance , information about the purity .",
    "they also reveal , significantly , that in low - illumination conditions the normalised mutual information can be properly approximated by the normalised intensity correlation .",
    "a somehow similar result has been recently found in the context of thermal light ghost imaging , whereby a properly defined coarse - grained mutual information has been found to match the signal - to - noise ratio of the scheme in the limit of low illumination @xcite .    applying the tools of quantum information to the hbt effect",
    "clarifies the source of the disagreement in its interpretation and unveils a quantifier of quantumness which behaves particularly intuitively .",
    "we have shown that in the limit of a high photon - count per mode the correlations are mostly classical , which matches observations made as far back as the 1950s that the classical ` wave - like ' features of light emerge in this regime @xcite .",
    "we find that for very low photon - counts , however , the quantum correlations are no longer negligible and it was in this regime where the effect originally caused ripples of controversy .",
    "this provides a significant example of an insufficiency of following a single definition of classicality .",
    "whilst scarcelli et al . interpreted their finding of non - local two - photon interference as contradicting previous semi - classical interpretations @xcite , others have shown this to be incorrect @xcite .",
    "the actuality of the situation , and the source of confusion , is that the p - classicality criterion is simply unable to resolve the quantumness in the system .    on the other hand",
    "the present discord analysis _ does _ support the finding that there is a significant presence of quantum effects in the light correlations at low illuminations .",
    "as previously mentioned , the strong discrepancy between both definitions of classicality has been recently delineated on rigorous footings @xcite .",
    "it is sufficient for our purposes though to note that the p - classicality is equivalent to separability for bipartite ( squeezed ) thermal states @xcite while discord captures all quantum correlations beyond entanglement ( in fact , any two correlated gaussian states will have non - zero discord @xcite ) .    in summary , we have utilised a definition of ` quantumness ' of correlations based on rnyi-@xmath1 gaussian discord @xcite , which is found to vary continuously from its largest relative value in the low - illumination , high - purity regime , shrinking as the illumination is increased .",
    "we believe that this is a naturally relevant way of looking at classicality for such interferometry experiments since the p - classicality reveals very little information and holds even in the seemingly non - classical regime of very few photons .",
