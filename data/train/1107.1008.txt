    "several complementary cosmological observations guide us that our universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion in the current era @xcite . from the observations of wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )",
    "satellite which gathered data about the cosmic microwave background radiation , such a cosmic acceleration is produced by a so - called dark energy ( de ) @xcite .",
    "such a new element of the universe , capable of accelerating , must be , in accordance with the friedmann equation , have a pressure less than minus one third of the energy density .",
    "the notion of a cosmic medium possessing negative pressure is not new in cosmology .",
    "the very first proposal for dark energy is the cosmological constant denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "originally proposed by einstein to construct a theoretical model of the universe such that the spherical configuration of matter in the universe is balanced with the negative pressure of cosmological constant . thereby creating a static universe , in the conformity of the notions held by many scientists of that time .",
    "the origin of cosmic acceleration in recent time needs @xmath0 but it faces serious problems of fine tuning ( the value of @xmath0 is several orders of magnitude larger then estimated from the empirical results ) and cosmic coincidence problem ( the energy density of matter and dark energy component are approximately same in our presence ) .",
    "then theorists looked for other candidates of dark energy .",
    "there has been a wide variety of theoretical models of dark energy constructed in the literature including quintessence , phantom energy , chaplygin gas , tachyon and dilaton dark energy etc , see @xcite for further details .",
    "the quintessence and phantom energy models are based on spatially homogeneous and time dependent scalar fields , in conformity of the cosmological principle .",
    "the lagrangians for the quintessence ( phantom energy ) has positive ( negative ) kinetic energy . where quintessence faces still fine tuning problem of the parameters of its potential , while the phantom energy gives very esoteric possibilities of big rip and black hole evaporations @xcite .",
    "quintessence as a model of dark energy relies on the suitable choice of the potential function or the potential energy of scalar fields .",
    "it is also possible that the cosmic acceleration could appear due to modification of the kinetic energy of the scalar fields .",
    "such modifications are termed non - canonical .",
    "the kinetically driven cosmic acceleration was originally proposed as a model for inflation , namely k - inflation @xcite , and then as a model for dark energy , namely k - essence @xcite .",
    "this model is free from fine - tuning and anthropic arguments .",
    "k - essence has been proposed as a possible means of explaining the coincidence problem of the universe beginning to accelerate only at the present epoch @xcite . instead , k - essence is based on the idea of a dynamical attractor solution which causes it to act as a cosmological constant only at the onset of matter - domination . consequently , k - essence overtakes the matter density and induces cosmic acceleration at about the present epoch . in some models of k - essence , the cosmic acceleration continues forever while in others , it continues for a finite duration @xcite .    in the last years",
    ", the k - essence model has received much attention .",
    "it is still worth investigating in a systematic way the possible cosmological behavior of the k - essence .",
    "quite recently , a model named g - essence is proposed @xcite which is a more generalized version of k - essence .",
    "in fact , the g - essence contains , as particular cases , two important models : k - essence and f - essence . note that f - essence is the fermionic counterpart of k - essence .    to our knowledge , in the literature",
    "there are relatively few works on dark energy models with fermionic fields .",
    "however , in the recent years several approaches were made to explain the accelerated expansion by taking fermionic fields as the gravitational sources of energy ( see e.g. refs .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the fermionic field plays very important role in : ( i ) isotropization of initially anisotropic spacetime ; ( ii ) formation of singularity free cosmological solutions ; ( iii ) explaining late - time acceleration .    a very appealing proposal to describe the dark sector are the so - called unified models .",
    "the prototype of such model is the chaplygin gas . in the unified models , dark energy and dark matter",
    "are described by a single fluid , which behaves as ordinary matter in the past , and as a cosmological constant term in the future . in this sense , it interpolates the different periods of evolution of the universe , including the present state of accelerated expansion .",
    "the chaplygin gas model leads to very good results when confronted with the observational data of supernova type ia . concerning the matter power spectrum data , the statistic analysis leads to results competitive with the @xmath0cdm model , but the unified ( called quartessence ) scenario must be imposed from the beginning .",
    "it means that the only pressureless component is the usual baryonic one , otherwise there is a conflict between the constraints obtained from the matter power spectrum and the supernova tests .",
    "note that many variations of the chaplygin gas model have been proposed in the literature .",
    "one of them is the so - called modified chaplygin gas model .",
    "it is important that the mcg model belongs to the class of a unified models of dark energy and dark matter . in this context , it is important to study the relation between mcg and the other unified models of dark energy and dark matter .",
    "for example , in @xcite relationship between mcg and k - essence was established . in this paper , we have modeled mcg in the framework of f - essence cosmology . by constructing an equation connecting the mcg and the f - essence , we solve it to obtain explicitly the pressure and energy density of mcg .",
    "as special cases , we obtain both positive and negative pressure solutions for suitable choices of free parameters .    this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the f - essence formalism . in section iii , we briefly discuss modified chaplygin gas and its connection with the f - essence . in section iv",
    ", we construct a governing differential equation of our model and solve it for several special cases and a general case .",
    "conclusion is presented in the last section . in the appendix we provide the derivation of the equations of motion of g - essence , k - essence and f - essence .",
    "let us briefly present some basics of f - essence .",
    "its action has the form @xcite @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the fermion field and its adjoint , respectively , the dagger represents complex conjugation and @xmath4 is the ricci scalar .",
    "the fermionic fields are treated here as classically commuting fields ( see e.g. refs .",
    "what we mean by a classical fermionic field is a set of four complex - valued space - time functions that transform according to the spinor representation of the lorenz group .",
    "the existence of such fields is crucial in our work since despite the fact that fermions are described by quantized fermionic fields which do not have a classical limit , we assume such classical fields exist and use them as matter fields coupled to gravity .",
    "a possible justification for the existence of classical fermionic fields is given in the appendix of reference @xcite .",
    "so for a more extensive and physically detailed discussion of the properties of such classical fermionic fields we refer to this fundamental work @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath5 is the lagrangian density of the fermionic field , the canonical kinetic term has the form @xmath6.\\ ] ] moreover , @xmath7 are the generalized dirac - pauli matrices satisfying the clifford algebra @xmath8 where the braces denote the anti - commutation relation . @xmath9 denotes the tetrad or `` vierbein '' while the covariant derivatives are given by @xmath10 above , the fermionic connection @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12\\gamma^{\\sigma}\\gamma^{\\delta},\\ ] ] with @xmath13 denoting the christoffel symbols .",

    "we write the final form of these equations .",
    "we have @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the energy density and pressure of the fermionic field . if @xmath27 then from the system ( 13)-(18 ) we get the corresponding equations of the einstein - dirac model . at last",
    ", we note that f - essence is the particular case of g - essence for which the energy density and pressure are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the canonical kinetic term for the scalar field @xmath30 ( see the appendix ) .",
    "in the cosmological context , the chaplygin gas was first suggested as an alternative to quintessence and was demonstrated to have an increasing @xmath0 ( cosmological constant ) behavior for the evolution of the universe @xcite .",
    "the eos of the mcg dark energy model was proposed by benaoum @xcite as an exotic fluid which could explain the cosmic accelerated expansion .",
    "later on , it was shown that the eos of mcg is valid from the radiation era to @xmath0cdm model @xcite .",
    "the mcg parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 have been constrained by the cosmic microwave background cmb data @xcite .",
    "the stable scaling solutions ( attractor ) of the freidmann equation have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the mcg is given by @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath32 are positive constants and @xmath35 in the light of @xmath36year wmap and the sdss data , the mcg best fits the data by choosing @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the dynamical attractor for the mcg exists at @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 ) , hence mcg can do the phantom crossing from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , independent to the choice of initial conditions @xcite .",
