    "<S> the 100 random fields are spread uniformly over the 7000  deg@xmath28 region of the apm catalogue in the southern galactic hemisphere . at the median redshift of the survey ( @xmath29 ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath30 subtends about 20  degrees , so the two strips are @xmath31 long and have widths of @xmath32 ( south ) and @xmath33 ( north ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the sample is limited to be brighter than an extinction - corrected magnitude of @xmath34 ( using the extinction maps of schlegel et  al.1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this limit gives a good match between the density on the sky of galaxies and 2df fibres . due to clustering , however , the number in a given field varies considerably . to make efficient use of 2df </S>",
    "<S> , we employ an adaptive tiling algorithm to cover the survey area with the minimum number of 2df fields . with this algorithm </S>",
    "<S> we are able to achieve a 93% sampling rate with on average fewer than 5% wasted fibres per field . over the whole area of the survey </S>",
    "<S> there are in excess of 250,000 galaxies .    after an extensive period of commissioning of the 2df instrument , </S>",
    "<S> 2dfgrs observing began in earnest in may 1997 , and terminated in april 2002 . in total , observations were made of 899 fields , yielding redshifts and identifications for 232,529 galaxies , 13976 stars and 172 qsos , at an overall completeness of 93% . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy redshifts are assigned a quality flag from 1 to 5 , where the probability of error is highest at low @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> most analyses are restricted to @xmath36 galaxies , of which there are currently 221,496 . </S>",
    "<S> an interim data release took place in july 2001 , consisting of approximately 100,000 galaxies ( see colless et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> a public release of the full photometric and spectroscopic database is scheduled for july 2003 .    </S>",
    "<S> the colless et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2001 ) paper details the practical steps that are necessary in order to work with a survey of this sort . </S>",
    "<S> the 2dfgrs does not consist of a simple region sampled with 100% efficiency , and it is therefore necessary to use a number of masks in order to interpret the data . </S>",
    "<S> two of these concern the input catalogue : the boundaries of this catalogue , including ` drilled ' regions around bright stars where galaxies could not be detected ; also , revisions to the photometric calibration mean that in practice the survey depth varies slightly with position on the sky . </S>",
    "<S> a futher mask arises from the way in which the sky is tessellated into 2df tiles : near the survey edges and near internal holes , a lack of overlaps mean that the sampling fraction falls to about 50% . finally , the spectroscopic success rate of each spectroscopic observation fluctuated according to the observing conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the median redshift yield was approximately 95% , but with a tail towards poorer data . </S>",
    "<S> the terminal stages of 2dfgrs observing were in fact devoted to re - observing these fields of low completeness ; nevertheless , approximately 10% of fields have completeness lower than 80% . </S>",
    "<S> this variable sampling makes quantification of the large scale structure more difficult , particularly for any analysis requiring relatively uniform contiguous areas . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effective survey ` mask ' can be measured precisely enough that it can be allowed for in analyses of the galaxy distribution .    beyond the basic data of positions , magnitudes and redshifts , it is important on physical grounds to be able to divide the 2dfgrs database into different categories of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this has been done in two different ways . </S>",
    "<S> spectral classification of 2dfgrs galaxies was performed by folkes et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1999 ) and madgwick et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> principal component analysis was used to split galaxies into a superposition of a small number of templates . </S>",
    "<S> not all of these are robust , owing to uncalibrated spectral distortions in the 2df instrument , but it was possible to derive a robust classification parameter ( termed @xmath37 ) from the templates , which effectively measures the emission - line strength ( closely related to the star - formation rate ) . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies were divided into four spectral classes ; their mean spectra and separate luminosity functions are shown in figure  2 .     </S>",
    "<S> = 0.49 1em = 0.49    this classification method has the drawback that it can not be used beyond @xmath38 , where h@xmath39 is lost from the spectra . </S>",
    "<S> also , the fibres do not cover the whole galaxy ( although madgwick et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2002 show that aperture corrections are not large in practice ) . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , we have been able to obtain total broad - band colours for the 2dfgrs galaxies , using the data from the supercosmos sky surveys ( hambly et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these yield @xmath40 from the same uk schmidt plates as used in the original apm survey , but with improved linearity and smaller random errors ( 0.09 mag rms relative to the sdss edr data ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath41 plates are of similar quality , so that we are able to divide galaxies by colour , with an rms in photographic @xmath42 of about 0.13 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic calibration uncertainties are negligible by comparison , and are at the level of 0.04 mag . </S>",
    "<S> rms in each band . </S>",
    "<S> figure  3 shows that the colour information divides ` passive ' galaxies with little active star formation cleanly from the remainder , uniformly over the whole redshift range of the 2dfgrs .     </S>",
    "<S> = 0.43 1em = 0.43    as an immediate application , we can display the spatial distribution of 2dfgrs galaxies divided according to colour ( figure  4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most striking aspect of this image is how closely both sets of galaxies follow the same structure . </S>",
    "<S> the passive subset display a more skeletal appearance , as expected owing to morphological segregation of ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> a red - selected survey such as sdss will appear more similar to the passive subset of the 2dfgrs , with relatively low sampling of the more active spectral type 24 .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest statistic for studying clustering in the galaxy distribution is the the two - point correlation function , @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this measures the excess probability over random of finding a pair of galaxies with a separation in the plane of the sky @xmath44 and a line - of - sight separation @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> because the radial separation in redshift space includes the peculiar velocity as well as the spatial separation , @xmath43 will be anisotropic . on small scales </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function is extended in the radial direction due to the large peculiar velocities in non - linear structures such as groups and clusters  this is the well - known ` finger - of - god ' effect . on large scales </S>",
    "<S> it is compressed in the radial direction due to the coherent infall of galaxies onto mass concentrations  the kaiser effect ( kaiser 1987 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.45    to estimate @xmath43 we compare the observed count of galaxy pairs with the count estimated from a random distribution following the same selection function both on the sky and in redshift as the observed galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we apply optimal weighting to minimise the uncertainties due to cosmic variance and poisson noise . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift - space correlation function for the 2dfgrs computed in this way is shown in figure  5 . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation - function results display very clearly two signatures of redshift - space distortions . </S>",
    "<S> the ` fingers of god ' from small - scale random velocities are very clear , as indeed has been the case from the first redshift surveys ( e.g. davis & peebles 1983 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is the first time that the large - scale flattening from coherent infall has been seen in detail . </S>",
    "<S> an initial analysis of this effect was performed in peacock et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2001 ) , and the final database was analysed by hawkins et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the degree of large - scale flattening is determined by the total mass density parameter , @xmath46 , and the biasing of the galaxy distribution . on large scales </S>",
    "<S> , it should be correct to assume a linear bias model , with correlation functions @xmath47 , so that the redshift - space distortion on large scales depends on the combination @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this is modified by the finger - of - god effect , which is significant even at large scales and dominant at small scales . </S>",
    "<S> the effect can be modelled by introducing a parameter @xmath49 , which represents the rms pairwise velocity dispersion of the galaxies in collapsed structures , @xmath49 ( see e.g. ballinger et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1996 ) . </S>",
    "<S> considering both these effects , and marginalising over @xmath49 , the best estimate of @xmath50 and its 68% confidence interval according to hawkins et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) is @xmath51 the quoted error is slightly larger than in peacock et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2001 ) : mainly , this reflects the decision of hawkins et al . to concentrate on the better sampled volume at @xmath52 , although a more detailed comparison with mock data also indicates that the previous errors were too small by a factor of about 1.2 .    </S>",
    "<S> our measurement of @xmath53 can only be used to determine @xmath54 if the bias is known . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss below two methods by which the bias parameter may be inferred , which in fact favour a low degree of bias . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , there are other uncertainties in converting a measurement of @xmath50 to a figure for @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the 2dfgrs has a median redshift of 0.11 ; with weighting , the mean redshift in hawkins et al . is 0.15 , and our measurement should be interpreted as @xmath50 at that epoch . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal weighting also means that our mean luminosity is high : it is approximately 1.4 times the characteristic luminosity , @xmath10 , of the overall galaxy population ( folkes et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1999 ; madgwick et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we need to quantify the luminosity dependence of clustering .    </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity is an effect that was controversial for a number of years . using the apm - stromlo redshift survey , loveday et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1995 ) claimed that there was no trend of clustering amplitude with luminosity , except possibly at the very lowest luminosities . in contradiction , the ssrs study of benoist et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1996 ) suggested that the strength of galaxy clustering increased monotonically with luminosity , with a particularly marked effect for galaxies above @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter result was arguably more plausible , based on what we know of luminosity functions and morphological segregation . </S>",
    "<S> it has been clear for many years that elliptical galaxies display a higher correlation amplitude than spirals ( davis & geller 1976 ) . </S>",
    "<S> since ellipticals are also more luminous on average , as shown above , some trend with luminosity is to be expected , but the challenge is to detect it .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.6    the difficulty with measuring the dependence of @xmath55 on luminosity is that cosmic variance can mask the signal of interest . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to analyse volume - limited samples in which galaxies of different luminosities are compared in the same volume of space . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison was undertaken by norberg et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2001 ) , who measured real - space correlation functions via the projection @xmath56 , demonstrating that it was possible to obtain consistent results in both ngp and sgp . </S>",
    "<S> a very clear detection of luminosity - dependent clustering was achieved , as shown in figure  6 . </S>",
    "<S> the results can be described by a linear dependence of effective bias parameter on luminosity : @xmath57 and the scale - length of the real - space correlation function for @xmath10 galaxies is approximately @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this trend is in qualitative agreement with the results of benoist et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1996 ) , but in fact these workers gave a stronger dependence on luminosity than is indicated by the 2dfgrs . finally , with spectral classifications , it is possible to measure the dependence of clustering both on luminosity and on spectral type , to see to what extent morphological segregation is responsible for this result . </S>",
    "<S> norberg et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) show that , in fact , the principal effect seems to be with luminosity : @xmath55 increases with @xmath59 for all spectral types . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable from a theoretical point of view , in which the principal cause of different clustering amplitudes is the mass of halo that hosts a galaxy ( e.g. cole & kaiser 1989 ; mo & white 1996 ; kauffman , nusser & steinmetz 1997 ) .    finally , these results would lead us to infer that the lf must change in strongly clumped regions , shifting to higher luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> such an effect has been sought for many years , but always yielded null results </S>",
    "<S> . however , de propris et al . ( </S>",
    "<S> 2002 ) have shown that @xmath10 in rich clusters does obey a shift with respect to the global value , being brighter by @xmath60 mag .    </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the key aim of the 2dfgrs was to perform an accurate measurement of the 3d clustering power spectrum , in order to improve on the apm result , which was deduced by deprojection of angular clustering ( baugh & efstathiou 1993 , 1994 ) . the results of this direct estimation of the 3d power spectrum are shown in figure  7 . </S>",
    "<S> this power - spectrum estimate uses the fft - based approach of feldman , kaiser & peacock ( 1994 ) , and needs to be interpreted with care . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , it is a raw redshift - space estimate , so that the power beyond @xmath61 is severely damped by fingers of god . on large scales , </S>",
    "<S> the power is enhanced , both by the kaiser effect and by the luminosity - dependent clustering discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the fkp estimator yields the true power convolved with the window function . </S>",
    "<S> this modifies the power significantly on large scales ( roughly a 20% correction ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have made an approximate correction for this in figure  7 . </S>",
    "<S> the precision of the power measurement appears to be encouragingly high , and the next task is to perform a detailed fit of physical power spectra , taking full account of the window effects . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize here results from this analysis ( percival et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.55    the fundamental assumption is that , on large scales , linear biasing applies , so that the nonlinear galaxy power spectrum in redshift space has a shape identical to that ow linear theory in real space . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this assumption is valid for @xmath62 ; the detailed justification comes from analyzing realistic mock data derived from @xmath63-body simulations ( cole et al 1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model free parameters are thus the primordial spectral index , @xmath64 , the hubble parameter , @xmath65 , the total matter density , @xmath46 , and the baryon fraction , @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the vacuum energy does not enter . </S>",
    "<S> initially , we show results assuming @xmath67 ; this assumption is relaxed later .    in order to compare the 2dfgrs power spectrum to members of the cdm family of theoretical models , </S>",
    "<S> it is essential to have a proper understanding of the full covariance matrix of the data : the convolving effect of the window function causes the power at adjacent @xmath68 values to be correlated . </S>",
    "<S> this covariance matrix was estimated by applying the survey window to a library of gaussian realisations of linear density fields . </S>",
    "<S> similar results were obtained using a covariance matrix estimated from a set of mock catalogues . </S>",
    "<S> it is now possible to explore the space of cdm models , and likelihood contours in @xmath66 versus @xmath69 are shown in figure  8 . at each point in this surface </S>",
    "<S> we have marginalized by integrating the likelihood surface over the two free parameters , @xmath65 and the power spectrum amplitude . assuming a uniform prior for @xmath65 over a factor of 2 is arguably over - cautious , and we have therefore added a gaussian prior @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to multiplying by the likelihood from external constraints such as the hst key project ( freedman et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) ; this has only a minor effect on the results .     </S>",
    "<S> = 0.43 1em = 0.43    figure  8 shows that there is a degeneracy between @xmath69 and the baryonic fraction @xmath66 . however , there are two local maxima in the likelihood , one with @xmath71 and @xmath72 baryons , plus a secondary solution @xmath73 and @xmath74 baryons . </S>",
    "<S> the high - density model can be rejected through a variety of arguments , and the preferred solution is @xmath75 the 2dfgrs data are compared to the best - fit linear power spectra convolved with the window function in figure  8 . </S>",
    "<S> this shows where the two branches of solutions come from : the low - density model fits the overall shape of the spectrum with relatively small ` wiggles ' , while the solution at @xmath76 provides a better fit to the bump at @xmath77 , but fits the overall shape less well . </S>",
    "<S> a preliminary analysis of @xmath12 from the full final dataset shows that @xmath12 becomes smoother : the high - baryon solution becomes disfavoured , and the uncertainties narrow slightly around the lower - density solution : @xmath78 ; @xmath79 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare these conclusions with other constraints . </S>",
    "<S> these are shown on figure  8 , assuming @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> latest estimates of the deuterium to hydrogen ratio in qso spectra combined with big - bang nucleosynthesis theory predict @xmath81 ( burles et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) , which translates to the shown locus of @xmath82 vs @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray cluster analysis predicts a baryon fraction @xmath84 ( evrard 1997 ) which is within @xmath85 of our value . </S>",
    "<S> these loci intersect very close to our preferred model . moreover , these results are in good agreement with independent estimates of the total density and baryon content from data on cmb anisotropies ( e.g. netterfield et al . 2001 ; pryke et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2002 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the main point to emphasise here is that the 2dfgrs results are not greatly sensitive to the assumed tilt of the primordial spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we have used cmb results to motivate the choice of @xmath67 , as discussed below , but it is clear that very substantial tilts are required to alter the conclusions significantly : @xmath86 would be required to turn zero baryons into the preferred model .    </S>",
    "<S> the main residual worry about accepting the above conclusions is probably whether the assumption of linear bias can really be valid . in general , concentration towards higher - density regions </S>",
    "<S> both raises the amplitude of clustering , but also steepens the correlations , so that bias is largest on small scales . </S>",
    "<S> one way in which this issue can be studied is to use the split by colour introduced above . </S>",
    "<S> figure  9 shows the power spectra for the 2dfgrs divided in this way . </S>",
    "<S> the shapes are almost identical ( perhaps not so surprising , since the cosmic variance effects are closely correlated in these co - spatial samples ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , what is impressive is that the relative bias is almost precisely independent of scale , even though the passive subset is rather strongly biased relative to the active subset ( relative @xmath87 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this provides some reassurance that the large - scale @xmath12 reflects the underlying properties of the dark matter , rather than depending on the particular class of galaxies used to measure it .     </S>",
    "<S> = 0.43 1em = 0.43    the 2dfgrs power spectrum contains important information about the key parameters of the cosmological model , but we have seen that additional assumptions are needed , in particular the values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> observations of cmb anisotropies can in principle measure most of the cosmological parameters , and combination with the 2dfgrs can lift most of the degeneracies inherent in the cmb - only analysis . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore of interest to see what emerges from a joint analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> these issues are discussed in efstathiou et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cmb data alone contain two important degeneracies : the ` geometrical ' and ` tensor ' degeneracies . in the former case </S>",
    "<S> , one can evade the commonly - stated cmb conclusion that the universe is flat , by adjusting both @xmath88 and @xmath65 to extreme values . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> , a model with a large tensor component can be made to resemble a zero - tensor model with large blue tilt ( @xmath89 ) and high baryon content . </S>",
    "<S> efstathiou et al . ( 2002 ) show that adding the 2dfgrs data removes the first degeneracy , but not the second . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable : if we take the view that the cmb determines the physical density @xmath90 , then a measurement of @xmath83 from 2dfgrs gives both @xmath46 and @xmath65 separately in principle , removing one of the degrees of freedom on which the geometrical degeneracy depends . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the 2dfgrs alone constrains the baryon content weakly , so this does not remove the scope for the tensor degeneracy .    on the basis of this analysis , we can therefore be confident that the universe is very nearly flat ( @xmath91 ) , so it is defensible to assume hereafter that this is exactly true </S>",
    "<S> . the importance of tensors will of course be one of the key questions for cosmology over the next several years , but it is interesting to consider the limit in which these are negligible . in this case , the standard model for structure formation contains a vector of only 6 parameters : @xmath92 of these , the optical depth to last scattering , @xmath93 , is almost entirely degenerate with the normalization , @xmath35  and indeed with the bias parameter ; we discuss this below . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining four parameters are pinned down very precisely : using the latest cmb data plus the 2dfrgs power spectrum , we obtain @xmath94 or an overall density parameter of @xmath95 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable how well these figures agree with completely independent determinations : @xmath96 from the hst key project ( mould et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2000 ; freedman et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) ; @xmath97 ( burles et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this gives confidence that the tensor component must indeed be sub - dominant . </S>",
    "<S> for further details of this analysis , see percival et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the above conclusions were obtained by considering the shapes of the cmb and galaxy power spectra . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is also of great interest to consider the amplitude of mass fluctuations , since a comparison with the galaxy power spectrum allows us to infer the degree of bias directly . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis was performed by lahav et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) . given assumed values for the cosmological parameters </S>",
    "<S> , the present - day linear normalization of the mass spectrum ( e.g. @xmath98 ) can be inferred . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to define a corresponding measure for the galaxies , @xmath99 , such that we can express the bias parameter as @xmath100 in practice , we define @xmath99 to be the value required to fit a cdm model to the power - spectrum data on linear scales ( @xmath101 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a final necessary complication of the notation is that we need to distinguish between the apparent values of @xmath99 as measured in redshift space ( @xmath102 ) and the real - space value that would be measured in the absence of redshift - space distortions ( @xmath103 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is the latter value that is required in order to estimate the bias .    </S>",
    "<S> a model grid covering the range @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 was considered . </S>",
    "<S> the primordial index was assumed to be @xmath67 initially , and the dependence on @xmath64 studied separately . for fixed ` concordance </S>",
    "<S> model ' parameters @xmath67 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and a hubble constant @xmath111 , we find that the amplitude of 2dfgrs galaxies in redshift space is @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> correcting for redshift - space distortions as detailed above reduces this to 0.86 in real space . applying a correction for a mean luminosity of @xmath113 using the recipe of norberg et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2001 ) , we obtain an estimate of @xmath114 , with a negligibly small random error . in order to obtain present - day bias figures </S>",
    "<S> , we need to know the evolution of galaxy clustering to @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> existing data on clustering evolution reveals very slow changes : higher bias at early times largely cancels the evolution of the dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore assume no evolution in @xmath116 .    </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath98 for the dark matter can be deduced from the cmb fits : @xmath117 where the error bar includes both data errors and theory uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the unsatisfactory feature is the degeneracy with the optical depth to last scattering . </S>",
    "<S> for reionization at redshift @xmath118 , we would have @xmath119 ; it is unlikely that @xmath93 can be hugely larger ( e.g. loeb & barkana 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> although direct removal of this theoretical prejudice is desirable ( and will be possible with future cmb data ) , it seems reasonable to assume that the true value of @xmath98 must be very close to 0.76 . within the errors </S>",
    "<S> , this agrees perfectly with our @xmath120 , implying that @xmath10 galaxies are very nearly exactly unbiased . </S>",
    "<S> as we have seen , there are large variations in the clustering amplitude with type , so that this outcome must be something of a coincidence .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , this conclusion of near - unity bias was reinforced in a completely independent way , by using the measurements of the bispectrum of galaxies in the 2dfgrs ( verde et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as it is based on three - point correlations , this statistic is sensitive to the filamentary nature of the galaxy distribution  which is a signature of nonlinear evolution . </S>",
    "<S> one can therefore split the degeneracy between the amplitude of dark - matter fluctuations and the amount of bias . at the effective redshift and luminosity of their sample ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) , verde et al . found @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> although the corrections to zero redshift and to luminosity @xmath10 are probably significant , this reinforces the point that on large scales there is no substantial difference in clustering between typical galaxies and the dark matter ( small scales , of course , are another matter entirely ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the 2dfgrs is the first 3d survey of the local universe to achieve 100,000 redshifts , almost an order of magnitude improvement on previous work . </S>",
    "<S> the final database should yield definitive results on a number of key issues relating to galaxy clustering . for details of the current status of the 2dfgrs , see http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/2dfgrs . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this site gives details of the 2dfgrs public release policy , in which approximately the first half of the survey data were made available in june 2001 , with the complete survey database to be made public by mid-2003 . </S>",
    "<S> some key results of the survey to date may be summarized as follows :    the galaxy luminosity function has been measured precisely as a function of spectral type ( folkes et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1999 ; madgwick et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2002 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of galaxy clustering has been shown to depend on luminosity ( norberg et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relative bias is @xmath124 .    </S>",
    "<S> the redshift - space correlation function has been measured out to @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> redshift - space distortions imply @xmath0 , for galaxies with @xmath126 .    the galaxy power spectrum has been measured to high accuracy ( 1015% rms ) over about a decade in scale at @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are very well matched by an @xmath67 cdm model with @xmath127 and 16% baryons .    combining the power spectrum results with current cmb data , </S>",
    "<S> very tight constraints are obtained on cosmological parameters . for a scalar - dominated flat model , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath128 , and @xmath129 , independent of external data .    </S>",
    "<S> results from the cmb comparison imply a large - scale bias parameter consistent with unity . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is also reached in a completely independent way via the bispectrum analysis of verde et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> overall , these results provide precise support for a cosmological model that is flat , with @xmath130 , to a tolerance of 10% in each figure . </S>",
    "<S> although the @xmath88cdm model has been claimed to have problems in matching galaxy - scale observations , it clearly works extremely well on large scales , and any proposed replacement for cdm will have to maintain this agreement . </S>",
    "<S> so far , there has been no need to invoke either tilt of the scalar spectrum , or a tensor component in the cmb . </S>",
    "<S> if this situation is to change , the most likely route will be via new cmb data , combined with the key complementary information that the large - scale structure in the 2dfgrs can provide . </S>"
