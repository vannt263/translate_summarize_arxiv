    "bell - inequality experiments , quantum computation , and teleportation of quantum states require quantum objects that are entangled .",
    "cooper pairs in superconductors are spin singlets and are , therefore , suitable sources of entanglement",

    "nonlocal transport properties have been seen experimentally in @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 heterostructures @xcite . the microscopic origin of the effects of ec and car , as well as possible ways in which these can be used for the production of locally separated entangled quasiparticles , remain to be understood theoretically .",
    "recently , theoretical studies of car have been performed for various types of junctions @xcite .",
    "modeling of nonlocal effects by means of perturbation theory using an effective tunnel hamiltonian @xcite has indeed provided ec and car , the signal being , however , vanishingly small ( of the order of the fourth power in interface transparency ) . consequent pioneering efforts to include disorder @xcite and weak localization @xcite have found enhanced effects , but still not to the level of experimental observations , so that the question as to the microscopic origin of car still remains open .     structure , which is voltage biased accross the first interface .",
    "an incoming electron from the left normal metal electrode , can undergo three different processes that contribute to the current : andreev reflection ( ar ) , elastic cotunneling ( ec ) and crossed andreev reflection ( car ) .",

    "we present a mechanism in which car exists by virtue of the proximity induced superconducting correlations in the electrodes , for arbitrary barrier transparency .",
    "the proximity effect is the essential new ingredient in our model , giving a large contribution to car , of second order in transparency , in contrast to the nonlocal effects of tunnel hamiltonian models .",
