    "schwinger boson representation is by now a well known tool in the study of quantum spin systems  @xcite . in this method ,",
    "each spin operator is represented by two schwinger bosons .",
    "in contrast to holstein - primakoff bosons  @xcite , the schwinger boson representation of spin operators does not involve square roots .",
    "furthermore , while the vacuum state of holstein - primakoff bosons has to be a broken symmetry state , this is not the case for schwinger bosons .",
    "instead , long - ranged order ( lro ) is a result of condensation of the schwinger bosons  @xcite .",
    "thus , using schwinger bosons allows one to naturally address both the magnetically disordered and ordered states .    using the schwinger boson representation ,",
    "the quantum spin hamiltonian is mapped onto an interacting boson hamiltonian , which can then be approximated by a self - consistent non - interacting hamiltonian using mean field theory ( mft ) .",
    "in such a mean field theory , a non - zero mean field amplitude corresponds to short - ranged order ( sro ) .",
    "long range order exists only if for a given temperature , the mean field hamiltonian gives rise to bose condensation .",
    "the ability of the mean field theory to address both short - ranged and long - ranged order is perhaps its most appealing feature , especially for 1d and 2d systems , where exact solutions has shown that lro is destroyed at any finite temperature . for the heisenberg ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic hamiltonian on a d - dimensional hypercubic lattice ,",
    "the results reported in literature are briefly summarized as follows . in both 1d and 2d , in agreement with exact results , there is no lro at any finite temperature .",
    "however , sro persists until a certain temperature is exceeded  @xcite . in 3d , lro is stable at low temperature , and there is a continuous phase transition into the sro state at some critical temperature . within schwinger boson mft ( sbmft ) , the order - disorder transition has the usual mean field exponents  @xcite .    in this paper , we re - examine the sbmft for the heisenberg spin hamiltonian on the 3d cubic lattice .",
    "we find that , provided the spin @xmath2 is greater than some critical value @xmath3 @xmath4 the previously reported mean field solution that exhibits a continuous phase transition for magnetic lro is actually an unstable solution corresponding to a local _ maximum _ of the free energy .",
    "instead , the minimum free energy solution shows a first order transition .",
    "since it is well established that the heisenberg hamiltonian has a continuous transition in 3d , our analysis raises serious question about the applicability of the sbmft in 3d .",
    "furthermore , the first order transition is into a state with zero mean field amplitude , i.e. , without any correlation .",
    "thus , the supposed advantage of sbmft of being able to describe sro does not actually exist .",
    "these pathologies of the sbmft are not restricted to 3d , but should appear whenever the lro can be destroyed by tuning some parameter .",
    "an example of which is the bilayered heisenberg antiferromagnet at @xmath5 where as the inter - layer coupling is increased , sbmft also shows a first order transition into the uncorrelated state  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section ii and iii",
    ", we will discuss the sbmft solutions for the heisenberg ferromagnet and antiferromagnet separately , showing that the same pathologies are seen in both cases .",
    "these results will be summarized in section iv , where we will also discuss their relevance to the bilayered heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "in this section we discuss the sbmft for the fm heisenberg model .",
    "we first briefly review the schwinger boson representation and its mean field equations  @xcite .",
    "we then discuss the mean field solutions of the model with emphasis on 3d .",
    "we study a spin - s heisenberg ferromagnet in a d - dimensional hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions ,    @xmath6    where the exchange constant @xmath7 and the sum is over all the nearest - neighbor pairs on the lattice . in the schwinger boson representation ,",
    "a spin operator is represented by two types of bosons ,    @xmath8    @xmath9    these bosons should satisfy the constraints in their fock space as follows , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 for physical systems . by introducing a bond operator , @xmath12 , the su(2 ) fm heisenberg hamiltonian can be written as , @xmath13    in the above eqn .",
    ", @xmath14 denotes a normal ordering of the bosonic operators , n is the number of sites in the lattice , and @xmath15 is the nearest neighbor coordinate",
    ". a lagrangian multiplier field @xmath16 for the constraint on site @xmath17 is introduced .",
    "note that the fm heisenberg model is now transformed to an interacting boson model .    to proceed further ,",
    "a bond mean field amplitude @xmath18 , assumed to be real and uniform , is introduced . neglecting fluctuations ,",
    "the following non - interacting mean field hamiltonian is obtained .",
    ",    @xmath19    in @xmath20 the local constraint at every site is replaced by a global one , and a non - zero value of b indicates _ short - range _ spin - spin correlation .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian can be diagonalized , and we obtain    @xmath21    where the energy dispersion is given by @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , and @xmath24    the free energy per site is then given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the boltzmann constant and @xmath28 the temperature .",
    "the amplitudes of the mean fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 are obtained by minimizing the free energy , which leads to two coupled mean field eqns .",
    ",    @xmath31    @xmath32    where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 acts as an effective temperature . in these eqns .",
    ", @xmath35 may be viewed as an effective chemical potential . since @xmath36 , we have @xmath37 .",
    "magnetic long range order corresponds to schwinger boson condensation at @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "since bosons do not condense at finite temperature in 1d or 2d , the 1d model and the 2d model are disordered at any temperature . in three and higher dimensions ,",
    "one expects a finite critical temperature @xmath39 , below which sbmft gives a magnetic ordered state .    to study the possible magnetically ordered phase , the schwinger boson condensate density @xmath40 is introduced , and the coupled mean field eqns .",
    "are rewritten as ,    @xmath41    @xmath42    in the bose condensed state , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ; in the disordered state , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "sarker et al .",
    "@xcite determined the critical temperature by requiring @xmath44 and @xmath46 .",
    "this transition point will be labeled as @xmath48 , with the effective temperature @xmath49 . by expanding equations 10 and 11 about @xmath49 , the transition was determined to be continuous with mean field exponents . upon re - examination of the mean field equations , we have , however , found the transition point @xmath49 to be physically inaccessible if the spin @xmath2 is greater than some @xmath50 . to understand this",
    ", we note that these equations are well - behaved in term of @xmath51 .",
    "for example , the quantity @xmath29 is smooth and monotomically decreasing as @xmath51 increases as one would expect .",
    "this is shown in fig . 1 for the case of @xmath52 .",
    "at @xmath53 , @xmath29 is finite , and @xmath44 . as @xmath51 increases",
    ", @xmath29 decreases monotonously . for @xmath54",
    ", the state is disordered with @xmath55 ; and at @xmath56 , the state is ordered with @xmath43 .",
    "on the other hand , the physical temperature @xmath57 , and since @xmath29 decreases with increasing with @xmath51 , it is possible for @xmath28 to decrease as @xmath51 increases .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "this would mean for example that @xmath29 would increase with increasing @xmath28 , which is physically nonsensical .",
    "if the second order transition point @xmath49 belongs to such an unphysical @xmath51 , it will not be accessible .    in ref.2",
    ", it was implicitly assumed that the mean field eqns . 9 and 10",
    "have a two branch structure , so that at high @xmath28 , @xmath58 is the only solution , but below some @xmath59 , a second solution with @xmath45 appears . instead , mean field eqns . actually have three branches of solutions for @xmath29 or @xmath51 as functions of @xmath28 .",
    "one is the trivial solution ( upper branch ) , @xmath58 , or @xmath60 at all @xmath28 .",
    "the second branch solutions ( lower branch ) exist for all @xmath61 , with @xmath51 monotomically increasing with @xmath28 . for @xmath62",
    ", there is yet a third branch of solutions ( middle branch ) , where @xmath63 goes to @xmath64 at @xmath65 and decreases as @xmath28 increases until it merges and terminates with the second branch at @xmath66 .",
    "the solutions to the mean field equations correspond to extrema of the free energy . for @xmath67",
    "there are more than one solutions , and the one giving the lowest free energy should be chosen . from the structure of the @xmath68 vs. @xmath28 curve , we can deduce that as @xmath28 is reduced , the free energy functional should behave as follows . for @xmath69 there is only one extremum , which is at @xmath70 between @xmath71 and @xmath72 where there are three solutions , there is a local minimum at @xmath73 a local maximum at @xmath74 ( middle branch ) and a secondary local minimum at @xmath75 ( lower branch ) , with @xmath76 as @xmath28 decreases in the regime , @xmath77 moves towards @xmath78 and at @xmath79 the curvature at @xmath58 changes sign and becomes a local maximum below @xmath80 leaving @xmath81 as the only minimum . given this , at some temperature @xmath82 between @xmath83 and @xmath84 the free energy at @xmath81",
    "will become lower than at @xmath70 thus , at @xmath85 @xmath29 will take a jump from @xmath78 to a finite value of @xmath86 in figs .",
    "3 - 5 , we show plots of free energy @xmath87 vs. @xmath29 to illustrate the above . in these plots , the @xmath88 is calculated by solving eq .",
    "10 for @xmath89 with @xmath29 as a variable and then evaluating @xmath87 in eq .",
    "thus , we see that in general , sbmft gives a first order transition in @xmath90 since @xmath29 is a measure of the short range order , the transition in @xmath29 is fictitious and whether it is first order or continuous is not of any real significance .",
    "more importantly is where the bose condensation transition occurs relative to this transition .",
    "since in terms of @xmath91 eq .",
    "10 is just that for bose - einstein condensation ,  @xmath92 for @xmath93 , as @xmath94 and hence so does the physical temperature @xmath95 .",
    "thus for small @xmath96 bose condensation occurs at a temperature where the lowest branch is the stable solution , and the continuous transition at @xmath97 accessible within sbmft .",
    "as @xmath2 increases , however , @xmath97 continues to increase and for @xmath98 @xmath99 where the solution at the lower branch becomes meta - stable . at even larger @xmath2 ( e.g. @xmath52 )",
    ", @xmath97 becomes @xmath100 and the solution becomes unstable .",
    "either way , for @xmath101 as the temperature increases from zero , the system undergoes a discontinuous transition at @xmath82 from the lro state with finite condensate density to the uncorrelated state with @xmath70 there are two problems with this .",
    "the first is that result of a first order transition in magnetic long range order for the heisenberg model in 3d is wrong .",
    "the second is that one of the major advantages of sbmft is supposedly its applicability to both lro and sro state .",
    "but in fact , the stable solution is either completely uncorrelated or has lro , just like standard bethe - weiss mft .",
    "in this section , we discuss the sbmft for the afm heisenberg model described by the hamiltonian ,    @xmath102    where @xmath7 , and all other notations are the same as in the previous section for the fm case .",
    "we find that the same pathologies in the sbmft solution for fm model are present also in the afm model .",
    "the hypercubic lattice is divided into two sub - lattices _ a _ and _ b_. in a nearest neighbor pair @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . as in the fm model , two schwinger bosons @xmath106 with @xmath107 , at each site @xmath17 , and a bond field @xmath108 are introduced .",
    "@xmath109 is anti - symmetric with respect to the interchange of @xmath17 and @xmath110 .",
    "a spin rotation by @xmath111 about the y - axis is made at all the sites @xmath110 on the sub - lattice _",

    "is then transformed as @xmath114 .",

    "are introduced .",
    "@xmath118 describes short - range afm correlations .",
    "after some algebra , the mean field hamiltonian can be written as :    @xmath119    with @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",

    "the mean field eqns .",
    "become ,    @xmath130    @xmath131    we now discuss the solutions of these eqns .",
    "note that @xmath132 , so we have @xmath133 .",
    "similar to the fm case , @xmath46 and @xmath134 in the disordered phase , and @xmath43 and @xmath135 in the schwinger boson condensation state , which corresponds to the neel ordering phase of the spin system .",
    "the results are very similar to those for the 3d fm model .    the solutions for the mean field equations are smooth and monotonic functions of the effective temperature @xmath51 , but not of the physical temperature @xmath28 .",
    "in fig . 6 , we show the calculated @xmath51 as a function of @xmath28 from the mean field eqns . for a typical spin @xmath52 .",
    "there are three branches of solutions in @xmath51 . the @xmath136 branch , and a middle and a lower branches .",
    "the bose condensation point @xmath48 ( where @xmath137 and @xmath55 ) is again on the upper branch corresponding to a maximum in the free energy .",
    "we have calculated the free energy and found that the stable mean field solution jumps from a high @xmath28 phase in the @xmath136 branch to a low @xmath28 phase in the lower branch with a finite condensation density at a temperature @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , the transition for lro is first order .",
    "the qualitative feature of the free energy as a function of @xmath124 is similar to those in fig .",
    "3 - 5 for the fm case .",
    "the critical spin for which @xmath139 for the afm model is found to be @xmath140 , larger than that in the fm model , but still substantially smaller than @xmath141 . for @xmath142",
    "the ordering transition within sbmft is first order and for @xmath143 , the transition is second order .",
    "we have re - examined the schwinger boson mft for quantum spin systems and found that for both the fm and afm heisenberg hamiltonian , the mean field equations possess in general three branches of solutions in the intermediate temperature regime . as a consequence ,",
    "the system in 3d undergoes a first order transition from the ordered state to the completely uncorrelated state unless the spin @xmath2 is very small .",
    "in addition to erroneously predicting a first order transition in magnetic ordering , there is no stable solution with finite sro without lro , the existence of which is supposed to be one of the advantages of sbmft over bethe - weiss mft or spin wave theory .",
    "the three branch structure of the mean field solutions is not restricted to 3d .",
    "it is the origin of the reported discontinuous jump in the short - range mf amplitude @xmath124 for the heisenberg afm on 2d square lattice as the temperature is increased  @xcite . for the 2d square lattice , however , the effective temperature for bose condensation @xmath144 which means @xmath145 for all @xmath146 as a result , sbmft is capable in that case of describing the sro state at low temperature .",
    "it should not be assumed though that the pathologies associated with sbmft reported in this paper is only relevant for @xmath147 in fact , it will apply whenever the lro state is destroyed by tuning some parameter if that parameter is sufficiently large .",
    "one example of this is the bilayered heisenberg afm hamiltonian in 2d , which received interest a few years ago due to its relevance to ybco  @xcite . in the bilayered system ,",
    "the in - plane af magnetic lro is destroyed by sufficiently large inter - layer coupling which favors having inter - plane neighbors forming singlets  @xcite . using sbmft , ng et al  @xcite found for @xmath148 ,",
    "the transition is first order from finite condensate density to the state of disconnected inter - plane singlets with zero in - plane correlations .",
    "this result contradicted the hypothesis that the 2d bilayered afm at @xmath5 is in the same universality class as the 3d non - linear sigma model at finite @xmath28 , a hypothesis partially confirmed by finite sized numerical calculations for @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that sbmft is qualitatively correct , but that the value of @xmath3 calculated is too small .",
    "subsequently , gelfand et al  @xcite provided further evidence that the transition for arbitrary @xmath2 is continuous and that the sbmft prediction of first order transition is incorrect .",
    "however , it was not clear why sbmft gave such a qualitatively incorrect result . from the present work , we can now understand that the first order transition reported there is an artifact of the same pathologies of the sbmft reported in this paper .    finally , while we have focused on su(2 ) heisenberg hamiltonian in this paper , the results are a consequence of the structure of the mean field equations , and therefore will be valid for su(n ) generalization of the heisenberg hamiltonian for which the sbmft approach above  @xcite can be applied .",
