    "the crypt of the large intestine is a widely used model for studying the division of stem cells , for observing the differentiation and , ultimately , death of cells arising from those stem cells , and for the genesis of tumors resulting from abnormalities of cell division and/or death and/or migration .",
    "we have previously set up simple models of cell birth , differentiation and death in the colonic crypt and used these to analyze parameters of cell behavior which led to stable equilibria and to tumorigenesis if those parameters were altered .",
    "our results showed that the classical exponential growth of an expanding tumor clone could occur , but that mutations with weaker effects , particularly on programmed cell death ( pcd ) , could cause tumor growth to a new equilibrium or plateau level of cells .",
    "we speculated that such a form of tumor growth might be particularly applicable to benign lesions which rarely progress to malignancy , such as hyperplastic polyps of the colorectum , or lipomas of the skin .    the model which we originally described was based on a commonly used simplification of the cell populations within the colonic crypt ( see table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "a population of stem cells ( number @xmath2 at generation @xmath3 ) was assumed to replicate at a specified rate ( division time @xmath4 ) .",
    "each stem cell underwent pcd with probability @xmath5 , renewed itself with probability @xmath6 , or progressed to a state of semi - differentiation ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "usually , @xmath2 was assumed to be constant , with @xmath6 set to 0.5 . for the population of semi - differentiated cells ( the size of which at generation @xmath3-th",
    "will be indicated as @xmath8 ) , division could lead to pcd , renewal or progression to a fully differentiated state ( the size of which at generation @xmath3-th will be indicated as @xmath9 ) .",
    "fully differentiated cells underwent pcd with a probability @xmath10 .",
    "mathematically , following the above assumptions , the dynamics of the cell population was ruled by the linear equations : @xmath11 where , of course : @xmath12 and @xmath13 . if we assume that @xmath2 is constant , it has to be that @xmath14 and the first equation reads @xmath15 .",
    "when @xmath16 the number of semi - differentiated cells evolves to the following equilibrium value @xmath17 , with @xmath18 proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "instead when @xmath19 there is an exponential increase @xmath20 as @xmath21 . therefore , @xmath22 is a bifurcation parameter @xcite , that is , there exists a critical value @xmath23 such that the behavior of the system for @xmath24 ( that is , @xmath25 ) is not equivalent to the behavior for @xmath26 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath6 is also a bifurcation parameter .",
    "note , however , that if @xmath27 , the constant number of stem cells and the rate of progression to a semi - differentiated state are not bifurcation parameters .",
    "if they have a small variations , the behavior of @xmath8 does not change qualitatively and has only a small numerical variation .    in this manuscript",
    ", we extend our model to include situations in which there is random fluctuation in cell numbers within each compartment and to situations in which the probabilities of pcd , differentiation or renewal depend on the number of cells in each compartment .",
    "incorporating these assumptions introduces non - linearity into the model , with consequences for the maintenance of stable equilibria within the crypt cell populations .",
    "let us assume that some function of the number of semi - differentiated cells may increase or reduce the probability of pcd .",
    "in the former case , the system has , as in the linear model , only one global asymptotic equilibrium @xmath18 . as a consequence ,",
    "the parameter @xmath28 is a decreasing function of @xmath29 , and it may be seen that @xmath18 is smaller than the value @xmath30 which would be reached if @xmath22 were constant . this situation may represent normal homeostasis .",
    "in contrast , let us consider the latter case , which represents an abnormal situation , perhaps one which results from mutation in the stem cell compartment . in the latter case , we shall allow @xmath31 to be a decreasing function of @xmath29 , whereas we will consider , @xmath32 constant or slowly growing , so that @xmath33 is a growing function of the number of semi - differentiated cells .",
    "furthermore we consider that for low @xmath29 the variation of that function is slow , such that it initially is approximately constant . because of their nature @xmath34 and therefore these parameters shall have asymptotic values , as in figure [ betaplots ] . in practice",
    "the @xmath35 functions model a sort of loose threshold mechanism .",
    "we do not place a particular constraint on the analytical form of these functions , since the results which we shall present are qualitatively dependent only on the `` shape '' of @xmath33 .",
    "for the simulations which we shall propose we shall use : @xmath36 or@xmath37 thus instead of the linear set of equations ( [ modlin ] ) we have the following nonlinear discrete dynamical system : @xmath38 note that the behavior of @xmath39 , being @xmath40 , is determined by the behavior of @xmath8 :    * when @xmath20 also @xmath41 ; * when @xmath42 also @xmath43 tends to an equilibrium point .",
    "therefore , in the next section , we shall deal only with the dynamics of @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "in this section we shall set @xmath45 and consider it as a static parameter in the input to the equation for the semi - differentiated cells .",
    "the equilibrium equation reads @xmath46 which we shall rearrange in the more convenient form : @xmath47 that is , the equilibrium is determined by the intersection of the @xmath48 curve with the family of hyperbolae @xmath49 .",
    "the dynamics of the model are essentially determined by the asymptotic value @xmath50 .      here",
    "@xmath51 as a consequence , there exists ( see figure [ saddlenodebeta ] ) a threshold value @xmath52 for @xmath53 , such that for each @xmath54 there are two points of intersection , ( that is , two equilibria ) ; for @xmath55 , the lines collide , and for @xmath56 there are no equilibrium points . in the limit case",
    "@xmath55 there is tangency ( a double equilibrium point ) . the higher the value of @xmath53 , the more to the right are the hyperbolae . from a static point of view ( that is , considering different but constant values of @xmath53 )",
    ", there is a saddle node bifurcation @xcite . from figure [ saddlenodeandplots]-(a ) , we see that for @xmath57 , there is a stable lower equilibrium @xmath58 , followed by an unstable equilibrium @xmath59 ; the equilibria tend to collide for @xmath60 .",
    "the point @xmath58 has an attraction basin equal to the whole range @xmath61 , which is easily verified by using the following liapunov - la salle function @xmath62 . for all @xmath63 , there is instability and unbounded growth of the number of semi - differentiated cells ( @xmath64 ) . from figure [ saddlenodeandplots ] , the critical threshold value corresponds to the maximum of the curve @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 . as a consequence @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the unique real solution of the null derivative equation @xmath70 from figures [ saddlenodebeta ] and [ saddlenodeandplots]-(a )",
    ", it is evident that the first , stable equilibrium point is proportional to @xmath53 for small and also `` moderately small '' values of this parameter , since the first intersection between the hyperbola @xmath71 and the curve @xmath72 is located in the a zone in which the second curve is approximately constant .",
    "let us simulate what happens in the proximity of the bifurcation value @xmath52 .",
    "figure [ saddlenodeandplots]-(b ) shows a simulation of a system having @xmath73 slightly lower than @xmath74 .",
    "it shows classical behavior , initial growth followed by a plateau .",
    "there is no qualitative difference between this behavior and that shown in figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "a more interesting situation is shown in figure [ saddlenodeandplots]-(c ) , in which @xmath53 is slightly greater than @xmath52 and in which the plateau is only temporary , since it is followed by an exponential `` explosion '' .",
    "a small positive variation around @xmath52 , therefore , makes the system grow without bound .",
    "we have analyzed the bifurcation of the growth in cell numbers from a static point of view , for given values of the parameter @xmath53 , that is , for given values of the number of stem cells and of the rate of progression from stem cell to semi - differentiated cell . in reality , the bifurcation may be driven by dynamic phenomena , such as variation - even if transient - in the number of stem cells . the rate of pcd or the rate of progression to semi - differentiated cells may also vary .",
    "we shall simulate such variability by means of the following non - linear , stochastic , discrete dynamic system , using the original model @xmath75 except that @xmath76 and @xmath77 are now stochastic processes .",
    "first , we simulated a sporadic random increase in the number of stem cells near the bifurcation by considering a constant @xmath44 such that @xmath78 that is , @xmath53 is slightly under the bifurcation value . we assume a stochastically varying @xmath6 , which will follow this rule : @xmath79 $ } .",
    "\\end{cases}\\]]with @xmath80,@xmath81 and @xmath82 random variables and such that @xmath83 .",
    "the result patterns are identical ( exponential growth ) in each simulation , but with different start - points for the exponential explosion in growth . therefore , this model seems to indicate that , since the exponential growth may be due to saddle - node bifurcations ( from a steady state to an unbounded growth ) and since these phenomena may be driven by a small noise , the initial time in which this growth ( for example , that of a tumor ) starts is not calculable in a deterministic way .",
    "we also undertook different stochastic simulations , in which we assumed that @xmath84 , @xmath85 are gaussian or uniform random variables with @xmath86 = 0.5 $ ] .",
    "the standard deviation was variable and such that for a finite number of generations @xmath87 is significantly greater than @xmath88 .",
    "the mean values of parameters are such that , if the system were deterministic , it would have a plateau ( that is , @xmath89 < u_m$ ] )",
    ". the simulations showed that all outcomes do not result in exponential explosion in a given finite temporal window .",
    "intuitively , this means that the random effects do not sufficiently scramble the system to drive it into the zone of instability .",
    "more formally , given the stochastic process @xmath90 , there is exponential growth only if , at the generation @xmath3 when @xmath91 assumes its minimum value @xmath92 , the number @xmath93 of semi - differentiated cells is such that @xmath94 .",
    "we performed stochastic simulations for various mean values of @xmath53 such that @xmath89 < u_m$ ] , constant @xmath44 and each @xmath76 gaussian with mean 0.5 and @xmath95 ( which implies that @xmath96=2 \\alpha_2 x_0 $ ] ) .",
    "the simulations showed that also for low values of @xmath96 $ ] there may be exponential explosion in a fixed number of generations ( for ex . 100 ) and that for @xmath97 there is exponential explosion in all cases .",
    "the possible behaviors with random variations of @xmath53 can be summarized as follows :    * if @xmath98 increases in a random generation @xmath3 to an upper value @xmath99 , the system loses its equilibrium and exponential growth starts ; * if @xmath53 varies randomly in a range @xmath100 $ ] , with @xmath101 , there is no loss of equilibrium ; * if @xmath53 varies randomly for a finite number of generations in a range @xmath100 $ ] , with @xmath102 , there may or may not be loss of equilibrium ; * if @xmath53 varies randomly and permanently in a range @xmath103 $ ] , with @xmath104 and @xmath105=u_o \\ge u_m$ ] , there is loss of equilibrium in the long run ; * if @xmath53 varies randomly and permanently in a range @xmath103 $ ] , with @xmath104 and @xmath106 , we may find an @xmath107 such that if @xmath108 there is loss of equilibrium in the long run , whereas if @xmath109 , @xmath110 remains bounded .      here : @xmath111 as a consequence , as shown in figure [ hystbeta ] , for increasing values of @xmath53 the system passes from @xmath112 to @xmath113 and back to @xmath112 equilibrium points .",
    "this is a typical situation which leads to a hysteresis bifurcation diagram [ 4 ] , as in figure [ hysteresis]-(a ) .",
    "it is possible to determine @xmath114 particular values for @xmath53 , let us call them @xmath115 and @xmath52 with @xmath116 , such that :    * for @xmath117 there is one globally asymptotically stable equilibrium , @xmath118 ; * for @xmath119 there is one globally asymptotically stable equilibrium , @xmath120 ; * for @xmath121 there are three coexisting equilibria : a new third unstable equilibrium @xmath122 ( with : @xmath123 ) ; and the two previous equilibria : @xmath118 ( with basin of attraction now : @xmath124 ) and @xmath125 ( with basin of attraction : @xmath126 ) .",
    "the above stated stability properties are easily proved by using these two liapounov - la salle functions : @xmath127 and @xmath128 .    with reference to the bifurcation diagram ,",
    "@xmath115 and @xmath52 correspond , respectively , to the minimum and maximum of the bifurcation curve @xmath65 . in this case , if we call @xmath129 and @xmath130 ( with @xmath131 ) the two solutions of the equation @xmath132 , we obtain @xmath133 by using the terminology of catastrophe theory , when @xmath53 varies and become the greater ( lower ) than the value of @xmath52 ( @xmath115 ) , there is an elementary catastrophe , ( that is , with an infinitesimal variation of a control parameter , @xmath53 in our case , there is a finite variation in the equilibrium point ) . in figure [ hysteresis ] ,",
    "the effect of the hysteresis bifurcation on cell numbers is shown by means of two simulations : in particular in figure [ hysteresis]-(b ) , corresponding to a value of @xmath53 slightly greater than @xmath52 , the system appears to have reached its equilibrium , but restarts , increasing to reach a new and higher asymptotic value .",
    "furthermore , in the case in which the deterministic model has two , co - existing , alternative , stable equilibria , the effect of stochastic variation of parameters is a catastrophic noise - induced transition @xcite from a lower ( upper ) to an upper ( lower ) equilibrium point ( figure [ hysteresis ] ) .",
    "let us suppose constant @xmath44 and stochastically varying @xmath6 in a way such that @xmath134$],@xmath104 .",
    "as @xmath135 , the system will have the following behaviors :    * if @xmath136 , then the asymptotic value @xmath110 will be a random variable with a probability density @xmath137 ( where we stress the dependence of the density on the parameter @xmath138 ) having a maximum corresponding to a low equilibrium point as in figure [ histograms]-(a ) ; * if @xmath139 and @xmath140 we have a @xmath141 such that its maximum is near to an upper equilibrium point .",
    "* when @xmath142 , we may find an @xmath143 such that if @xmath144 the above density remains unchanged , whereas if @xmath108 the above probability density @xmath141 changes , since its maximum is now near to an upper equilibrium point , as in figure [ histograms]-(b ) .",
    "this changing in the probability density distribution of @xmath145 ( as well as the change in the behaviors summarized at the end of section [ random fluctuation in cell numbers ] ) has been called noise - induced transition @xcite or , in recent literature , stochastic bifurcation @xcite . from a computational point of view , in practice we approximate @xmath146 with the probability density distribution of a @xmath8 with @xmath147 .",
    "it results that the nearer @xmath148 is to @xmath149 , the greater the value of @xmath3 which has to be chosen . on the contrary",
    "if one establishes a priori a finite number of generations @xmath150 , there are two values @xmath151 and @xmath152 such that if @xmath153 the probability density of @xmath154 has a low peak , if @xmath155 it has an high peak and if @xmath156 it has two peaks : one low and one high .",
    "remaining in the framework of increasing @xmath157 , there may be the theoretical possibility to have more complex configurations .",
    "in fact , if @xmath157 has @xmath158 inflexion points and if it is @xmath159 , there may be @xmath160 stable equilibria and @xmath161 unstable equilibria ( in alternated sequence starting from a stable equilibrium : stable , unstable , stable , unstable , etc@xmath162 ) .",
    "proceeding as in the sections [ exc ] and [ noexc ] , it is easy to show that there are @xmath163 hysteresis bifurcations followed by a final saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "thus also in this more complex case , it is possible to find a threshold value @xmath52 exceeding which there is exponential explosion .",
    "when @xmath164 , there may be @xmath165 stable equilibria and @xmath161 unstable equilibria , and @xmath161 hysteresis bifurcations .",
    "summarizing , also in these more complex case , the biological findings previously illustrated do not change , since the behavior is simply a mix of the behaviors illustrated in the two previous subsections .",
    "the first natural extension to the proposed nonlinear model is to consider that both semi - differentiated and fully differentiated cells may contribute to the variability in pcd .",
    "therefore we have @xmath166 with : @xmath167 for example , by assuming that there is no difference in the contribution of the semi - differentiated and fully differentiated cells , a natural candidate function is @xmath168 where @xmath169 is a function shaped as the one in figure [ betaplots ] ( different contribution may be modeled by assigning to @xmath29 and @xmath43 two different positive weights : @xmath170 , e.g. @xmath171 and @xmath172 i.e. dependence only on the fully differentiated cells ) .",
    "the following model results @xmath173 note that : @xmath174 that is , mathematically , the system may be classified as cooperative , in agreement with what we suggested biologically . defining the new variable : @xmath175 ( note that @xmath176 it is such that @xmath177 and @xmath178 ) and summing the third and the second equation of ( [ modnonlcoop ] ) we obtain ( for constant @xmath179 ) : @xmath180 whose equilibrium points are determined by the equation @xmath181 which is very similar to equation ( [ bife ] ) and which leads to the same bifurcation curves .",
    "simulations did not show a qualitative difference between non - cooperation and cooperation . from a quantitative point of view , on the contrary , there are differences : the dynamics are faster in the co - operative model , in agreement with the fact that @xmath22 depends on the sum @xmath182 .",
    "if we suppose that the parameters do not depend directly on @xmath29 , but that they depend , for example , on the ratio : @xmath183 we obtain , because of the constance of the @xmath2 , similar results as far as concerns the bifurcation diagrams .",
    "in fact , if we define the new variable : @xmath184 we may write the equilibrium equation in the form : @xmath185 the only difference in this case being that the bifurcation parameter is no longer @xmath186 , but is now the parameter @xmath44 alone . as consequence of ( [ ratio1 ] ) ,",
    "the equilibrium value is proportional to @xmath187 .",
    "again the same bifurcation diagram holds also by proposing a dependence on the following ratio : @xmath188 the equilibrium equation may be written as : @xmath189 which leads to the same bifurcation diagram because of the geometrical properties of the function @xmath190 and @xmath22 .",
    "we have presented a development of our model of cell birth , differentiation and death in the colonic crypt , which was used as a model for tumorigenesis .",
    "our previous model , which was linear , showed that failure of pcd - for example , in tumorigenesis - could lead either to exponential growth in cell numbers or to growth to some plateau .",
    "we note here that , remaining in the linear framework , some biological noteworthy modifications are possible . in particular : periodic or random changes of the parameters , in order to take into the account interactions with the microenvironment ; and , as suggested by one of the referees , incorporating exponential decay in the growth parameter , as in the gompertz model @xcite . this second point , in particular , would deserve a further analysis , also in the non - linear case . +",
    "our new models have incorporated realistic fluctuation in the parameters of the model and have introduced non - linearity by assuming dependence of parameters on the numbers of cells in each state of differentiation , perhaps as a result of a mutation occurring in and spreading through the stem cell population .",
    "furthermore , recently in @xcite it has been proposed for cancer cells a mechanism of self organization through cell to cell communication similar to the quorum sensing of bacteria , and other kind of cell - density dependence of apoptosis has been proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our new models are characterized by bifurcation between increase in cell numbers to stable equilibrium or explosive exponential growth , although , in particular cases , two coexisting stable equilibria exist together with an unstable equilibrium ( see sect . [ exc ] ) .",
    "moreover , we note here that for more complex ( but increasing ) shapes of @xmath157 , there may be even other coexisting equilibria .",
    "however , it is easy to show that these more complex ( and quite theoretical ) configurations of equilibria do not alter the biological findings of the present work .",
    "+ if we assume fluctuation in cell numbers undergoing pcd ( whether determined or random ) , the incorporation of non - linearity into the model generally makes exponential growth of a tumor more likely , as long as ( for random fluctuation ) , the number ( or the proportion ) of cells progressing from a stem cell to a semi - differentiated state exceeds a certain critical value for a sufficiently long period of time . in",
    "most - but not all - cases , once exponential growth has started , this process is irreversible . in some circumstances ,",
    "exponential growth may be preceded by a long plateau phase , mimicking equilibrium , of variable duration : thus apparently self - limiting lesions may not be so in practice and the duration of growth of a tumor may be impossible to predict on the basis of its size .",
    "our results show that the consequences of failure of pcd are complex and difficult to predict .",
    "progression of a tumor is not necessarily caused by acquiring additional extra genetic or epigenetic changes , but may simply be a consequence of normal alterations in cell turnover or fluctuations in numbers , owing to , for example , tissue damage .",
    "apparent regression of tumors may occur similarly . while failure of pcd is more likely than simple increased cell replication to be associated with benign , generally non - progressing tumors , the exponential growth observed suggests that pcd failure is potentially a general mechanism of carcinogenesis .",
