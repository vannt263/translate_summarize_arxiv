    "quantum correlation not only is the key to our understanding of quantum world but also is essential for the powerful applications of quantum information and quantum computation .",
    "entanglement lies at the heart of this field @xcite but it does not account for all possible quantum correlations contained in a bipartite system .",
    "there are quantum correlations beyond entanglement , such as qd @xcite , min @xcite , measurement - induced disturbance ( mid ) @xcite and measure of nonclassical correlation in coherence - vector representation @xcite , etc .",
    "qd has been proposed as the resource in quantum computation @xcite and the gaussian qd has beeen applied to quantum key distribution @xcite .",
    "it is indicated in @xcite that min may be useful in quantum cryptography , general quantum dense coding @xcite , remote state control @xcite , etc .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , qd , mid and min are established by local measurement .",
    "in addition , the use of averaged quantity in identifying quantum correlation has been used for instance in quantifying entanglement for multipartite quantum systems @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new quantum correlation measured by the averaged quantity based on local von neumann measurements from a different point of view .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give the definition of our quantum correlation .",
    "then section 3 discusses the nullity of the our measure , it is showen that all quantum states except the product one contain this kind of quantum correlation ( theorem 1 ) .",
    "some numerical results are given in section 4 ( propositions 2 - 4 ) , and in section 5 , three examples , i.e. , the bell - diagonal state , the werner state and the isotropic state are proposed and we compare our measure with qd and eof through the werner state and the isotropic state . at last",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "let @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 be the state space of the bipartite system a+b .",
    "we now define @xmath4 where @xmath5 stands for the hilbert - schmidt norm ( that is , @xmath6^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] ) , the supremum is taken over all local von neumann measurements @xmath7 ( on the subsystem a ) , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the reduced state of @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the identity map on part b.    @xmath13 denotes the maximum ` mean distance ' between the local state @xmath14 and the output local states @xmath15 with respect to the local measurement element @xmath16 .",
    "this quantity can be measured only by local part after the local von neumann measurements of another part .",
    "@xmath17 means that if part a performs a measurement , then the local state of part b will change .",
    "therefore @xmath18 define a quantum correlation since it can not occurs in the classical world . by the definition ,",
    "it is obvious that @xmath18 is invariant under local unitary operation , i.e. , @xmath19 holds for any unitary operator @xmath20 ( resp .",
