    "among the many virtues of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , one of the most important is that in spite of its proximity , for most purposes its stars may be considered to lie at a single distance . as a result",
    ", the lmc is frequently used in studies of stellar evolution , is of primary importance in the calibration of the distance scale , and is the target of several projects aimed at detecting microlensing events in the galactic halo ( e.g. alcock et al .",
    "2000 , lasserre et al .  2000 , udalski et al .  1999 ,",
    "drake et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the neighboring small magellanic cloud ( smc ) has never reached the same level of popularity , for the interesting reason that it is stretched by several kpc along the line of sight ( e.g.  caldwell & coulson 1986 , hatzidimitriou & hawkins 1989 ) , the probable result of tidal interactions with the lmc and the milky way .",
    "probing deeper , we find that the stars of the lmc are not , after all , quite at the same distance , because the lmc disk is tilted with respect to the line of sight .",
    "the lmc s tilt has most recently been measured by van der marel & cioni ( 2001 ) , who found its value to be @xmath435  using asymptotic giant branch and red giant branch tip ( trgb ) stars observed in the 2mass survey ( skrutskie 1998 ) .",
    "the effect of the tilt is to produce a modulation of the apparent luminosity of these tracers with position angle in the lmc s disk , with an amplitude of @xmath40.2 magnitude peak - to - trough .",
    "moreover , upon deprojecting the 2mass data , van der marel ( 2001 ) found that the lmc disk is elliptical and has a nonuniform surface density distribution , indicative of tidal forces acting on the lmc .",
    "clearly , the lmc is not slipping through its interactions with the milky way and the smc completely unscathed .",
    "we are thus led to ask , what further evidence for the lmc - smc - milky way interaction may we find hidden in the lmc s geometry ?",
    "the question is important for chronicling the interaction history through numerical models ( e.g.  gardiner & noguchi 1996 ) , and may have implications for interpreting the microlensing results ( e.g.  zaritsky & lin 1997 , zhao & evans 2000 ) . in this paper , we report the results of our use of the apparent luminosity of `` red clump '' stars to measure the shape of the lmc disk . the red clump , which is composed of the younger , more metal - rich analogues to the core helium - burning horizontal branch stars found in globular clusters , has been widely discussed in the literature for use as a distance indicator ( e.g.  girardi & salaris 2001 , gs01 ; cole 1998 ) . while the red clump remains controversial as an absolute distance indicator , by using it to measure _ relative _ distances to lmc fields we avoid the disagreement over its zero point .",
    "red clump stars are more numerous than trgb stars by a factor of @xmath4100 and have tightly defined colors and magnitudes , making them easily identifiable in color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) . in the lmc",
    ", they have a typical surface density of 3.5@xmath5 stars per square degree , allowing us to search for structure with high spatial frequency . because they have well - defined mean colors in addition to magnitudes",
    ", we can measure reddenings with the same tracers used to measure distances , avoiding the population - dependent reddening effects discussed by zaritsky ( 1999 ) .",
    "the errors associated with using the red clump as a distance indicator are mainly systematic ones .",
    "we discuss their possible effect on our results in section 4 .",
    "we observed 50 fields in the lmc with the ctio 0.9-m telescope and site 2k@xmath62k ccd#3 camera during the nights 2001 november 1824 ( fig .",
    "we used ctio s johnson @xmath7 and kron - cousins @xmath8 filters .",
    "the fields were randomly selected from a 6@xmath66area of the lmc , with the constraint that they should lie far from regions of recent star formation , where we expect extinction by interstellar dust to be high .",
    "we used gain setting 2 , which provides gain of @xmath41.5 @xmath9/adu and read noise of @xmath43.5 @xmath9 .",
    "all of the nights were photometric , while the seeing was typically 115 .",
    "starting with our first field , our procedure was to take one pair of @xmath7 and @xmath8 exposures in one field before moving on to the next .",
    "once all fields had been observed once in @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we repeated the sequence twice . with 250 sec of exposure in @xmath7 and 200 sec in @xmath8 , we were able to achieve s / n@xmath10 at @xmath11 while observing @xmath12 fields per night . in all , we obtained 34 pairs of @xmath13 images per field , each observed on different nights .",
    "we observed landolt ( 1992 ) photometric standards at several times during each night for calculation of zero points , atmospheric extinctions , and color corrections .",
    "we also observed two standard star fields located near the position of the lmc , for which arlo landolt kindly provided standard magnitudes .",
    "these fields were used to check for different atmospheric extinction at the lmc s position compared to the celestial equator , for which we found no evidence .",
    "a byproduct of the fast quad amplifier readout used with the site 2k@xmath62k ccd is crosstalk between each amplifier and the other three , which produces faint ghosts in the images .",
    "our first image reduction step was to remove these ghosts by subtracting from each ccd section the proper fraction of the neighboring sections .",
    "following this crosstalk correction , we performed the standard image reduction steps of overscan subtraction , trimming , bias subtraction , and flat fielding with twilight sky flats , all done with the quadproc package in iraf .",
    "we performed photometry on each of the 304 individual reduced frames with daophot ( stetson 1987 ) and the accompanying profile - fitting program allstar . because finding isolated stars in the crowded lmc fields was difficult , we selected a large number ( @xmath4200 ) of stars per frame to define the point - spread function ( psf ) , allowing an average , quadratically variable psf to be constructed .",
    "we corrected the psf magnitudes to an aperture of diameter 15  by performing aperture photometry on the psf stars after subtracting all other stars , while for some stars allowing the magnitude to be extrapolated based on smaller apertures using the aperture growth curve measured using daogrow ( stetson 1990 ) .",
    "we measured only aperture magnitudes for the standard star frames , again using daogrow to extrapolate the measurements of some of the stars to a 15  aperture .",
    "we then calculated nightly zero points , atmospheric extinction coefficients , and color terms . after averaging the seven color term measurements , we recalculated the zero points and atmospheric extinctions while holding the color terms fixed .",
    "we applied these calibration equations to our lmc frames using the psf stars as local standards .",
    "table 1 shows the calibration coefficients of the transformation equations : @xmath14 @xmath15 where uppercase refers to standard magnitudes , lowercase to instrumental magnitudes , and @xmath16 is the airmass .",
    "each frame contains several thousand red clump stars , easily identified by their location in the cmd . after selecting stars within a box encompassing the red clump ( fig .",
    "2 ) , we fit a gaussian profile combined with a second order polynomial to the @xmath17 and @xmath8 histograms within the box , taking the gaussian means as the mean color and magnitude of the red clump stars .",
    "we used bin sizes corresponding approximately to the precision which we can measure the means , given the intrinsic @xmath17 and @xmath8 dispersions of the histograms and the number of red clump stars per frame .",
    "we filtered the histograms with a 2040 bin - wide savitzky - golay filter ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) before fitting , as we found that our fitting routine behaved more reliably with this step included .",
    "however , the @xmath18 values and likelihoods of the fits were calculated using the unfiltered histograms . on average , we found the fits to the @xmath17 histograms produced @xmath19=1.3 with @xmath420% chance of measuring higher @xmath18 purely by chance ; for the @xmath8 histograms the numbers were @xmath19=1.04 with @xmath435% probability for higher @xmath18 .",
    "next , we averaged the 34 measurements per field to produce an average red clump @xmath17 color and @xmath8 magnitude for each field . assuming an intrinsic red clump color of @xmath17=0.92",
    ", we calculated @xmath20 interstellar reddening values for each field and converted these to @xmath8-band interstellar extinctions through the equation @xmath21 ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) .",
    "we selected the intrinsic color so as to produce a median reddening equal to that measured by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for the lmc , but note that our choice has no effect on our results since we are using the red clump only to measure relative distances .",
    "our formal errors in measuring the mean color and magnitude of the red clumps are small , @xmath221% .",
    "we thus expect our distance errors to be dominated by the photometric calibration ( 1% ) and by error in assigning the correct reddening through the red clump color ( 2% ) .",
    "we expect that variations in the age and metallicity of the red clump from field to field will be @xmath42% ; however , we do not include this source in our budget of random distance errors , as it is likely to be correlated with position in the lmc .",
    "we discuss the sources of error in depth in section 4 .      for the purposes of this section ,",
    "we assume that the variation in the reddening - corrected , mean @xmath8 magnitudes of the red clump stars in our fields is produced purely by distance effects , so that we can study the lmc s geometry .",
    "first , we converted the celestial coordinates of our fields into planar coordinates following wesselink ( 1959 ) .",
    "second , we transformed the observed @xmath23 into distances relative to the center of the lmc , which we take to be 05@xmath2419@xmath25380 @xmath26692752 ( 2000.0 , precessed from 1950.0 ; de vaucouleurs & freeman 1973 ) .",
    "we note that our assumed origin has no effect on our study of the lmc s shape . finally , we corrected for the small geometric projection effect produced by our fixed vantage point .    a weighted least - squares fit of a plane to all of the data yields a disk inclination angle @xmath27 and position angle of the line of nodes @xmath28 , where we have used the convention of @xmath29 for a face - on disk and measured the position angle as the number of degrees east with respect to north .",
    "this measurement is in good agreement with e.g.  caldwell & coulson ( 1986 ) , who found @xmath30 and @xmath31 from their analysis of individual cepheid distances .",
    "however , there is a possible problem with the fit , as @xmath18 per degree of freedom is equal to 1.4 , with only a 2% chance of attaining @xmath18 as high as ours through chance alone .",
    "figure 3 ( right panel ) shows the lmc disk as viewed edge - on along our measured line of nodes .",
    "the tilt of the disk is strikingly well defined , particularly when compared to figure 6 of caldwell & coulson ( 1986 ) . however , the fields at the southwestern edge ( open circles ) fall systematically low compared to the fitted plane , by @xmath40.1 magnitudes in @xmath8 or 2.5 kpc in distance .",
    "if we remove these 15 fields ( labelled by diamonds in the left panel of figure 3 ) from the fit , we find instead @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this inclination value is in excellent agreement with the value @xmath32 measured by van der marel & cioni ( 2001 ) , although we disagree at the @xmath33 level with their position angle @xmath34 .",
    "the statistical likelihood of the fit is now excellent , with a 96% chance of producing @xmath18 values higher than our measured 0.62 per degree of freedom .",
    "indeed , the high likelihood of the fit suggests that we have overestimated the size of our error bars .",
    "fitting a plane to only the 15 southwestern fields which we removed above , we find @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with @xmath37 and 94% probability of producing higher @xmath18 by chance .",
    "thus , our data imply that the lmc disk is warped and that its line of nodes is twisted at the southwestern edge .",
    "as shown by fitting planes to both the 15 southwestern and 35 remaining fields , our analysis suggests that the disk of the lmc is warped and twisted .",
    "this result can perhaps explain the different tilts measured by caldwell & coulson ( 1986 ) and van der marel & cioni ( 2001 ) as being caused by differing contributions of the warp to their datasets .",
    "the area sampled by our observations is similar to that studied by caldwell & coulson ( 1986 ) , so that we expect similar results if we include all of our fields in the fit .",
    "moreover , van der marel & cioni ( 2001 ) find that the inclination of the lmc drops by @xmath410 degrees outside a radius of @xmath445 from the center .",
    "although our study suggests that the lmc s warp begins at a radius @xmath43from the center , van der marel & cioni ( 2001 ) surveyed a much larger area than we have , making a direct comparison with their study difficult .",
    "our finding that the lmc is warped depends , however , on our assumption that distance is the dominant effect producing the observed variation in red clump luminosity . in the following sections , we discuss the possible sources of systematic error .",
    "the stability of the derived photometric zero points and atmospheric extinction terms suggests that the photometric calibration is accurate to @xmath11% ( table 1 ) .",
    "a further check against systematic errors is provided by the fact that we observed every field on three different nights . in figure 4 , we plot @xmath17 and @xmath8 of the red clump for the 152 pairs of observations , having subtracted the mean clump @xmath17 and @xmath8 for each field . the nightly drift and",
    "scatter is smaller than 1% , ruling out calibration uncertainty as the cause of the apparent warp .",
    "if we have overestimated the reddening @xmath20 in the 15 southwestern fields by @xmath40.07 magnitudes compared to the other fields , then this could explain the effect we see in figure 3 .",
    "figure 5 , where we plot @xmath38 as derived from the color of the red clump versus the departure of the fields in @xmath8 from the plane with @xmath39 , is cause for suspicion .",
    "the southwestern fields have red clumps with systematically higher interstellar extinction compared to the other fields .",
    "moreover , the magnitude deviation from the plane is correlated with @xmath38 , such that if we have overestimated the reddening in the southwestern fields by more than a factor of two , then reddening could explain the supposed warp .",
    "we checked whether we have miscalculated the reddening by looking for differences in other evolutionary features in the color - magnitude diagrams of the fields .",
    "if the reddening values are wrong , the error should manifest itself as a difference in color between the red clump and the red giant branch and main sequence in the southwestern fields .",
    "after correcting for the reddening and red clump luminosity differences , we merged the photometry for the southwestern fields and the remaining fields separately .",
    "figure 6 shows the difference of the two - dimensional histograms of the cmds of the merged southwestern and other fields , after applying various shifts in @xmath17 to the southwestern fields .",
    "the overlay of the colors of the main sequence and red giant branch allow a @xmath40.010.02 magnitude error in @xmath20 , but not a difference as large as 0.07 magnitudes .",
    "we therefore rule out large reddening errors as the cause of the warp .",
    "if we have properly accounted for interstellar correction , then why is there a correlation between the magnitude deviation from the lmc plane and @xmath38 ?",
    "figure 7 offers a plausible explanation . the cobe / dirbe  iras / issa dust map ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) shows that the southwestern corner of the lmc is associated with a region of higher diffuse extinction , presumably due to galactic foreground dust , having @xmath40 . for comparison , we measured @xmath41 at the lmc s southwest edge .",
    "gs01 and cole ( 1998 ) have discussed the strong effect that age and metallicity have on the luminosity of red clump stars . in short ,",
    "metal - poor clumps are brighter than metal - rich ones , and younger clumps brighter than older ones . assuming a mean red clump age of @xmath44 gyr , appropriate for the lmc ( gs01 ) , and a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath42 ( pagel & tautvaisiene 1998 ) , @xmath43 of the red clump may be made brighter by 0.1 magnitude by either lowering [ fe / h ] by @xmath41 dex or by lowering the age by @xmath42 gyr ; @xmath43 could be made fainter by 0.1 magnitude by raising [ fe / h ] by 0.3 dex or by increasing the age by @xmath43 gyr ( gs01 ) .",
    "thus , we need to consider that the supposed warp may be produced by the southwestern fields being more metal - poor and/or younger than the rest of the lmc disk .",
    "there are a number of arguments against this hypothesis .",
    "first , the appearance of the cmds appear to rule out large bulk differences in age or metallicity between the southwestern and the remaining fields .",
    "figure 8 shows the combined cmds plotted against girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) isochrones with ages of 2 and 4 gyr and [ fe / h ] equal to @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the similar slopes of the red giant branches in the southwestern fields compared to the other fields suggest that the ages and metallicities of the red clump stars are also similar .",
    "second , the variation due to age and metallicity of the @xmath8 luminosity of the red clump is predicted to be small across the lmc .",
    "gs01 , using the lmc bar and outer disk star formation histories derived by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) coupled with the age - metallicity relation predicted by pagel & tautvaisiene ( 1998 ) , calculated that the bar red clump should be only 0.01 @xmath8 magnitudes brighter than the outer disk red clump .",
    "we derive a similar result by feeding the star formation histories derived by smecker - hane et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the lmc bar and disk through the gs01 models .",
    "we find that the lmc bar should have a red clump brighter than the disk by @xmath10.03 magnitudes , despite the bar having a @xmath42 gyr younger age . for comparison , smecker - hane et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that the red clump in their bar field is 0.02 magnitudes brighter in @xmath8 than in their disk field . after correcting for the 0.04 magnitude larger @xmath38 in their bar field and for our solution of the lmc s tilt , which places their bar field 0.02 magnitudes closer than their disk field",
    ", we find that their bar red clump is 0.04 magnitudes more luminous than their disk red clump .",
    "this measurement is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "thus , both theory and observations show that the mean properties of field red clump stars are less sensitive to age and metallicity effects than are single - age , single - metallicity populations .",
    "this is to be expected from the composite nature of stars in the field .",
    "third , differential rotation in the lmc shreds unbound coherent structure on the orbital timescale ( 270 myr at @xmath46=3 kpc , adopting @xmath47 km s@xmath48 ; alves & nelson 2000 ) , while the bulk of the red clump stars in the lmc are at least @xmath44 gyr old ( gs01 ) .",
    "we thus do not expect that an area of the lmc @xmath42 kpc in size would retain a record of its locally produced age and metallicity distribution , distinct from fields at similar radii .",
    "a warp , on the other hand , would be a non - equilibrium , recently formed structure not yet mixed into the surroundings .    finally , explaining the supposed warp through population effects would require an age or metallicity gradient that is inconsistent with observed trends .",
    "the general trend in the lmc is for the younger clusters to lie preferentially towards the inner regions ( bica et al .",
    "1996 ) , in the oppposite sense from that required here .",
    "the required metallicity gradient ( @xmath49 dex over a stretch of @xmath42 kpc ) , while operating in the right sense , is much steeper than the weak radial gradient observed ( kontizas et al .",
    "1993 ) .    in summary , we think that the simplest explanation for the unusually bright red clump luminosities seen in our southwestern fields is that the lmc disk is warped , rather than that the southwest of the lmc is more metal - poor or younger than the rest of the disk .",
    "however , a detailed solution of the star formation and chemical enrichment histories implied by our fields is needed to answer the question definitively .",
    "we have studied the shape of the lmc by measuring the variation in luminosity of red clump stars across 50 13@xmath613  fields distributed over a 6@xmath66area .",
    "our observations were taken with the ctio 0.9-m telescope ccd camera using @xmath7 and @xmath8 filters .",
    "we clearly detect the tilt of the lmc disk through a decrease in brightness of the red clump stars along the lmc s ne - sw axis .",
    "our measured tilt of @xmath50 is in excellent agreement with the recent measurement of van der marel & cioni ( 2001 ) , _ as long as _ we exclude 15 fields in the southwest which appear to lie out of the plane of the disk .",
    "including _ all _ of the fields , we measure a lower inclination of @xmath51 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with that measured by caldwell & coulson ( 1986 ) ; however , the fitted plane is of lower statistical significance .",
    "we believe that we have detected a warp in the lmc disk which causes a region @xmath42 kpc wide in the southwest to lie out of the plane by @xmath42.5 kpc .",
    "if it exists , this out - of - plane feature is likely a non - virialized structure .",
    "how and when was it produced ?",
    "the location of the warp points a finger at the smc .",
    "according to the model by gardiner & noguchi ( 1996 ) , the lmc and smc endured a close encounter @xmath4200 myr ago which drew out the material that new occupies the inter - cloud region .",
    "it is possible that this interaction also altered the shape of the lmc disk .",
    "however , the position of the warp also aligns it with the major axis of the lmc s elliptical disk ( van der marel 2001 ) , the shape of which van der marel attributes to the tidal influence of the milky way .",
    "perhaps our suggested warp is an additional response to the milky way s tidal force ?",
    "weinberg ( 1998 , 2000 ) studied the mutual influence of the lmc and milky way through numerical simulations .",
    "although weinberg found that the long - term effect on the lmc s structure is simply heating of the disk , transient structures might also be produced .",
    "further exploration of the structure of the lmc could determine whether the warp is reflected in northeastern fields more distant than those observed here .",
    "the determination of the star formation and chemical enrichment history in the lmc s southwest would establish with certainty the contribution of age and metallicity effects to the observed red clump luminosities . in this study we avoided the lmc s inner regions , including the bar , as these are heavily crowded .",
    "measurement of the lmc s shape and thickness in these regions is of strong interest for understanding the contribution of lmc self - lensing to the observed microlensing events ( zhao & evans 2000 ) .",
    "while our results bear no consequence for the microlensing studies , they do add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that the lmc is not a simple flattened disk .",
    "a study of the red clump in the lmc bar , combined with the continued monitoring of the lmc for microlensing events by the supermacho project ( drake et al .",
    "2002 ) , could provide very interesting results .",

    "<S> random photometric errors and errors in the calibration are controlled to @xmath11% . </S>",
    "<S> following correction for reddening measured through the color of the red clump , we solve for the inclination and position angle of the line of nodes of the tilted plane of the lmc , finding @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our solution requires that we exclude 15 fields in the southwest of the lmc which have red clump magnitudes @xmath40.1 magnitudes brighter than the fitted plane . on the basis of these fields </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that the lmc disk is warped and twisted , containing features that extend up to 2.5 kpc out of the plane . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that alternative ways of producing red clump stars brighter than expected , such as variations in age and metallicity of the stars , are unlikely to explain our observations . </S>"
