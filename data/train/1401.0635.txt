    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close , interactive binaries comprised of a white dwarf and a late - type , main sequence star .",
    "the latter fills its corresponding roche lobe and loses matter via the lagrangian l@xmath0 point to the more massive , compact component . in most cases , the transferred matter forms an accretion disk around the white dwarf if the former has no strong magnetic field .",
    "the observational characteristics of cvs , upon which they are normally classified , depend greatly on the orbital period of the system , the mass accretion rate , and the strength of the above - mentioned magnetic field .",
    "the orbital period reflects not only the separation of the binary components , but also the size of the roche lobe - filling secondary and therefore its evolutionary status .",
    "in particular , cvs with periods over @xmath1hours still contain secondaries with radiative cores , and thus rely on magnetic breaking as a driving force to remove the angular momentum @xcite .",
    "systems with periods below this 3 hr threshold contain red dwarfs , which are fully convective .",
    "the magnetic breaking then becomes negligible , halting the mass transfer .",
    "before this happens , a significant number of cvs known as sw sex - type are observed within the @xmath2 hr period range @xcite .",
    "the sw sex stars were first identified by @xcite as eclipsing systems , which show characteristics very similar to each other and quite different from other cvs .",
    "apart from wide , non - symmetric eclipses , swsex stars exhibit high excitation lines as well as absorption features , shifts between eclipse and emission lines phasing , and single - peaked line profiles ( unusual for eclipsing binaries ) containing accretion disks @xcite .",
    "they are also defined as nova - likes , because the high mass transfer rate helps to maintain a hot and stable accretion disk devoid of dwarf - nova - type outbursts .",
    "a detailed description and discussion of properties of sw sex stars can be found in a number of papers from the discovery of the phenomenon @xcite to the latest reviews @xcite .",
    "sdss j075653.11 + 085831.8 ( hereinafter sdss0756 + 0858 ) was identified as a cv by @xcite from the sdss dr7 lists . from a very limited time coverage ( @xmath3hr ) they suggested that the object may have a period around two hours and",
    "thought it could be an intermediate polar .",
    "since they covered slightly less than the actual orbital period of the system , they probably missed the eclipse , without which a correct identification becomes very difficult .",
    "we observed the object during two seasons in 2012 and 2013 by means of spectroscopy and multicolour photometry .",
    "we find that sdss0756 + 0858 is a bona - fide member of the sw sex stars . here , we present the results of our observations , discuss the deduced parameters of the system and its geometry .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in section  [ sec : obs ] , while the results are presented and discussed in sections  [ sec : porb ] , [ sec : param ] , and [ sec : conclud ] . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we present our model of swsex stars and draw brief conclusions in section  [ sec : conclud2 ] .",
    "time - resolved photometry of sdss0756 + 0858  was obtained using the direct ccd imaging mode of the 0.84 m telescope of the observatorio astronmico nacional at san pedro mrtir ( oan spm ) in mexico .",
    "we obtained a long series of photometry in the @xmath4band and one or two orbital periods with each @xmath5 johnson - cousins filter .",
    "the log of photometric observations is given in table  [ tab : log ] .",
    "the photometric data were calibrated using landolt standard stars .",
    "the errors , ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 mag , were estimated from the magnitude dispersion of comparison stars with similar brightness .",
    "the light curve shows deep ( @xmath6 mag ) and wide ( @xmath7p@xmath8 ) eclipses . outside the eclipse",
    ", the object brightness varies smoothly with superposed short - time flickering .",
    "the ingress to the eclipse is steeper than the egress .",
    "such an eclipse shape is very common for swsex stars @xcite and was a defining feature of the class until it was later revealed that there are also non - eclipsing swsex stars @xcite .    in figure[fig :",
    "lc ] , the @xmath4-band light curve , comprised of nine orbits and folded with the orbital period , is presented .",
    "the period determination is described in the next section .",
    "two cycles are plotted to separate two distinct light curve morphologies .",
    "the left panel shows two orbits with a distinct hump before an eclipse , and a pronounced dip around phase of @xmath9 . in the right panel , the remaining light curves are combined , where the pre - eclipse hump is not so prominent and there is a distinct depression of brightness right after the eclipse .",
    "the dip around phase @xmath10 is also not as defined as it is in the left panel . in both cases ,",
    "the object reaches maximum brightness at phase @xmath11 .",
    ".log of observations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t : mod ]    the light curves of individual components of the binary system were obtained by integrating the emission from all the elements lying in a sight of view and are presented in the middle panel of figure[fig : modphot ] .",
    "the flux from the white dwarf is almost totally blocked by the thick disk .",
    "two equally dominant sources of emission from the model light curves are the accretion disk and the bright spot / arc ( denoted by the red and blue lines respectively ) .",
    "the disk s contribution is more significant after the eclipse , when the bright spot is largely hidden behind it .",
    "in contrast , the form of the light curve before the eclipses , is mostly determined by the bright spot .",
    "the eclipse corresponds to the blockage of the bright spot by the secondary .",
    "thus , the observational phase @xmath12 , which is assigned to the conjunction of the stellar components , does not coincide with the zero phase in figure[fig : modphot ] . the fit is not optimized mathematically , but it is sufficient to explain all the observed features : the eclipse , the pre - eclipse - hump , the depression around phase 0.6 - 0.7 , and even the little wiggle at @xmath13 reasonably well .",
    "the main parameters of the model are given in table[t : mod ] .",
    "we can achieve satisfactory qualitative resemblance between the modeled light curves and the observations by simply varying the system inclination and the hot spot parameters .",
    "all other parameters are fixed .",
    "the model describes also quite well the rv amplitude and phase of the emission lines as basically emanating from the hot spot .",
    "since the hot spot is extended , and its temperature is the highest at the impact point , there is a stratification of temperatures and hence the excitation levels along the arc .",
    "the lines of different excitation energies are predominantly formed at a different angles from the mass center , as marked in figure[fig : mod ] .",
    "heii arises from an area located the closest to the the center of mass of the binary and thus , has the lowest amplitude of the radial velocity .",
    "the lower the excitation level , the further is the weighted center of the line forming region along the arc , and , therefore , the larger is the radial velocity amplitude .",
    "the phasing of the lines relative to the orbital phase changes accordingly . in the bottom panel of figure[fig : modphot ] the calculated radial velocity curve for heii line is presented and it excellently describes points obtained from the observations .",
    "also shown are calculated velocities of stellar components , which are not observed .",
    "calculated velocities of balmer lines are not presented , so as not to crowd the figure .",
    "the model also is able to describe fine details , in particular , what happens at the phases @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "the white dwarf ( and the accretion disk in general ) has already reached the maximum positive velocity and it is moving toward stellar conjunction with decreasing radial velocity ( light blue curve ) .",
    "but emission lines , formed predominantly in the bright arc still have an increasing radial velocity peaking around phase @xmath14 ( blue curve ) . around that phase , however , the secondary starts eclipsing part of the bright arc where the matter with the growing velocities is concentrated , and the observer sees only the far extreme of the arc , which moves in the opposite direction .",
    "thus , for a brief moment before the total eclipse of the bright arc , we detect a less intense emission line with decreasing rv .",
    "this creates a zig - zag in the trailed spectra ( see figure[fig : trsp ] ) .",
    "the zig - zag is best pronounced in the heii line , since it is formed closer to the stream / dick impact point , which is eclipsed first , leaving rest of the arc visible . at the depth of the eclipse ( @xmath16 in phases determined by radial velocities )",
    ", the very tip of the retreating half of the disk or the hot arc is still visible ( see the cartoon at the top of the figure[fig : modphot ] ) .",
    "it contains matter moving away from the observer with the sum of keplerian and orbital velocities , and appears in the rv curves and trailed spectra as a high velocity tail .",
    "this model does not take into account the matter outflowing from the opposite side of the hot arc side in the disk .",
    "we think that the inclusion of that element would allow fine tuning of the model to the observations .",
    "we have unveiled a new eclipsing swsex star .",
    "it has an orbital period @xmath17hr , at the centre of a range of periods where the great majority of swsex stars cluster .",
    "it has all observational characteristics of this type of stars and , as such , increases the number of eclipsing systems of this particular type at these periods .",
    "we believe that this clustering is something not well understood and should be addressed , but it is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "on the other hand we have been able to reproduce the photometric and radial velocity curves of sdss0756 + 0858  by simply assuming that the emission lines are predominantly formed / observed from the hot , extended spot , without the additional speculative mechanisms proposed in other models .",
    "we think that the absence of lines from other parts of the disk is a consequence of a disk having a high temperature and a surface density regime , and partially due to self obscuration by the thick rim at the same time .",
    "we also , believe that there is an outflow of matter from the opposite to the arc side of the disk , where the absorption features observed in swsex objects are formed",
    ". that outflowing matter may also contribute to the high velocity components of the low - excitation lines .",
