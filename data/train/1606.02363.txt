    "it plays the role for @xmath295 that the bisectrice plays for @xmath128 and @xmath186 . also note that for each restriction , all inequalities are non - strict in the special case @xmath177 , just as before .    when @xmath303 , we find using the same argument as in the classical case that @xmath304 gives the optimal region . at this value of @xmath91 , @xmath305 and",
    "@xmath306 coincide , and and are less restrictive than and .",
    "furthermore , since the line corresponding to rotates about @xmath192 , we may use interpolation to remove the restriction @xmath203 .    in the case",
    "@xmath179 , we repeat the argument used for the classical nse and make changes where necessary . assume first that @xmath307 .",
    "then we have @xmath308 @xmath309 now @xmath188 and the sum on the right is bounded whenever @xmath189 . substituting in for @xmath190 and simplifying , we obtain @xmath310    note that as @xmath91 increases , the line corresponding to equality rotates counterclockwise about @xmath311 . combining and with inequality replaced by equality in both cases , we find the curve @xmath312 where @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "notice that the curve contains both @xmath311 and @xmath192 , as we expect it to ( indeed , these points are the two axes of rotation for our lines ) .",
    "however , since we are restricted to the case when @xmath179 , the part of the curve that we can use is limited to that connecting @xmath211 and @xmath192 .    if @xmath313 , then is not valid for all values of @xmath142 . in particular , we need @xmath314 for the obvious application of hlder to be valid , which translates to @xmath315 .",
    "when @xmath316 , we also see that the two places where the curve crosses the @xmath317-axis are at @xmath318 and @xmath319 .",
    "when @xmath316 , we have @xmath320 .",
    "so the curve still gives us a meaningful restriction up to the point where it crosses the @xmath317-axis for the first time .",
    "once @xmath321 , however , we have @xmath322 , so the use of enstrophy does not allow us to make any statement about the range @xmath179 .",
    "figures [ fig : frac_78]-[fig : frac_58 ] diagram our results for a fixed value of @xmath328 ( we use @xmath329 ) and varying @xmath330 .",
    "note that the analogue of the lions space @xmath3 is @xmath331 , by interpolation with the onsager space @xmath332 .    as we take @xmath333 from below",
    ", the new region above the bissectrice collapses to the segment @xmath334 $ ] .",
    "in this respect , the value @xmath47 serves a similar role to the value @xmath46 in the classical case .",
    "things are slightly more complicated when @xmath335 . in this case , setting @xmath91 equal to its usually optimal value of @xmath198 places too heavy a burden on @xmath295 ; for a fixed @xmath9 , we must increase @xmath91 to optimize , until the restrictions on @xmath128 and @xmath295 coincide .",
    "an elementary computation gives the optimal value of @xmath91 to be @xmath336 we see then that as @xmath317 increases , the optimal value of @xmath91 decreases .",
    "when @xmath178 , the restriction on @xmath186 is always less stringent for this value of @xmath91 than the corresponding restriction for @xmath128 .",
    "however , as @xmath317 increases beyond @xmath337 , @xmath338 eventually becomes sufficiently small so that becomes limiting once again . at this point ,",
    "the optimal restriction is once again determined by the intersection of the @xmath128 and @xmath186 lines , following the curve .",
    "indeed , along the curve , @xmath91 is given by @xmath339(1 - 2x ) + 4\\g}{2(2\\g - 3x)}.\\ ] ] now , @xmath340 whereas @xmath341 @xmath342 so there must be some @xmath343 where @xmath344 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath345 does nt seem to take a particularly enlightening form in general , but it can be easily calculated given @xmath330 and @xmath346 .",
    "see figures [ fig : frac_78_dlarge ] and [ fig : frac_58_dlarge ] .            much of the analysis of the previous subsection carries over to the case when @xmath351 $ ] . however , there are a few important differences . for one thing ,",
    "the lions region is the single point @xmath352 when @xmath353 and trivial otherwise .",
    "second , the case @xmath354 is geometrically impossible , since @xmath355 here . finally , we can not say anything about the region @xmath179 .",
    "as was mentioned earlier , the enstrophy argument used to deal with this region for larger values of @xmath48 does not apply when @xmath356 .",
    "in fact , we can not even get any new information by interpolation with the leray - hopf line , since the point @xmath311 lies on the line @xmath357 when @xmath358 and to the right of this line when @xmath321 .",
    "so the region for which we have proved energy equality is independent of @xmath48 for @xmath321 ; the region depends only on @xmath1 .",
    "see figure [ fig : frac_14 ] .",
    "assume first that @xmath365 . then is more stringent then when @xmath366 ; the two inequalities coincide when @xmath47 . at this value of @xmath1 , the region satisfying ,",
    "is exactly the region already covered by the analogue of lions result .",
    "so only the case @xmath366 can give new information .",
    "however , in contrast to the classical case , the restrictions , are not always superfluous .",
    "if @xmath367 , then the lions region is trivial , and consequently the value @xmath368 has no special significance for our argument in the case of a general @xmath369-parabolic @xmath1-dimensional singularity with @xmath356 .",
    "when @xmath177 , the singularity set can be covered by finitely many time - slices , and the region covered is the same as in the one - slice case . when @xmath370 , the @xmath193-lines are limiting , but there is still a nontrivial region covered in the range @xmath179 , by interpolation .",
    "this region disappears when @xmath371 , but the @xmath193 lines remain the limiting restriction until @xmath1 surpasses the value @xmath372 , at which point the lower @xmath373 line ( corresponding to ) cuts into both the upper and lower @xmath193-lines .",
    "this situation prevails until @xmath1 reaches the value @xmath374 , at which point the lower @xmath373 line becomes more stringent than the lower @xmath193 line everywhere below the bisectrice .",
    "however , at this point the upper @xmath373 line is still less stringent than the upper @xmath193 line ; this changes once @xmath1 surpasses @xmath5 .",
    "note that the point @xmath254 is no longer included in the region covered for @xmath197 .",
    "rather , the upper @xmath373 line lies strictly below the interpolation line obtained in the region @xmath375 from the uppermost point on the @xmath193 segment .",
    "when @xmath1 lies in the range @xmath376 , the upper @xmath193 line remains more stringent than the @xmath373 lines on a small segment .",
    "however , once @xmath377 , the @xmath373 restrictions are limiting in all cases .",
    "there are a few larger values of significance for @xmath1 , but they involve the interaction between the @xmath373 lines and the lions region rather than the @xmath373 lines and the other restrictions imposed by our method . we describe briefly the bifurcations of the diagrams . when @xmath1 reaches the value @xmath378 , the lions point @xmath379 lies on the lower @xmath373 segment .",
    "when @xmath380 the new region below the bissectrice disappears entirely ( since @xmath381 for this value of @xmath1 ) .",
    "the new region disappears entirely into the lions region once @xmath382 .",
    "indeed , at this value of @xmath1 we have @xmath383 ; furthermore , both the upper @xmath373-line and the line containing the upper part of the boundary for the lions region pass through @xmath192 .",
    "therefore , the upper @xmath373-line collapses to ( a portion of ) the boundary of the lions region when @xmath384 .    finally , we make a remark about the case @xmath385 . the main technical reason why this case eludes our analysis is a failure to produce a proper cutoff function @xmath127 for which @xmath386 would remain under control , as @xmath387 would already develop jump discontinuities .",
    "however if @xmath177 , i.e. a finite - point set @xmath0 , one can construct each @xmath127 from @xmath388 s having disjoint support , allowing the analysis to be carried out . in this case",
