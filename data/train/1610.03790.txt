    "this is subject to intense research effort for measurements at the single - photon level @xcite , with higher intensity quantum optics @xcite and with matter @xcite . in all these cases the central motivation is to understand how to extract more information per - unit of resource ( such as probe power and interaction time ) and",
    "this will naturally lead to applications in precision measurement @xcite .",
    "an approach that dates back to the beginning of quantum optics @xcite is to improve phase sensitivity using squeezed states @xcite . in discrete quantum optics ,",
    "one approach has been to use path - entangled states , such as noon states @xcite , as a means to achieve supersensitivity since they exhibit interference patterns with increased frequency compared to classical light .",
    "so far , experiments have reached photon numbers of up to six @xcite photons , and recent works aim to address weaknesses in these schemes due to loss @xcite and state generation using non - deterministic processes @xcite .",
    "using probes multiple times can also enable a precision advantage , which varies according to the chosen notion of resource @xcite .",
    "spin squeezing has proven to be a useful approach thanks to developments in experiments manipulating atomic ensembles @xcite . in these experiments",
    "ensemble measurements are typically used , which correspond to collective observables for all particles in the ensemble .",
    "however , experiments that utilise detections at the single - particle level , can in principle achieve sensitivity beyond that achievable using ensemble measurements @xcite .",
    "the total statistical information that can be extracted from a measurement of an unknown phase shift is captured by the fisher information @xcite , which is evaluated for all measurement outcomes . because it is well known that squeezing can improve the phase sensitivity in many set - ups , it is important to quantify the sensitivity improvement with squeezing , and how close this sensitivity is to the maximum phase sensitivity as quantified using fisher information .    in this paper , we focus on measurements using spin squeezing @xcite , which has been shown to enable supersensitive precision in several experiments using ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "we report on an experimental investigation of the phase sensitivity achievable using an optical spin - squeezed state , which was originally considered by yurke et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "our setup generates five - photon yurke states using one - photon subtraction from light emitted by a parametric downconversion source @xcite , and we use spatially multiplexed pseudo - number - resolving detection to reconstruct photon - number statistics at the output @xcite .",
    "our analysis demonstrates supersensitive phase measurement from the observed optical yurke state , using all five - photon coincidence outcomes .",
    "we investigate the role of spin squeezing in achieving this quantum enhancement .",
    "consider first @xmath0 uncorrelated single photons , where each photon is in a superposition of horizontal ( h ) and vertical ( v ) polarizations , @xmath1 .",
    "when we measure this state in hv - polarization basis , the probability that @xmath2 photons are detected with h polarization and @xmath3 photons with v polarization is given by the binomial distribution @xmath4 .",
    "the noise obtained from this distribution is given by @xmath5 , which is called shot noise for phase estimation .",
    "the state which we consider here , sometimes referred to as the yurke state @xcite , is a superposition of the two states of @xmath6 photons are in one optical mode ( e. g. horizontal polarization ) and @xmath7 photons are in an orthogonal mode ( e. g. vertical polarization ) of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is restricted to odd values . if we adopt polarization encoding and measure in the hv basis , the outcomes take two values with photon - number difference @xmath10 .",
    "the noise of yurke state is therefore @xmath11 which is smaller than that using @xmath0 uncorrelated photons with a noise of @xmath5 .",
    "more generally , the photon statistics of any two - mode @xmath0-photon system can be described by the stokes parameters describing the photon - number differences between h and v polarization , diagonal ( d ) and anti - diagonal ( a ) polarization , and right - circular ( r ) and left - circular ( l ) polarization , @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the creation , annihilation and number operators for the corresponding modes .",
    "the average of these parameters , @xmath16 , is @xmath17 for uncorrelated photons and @xmath18 for the yurke state , indicating that these vectors align with the @xmath19 axis of the poincare sphere .",

    "specifically , the phase error at @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 because @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the yurke state , the phase error by squeezing of yurke state is @xmath43 .",
    "to characterise the improvement of the phase sensitivity due to squeezing , we use another squeezing parameter @xmath44 which was introduced in ref @xcite , which is the ratio of the phase error for a general state and phase error due to shot noise @xmath45 , with @xmath46 . for @xmath47 ,",
    "the phase error is smaller than the shot - noise limit attained by uncorrelated photons @xmath48 . for the yurke state ,",
    "@xmath49 for the high-@xmath0 limit .",
    "although squeezing of the stokes parameters can improve phase sensitivity beyond the shot - noise limit , additional phase sensitivity can be achieved by phase estimation which accounts for the full distribution of measurement outcomes .",

    "the averages of the probability distributions follow the sine - pattern . the output noise in figure 3a",
    "is clearly reduced at around @xmath39 where the squeezing sensitivity is maximum , whereas the noise in figure 3f is limited by shot noise .",
    "figures 3b , 3c , 3 g and 3h show the probability distributions for specific bias phases where the averages values of @xmath22 are nearly maximum ( figures 3b and 3 g ) and are nearly zero ( figures 3c and 3h ) respectively . one can be seen from figure 3b that the effect of two photon coherence appears as the photon - number oscillation for yurke state @xcite ( the peaks are observed at @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) , and results in the reduced quantum noise at the phase where the average is nearly zero ( figure 3c ) . on the other hand , for the classical uncorrelated case , the probability distribution of a classical state does not show the oscillation ( figure 3 g ) , resulting in shot - noise at the output at the phase where the average is nearly zero ( figure 3h ) .     * fisher information extracted from interference fringes : * the fisher information for the yurke state calculated using equation ( 3 ) , from probability distributions which are fitted to the experimental data .",

    "the maximum of fisher information is @xmath77 at bias phase of @xmath78 which is slightly different from the phase where the squeezing is maximum .",
