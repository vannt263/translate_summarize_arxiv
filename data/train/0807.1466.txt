    "superconductivity in multiband metals was first investigated theoretically shortly after the bcs theory@xcite .",
    "a resurgence of interest in multiband superconductivity has been mostly related to experimental discovery of mgb@xmath1@xcite , and observation of the two s - wave gaps by various techniques@xcite .",
    "recent discovery of iron oxypnictides@xcite , a new family of quasi-2d high temperature superconductors , has also attracted enormous theoretical interest to the problem of multiband superconductivity .",
    "first principles numerical band structure calculations@xcite show that several bands cross the fermi level in these materials .",
    "while the pairing mechanism in iron oxypnictides is not yet clear , several bands are involved in the determination of both normal and superconducting properties@xcite .",
    "the existence of multiband energy spectrum@xcite and associated several energy gaps@xcite was also verified experimentally in an older , quasi-2d s - wave superconductor nbse@xmath1 .",
    "bcs investigations of multiband superconductivity were restarted@xcite , but were mostly centered around the new physics that arises due to the presence of two separate gaps .",
    "the multiband energy spectrum is also present in most unconventional heavy fermion superconductors due to extreme complexity of the band structure of these materials , as indicated by de haas van alfven measurements .",
    "for example , gapless superconductivity of abrikosov - gorkov type@xcite was recently observed in thermal conductivity data for la - doped cecoin@xmath2@xcite , as indicated by unusual wiedeman - franz @xmath3 behavior of thermal conductivity at small concentration of la , @xmath4 .",
    "the unusual behavior was attributed to the multiband structure@xcite of this material , a d - wave superconductor .",
    "theoretical study of multiband superconductivity has not only been motivated by the above compounds .",
    "a somewhat modified multiband model is applicable to other new materials@xcite , where a single fermi surface gets spin - split into two pieces with different fermi momenta due to interactions , such as superconductors without center of inversion ( ci)@xcite ( for example , cept@xmath5si@xcite ) , or ferromagnetic superconductors ( uge@xmath1@xcite , zrzn@xmath1@xcite , or urhge@xcite ) .",
    "a particular case of ci - symmetry breaking is two - dimensional surface superconductivity@xcite , where two fermi surfaces arise as a result of spin - orbit interaction of rashba form@xcite .",
    "the fermi surface will also get spin - split in exchange field , an external magnetic field without orbital effects .",
    "theoretically , paramagnetic pair - breaking by exchange field corresponds to the old problem of unbalanced pairing , first studied in the early 60-s@xcite , when the @xmath0 phase diagram for three - dimensional materials in exchange field has first been obtained .",
    "orbital effects are almost always present in three dimensions , and even in very anisotropic quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials , unless @xmath6 in magnetic fields parallel to the 2d plane close to clogston paramagnetic limit@xcite .",
    "this is , perhaps , the reason why the consequences of the theory have not studied in detail experimentally .",
    "a study of thin films in magnetic fields parallel to the surface remains , perhaps , the most promising experimental setup for the observation of unbalanced pairing in superconductors@xcite . a possible observation of the larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrel ( loff)@xcite has also been reported in some quasi 2d superconductors , such as those based on charge - transfer organic salts of bedt - ttf or et - ion@xcite and the 1 - 1 - 5 family heavy fermion materials@xcite .    while most theoretical studies of superconductivity in multiband compounds concentrated on the mechanism of superconductivity and the effects of several energy gaps on superconducting properties , some recent studies@xcite found that a new class of superfluids could potentially arise in these materials , one that features coexistence of fully gapped and gapless states .",
    "for the most part , this class of states was proposed in bose - einstein condensation for different non - identical fermions condensed by an optical trap@xcite , or in high - energy physics@xcite , where the `` breached '' superfluid state appears as a result of pairing between different quarks@xcite in the asymptotically free limit .",
    "gapless solutions of this type were previously known , but in most cases were found to be energetically unstable .",
    "the first example corresponds to the second unstable solution in the unbalanced pairing problem , and is commonly referred to as sarma state@xcite .",
    "the second solution of the gap equation for a superconductor placed in an exchange field was first obtained by green s functions method by baltensperger@xcite and gorkov and rusinov@xcite , where it was found to be energetically unstable .",
    "the exact nature of this unstable state , and the existence of unpaired electron- and hole- fermi surfaces was later clarified within bcs theory by sarma and takada@xcite ) .",
    "the second example is pairing in a doped ( unbalanced ) excitonic gas , leading to an excitonic condensate@xcite , which is actually the same two - band unbalanced pairing problem as one considered by liu and wilczek@xcite .",
    "the solution previously found for this problem takes the form of a magnetically ( ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically ) polarized gapless state@xcite , and is different from `` interior gap superfluid '' of liu and wilczek .",
    "similar to sarma state , this solution is usually unstable with respect to formation of loff state or domains@xcite , although the stability of this magnetic solution has not been fully investigated as a function of masses involved .",
    "the third example is the sarma gapless state , which appears in the problem of s - wave pairing in ferromagnetic superconductors@xcite .",
    "while it has been claimed@xcite that sarma state is stabilized by the presence of ferromagnetic order , this claim has been debated later@xcite . according to recent work of liu and wilczek ,",
    "a large difference in effective masses on two fermi surfaces tends to stabilize the `` breached '' superfluid state already within the unbalanced pairing problem@xcite .",
    "the main motivation for this paper is a detailed theoretical study of possible new gapless states in multiband superconductors in the presence of exchange magnetic field@xcite , or the multiband unbalanced pairing problem . while certain similarity does exist ,",
    "the multiband problem is really different@xcite from the unbalanced pairing problem considered in the above cases ; pairing between two different species of fermions ( two different bands ) is usually not a relevant mechanism in multiband superconductors , since the energy difference for the two bands , @xmath7 is much greater than @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , for a superconductor placed in an external `` exchange '' field the unbalanced pairing problem is recovered .",
    "surprisingly , as it was shown in ref.@xcite , the multiband structure often leads to a a stabilization of unusual sarma state on the second band in exchange fields @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the energy band on the second fermi surface .",
    "thus , in quasi-2d superconductors where several bands cross the fermi surface , such as cecoin@xmath2 of 2h - nb@xmath11 , the peculiarities of the @xmath0 phase diagram may not limited to high magnetic fields , where the loff - related phenomena are observed .",
    "new singularities and gapless states associated with the gaps on secondary fermi surfaces must arise in _ low _ magnetic fields as well@xcite .",
    "they correspond to the appearance of sarma state@xcite on the fermi surface with smaller gap , one that becomes energetically stable due to the presence of the superconducting gap on the other fermi surface .",
    "this state is characterized@xcite by the presence of unpaired spin - polarized electrons near the fermi surface of the second band , two open electron- and hole- fermi surfaces , a paramagnetic magnetic moment , and a first - order phase transition that always accompanies the appearance of this unusual state in s - wave multiband superconductors in low magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the multiband model and generalize its known solution in the s - wave case to include effects of gap anisotropy and non s - wave pairing symmetry .",
    "we demonstrate that the effective coupling constants can be eliminated in favor of the measurable parameters for multiband superconductors , such as the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath12 , and the ratio of the gap amplitudes and the densities of states on different fermi surfaces .",
    "in particular , thermodynamics of multiband superconductors is additive ; the thermodynamic potential @xmath13 is a simple bcs sum over different bands . in section",
    "iii we consider the problem of paramagnetic pair - breaking in multiband superconductors and show that a new gapless state is energetically stable in low magnetic fields in some region of model parameters .",
    "we investigate the stability and the magnetic properties of this new gapless state in an s - wave two - band superconductor analytically at @xmath14 , and provide the details for the @xmath0 phase diagram and the low temperature critical point that separates the new partially gapless state from fully gapped state . in section",
    "iv we present our conclusions .",
    "in a standard bcs approach@xcite the pairing interaction can always be eliminated in favor of a single energy scale , @xmath12 , giving rise to the well - known universality of the bcs theory .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath12 is the only parameter that determines thermodynamic , kinetic , and other properties in the weak coupling limit .",
    "for example , the superconducting gap at zero temperature , @xmath15 , is related to @xmath12 in s - wave superconductors by the universal law , @xmath16 .",
    "similar universality is applicable to non s - wave superconductors as well , even though the universal ratio @xmath17 depends on the type of pairing . for d - wave pairing ,",
    "the weak coupling ratio of the maximum gap amplitude at @xmath14 to @xmath12 is @xmath18@xcite . since a number of interaction parameters",
    "are involved in a multiband model , there is no such universal relation between @xmath19 on different fermi surfaces and @xmath12 .",
    "thus , @xmath12 can not be the only parameter that describes the properties of multiband superconductors .",
    "geilikman , zaitsev , and kresin@xcite showed using the method of pokrovskii@xcite that some universality is left in the weak coupling multiband model .",
    "first , the physical properties , such as thermodynamics , are often additive over different bands .",
    "second , the ratios of the gap amplitudes on different fermi surfaces are temperature - independent in the weak coupling limit .",
    "third , geilikman _ _ et al.__@xcite found that all physical properties of a bcs multiband superconductor can be expressed in terms of the transition temperature @xmath12 , and other quantities measurable in the normal state , such as the ratios of densities of states on different fermi surfaces , and the temperature - independent ratio gap amplitudes .",
    "the gap amplitudes themselves , however , are not universal . in this section",
    "we introduce the multiband model , review some of the results of geilikman _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite that we will use in other sections , and generalize their weak - coupling solution to the case of arbitrary anisotropic pairing .",
    "the hamiltonian for several separate fermi surfaces has the following form ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) :",
    "@xmath20    where @xmath21 are spin indices , @xmath22 corresponds to the model interaction for a pair of electrons from band @xmath23 with quasimomentum @xmath24 to band @xmath25 with quasimomentum @xmath26 .",
    "the latter can be written in the following form : @xmath27 note that the unbalanced pairing terms@xcite are not present in this model bcs formulation , since the mismatch between different fermi surfaces is usually too large ( of the order of @xmath28 ) for these terms to be relevant .",
    "we consider below any possible type of the superconducting state . as usual , the interactions in the model bcs hamiltonian are taken in a factorized form , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the appropriate irreducible representation , normalized to unity : @xmath31 for example , for the s - wave pairing @xmath32 while for the d - wave pairing , @xmath33    the energy gaps on each fermi surface @xmath34 can be easily expressed in terms of the interaction matrix @xmath35 and the anomalous gorkov functions @xmath36 : @xmath37 the transition temperature @xmath12 is determined by the linearized gap equation eq.([gapeq ] ) for the gap amplitude @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 while the eigenvector @xmath41 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the interaction matrix @xmath42 determines the ratios between gaps on different fermi surfaces set at @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath43 are the densities of states ( dos ) per one spin direction for various fermi surfaces .",
    "while the system of gap equations eq.([gapeq ] ) seems to give a temperature - dependent ratio for gaps on different fermi surfaces , this result would violate the bcs logarithmic approximation . within the logarithmic accuracy ,",
    "the ratios between the gaps on different fermi surfaces is set at @xmath12 from eq.([gapeqlin ] ) , and is a temperature - independent constant set by the interaction matrix eq.([intmatr ] ) , the highest eigenvalue gap eigenvector @xcite .",
    "then the multiband problem can be parameterized in terms of @xmath12 and the gap ratios , similar to how this is done in the single - band bcs model .",
    "an additional related difficulty comes from the fact that the kernel for the system of fredholm integral equations eq.([gapeq ] ) is asymmetric , i.e. , @xmath44 for @xmath45 . generalizing the approach of pokrovskii@xcite and following geilikman _ _ et al.__@xcite , we introduce new variables and a symmetric kernel @xmath46 , @xmath47 as usual , the gap equation in terms of the universal scale @xmath12 can be obtained by subtracting eq.([gapeqlin ] ) from eq.([gapeq ] ) . writing the result in new variables ,",
    "we find :    @xmath48 =   \\sum_{\\beta } \\mu_{\\alpha \\beta } \\zeta_{\\beta } \\ln{\\left[\\frac{t}{t_c}\\right]}. \\label{interstep}\\ ] ]    let us now multiply eq.([interstep ] ) by @xmath49 , and sum over @xmath25 , using the symmetry of @xmath50 and eq.([gapeqlin ] ) , @xmath51 the gap equation is then considerably simplified , and can be written in the universal form :    @xmath52 =   \\ln{\\left[\\frac{t}{t_c}\\right]}. \\label{univgap}\\ ] ]    here @xmath53 are constant ratios , determined by the gap eigenvector at @xmath12 and the corresponding densities of states .",
    "the coefficients @xmath54 are automatically normalized : @xmath55",
    "as demonstrated in the above derivation , all physical properties in the multiband bcs model can be expressed in terms of the transition temperature @xmath12 , the relevant dos , and temperature - independent gap amplitudes .",
    "the gap amplitudes themselves , however , are not universal . the ratios of the gaps on different fermi surfaces are non - universal constants , determined by the relevant interaction matrix ( the highest - eigenvalue eigenvector for @xmath42 in eq.([gapeqlin ] ) ) .",
    "eq.([univgap ] ) can be easily solved at @xmath14 . introducing the usual normalization for the gap , @xmath56 and defining @xmath57 as @xmath58 we find : @xmath59 which sets a constraint on the amplitude of the gap eigenvector at @xmath14 .",
    "eq.([bcsd ] ) gives a standard expression for the zero - temperature amplitude of the energy gap for any single - band bcs superconductor .",
    "for example , @xmath60 note that due to the normalization condition eq.([norm ] ) , our definition for the d - wave gap amplitude is different from the standard definition by a factor of @xmath61 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the gap amplitude @xmath62 is determined by the universal gap equation eq.([univgap ] ) . for the general case multiband case",
    "it differs from the single - band bcs temperature dependence :    @xmath63 \\label{gaptdep}\\ ] ]    since the ratios of the gaps on different fermi surfaces are set at @xmath12 , one can obtain thermodynamic potential integrating the gap equation eq.([gaptdep ] ) over the single coupling constant , @xmath12 : @xmath64 thermodynamics is then given by a sum of standard weak coupling expressions for separate bands expressed in terms of temperature - dependent energy gaps @xmath65 :    @xmath66    integrating the above expression over @xmath67 at zero temperature , one finds the familiar@xcite factorized result for the ground state energy :    @xmath68    where we have used the normalization condition for @xmath69 given by eq.([norm ] ) .",
    "the multiband gap equation does produce overall change for the relevant quantities , such as , for example , specific heat jump at transition temperature , @xmath12 , obtained , for example , in ref.@xcite :    @xmath70    the above result of geilikman _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite is applicable to any anisotropic or unconventional superconductors belonging to a one - dimensional representation of the point group@xcite , which includes d - wave multiband superconductors .",
    "for superconductors belonging to a degenerate representation of the point group , the corresponding generalized formula is given by @xmath71_{bcs } \\frac{1}{\\sum_{\\alpha } \\nu_{\\alpha}}\\ ,     \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{\\alpha } \\nu_{\\alpha } \\delta_{\\alpha}^2 \\right)^2}{\\sum_{\\alpha } \\nu_{\\alpha } \\delta_{\\alpha}^4}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath72_{bcs}$ ] is the weak coupling value of the specific heat jump at @xmath12 for a given multiband representation , given , for example , by kuznetsova and the author in ref.@xcite .    as a simple example , let us consider the two - band case .",
    "the expression for the constant ratio of the energy gaps on different fermi surfaces is then very easily obtained from eq.([gapeqlin ] ) in terms of the interaction constants eq.([intmatr ] ) ( also see , for example , ref.@xcite ) :    @xmath73    the other relevant parameter of the bcs model is @xmath74 , defined by eq.([us ] ) : @xmath75 since the gaps on all fermi surfaces have the same temperature dependence , let us introduce a normalized gap amplitude @xmath76 as given by eq.([gapt0 ] ) , @xmath77 we then easily find the expression for zero - temperature gaps on the two fermi surfaces : @xmath78 the temperature dependence of the gaps on the two fermi surfaces must be the same .",
    "in addition to @xmath12 , thermodynamics is completely determined by two other parameters , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which can be easily found from experiment .",
    "we conclude that the universality of the weak - coupling bcs - like model is applicable to the multiband case .",
    "however , some non - universal constants , which depend on the interactions , do enter the problem as temperature - independent parameters .",
    "the total number of independent parameters for an @xmath81-band bcs model is then significantly reduced to @xmath82 measurable constants : @xmath12 , @xmath83 independent constant dos ratios @xmath84 , and @xmath83 independent constant gap ratios @xmath85 .",
    "a significant temperature dependence of the energy gap ratios on different fermi surfaces as , for example , observed in mgb@xmath1 , then corresponds to the failure of the weak coupling logarithmic approximation .",
    "in this section we consider the unbalanced pairing problem@xcite for a multiband s - wave superconductor placed in paramagnetic magnetic field .",
    "the author and gorkov@xcite have recently shown that a new stable gapless state appears in small magnetic fields .",
    "the emergence of this state for s - wave superconductors is accompanied by zero - temperature first order phase transition .",
    "the s - wave case can be solved analytically at @xmath14 . in what follows ,",
    "we present our results for the stability of the gapless state in s - wave multiband superconductors and the details of the @xmath0 phase diagram .",
    "we start by considering the general solution for the bcs gap equation for a multiband superconductor placed in magnetic field .",
    "we neglect the diamagnetic effects ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the presence of paramagnetic magnetic field results in an additional pauli term in the hamiltonian for each seperate band : @xmath86 here @xmath87 is the g - factor for each band @xmath25 , taken to be isotropic in this section .",
    "the multiband gap equations in magnetic field have the same form eq.([gapeq ] ) , with the gorkov function @xmath88 given by    @xmath89    the diagonalization procedure of pokrovskii@xcite and geilikman _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite is applicable in the presence of arbitrary magnetic field , i.e. , the ratios of the gaps on different fermi surfaces do not change as functions of both temperature and magnetic field , and are determined by the gap eigenvector at @xmath12 .",

    "we consider the low field transition to partial gapless state .",

    "we see that in order for the gapless state to be present and easily observable , the second gap has to be much smaller than the first gap , while the density of states on the second fermi surface should be quite a bit larger than on the first one , otherwise the entropy change associated with the first order transition will be very small and not easily detectable .",
    "such transition will also be turned into a crossover in the presence of even small gap anisotropy , impurities , non - zero temperature , or other effects@xcite .",
    "we have not considered the details of the high - field stripe loff@xcite region beyond the loff instability in the normal state given by eq.([tcbloff ] ) and shown in fig .",

    "we note , however , that the loff stripe phase will also be unusual , since it forms in high enough magnetic fields in the vicinity of the first order transition between partially gapless state and the normal state .",
    "in particular , the inhomogeneous loff state will likely involve superconducting stripe order made out of the partially gapless state .",
    "it is also not completely clear whether the phase transitions between the partially gapless superconducting state and the loff state and between the loff state and the normal state will be first or second order .",
    "the mathematics of the low - field critical region near the @xmath14 first order phase transition into the partially gapless superconducting state and the associated thermodynamics is rather bulky , and can only be studied numerically for the general case ( see figs.[fig2]-[fig5 ] ) . nevertheless , as it was shown in the previous subsections , _ only parameters for the second fermi surface _",

    "however , when @xmath155 , the critical region lies at very low temperatures , and thus only the quasiparticle excitations near the gapless or nearly gapless state on the second fermi surface are important .",
    "the results for the critical region then depend only on parameters of the second fermi surface only , and thus it can be found in a universal form .",
    "we note that the special case @xmath155 , corresponding to superconductivity driven by a single fermi surface and induced by interactions on other fermi surfaces is , perhaps , most common for multiband superconductors . in this section",

    "similar effects must be present for the low - field metamagnetic phase transition as well .",
    "gap anisotropy , g - factor anisotropy , and spin - orbit coupling tend to wipe out the first order line on the @xmath0 phase diagram , and turn it in a smooth crossover@xcite .",
    "we have recently found that the order of the phase transition in the presence of spin orbit interaction may , too , be dependent on direction . as a result of two different terms in the spin orbit interaction ,",
    "the first order phase transition becomes very anisotropic .",
    "it is present for some field directions and turns into a smooth crossover for other field directions@xcite",
    ".    experimental observation of the new gapless state is subject to the usual difficulties associated with the observation of paramagnetic pair breaking and the loff state in superconductors .",
    "namely , the orbital effects leading to @xmath6 are almost always present , even in strongly quasi-2d materials in magnetic fields parallel to the 2d planes .",
    "perhaps , an ideal realization of this state would be surface superconductivity or superconductivity in thin films in fields parallel to the surface .",
    "we note , however , that unlike the loff state , which is difficult to observe , since it quickly disappears in the presence of impurities or orbital effects , the new homogeneous partially gapless state is more robust , and will appear in many multiband strongly quasi-2d s - wave superconductors in the mixed state as well , provided that the upper critical field is close enough to the clogston limit .",
    "the details of such first order transition in the mixed state will be similar to the physics considered above .",
