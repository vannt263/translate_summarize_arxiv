    "a hierarchical triple system consists of a binary system and a third body on a wider orbit .",
    "the motion of such a system can be pictured as the motion of two binaries on slowly perturbed keplerian orbits : the binary itself ( inner binary ) and the binary which consists of the third body and the centre of mass of the binary ( outer binary ) .",
    "hierarchical triple systems are widely present in the galactic field and in star clusters and studying the dynamical evolution of such systems is a key to understanding a number of issues in astronomy and astrophysics , such as tidal friction and dissipation , mass transfer and mass loss due to a stellar wind , which may result in changes in stellar structure and evolution ( for systems with _ close _",
    "inner binaries , where the separation between the components is comparable to the radii of the bodies ) .",
    "but even in systems with well - separated inner binary components , the perturbation of the third body can have a devastating effect on the triple system as a whole ( e.g. disruption of the system ) .    for most hierarchical triple stars ,",
    "the period ratio @xmath1 is of the order of 100 and these systems are probably very stable dynamically .",
    "however , there are systems with much smaller period ratios , like the system hd 109648 with @xmath2 ( jha et al .",
    "2000 ) , the @xmath3 tau system , with @xmath4 ( fekel @xmath5 tomkin 1982 ) and the ch cyg system with @xmath6 ( hinkle et al . 1993 ) .    in two previous papers ( georgakarakos 2002,2003 , hereafter hts1 and hts2 respectively )",
    ", we derived formulae for the inner eccentricity in hierarchical triple systems with coplanar and initially circular inner orbit .",
    "however , the formulae were only tested for systems with comparable masses within the range @xmath7 ( stellar systems ) . in the present paper ,",
    "the testing is extended to systems with masses within the range @xmath8 , i.e. systems with jupiter - sized bodies .",
    "at this point , we would like to remind the reader of the formulae that were derived in hts1 and hts2 .",
    "the formula for the circular outer binary case is ( with the addition of two more short period terms , i.e. the next order terms in @xmath9 and @xmath10 legendre polynomials ; those terms which were included in hts2 for greater accuracy and were denoted as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , can be obtained by setting @xmath13 in equations ( 9 ) , ( 11 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) of hts2 ) : @xmath14 with @xmath15    the formula for the eccentric outer binary case is ( slightly different from the one in hts2 , as some coefficients have been corrected , see georgakarakos 2005 ) :    @xmath16+\\frac{1}{x(1-e^{2})^{\\frac{3}{2}}}[\\frac{61}{3}+\\frac{305}{2}e^{2}+\\frac{915}{8}e^{4}+\\frac{305}{48}e^{6}+\\frac{1}{(1-e^{2})^{\\frac{3}{2}}}(\\frac{61}{3}+\\frac{854}{3}e^{2}+\\frac{2135}{4}e^{4}+\\frac{2135}{12}e^{6}+\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{2135}{384}e^{8})]+m_{*}^{2}x^{\\frac{2}{3}}(1-e^{2})[\\frac{225}{256}+\\frac{3375}{1024}e^{2}+\\frac{7625}{2048}e^{4}+\\frac{29225}{8192}e^{6}+\\frac{48425}{16384}e^{8}+\\frac{825}{2048}e^{10}+\\frac{1}{(1-e^{2})^{\\frac{3}{2}}}(\\frac{225}{256}+\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{2925}{1024}e^{2}+\\frac{775}{256}e^{4}+\\frac{2225}{8192}e^{6}+\\frac{25}{512}e^{8})]+m_{*}^{2}\\frac{1}{x^{\\frac{4}{3}}(1-e^{2})^{2}}[\\frac{8361}{4096}+\\frac{125415}{8192}e^{2}+\\frac{376245}{32768}e^{4}+\\frac{41805}{65536}e^{6}+\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+\\frac{1}{(1-e^{2})^{\\frac{3}{2}}}(\\frac{8361}{4096}+\\frac{58527}{2048}e^{2}+\\frac{877905}{16384}e^{4}+\\frac{292635}{16384}e^{6}+\\frac{292635}{524288}e^{8})]\\right]+2(\\frac{c}{b - a})^{2}.\\label{final2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath17    in both cases : @xmath18 @xmath19 also , @xmath20 is the total mass of the system , @xmath21 and @xmath1 is the period ratio of the two orbits .",
    "in order to test the validity of the formulae derived in the previous papers , we integrated the full equations of motion numerically , using a symplectic integrator with time transformation ( mikkola 1997 ) .",
    "the code calculates the relative position and velocity vectors of the two binaries at every time step .",
    "then , by using standard two body formulae , we computed the orbital elements of the two binaries .",
    "the various parameters used by the code , were given the following values : writing index @xmath22 , method coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 , correction index @xmath25 .",
    "the average number of steps per inner binary period @xmath26 , was given the value of @xmath27 for testing the short period terms and the long term circular case .",
    "for the long period eccentric cases , we set @xmath28 in order to accelerate the execution of the code , without any precision cost , as the motion was mainly dominated by secular evolution .    for our simulations",
    ", we also defined the two mass ratios @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "following hts2 , for the eccentric outer binary case , we used the fictitious initial period ratio @xmath32 , defined as the ratio of the period that the outer binary would have on a circular orbit with a semi major axis equal to its periastron distance over the period of the inner binary . in all cases @xmath33 .",
    "we also used units such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 and we always started the integrations with @xmath36 . in that system of units , the initial conditions for the numerical integrations were as follows :    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    for the circular case ( @xmath41 is the initial relative phase of the two binaries ) and    @xmath37    @xmath42    @xmath39    @xmath43    for the non circular case , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the initial true anomaly and longitude of pericentre respectively of the outer orbit .      first , we present the results from testing equations ( [ final1 ] ) and ( [ final2 ] ) for long term behaviour .",
    "the formulae were compared with results obtained from integrating the full equations of motion numerically .",
    "for the circular case , each system was numerically integrated for @xmath46 with a step of @xmath47 .",
    "after each run , @xmath48 was averaged over time using the trapezium rule and after the integrations for all @xmath41 were done , we averaged over @xmath41 by using the rectangle rule .",
    "the integrations were also done for smaller steps in @xmath41 ( e.g. @xmath49 ) , but was not any difference in the outcome .    for the non circular case ,",
    "each system was numerically integrated for @xmath50 and @xmath51 with a step of @xmath52 . for a given value of @xmath45 and @xmath44 we integrated our system .",
    "after each run , @xmath48 was averaged over time using the trapezium rule and then we integrated the system for a different @xmath44 .",
    "after the integrations for all @xmath44 were done , we averaged over @xmath44 by using the rectangle rule .",
    "then , the same procedure was applied for the next value of @xmath45 and when the integrations for all @xmath45 were done , we averaged over @xmath45 by using the rectangle rule .",
    "the integrations were also done for smaller steps in @xmath45 and @xmath44 , but the difference in the outcome was insignificant .",
    "these results are presented in tables 1 , 2 and 3 ( @xmath53 respectively ) , which give the percentage error between the averaged numerical @xmath48 and equations ( [ final1 ] ) and ( [ final2 ] ) .",
    "the error is accompanied by the period of the oscillation of the eccentricity , which is the same as the integration time span ( when there is no period given , we integrated for an outer orbital period , i.e @xmath54 , as there was not any noticeable secular evolution ) .",
    "there are four values per ( @xmath55 ) pair , corresponding , from top to bottom , to @xmath56 respectively ( of course , for the eccentric outer binary case , @xmath1 is replaced by @xmath32 ) .",
    "generally , it appears that the theory is in agreement with the numerical integrations .",
    "there are some cases ( larger @xmath57 ) where the error is rather significant ( around @xmath58 ; however , the reader should have in mind that the error is in @xmath59 , which means that it is about double than the one in @xmath60 ) , but it dropped as the period ratio increased .",
    "there are also some cases where the formulae do not seem to work well ; in fact , for some systems ( e.g. @xmath61 , @xmath62,@xmath63 ) we have a complete failure of our formula . for those cases ,",
    "our formula gives an overestimate of the inner eccentricity ( our secular solution has larger period and amplitude of oscillation ) and that is due to the fact that @xmath64 gets small , i.e. our approximate secular solution is near resonance .",
    "this is demonstrated in figures 1,2 and 3 , which are plots of @xmath57 against @xmath65 for which @xmath66 .",
    "finally , for large eccentricities , there is a significant error for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which is due to terms omitted from the approximate secular solution .",
    "those terms become insignificant as @xmath32 increases .",
    ".percentage error between the averaged numerical @xmath69 and equation ( [ final1 ] ) .",
    "for all systems , @xmath13 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the time @xmath72 is in yrs ( the period of oscillation for the left graph is @xmath73 yrs and @xmath74 yrs for the right one).,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=226 ] , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "in two previous papers , we derived formulae for estimating the inner eccentricity in hierarchical triple systems with coplanar orbits and with the inner eccentricity being initially zero .",
    "however , those calculations were done for systems with comparable masses . in the present paper",
    ", we tested the formulae for systems with mass ratios from @xmath75 .",
    "the theoretical models appeared to work well for most of the cases . there were a few cases for which the theory did not work well , but no theory is perfect .",
    "finally , we applied the theory on the exosolar planetary system hd217107 , in an attempt to obtain more information about its orbital characteristics , although that kind of application was not part of the initial motivation for the construction of the models .",
    "we concluded that the two planets orbiting the host star are probably on non coplanar orbits .",
    "the derivation of a three dimensional formula for eccentric binaries is one of our future aims , as it would definitely prove more helpful for various dynamical problems , especially with the constant discovery of more and more exosolar planets every day .",
