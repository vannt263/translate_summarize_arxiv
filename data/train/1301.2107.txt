    "a characteristic feature of many real - world random phenomena is that the _ magnitude _ or the _ intensity _ of realized fluctuations varies in time or space , or both .",
    "there are various terms used in different contexts that roughly correspond to this characteristic . to highlight two of them , in studies of turbulence , this is called _ intermittency _ , whereas in finance and economics the corresponding notion is ( stochastic ) _",
    "volatility_. sudden extreme fluctuations  say , rapid changes in wind velocity or prices of financial securities  have often dire consequences , so understanding their statistical properties is clearly of key importance .",
    "barndorff - nielsen and schmiegel @xcite have introduced a class of lvy - based random fields , for which they coined the name _ ambit field _ , to model space - time random phenomena that exhibit intermittency or stochastic volatility .",
    "the primary application of ambit fields has been phenomenological modeling of turbulent velocity fields .",
    "additionally , barndorff - nielsen , benth , and veraart @xcite have recently applied ambit fields to modeling of the term structure of forward prices of electricity .",
    "electricity prices , in particular , are prone to rapid changes and spikes since the supply of electricity is inherently inelastic and electricity can not be stored efficiently .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , at a more theoretical level , some ambit fields have been found to arise as solutions to certain stochastic partial differential equations @xcite .",
    "barndorff - nielsen , benth , and veraart @xcite provide a survey on recent results on ambit fields and related _ ambit processes_.    in this paper , we study the asymptotic behavior of power variations of a two - parameter ambit field driven by white noise , with a view towards measuring the realized volatility of the ambit field .",
    "specifically , we consider ambit field @xmath0 ^ 2}$ ] , defined via the equation @xmath1 where the integrator @xmath2 is a white noise on @xmath3 and the integrand is defined in terms of a positive - valued , continuous _ volatility field _ @xmath4 and a _ weight function _ @xmath5 .",

    "more figuratively , @xmath8 defines the `` ambit '' of noise and volatility innovations that influence @xmath9 .",
    "we use here the common specification of @xmath8 as a translation of some fixed borel set @xmath10 , viz . , @xmath11 the shape of the set",

    "we consider here only the case where the volatility field @xmath16 and the white noise @xmath2 are _ independent_. in this case the integral in can be defined in a straightforward manner as a _ wiener integral _ , conditional on @xmath16 .",
    "( ambit fields with volatilities that do depend on the driving white noise can be defined , but then the integration theory becomes more involved , see @xcite for details .",
    "moreover , the general framework of ambit fields also accommodates non - gaussian random measures , lvy bases , as driving noise . )",
    "the power variations we study are defined over observations of @xmath13 on a _ square lattice _ in @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] using _ rectangular increments _ ( see section [ subs : pv ] for precise definitions ) .",
    "the spacing of the square lattice is @xmath18 , and we let @xmath19 in the asymptotic results .",
    "in addition to ordinary power variations that involve all of the available increments , we consider also _ thinned _ power variations that are computed using only every @xmath20-th increment in the lattice .",
    "asymptotically , we let @xmath21 so that @xmath22 .",

    "our first result is a functional law of large numbers for both ordinary and thinned power variations ( theorem [ thm : powerlln ] ) . under an assumption that constrains the memory of @xmath13 through the so - called _ concentration measures _ associated to the weight function @xmath23 ( assumption [ asm : lln ] ) ,",
    "we show that the suitably scaled power variation of @xmath13 converges in probability to an integral functional of the volatility field @xmath16 . under a more restrictive and quantitative version of assumption [ asm : lln ] ( which appears as assumption [ asm : clt ] ) , we also obtain a stable functional central limit theorem for thinned power variations ( theorem [ thm : powerclt ] ) with a conditionally gaussian random field as the limit .",
    "we give some explicit examples of weight functions @xmath23 that satisfy assumptions [ asm : lln ] or [ asm : clt ] in section [ subs : weight ] .",
    "the motivation of this paper is twofold .",
    "on the one hand , the study of the asymptotics of power variations of ambit fields is interesting from a probabilistic perspective , as it provides information on the fine structure of the realizations of ambit fields . on the other hand , in practical situations",
    "it is of interest to draw inference of volatility statistics of the form @xmath24 for @xmath25 , based on discrete observations of the ambit field @xmath13 .",

    "in fact , a brownian semistationary process is the one - parameter counterpart of an ambit field driven by white noise .",

    "we employ a similar approach , adapted to the two - parameter setting , in the proof of our central limit theorem .",
    "barndorff - nielsen and graversen @xcite have recently obtained a law of large numbers for the quadratic variation of an ambit process driven by white noise in a space - time setting . the probabilistic setup they consider is identical to ours , but their quadratic variation is defined over observations along a line in two - dimensional spacetime , instead of a square lattice .",
    "the proof of our law of large numbers is inspired by the arguments used in @xcite .",
    "compared to the one - parameter case , asymptotic results for lattice power variations of random fields with two or more parameters are scarser .",

    "<S> we study the asymptotic behavior of lattice power variations of two - parameter ambit fields that are driven by white noise . </S>",
    "<S> our first result is a law of large numbers for such power variations . under a constraint on the memory of the ambit field , </S>",
    "<S> normalized power variations are shown to converge to certain integral functionals of the volatility field associated to the ambit field , when the lattice spacing tends to zero . </S>",
    "<S> this law of large numbers holds also for thinned power variations that are computed by only including increments that are separated by gaps with a particular asymptotic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> our second result is a related stable central limit theorem for thinned power variations . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we provide concrete examples of ambit fields that satisfy the assumptions of our limit theorems .    </S>",
