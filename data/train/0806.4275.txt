    "the problem of finding self - consistent stellar models for galaxies is of wide interest in astrophysics .",
    "usually , once the potential - density pair ( pdp ) is formulated as a model for a galaxy , the next step is to find the corresponding distribution function ( df ) .",
    "this is one of the fundamental quantities in galactic dynamics specifying the distribution of the stars in the phase - space of positions and velocities . although the df can generally not be measured directly , there are some observationally accesible quantities that are closed related to the df : the projected density and the light - of - sight velocity , provided by photometric and kinematic observations , are examples of df s moments .",
    "thus , the formulation of a pdp with its corresponding equilibrium dfs establish a self - consistent stellar model that can be corroborated by astronomical observations .    on the other hand",
    ", a fact that is usually assumed in astrophysics is that the main part of the mass of a typical spiral galaxy is concentrated in a thin disc ( @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , the study of the gravitational potential generated by an idealized thin disc is a problem of great astrophysical relevance and so , through the years , different approaches has been used to obtain the pdp for such kind of thin disc models ( see @xcite and toomre ( @xcite ) , as examples ) .",
    "now , a simple method to obtain the pdp of thin discs of finite radius was developed by @xcite , the simplest example of disc obtained by this method being the kalnajs disc ( @xcite ) .    in a previous paper ( @xcite )",
    "we use the hunter method in order to obtain an infinite family of axially symmetric finite thin discs , characterized by a well - behaved surface density , whose first member is precisely the well - known kalnajs disc ( @xcite ) and , more recently , a detailed study of the kinematics characterizing such discs was be made by @xcite .",
    "so , in order to obtain self - consistent stellar models for this family of generalized kalnajs discs , we will consider at the present paper the derivation of some two - integral dfs for the first four members of the family .    now , as is stated by jeans s theorem , an equilibrium df is a function of the isolating integrals of motion that are conserved in each orbit and , as it has been shown , it is possible to find such kind of dfs for pdps such that there is a certain relationship between the mass density and the gravitational potential .",
    "the simplest case of physical interest corresponds to spherically symmetric pdps , which are described by isotropic dfs that depends on the total energy @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , as was be shown by @xcite , it is possible to obtain this kind of isotropic dfs by first expressing the density as a function of the potential and then solving an abel integral equation .",
    "recently , @xcite found that a similar procedure can be performed in the axially symmetric case , where the equilibrium df depends on the energy @xmath0 and the angular momentum about the axis of symmetry @xmath1 , i.e. the two classical integrals of motion .",
    "they developed a formalism that essentially combines both the eddington formulae and the @xcite expansion in order to obtain the df s even part , starting from a density that can be expressed as a function of the radial coordinate and the gravitational potential .",
    "once such even part is determined , the df s odd part can be obtained by introducing some reasonable assumptions about the mean circular velocity or using the maximum entropy principle .    on the other hand , another method appropriated to find dfs depending only of the jacobi s integral , @xmath2 , for",
    "axially symmetric flat galaxy models was introduced by @xcite for the case of disc - like systems and basically consists in to express the df as a derivative of the surface mass density with respect to the gravitational potential .",
    "such method does not demands solving an integral equation , but instead is necessary properly to express the mass density as a function of the gravitational potential , a procedure that is only possible in some cases .    in this paper",
    "we will use both of the mentioned approaches in order to obtain equilibrium dfs for some generalized kalnajs discs .",
    "accordingly , the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section [ sec : finteq ] , we present the fundamental aspects of the two methods that we will use in order to obtain the equilibrium dfs .",
    "then , in section [ sec : dfkal ] , we present a summary of the main aspects of the generalized kalnajs discs , at section [ sec : kal ] , and then , in sections [ sec : dfm1 ]  [ sec : dfm4 ] , we derive the dfs for the first four members of the family .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] , we summarize our main results .",
    "assume that @xmath3 and @xmath0 are , respectively , the gravitational potential and the energy of a star in a stellar system .",
    "one can choose a constant @xmath4 such that the system has only stars of the energy @xmath5 and then define a relative potential @xmath6 and a relative energy @xmath7 ( @xcite ) , such that @xmath8 is the energy of escape from the system .",
    "both the mass density @xmath9 and the df @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is a position vector and @xmath12 is a velocity vector ) are related to @xmath13 through poisson s equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gravitational constant .    for the case of an axially symmetric system , it is customary to use cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath16 , where @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath17 . as it is well known , such system admits two isolating integrals for any orbit : the component of the angular momentum about the @xmath18-axis , @xmath19 , and the relative energy @xmath20 .",
    "hence , by the jeans theorem , the df of a steady - state stellar system in an axially symmetric potential can be expressed as a non - negative function of @xmath20 and @xmath21 denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "such df , that vanishes for @xmath23 , is related to the mass density through eq .",
    "( [ int0 ] ) .    in this subject",

    "\\label{dfgen2}\\ ] ] this integral equation was first found by @xcite and then applied by @xcite into calculating the odd df for the binney model , under the assumption of @xmath33 having some realistic rotational laws .",
    "as @xmath33 is not known , we can not compute @xmath34 directly by eq .",
    "( [ dfgen2 ] ) but what we can do is to obtain the most probable distribution functions under some suitable assumptions .",
    "once @xmath31 is known , @xmath25 , and therefore @xmath22 , can be obtained by means of the maximum entropy principle ( see @xcite ) and we obtain @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the parameter depending on the total angular momentum . obviously , @xmath38 . also , the system is non - rotating when @xmath39 and maximally rotating as @xmath40 , i.e. , for @xmath41 , it is anticlockwise and @xmath42f_{+}(\\varepsilon , l_z)$ ] , for @xmath43 , the rotation is clockwise and @xmath44f_{+}(\\varepsilon , l_z)$ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 reflects the rotational characteristics of the system .",
    "as it was pointed out by @xcite and recently by @xcite , the implementation of integral equations ( [ inta2 ] ) and ( [ dfgen2 ] ) demands that one can express @xmath45 as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this holds indeed for the case of disc - like systems , which surface mass density @xmath48 is related to @xmath49 through @xmath50 d\\varepsilon .",
    "\\label{inta3}\\ ] ] in order to incorporate the formalisms developed for the 3-dimensional case to deal with disc - like systems , we have to generate a pseudo - volume density @xmath51 ( @xcite ) , according to @xmath52 which must take the place of @xmath45 in ( [ inta2 ] ) and ( [ dfgen2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , when @xmath53 , the corresponding even df is ( @xcite ) @xmath54 . \\label{jo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    another simpler method to find equilibrium dfs corresponding to axially symmetric disc - like systems , was introduced by @xcite . such formalism deal with dfs that depend on",
    "the jacobi s integral @xmath55 , i.e. the energy measured in a frame rotating with constant angular velocity @xmath56 ( subscript @xmath57 denotes a quantity measured in the rotating frame ) .",
    "it is convenient to define an effective potential @xmath58 in such way that , if we choose a frame in which the velocity distribution is isotropic , the df will be @xmath1-independent and , from ( [ inta3 ] ) , the relation between the surface mass density and the df is reduced to @xmath59 here , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , i.e. the relative potential and the relative energy measured in the rotating frame . moreover , if one can express @xmath48 as a function of @xmath62 , differentiating both sides of ( [ metkal ] ) with respect to @xmath62 , we obtain @xmath63 note that in this formalism it is also necessary to express the mass density as a function of the relative potential .",
    "the generalized kalnajs discs form an infinite family of axially symmetric finite thin discs ( @xcite ) .",

    "such mass distribution generates an axially symmetric gravitational potential , that can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the usual legendre polynomials and the legendre functions of the second kind respectively , and @xmath73 are constants given by @xmath74 where @xmath15 is the gravitational constant . here ,",

    "the formulae showed above defines the relative potentials that will be used to calculate the dfs by the implementation of the methods sketched in section [ sec : finteq ] .",
    "given the mass surface distribution ( [ densidad ] ) and the relative potential ( [ eq:4.22 ] ) , we can easily obtain the following relation : @xmath87 where @xmath88^{1/2}$ ] . as we are dealing with disc - like systems , it is necessary to compute the pseudo - volume density @xmath51 by eq .",

    "( [ jo ] ) with @xmath90 , which is equivalent to calculate the fricke component of ( [ pseudo1 ] ) , we obtain the even part of a df which depends only on the relative energy @xmath91 at this point , we may notice that this @xmath92 corresponds to the df formulated by @xcite when @xmath93 .",
    "( note that there is a difference of constants as a result of a different definition of the relative potential and relative energy . )    to obtain a full df , we use the maximum entropy principle by means of eq .",

    "a similar result can be obtained for @xmath96 , when the probability to find a star with negative @xmath1 decreases as @xmath37 decreases , and the corresponding plots would be analogous to figure [ fig : dfm1a ] , after a reflection about @xmath97 .",
    "we can generalize this result if we perform the analysis in a rotating frame . at first instance",
    ", it is necessary to deal with the effective potential in order to take into account the fictitious forces .",

    "( [ metkal2 ] ) .",

    "nevertheless , this @xmath108 is quiet unrealistic as it represent a state with @xmath109 and it means that the behavior of the system , in disagreement with the observations , behaves like a rigid solid .",
    "however , we can generate a better df if we took only the even part of ( [ dfm1b1 ] ) and using the maximum entropy principle to obtain @xmath110 as it is shown in figure [ fig : dfm1b ] , there is a zone of zero probability , just in the intersection of black zones produced by @xmath111 , and there are also two maximum probability stripes .",
    "the variation of the @xmath56 parameter leads to the change of inclination of the maximum probability stripes and it is easy to see that the df would be invariant under the sign of @xmath56 , by the definition of the even part .",
    "furthermore , @xmath37 plays a similar role than in figure [ fig : dfm1a ] , increasing the probability of finding stars with high @xmath26 as @xmath37 increases and vice versa .      working in a rotating frame we found that the relative potential is given by @xmath113 , \\label{psi21 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] while the surface mass density is given by ( [ densidad ] ) when @xmath112 .",
