    "this paper is motivated by the main result of @xcite which shows that a certain inclusion of infinite iterated crossed product algebras associated to a finite - dimensional hopf algebra @xmath0 is a crossed product by the drinfeld double @xmath2 of @xmath0 .",
    "the hardest step in the proof was the identification of an explicit algebra embedding of @xmath2 into the triple crossed product @xmath3 .",
    "this required the machinery of jones planar algebras to derive ( while verifying it is merely an exercise in sweedler s notation calisthenics ) .",
    "for the rest of the paper , @xmath4 will be an arbitrary algebraically closed field and @xmath5 a finite - dimensional , semisimple and cosemisimple hopf algebra over @xmath4 .",
    "associated to @xmath0 is a planar algebra over @xmath4 denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the algebras @xmath7 and @xmath8 are identified with @xmath4 and for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 as algebras ( where there are @xmath12 alternating factors , and for the natural actions of @xmath1 on @xmath0 and @xmath0 on @xmath1 defined by @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "the embedding of @xmath2 in @xmath3 may therefore be regarded as a map of @xmath15 into @xmath16 .",
    "such maps are interesting for various reasons .",
    "for instance , one such embedding of @xmath2 into the tensor square of @xmath17 is discussed in @xcite and used in @xcite to construct knot invariants in intrinsically three - dimensional terms .",
    "we note that @xmath16 can be naturally regarded as a subalgebra of @xmath18 which can be identified with the tensor square of @xmath17 - both these being matrix algebras over @xmath4 of size @xmath19 .",
    "it is thus a natural question to ask whether the embedding of @xmath2 into @xmath3 may be extended to a planar algebra map in some canonical fashion , and it is the affirmative answer to this question that is one of the main results of our paper .",
    "the other parts of the paper show that this planar algebra map is an embedding and characterise the image .",
    "we review some required preliminaries before stating and proving the main theorem .",
    "the following facts about semisimple and cosemisimple hopf algebras ( over an algebraically closed field @xmath4 ) may be found in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "they are multi - matrix algebras whose dimensions , along with those of their irreducible representations , are invertible in @xmath4 .",
    "the normalised ( to be @xmath20 at the unit ) traces in the left regular representations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be denoted by @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "these are non - degenerate traces and are two - sided integrals , i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for all @xmath25 .",
    "also @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the antipodes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are involutive .",
    "some formulae involving integrals that we will use without explicit mention are @xmath28 and @xmath29 along with the analogous formulae for @xmath1 .",
    "the notion of planar algebras has been evolving since the first paper @xcite .",
    "we elaborate a little on the notion of planar algebras that we use in this paper which is different in some respects from the planar algebras that we have used in our previous work . assuming familiarity with some notion of planar algebras",
    ", we will be brief - see @xcite for a more leisurely discussion of the older version of planar algebras and @xcite for the newer version .",
    "recall that the coloured operad of planar tangles underlies planar algebras .",
    "consider the set @xmath30 , elements of which we refer to as colours .",
    "we will typically write a colour as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is either @xmath33 or @xmath34 and stands for @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "a tangle is a subset of the plane that is the complement of the union of the interiors of a ( possibly empty ) finite numbered collection of internal discs in an external disc , along with the following data .",
    "each disc has an even number ( again , possibly 0 ) of points marked on its boundary circles .",
    "there is also given a collection of disjoint curves on the tangle each of which is either a simple closed curve , or joins a marked point on one of the circles to another such , cutting each transversally .",
    "each marked point on a disc must be the end - point of one of the curves .",
    "for each disc , one of its boundary arcs (= connected components of the complement of the marked points on the boundary circle ) is distinguished and marked with a @xmath37 placed near it .",
    "finally , there is given a chequerboard shading of the regions (= connected components of the complement of the curves ) such that across any curve , the shading toggles .",
    "a disc with @xmath38 points on its boundary is said to be an @xmath39 disc or an @xmath40 disc according as its @xmath37-arc abuts a white or black region .",
    "a tangle is said to be an @xmath41-tangle if its external disc is of colour @xmath41 .",
    "tangles are defined only up to a planar isotopy preserving the @xmath37-arcs , the shading and the numbering of the internal discs . as is usual",
    ", we will often refer to and draw the discs as boxes with their * -arcs being their leftmost arc and sometimes omit drawing the external disc / box .",
    "two basic operations that can be performed on tangles are that of renumbering the internal discs or of substitution of one tangle into a disc of another , and the collection of tangles along with these operations is called the coloured operad of planar tangles .",
    "a planar algebra @xmath42 is an algebra over this operad .",
    "thus @xmath42 is a collection ( i ) of vector spaces indexed by @xmath43 and ( ii ) linear maps @xmath44 indexed by tangles , with the maps being compatible with renumbering and substitution and satisfying the so - called non - degeneracy axiom",
    ".    we will refer to planar algebras in the older sense as restricted planar algebras . for these ,",
    "the set of colours is the subset @xmath45 , all discs ( with the exception of @xmath46-discs ) have @xmath37-arcs abutting white regions and @xmath42 is a collection of vector spaces indexed only by the subset above .",
    "clearly , a planar algebra naturally yields a restricted planar algebra ( which we will refer to as its restriction ) in the obvious manner .",
    "the converse holds too in the following categorical form - see remark 3.6 of @xcite ( which treats the case when @xmath42 has modulus ) .",
    "[ restricted ] let @xmath47 be a restricted planar algebra .",
    "there exists a planar algebra @xmath42 with restriction isomorphic to @xmath47 .",
    "further @xmath42 is unique in the sense that if @xmath48 and @xmath49 are planar algebras with restrictions",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 that are isomorphic ( as restricted planar algebras ) by the map @xmath52 , then , there exists a unique planar algebra isomorphism @xmath53 that restricts to @xmath54 .    for existence ,",
    "given @xmath47 , construct @xmath42 as follows .",
    "define @xmath55 and for @xmath56 , set @xmath57 .    to define the action by tangles ,",
    "first consider for every colour @xmath31 , the tangle @xmath58 which is defined to be the identity tangle of colour @xmath31 if @xmath59 and to be the one - rotation tangle with an internal disc of colour @xmath60 and external disc of colour @xmath61 otherwise . also consider the tangle @xmath62 which is defined to be the identity tangle of colour @xmath31 if @xmath59 and to be the inverse one - rotation tangle with an internal disc of colour @xmath61 and external disc of colour @xmath60 otherwise .    now , for a @xmath63-tangle @xmath64 with internal discs of colours @xmath65 , define @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "it is then easy to see that this defines a planar algebra structure on @xmath42 ( with restriction @xmath47 ) , the main observation being that @xmath68 is the identity tangle of colour @xmath31 .    for uniqueness of @xmath42 ,",
    "suppose that @xmath69 are planar algebras with restrictions @xmath70 and @xmath52 is a restricted planar algebra isomorphism .",
    "we need to see the existence and uniqueness of a unique planar algebra isomorphism @xmath71 that restricts to @xmath54 .",
    "the uniqueness of @xmath72 is because , given a colour @xmath61 with @xmath73 , the equation @xmath74 , must hold and @xmath75 is an isomorphism for any planar algebra @xmath42 . as for existence ,",
    "define @xmath76 by the same equation and check that this indeed gives a planar algebra isomorphism that restricts to @xmath54 .",
    "next , we recall the construction from @xcite of the planar algebra @xmath77 associated to @xmath0 .",
    "this depends on the choice of a square root , denoted @xmath78 , of @xmath79 in @xmath80 , which we will assume has been made and is fixed throughout .",
    "the planar algebra @xmath77 is then defined to be the quotient of the universal planar algebra on the label set @xmath81 by the set of relations in figures [ fig : lnrmdl ] - [ fig : xchntp ] .    in these figures , note that the shading is such that all the 2-boxes that occur are of colour @xmath82 .",
    "also note that the modulus relation is a pair of relations - one for each choice of shading the circle .",
    "finally , note that the interchange of @xmath78 and @xmath83 between the ( i ) and ( t ) relations here and those of @xcite is due to the different normalisations of @xmath22 and @xmath21 .",
    "the main result of @xcite then asserts that @xmath77 is a connected , irreducible , spherical , non - degenerate planar algebra with modulus @xmath78 and is of depth two with @xmath84 for every @xmath85 .",
    "the word ` non - degenerate ' here refers not to the non - degeneracy axiom ( which must hold for any planar algebra ) but to the condition that the trace tangles for each colour specify non - degenerate traces .      for any positive integer @xmath86 ,",
    "consider the ` operation @xmath87 on tangles ' given by @xmath86-cabling .",
    "some care is needed in defining this for tangles involving @xmath31 boxes with @xmath88 .",
    "take the tangle @xmath64 , ignore its shading and thicken every strand to a cable of @xmath86 parallel strands without changing the @xmath37 s .",
    "now introduce shading in the result such that any @xmath31 box of @xmath64 changes to a @xmath89 box of @xmath90 .",
    "a little thought shows that this does give a consistent chequerboard shading as needed . for a detailed definition of ` operation on tangles ' ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this gives an operation on planar algebras @xmath91 . here ,",
    "the planar algebra @xmath92 = @xmath47 , say , is defined by setting the vector spaces @xmath93 to be @xmath94 and the action @xmath95 of a tangle @xmath64 on @xmath47 to be @xmath96 .",
    "in this paper we will only be interested in the @xmath97-cabling of a planar algebra @xmath42 whose spaces are specified by @xmath98 for any @xmath99 .      for a finite - dimensional hopf algebra @xmath0 ,",
    "its drinfeld double , denoted @xmath2 , is the hopf algebra with underlying vector space @xmath100 and multiplication , comultiplication and antipode specified by the following formulae : @xmath101    as in @xcite what we will actually use is an isomorphic version of @xmath2 which we denote @xmath102 which also has underlying vector space @xmath100 and structure maps obtained by transporting the structures on @xmath2 using the invertible map @xmath103 .",
    "it is easily checked that the structure maps for @xmath102 are given by the following formulae . @xmath104    the unit and counit of @xmath102 are given by @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively .",
    "if @xmath0 is semisimple and cosemisimple , there are normalised two - sided integrals @xmath107 and @xmath108 , and in particular , @xmath2 is both semisimple and cosemisimple .",
    "also , in this case , since the antipode @xmath109 is involutive , there is no distinction between @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
