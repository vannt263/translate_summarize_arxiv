    "the pentaquarks have been discussed in the literature since more than 30 years .",
    "light and heavy pentaquarks have alternatively been predicted and searched for .",
    "the present wave of interest came with the observation of a narrow resonance , called @xmath1 , of mass @xmath2 mev and width @xmath3 mev , by the leps collaboration at the end of 2002 @xcite .",
    "this was interpreted as a light pentaquark of content @xmath4 following the 1997 predictions of diakonov , petrov and polyakov @xcite ( for some other pioneering work see @xcite ) .",
    "the leps experiment has been followed by the observation of another narrow resonance , called @xmath5 , m @xmath6 1862 mev , @xmath7 18 mev , by the na49 collaboration @xcite , interpreted as a pentaquark of content @xmath8 and supposed to be also a member of the antidecuplet of @xmath1 . in march 2004 a narrow heavy resonance ,",
    "@xmath9 3100 mev , @xmath7 12 mev , has been observed by the h1 collaboration @xcite and was interpreted as a heavy pentaquark of content @xmath10 .",
    "the pentaquark @xmath1 needs more solid confirmation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) while the other observations remain much more controversial .",
    "( for a historical note on pentaquarks see e. g. @xcite )",
    "presently there is a large variety of approaches to pentaquarks : the chiral soliton or the skyrme model , the constituent quark model , the instanton model , qcd sum rules , lattice calculations , etc .",
    "the main issues are the determination of spin and parity , the decay width , the splitting between the isomultiplets belonging to the same irreducible representation of su(3)@xmath0 and the effect of representations mixing on the masses and widths of pentaquarks .",
    "here i shall refer to pentaqurk studies in constituent quark models only .",
    "the constituent quark models describe a large number of observables in baryon spectroscopy ( masses , formfactors , decay widths , etc ) and it therefore seems quite natural to look at its predictions for exotics .",
    "the most common constituent quark models have either a spin - color ( cs ) or a spin - flavor ( fs ) hyperfine interaction .",
    "one can also have a superposition of cs and fs interactions in the so - called hybrid models ( see below ) .",
    "the present talk focuses mainly on a dynamical study of the light pentaquark antidecuplet and the charmed antisextet based on the fs interaction .",
    "details of this study can be found in refs .",
    "the calculations are based on the model hamiltonian of ref.@xcite , which represents a realistic form of the more schematic model of ref .",
    "chronologically the model hamiltonian @xcite has been first applied to the description of heavy pentaquarks of both negative @xcite and positive parity @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the positive parity pentaquarks were much lighter ( few hundreds of mev ) than the negative parity ones at a fixed @xmath11 content , where @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "the parity can be found by looking at the @xmath14 subsystem .",
    "the lowest negative parity state with spin @xmath15 comes from a @xmath14 subsystem which has the structure @xmath16_o [ 211]_c [ 211]_{oc};[211]_f [ 22]_s [ 31]_{fs } \\rangle$ ] .",
    "this means that there is no orbital excitation and the parity of the pentaquark is the same as that of the antiquark .",
    "if one quark is excited to the p - shell which implies a positive parity for the pentaquark , the pauli principle allows the @xmath14 subsystem to have the structure @xmath17_o [ 211]_c [ 1111]_{oc};[22]_f [ 22]_s [ 4]_{fs } \\rangle$ ] in its lowest state .",
    "although this state contains one unit of orbital excitation the attraction brought by the fs interaction when @xmath14 is in its most symmetric state @xmath18_{fs}$ ] is so strong that it overcomes the excess of kinetic energy and generates a positive parity state much below the negative parity one .    besides giving a good description of non - strange and strange baryon spectra , by bringing the roper resonance below the first negative parity state and describing well other baryon properties ( see   e. g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the flavor - spin interaction has support from qcd lattice calculations on baryons which suggests that the observed level order of positive and negative parity is an effect of the lightness of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 quark masses .",
    "moreover the flavor - spin is a symmetry consistent with the large @xmath21 limit of qcd .    in cs models the lowest positive parity state for @xmath1 , with one unit of orbital excitation has symmetry @xmath22_{cs}$ ] in the relevant degrees of freedom . even for this symmetry , which is the",
    "lowest allowed one , the hyperfine interaction is not strong enough to overcome the excess of kinetic energy , so that the lowest state acquires negative parity in realistic models @xcite",
    ". for various reasons , hybrid models also favor negative parity @xcite .",
    "in su(3)@xmath0 a pentaquark state , described as a @xmath23 system can be obtained from the direct product @xmath24 which shows that the antidecuplet @xmath25 is one of the possible multiplets .",
    "the su(3)@xmath0 breaking induces representation mixing .",
    "one expects an important mixing between octet members and antidecuplet members with the same quantum numbers .",
    "this holds for @xmath26 and 1 .",
    "the results for the mass spectra of @xmath25 and @xmath27 pentaquarks and their mixing based on the model of ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in fig . 1 . here , as in any other model",
    "including the chiral soliton , one can not determine the absolute mass of @xmath1 .",
    "this mass has been fitted to the presently accepted experimental value of 1540 mev .",
    "reasons to accommodate such a value are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . the pure @xmath25 spectrum , fig .",
    "1a , can approximately be described by the linear mass formula @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hypercharge .",
    "this result is compared to the antidecuplet spectrum of ref .",
    "@xcite ,  fig . 1c , where @xmath30 , which implies larger spacing than in the fs model .",
    "presently the level spacing in the chiral soliton model is estimated to be smaller @xcite , thus closer to the fs model result .    as a consequence of the su(3)@xmath0 breaking the representations @xmath25 and @xmath27 mix and",
    "accordingly the physical states are defined as @xmath31 for @xmath32 and similarly for @xmath33 .",
    "1b shows the masses of the physical states @xmath34 obtained from this mixing @xmath25 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the mixing angles @xmath35 and @xmath36 are calculated dynamically in this approach , by using the coupling matrix element of @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "this has combined contributions from all the parts of the hamiltonian which break su(3)@xmath0 symmetry : the free mass term , the kinetic energy and the hyperfine interaction , see ref .",
    "interestingly , the combined contribution leads in practice to an ideal mixing .",
    "one obtains @xmath37 , as compared to the ideal mixing angle @xmath38 and @xmath39 as compared to @xmath40 .    by the definition ( [ physn ] ) ,",
    "@xmath41 is the `` mainly octet '' state and @xmath34 is the `` mainly antidecuplet '' state . from the calculated mixing angle",
    "it follows that the former is approximately 67 % octet and the latter 67 % antidecuplet .",
    "the above mixing angle implies that @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "then , for example , for positive charge pentaquarks with @xmath44 = 1/2 one has @xmath45",
    "i. e. the  mainly octet \" has no strangeness and the `` mainly antidecuplet '' state contains the whole available amount of ( hidden ) strangeness .",
    "the `` mainly octet '' nucleon state @xmath41 acquires the mass m(n@xmath46 ) @xmath47 = 1451 mev and for the `` mainly octet '' @xmath33 state one obtains m(@xmath48 ) @xmath47 = 2046 mev . in the nucleon case this implies that there are two resonances in the roper mass region : one which is obtained in the original calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite as a radial excited state of structure @xmath49 and mass 1495 mev and the other the pentaquark state at 1451 mev",
    ". a mixing of @xmath49 and @xmath23 could be a better description of the reality .",
    "there is some experimental evidence @xcite that two resonances instead of one can consistently describe the @xmath50 and the @xmath51 scattering in the roper resonance region 1430 - 1470 mev .",
    "[ figure1 ]",
    "in most models which accommodate @xmath1 and its antidecuplet partners , heavy pentaquarks @xmath11 can be accommodated as well , being in principle more stable against strong decays than the light pentaquarks @xcite . in an su(4 )",
    "classification , including charm , it has been shown @xcite that the light antidecuplet containing @xmath1 and a charm antisextet with @xmath52 replaced by @xmath53 belong to the same su(4 ) irreducible representation of dimension 60 .",
    "[ figure2 ]    the masses of the charmed antisextet calculated in the fs model @xcite are presented in fig .",
    "they are compared to the only qcd lattice calculations @xcite which predict positive parity for the lowest states .",
    "although the two calculations have an entirely different basis the masses of @xmath54 of content @xmath55 and of @xmath56 of content @xmath57 are quite similar . only for @xmath58 of content @xmath59 a mass difference of 250 mev appears .",
    "however , by taking into account the lattice calculations numerical uncertainty of approximately @xmath60 100 mev , the two results look closer to each other . the experimental observation of charmed pentaquarks is contradictory so far .",
    "while the h1 collaboration @xcite brought evidence for a narrow resonance at about 3100 mev , there is null evidence from zeus or the cdf collaborations @xcite .    for an orientation , in connection to future experiments , it is interesting to calculate excited charmed pentaquarks @xmath61 . in the fs model used above the first excited",
    "state having @xmath62 and @xmath15 appears 200 mev above @xmath63 which has @xmath64 .",
    "this supports the large spacing result obtained approximately in ref .",
    "@xcite for the fs model .",
    "the recent research activity on pentaquarks could bring a substantial progress in understanding the baryon structure . it could help to shed a new light on some resonances difficult to understand , as e. g. the roper or the @xmath65 baryon .",
    "the wave functions of such baryons may have substantial higher fock components .",
    "furthermore , in light hadrons it is important to understand the role of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , the basic feature of the chiral soliton model @xcite which motivated this new wave of interest in pentaquarks .",
    "it is thought that the fs model used here has its origin in the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry as well @xcite .",
    "an important common feature of the two models is that they both lead to positive parity for the light antidecuplet .",
    "if ever measured , the parity of @xmath1 could disentangle between various models .",
    "also a clear theoretical understanding of the production mechanism of light and heavy pentaquarks is necessary .",
    "the experiments , which see or not see the pentaquarks , need a clear explanation .",
