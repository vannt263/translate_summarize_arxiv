    "the properties of the production and the absorption of quarkonium in proton(deuteron)-nucleus collisions , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 suppression in @xmath2au collisions at rhic , offer the opportunity to study cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects in the nuclear medium .",
    "this is of particular relevance for the understanding of qcd at high density and temperature in nucleus - nucleus collisions , since it is in fact adventurous to claim that the charmonium family is a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) thermometer @xcite without calibrating first the cnm suppression .",
    "we have studied the impact of different cold nuclear matter effects both on @xmath0 and @xmath1 production , namely the survival probability for a bound state to escape the nucleus _",
    "the nuclear absorption _ and the modification of the gluon distribution in bound nucleons _",
    "gluon shadowing_. alternative mechanisms such as _ saturation _ and _ fractional",
    "energy loss _ are also considered .",
    "we have then discussed whether these cnm effects could explain ( or not ) the data on @xmath0 and @xmath1 within a coherent picture .",
    "we have paid a special attention to the recent phenix preliminary data @xcite on @xmath1 production in @xmath2au collisions at @xmath3 gev , which show a strong suppression for central collisions in the mid - rapidity region .",
    "the probability for the heavy - quark pair to be broken up in the propagation through the nuclear medium is commonly known as the nuclear absorption .",
    "it is usually parametrised by an effective break - up cross section  @xmath4 .    in principle",
    ", the larger size of the @xmath1 compared to the @xmath0 tells us that the @xmath1 should suffer more break - up than the @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to remember that the relevant timescale to analyse the pair evolution is its formation time , which , following the uncertainty principle , is related to the time needed  in their rest frame  to distinguish the energy levels of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states , @xmath7 gev / 4 gev@xmath8 fm for the @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , @xmath10 has to be considered in the rest frame of the target nucleus , _",
    "i.e. _  the au beam at rhic",
    ". the boost factor @xmath11 is obtained from the rapidity of the pair corrected by the au beam rapidity @xmath12 where @xmath13 for rhic .",
    "note that in the backward rapidity region @xmath14 is always above @xmath15 the maximum momentum fraction below which parton saturation can be considered . in the mid and forward rapidity regions , the saturation scale is always below the typical energy scale of the process , namely @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , in the mid - rapidity region the ratio of @xmath18 to the @xmath9 mass is @xmath19 , which makes unlikely the possibility of specific saturation effects . only in the most forward rapidity region",
    "there is a small probability for phenomena beyond collinear factorisation _",
    "i.e. _  beyond those encoded in the npdfs",
    ". moreover , these effects if they exist would suppress the @xmath0 slightly more than the @xmath1 , in contradiction to the experimental results .",
    "recently , the possibility of a medium - induced energy loss that scales with the energy @xmath20 has been pointed out @xcite . this _",
    "fractional _ energy loss would affect the heavy - quark pair produced in a coloured state provided that it has long enough time to radiate .",
    "the fraction of medium - induced radiated energy is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the broadening of the radiated gluon from the proton and @xmath23 is the transverse mass of the final - state coloured object .",
    "if 100% of the @xmath9 s were produced in a coloured state at rhic , @xmath24 .",
    "assuming that the corresponding suppression factor is just the ratio between the pdf of the gluon evaluated at its original @xmath25 , @xmath26 before the loss and the pdf at the resulting @xmath27 : @xmath28 .",
    "taking modern global - fit gluon pdfs , we find that this _ fractional energy loss _ could give an extra suppression of the order of 10% in the mid - rapidity region and up to 15% in the forward region .",
    "note that this suppression only applies when the @xmath9 is produced in a coloured state , and that its effect is similar in @xmath0 and @xmath1 production due to their similar masses would lead to a smaller value of @xmath29 , which is compensated by an increase of the mean value of @xmath27 when compared to the @xmath0 case .",
    "this makes the quantitative difference between the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 indistinguishable . ] .",
    "thus , this can not explain the experimental found either .",
    "0.3 cm in conclusion , we have studied different cnm effects and their impact on @xmath0 and @xmath1 production .",
    "we have shown that , at rhic energies and in the mid - rapidity region , the results from the four cnm effects which we investigated , namely an effective nuclear absorption , the gluon shadowing , the gluon saturation and a fractional energy loss , impact similarly the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 , in contradiction to the recent phenix preliminary data on @xmath1 production in @xmath2au collisions at 200 gev .",
    "the abovementioned effects should be taken into account in the interpretation of the upcoming lhc data on @xmath0 and @xmath1 production .",
