    "coexistence between bacteria and bacteriophages gives rise to a variety of strategies each organism uses to exploit weaknesses of another .",
    "in particular , while virulent phages always kill their host by lysing or breaking it open , temperate phages can choose between such lytic strategy and entering dormant or lysogenic state in which their host is maintained nearly intact .",
    "while many biomolecular mechanisms regulating lytic - to - lysogenic transition are well understood , there is no clear agreement on environmental properties favoring virulent over temperate phage strategy . also , currently there is no general theoretical framework relating the frequency of lysogeny for temperate phages to contemporary environmental conditions .",
    "here we address both questions using the classical bet - hedging strategy first introduced by kelly .",
    "our analysis shows that the best long - term growth rate of the phage population is achieved by kelly - optimal or `` well - tempered '' strategy from our title with lysogenization frequency approximately equal to the probability of lytic subpopulation collapse .",
    "the fitness advantage of this optimized strategy over purely virulent one can be expressed in terms of a relative information entropy .",
    "we predict sharp transitions between optimal virulent , temperate , and dormant ( purely lysogenic ) strategies as a function of environmental , ecological , and biophysical parameters of the system .",
    "in particular , purely virulent strategy is shown to work best for phages with large diversity of hosts , and access to multiple independent environments reachable by diffusion .",
    "conversely , temperate or dormant strategies are favored in environments subject to frequent and severe temporal downturns .",
    "bacteria and their main predators , bacteriophages @xcite , are the most abundant and dynamic part of the biosphere @xcite .",
    "phages lead a risky lifestyle @xcite and as a consequence local populations of individual phage species routinely experience extreme fluctuations caused by changes in availability of susceptible hosts @xcite . in real ecosystems these fluctuations",
    "may be caused e.g. by depletion of nutrients for hosts , development of host resistance , and interference from competing phages @xcite or other bacterial predators .",
    "phages deal with these challenges using a variety of strategies @xcite .",
    "one common strategy adopted by virulent phages is to always kill and lyse their host resulting in release of 100 - 3000 progeny phages @xcite .",
    "sustainability of this strategy is critically dependent on phages ability to reach susceptible hosts @xcite because free phage particles have a finite lifetime @xcite .",
    "in contrast , temperate phages following the infection of a bacterium can opt for a transition to the lysogenic state where the future fate of the incorporated prophage is aligned with that of its bacterial hosts .",
    "@xcite suggested that the temperate strategy may persist because it allows phages to survive extended periods when host density is below the level needed to sustain the propagation of the lytic population ( pure virulent strategy ) .",
    "campbell @xcite considered the sustainability of pure virulent strategy , noting that it strongly depends on the growth rate of the phages bacterial host relative to that of other competing bacteria in the same local environment .",
    "thus , any changes in the environment affecting the relative ranking of bacteria by their growth rate will likely impact the local success of lytic phages infecting these bacteria @xcite .",
    "the lysogenic state of temperate phages allows them to weather out severe downturns in environmental conditions @xcite .",
    "however , it comes at the cost of some reduction in the growth rate of the lytic subpopulation .",
    "it is hence plausible that temperate phages should try to optimize the ratio of their populations in lytic and lysogenic states in order to achieve the maximal long - term growth rate . to quantify this process we consider a local phage population living in a fluctuating environment characterized by sudden unpredictable downturns , a scenario inspired by the classical paper by kelly @xcite on application of information theory to gambling . like gamblers @xcite or financial investors @xcite phages must decide what part of their population `` capital '' to allocate to a `` risky '' lytic state which has the potential for rapid growth but is also subject to a non - negligible risk of sudden collapse .",
    "the rest of the population `` capital '' will be allocated to the relatively `` safe '' lysogenic state .",
    "here we aim to quantify the parameters of the long - term optimal or `` well - temperate '' phage strategy and compare its outcome to a purely virulent strategy .",
    "our calculations are inspired by the original work by kelly @xcite , its applications to finance @xcite and evolution @xcite .",
    "similar bet - hedging approaches have been explored to germination of seeds from annual plants @xcite .",
    "as is common for bet - hedging in population biology , our analysis goes beyond optimization of the outcome of individual infection on a short - time scale , and instead considers the long - term ( logarithmic ) growth rate @xcite .",
    "consider a local phage population that grows or declines in fluctuating environmental conditions .",
    "the environment is assumed to randomly switch between  good \" conditions favoring multiplicative growth of the lytic subpopulation and `` bad '' conditions during which local lytic subpopulation completely ( or partially as will be investigated later in this study ) dies out .",
    "rapid growth during good conditions is quantified by the amplification factor @xmath2 .",
    "we assume bad conditions to be transient events of indefinite duration that occur with the probability @xmath3 . during good environmental conditions",
    "one time step of our model roughly corresponds to one phage generation which in turn makes @xmath4 bounded from above by phage s burst size .",
    "conversely , during bad environmental conditions we count the entire duration of this event as a single time step .    temperate phages in our model have no predictive knowledge of when their environment is about to turn bad .",
    "however , they are free to choose what fraction @xmath5 of their population will be kept in the lysogenic state at every time step . notice that because only during new infections by phages from the lytic subpopulation they are free to chose between lytic and lysogenic states , our model is based on the assumption that the majority of phages are of this type .",
    "this assumption is justified in case of rapid exponential growth when the lysogenization frequency during the last `` good '' time - step approximately determines the lysogenic fraction @xmath5 for the entire population . in the simplest scenario considered in this chapter",
    "we also assume that the local lysogenic subpopulation is fully protected from the extreme changes in the local environment and does not change with time . later on in this study",
    "we will relax this assumption and allow the lysogenic population to be characterized by a time - independent growth ( or decline ) rate .",
    "in fact the growth rate of the lytic subpopulation is always defined _ relative _ to that of the lysogenic subpopulation much in the same way as in financial markets risky asset returns are always compared to interest rates paid by banks .",
    "the expected value of the ( logarithmic ) growth rate @xmath6 of the entire local phage population in our model is given by @xmath7+p \\log x \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] the first term is the logarithmic growth rate under good conditions when the lytic fraction @xmath8 of the total population is multiplied by @xmath4 , while the lysogenic subpopulation @xmath5 remains unchanged .",
    "the second term is the logarithmic growth rate under bad conditions when only phages in the lysogenic state survive . later on",
    "we will relax the requirement that the entire lytic population has to completely die off during bad times .",
    "the growth rate considered above weights the _ logarithms _ of multiplicative growth factors of the entire phage population under two conditions with their respective probabilities of occurrence .",
    "maximization of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath5 secures the long - term optimal growth rate @xcite .",
    "this should not be confused with optimization of the expected ( average ) population growth after just one or a small number of growth cycles .",
    "such short - term optimization would always favor purely lytic strategy with @xmath9 provided that @xmath10 .",
    "the last condition is almost always fulfilled since during good times @xmath4 approaches its upper bound given by the average burst size which is substantially larger than one offspring per phage . on the other hand , following the lytic strategy for a long time would almost certainly bring the phage population to the total collapse , which will happen during the very first bad time interval .",
    "in contrast to its short - term counterpart , the long - term logarithmic growth rate @xmath11 usually reaches its maximum at some @xmath12 between 0 and 1 . in the economics literature",
    "it is referred to as kelly - optimal investment ratio @xcite .",
    "it describes the optimal fraction of capital that a prudent long - term investor should keep in relatively safe financial assets such as bonds or bank deposits while investing the rest in more risky assets such as stocks @xcite . in our biological interpretation @xmath12",
    "corresponds to the optimal fraction of the phage population in the lysogenic state . at the kelly - optimum the derivative of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath5 is equal to zero , which is realized at @xmath13 this equation is nearly identical to the eq . 8 in @xcite which expresses the optimal germination frequency of plant seeds in environments where bad years would eliminate all germinated seeds .",
    "furthermore , the positive correlation between @xmath12 and the frequency of environmental fluctuations @xmath14 predicted by the eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] was confirmed by the empirical data on seed germination @xcite .",
    "before we proceed with analysis and modifications of our model we would like to highlight the main approximations / simplifications used throughout this study .",
    "our first approximation is the use of the kelly theory , which implicitly assumes stochastic exponential growth .",
    "thus in our simplified two - state model we ignore the ( very real ) dynamical feedback between populations of phages and their bacterial hosts as the former approach and ultimately reach steady state equilibrium .",
    "such feedback in a system consisting of two types of phages ( temperate and virulent ) and one type of bacterial host ( with susceptible , lysogenic , and resistant subpopulations ) subject to variable nutrients was analyzed in a classic paper @xcite .",
    "stewart and levin also compared purely virulent and temperate phage strategies in the steady - state of this closed system and reached general conclusions , which are in qualitative agreement with our predictions : `` lysogeny is an adaptation for phage to maintain their populations in `` hard times '' , when the host bacterial density oscillates below that necessary for phage to be maintained by lytic infection alone . '' here we confirm this prediction using a very different approach , and expand it by calculating the optimal lysogenic fraction of a temperate phage . later on",
    "we will generalize our simplified two - state model characterized by the generic `` good '' or `` bad '' conditions to a multi - state model in which the current growth rate @xmath15 is drawn from an arbitrary ( even continuous ) probability distribution .",
    "this variant of the model in principle allows us to consider the slowdown or even reversal in the growth rate of the phage population following the dynamical trajectory derived in ref .",
    "indeed , in our model we can represent this trajectory by the corresponding distribution of instantaneous growth rates @xmath15 .",
    "abrupt downturns ( `` bad times '' ) in our model are caused by external events , such as e.g. invasions of new predators or emergence of resistant strains , ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition , the negative feedback between populations of the phage and its bacterial host @xcite can cause dramatic short term changes in the lytic growth rate .",
    "the last approximation behind the eq .",
    "1 is that  bad - times \" are treated as singular events of undetermined duration , thereby ignoring the topic of the optimal rate for lysogen induction .",
    "we employ this simplification because the lysogenic state represents a long term commitment that can be broken only due to rare stochastic fluctuations or excessive dna damage of the host @xcite .",
    "this simplification is well justified for @xmath16 when the vast majority of phages were created during the previous time - step and thus the lysogenization frequency during this step directly determines the lysogenic fraction @xmath5 of the entire population . therefore , in this study we focus exclusively on the choice between lytic and lysogenic states during the infection , and not on the small spontaneous release of lytic phages from lysogens ( of order @xmath17 per generation per bacteria for phage @xmath18 @xcite ) . a more extended and general formalism allowing for discussion of both entry and exit rates in two - state phenotypic model can be found in @xcite .",
    "phages are known to combine stochastic and regulated strategies for entry to lysogeny in response to a variety of external and internal signals @xcite .",
    "one example of such strategic response is provided by an increase in lysogenization frequency @xcite in response to reduced burst size when phages infect bacteria in a starved or stationary state @xcite . here",
    "the short term optimization criterion would predict full virulence as long as @xmath19 , whereas the long term optimization ( eq .",
    "2 ) would suggest a gradual increase of the optimal lysogeny frequency @xmath12 as @xmath4 is reduced and/or @xmath14 increases . in this study",
    "we do not consider the question of how phages can keep the lysogenic fraction of their population as close as possible to its kelly - optimal value @xmath12 .",
    "instead we concentrate on how @xmath20 itself depends on environmental and biophysical parameters .      to simplify our calculations",
    ", above we assumed that during bad times the entire lytic phage population dies off and that the lysogenic subpopulation does not change at all .",
    "both assumptions can be relaxed by assuming a small but finite multiplicative ratio @xmath21 quantifying the collapse ( but not complete extinction ) of the lytic subpopulation during bad times .",
    "we also introduce the new parameter @xmath18 for the growth ( or decline ) rate of the lysogenic subpopulation defined by the replication rate of their bacterial hosts . the mathematical approach developed in our study",
    "requires @xmath18 to stay constant during both good and bad times in contrast to dramatic changes in growth rates of the lytic subpopulation .    in this more general case of our two - state model the logarithmic growth rate of the entire phage population",
    "is given by @xmath22+p \\cdot \\log[(1-x)\\omega + x\\lambda]$ ] and the kelly - optimal lysogenic fraction is given by ( see appendix for derivation).the @xmath23    the important new result is the existence of a finite threshold for transition between purely lytic ( virulent ) and mixed lytic - lysogenic ( temperate ) strategies of phages .",
    "assuming ( quite realistically ) that @xmath3 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 one gets the approximative relation @xmath26 , which predicts that a purely lytic strategy with @xmath27 is optimal when @xmath28 in other words , virulent phages thrive when the probability of environmental downturns ( @xmath14 ) is smaller than the relative impact of such downturns on lytic and lysogenic subpopulations ( @xmath29 ) . on the opposite end of the spectra the growth advantage of the lytic over the lysogenic state under good conditions shrinks as @xmath4 is decreased until it becomes comparable to @xmath18 .",
    "in this case phages ( as smart investors ) should allocate progressively larger portion of their population `` capital '' to the safety of the lysogenic state .",
    "when the time - averaged growth rate of a purely lytic population is less or equal than that of a purely lysogenic one , @xmath30 , the kelly - optimal lysogenic fraction is equal to 1 instructing phages to permanently abandon the lytic strategy e.g. by transferring their genomes to plasmids . in between these two extremes , for moderate likelihoods of bad times @xmath14 , and substantial good times lytic growth rates @xmath4 , the temperate strategy will win .",
    "thus the  well - temperate phage \" from our title is the one whose lysogenization frequency within the duration of a lytic burst cycle is approximately equal to the likelihood of the lytic population collapse : @xmath31 .",
    "the plot of the kelly - optimal lysogenic fraction @xmath20 as a function of the probability - @xmath14 and the severity - @xmath32 of population collapses during bad times is shown in fig . [ figure2 ] .",
    "one can further generalize our model from two - state environments to multiple or even continuous state environments . in this model the lytic population growth rate @xmath15 during a given time - interval @xmath33 is drawn from an arbitrary probability distribution @xmath34 .",
    "the two - state model considered above corresponds to @xmath35 .    in the appendix",
    "we prove the existence of a unique kelly - optimal strategy which is @xmath36    here @xmath37 denotes the long - term time average calculated using @xmath34 . when @xmath38 ( eq . [ dormant_conditions",
    "] ) there is no growth advantage of being lytic and hence the optimal choice is for the entire phage population to go dormant into the lysogenic state : @xmath39 . on the other hand , when @xmath40 ( eq . [ virulent_conditions ] ) ,",
    "the frequency and severity of lytic population collapses is not sufficient to justify even a marginal investment into `` safe '' lysogenic state .",
    "hence the optimal choice in this limit is for the entire phage population to remain lytic : @xmath27 . in between these two extreme scenarios",
    "the temperate strategy is optimal ( eq . [ temperate_conditions ] ) , and , as shown in the appendix , the `` well - temperate '' ( kelly - optimal ) lysogenic ratio @xmath12 is determined by numerical solution to @xmath41    if the lysogenic subpopulation was completely stable , one would have the following paradox : the growth in the kelly - optimal solution can only be larger or equal than the lysogenic growth rate @xmath18 .",
    "thus , for @xmath42 , the optimal temperate strategy would necessarily be non - stationary .",
    "this paradox does not exist if @xmath43 .",
    "such smaller growth of lysogenized hosts is in fact expected due to either cost of integrated prophages ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for quantitative estimates ) or predation of lysogens by other types of phages . in this case",
    "we expect the entire phage population to self - organize into a stationary state where over the longest times scale it neither shrinks nor grows : @xmath44 \\rangle = 0 $ ] .",
    "besides previously discussed factors such as the frequency and the severity of environmental collapses , the choice between virulent and temperate strategies depends also on phages ability to access ( e.g. by diffusion ) multiple spatially - separated environments , which are fluctuating independently of each other .",
    "in general , the access to multiple independently fluctuating environments favors the virulent strategy , in much the same was as the access to a well - diversified investment portfolio consisting of multiple independently fluctuating stocks reduces investor s risk exposure @xcite and tempts to move his / her capital out of the safety of a low interest bank deposit .",
    "analogous trends have been reported @xcite for seed germination of plants , also suggesting that the fast growing but risky strategy wins when offsprings can be spread between many independently fluctuating environments .    for phage populations ,",
    "as their access to multiple independent environments increases , hedging of bets by the lysogeny becomes progressively less and less important .",
    "eventually , in the limit of a large number of strongly interconnected environments one expects the purely lytic ( virulent ) strategy to win over any temperate strategy .    to quantify this common sense prediction in terms of phage biophysics and environmental parameters ,",
    "we mathematically consider the case where the diffusion connects phage populations in @xmath45 of independent yet statistically identical environments .",
    "we assume that at every time - step the diffusion distributes a fraction @xmath46 of the entire phage population equally across all environments .    generally speaking , in the multi - environment model the diffusion constant @xmath47 takes the role of the collapse ratio @xmath32 in the single - environment model .",
    "indeed , during severe environmental downturns when the entire lytic subpopulation is lost it is replenished by phages diffusing from other environments at the rate @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , in our subsequent numerical simulations we set @xmath48 .    the multiplicative growth ratio of the entire _",
    "lytic _ subpopulation in all environments is given by @xmath49 .",
    "where @xmath50 is the accumulated lytic subpopulation in the environment @xmath51 and @xmath52 is its growth ratio at time - step @xmath33 . as before ,",
    "it is equal to @xmath4 with probability @xmath53 and @xmath54 with probability @xmath14 . to estimate the overall growth",
    ", one needs to know the distribution of populations in all environments , which in turn is dependent on the spatiotemporal pattern of growths and collapses . assuming the same lysogenic ratio @xmath5 and lysogenic growth rate @xmath18 in all environments , the long - term logarithmic growth rate of the total phage population ( both lytic and lysogenic ) is given by the time average @xmath55 .",
    "numerical simulations allowed us to estimate the distribution of @xmath15 and to subsequently numerically solve the eq .",
    "[ eq6 ] ( see `` model and numerical simulations '' for more details ) to self - consistently determine kelly - optimal lysogenic fraction @xmath12 .",
    "3a show how thus defined @xmath12 depends on the number of environments @xmath45 and the diffusion constant @xmath47 in a model with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this figure quantifies the common - sense prediction that @xmath12 should decrease with both @xmath45 and @xmath47 .",
    "the same overall trend was previously found in a similar model @xcite for plant seed germination and dispersal . in fig .",
    "3b we show that in the model with @xmath58 and @xmath59 when the lytic growth ratio @xmath4 goes up and/or the collapse frequency @xmath14 goes down the optimal lysogeny frequency @xmath12 decreases and ultimately vanishes , indicating a transition to the purely virulent strategy .",
    "in contrast to a rather weak dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath4 predicted for a single isolated environment ( see eq . [ eq3 ] ) , our numerical results for multiple interconnected environments shown in fig .",
    "3b indicate that the fast lytic growth quantified by @xmath4 strongly favors purely virulent strategy .",
    "our simulations demonstrate the existence of a sharp boundary ( see the border between colored and black areas in both panels of fig.3 ) above which the lysogeny is no longer required and pure virulence becomes the optimal phage strategy .",
    "sustainability of different strategies of phage predation has been theoretically explored before .",
    "particular attention has been paid to the question of long - term sustainability of the pure virulent strategy @xcite . at a first glance populations of lytic phages",
    "are inherently prone to collapses .",
    "indeed , each infection leads to hundreds of new phage particles , which rapidly deplete the population of susceptible bacteria leading to the steady state with a low density of hosts prone to collapses @xcite .",
    "temperate phages , on the other hand , provide lysogens with the immunity against their own siblings and therefore are able to survive irrespective of host s density",
    ". models of interactions between temperate phages and their hosts have been considered by @xcite .",
    "stewart and levin @xcite directly compared the resilience of temperate and virulent phage populations after their hosts were exposed to changes in nutrient levels .",
    "one of the important results of that study is that for substantial variations of nutrient availability temperate phages fare better than virulent ones .",
    "we have confirmed this earlier prediction using a very different type of model that takes into account not just nutrient variability but any other type of environmental downturns . whenever temperate strategy beats virulent and dormant ones our approach allowed us to show that the optimal lysogeny frequency of a `` well - temperate '' phage resulting in the fastest population growth , has to be close to the probability for collapse of their local environments .    for pedagogical reasons , in our presentation above we assumed that the lysogenization frequency @xmath5 has to stay the same throughout the duration of good environmental conditions . in other words , we ignored phages ability to actively sense the environmental state and to use this information to dynamically adjust the lysogenization frequency .",
    "however , our estimates can be directly extended to the case where phages can distinguish between multiple types of `` good '' environments each characterized by its growth rate and its own likelihood and intensity of collapse .",
    "if these environments occur randomly and independently from each other , the overall growth can be factorized and we predict phages would adjust the lysogenization frequency in each one of these environments to be given by eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] with parameters @xmath4 , @xmath14 , and @xmath32 characteristic of this particular environment .",
    "one example of this is provided by @xmath18-phages collecting information about the nutritional state of the host and on whether it was simultaneously co - infected by other @xmath18-phages @xcite .",
    "this information is then processed by the phage to make lysis - vs - lysogeny decision that is in agreement with our predictions .",
    "that is to say , @xmath18-phage s lysogenization frequency is known to increase @xcite when they infect starved or multiple - infected hosts which both signal reduced prospects of lytic growth captured in our model by reduction in @xmath4 and/or increase in @xmath14 .",
    "optimal behavior of phages with respect to choice between virulent and temperate strategies depends on multiple extrinsic and intrinsic parameters such as phages burst size , host range , hosts availability , susceptibility , and average growth rate , the frequency and severity of environmental collapses , and finally phages ability to diffuse across multiple environments within their lifetime as an infectious particle .",
    "our key predictions are : 1 ) the temperate phage strategy dominates when environmental downturns happen frequently , are severe , or when phages live in isolated and simple environments .",
    "2 ) the virulent phage strategy gains the upper hand when the probability of downturns gets smaller , and/or collapses themselves are milder , and phages have access to multiple hosts or environments connected by diffusion ( see fig .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the empirical observation @xcite that virulent phages have systematically larger adsorption rates and shorter latency times than temperate phages .",
    "finally , our analysis suggests a simple explanation of why virulent mutants of temperate phages are not commonly found in the wild . assuming that mutants are exposed to the same environmental risks as their ancestors we can calculate the reduction in the growth rate of a virulent mutant relative to its well - tempered ancestor : @xmath60 ( see si for the exact formula and its derivation ) . this is a particular case of bergstrom and lachmann s results @xcite relating fitness differences to shannon entropy of the environment and the measure of organism s information about the environment . in our case fitness loss of the virulent mutant compared to its optimally - tempered wild type ancestor",
    "is related to the information lost when the probability of environmental collapse - @xmath14 is used as a proxy for its severity - @xmath32 .",
    "the temperate strategy is optimal when @xmath61 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] ) .",
    "hence , a virulent mutant of a temperate phage has lower fitness than its ancestor : @xmath62 .",
    "overcoming this fitness barrier by adjusting any of the other intrinsic properties of the phage such as e.g. its host range would require multiple simultaneous mutations and is , therefore , unlikely .",
    "this prediction of non - sustainability of virulent mutants of temperate phages is in agreement with the observation that protein families in known virulent phages have essentially no functional overlap with those in temperate phages @xcite .",
    "the bet - hedging approach introduced in our study focuses on random external shocks to the system at the expense of its intrinsic dynamics .",
    "thus we treat the growth rates in a given environment as fixed and completely ignore the density - dependent feedback between populations of phages and their bacterial hosts @xcite .",
    "neglecting such feedback allowed us to obtain multiple mathematical insights that would be difficult to derive otherwise .",
    "however , this simplification may influence some of our predictions , in particular for `` smart '' phages capable of using the state of its host to predict availability of hosts in near future .",
    "future work is needed to combine our bet - hedging formalism with density - dependent population dynamics .",
    "our model is updated in discrete time - steps . at each time - step the lytic subpopulation in each of the environments is either grows by a factor @xmath63 ( with probability @xmath53 ) , or collapses by a factor @xmath64 ( with probability @xmath14 ) .",
    "the lysogenic subpopulation is initially kept constant , and subsequently re - adjusted such that the selected fraction @xmath5 of the total phage population in a given environment is assigned to the lysogenic state . in case of multiple independent environments ( fig .",
    "3 ) , the diffusion operates at each times - step by redistributing the fraction @xmath47 of the total phage population equally among all environments : @xmath65 .",
    "the simulations provide us with the numerical expression for the distribution of populations @xmath66 across the environments and times .",
    "this distribution in its term determines the distribution @xmath67 of growth rates of the global phage population in all of the environments .",
    "the kelly - optimal fraction @xmath12 is then found by numerically solving the eq .",
    "[ eq6 ] for the distribution @xmath67 . after this",
    "we recalculate the distribution of @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the new value of @xmath68 .",
    "this iterative process is repeated until the relative difference of @xmath12 during subsequent iterations is less than 1% .      in the general version of the two - state environmental model",
    "the long - term logarithm growth rate is given by @xmath69 . here",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath32 are the growth rates of the lytic subpopulation under good and bad environmental conditions correspondingly , while @xmath18 is the constant growth rate of the lysogenic subpopulation . taking the derivative with respect to @xmath5 and setting it to @xmath54 results in the following equation for @xmath12 @xmath70 which can be further simplified to @xmath71 grouping all the terms with @xmath12 on one side results in the following expression for the kelly - optimal lysogenic fraction : @xmath72    [ [ kelly - optimal - ratio - for - the - multi - state - continuous - environmental - model ] ] kelly - optimal ratio for the multi - state ( continuous ) environmental model ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    here we consider a more general model in which the current growth rate @xmath15 of lytic subpopulation is not limited to just two values @xmath4 and @xmath32 but is independently drawn from an arbitrary probability distribution @xmath34 . in this case the long - term logarithmic growth rate is given by @xmath73 the kelly - optimal lysogenic ratio @xmath20 is determined by solving @xmath74 note that the second derivative of @xmath11 equal to @xmath75 is always negative .",
    "the boundary conditions are given by @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "when @xmath38 there is no growth advantage ( yet all the risks ) of going lytic and hence the optimal state for the phage population is to be 100% lysogenic : @xmath39 . on the other hand",
