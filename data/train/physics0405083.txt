    "the permanent interest in the problems of the interaction of relativistically strong electromagnetic radiation with matter finds broad applications in the development of new concepts of charged particle acceleration under space and laboratory conditions .",
    "the generation of high energy particles , both electrons and ions , when strong electromagnetic radiation interacts with a plasma , is a well known basic phenomenon .",
    "however in the limit of extremely high radiation intensity it acquires new features . under the earth conditions , an extremely strong electromagnetic wave can be practically realized only with laser beams .",
    "when a multi - petawatt laser pulse interacts with matter , conditions could be produced that were imagined to occur only in astrophysical objects .",
    "this opens the way for experimental studies of the properties of matter under these extreme conditions . with the further increase of the laser power",
    "the laser based accelerators can provide the beams of the ultrarelativistic ions , which makes feasible their applications in the high - energy physics .    direct laser acceleration of protons to relativistic energies requires intensity @xmath0 , corresponding to the dimensionless amplitude @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the electric field , wavelength , and frequency of the electromagnetic ( em ) wave , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the electron charge and mass , and @xmath7 is the proton mass . in a plasma , due to",
    "collective effects , protons can gain relativistic energies at much less intensity , about @xmath8 , as is exemplified in the theory of the strongly nonlinear hybrid electron - ion wakefield induced by a short em wave packet with the dimensionless amplitude @xmath9 greater than @xmath10 and the coulomb explosion of an overdense plasma region with the size of a few microns when a relativistically strong em wave sweeps all the electrons away @xcite .",
    "in general , the laser - driven ion acceleration arises from charge separation caused by the em wave .",
    "various regimes have been discussed in the framework of this concept : the plasma thermal expansion into vacuum @xcite ; the coulomb explosion of a strongly ionized cluster @xcite ; transverse explosion of a self - focusing channel @xcite ; ion acceleration in the strong charge separtion field caused by a quasi - static magnetic field @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the regime of the high density ultra - short _ relativistic _ ion beam generation from a thin foil by an ultra - intense em wave .",
    "we call this regime the ` laser piston ' ( lp ) .",
    "in contrast to previously discussed schemes , in this regime the ion beam generation is highly efficient and the ion energy per nucleon is proportional to the laser pulse energy .",
    "our analytical estimation conforms to the result of three - dimensional ( 3d ) particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations . in comparison with the experimental experience of present - day petawatt lasers ,",
    "the lp regime predicts yet another advantage of the exawatt lasers , in addition to possible applications depicted in @xcite .",
    "we distinguish the following two stages of the lp operation .",
    "( i ) a relativistically strong laser pulse irradiates a thin foil with thickness @xmath11 and electron density @xmath12 . the laser pulse waist is sufficiently wide , so the quasi - one - dimensional geometry is in effect .",
    "electrons are quickly accelerated up to @xmath13 by the transverse electric field , @xmath14 , of the laser pulse and they are pushed in the forward ( longitudinal ) direction by the force @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the magnetic field of the laser pulse .",
    "assume that all the electrons are displaced in the longitudinal direction , then the charge separation field , @xmath17 , between the electron and ion layers does not depend on the separation distance .",
    "in this longitudinal field the ion energy @xmath18 become relativistic in a time of the order of @xmath19 .",
    "we find that the ion layer can be accelerated up to relativistic energies during @xmath20 laser cycles under the condition @xmath21 .",
    "hence , to produce relativistic protons in one laser cycle we need an em wave with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and the pulse waist must be much greater than @xmath24 .",
    "( ii ) the accelerated foil , which consists of the electron and ion layers , can be regarded as a relativistic plasma mirror co - propagating with the laser pulse .",
    "assume that the laser pulse is perfectly reflected from this mirror . in the laboratory reference frame , before the reflection it has the energy @xmath25 , after the reflection its energy becomes much lower : @xmath26 . here",
    "the incidence laser pulse length is equal to @xmath27 , the reflected pulse length @xmath28 is longer by factor of @xmath29 , and the transverse electric field is smaller by factor @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the lorentz factor of the plasma mirror .",
    "hence the plasma mirror acquires the energy @xmath31 from the laser pulse . at this stage",
    "the plasma ( the electrons and , hence , ions ) is accelerated due to the radiation pressure .",
    "the radiation momentum is transfered to ions through the charge separation field and the ` longitudinal ' kinetic energy of ions is much greater than that of electrons .",
    "we note that the specified intensity is close to the limit where individual electrons undergo a substantial radiation friction effect @xcite .",
    "however , when the foil is accelerated up to relativistic energy , this effect becomes weaker because its strength measure , @xmath32 , is reduced by @xmath33 in the foil reference frame ( @xmath34 is the classical electron radius ) .",
    "we notice a connection of the plasma layer acceleration scheme , presented above , with a mechanism of the ion acceleration proposed by v. i. veksler @xcite , as well as with the `` snow plow '' acceleration mechanism revealed in ref .",
    "@xcite . formulated in the mid 1950 s veksler s concept of the collective acceleration of ions in an electron - ion bunch moving in a strong electromagnetic wave had a great influence both upon particle accelerator technology and plasma physics . up to now its direct realization was considered at moderate driving em radiation intensities , when transverse instabilities impede the acceleration @xcite .",
    "as we show below using 3d pic simulations , in our scheme the transverse instabilities are supressed or retarded due to the following .",
    "( i ) the plasma layers become relativistic quickly , during one or more laser wave periods , in the first stage of the acceleration . due to relativistic effects the transverse instabilities grow in the laboratory frame @xmath35 times slower than in the plasma reference frame .",
    "( ii ) the radiation pressure causes a stretching of the plasma mirror in the transverse direction , so the transverse instabilities can be retarded similarly to the slowing down of the jeans instability in the theory of the expanding early universe @xcite .",
    "in order to examine the present scheme in three - dimensional geometry , whose effects may play a crucial role in the dynamics and stability of the plasma layer under the action of a relativistically strong laser pulse , we carried out 3d pic simulations with the code remp based on the `` density decomposition '' scheme @xcite . in the simulations the laser pulse is linearly polarized along the @xmath36-axis ; it propagates along the @xmath37-axis .",
    "its dimensionless amplitude is @xmath38 corresponding to the peak intensity @xmath39 .",
    "the laser pulse is almost gaussian with fwhm size @xmath40 , it has a sharp front starting from @xmath41 , its energy is @xmath42 .",
    "the target is a @xmath43 thick plasma slab with density @xmath44 , which corresponds to the langmuir frequency @xmath45 . for @xmath46",
    "the laser pulse electric field is strong enough to strip even high - z atoms in much shorter time than the laser wave period , thus we assume that the plasma is fully ionized .",
    "the ions and electrons have the same absolute charge and their mass ratio is @xmath47 . the simulation box size is @xmath48 corresponding to the grid size @xmath49 , so the mesh size is @xmath50 .",
    "the total number of quasi - particles is @xmath51 .",
    "the boundary conditions are periodic along the @xmath52- and @xmath36-axis and absorbing along the @xmath37-axis for both the em radiation and the quasi - particles .",
    "simulation results are shown in figures [ fig-1][fig-4 ] , where the space and time units are the laser wavelength @xmath3 and period @xmath53 .",
    "( a quarter removed to reveal the interior ) and the @xmath37-component of the normalized poynting vector @xmath54 in the @xmath55-plane at @xmath56 . ]    figure [ fig-1 ] shows the ion density and @xmath37-component of the em energy flux density ( the poynting vector ) .",
    "we see that the region of the foil corresponding to the size of the laser focal spot is pushed forward .",
    "although the plasma in the foil is overcritical , it is initially _ transparent _ for the laser pulse due to the effect of relativistic transparency ( see e. g. ref .",
    "therefore a portion of the laser pulse passes through the foil .",
    "eventually it accelerates electrons and , as a result of the charge separation , a longitudinal electric field is induced .",
    "this can be interpreted as a rectification of the laser light , by the analogy with a rectifier in electrical engineering : the transverse oscillating electric field is transfromed into a longitudinal quasistatic electric field .",
    "the dimensionless amplitude of the longitudinal field is @xmath57 corresponding to @xmath58 .",
    "the typical distance of the charge separation is comparable with the initial thickness of the foil and is much less than the transverse size of the region being pushed .",
    "the ion layer is accelerated by this longitudinal field .",
    "this stage corresponds to the first step of the lp scheme .",
    "as the foil moves more and more rapidly , in its proper frame the incident wavelength increases , thus the accelerating foil becomes less transparent with time .    , green gas for lower density at @xmath59 ; the black curve shows the ion density along the laser pulse axis . ]    as seen in the cross - section of the poynting vector in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , the thickness of the red stripes , corresponding to half of the radiation wave length , increases from left to right ( along the @xmath37-axis ) .",
    "the increase is weaker at the periphery ( in the transverse direction ) ; correspondingly , we see distinctive phase curves .",
    "this ` anisotropic red shift ' results from the relativistic doppler effect when the laser pulse is reflected from the co - propagating accelerating and deforming relativistic mirror .",
    "the red shift testifies that the laser pulse is expending its energy for the acceleration of the plasma mirror , as specified above in the second stage of the lp scenario .",
    "the foil is transformed into a `` cocoon '' where the laser pulse is almost confined .",
    "the accelerated ions form a nearly flat thin _",
    "`` plate '' _ with high density , fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] .     at @xmath60 . ]",
    "figure [ fig-3 ] shows the ion maximum energy versus time and the ion phase space plot .",
    "the dependence is initially linear ; at later times it scales as @xmath61 .",
    "the ion and electron energy spectra and transverse emittances are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig-4 ] .",
    "the number of ions in the _ plate _ is @xmath62 , their energies are from @xmath63 gev to @xmath64 gev .",
    "the efficiency of the energy transformation from laser to ions in this range is 10% ; efficiency for all ions is 30% .",
    "the ion bunch density is @xmath65 @xmath66 , its duration is @xmath67 fs , its transverse emmittance is less than @xmath68 mm mrad .",
    "as the _ plate _ is quasineutral , the average longitudinal velocity of the electron bulk is about that of ions , @xmath69 , thus the average longitudinal energy of electrons is of the order of @xmath70 .",
    "correspondingly , the energy spectrum of electrons is peaked at much less energy than that of ions .     at @xmath71 .",
    "the hatched region containes @xmath72m@xmath73 particles per cross - section .",
    "values correspond to @xmath74 m . ]    according to our 2d and 3d simulations at lower intensities , corresponding to petawatt and multi - petawatt pulses , the interaction exhibits a continuous transition from regimes of refs .",
    "@xcite to the lp regime as the intesity increases .",
    "here we estimate the ion maximum energy and the acceleration efficiency in the model of the flat foil driven by the em radiation pressure , as described above in the lp scenario .",
    "in general , the radiation pressure on the foil depends on its reflectance @xcite .",
    "assume that in the instantaneous reference frame , where the foil is at rest , the relative amplitudes of reflected and transmitted waves are @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively . here @xmath77 because of energy conservation .",
    "the radiation pressure is the sum of the incident , reflected and transmitted em wave momentum fluxes , @xmath78 . here",
    "the primed values correspond to the moving reference frame , variables without a prime are taken in the laboratory frame . in a quasi - one - dimensional geometry , at the foil location",
    "@xmath79 the laser electric field is @xmath80 . if the foil is accelerated as a single whole , in its reference frame the incident radiation frequency becomes smaller and smaller with time , thus the reflection becomes more and more efficient and @xmath81 becomes closer to unity .",
    "in fact , the foil reference frame is not inertial since the foil is accelerated .",
    "hence , the em wave frequency @xmath82 decreases with time in this frame as described in ref .",
    "nevertheless we can assume that the acceleration is relatively small and thus @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the foil instantaneous velocity .",
    "as is well known , the em radiation pressure is a relativistic invariant @xcite , therefore we can write the foil motion equation as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the momentum of ions representing the foil . in the simplest case ,",
    "when @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the solution @xmath89 is an algebraic function of @xmath90 . for the initial condition @xmath91 at @xmath92 it can be written in a compact form as @xmath93 , where @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    "the ion kinetic energy is @xmath98 . as @xmath99 it asymptotically tends to @xmath100 .",
    "this motion is analogous to that of a charged particle driven by a radiation pressure @xcite , but in our case the role of the thomson cross - section is played by the quantity @xmath101 .    to find an upper limit of the ion energy acquired due to the interaction with a laser pulse of finite duration",
    ", we must include the dependence of the laser em field on space and time .",
    "because of the foil motion , the interaction time can be much longer than the laser pulse duration @xmath102 . therefore it is convenient to consider the dynamics in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath103 which can be interpreted as the normalized energy of the laser pulse portion that has been interacting with the moving foil by time @xmath90 .",
    "its maximum value is @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the laser pulse energy , @xmath106 is the number of ions in the foil . the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq - p ] ) , rewritten in terms of @xmath107 , gives the ion kinetic energy @xmath108 for the initial condition @xmath109 .",
    "the upper limit of the ion kinetic energy and , correspondingly , the laser to ion energy transformation efficiency can be found from eq .",
    "( [ eq - e - kin ] ) substituting @xmath110 : @xmath111 where we set @xmath112 for simplicity .",
    "here @xmath113 is the reflection coefficient , taken in the co - moving reference frame , averaged over the foil motion path ; @xmath114 .",
    "we see that if @xmath115 , in this model almost all the energy of the laser pulse is transformed into ion kinetic energy . using eq .",
    "( [ eq - e - limit ] ) and the @xmath61 asymptotic dependence of the ion energy on time , for given simulation parameters we estimate the acceleration time and length as @xmath116 ps and @xmath117 mm , respectively . in the presented simulations the acceleration time is limited by computer resources .",
    "however , the analytical estimation eq .",
    "( [ eq - e - limit ] ) allows us to conlude that at given simulation parameters the limiting ion kinetic energy is 30 gev .",
    "since the ion bunch is relativistic , another ultra - intense laser pulse , sent with proper delay , can accelerate the bunch further .",
    "in conclusion , the lp regime of ultra - intense laser - plasma interaction can be employed in a laser - driven heavy ion collider . in the collision of two",
    "ion bunches the number of reactions with cross - section @xmath118 is @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the bunch sectional area . adopting the presented simulation parameters , we obtain @xmath121 .",
    "provided that the energy is high enough so that @xmath122 @xmath123 , we can get about a million events in a few femtosecond shot . as suggested by two of co - authors ( t. t. and g. m. ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can get a short multi - exawatt laser pulse with sufficient contrast ratio ( @xmath124 ) using the megajoule nif facility and present - day technology",
    ". then the resulting ion bunch energy can be over @xmath125 gev per nucleon , which is suitable for the quark - gluon plasma studies @xcite .",
