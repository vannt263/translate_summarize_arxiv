    "quantum interference of electrons is fundamentally important for electron transport in disordered conductors @xcite .",
    "quantum coherent effects are mostly pronounced at low temperatures in which case certain interaction mechanisms are effectively `` frozen out '' and , hence , can not anymore restrict the ability of electrons to interfere . at the same time",
    ", there exists at least one mechanism , electron - electron interactions , which remains important down to lowest temperatures and may destroy quantum interference of electrons down to @xmath2 .",
    "it is , therefore , highly desirable to formulate a general theoretical formalism which would allow to describe electron interference effects in the presence of disorder and electron - electron interactions at any temperature , including the limit @xmath3 .    in a series of papers",
    "@xcite we offered such an approach which extends chakravarty - schmid description @xcite of weak localization ( wl ) and generalizes feynman - vernon path integral influence functional technique to fermionic systems with disorder and interactions . with the aid of this technique it turned out to be possible to quantitatively explain low temperature saturation of wl correction to conductance @xmath4 commonly observed in diffusive metallic wires @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that this saturation effect is caused by electron - electron interactions .",
    "it is worth pointing out that low temperature saturation of wl correction and of the electron decoherence time @xmath5 ( extracted from @xmath4 or by other means ) has been repeatedly observed not only in metallic wires but also in virtually any type of disordered conductors ranging from individual quantum dots @xcite to very strongly disordered 3d structures and granular metals @xcite .",
    "it is quite likely that in all these systems we are dealing with _ the same _ fundamental effect of electron - electron interactions . in order to support ( or discard ) this conjecture",
    "it is necessary to develop a unified theoretical description which would cover essentially all types of disordered conductors .",
    "although the approach @xcite is formally an exact procedure treating electron dynamics in the presence of disorder and interactions , in some cases , e.g. , for quantum dots and granular metals , it can be rather difficult to directly evaluate @xmath4 within this technique .",
    "one of the problems in those cases is that the description in terms of quasiclassical electron trajectories may become insufficient , and electron scattering on disorder should be treated on more general footing .",
    "another ( though purely technical ) point is averaging over disorder . in our approach @xcite disorder averaging is ( can be ) postponed until the last stage of the calculation which is convenient in certain physical situations . in other cases  like ones studied below ",
    "it might be , in contrast , more appropriate to perform disorder averaging already in the beginning of the whole analysis .",
    "in addition , it is desirable to deal with the model which would embrace various types of conductors with well defined properties both in the long and short wavelength limits .    in this paper",
    "we make a first step towards this unified theory .",
    "namely , we will describe a disordered conductor by means of an array of ( metallic ) quantum dots connected via junctions ( scatterers ) with an arbitrary distribution of transmissions of their conducting channels .",
    "this model will allow to easily crossover between the limits of granular metals and those with point - like impurities and to treat spatially restricted and spatially extended conductors within the same theoretical framework .",
    "electron scattering on each such scatterer will be treated within the most general scattering matrix formalism @xcite adopted to include electron - electron interaction effects @xcite . averaging over disorder will be performed within the non - linear @xmath6model technique in keldysh formulation as first proposed by horbach and schn @xcite for non - interacting electrons .",
    "this method has certain advantages over the imaginary time approach @xcite since it allows to treat both equilibrium and non - equilibrium problems and also enables one to include coulomb interaction between electrons in a straightforward manner @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will analyze wl corrections to conductance merely for non - interacting electrons and will include interaction effects only phenomenologically by introducing an effective electron dephasing time @xmath7 as a parameter of our theory .",
    "systematic analysis of the effect of electron - electron interactions on weak localization within this formalism will be developed elsewhere .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we define the basic model of a 1d array of quantum dots and outline the key features of our formalism . in sec .",
