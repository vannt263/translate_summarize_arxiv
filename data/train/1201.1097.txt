    "this disappearance of traditional magic numbers was ascribed to so far unexplored nuclear forces which act to reduce the size of the spherical shell gaps  @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , recent values of atomic masses measured with high precision using penning trap mass spectrometers  @xcite were interpreted in favor of a reinforced rigidity of the @xmath0 gap towards @xmath6ni .",
