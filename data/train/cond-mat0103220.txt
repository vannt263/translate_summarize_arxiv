    "we investigate the general random walk @xmath3 obeying the equation of motion @xmath4 where @xmath5 is white noise with zero mean and unit variance and @xmath6 .",
    "let us begin with @xmath7 .",
    "the _ first passage time _ is the time it takes for the walk to reach zero .",
    "when the walk has no bias , as above , there is no definite time to expect such an event and the distribution is a power law . to find the first passage time distribution @xmath8 , start an ensemble of random walkers at @xmath9 and at time @xmath10",
    "whenever a random walk reaches zero , it is removed from the ensemble .",
    "let @xmath11 be the number density of walks at time @xmath12 and positive @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath11 is a solution of the diffusion equation with absorbing boundary condition , @xmath14 . more precisely , @xmath15 at long times .",
    "let @xmath16 be the integral of this probability distribution over positive values of @xmath13 .",
    "this is the probability that a random walk at time @xmath12 has not crossed zero .",
    "the first passage time distribution is then given by @xmath17 although we will not show it , this result is universal for all symmetric walks .",
    "any random walk which is equally likely to move forward as backward by a given amount has a first passage time distribution with the same asymptotic form .",
    "this is the sparre - anderson theorem [ 1 ] .",
    "note that @xmath18 sets the time scale .",
    "the previous discussion is one of the few first passage time problems where an exact solution may be easily found by solving a fokker - planck equation with absorbing boundaries .",
    "extensions of this method to more complicated random walks , such as the second - order random walk described by @xmath19 exist [ 2 ] .",
    "however , we investigate the first passage time distribution for this walk , and for any @xmath20 , in a different way .    at long times ,",
    "the first passage time distribution for these processes is a power law , @xmath21 as computed above , @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is known to be @xmath24 [ 3 ] .",
    "the others are most likely not exact fractions and are nontrivial critical exponents of certain statistical models .",
    "we first present numerical results for @xmath25 .",
    "then , after presenting a heuristic derivation of @xmath26 , we make a quantitative estimate for the shift in first passage exponent for @xmath27 .",
    "our analytical results will draw heavily from the theory of levy flights [ 4 ] .",
    "we also address separately the @xmath2 limit [ 5 ] .    finally , within zero temperature",
    "mean field theory , we demonstrate that the first passage time exponent in the @xmath28 case is the avalanche size exponent for a dynamically elastic extended object , like a crack front or interface , being pulled through a random medium by a uniform applied force at a special point in the parameter space [ 6 ] . generically , for these nonequilibrium systems there is a transition from an overall stationary phase to an overall moving phase as the applied force is increased toward a critical value . increasing the applied force from the static side triggers _ local _ motion of the interface for some finite amount of time as long as the applied force is held fixed from the time the toppling starts until the time the toppling stops .",
    "the distribution of amount the interface has moved during an `` avalanche '' event , i.e. the avalanche size , gives us information about the continuity ( or discontinuity ) of the depinning transition and , therefore , has been a focus of study over the years [ 7 ] .",
    "a _ levy variable _ @xmath29 is a random variable with a power law distribution for large @xmath30 , @xmath31 with @xmath32 . the variance @xmath33 is infinite for these distributions and @xmath34 is called the _ levy exponent _ of @xmath30 .",
    "a _ levy flight _ is a random walk with each step a levy variable .",
    "it is the sum of many independently drawn levy variables . because of the infinite variance",
    ", a levy flight is an irregular walk dominated by the few largest jumps [ 4 ] .",
    "let @xmath35 be the distribution of @xmath36 .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath37 is the @xmath38th power of the fourier transform of @xmath39 . if @xmath40 were twice differentiable at zero , then @xmath41 for @xmath42 real and positive .",

    "the second moment of the distribution is infinite , and @xmath40 has a cusp at zero for @xmath32 . the form of the cusp may be determined as follows : for small @xmath43 , the fourier transform is approximately the integral of the distribution over the first wavelength @xmath44 , or @xmath45 when there is a cusp , the limiting distribution is not a gaussian , but has the following form [ 4 ] @xmath46 @xmath47 by rescaling @xmath43 , @xmath42 can be made into a pure phase . for the case where @xmath39 is symmetric about zero , the fourier transform is real and @xmath48 .",
    "it is clear that this distribution has the correct form near @xmath49 , and increasing @xmath38 is equivalent to a rescaling of @xmath43 . the limiting distribution gets wider without changing shape  so it is a fixed point of convolution .",
    "we will need one special nonsymmetric distribution , the distribution of a flight composed of only positive steps . in this case",
    ", @xmath50 is zero for @xmath51 negative , therefore @xmath37 must be analytic in the lower half - plane .",
    "in other words , @xmath52 for @xmath53 is the analytic continuation of @xmath52 for @xmath54 .",
    "as @xmath43 is rotated to @xmath55 through negative imaginary values , @xmath56 acquires a phase @xmath57 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath58 @xmath59 for the special case @xmath60 , @xmath61 .    and finally ,",
    "if we were to compute the first passage time distribution for the process , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is levy noise ( a levy variable symmetrically distributed about zero ) , then we would find a first passage time exponent of @xmath64 .",
    "even though the levy flight is irregular , the position does not cross zero any faster than it does in the nearest - neighbor random walk .",
    "this is the sparre - anderson theorem once more , which we refer the reader to ref .",
    "[ 1 ] for the details .",
    "to obtain the first passage time exponent @xmath65 numerically is not as easy as it might appear .",
    "direct numerical integration of the equation of motion becomes more cumbersome with increasing @xmath20 . to efficiently simulate the equation ,",
    "we have calculated the free - space propagation kernels for @xmath25 ( appendix a ) . in this context , the propagation kernel is the probability distribution of @xmath66 , given initial values @xmath67 , @xmath68 , ... , @xmath69 and final values @xmath70 , ... @xmath71 .",
    "we first generate the highest - order time derivative , @xmath71 , and then new values for each lower - order time derivative until @xmath72 is updated .",
    "the next time step @xmath73 is chosen so that the variance for the next value of @xmath13 will be smaller .",
    "the ratio of the new variance to the old is @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath74 should be small so that the walk does not become negative then positive within one time step .",
    "the probability of this occurring is exponentially small in the inverse of @xmath74 . with this algorithm ,",
    "if @xmath67 is large , the time steps are large as well .",
    "the number of time steps required for the simulation only grows logarithmically as a function of the first passage time . near the end of the simulation ,",
    "when @xmath13 is small , the time steps become small as well , and accuracy is not sacrificed .    the first passage time distributions for @xmath25",
    "are shown in fig . 1 on a log - log scale",
    ". each plot contains approximately @xmath75 samples in bins of doubling size .",
    "table i contains the linear regression values of the exponents .",
    "the results are independent of @xmath74 over the range @xmath76 $ ] , indicating that @xmath74 is small enough .",
    "for the @xmath28 case , @xmath3 is the integral of a random walk . in other words , the variable that executes the random walk is @xmath78 , the velocity . to exploit this fact",
    ", we introduce a new time counter @xmath79 and divide the time axis into intervals @xmath80 between the points where the velocity crosses zero",
    ". then the interval sizes @xmath80 are first passage times for an ordinary random walk .",
    "there is one complication . referring back to eq .",
    "( 3 ) , the time scale until a zero - crossing is the initial value squared .",
    "so right after a zero - crossing , the initial value is zero .",
    "since the probability distribution is singular at zero , the random walk reaches zero again instantly , and then again , infinitely many times .",
    "this is a well known property of random walks  they jiggle about every value before moving on . since this affects only the distribution of the smallest times , we cut off the distribution of times near zero by imagining the system on a lattice .",
    "now we have a finite and discrete set of time intervals @xmath80 with each interval distributed with the levy exponent @xmath81 .",
    "these time intervals are independently distributed because the velocity undergoes a simple random walk .    to compute the first passage time for the position",
    ", we must compute the total time @xmath82 until the position becomes negative .",
    "@xmath38 is the first zero - crossing of the velocity which happens at a negative value of the position so we are actually slightly overestimating @xmath12 by summing @xmath38 intervals .",
    "we can control for this by summing @xmath83 intervals instead , which would be a slight underestimate .",
    "this estimate of @xmath12 , be it over or under , should not affect the first passage time exponent since we do not expect the last position step ( corresponding to the partial time step ) to be arbitrarily large .    to continue we need to know two things  1 ) the distribution of @xmath38 , @xmath84 , and 2 ) given @xmath38 , the probability distribution of @xmath12 .",
    "the first problem is actually no problem at all .",
    "since the velocity is just as likely to go up at the start of a time interval as it is to go down , the position is as likely to be positive as negative .",
    "therefore , the position is a symmetric walk on the zero - crossings ( actually , a symmetric levy flight with independent steps distributed with levy exponent 1/3 using scaling arguments ) . by the sparre - anderson theorem",
    "[ 1 ] , the distribution of the first - passage-@xmath38 is asymptotically the same as for an unbiased , simple random walk , and @xmath85 for large @xmath38 .    and now for the second problem .",
    "the distribution of the sum of @xmath38 _ independent _ @xmath86 s , @xmath87 , is a levy distribution .",
    "the fact that the steps are distributed with levy exponent @xmath81 and that all of the @xmath86 s are positive fixes the fourier transform of the levy distribution .",
    "the inverse fourier transform can be computed exactly in this case . for large t ,",
    "@xmath88 this distribution is small for @xmath89 , and it may be approximated by @xmath90 for @xmath91 . using scaling ,",
    "analogous results may be derived for @xmath92 , where a closed form does not exist .",
    "now , the time intervals we are adding are not really independent .",
    "this is because we are restricting attention to levy flights that end on the @xmath38th step and this an atypical sample of all levy flights with @xmath38 steps .",
    "however , the properties we actually use from the previous distribution  namely that it is small for @xmath89 and the appropriate power law for large @xmath12  are the scaling laws for the sum of almost any collection of @xmath38 levy variables , where @xmath38 is large .",
    "so , although we do not prove it , we assume that these properties hold for the correct @xmath87 , or the distribution of the time elapsed for those levy flights that end on the @xmath38th step .",
    "this is why we refer to our derivation as heuristic .",
    "all the ingredients are now in place for computing @xmath26 .",
    "there is a probability @xmath84 for any value of @xmath38 , and given @xmath38 , we know the probability distribution of @xmath12 .",
    "so to find the total distribution of @xmath12 , we sum up the conditional distributions @xmath93 weighted by the probability of @xmath38 , or @xmath94 approximating the sum with an integral and using the approximate scaling form for @xmath93 , @xmath95 we obtain the following asymptotic form , @xmath96 so that @xmath97 .",
    "this result is unchanged when @xmath38 is shifted by one unit , so that the last step is of no consequence for the exponent as there are typically many zero - crossings , making our derivation self - consistent .",
    "y. g. sinai has rigorously computed @xmath26 [ 3 ] ; we have used some similar methods .",
    "the next random walk we consider is the random surge process , governed by @xmath99 the acceleration is now an ordinary random walk . after a time t , the acceleration , velocity and position scale as @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "we proceed as we did for the @xmath28 case .",
    "once again , we divide the time axis by the zero - crossings of the velocity .",
    "the time intervals @xmath80 are now distributed with the levy exponent @xmath97 .",
    "the sum of @xmath38 independent @xmath86 s is approximately zero for @xmath103 , and for larger @xmath12 , is approximated by @xmath104    proceeding casually , we may think that , as before , the distribution @xmath84 has levy exponent of @xmath105 since that result is universal for all symmetric walks .",
    "we perform an integral analogous to eq .",
    "( 14 ) and obtain a first passage time levy exponent @xmath106 . however , our numerical simulations yield a levy exponent of @xmath0 . the exponent is closer to @xmath24 than @xmath107 . clearly , there is something wrong .",
    "the method fails because there are now _ correlations _ between the @xmath108 steps , where @xmath108 is the change in @xmath13 during a @xmath80 step . in the previous @xmath28 case ,",
    "the velocity undergoes a simple random walk and so its sign is random after a zero - crossing . in this @xmath109 case ,",
    "the velocity is the integral of a random walk .",
    "it is a differentiable function and so almost certainly changes sign when it hits zero .",
    "consequently , the @xmath108 steps alternate in sign . in addition , as the acceleration drifts about , the @xmath108 steps increase in size .",
    "the acceleration at the beginning of each next time interval is larger on average than the previous one , making the next @xmath80 and , therefore , the next @xmath108 larger than the last .    a large number of alternating",
    ", increasing steps will reach zero quickly . from the numerical simulation , with each oscillation there is a definite probability of reaching zero which is almost constant . in other words ,",
    "the distribution @xmath84 is not a power law as in the @xmath28 case , but an exponential , @xmath110 see table ii and the corresponding fig .",
    "2 . the number of velocity zero - crossings must be odd because the position can become negative only after the velocity has become negative . with this exponential distribution",
    ", the number of time intervals one must add up is actually quite small .",
    "however , adding a finite number of independently drawn levy variables distributed with levy exponent @xmath24 produces a flight with levy exponent @xmath24 , so it is quite surprising that adding @xmath38 of them together , where @xmath38 has a finite mean , leads to anything other than an exponent of @xmath24 .    and yet , adding a small number of _ correlated _ levy variables does shift the exponent . to quantitatively describe the correlation in magnitude , we need to determine how the initial acceleration sets the time scale for each @xmath80 interval .",
    "we saw from eq .",
    "( 3 ) for the @xmath7 random walk that the time scale is the initial value squared . therefore",
    ", the time scale between two acceleration zero - crossings is the initial acceleration squared .",
    "because the time between velocity zero - crossings is comprised of many acceleration zero - crossings , the time scale between velocity zero - crossings is fixed in the same way .",
    "this argument is somewhat general , so it is nice to verify that it is correct . the coefficient in the formula for the first passage time distribution was computed in ref . [ 2 ] for the case of the @xmath28 random walk by solving the fokker - planck equation with the appropriate boundary conditions . @xmath111 for large t. note that @xmath112 .",
    "since the acceleration in the @xmath109 case is exactly the same as the velocity in the @xmath28 case , we can translate this result into @xmath109 language by replacing @xmath113 with @xmath114 .",
    "therefore in the @xmath109 case , the square of the initial acceleration determines the time scale until the next zero - crossing .",
    "so the square of the initial acceleration at each time step determines the scale of the next time step . since the acceleration is an ordinary random walk ,",
    "its square has a size proportional to the total elapsed time .",
    "therefore , @xmath115 where @xmath30 is a unit levy variable and @xmath116 is the total elapsed time . to describe this correlated process",
    ", we set the units of time so that @xmath117 is a unit size levy variable @xmath118 .",
    "the next time step , @xmath119 , is no longer unit sized , but has a magnitude determined by the square of the acceleration , or , equivalently , the total elapsed time .",
    "so to find @xmath119 we take @xmath117 and multiply it by separate , independent , unit levy variable @xmath120 . to find @xmath121 ,",
    "we take the total elapsed time , @xmath122 , which is the expected square acceleration , and multiply by @xmath123 . in equations , @xmath124 @xmath125@xmath126@xmath127 the total time @xmath12 that has elapsed after @xmath38 steps is then @xmath128    the asymptotic distribution is extracted when @xmath129 .",
    "this means we need to determine the distribution of products of levy variables . taking the natural logarithm",
    ", the product becomes a sum .",
    "define @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",
    "we use the following approximate distribution for both levy variables , @xmath133@xmath134 with @xmath135 . keep in mind , in order to compute @xmath136 , the levy exponent @xmath137 of the @xmath29 variables equals @xmath24 . in terms of the transformed variables , the distribution of @xmath138 and @xmath139",
    "is given by @xmath140 if @xmath118 and @xmath120 had _ different _ levy exponents , @xmath141 , the distribution of the sum would be @xmath142 for large @xmath143 , @xmath144 , i.e. the smaller exponent dominates the tail .",
    "however , when @xmath145 , we have @xmath146 in terms of @xmath118 and @xmath120 , the probability distribution of @xmath147 is [ 8 ] @xmath148 in general , the probability distribution for @xmath79 independent levy variables multiplied together is @xmath149 the @xmath150 is required for normalization .",
    "transforming back to the original @xmath80 variables , @xmath151 we substitute @xmath152 and @xmath153 and this distribution becomes @xmath93 the probability distribution of the @xmath38th passage time of the velocity . unlike the @xmath38th passage time of the acceleration",
    ", @xmath93 is not a levy stable distribution because of the correlations .",
    "more specifically , @xmath93 is the distribution of a product of @xmath38 levy variables @xmath154 .",
    "the expression for the @xmath38th passage time we derived earlier is @xmath155 , which differs in subleading terms from the previous expression .",
    "note that @xmath93 coincides with the @xmath38th passage time distribution for the position in the @xmath28 case .",
    "both the velocity for @xmath109 and the position for @xmath28 are integrals of an @xmath7 random walk .",
    "observe that the distribution @xmath156 is _ not _ the same as the distribution of the sum of two variables distributed as @xmath157 there is an additional logarithm .",
    "we determined @xmath156 numerically and it agrees with this form ( fig .",
    "3 ) . for higher",
    "@xmath38 , there are @xmath83 factors of @xmath158 .    before estimating @xmath136 , we must make one last argument in the form of an approximation .",
    "up until this point , @xmath87 assumes that each step is free to be larger than the previous one .",
    "this is because we have not yet taken into account the conditional dependence of the correlation on the position being positive for the walk to persist .",
    "in fact , the generic situation when the steps are ever - increasing and alternating in sign is for there to be only one step .",
    "this means that walks that survive more than one step are special . for these walks ,",
    "the second step is an exceptional pick from the distribution .",
    "the _ easiest _",
    "way for the walk to survive is for the second step to be approximately the same size as the first step . in other words , the size of the first step cuts off the distribution of the second step .",
    "the result is that the second step shares the distribution of the first . for the third step , the position is positive , and now its time interval is distributed the same as the second step would have been . generalizing our argument ,",
    "any two _ complete _ time intervals can simply be lumped together as one and we conclude that the distribution of the total after @xmath38 steps is the same as the distribution of the step sizes after @xmath159 steps . in other words",
    ", @xmath87 is not the correct distribution for @xmath38 steps , but @xmath160 is .",
    "we present evidence for the even - numbered complete steps being typically small in fig .",
    "4 . for @xmath109 ,",
    "the second step is , on average , about five times smaller than the first time interval . for @xmath161 ,",
    "the second time interval is typically twice as small as the first .",
    "so we now have all the ingredients to estimate the levy exponent @xmath136 .",
    "we arrive at @xmath162 @xmath163 which gives @xmath164 . substituting the numerical value @xmath165",
    ", we find the levy index @xmath166 .",
    "this result is a shift in the right direction from our original estimate , but it is still too large .",
    "figure 4 suggests that our estimation scheme may work better for @xmath167 and so we extend the method to @xmath168 .",
    "as before , we define the two levy flights of the time and position intervals between velocity zero - crossings . for @xmath167 , the size correlation factor for the time interval levy flight turns out to be the same factor of the elapsed time as in the @xmath109 case with each step retaining only the memory of the highest - order derivative . to be more precise ,",
    "the initial acceleration at the start of each time interval for the @xmath109 case is replaced with the highest - order random variable .",
    "we ignore any other memory effects .",
    "then , for the @xmath20th - order process , the step - size distribution for the @xmath80 intervals are governed by the passage time exponent for the @xmath169th - order process .",
    "referring back to eq .",
    "( 28 ) , @xmath152 and @xmath170 .",
    "in addition , the correlation in the sign of the @xmath108 still persists for the @xmath20th - order random walk so the distribution @xmath84 remains exponential with a decay constant that we determine numerically .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1 levy exponent will be a small perturbation about the @xmath169th first passage time exponent with a shift of @xmath171 .",
    "for @xmath161 and @xmath172 , we observe that our estimation scheme yields more accurate results .",
    "see table ii .    as in the @xmath28 case ,",
    "for @xmath173 we consider the last partial time step to be a full one .",
    "given that @xmath160 is the more appropriate distribution , the bulk of the first passage time for a given @xmath38 is taken up during the last two steps ( up to subleading corrections ) .",
    "so the these last partial time steps should be distributed just as the first passage time .",
    "we have numerically verified this to be the case .",
    "majumdar _ et .",
    "al_. [ 5 ] have constructed a completely different approximation scheme to compute the first passage time exponent for these higher - order random walks . while we refer the reader to ref . [ 5 ] for the details , their scheme is rather accurate for @xmath26 and @xmath136 .",
    "as @xmath20 increases , we also expect the decay constant @xmath175 to grow .",
    "in fact , in the limit that @xmath20 becomes large , the first passage time exponent reaches a limiting value .",
    "we consider the solution to eq .",
    "( 1 ) with initial conditions @xmath176 .",
    "it is @xmath177 which is a linear function of @xmath5 and therefore is the inner product of @xmath5 with a kernel . in this case , @xmath178 it is easy to see that this expression satisfies eq .",
    "( 1 ) .    when solving for the time when @xmath3 first becomes zero , it is permitted to rescale @xmath3 by any finite number , even if that number is a function of time .",
    "this does not change the set of points where @xmath3 is zero .",
    "rescaling by @xmath179 so that @xmath180 and dropping constant factors , @xmath181    in the large @xmath20 limit , @xmath182 is indistinguishable from an exponential in the region where it has the most weight ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "the result is that @xmath184    majumdar it et al . [",
    "5 ] have noted that the @xmath2 random walk has the same first passage time exponent as a very different system  the solution of the two - dimensional diffusion equation with a random initial condition , @xmath185 @xmath186 in polar coordinates , the value of @xmath187 is given by @xmath188 where we have used @xmath189 .",
    "the angular integration leaves the integral in terms of a new random variable , @xmath190 .",
    "we now have @xmath191 transforming variables to @xmath192 , we arrive at @xmath193 where we used the fact that @xmath194 so that @xmath195 .    comparing this kernel with the kernel for the @xmath2 random walk , we see that they are indeed the same . as a result , the distribution of times for the diffusive field to change sign at one point is the same as the distribution of the first passage time for the @xmath2 random walk for long times , where the initial conditions are irrelevant .",
    "consider a planar crack front moving through rough , brittle material . in the quasistatic regime ,",
    "the planar crack front is a line with long - range static elasticity .",
    "there is a uniform stress applied to the material , which drives the crack front forward .",
    "but there are also local , random variations in the fracture toughness which the crack front needs to overcome to move forward .",
    "these randomly varying forces are pinning forces .",
    "the competition between the global pulling and local pinning forces as mediated by the elasticity of the crack front determines its dynamics . for small values of the applied force ,",
    "the pinning forces eventually dominate and the crack front remains stuck .",
    "for some finite value of the applied force , the pinning forces are not strong enough to keep the crack front in place and it moves forward .",
    "the boundary between these two phases is the depinning transition .",
    "approaching the depinning transition from the static side , a small increase in the applied force causes a tiny portion of the crack front to move forward .",
    "this portion causes a few more regions to move forward as well , only to be eventually stopped by more strongly pinned regions .",
    "the only role of the applied force here is to induce the initial motion of the tiny portion .",
    "it remains fixed until the local motion of the crack front stops . near the depinning transition",
    ", there exists a sequence of these discrete , localized _ avalanche events _ with distribution of sizes @xmath196 .",
    "the avalanche size is defined as the total amount of the crack front that has moved forward during these events .",
    "a power law distribution of avalanche sizes as the force approaches the critical force indicates a continuous , second - order - like depinning transition .    near the depinning transition , the motion of the crack front is jerky .",
    "we therefore model its dynamics in terms of discrete space and time . within an infinite - range model , where each crack front segment is coupled equally to every other ,",
    "the spatial degrees of freedom along the crack front are averaged out .",
    "we define @xmath197 to be the total number of segments of the crack front that hop forward at discrete time @xmath12 . given that we are only concerned with the few segments that are on the verge of hopping forward ,",
    "@xmath197 is poissonian distributed . in this infinite - range limit , and in the dissipative regime , the mean of @xmath197 is determined by the number of segments that have hopped at the previous time step only .",
    "in addition , the mean of @xmath197 fluctuates statistically until it reaches zero , whereupon the motion stops . in the limit of large avalanches where things are changing slowly with time",
    ", the equation of motion for the avalanches at the depinning transition is @xmath198 in the ito representation ( the time derivatives are forward differences ) .",
    "when @xmath199 reaches zero , the avalanche is over .",
    "we refer the reader to ref . [ 6 ] for a more detailed derivation .",
    "so far , we have neglected any effects like elastic waves that are indeed present along the crack front . if a piece of the crack front moves forward , that motion creates an extra transient force on its neighbors as the elastic wave propagates along the crack front .",
    "the extra transient stress is called a stress overshoot .",
    "this effect is different than pure inertia , which would be an extra transient stress on the segment itself after it jumps .",
    "however , we demonstrate that the two effects are similar in this infinite - range model for a particular value of the stress overshoot [ 6 ] .",
    "if we were to take into account elastic waves along the crack front , the mean of @xmath197 depends on several previous time steps . in other words",
    ", there are higher - order corrections to eq .",
    "( 39 ) that are usually irrelevant in the long time limit .",
    "the most significant terms are the first and second time derivatives , and the first time derivative is the only relevant term .",
    "if we fine - tune the coefficient of @xmath200 to zero , we arrive at a tricritical point . here , the second - order derivative is the most relevant term and we obtain the equation of motion @xmath201 the variable we are interested in is @xmath202 the avalanche size .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath203 is determined by the boundary condition @xmath204 .    in order to find the distribution of @xmath196 ,",
    "we use the size of the avalanche as a new path - dependent time coordinate .",
    "we transform time on each particular path in the path - integral differently , in a way that depends on the history of @xmath199 .",
    "this transformation alters the density of @xmath199 s at any given time , mixing together @xmath199 s from different times so that they appear simultaneous . because of this property , it is difficult to perform the transformation in the fokker - planck equation ; but the transformation is easy in the path integral",
    ".    a reparameterization of time , even a path dependent one , does not affect the answers to questions that do not involve the time explicitly .",
    "the probability for a stochastic walker to arrive at point b from point a is independent of the global time , but the probability for a stochastic walker to be at point b at time @xmath12 is not .",
    "similarly , the avalanche size of a given walk does not involve the time lapse of the walk as the upper cutoff of the integral is determined by the boundary condition on @xmath199 and not the time explicitly .",
    "choosing the new time coordinate @xmath196 to tick at the new rate , @xmath205 and using the property of gaussian noise , @xmath206 , the ( ito ) equation pair @xmath207 @xmath208 become @xmath209 @xmath210 replacing @xmath211 with @xmath212 completes the transformation .",
    "the zeros of @xmath211 are also the zeros of @xmath13 so the value of @xmath196 when @xmath13 is zero is then the avalanche size .",
    "we therefore find the distribution of avalanche sizes to be the distribution of first passage times @xmath196 for the @xmath28 random walk .",
    "it has a levy exponent @xmath24 .",
    "we may perform the same transformation on the fokker - planck equation directly , although the motivation then becomes obscure .",
    "consider the following probability - conserving equation , @xmath213 for a new quantity @xmath214 .",
    "if we integrate @xmath214 over all @xmath196 , we recover the original fokker - planck equation . on the other hand ,",
    "if integrate @xmath214 with respect to @xmath12 from zero to infinity , we obtain @xmath215 where @xmath216 . defining @xmath212 , as before , gives @xmath217 which is the fokker - planck equation for the @xmath28 random walk .",
    "this demonstrates the equivalence of the two problems",
    ".    it should now be clear that the avalanche size exponent for eq .",
    "( 39 ) is @xmath64 since the same time reparameterization may be performed in that case also .",
    "this relates the avalanche size exponent to the first passage time of the @xmath7 random walk .",
    "we have presented a relation between the shift in the first passage time exponent and the decay rate of the probability of @xmath38 velocity zero - crossings for the @xmath20th random walk .",
    "the method can be exact for @xmath28 , but not for @xmath218 because of correlations .",
    "more work is needed to estimate the decay constant of @xmath84 since this would determine the convergence rate of the exponents to the @xmath2 value .",
    "in addition , we do not have any bounds on the error of the first passage time exponent as the approximation is uncontrolled .",
    "we also do not know which types of correlations for levy flights lead to shifts in exponents and which do not",
    ". a classification of correlations in terms of these two categories might be useful .",
    "we have opted to slice up time in terms of velocity zero - crossings , instead of using the global time in the fokker - planck equation .",
    "this approach allows us to analyze the higher - order random walks in terms of a one - dimensional levy process since the phase variables are the position and the time only .",
    "the remaining variables are subsumed in the @xmath169th - order random walk that the velocity undergoes between the zero - crossings .    with eq .",
    "( 42 ) we have also reparameterized the global time , but in a different way .",
    "we use a path - dependent time transformation to analyze the avalanche statistics of a nonlinear second - order random walk in terms of the first passage time exponent of the linear second - order random walk .",
    "this allows us to give a novel physical interpretation of the first passage time exponent for the @xmath28 case .",
    "since the avalanche size does not depend on the global time , it has been known to us that one can find the stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation corresponding to the nonlinear random walk in eq .",
    "( 40 ) and then arrive at the avalanche size exponent after invoking a simple scaling argument [ 9 ] . since this method gives a new derivation of the avalanche size exponent , it indirectly gives a new derivation of the first passage time exponent for the @xmath28 case .",
    "this insight may be useful to construct a derivation of @xmath65 for @xmath173 .",
    "finally , these higher - order random walks could be relevant for more general forms of dynamic stress transfer along a crack front , or other extended elastic objects .",
    "for instance , one can approach a fine - tuned critical point where the coefficients of the first and second time derivative terms are zero .",
    "then the third - order time derivative is the most relevant term , and we arrive at a higher - order critical point . while the time reparameterization given by eq .",
    "( 42 ) does not allow us to equate the avalanche size exponent with the first passage time exponent in this case , we remain optimistic that either exponent may be relevant for various physical systems .",

    "not only does the position spread faster than the velocity , but it also drifts with time with a coefficient that depends on the velocity .",
