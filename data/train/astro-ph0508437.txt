    "this allows us to observe most of the bright stars of ic 348 without overexposing the frames . with this exposure time",

    "after the calculation of differential magnitudes we applied the period98 , clean and scargle methods to obtain the periodograms .",

    "they detected different periods for this star in different seasons so they gave an average period for five seasons which is 16.40 d. there is a period change of 3@xmath0 for this star .",
    "this can be related with the chosen fourier step size which gives a maximum error of 0.7 d. hence , the stability of rotation periods of tt stars over long time scales is confirmed .",

    "therefore , star 94 did not show rotation period .",
    "for star 187 which is an a0 type star , we found a period of 6.097 d. since we do not expect a chromospheric activity that produce x - ray emission from this spectral type , no rotation period should be observed .",
    "it can be explained in the way as preibisch and zinnecker ( 2001 ) explained ; that is this rotation period is due to a very close late type companion it is not related with the star itself .",

    "the accretion activity is highly variable in time .",
    "the continuous activity of this star with its deep minima is seen clearly from the figure .",

    "the star 143 also shows similar variations like star 73 , showing a magnitude variations of about 1.4 mag . taking typical mass and radius of a k0 star we can calculate the mass accreted on to the star .",
    "if increase in luminosity is arising from the accretion from a disk which is comparable to that of gravitational contraction then a change of 0.7 in magnitude corresponds to a mass accretion rate of m@xmath27 gr / s .",

    "cohen et al .",
    "noted that stars may remain spotted but the spot pattern evolves such that a period can not be determined over 6 consecutive months of observation . since we detected the periods of these stars it is probably related with the number of data points used in the time series .",
    "if the size of the spot is small it can be difficult to detect the period .",
    "most of the stars whose periods were detected were wttss .",
    "the periods of non accreting wttss are easily detected .",
    "there were 7 non periodic wttss in our analysis .",
    "this may be due to a changing spot pattern or spot less period of the star during the observation .",
    "for one of them ( star 103 ) cohen et al . gives a period of 2.237 d which is an average over all of five seasons they studied .",
    "they could not find periodicity for two seasons for this star .",
    "the number of cttss that we study is less than wttss .",
    "for the 4 cttss ( 51 , 71 , 73 , 143 ) we detected rotation period",
    ". it would not be possible to detect the periods if the disk prevents the detection of rotational variability .",
    "prebisch @xmath2 zinneker ( 2002 ) noted that m type stars without any circumstellar material can show h@xmath3 emission .",
    "they may not have an accretion disk .",
    "h@xmath3 emission can also be time dependent in tt stars .",
    "these 4 stars may be seen as ctts at the time of measurement of h@xmath3 emission , but at another time h@xmath3 emission may be less and they may appear as wtts .",
    "the rotational periods found in this study are similar with those of cohen et al . with a maximum change of 1@xmath0 in period .",
    "small changes in the rotational periods indicate a rigid rotation .",
    "rotation periods seems to be stable on a timescale of @xmath76 yr in this cluster when evaluated together with the results of cohen et al .",
    "we found an inverse correlation between x - ray luminosity and the rotational period in our sample of late type ttss .",
    "x - ray luminosity decreases as the stars rotate slower .",
    "wttss and cttss bahave similar in x - ray activity at any rotational period .",
    "the dispersion in rotational periods at a given spectral type results in a dispersion in x - ray luminosity .",
    "we thank the referee prof .",
    "kevin luhman , for a careful reading and valuable comments .",
    "this project utilizes data obtained by the robotic optical transient search experiment .",
