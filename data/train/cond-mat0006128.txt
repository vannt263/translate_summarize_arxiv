    "according to modern theories of phase transitions based on the concept of scaling , the properties of the fluctuations associated with continuous phase transitions close to the critical temperature @xmath3 are determined by a single length scale which varies with temperature .",

    "additionally , a series of verneuil - grown samples has been investigated , an overview can be found in table  [ tab : samples ] , details with regard to the sample preparation are given in paper  i.    searching for the origin of the sharp component , which occurs essentially close to the surface of the samples  i @xcite and ii , first the depth dependence of strain , mosaicity and integrated reflecting power of these samples has been measured .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , the existence of point defects , in this case oxygen vacancies , changes the values of the critical exponents if the mean distance of the defects is smaller than the correlation length of the critical fluctuations .",
    "therefore the depth dependent concentration of the two - fold negatively charged oxygen vacancies has been investigated using impedance spectroscopy @xcite : as described in @xcite microelectrodes of different diameters can be used to analyse the depth dependence of the conductivity . using gold microelectrodes ( @xmath28@xmath7 m ) the conductivity measured at @xmath29c",
    "could be shown to be depth - independent in the top @xmath30@xmath7mof both samples i and ii .",
    "oxygen vacancies considerably contribute to the overall conductivity at these temperatures and the conductivity data can be transferred into oxygen vacancy concentration values @xcite .",
    "it can therefore be concluded that the vacancy concentration is depth - independent as well .",
    "consequently , the sharp component , which has been observed in sample  i up to a depth of @xmath31@xmath7 m @xcite , is not related to a gradient in the oxygen vacancy concentration .",
    "this is an important finding because the sharp component has only been found in the crystallographically rather perfect samples with relatively high concentrations of oxygen vacancies and not in the less perfect verneuil crystals with much lower oxygen vacancy concentrations . in the verneuil - grown samples the vacancy concentration of the bulk has been determined from conventional impedance measurements of the isolating as - grown and oxidised samples using the vacancy mobility @xcite and by hall - resistivity measurements for the almost metallic reduced sample .",
    "the results are summarised in table  [ tab : samples ] .",
    "the main focus of this paper is on sample  i , where a direct correlation between strain , lattice parameter variation and the occurrence of the sharp component in the critical scattering was observed in the surface near region up to a depth of @xmath31@xmath7 m , also using triple crystal diffractometry at energies of @xmath32kev @xcite .",

    "the residual plate has a thickness of @xmath37@xmath7 m , the material loss due to sawing and careful polishing of the two cut faces resulted to about @xmath34 mm . in figure",

    "the two surfaces c and d had been subject to the identical polishing treatment .",
    "region  e represents the bulk of the block .",
    "the depth dependent impedance measurements described above have been performed in region  a , at the original sample .    the depth dependence of the integrated intensity , the mosaicity and the variation of the lattice parameter has been measured at the ( @xmath10 ) main reflection around the phase transition temperature of @xmath39k for the different surfaces b  d and in the bulk  e of sample  i. in figure  [ fig : int_d ] the gain in the integrated intensity of the ( @xmath10 ) reflection in region  d compared to the intensity @xmath40 in the bulk ( region  e ) is plotted as a function of the distance to the surface of the residual block .",
    "the straight line is an exponential function @xmath41 fitted to the data .",
    "no temperature dependence can be observed , the mean @xmath42-length results to @xmath43@xmath7 m .",
    "the increase of intensity can be understood qualitatively on the basis of dynamical diffraction theory @xcite .",
    "the bulk mosaicity of the sample is determined by transverse scans in reciprocal space , it results to a fwhm of @xmath44  .",
    "the width of the ( @xmath10 ) reflection of an absolutely perfect srtio@xmath1-crystal at @xmath31kev is @xmath45  , i.e. the mosaicity is about a factor of @xmath46 larger than the dynamical width .",
    "this broadening is not an effect of the instrumental resolution but represents the intrinsic mosaic spread of the sample , which is still much smaller than in the other samples , especially the verneuil grown samples with mosaic spreads of @xmath47  .",
    "the integrated reflectivity in the bulk expected for a perfect crystal can be calculated for negligible absorption using dynamical theory .",
    "one obtains @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the transmitted intensity behind the sample in the anguar range where no bragg scattering occurs , i.e.  the effect of absorption is eliminated . in the bulk ( region",
    "e ) the measured integrated reflectivity @xmath50 was about @xmath51 times larger than the theoretical value for a perfect crystal .",
    "this is consistent with the increase in the mosaic spread .",
    "however , using the kinematical scattering theory , the expected integrated reflectivity of the @xmath52 mm thick sample should be @xmath53 .",
    "thus the diffraction mechanism in the bulk of this sample is close to the expectations for a perfect crystal , which has been shown before by means of @xmath54-ray diffraction experiments @xcite .",
    "close to the surface the mosaic spread of the sample increases [ fig .",
    "[ fig : char ] ] , and therefore the scattering process has to be described more and more by kinematical scattering theory , which explains the increase of the integrated reflectivity , shown in figure  [ fig : int_d ] .",

    "the identical characterisation of the crystallographic properties was carried out for the platelet ( regions b and c ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : int_bc ] shows the data of the integrated intensity in the platelet and simultaneously the width ( hwhm ) of the longitudinal scans , i.e.  the lattice parameter variation , at a temperature of @xmath59k . on the left side of the figure , which corresponds to region  b , the behaviour is identical to that in region  d , shown in figure  [ fig : int_d ] . within the errorbars ,",
    "the @xmath42-length ( @xmath60@xmath7 m ) is the same .",
    "but , surprisingly , the other surface of the plate ( region  c ) does not show any effect , neither for the integrated intensity , nor for the widths of longitudinal and transverse scans .",
    "in fact , the integrated reflectivity is identical to the bulk value in region  e , whereas the variation of the lattice parameter , @xmath61 is slightly enhanced compared to the bulk value .",
    "these results are also summarised in figure  [ fig : char ] .",
    "the intrinsic mosaicity of the platelet could not be determined within these measurements because the platelet turned out to be bent . due to the relatively large width of the beam spot , the signal results from an overlap of different regions in the bent sample , which enhances the width of the transverse scans .",
    "consequently , the width of the transverse scans at a given spot is a measure of the bending radius of the plate and not a measure of the intrinsic mosaicity",
    ". a more accurate determination of the bending radius was achieved by using a narrow cross - section of the beam , e.g.  @xmath62@xmath7m@xmath63 , and measuring the shift of the position of a main reflection depending on the position in real space on the plate , which was oriented perpendicular to the beam . using this technique , a real - space picture of the plate",
    "can be reconstructed from the data [ fig .",
    "[ fig : scheibe ] ] .",
    "the bending of the lattice planes is almost spherical , the bending radius results to @xmath64 m . in this figure ,",
    "region  c corresponds to the upper , concave side , i.e.  the lower , convex side corresponds to region  b. using an optical microscope it could be seen that not only the lattice planes are bent but the platelet itself is bent macroscopically .",
    "it should be mentioned that the bending has been observed not directly after the polishing process but after the first low temperature measurements , i.e. after the platelet had undergone the structural phase transition .",
    "thus it is not clear if the bending process took place directly after the polishing process or some weeks later after cooling through the transition .",
    "supplementary to the depth dependent measurements with @xmath31kev photons , the surfaces b  d have been investigated in bragg geometry with a photon energy of @xmath65kev on a triple - axis diffractometer at the hasylab beamline d4 @xcite .",
    "the absorption length at this energy was determined to @xmath66@xmath7 m , i.e.  the relevant contribution to the bragg peaks results from the surface near region of some ten microns thickness . in figure",
    "[ fig : d4 ] the scattering profiles of the ( @xmath67 ) bragg reflection are shown for the three surfaces b , c and d both in linear scale and in logarithmic scale ( inset ) . at the surface of the residual block ( region  d ) a difference between the center of the surface and the edge region of the surface was found .",
    "it can be seen , that regions b and d ( center ) show much broader bragg peaks than region  c and the edge of the residual block ( d edge ) . additionally , the integrated intensity of the respective scans is shown in the legend .",
    "consistent with the observations described above , the values are increased at surfaces b ( @xmath68 ) and d ( @xmath69 ) , compared to surface c ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "however , interestingly the edge region of the residual block shows a similar behaviour as the cut surface of the plate ( region  c ) .",
    "the characterisation of the crystallographic quantities in sample  i can be summarised as follows : the residual floatzone grown block consists of an almost perfect bulk ( region  e ) surrounded by a layer ( region  d ) of increased mosaicity and increased lattice parameter variations . both mosaicity and lattice parameter variation increase exponentially with an 1/e - length of @xmath71@xmath7 m approaching the surface",
    "this behaviour is identical to the depth dependence of the experimental data from the original sample before the cut ( region  a ) , presented in @xcite , and supports the interpretations of the earlier @xmath54-ray diffraction experiments on the same sample in @xcite .",
    "however , the region  d close to the surface of the residual block , which has been inside the almost perfect bulk of the sample before the cut , strongly changed its crystallographic properties after cutting and polishing the surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the cut surface of the residual plate , i.e.  region  c shows no effects in the mosaicity or the integrated reflectivity .",
    "the values are the same as those of the bulk ( region  e ) , only a slightly enhanced value of the lattice parameter variations is observed .",
    "in spite of the identical treatment of surfaces  c and d , large differences are observed .",
    "the behaviour of the untreated surface of the plate , region  b , remains unchanged compared to the earlier measurements at region  a.    the only explanation for the observed difference in the behaviour of regions  c and d can be given by the fact that the plate became bent after the cut . assuming that the original sample included long range strain fields inside the bulk , possibly introduced by the growth process",
    ", a relaxation of these strain fields is not possible in the residual block because of its dimensions and the high crystallographic perfection . in region",
    "d , close to the surface of the residual block , these strain fields lead to an increased mosaicity and increased lattice parameter variations in the center of the surface , but not in the edge regions of the surface of the residual block because here the strain fields are able to relax .",
    "similarly the relaxation of the strain fields is observed in the platelet .",
    "the existing strain gradient in the platelet , experimentally determined at region  a in @xcite , is able to relax by bending the whole thin sample .",
    "hence , in region  c no dislocations like in region  d are observed , the crystallographic parameters remain unchanged compared to the bulk behaviour . however , the other surface , region  b , still is full of dislocations and thus also does not change its general behaviour . due to the large dimensions of the crystal , this bending process of course is not possible at the surface of the residual block , in region  d.    similar measurements",
    "have been carried out on sample  ii , it can be seen that the surface of sample  ii qualitatively shows the same behaviour like the regions  a , b and d of sample  i. the mosaicity of sample  ii is about one order of magnitude larger than that of sample  i , but it is still much better than the mosaic spreads of 30 - 100  of the verneuil - grown crystals .",
    "the depth dependence of the crystallographic parameters of the verneuil - grown crystals has not been investigated .",
    "essential for the discussion of critical behaviour and the determination of critical exponents is the accurate measurement of the critical temperature . following the procedure of riste et al .",
    "@xcite , the temperature dependence of the integrated intensity of a superlattice reflection has been measured both below and above the phase transition . the scattered intensity at this position is proportional to the square of the order parameter , @xmath72 .",
    "unfortunately , just below @xmath3 both the critical fluctuations @xmath73 and the static part @xmath74 contribute to the signal . above @xmath3",
    "the critical fluctuations give rise to a tail in the temperature dependence of the order parameter [ figure  [ fig : tails ] ] .",
    "as described in paper  i , we have neglected the contribution of static order parameter clusters , which do also exist above @xmath3 . using the landau approximation ,",
    "the susceptibilitiy at @xmath75 is a factor of @xmath25 smaller than the susceptibility at @xmath76 [ see e.g.  @xcite ] .",
    "this relation is used to substract the contribution of the fluctuations below @xmath3 as described in @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the residual data @xmath77 can be fitted with a power law : @xmath78 in order to maximise the compatibility of the critical temperatures @xmath3 , the critical exponent @xmath79 was fixed to @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "slight changes in @xmath79 were allowed to determine the error bars of the critical temperatures .",
    "the results for the critical temperature in the bulk of the various samples are summarised in table  [ tab : samples ] .",
    "the value @xmath81k for sample  i has been determined in the bulk of the original sample . usually , in literature , the critical temperature of the structural phase transition in srtio@xmath1 averages to about @xmath0k .",
    "this value is similar to the value for the two verneuil samples with low oxygen vacancy concentrations .",
    "it has been shown earlier , that an increased amount of oxygen vacancies reduces the critical temperature @xcite , the reduced verneuil sample nicely reproduces the results .",
    "however , the shift in the critical temperature for the two highly perfect samples  i and ii is much too large compared to the experimentally determined concentration of oxygen vacancies .",
    "the origin of this observation is not clear yet , perhaps the high degree of perfection of samples  i and ii is responsible for the low transition temperature . as pointed out by zhong et al .",
    "@xcite , the existence of quantum fluctuations leads to a significant decrease of the critical temperature of about @xmath65k .",
    "it might be speculated that the quantum fluctuations show a stronger effect in the more perfect samples than in the worse verneuil samples , which leads to an additional decrease of the phase transition temperature .    in analogy to the crystallographic characterisations described above , the depth dependence of the critical temperature has been investigated in detail in sample  i. the results are plotted in figure  [ fig : tc ] . both the transition temperatures before and after the cut are shown .",
    "as to be expected no changes in @xmath3 are observed in region  e , the bulk of the sample . in the original sample",
    "two features can be identified : over a large range the critical temperature is decreasing and close to the surface , in region  a , a slightly enhanced value for @xmath3 is found .",
    "the latter observation is similar to the behaviour at the surface of the residual block , region  d. there also a slight increase in the critical temperature is found very close to the surface ( @xmath82@xmath7 m ) .",
    "however , in the residual plate the general trend is unclear .",
    "@xmath83@xmath7mbelow the cut surface ( region  c ) of the plate , @xmath3 is identical to the bulk value ( region  e ) , but at both surfaces , regions  b and c , the critical temperature decreases substantially . comparing these observations with the results of the crystallographic characterisation",
    ", it can be concluded that two different effects have to be distinguished .",
    "on one hand , the probably large amount of dislocations and other defects , which are not yet identified , in region  a is responsible for the large difference in the transition temperatures found in the bulk and near the surface of the original block . on the other hand",
    ", it seems that the strain fields in its surface near region increase the transition temperatures slightly .",
    "this is observed in region  a and region  d , but not in region  c , where the strain fields are absent .",
    "after the relaxation of the strain gradient in the plate , the critical temperature in region  c is close to the bulk value ( region  e ) . in region",
    "b @xmath3 strongly declines almost to the low value observed at the original surface ( region  a ) .",
    "another interesting result of the measurements is the behaviour of the tails of the order parameter above the critical temperatures . in order to compare the tails for the different samples ,",
    "the integrated intensities of the superlattice reflection have been normalised to the respective scaling factor of the fitted power law , i.e.  the extrapolated value at zero temperature .",
    "also , the temperature is replaced by the reduced temperature @xmath84 . using this method , the effect of the stronger",
    ", more kinematical scattering at the surface [ see section  [ sec : sam ] ] is cancelled out and all curves except one coincide below the transition temperature , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : tails ] .",
    "the additional information derived from this kind of presentation is the similarity of the temperature dependence of the tails above the critical temperatures . in the residual block [ fig .",
    "[ fig : tails]a ] , all data points follow the same trend above @xmath3 , i.e.   the nature of the tails is not connected to the observed strain gradients at the surface",
    ". moreover , the tails are identical in the residual block and in the residual plate [ fig .",
    "[ fig : tails]b ] , only the old surface of the plate , region  b , shows a significantly enhanced amount of scattering above @xmath3 .",
    "certainly , this has to be attributed to the large amount of dislocations and/or other defects in this region .",
    "the critical scattering has been observed at the position of the ( @xmath10)/2 superlattice reflection in the samples  i and ii and at the position of the ( @xmath85)/2 superlattice reflection in the verneuil samples . in most cases , after deconvolution of the experimental resolution [ see appendix  [ sec : app ] ] the scattering profile could be fitted with a single lorentzian distribution function and as a result the inverse correlation length @xmath86 and the susceptibility @xmath87 of the broad component in the critical scattering could be extracted . plotting this as a function of temperature it is possible to deduce the values of the critical exponents @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which has been discussed in detail in paper  i. in this paper , we want to focus on the sharp component , which has been observed only in samples  i and ii in surface near regions . in those cases the scattering profile had to be fitted with a sum of a lorentzian and a lorentzian - squared profile , i.e.  two additional parameters , the inverse correlation length @xmath90 and the susceptibility @xmath91 , have to be taken into account ( the peak - position of the two contributions turned out to be identical ) .",
    "a typical example of a measured scattering profile is shown in figure  [ fig : typical ] .",
    "the lorentzian - squared part is much narrower than the lorentzian contribution , which is the reason for calling it the sharp component .    at a temperature about @xmath34k above @xmath3 the depth dependence of the critical scattering profile in the residual block of sample",
    "i is shown in figure  [ fig : depth_block ] . in the top @xmath65@xmath7 m ,",
    "corresponding to region  d , the additional sharp component is clearly visible . in the inset",
    ", the same data are plotted over a wider angular range in logarithmic scale .",
    "this is to stress the observation that the broad component is independent of the location of the probed volume element in the sample .",
    "the scattering only differs in the central region , where the sharp component dominates .",
    "the temperature dependence of the inverse correlation length for the broad component was identical at all investigated positions in sample  i after the cut .",
    "the values @xmath88 and @xmath89 for the critical exponents of the broad component in the different samples and for the various positions in the samples are summarised in table  [ tab : broad ] .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , the absolute values depend on the concentration of the oxygen vacancies .",
    "however , all values of the critical exponents related to the broad component can be explained in terms of the influence of order parameter clusters , the universal behaviour is not restricted . for the different positions in sample  i the critical exponents for the broad component are almost identical , i.e.  the occurrence of the sharp component as well as the increased mosaicity and lattice parameter variations do not affect the behaviour of the broad component . in table",
    "[ tab : broad ] also the validity of some scaling relations is checked ( @xmath92 , @xmath79 , @xmath54 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the well - known critical exponents , @xmath95 is the dimensionality of the system , in this case @xmath96 ) .",
    "@xmath97 the value of @xmath94 is very small ( @xmath98 ) for srtio@xmath1 @xcite , i.e.  the ratio @xmath99 should be close to @xmath25 . especially the verneuil - samples almost perfectly fulfill this condition , overall this scaling relation holds quite nicely in all cases . using relation  ( [ eq : scale2 ] )",

    "apparently , the width of the sharp component in region  b is much broader than the respective width in region  d. furthermore , almost no signal of the sharp component is visible in region  c. the profiles for regions  c and d are identical except for a narrow region in the center of the scan , which is due to the sharp component . in figure  [ fig : crit_sharp ] the plots from which the critical exponents @xmath101 [ fig .",

    "[ fig : crit_sharp]b ] have been determined are shown for the four positions where the sharp component was observed .",
    "again , the old surface of the cut - off plate , region  b , strongly differs from all other data sets .",
    "the resulting values for the critical exponents of the sharp component are listed in table  [ tab : sharp ] .",
    "the strong deviation of the behaviour in region  b is obvious , the second length scale in the three other regions is described by similar critical exponents .",
    "interestingly , the ratio @xmath103 is noticeable larger than @xmath25 , more likely close to @xmath104 .",
    "the validity of scaling relations for the sharp component could be established , if the intensity of the sharp component is not proportional to the susceptibility but to the square of the susceptibility , as it is also the case e.g.  for huang - scattering @xcite .",
    "the two functions @xmath105 and @xmath106 only differ by the definition of the respective susceptibility . all critical exponents discussed so far have been derived using equation  ( [ eq : lorentzsquared_alt ] ) . however , assuming a lorentzian distribution and using the latter definition , the susceptibility @xmath91 is replaced by @xmath107 . as a result the value of the critical exponent is reduced by a factor of two , @xmath108 and the ratio @xmath109 is close to two , fulfilling the scaling relation  ( [ eq : scale1 ] ) .",
    "concluding , the sharp component in the critical scattering in srtio@xmath1 occurs in surface near regions ( some ten microns ) of highly perfect crystals , but not if long range strain fields are absent in this region .",
    "the temperature dependence of the correlation length and the susceptibility can be described with critical exponents , which do fulfill scaling relations if a definition of the scattering profile different from current convention is applied .",
    "the occurrence of the sharp component does not affect the critical behaviour of the broad component in any manner .",
    "we have investigated the critical scattering above the @xmath0k structural phase transition of srtio@xmath1 . the main focus is put on the dependence of the critical phenomena on the depth below the surface . in order to interpret the results concerning the critical scattering , the crystallographic perfection was analysed with high momentum- and real - space resolution especially in the regions close to the surfaces .",
    "particularly we concentrated on the differences of several surfaces of a highly perfect sample .    as a result",
    "it is observed that one necessary condition for the existence of two length scales in the critical scattering is the vicinity ( some ten microns ) of the surface of a sample .",
    "another necessary condition is the existence of strain fields in this region , experimentally demonstrated by the increase of lattice parameter variations and mosaicity close to the surface .",
    "however , in samples of lower quality , i.e.  with strongly enhanced mosaic spreads the sharp component is suppressed significantly compared to that found in the highly perfect crystals .",
    "possibly the long range order of the critical fluctuations is destroyed by the high amount of topological defects in samples of very high mosaicity .",
    "starting with the bulk of sample  i , region  e , no sharp component can be observed , because it is not a surface near region . in region",
    "d , both conditions are fulfilled .",
    "both mosaicity and the variation of the lattice parameter , as well as the critical temperature , increase exponentially approaching the surface and the exisitence of long range strain fields at this surface seems reasonable . simultaneously , also the intensity of the sharp component increases ,",
    "while the broad component remains unaffected .",
    "region  c consists of an almost perfect crystal , where the strain fields were able to relax by bending of the lattice planes .",
    "thus , no sharp component is observed and the critical temperature is close to the bulk value . on the other hand , region  b ,",
    "the `` old '' surface of the plate , still is full of dislocations and probably other unspecified defects . here",
    ", both conditions for the appearence of the sharp component are fulfilled , but different from the surface of the residual block , region  d , a lot of dislocations exist at this surface stemming from the frequent use over more than twenty years in many experiments . moreover , the bending of the lattice planes additionally deteriorated the crystallographic perfection , because unlike the other almost perfect surface no relaxation was possible at this surface .",
    "the development of long range correlations at this surface is suppressed or , at least , affected .",
    "the result is the large deviation in the values of the critical exponents for the sharp component in region  b , compared to the earlier results on the same surface before the cut , called region  a. the behaviour of sample  ii at the surface is very similar to the behaviour of sample  i in region  d. the surface of sample  ii was cut , polished and etched , as described in paper  i. afterwards in the surface near region mosaicity , lattice parameter variation and the intensity of the sharp component increased simultaneously .",
    "compared to the two almost perfect samples the intensity of the sharp component in the verneuil - grown samples iii - v is suppressed by about three orders of magnitude , i.e.  no evaluation of critical exponents for this component was possible .",
    "this is due to the large mosaicity , which suppresses the long range correlation comparable to the effect at the old surface of the plate ( region  b ) .",
    "qualitatively , it has been shown before that at distorted surfaces the intensity of the sharp component is reduced @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "long range strain fields in the vicinity of the surface seem to be responsible for the second length scale in the critical scattering of srtio@xmath1 .",
    "these long range strain fields can spread out much better in almost perfect crystals , dislocations and other topological defects reduce the strain fields and affect the critical exponents and eventually lead to complete suppression of the second length scale .",
    "similar to the usual critical fluctuations , the temperature dependence of the long range correlations can be described with a set of critical exponents , also we presented indications for the validity of scaling laws",
    ". however , the distribution of defects in the surface near region is crucial for the formation of the sharp component and for the values of the critical exponents describing this phenomenon .",
    "this interpretation of the nature of the sharp component is consistent with the ideas of cowley @xcite , who suggested that at the surface the coupling of strain fields to the order parameter might lead to free surface waves with a higher effective transition temperature than the bulk fluctuations .",
    "the sharp component is then attributed to the free surface fluctuations .",
    "unfortunately , no quantitative calculations on the basis of this approach have been performed yet .",
    "further theoretical work is needed for a full quantitative understanding of the nature of the second length scale in the critical scattering .",

    "in order to extract the correlation length and the susceptibility from the experimental data , first the experimental resolution function had to be determined . the deconvolution procedure is based on the paper by hirota et al .",
    "@xcite . in the scattering plane ,",
    "the resolution function was determined experimentally at the position of the superstructure reflection a few degrees below the transition temperature [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : resolution ] ] . from these scans we extracted the widths in the longitudinal ( @xmath110 ) and in transvere ( @xmath111 ) directions and the shape of the respective scattering profiles . in most cases ,",
    "the shape of the superstructure peak was a lorentzian - squared profile .",
    "the functional form of the resolution element was approximated by : @xmath112 for the investigated samples this approximation is in very good agreement with the correct resolution function , the theoretical calculation is explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "perpendicular to the scattering plane , the resolution is determined by the opening of the vertical slits , substantially by the widths of the slits in front of the sample ( @xmath113 ) and in front of the detector ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "these widths have to be transformed to the @xmath115-space using the distance @xmath116 between sample and detector and the value of the wavevector @xmath117 : @xmath118 the resolution element @xmath119 is now given by the convolution of two rectangular profiles , which is a trapezoidal function , as shown in figure  [ fig : trapez ] : @xmath120{r@{\\quad\\forall\\quad}r } 0&|q_z|\\ge q_1\\\\ \\frac{|q_z|-q_1}{q_2-q_1}&q_2<|q_z|<q_1\\\\ 1&|q_z|\\le q_2        \\end{array}\\right .",

    "we used an additional isotropic lorentziansquared function to fit the experimental data .",
    "@xmath124 according to @xcite , the lorentzian contribution shows an anisotropy , the inverse correlation lengths @xmath125 in ( @xmath31)-directions are a factor of @xmath126 smaller than the widths @xmath127 in ( @xmath128)-directions . in our experiments the scattering geometry was such that @xmath129 ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) and @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) , i.e.  all three directions are slightly tilted with respect to the main axes .",
    "for simplicity we assumed @xmath134 , probably slightly underestimating the correct inverse correlation length .",
    "the integration in @xmath135 in equation  ( [ eq : i_krit_falt ] ) was performed analytically . using the symmetry of the resolution function , the integral reduces to @xmath136 the integral consist of four parts , two addends for both the lorentzian @xmath137 and the lorentziansquared contribution @xmath138 .",
    "now we define @xmath139 and set @xmath140 , because we are only looking at the intensity in the scattering plane . the result for the lorentzian part",
    "can be written as @xmath141 where @xmath142 equation ( [ eq : lor_part ] ) can be simplified to : @xmath143 similarly the integration of the lorentziansquared part yields : @xmath144 the remaining calculations , @xmath145 have been evaluated numerically , using the approximation ( [ eq : aufl_exp ] ) for the resolution element in the scattering plane , and were compared to experimental data @xmath146 for transverse scans or @xmath147 for longitudinal scans in every step of the fitting procedure .    in order to check the validity of the theoretical calcuations , two different values for the vertical resolution",
