    "the possibility that a curved ( pseudo - riemannian ) geometry of spacetime can be mimicked by fluid dynamics in minkowski spacetime has been recently exploited in various contexts including emergent gravity @xcite , scalar theory of gravity @xcite , acoustic geometry @xcite to name but a few .",
    "the basic idea is the emergence of an effective metric of the form @xmath0 which describes the effective geometry for acoustic perturbations propagating in a perfect fluid potential flow with @xmath1 . the background spacetime metric @xmath2 is usually assumed flat and the coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related to the equation of state of the fluid and the adiabatic speed of sound .",
    "equivalently , in a field - theoretical picture the fluid velocity @xmath5 is derived from the scalar field as @xmath6 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are expressed in terms of the lagrangian and its first and second derivatives with respect to the kinetic energy term @xmath7 .    in a slightly different context",
    ", the metric of the form ( [ eq1a ] ) has been used to show that a pseudo - riemann spacetime with lorentz signature may be derived from a riemann metric with euclidean signature @xcite . in that case",
    ", the vector @xmath5 represents the normalized gradient of a hypothetical scalar field which governs the dynamics and the signature of the effective spacetime .",
    "the effective geometry of an expanding fluid seems a promising route to model an expanding spacetime , e.g. , of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) type .",
    "however , an expanding fluid alone is not a sufficiently powerful tool for modeling an expanding spacetime of general relativity . at best , the fluid flow can be manipulated to provide a coordinate transformation to an arbitrary curved coordinate frame , with the spacetime remaining flat .",
    "for example , a boost - invariant bjorken - type spherical expansion provides a map of the minkowski to the milne spacetime  a homogeneous , isotropic , expanding universe with the cosmological scale proportional to @xmath8 and negative spatial curvature @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a mechanism in which the metric ( [ eq1a ] ) provides a laboratory model for an analog frw spacetime with arbitrary spatial curvature . to model an arbitrary frw spacetime we make use of the effective acoustic geometry in which small perturbations propagate adiabatically .",
    "we show quite generally that in addition to an appropriately designed fluid expansion it is necessary to manipulate the fluid equation of state to obtain the desired geometry . by making use of a specific type of fluid expansion in minkowski spacetime it is possible quite generally to map the minkowski metric into spatially closed ( @xmath9 ) , open hyperbolic ( @xmath10 ) , or open flat ( @xmath11 ) frw acoustic metrics .",
    "the mappings to spatially flat and hyperbolic universes have been already studied in a few specific applications , such as spatially flat analog cosmology in a non - relativistic bose - einstein ( be ) condensate @xcite and an open frw metric in a bjorken - like spherical expansion of a relativistic be system @xcite and of a hadronic fluid @xcite .",
    "we extend these ideas to a more general case that includes all three types of frw spatial geometries .",
    "it turns out that an open frw spacetime with zero or negative spatial curvature can be modeled in a rather straightforward way using isentropic perfect fluids such as a bose - einstein condensate in the thomas - fermi limit .",
    "the modeling of a closed frw spacetime with positive spatial curvature requires additional assumptions .",
    "we divide the remainder of the paper into five sections and an appendix starting with section [ spacetimes ] , in which we give a field - theoretical description of our model . in the following section , section [ bose ] , we study the relativistic",
    "be condensate in the context of analog cosmology .",
    "section [ hydrodynamic ] reproduces the results of section [ spacetimes ] in terms of the conventional relativistic hydrodynamics . in section [ analog ]",
    "we study the analog cosmological horizons and we present the spacetime diagrams for the analog de sitter universe .",
    "we summarize our results and give a brief outlook in section [ discussion ] .",
    "finally , in appendix [ coordinate ] we describe a general transformation from minkowski to spatially curved conformal coordinates .",
    "we start with an expanding perfect fluid in minkowski spacetime in spherical coordinates @xmath12 , @xmath13 and we demand that the effective acoustic metric in comoving coordinates @xmath14 takes the conformal frw form with line element @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the ( generally time - dependent ) speed of sound and the curvature @xmath17 is positive , zero , or negative for a spacetime with spherical , flat , and hyperbolic spatial geometry , respectively . to achieve this we first design the fluid flow so that it models a transformation from minkowski to conformal coordinates @xmath14 using the prescription of ibison @xcite , which we review in appendix [ coordinate ] . in the next section",
    "we describe the kinematics of the fluid flow suitable for modeling an frw spacetime .      applying the transformation ( [ eq005])([eq006 ] )",
    ", we arrive at the line element @xmath18 where @xmath19 is given by ( [ eq007 ] ) .",
    "the particular choice @xmath20 in ( [ eq007 ] ) gives @xmath21 the new temporal and radial coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath22 and the spatial curvature radius @xmath23 are measured in units of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a yet unspecified mass scale .",
    "hence , in units of @xmath26 the curvature equals @xmath27 , 0 , or @xmath28 .",
    "since the conformal factor @xmath29 is a function of both @xmath8 and @xmath22 , the line element ( [ eq1004 ] ) is generally not frw .",
    "however , for @xmath10 , the expression for @xmath3 may be simplified by taking the limit @xmath30 in ( [ eq007 ] ) , in which case we obtain @xmath3 as a function of @xmath8 only , @xmath31 where @xmath32 may take the value @xmath33 or @xmath28 , corresponding to an expanding or collapsing universe , respectively .",
    "the fluid which provides the desired map ( [ eq005])([eq006 ] ) from @xmath34 to @xmath35 coordinates is required to be at rest in @xmath35 coordinates .",
    "in other words the expansion of the fluid is such that the new coordinate frame @xmath35 is comoving , i.e. , the four - velocity of the flow in the new coordinate frame is @xmath36 hence , the inverse transformation of ( [ eq005])([eq006 ] ) applied to ( [ eq1115 ] ) yields the velocity components @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the original minkowski frame .",
    "expressed in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath22 these components are given by ( [ eq015 ] ) and ( [ eq016 ] ) .",
    "specifically , for @xmath39 we have @xmath40 @xmath41    again , for @xmath10 we may take the limit @xmath42 and the expressions ( [ eq015 ] ) and ( [ eq016 ] ) reduce to @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath32 equals @xmath33 or @xmath28 , corresponding to an expanding or collapsing fluid , respectively .",
    "these velocities describe a spherically symmetric bjorken - type expansion .",
    "this type of expansion has been recently applied to mimic an open frw metric in a relativistic be system @xcite and in a hadronic fluid @xcite .",
    "the above discussed limit @xmath30 that removes the @xmath22-dependence of the scale factor in ( [ eq1004 ] ) does not work for @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "however , as we will shortly demonstrate , with the appropriate choice of the fluid lagrangian we can eliminate @xmath22-dependence even for a more general expansion of the form ( [ eq013 ] ) and ( [ eq014 ] ) applicable to any @xmath47 or @xmath28 .    next , we derive a lagrangian that describes a fluid capable of modeling frw spacetime in terms of the relativistic acoustic geometry .      for our purpose",
    "it proves advantageous to use the field - theoretical description of fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "consider a lagrangian @xmath48 that depends on a dimensionless scalar field @xmath49 and on the kinetic energy term @xmath50 for @xmath51 , the energy - momentum tensor @xmath52 takes the perfect fluid form @xmath53 in which @xmath54 hence , the field @xmath49 serves as the velocity potential .",

    "we find @xmath84 a further restriction on the fluid functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 is imposed by the field equation ( [ eq400 ] ) .",
    "applying ( [ eq400 ] ) to ( [ eq3113 ] ) with @xmath87 , we obtain @xmath88 by inspection it may be verified that this equation , besides the trivial solution @xmath89 , has a solution that satisfies @xmath90 where @xmath91 is an arbitrary dimensionless constant .",
    "eliminating @xmath76 from ( [ eq3113 ] ) by ( [ eq402 ] ) and using ( [ eq4003 ] ) , ( [ eq4004 ] ) , and ( [ eq3111 ] ) we find @xmath92 then , the acoustic line element corresponding to the metric ( [ eq243b ] ) takes the desired form @xmath93 where a transition to the conformal time is made by the replacement @xmath94 . with a convenient choice @xmath95",
    "the cosmological scale factor reads @xmath96 in this way , we have shown that the acoustic analog metric takes the conformal form of a general frw spacetime with positive , negative or zero spatial curvature depending on the choice of @xmath17 in the flow velocity ( [ eq013])([eq014 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the cosmological scale is determined by the shape of the potential @xmath76 in the lagrangian ( [ eq3113 ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to study a few simple examples .",
    "the simplest possible case is the analog static spacetime with potential @xmath97 , i.e. , with the lagrangian @xmath98 it is worth noting that an effective lagrangian of this form has been recently studied in the context of relativistic superfluidity @xcite . from ( [ eq402 ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath99 .",
    "hence , if the fluid described by the lagrangian ( [ eq4000 ] ) expands according to ( [ eq013])([eq014 ] ) ( or ( [ eq017])([eq018 ] ) in the @xmath10 case ) , a comoving observer perceives a static open ( @xmath10 ) or closed ( @xmath9 ) analog universe .",

    "as demonstrated by ibison @xcite , the transformation ( [ eq005])([eq006 ] ) with @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 takes the ds line element in the @xmath11 representation @xmath113 to that in the @xmath112 representations of the type ( [ eq3025 ] ) with @xmath114 hence , the inverse coordinate transformation back to the original minkowski coordinates takes our acoustic line element ( [ eq3025 ] ) with ( [ eq003 ] ) to the conformal spatially flat ds line element ( [ eq002 ] ) , as it should because , by our construction , the acoustic metric of the fluid at rest ( i.e. , with @xmath11 velocity field ) described by the potential ( [ eq2006 ] ) is @xmath11 de sitter in the conformal form .      anti  de sitter ( ads ) spacetime is expressible only in the @xmath115 representation with line element @xcite @xmath116 repeating the above procedure , we find @xmath117",
    "in the context of relativistic acoustic geometry , an interesting example of a relativistic fluid is the be condensate which has been suggested in a recent paper @xcite as a model for an analogue frw universe .    we first show that , under certain assumptions , self - interacting complex scalar field theories are equivalent to purely kinetic @xmath17-essence models ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "we will then analyze the acoustic metric and demonstrate that an appropriately chosen @xmath17-essence lagrangian can simulate arbitrary @xmath11 and @xmath10 frw model .",
    "as for @xmath9 , purely kinetic @xmath17-essence lagrangians are not suitable for the simulation of @xmath10 frw models except for a closed static universe , as in the first example of section [ lagrangian ] .",

    "is called the relativistic bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the field configuration thus obtained corresponds to a two - component relativistic fluid .",
    "the formalism of acoustic geometry is derived assuming a perfect irrotational fluid . here",
    ", the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ eq1101 ] ) represents a combination of two perfect fluids and generally can not be put in the form of a single perfect fluid .",
    "however , if the spacetime variations of @xmath131 are small on the scale smaller than @xmath24 , i.e. assuming @xmath132 , then the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation @xcite ( or the eikonal approximation @xcite ) applies . in this case , if @xmath133 the fluid becomes perfect and the corresponding lagrangian is equivalent to a lagrangian that depends only on the kinetic term @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "this may be seen as follows .",
    "the tf approximation amounts to neglecting the kinetic term @xmath134 in ( [ eq2101 ] ) , in which case the lagrangian becomes @xmath135 the field equation ( [ eq2206 ] ) remains the same , whereas ( [ eq2207 ] ) reduces to @xmath136 now , the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ eq1103 ] ) takes the perfect fluid form ( [ eq019 ] ) with ( [ eq4012 ] ) and @xmath137 obviously , the perfect - fluid description applies only if @xmath138 which , generally , need not be true for the entire range @xmath139 .",
    "hence , the be fluid in the tf approximation is perfect for those @xmath140 for which @xmath133 .",

    "however , one should bare in mind that the field theories described by the lagrangians ( [ eq1103 ] ) and ( [ eq1105 ] ) , respectively , are equivalent only at the classical level .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor constructed from ( [ eq1105 ] ) is of the form ( [ eq019 ] ) , with the parametric equation of state @xmath145 this equation is just a different parametrization of the equation of state ( [ eq1216 ] ) which may be easily verified by using ( [ eq1204 ] ) to substitute @xmath129 for @xmath58 in ( [ eq1316 ] ) .    in the following",
    "we study an expanding fluid in terms of the lagrangian @xmath143 as a framework for an analog model of an frw universe .",
    "as before , the effective geometry in comoving coordinates is defined by the acoustic metric ( [ eq243b ] ) . however , the previous procedure of eliminating @xmath29 in the conformal factor can not be applied here , which describes a static analog universe as in the first example of section [ lagrangian ] . ] , since @xmath143 is now a general function of @xmath58 .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of hyperbolic spatial geometry ( @xmath10 ) the general coordinate transformation ( [ eq005 ] ) and ( [ eq006 ] ) to comoving coordinates may be simplified taking the limit @xmath30 . in this case the transformation ( [ eq317])([eq318 ] ) takes the minkowski spacetime to the milne spacetime with the conformal factor @xmath146 being a function of @xmath8 only .",

    "therefore , by choosing an appropriate interaction potential @xmath119 ( or equivalently , a @xmath17-essence lagrangian @xmath143 ) one can , in principle , mimic the open hyperbolic frw universe of arbitrary kind .",

    "furthermore , if we identify @xmath212 and choose @xmath213 as before , the acoustic line element ( [ eq025 ] ) takes precisely the same conformal frw form ( [ eq3025 ] ) with ( [ eq3026 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the cosmological scale is determined by the function @xmath192 that appears in the expression ( [ eq2014 ] ) for the particle number density .",
    "in this section we derive the expressions for the hubble and the apparent horizons for a general analog frw spacetime such as that in sections [ spacetimes ] and [ hydrodynamic ] . the frw line element considered here",
    "is assumed to be in the conformal form ( [ eq3025 ] ) , with the acoustic conformal time @xmath214 . the proper distance @xmath215 and the comoving spatial distance @xmath22 are related by @xmath216 as usual , whereas the analog hubble expansion rate in conformal coordinates is given by @xmath217 where the overdot denotes a partial derivative with respect to @xmath102 .",
    "we define the _ analog hubble horizon _ as a two - dimensional spherical surface at which the magnitude of the analog recession velocity @xmath218 equals the maximally allowed velocity of sound , @xmath219 .",
    "hence , the condition @xmath220 defines the location of the analog hubble horizon .",
    "next we define the _ analog apparent horizon _ as a boundary of the analog trapped region @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the apparent horizon is defined as a two - dimensional surface on which one of the null expansions vanishes @xcite . in the case of spherical symmetry one can use a more practical definition :",
    "the apparent horizon is a two - dimensional surface @xmath221 such that the vector @xmath222 , normal to the surface of spherical symmetry is null on @xmath221 . in our case",
    "it means that @xmath222 is null with respect to the acoustic metric .",
    "more explicitly , the acoustic metric magnitude of the vector @xmath223 should be zero on @xmath221 , i.e. , @xmath224 from this one finds the condition for the apparent horizon @xmath225 where @xmath226 .",
    "any solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq117 ] ) gives the location of the analog apparent horizon @xmath227 .",
    "finally , we define the _ naive horizon _ as a two - dimensional surface on which the radial velocity @xmath228 equals the velocity of sound @xmath16 . in the case of a stationary spherically symmetric",
    "flow , the apparent and naive horizons coincide with the analog event horizon @xcite .    as a simple example",
    ", we consider the analog de sitter spacetime with positive or negative spatial curvature .",
    "we have shown in section [ spacetimes ] how to mimic the @xmath9 and @xmath10 representations of the ds spacetime : the fluid described by the lagrangian ( [ eq3113 ] ) with the potential ( [ eq2008 ] ) should be forced to expand according to ( [ eq013])([eq014 ] ) where @xmath17 determines whether the analog spacetime has a positive or negative curvature . in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we plot the spacetime diagrams in conformal coordinates @xmath229 for the analog ds universe with positive and negative spatial curvature , respectively .",
    "the diagrams depict the evolution of the apparent ( full line ) , analog ( dashed line ) , and naive hubble ( dash - dotted line ) horizons .",
    "the shaded area in both figures represents the region of supersonic flow , i.e. , the region in which the fluid three - velocity @xmath230 exceeds the speed of sound @xmath16 . the diagonal line @xmath231 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] corresponds to the future infinity , i.e. , the point @xmath232 in minkowski coordinates .",
    "we have demonstrated that it is possible , at least in principle , to model an frw spacetime with arbitrary spatial curvature using a relativistic fluid and the associated effective acoustic geometry . to obtain the desired geometry one needs to manipulate the fluid equation of state in addition to an appropriately designed fluid expansion .",
    "we have shown in section [ bose ] that an open frw spacetime with zero or negative spatial curvature can be modeled using isentropic perfect fluids such as a bose - einstein condensate in the thomas - fermi limit .",
    "the modeling of a closed frw spacetime with positive spatial curvature is possible if the condition of isentropy is relaxed .",
    "this is achieved by a lagrangian with a quadratic kinetic energy term multiplied by a potential @xmath233 the choice of which determines the evolution of the analog cosmological scale .",
    "the acoustic analog metric takes the conformal form of a general frw spacetime with positive , negative , or zero spatial curvature depending on the choice of the sign parameter @xmath17 in the expression ( [ eq013])([eq014 ] ) for the flow velocity .",
    "it is conceivable that the analysis presented here is of considerable theoretical interest for emergent gravity models , in particular for those in which the emergent gravity is based on fluid flow ( for a comprehensive review and extensive list of references , see ref .",
    "it is worth mentioning a few examples in which there is an obvious connection to our analysis .",
    "the first one concerns already mentioned emergence of scalar gravity . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the framework of the fluid - field correspondence one can go beyond analog gravity by introducing a scalar field lagrangian that describes the dynamics of a scalar field as an interaction of the field and its associated effective metric given by ( [ eq3008 ] ) .",
    "this interaction may be interpreted as a gravitational influence on the field by its own effective metric @xcite .",
    "another example is the model of janik and peschanski @xcite in which perfect fluid hydrodynamics emerges as a consequence of the ads / cft correspondence . in their approach",
    "the ads / cft correspondence relates a perfect conformal fluid on the boundary to an asymptotically ads@xmath234 bulk .",
    "the link to our study is twofold : first , the fluid described by the lagrangian ( [ eq3113 ] ) is conformal and second , the longitudinal bjorken expansion of ref .",
    "@xcite is of the same form as our spherical expansion ( [ eq017 ] ) and ( [ eq018 ] ) obtained from the more general expression in the limit when the parameter @xmath235 approaches zero . assuming a true ads / cft duality , the boundary conformal fluid in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite may also be regarded as primary and the bulk as emergent @xcite .    in our study",
    "so far we have discussed simple toy models with no realistic fluid in mind . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only realistic experimental set up for a relativistic - fluid laboratory is provided by high - energy colliders . in our previous papers",
    "@xcite we suggested a relativistic collision model based on a spherical bjorken - type expansion to mimic an open frw universe . to model a closed universe ,",
    "a different type of expansion is needed with the @xmath9 velocity field ( [ eq013])([eq014 ] ) .",
    "presently we do not have a concrete proposal for how to do this in high - energy collisions .",
    "maybe , with the advance of accelerator technology , one day it will be possible , e.g. , by choosing appropriate heavy ions and specially designed beam geometry to obtain the desired equation of state and expansion flow of the fluid . to confront the model with experiment and test the properties of the analog spacetime it would be of interest to investigate the effects of the cosmological particle production in our relativistic model in the same way as it was done in the nonrelativistic analog models of expanding universes @xcite .",
    "besides , the presence of a trapped region and the apparent horizon can , in principle , be detected by looking for a signal of the analog hawking radiation in the particle distribution spectra",
