    "one could ask why the sequence @xmath44 is constructed by pulling the disks apart , rather than joining them by a tiny passage disappearing as @xmath68 . while this looks geometrically more natural , it turns out that the behavior of the steklov spectrum under such degeneration can be quite unexpected .    as before , set @xmath10 .
