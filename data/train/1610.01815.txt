    "in this supplementary material we present a brief introduction to the dmrg algorithms introduced by white  @xcite .",
    "later we contrast the standard dmrg with our two modified dmrg algorithms .",
    "the basic idea behind the dmrg approach is the singular - value decomposition ( svd ) of the ground - state .",
    "consider a quantum system partitioned into @xmath14 and @xmath15 subsystems with hilbert spaces of dimensions @xmath21 and @xmath182 , respectively .",
    "the ground - state wave - function is a @xmath183 dimensional vector which can be reshaped into a @xmath184 dimensional matrix , @xmath185 , where @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "the single value decomposing states that @xmath78 can be rewritten as @xmath188 , where @xmath189  ( @xmath190 ) is a unitary matrix formed of juxtaposing the eigenstates of @xmath191  ( @xmath192 ) , and @xmath193 is a diagonal matrix formed of eigenvalues of @xmath194 or @xmath195 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath194 and @xmath195 are indeed the rdms associated with the left and right subsystems respectively .",
    "similarly , the ee associated with the chosen partitioning is @xmath196 . for local gapped hamiltonians , the svd ( a.k.a .",
    "schmidt decomposition ) of the ground - state is much less complex than a generic excited state , namely most of the diagonal elements of the eigenvalue matrix @xmath193 are negligible leading to a lower ee for the ground - state .",
    "this allows us to use an efficient principal component analysis by keeping eigenvalues larger than a threshold , @xmath197 .",
    "let us assume the number of eigenvalues satisfying this condition is @xmath60 .",
    "accordingly , instead of @xmath189  ( @xmath190 ) we must use @xmath148  ( @xmath198 ) which contains the @xmath60 dominant eigenvectors of @xmath194  @xmath199 .",
    "we also have @xmath172 and a similar relation for @xmath198 .",
    "so , @xmath148   ( @xmath198 ) is a projection ( truncation ) operators that can project ground - state and operators defined in the @xmath14  ( @xmath15 ) subsystem to the subspace spanned by important eigenstates of the density matrices .",
    "for example , we expect @xmath200 to contain almost all of the information stored in @xmath78 e.g. , we can use it to find the correlation function , entanglement , ground - state energy and etc",
    ". therefore , the error of calculating these quantities w.r.t .",
    "@xmath201 decays exponential by increasing @xmath60 .    in practice , since we do not know the wavefunction a priori and thus we can not find the truncation matrices , we need to find an efficient way of achieving them .",
    "dmrg provides one way of reaching this goal , though in most 2 + 1d systems the bond dimension , @xmath60 , has an exponential dependence on the system width ( due to the area law ee in real space ) , hence we can only simulate narrow systems .",
    "the dmrg algorithm finds @xmath148 and @xmath198 by iteration . instead of considering the whole system of @xmath61 sites ( where the dimension of local ( onsite ) hilbert space is @xmath202 ) , in the @xmath203 step of iteration , dmrg partitions the system into three subregions , left , middle and right with @xmath147 , @xmath204 and @xmath147 sites respectively .",
    "then it assumes region @xmath205 is decoupled from the rest and also @xmath14 and @xmath15 regions interact with each other directly as if they are neighbors and attached ( obviously these assumptions generate some errors and dmrg needs to fix them in later steps ) . for small @xmath147",
    "we can use ed to find the ground - state(s ) exactly and no truncation is needed .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 regions can in general be written as : h_lr = h_l(n ) _ r + _ lh_r ( n)+ _ i g_i o_l^i(n)o_r^i(n ) , where @xmath206 are coupling constants .",
    "the soon as the hilbert space dimensions of the @xmath14 or @xmath15 regions exceed @xmath60 , we start truncating operators by @xmath207 and @xmath208 obtained as described above , after which we obtain :    = ( n ) + ( n ) + _ i g_i ^i(n)^i(n ) , where @xmath209 , and a similar expression for @xmath210 .",
    "the truncated operators are @xmath211 dimensional . in step",
    "@xmath212 , dmrg adds one site to the left and one site to the right , after which the dimension of the left ( and also right ) region is @xmath213 .",
    "again , we construct the total hamiltonian , find its ground - state and obtain the truncation matrices for step @xmath212 , @xmath214 and @xmath215",
    ". then we use the truncation matrices to truncate the operators once more after which their dimensions reduce to @xmath211 again .",
    "this way , the dimension of operators is kept constant instead of growing exponentially with @xmath147 .",
    "this procedure of adding sites followed by truncations is repeated until @xmath216 .",
    "so far , we assumed that only @xmath217 sites in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 regions interact , and therefore @xmath218 which except for gapped @xmath219 systems is not a good approximation . in order to improve this assumption",
    ", dmrg uses the so - called sweeps , where region @xmath205 disappears and in step @xmath147 , the left region contains @xmath147 sites and the right region contains the remaining @xmath220 sits . the truncation matrices and operator representations for @xmath221 and @xmath222 from previous iterations are used .",
    "then we construct the total hamiltonian , find the ground - state and use them to update @xmath207 , and @xmath223 as well as operators @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "after a few sweeps across the system , the algorithm converges and the ground - state energy , correlation functions and etc . can be obtained with a high accuracy for large enough values of @xmath60 .",
    "one criterion is that @xmath60 must be the order of @xmath226 at least , where @xmath227 is the ee associated with @xmath147 sites in the left .",
    "our first modified dmrg algorithm for finding @xmath228 degenerate ground - states considers the following modifications .",
    "( a ) in step @xmath147 , instead of finding the ground - state only , we find the lowest @xmath228 eigenstates ( e.g. , through the lanczos method ) . in order to accelerate the lanczos method",
    ", we can use the wave - function transformation explained in refs .",
    "we then find the rdm associated with each of them , and combine them with a proper choice of weights ( we usually consider uniform weight ) to obtain the effective density matrix .",
    "next , we use this effective density matrix to construct the truncation matrices instead of the rdm associated with the ground - state .",
    "( b ) instead of adding one site to the left , and one site to the right in the infinite dmrg ( when @xmath229 ) , we add @xmath230 ( @xmath231 ) to the left ( right ) region for odd @xmath147 and @xmath231 ( @xmath230 ) sites for even @xmath147 , depending on the problem ( we try to keep @xmath230 and @xmath231 as close as possible ) , to make sure that ( even theoretically ) the gsd remains @xmath228 in every step .",
    "for example , for @xmath232 fractional quantum hall states with toroidal geometry , we consider @xmath233 or @xmath234 . for @xmath235 , we chose @xmath236 and @xmath237 . whenever @xmath238 , we need to add some noise to the density matrix as described in ref .",
    "@xcite to improve the convergence and avoid metastable states . in finite dmrg steps ( during sweeps ) , we consider the standard choice of @xmath239 , since the total system size and thus gsd is fixed .    in our second modified dmrg algorithm",
    ", we construct two truncation matrices for each subregion .",
    "the first denoted as @xmath240 is obtained through the standard dmrg procedure using the @xmath241 dominant eigenvector of the rdm associated with the ground - state wave function .",

    "<S> the standard approach in most quantum simulation algorithms targets a single energy eigenstate , usually a gs ( among possibly several ones ) , e.g. , through constructing the projection ( truncation ) matrices using the rdm associated with that particular gs . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the standard approach is non - ergodic and as a result the information about other potentially degenerate gss or excited states is partially or completely lost . </S>",
    "<S> this is the main reason why standard dmrg can not necessarily obtain all degenerate gss . </S>",

    "<S> the resulting path integral is defined on a manifold which is formed of two cylinders on the right subsystem and a single two - sheeted riemann surfaces which is identical to a single cylinder whose radius is twice larger than cylinders on the right side . </S>",

    "<S> recall that in cft the excitation energy is proportional to @xmath83 . </S>",

[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example we find @xmath88 for the @xmath6 parafermion chain which is extremely close to the conformal dimension of the thermal operator @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the finite size effect is weaker in this computation compared with other methods such as using the correlation functions .    </S>",
    "<S> finding an analytic expression for @xmath90 is more challenging . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we use dmrg to study the behavior of this quantity in the 1 + 1d gapless states of free fermions and @xmath6 parafermion chain . </S>",
    "<S> ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> it is worth mentioning that away from the critical point , the entanglement distance vanishes for degenerate gss of @xmath93 parafermion chains in the thermodynamics limit . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood through the following argument for the @xmath94 parafermion chain ( kitaev s 1d model ) at @xmath95 limit which can be trivially generalized to other @xmath93 models . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> the two - fold degenerate gss are : @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) which have well - defined fermion parity @xmath98 . since for both states @xmath99 the entanglement distance is zero .     the same plot as fig . </S>",

    "<S> non - interacting fermions. _ * the entanglement properties of free fermions can be easily computed using the single particle correlation matrix @xmath104  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> it can be shown that @xmath108 . </S>",

    "<S> it can be numerically verified that for many - body states the two definitions of @xmath118 behave similarly .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1 ] shows that for gapless fermions in 1d , the entanglement distance between @xmath119 and @xmath120 increases quadratically with the excitation energy up to some energy index threshold equal to @xmath48 and then starts oscillating around the saturation point with a wavelength again equal to @xmath48 . </S>",

    "<S> [ eps4 ] hence , degenerate gss have maximum distance from each other and using one of the gss only for the truncation matrix causes a severe loss of information . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the next section we show that there is simple resolution of this issue at the cost of a linear increase of computation time . </S>",

    "<S> we want to find the optimal truncation matrix @xmath148 with dimension @xmath149 that contains information about all @xmath147 states . </S>",
    "<S> the truncation error associated with the @xmath16-th reduced matrix is @xmath150 . </S>",
    "<S> let us weight each truncation error by @xmath151 which may depend on the energy of state @xmath16 e.g. , @xmath152 or its entanglement or both . for topological states </S>",
    "<S> a reasonable choice can be @xmath153 . </S>",
    "<S> the total weighted cost function becomes : @xmath154 which can be rewritten as : @xmath155 , where @xmath156 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the optimal choice for @xmath148 minimizes the truncation error of @xmath157 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at each step of dmrg or related methods , we need to find @xmath147 lowest energy eigenstates and combine them properly to build the effective rdm and use it to achieve @xmath148 for truncation . fulfilling this requirement , </S>",
    "<S> we are guaranteed to find all gss in later steps . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , even for fairly large values of bond dimension @xmath158 , the information about @xmath159 states will leak out in a rate depending on the entanglement distance and there is no guarantee that the standard dmrg can recover all degenerate states in the later steps . </S>",
    "<S> now we need to find an estimate for the value of the effective bond dimension @xmath158 . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively we expect @xmath160 . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement distance that we computed previously helps us to estimate this value . </S>",
    "<S> since the gs of the system ( with trivial charge for topological states ) has the lowest ee among all nearby states , the ee associated with @xmath157 is necessarily larger that that of the gs with trivial charge . for 1 + 1d systems , </S>",
    "<S> since the entanglement distance varies linearly as a function of energy separations and thus vanishes for degenerate states , @xmath161 as @xmath162 has almost the same ee as the trivial gs . </S>",
    "<S> however , for 2 + 1 d topological states , the situation is quite different . using eq . </S>",
    "<S> we can find @xmath163 as : s_2^eff = s_2(_eff ) = - n_b - ( _ a ) [ seff ] which is consistent with the result found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath164 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in this expression for @xmath158 we must include _ deconfined anyons _ only . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5]a shows how this modified dmrg achieves the correct gsd for laughlin states  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the second algorithm combines ideas from white s dmrg and wilson s numerical rg ( nrg ) methods  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , nrg does not explicitly break ergodicity since truncation matrices are obtained from sub - system hamiltonian instead of rdms . </S>",
    "<S> however , except for certain systems it usually provides an unsatisfactory estimate of the gs energy . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the white s dmrg estimates energy very well but can not keep track of all degenerate states . </S>",
    "<S> now let us consider @xmath165 with dimension @xmath166 obtained from the rdm in the usual way , and @xmath167 with dimension @xmath168 that is obtained by putting lowest @xmath169 eigenstates of left hamiltonian @xmath170 together . </S>",
    "<S> the truncation matrix is obtained via the concatenation of these two truncation matrices , @xmath171 $ ] , followed by orthogonalization of the two sub - matrices to enforce @xmath172 constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the computation cost of this is same as that of dmrg with @xmath173 . </S>",
    "<S> this method can obtain all degenerate states of 1 + 1d systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , consider @xmath6 parafermion chain with @xmath174 domain walls and @xmath175 and @xmath176 whose @xmath177 . the gs energy for these parameters can be obtained using the standard dmrg with @xmath178 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we just obtain one gs even if we consider @xmath179  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , with our second modified dmrg , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 are sufficient to obtain all degenerate states . </S>",
