    "a dramatic gamma - ray outburst of bl lacertae ( z=0.069 ) during july 1997 was recently reported by @xcite .",
    "bl lac s gamma - ray activity was coincident with bright and variable emission from optical to x - rays ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; however , the light curves in each waveband are too sparsely sampled to determine accurately whether they are correlated .",
    "in addition , the gamma - ray spectrum was significantly harder than in the lower intensity state , which is commonly seen for flaring blazars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "multiwavelength flares coincident with gamma - ray flares have also been documented for many other objects ( eg . , 3c 279 , @xcite ; and 1406 - 076 , @xcite ) .",
    "the observations during the flare will be discussed further in section 2 .",
    "historically , bl lacertae was the prototypical ` bl lac object ' , i.e. , has quasar - like continuum properties , but does usually not show emission or absorption lines ( the equivalent width is @xmath1  ) .",
    "though , h@xmath2 emission lines have been detected in bl lac itself during a period of several weeks in 1995 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "bl lacertae is also a member of the blazar class of objects , i.e. a radio - loud agn which has bright and variable broadband continuum emission as well as relatively high polarization .",
    "about 50 blazars have been detected in high energy gamma - rays by the egret instrument , and 14 are bl  lac objects ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we will examine the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution ( sed ; or plot of @xmath3 ) of bl lac considering several emission mechanisms as the possible source of gamma - rays : synchrotron self - compton scattering ( ssc ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , external inverse compton scattering with an accretion disk as the source of soft photons ( ecd ; @xcite ) , and an external inverse compton scattering of soft photons reprocessed in broad line region clouds ( ecc ; @xcite ) .",
    "these mechanisms and the techniques used will be discussed further in section 3 .",
    "the modeling results and their implications for the nuclear environment of bl  lac are presented and discussed in section 4 .",
    "a discussion of the application of alternative  leptonic as well as hadronic  models to the broadband spectrum on bl  lacertae follows in section 5 .",
    "we summarize in section 6 . in the appendix",
    ", we discuss our numerical treatment of compton scattering of reprocessed accretion disk radiation , which was not included in the original version of the jet simulation code used for our modeling procedure .",
    "in addition to the optical ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 band ) and egret gamma - ray observations of bloom _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) , we have included additional optical ( @xmath6 ; @xcite ) , radio , x - ray , and low energy gamma - ray observations from the time of the outburst .",
    "the radio observations at 2.25 and 8.3 ghz are from the green bank interferometer monitoring program ( @xcite ) , the 4 , 8 and 14  ghz measurements are from the umrao monitoring program ( @xcite ) . the 2 - 10 kev asca x - ray spectrum ( @xcite ) shown in figs . 1  3 ( thick dashed curves ) are from continuous measurements of july 18.6  19.62 and yielded a photon spectral index of @xmath7 .",
    "the asca spectrum agrees well with the xte pca spectrum of madejski et al .",
    "( 1997a ) from the same epoch , which is not plotted in the figures .",
    "madejski et al . ( 1999 ) show that the x - ray spectrum is harder than for earlier epochs , and that it is variable on time scales of approximately one day .",
    "the osse observations from 0.15  1.0 mev have been provided by the osse team ( @xcite ) .",
    "tev upper limits from cat ( @xcite ) and hegra ( @xcite ) from observations in 1997 august are also added ( filled square and circle , respectively ) .",
    "although these measurements are not quite simultaneous to the remainder of the observations , they might give a rough estimate of the actual tev flux at the time of the july 1997 outburst because the optical flux during the tev observations was similar to the flux observed during the egret flare .    a reddening correction of @xmath8 derived from @xmath9 from vermeulen _ et al . _",

    "13 are averages during the week of the gamma - ray flare .",
    "the optical flux exhibited short - term variability on a timescale of several hours .",
    "the error bars shown in the figures correspond to the dispersion of the optical fluxes during the observing period .",
    "we modelled the broadband spectrum of bl  lac with the pair plasma jet simulation code described in detail in bttcher _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 , hereafter bms ) . in this section",
    ", we only give a short outline of the model and the assumptions .",
    "our model is based on various versions of leptonic jet models for blazar emission . a blob of ultrarelativistic pair plasma is moving outward from the central accretion disc along a pre - existing cylindrical jet structure , with relativistic speed @xmath11 and bulk lorentz factor @xmath12 . in the following ,",
    "primed quantities refer to the rest frame comoving with the relativistic plasma blob . at the time of injection into the jet at height @xmath13 above the accretion disc ,",
    "the pair plasma is assumed to have an isotropic momentum distribution in the comoving frame .",
    "the distribution functions at this time are power - laws , @xmath14 , with low- and high - energy cut - offs @xmath15 .",
    "the total density of electrons ( and positrons ) in the comoving frame is @xmath16 .",
    "the blob is spherical in the comoving frame with radius @xmath17 which does not change along the jet . a randomly oriented magnetic field of strength @xmath18 is present , where @xmath19 is the magnetic field corresponding to equipartition with the energy density of pairs at the base of the jet .",
    "the jet is inclined at an angle @xmath20 with respect to the line of sight . the spherical geometry in the comoving rest frame implies that , in the stationary frame of the agn , the blob appears lorentz contracted with a length parallel to the jet axis of @xmath21 and a perpendicular extent @xmath22 .",
    "as the blob moves out , various radiation and cooling mechanisms are at work : synchrotron radiation , synchrotron self - compton radiation ( ssc ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , inverse - compton scattering of external radiation from the accretion disc , either entering the jet directly ( ecd for external compton scattering of direct disc radiation ; @xcite , @xcite ) or after being rescattered by surrounding ( blr ) material ( ecc for external compton scattering of radiation from clouds ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the latter process was not included in the original version of the bms simulation code .",
    "therefore , its treatment is described in more detail in the appendix .",
    "the blr is represented by a spherical layer of material with uniform density and total thomson depth @xmath23 , extending between the radii @xmath24 from the central black hole .",
    "the synchrotron mirror mechanism ( @xcite , @xcite ) is unlikely to be efficient in bl  lac objects ( @xcite ) , because it requires a high thomson depth of the surrounding material ( @xmath25 ) , for which no evidence exists in this class of objects .",
    "therefore we do not consider it in our spectral modeling procedure for bl  lac .",
    "the central accretion disc is radiating a standard shakura - syunyaev ( 1973 ) disc spectrum around a black hole of @xmath26 solar masses .",
    "the total disc luminosity is @xmath27  erg  s@xmath28 .",
    "the full angle dependence of the disc radiation field , according to its radial temperature structure , is taken into account .",
    "compton scattering of all radiation fields is calculated using the full klein - nishina cross section .",
    "the ssc mechanism is calculated to arbitrarily high scattering order .",
    "after the initial injection of ultrarelativistic pairs , all of the mechanisms mentioned above ( except the synchrotron mirror ) are taken into account in order to follow the evolution of the electron / positron distribution functions and the time - dependent broadband emission as the blob moves out along the jet .",
    "@xmath29 absorption intrinsic to the source and the re - injection of pairs due to @xmath29 pair production is taken into account completely self - consistently using the exact , analytic solution of bttcher & schlickeiser ( 1997 ) for the pair injection spectrum due to @xmath29 absorption . however , with the parameters adopted to fit the spectrum of bl  lac , the blob is optically thin to @xmath29 absorption for photons up to at least 100  gev so that this process plays a minor role .",
    "consequently , since we assume that the blob does not expand , the total electron ( positron ) density @xmath16 in the blob remains basically constant along the jet .",
    "the broadband spectrum investigated in this paper is a time average over the entire duration of the @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "thus , it corresponds to the time average of the radiation emitted by one or multiple plasma blobs rather than to a snapshot during the evolution of a single blob . to compare our model spectra to the observed broadband spectrum of bl  lacertae",
    ", we use the time - integrated broadband emission ( fluence ) of a single blob .",
    "an average flux is calculated by dividing the fluence by a representative time scale which corresponds to the time scale of repeated blob ejection events",
    ". a jet quasi - continuously filled with relativistic pair plasma corresponds to a repetition time of @xmath30 .",
    "we define a filling factor @xmath31 of the jet given by @xmath32 . in all our model",
    "fits we find that the repetition time scale ( in the comoving frame ) is generally longer than the cooling time scale for the highest - energy electrons , but comparable to the decay time scale of radiation produced by the inefficiently cooled part of the electron spectrum .",
    "therefore , the variability in the high - energy portions of both the synchrotron and the inverse - compton components ( optical  uv and @xmath33  mev @xmath0-rays , respectively ) is dominated by light - travel time effects within the source .",
    "these effects have recently been studied in detail by chiaberge & ghisellini ( 1998 ) .",
    "strong variability on the light - travel time scale through the blob is expected in the high - energy parts of both radiation components , if the filling factor is substantially less than 1 .",
    "the variability in these two energy bands ( optical / uv and high - energy @xmath0-rays ) is expected to be correlated . if @xmath34 , any variability pattern is determined by variations of the electron injection parameters ( i. e. the electron density , cutoff energies , spectral index etc . ) and its modelling would require additional model assumptions about the underlying accretion flow and the pair injection mechanism .",
    "the low - frequency portions of both components ( radio  infrared and x - rays , respectively ) , which are predominantly produced by basically uncooled electrons , are expected to show relatively weak variability on longer time scales , also determined by long - term variations of the pair injection parameters .",
    "we point out that the evolution of individual blobs is virtually independent of the existence of multiple blobs along the jet if there are no significant fluctuations of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath12 within the flow .",
    "the radiation emitted by each individual blob is quasi - isotropic in the comoving frame so that the radiative interaction between different blobs may be neglected .",
    "the situation investigated here is geometrically very similar to shocks propagating along the jet because for large values of @xmath12 the blobs are strongly lorentz contracted along the jet axis .",
    "a major difference between a shock - in - jet model and our impulsive - acceleration model is that in the case of shocks particle acceleration will continue to take place at large distances from the central engine , where the external radiation field due to direct or reprocessed accretion disk radiation is negligible .",
    "therefore , those models will be strongly ssc dominated . the spectral signatures will be basically indistinguishable from the ssc dominated cases of our model calculations , which we will discuss in the following section .    throughout this paper , we assume @xmath35  km  s@xmath28  mpc@xmath28 and @xmath36 .",
    "apart from the observed broadband spectrum , there are several other observational results on bl  lac , which constrain the choice of parameters to be adopted in our modeling efforts .",
    "recently , denn et al . ( 1999 ) have observed superluminal motion in bl  lac of single components with up to @xmath37 .",
    "this indicates that the typical bulk lorentz factor is expected to be in the range @xmath38 .",
    "this is much higher than the limit implied by the required transperency of the emitting region for high - energy @xmath0-ray photons due to @xmath29 absorption within the source , which yields    @xmath39    for a variability time scale of 1 day .",
    "here @xmath40\\right)^{-1}$ ] is the doppler factor .",
    "occasionally , bl  lac shows strong emission lines . on may 21 and june 1 , 1995 ,",
    "their width has been measured to be @xmath41  km  s@xmath28 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if we attribute this width to keplerian motion , we find for the average distance of the blr clouds from the central black hole :    @xmath42    we have used the xstar code ( kallman & krolik 1998 ) in order to estimate the emission line luminosity resulting from a blr consisting of thomson thick ( @xmath43 ) individual clouds , illuminated by disk blackbody radiation from an accretion disc around a black hole of @xmath44 , radiating at a luminosity of @xmath45  erg  s@xmath28 .",
    "we find that an angle - average thomson depth @xmath46 is sufficient to produce the observed line luminosity @xmath47  erg  s@xmath28 .",
    "however , this value of the required @xmath48 is strongly dependent on the clumpiness of the blr and may well deviate by more than an order of magnitude from the value given above .",
    "the total luminosity of the accretion disc is poorly constrained since the spectral coverage is insufficient to clearly exclude the existence of a big blue bump from the accretion disc .",
    "we adopt a disc luminosity of @xmath49  erg  s@xmath28 , implying that no big blue bump should be observable above the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the shortest observed variability timescale during the 1997 flare was several hours , observed at optical wavelengths .",
    "the variability timescale at @xmath0-ray energies was @xmath50  day , while it was slightly shorter than a day in x - rays .",
    "the optical variability yields a constraint on the extent of the emission region of    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the variability timescale in units of 5  hours .",
    "we have first attempted to fit the broadband spectrum of bl  lac with the basic models , where one of the radiation mechanisms mentioned above dominates the entire x - ray and @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "madejski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have presented an analytical estimate of the required parameters for an ssc fit to bl  lacertae , indicating that , if the entire @xmath0-ray spectrum , peaking at @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the dimensionless photon energy , were produced by the ssc mechanism , unrealistic values of @xmath55 and @xmath56  g would be needed . as mentioned in the previous section , the same arguments would apply to an ssc dominated shock - in - jet model .",
    "[ ssc_fit ] illustrates our attempts to fit a strongly ssc - dominated model to the broadband spectrum of bl  lac .",
    "the optical flux and the hard x - ray and soft @xmath0-ray spectrum are well reproduced by this model .",
    "it is also very well consistent with the concave spectral shape at soft x - rays for which madejski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have found weak evidence in asca observations of bl  lacertae in 1995 november , suggesting that the high - energy tail of the synchrotron component and the low - energy tail of the inverse - compton component overlap in the 2  10  kev energy band . however , a pure ssc model is not able to reproduce the hard power - law above 100  mev ( egret ) .",
    "this is primarily because an ssc spectrum does not produce a strong spectral break in the mev range which would be necessary to connect the x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray spectrum to the egret spectrum .",
    "our model @xmath0-ray spectrum peaks at a values of @xmath57 significantly lower than @xmath58 , which is the only way to allow for more realistic values of @xmath12 and @xmath59 than estimated above .",
    "in contrast to the ssc model , a pure external inverse - compton model does produce the necessary spectral break in the mev energy range and therefore reproduces the osse ",
    "egret @xmath0-ray spectrum of bl  lac better ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . however , the spectrum predicted by the ecd - dominated model is inconsistent with the asca x - ray spectrum .",
    "the jet filling factor corresponding to the simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ ecd_fit ] is @xmath60 , which implies that any variability would be related to variations of the particle injection / acceleration mechanism . in order to have the ecd component",
    "strongly dominate the ssc component we need to assume a much larger mass of the central black hole ( @xmath61 ) than for our best fit presented in fig .",
    "[ combined_fit ] , where @xmath62 .",
    "the parameters required for an synchrotron + ecd model to reproduce the observed luminosities and peak frequencies in the broadband spectrum of bl  lacertae can be estimated using    @xmath63    where @xmath13 is the injection height of the plasma blob above the accretion disk , which is approximated by a point source located at the center of the agn . using    @xmath64    where @xmath65  g , we find that eq .",
    "[ l_ecd ] becomes independent of @xmath12 , and    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the dimensionless peak energy of the accretion disk spectrum .",
    "since in the ecc process the accretion disc photon energies are boosted to much higher energies into the blob rest frame , because most of the soft photons enter the blob from the front , it is not possible to produce the osse  egret spectrum of bl  lac with a single ecc radiation component .",
    "however , it is appropriate to produce the observed @xmath0 radiation in the egret energy range and , in particular , the spectral peak at @xmath68 with reasonable parameters . approximating the external photon energy density due to reprocessed accretion disk photons as    @xmath69",
    "we find @xmath70 or @xmath71 in reasonable agreement with our estimates on @xmath72 and @xmath48 as given at the beginning of this section , considering the uncertainty of those estimates due to the unknown degree of clumpiness of the blr .",
    "the co - moving magnetic field may be estimated as    @xmath73    the problems with fitting a one - component x - ray / @xmath0-ray spectrum to the sed of bl  lac lead us to the conclusion that a second component is necessary to explain its peculiar high - energy spectrum .",
    "this is in agreement with the general tendency among different subclasses of blazars found by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that the sequence hbl @xmath74 lbl @xmath74 fsrq may be related to an increasing dominance of external compton scattering over synchrotron self - compton scattering in the @xmath0-ray regime .",
    "since the properties of bl  lacertae are found to be intermediate between classical bl  lac objects and quasars , such a combination of ssc and erc mechanisms appears to be a natural explanation for its peculiar high - energy spectrum .",
    "for the case of bl  lacertae this conclusion was first pointed out on the basis of analytical estimates by madejski _",
    "( 1997b , 1999 ) .",
    "since the ssc mechanism yields a reasonable fit to the optical to soft @xmath0-ray spectrum , we started out from this model and adjusted the parameters in a way that a second component shows up in the egret energy range .",
    "the fact that there is clear evidence for the existence of blr clouds rather close to the central black hole , and the analytical estimates regarding this process suggest that the ecc mechanism is responsible for this additional high - energy component .",
    "[ combined_fit ] shows our best fit to the sed of bl  lac .",
    "the broadband spectrum from optical to high - energy @xmath0-rays is reasonably well reproduced by our model . however , as all of our model calculations , it underpredicts the radio flux , because the low - energy cutoff in the electron energy distribution leads to a sharp cutoff in the synchrotron spectrum below @xmath75  hz .",
    "since there is no clear evidence for a correlation between radio and @xmath0-ray flares in blazars ( @xcite ) , it seems plausible that most of the radio flux is produced in the outer jet regions , where the bulk kinetic energy of the jet is dissipated in interactions with external material .",
    "this is supported by the results of long - term radio , ir , optical , and x - ray monitoring of bl  lacertae as reported by bregman et al .",
    "they have found that radio flux variations typically lack fluctuations at optical and ir frequencies by @xmath50 - 4  years .",
    "their result that radio and ir flux variations are correlated with x - ray variations , but not with fluctuations of the optical flux , is consistent with the ir and the x - ray flux being produced by strongly cooled electrons in the jet via synchrotron and ssc radiation , respectively .",
    "the radio , ir , and x - ray portions of the photon spectrum reflect long - term variations of the physical conditions at the acceleration site .",
    "short - term variations of the injected electron spectrum are smoothed out by the slow cooling process .",
    "in contrast , the optical flux , produced by electrons cooling on much shorter time scales , reflects variations of the physical conditions on time scales comparable to the synchrotron cooling time scale of ultrarelativistic electrons . using similar arguments , mchardy et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have recently interpreted simultaneous ir and x - ray fluctuations of 3c  273 as evidence for the ssc process being responsible for the x - ray emission of that object .",
    "the fact that in figs .",
    "[ ssc_fit ] and [ combined_fit ] the total spectrum ( solid line ) is below the ( unabsorbed ) ssc spectrum ( long dashed ) , indicates that here @xmath29 absorption becomes important . as outlined above , @xmath29 pair production is included in our simulations self - consistently .",
    "the blob repetition time required by our fit implies a filling factor of @xmath76 , which means that the jet is filled essentially continuously . as explained in the previous section",
    ", this implies that due to light - travel time effects within the blob no strong variability on time scales shorter than the light - travel time through the blob are expected ( @xcite ) , although the cooling timescale of ultrarelativistic electrons in the blob rest frame is only a few @xmath77  s. source variability is directly related to variations of the injection / acceleration mechanism .    due to the very time - consuming nature of our simulations",
    ", we can not perform a detailed variational analysis of all parameters and give relative errors on their values .",
    "however , we point out that the relative strength of the different radiation components as well as their location in energy space constrain most of the parameters listed in the figure captions rather tightly . for example",
    ", an increase in the black hole mass leads to a ) the blr moving outward ( eq . [ 1 ] ) and thus to a decrease of the ecc component , and b ) the schwarzschild radius and therefore the disc moving outward and becoming cooler , implying that the ecd component becomes stronger ( because photons enter the blob under a more favorable angle ) , but emerges at different energies ( combined effect of different disc temperature and different beaming pattern of disc radiation into the blob ) . due to the colder disk , the ecc component will emerge at lower energies .",
    "such changes also imply a change in the cooling time scale as compared to the required repetition time scale , determined by the total luminosity of a single blob which has consequences on the predicted variability pattern as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "this may indicate that the self - consistent system we simulate is rather sensitive to changes of the parameters , although there might still be ambiguities .",
    "our results are sensitive to the assumed injection height @xmath13 of the blob . according to the physical picture that the blob is produced by an explosive event in a hot corona above the accretion disk , we have generally chosen @xmath78 , since there is no obvious mechanism how relativistic particles could be transported to significant distances above the disk without radiative losses .",
    "we find the appropriate average thomson depth of the blr , @xmath79 , to be comparable to what we expect in other bl  lac objects ( using the estimates given in @xcite ) .",
    "however , since the blr seems to be located unusually close to the accretion disc ( @xmath80 ) , it can still produce a significant flux in h@xmath2 line emission and contribute a significant soft photon density from rescattered accretion disc radiation .",
    "as pointed out in bttcher & dermer ( 1998 ) , a blr of such low thomson depth , located so close to the central black hole is extremely inefficient in terms of the synchrotron mirror mechanism , which provides additional justification for our neglect of this process .    according to the results of stecker & de jager ( 1997 ) ,",
    "@xmath29 absorption by the intergalactic infrared background radiation is negligible for these photon energies at the redshift of bl  lac ( z = 0.069 ) , so the cutoff has to be intrinsic to the source .",
    "however , the cat and hegra measurements have been performed in august 1997 and were therefore not simultaneous to the rest of the broadband spectrum .",
    "since generally blazars show the strongest and most rapid variability at the highest photon energies , the @xmath81  gev flux during the egret outburst could well have been higher than indicated by the upper limits in figs .",
    "[ ssc_fit ]  [ combined_fit ] .",
    "our model has generally problems with the hard optical spectrum .",
    "although the correct optical flux is predicted , rapid cooling leads to a steep optical synchrotron spectrum @xmath82 for a cooling particle population injected with a power - law @xmath83 .",
    "the same problem has been encountered in other blazars , such as pks  0528 + 134 ( @xcite ) where , in some observing periods , the optical spectrum indicates an upturn compared to the overall synchrotron spectrum .",
    "this upturn is clearly inconsistent with the onset of the inverse - compton component as well as with a `` big blue bump '' due to direct accretion disk radiation , which , in the case of pks  0528 + 134 , would imply an accretion disk luminosity of @xmath84  erg  s@xmath28 .",
    "up to now there is no generally accepted solution to this problem , and in most modeling efforts on the objects , it is simply ignored",
    ". a possible solution might be the effect of reacceleration , e. g. by hydromagnetic turbulences due to interactions of the jet material with the surrounding medium .",
    "fermi acceleration by hydromagnetic turbulences will only affect the lowest - energy particles of the pair ensemble simulated here because for higher particle energies radiative losses strongly dominate reacceleration .",
    "since the optical regime is close to the low - frequency turnover of the synchrotron component , reacceleration will thus have its dominant effect in this spectral range .",
    "until now , we have focused on the homogeneous , leptonic jet model characterized by instantaneous injection events of relativistic plasma blobs into the jet .",
    "we are now discussing a variety of alternative models which have also met with considerable success in explaining broadband spectra of blazars . for models invoking continuous injection of electrons into the jet , such as the accelerating - jet model discussed by georganopoulos & marscher ( 1998 )",
    ", the final conclusions would be very similar to those found in the analysis of our model since our fits require jet filling factors close to unity .      in the previous section we had",
    "already briefly mentioned that a shock propagating through the jet ( e. g. , @xcite , @xcite ) would be strongly ssc dominated , and the broadband spectrum predicted by this model would be very similar to our ssc dominated case ( see fig .",
    "[ ssc_fit ] ) .",
    "however , the spectrum could look drastically different if an external radiation component becomes efficient at large distances from the central engine .",
    "this external radiation component could most plausibly be provided by a cloud , reflecting part of the synchrotron radiation produced within the jet ( the synchrotron mirror , @xcite ) .",
    "bttcher & dermer ( 1998 ) have shown that the energy density of the reflected synchrotron radiation in the comoving frame of the disturbance may be approximated as    @xmath85    where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the radial extent and the thomson depth of the reflecting cloud of cold material , and @xmath88 is the distance of the disturbance from the central engine . in this model , @xmath17 may be identified with the extent of the disturbance along the jet ( denoted @xmath89 in @xcite ) . approximating further @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the thomson depth of the disturbance along the jet axis , and @xmath92 , we find    @xmath93    eq . [ l_rsy ] indicates that the synchrotron mirror becomes efficient , if @xmath94 . in the following , we will require this condition to be fulfilled .",
    "the variability time scale of a high - energy @xmath0-ray flare in this scenario is given by @xmath95 , which yields a constraint on @xmath86 in addition to the constraint on @xmath17 as given in eq .",
    "[ rb ] . using these constraints , we find    @xmath96    which is appears to be a reasonable number .",
    "assuming that the hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray spectrum of bl  lacertae is dominated by the ssc process  as we expect in the shock - in - jet model  , and that the ssc component peaks at @xmath97 , we derive a bulk lorentz factor of @xmath98 .",
    "then , the condition @xmath99 yields @xmath100  pc . since the disturbance is emitting synchrotron and ssc radiation basically independent of the external ( reflected ) radiation field , we would expect an extended high state of    @xmath101    at mm , infrared , optical , uv , x - rays , and soft @xmath0-rays prior to the egret flare .",
    "this seems to contradict the observed quasi - simultaneous flaring at optical frequencies and in the egret energy range as reported by bloom et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , unless the synchrotron mirror operates at very low efficiency due to @xmath102 .",
    "blandford & levinson ( 1995 ) have proposed a model invoking a pair cascade developing along the jet as synchrotron and inverse - compton radiation produced by the accretion disk and within the jet is rescattered into the jet by circumnuclear material and initiates a pair cascade via @xmath29 pair production with the inverse - compton emission produced by relativistic electrons injected into the jet at the injection radius . in its original form , this model predicts single power - law high - energy spectra , but it is well conceivable that the soft and hard @xmath0-ray spectra are composed of different radiation components , as in our model .",
    "one problem with this pair cascade model is that it predicts that the high - energy emission in the egret regime lags variations at lower frequencies , and the high - energy variability should be characterized by longer variability time scales , which is in contradiction to most @xmath0-ray flares observed from blazars so far .",
    "this is because the @xmath0-ray photosphere , beyond which the jet becomes optically thin to @xmath29 pair production for photons of a given @xmath0-ray energy , increases with increasing photon energy .",
    "also , the observed quasi - simultaneity of the optical and @xmath0-ray flares of bl  lac with probably roughly equal time scales might be hard to reproduce with this model .",
    "a different model , also based on a leptonic pair cascade , has been suggested by marcowith et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in this model ,",
    "the jet consists of a mildly relativistic , cylindrical outer electron - proton jet which powers an ultrarelativistic , inner pair jet via hydromagnetic interaction at the boundary between these two regions .",
    "a pair cascade is initiated by @xmath29 absorption of inverse - compton scattered direct accretion disk photons with themselves and the radiation field of the accretion disk .",
    "the model predicts a strong spectral break ( @xmath103 ) at the photon energy where @xmath29 absorption becomes important . as in the blandford & levinson ( 1995 ) model",
    ", this scenario predicts a @xmath0-ray photosphere increasing with @xmath0-ray energy .",
    "the marcowith et al .",
    "( 1995 ) model has been very successful in explaining the high - energy spectrum of 3c  273 , where many other models have problems with the large spectral break around @xmath104  mev .",
    "however , in its published form , the model does not provide detailed predictions about the synchrotron component , and it predicts a smooth single power - law at high energies , inconsistent with the mev  gev spectrum of bl  lacertae . an additional soft photon source for inverse - compton scattering could possibly solve the latter problem , but these issues would need to be addressed in detail by the authors of this model , before a final conclusion about its applicability to bl  lacertae can be drawn .      in this subsection , we discuss models in which most of the relativistic particle energy in the jet is primarily contained in protons .",
    "their energy can either be transferred to secondary pairs through @xmath105 initiated pair cascades or via collisionless acceleration mechanisms to primary electrons .",
    "mannheim et al . ( 1996 ) have presented a model fit of the proton - initiated cascade ( pic ) model of mannheim ( 1993 ) to a non - simultaneous broadband spectrum of bl  lacertae .",
    "this model seems to have the potential to provide a reasonable fit also to our simultaneous broadband spectrum .",
    "the hardening of the @xmath0-ray spectrum at several gev may be interpreted as the blue - shifted bump resulting from the decay of first - generation @xmath106 mesons produced in @xmath107 interactions .",
    "flares at @xmath0-ray energies are expected to be simultaneous to synchrotron flares , in agreement with the observations of bl  lacertae . for model parameters derived in the context of this model",
    "see mannheim et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .    the second class of initially proton - dominated jet models is based on plasmoid deceleration and collisionless transfer of internal energy of swept - up protons to non - thermal electrons ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radiation signatures of these processes have been investigated in detail by dermer & chiang ( 1998 ) and chiang & dermer ( 1999 ) , and their application to blazars has been discussed in dermer ( 1999 ) and pohl & schlickeiser ( 1999 ) . for moderate ( @xmath108 ) bulk lorentz factors of the plasmoid ssc is so far assumed to be the primary @xmath0-ray production mechanism .",
    "the simultaneity between the synchrotron and the @xmath0-ray flare observed in bl  lacertae suggests that the radiative cooling time scale of non - thermal electrons in the blast wave is shorter than the dynamical time scale of the system , i. e. the electrons are in the fast - cooling regime . in this case , and if ssc scattering occurs in the thomson regime , the @xmath0-ray luminosity may be approximated as    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is the spectral index of the nonthermal distribution into which electrons are accelerated , and @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the energies in nonthermal electrons and in the magnetic field as a fraction of their respective equipartition values . for a standard value of @xmath113 , this yields @xmath114 , which implies that the magnetic field strength has to be substantially below the equipartition value .",
    "this has also been found for @xmath0-ray bursts by chiang & dermer ( 1999 ) , where too strong a magnetic field would lead to too rapid electron cooling , producing too soft x - ray spectra , inconsistent with the hard low - energy slopes observed by batse . a pure ssc spectrum",
    ", however , would not produce the peculiar spectral shape of the high - energy spectrum observed in bl  lac .",
    "a solution to this problem could be a blue - shifted @xmath106 bump ( @xcite ) or an additional contribution from comptonization of an external radiation field .",
    "we have analyzed the multiwavelength data for bl  lacertae during its july 1997 outburst in terms of several popular models for the broadband emission of blazars .",
    "we found that a reasonable fit is only possible with a combined ssc / ecc model .",
    "the parameters of the central accretion disc and its environment which yield an acceptable fit are @xmath115 , @xmath116  erg  s@xmath28 , @xmath79 .",
    "the minimum variability time scale consistent with our model is @xmath117  h.    the need for an external inverse - compton component in the gev photon energy range , in addition to the ssc component , confirms that bl  lac is an atypical bl  lac  object . for example , the simultaneous broadband spectra of the x - ray selected bl  lac  objects like mrk  421 ( @xcite ) and mrk  501 ( @xcite , @xcite ) can very well be fitted with a pure ssc model , while the emergence of an external inverse - compton component seems to be more typical of quasars , where strong line emission indicates the existence of relatively dense broad - line regions .",
    "in fact , most simultaneous broadband spectra of quasars during outbursts can well be fit with an ecc or ecd model ( e. g. , 3c273 : @xcite ) , or a combined ssc / ecd / ecc model ( e. g. , pks  0528 + 134 : @xcite , @xcite ; 3c279 : @xcite ) .",
    "this trend has been more firmly established by a detailed modeling analysis of 51 @xmath0-ray loud blazars by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "since bl  lac belongs to the subclass of radio selected bl  lac objects whose properties are generally intermediate between quasars and x - ray selected bl  lacs , our results might strengthen the hypothesis that it is the density and structure of matter surrounding the central engine of an agn which determines its appearance as either quasar or bl  lac object .",
    "in particular , this implies that the differences between these classes of objects are not predominantly due to viewing angle effects .",
    "our conclusions are certainly biased in the sense that we have concentrated on leptonic jet models of impulsive particle injection , which is the only type of models which we have supported by detailed numerical simulations .",
    "we have done so because of the considerable success with which this model has met in explaining a wide variety of blazar spectra in many different @xmath0-ray intensity states .",
    "we have discussed several alternative models , such as shock - in - jet models , leptonic cascade models and hadronic jet models .",
    "several of these possibilities could not be ruled out .",
    "detailed numerical calculations of the application of those models to our simultaneous broadband spectrum of bl  lacertae are beyond the scope of this paper , but we strongly encourage the authors of those models to do similar analyses so that a definitive conclusion in favor of a single model can be reached .    this research has made use of data from the university of michigan astronomy observatory , which is supported by the national science foundation and by funds from the university of michigan .",
    "we also note that the green bank interferometer is a facility of the national science foundation operated by the national radio astronomy observatory in support of the nasa high energy astrophysics programs .",
    "sdb has conducted this research as a natonal research council resident associate .",

    "we thank the referee for inspiring comments and suggestions , and j. mattox , a. marscher and p. sreekumar for many useful discussions .",
    "for the effects of compton scattering of accretion - disc radiation rescattered into the jet trajectory by surrounding clouds , the central accretion disc may be treated as a point source , radiating isotropically , since in the process of rescattering in the blr , virtually all spatial information about the point of origin of photons in the accretion disc gets lost .",
    "furthermore , the accretion disc spectrum is approximated by a single - temperature blackbody spectrum .",
    "the blackbody temperature @xmath118 is determined in a way that the resulting spectrum peaks at the same photon energy as the total photon spectrum of the shakura - sunyaev ( 1973 ) disc .",
    "this yields the photon production rate of the disc ,          throughout the appendix , the asterisk denotes quantities in the accretion disc rest frame , whereas quantities without asterisk denote quantities in the blob rest frame .",
    "@xmath123 is the dimensionless photon energy , and @xmath124 is the solid angle of emission of an accretion disc photon with respect to the jet axis .    following the treatment of rescattering in surrounding material as outlined in bttcher & dermer ( 1995 ) , but for a time - independent situation , we find for the differential photon number of rescattered accretion disc photons at height @xmath88 above the disc , in the stationary frame ,      where @xmath126 is the distance of the scattering location in the blr from the center of the accretion disc ( the black hole ) , and @xmath127 .",
    "@xmath128 follows from simple geometrical considerations , @xmath129 is the electron density in the blr at the location * r * which is determined by @xmath126 and @xmath128 .",
    "this photon density is transformed to the blob rest frame using the lorentz invariance of @xmath130 and        where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the angle cosine under which the photon enters the blob in the comiving and the stationary frame , respectively .",
    "the photon spectrum ( a3 ) is used in the procedure described in bms to calculate the electron energy - loss rate and the emitted photon spectrum due to inverse - compton scattering .",
    "if the blob is located well within the inner boundary of the blr , @xmath135 , the energy - loss rate can be well approximated assuming that all rescattered photons enter the blob from the front , i. e. with @xmath136 .",
