    "various galaxy surveys in the optical , near - infrared , and sub - mm have uncovered different galaxy populations at redshift @xmath1 ( see steidel , cimatti , and chapman in these proceedings for discussions ) , but whether these galaxies are representative of the galaxy population at high redshifts or how they are related to the present - day population is not clear .",
    "for example , rest - frame uv - selected samples are presumably sensitive to active star - forming galaxies and biased against evolved , quiescent systems that are faint at ultraviolet wavelengths , while sub - mm samples select mostly dusty star - forming galaxies . in contrast , near - infrared based surveys are sensitive to early - type galaxies at @xmath2 that have red optical and near - infrared colors and are known to dominate the total stellar mass at @xmath3 .",
    "a complete sample of massive systems at different epoch allows us to study the history of stellar mass assembly and offers important clues for discriminating between different galaxy formation scenarios ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "but past studies based on near - infrared surveys have yielded inconsistent space density measurements of red galaxies at @xmath4 ( see @xcite for a list of references ) .",
    "early - type galaxies are strongly clustered and have no prominent narrow - band spectral features at uv wavelengths .",
    "if these red galaxies are progenitors of early - type galaxies we see in the local universe ( rather than dusty star - forming galaxies ) , then a wide - field infrared survey is required to minimize the effect of surface density variation between fields due to strong clustering ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , deep galaxy spectroscopy is required to obtain a complete sample of these massive systems for spectral diagnostics of their ism and stellar content .    the las campanas infrared survey ( lcirs ) and gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ) are complementary studies designed to probe the nature of red galaxies and to determine mass assembly history using near - infrared selected galaxies . in the following section",

    "the lcirs is a deep , wide - field near - infrared and optical imaging survey , designed to identify a large number of red galaxies at @xmath0 , while securing a uniform sample of galaxies of all types to @xmath10 using photometric redshift techniques ( @xcite ) .",
    "the primary objectives are : ( 1 ) to examine the nature of the red galaxy population and identify evolved galaxies at redshifts @xmath11 ; ( 2 ) to study the space density and luminosity evolution of early - type galaxies at redshifts @xmath12 ; and ( 3 ) to measure spatial clustering of massive galaxies , thereby inferring merger rates of these galaxies for constraining theoretical models .",

    "the size of our survey area was determined in order to obtain a representative measure of the surface density of red galaxies and a significant signal in clustering analysis @xcite .",
    "five random fields have been chosen and each field covers @xmath21 , corresponding to a projected co - moving distance 20 @xmath22 mpc .",
    "this is twice the correlation length observed for early - type galaxies at @xmath3 ( see @xcite for references ) .",
    "the large survey area of the lcirs allows us to estimate empirically the uncertainties in the surface density measurements of red galaxies identified in smaller - area surveys , assuming that the lcirs galaxy sample are representative of these systems at @xmath4 .",
    "figure 1 shows the results based on red galaxies with @xmath23 found in non - overlapping , random sub - areas within the lcirs fields , in comparison to 0.83 arcmin@xmath8 as the nominal surface density of @xmath23 galaxies determined based on the entire lcirs red sample .",
    "we find based on the curves that a survey area of at least 70 arcmin@xmath24 is necessary to identify a statistically representative sample of red galaxies .",
    "our initial clustering analysis based on an @xmath16-band selected sample over 0.62 deg@xmath24 of sky shows that red galaxies with @xmath25 have a co - moving correlation length of @xmath26 mpc at @xmath27 , comparable to that of present - day early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "photometric redshifts have been determined for the entire lcirs galaxy sample based on a combination of available optical @xmath28 and near - infrared @xmath29 photometry @xcite , making the lcirs a _ complete _ redshift survey of faint galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "but because of relatively large redshift uncertainties , accounting for these errors in all analyses that make use of photometric redshift measurements is necessary to minimize systematic errors . adopting an @xmath16-band selected sample and using a technique that explicitly accounts for the _ non - gaussian characteristics _ of photometric redshift uncertainties",
    ", we have shown that the evolution of the rest - frame @xmath30-band co - moving luminosity density @xmath31 is characterized by @xmath32 and that luminous early - type galaxies exhibit only moderate evolution over @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "rest - frame @xmath34- and @xmath9-band luminosity functions have also been calculated using @xmath13 @xmath9-band selected galaxies at @xmath35 .",
    "figure 2 shows the best - fit luminosity functions in @xmath34 ( left panel ) and @xmath9 ( right panel ) using modified stepwise maximum likelihood method and sty approach as described in chen et al .",
    "the best - fit schechter parameters are @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "figure 2 also shows that our results are consistent at the bright end with the estimates presented by the k20 team for 170 galaxies found at @xmath15 over a total sky area of 52 arcmin@xmath24 @xcite ( dashed curves ) , but exhibit a hint of a turn - over at the faint - end .",
    "comparisons with existing measurements for local galaxies using 2mass data @xcite indicate that there is approximately @xmath38 mag fading in luminous ( @xmath39 ) near - infrared selected galaxies from @xmath40 to @xmath3 , the amount of which may be explained by stellar evolution over the same period of time .",
    "these results together suggest little / no evolution in the space density of massive early - type galaxies since @xmath41 and support the hypothesis that these systems were formed at redshift much beyond @xmath41 .",
    "the gdds is an ultra - deep spectroscopic survey of near - infrared selected galaxies at @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the primary objectives are : ( 1 ) to obtain spectral diagnostics of the ism and stellar content of massive galaxies at high redshift ; ( 2 ) to construct the stellar mass function over the target redshift range ; and ( 3 ) to determine ages and star - formation histories of evolved systems at @xmath11 .    the survey makes use of nod & shuffle observing mode @xcite for accurate sky subtraction and fringe removal at wavelength beyond 7500  .",
    "it is aimed at identifying near - infrared selected faint galaxies at @xmath43 to a high completeness level .",
    "we have observed 301 spectra in four fields using gmos on gemini north .",
    "each of the four fields covers @xmath44 field of view and is located in a separate lcirs field .",
    "the pointing and target selection of the gdds sample is guided by known information in the wider - field lcirs sample to maximize the efficiency of identifying a representative sample of faint galaxies at @xmath43 .",
    "for example , each gdds pointing is selected from within an lcirs field to have the number of red galaxies comparable to the global mean , which is important for reliable volume density analyses of early - type galaxies .",
    "in addition , we exclude foreground contaiminating sources at @xmath45 using photometric redshifts available for all lcirs sources .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows a comparison of the observed @xmath46 color versus @xmath47 for cfrs @xcite , gdds @xcite , and uv - selected galaxies @xcite .",
    "it demonstrates that the gdds is probing a representative galaxy population concentrated at @xmath48 with a broad - range of star formation history , from quiescent through active star - forming systems .",
    "conversely , the gdds results offer necessary tests and verification of the accuracy of lcirs photometric redshifts .",

    "the full sample of gdds spectra is presented in abraham et al .",
    "@xcite . specifically , we show in panel ( a ) the composite spectrum of early - type ( absorption - line dominated ) galaxies , panel ( b ) intermediate - type galaxies , and in panel ( c ) late - type ( emission - line dominated ) galaxies . for comparison , we include in panel ( a ) the sdss composite for luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) at @xmath56 @xcite ( red curve ) .",

    "rest - frame uv magnitude versus inferred stellar mass for galaxies in three redshift intervals .",
    "the solid line indicates the minimum uv flux of the galaxies included for the composite spectrum presented in panel ( f ) of figure 4.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in addition , we have constructed a composite spectrum for 13 @xmath9-band selected galaxies at @xmath66 from the gdds sample that are also luminous in the uv with @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "a normalized version is shown in panel ( f ) of figure 4 , together with a normalized composite spectrum of local starburst galaxies from tremonti et al .",
    "the composite spectrum shows prominent absorption features from mgii , feii together with mgi and mnii , all of which are stronger than those observed in local starburst systems .",
    "it indicates that the ism of these massive star - forming galaxies has been heavily enriched with metals by @xmath68 .",
    "based on a curve - of - growth analysis of all available transitions , savaglio et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find a mean feii column density of @xmath69 that is among the highest observed in either known damped ly@xmath70 absorption systems or in the ism of host galaxies of gamma - ray bursts ( figure 5a ) . while the metallicity is uncertain due to the unknown neutral hydrogen content , it is clear that the ism of these galaxies contains abundant heavy elements .",
    "because of the unknown nature of the galaxies that give rise to damped ly@xmath70 systems , direct column density measurements of the ism of luminous galaxies at high redshift offer a promising alternative for understanding cosmic chemical enrichment history",
    ".    we also determine the formation epoch of the stars seen in quiescent systems that show no signs of recent star formation ( lack of emission features in the rest - frame uv ) . using a likelihood analysis",
    ", we derive a minimum age for each system by comparing predicted spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from different stellar synthesis models with the observed ones established from the gdds spectra and available lcirs optical and near - infrared photometry .",
    "an example is shown in panel ( d ) of figure 4 for a red galaxy at @xmath71 . the model ( blue curve )",
    "was obtained for a single burst occurring at @xmath63 and passively evolving to lower redshift .",
    "the agreement between the observed spectrum and models suggests that this galaxy is at least 3.5 gyr old , pushing the formation epoch of this galaxy to beyond @xmath63 ( mccarthy et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "finally , we estimate the total stellar mass of every galaxy in the gdds sample using a @xmath9-band mass - to - light ratio determined from comparing the observed multi - color data with a grid of model seds with varying dust extinction , metallicity , and star formation history .",
    "figure 5(b ) shows rest - frame uv flux ( expressed in @xmath72 ) versus the inferred stellar masses of individual galaxies in three redshift bins spanned by the gdds sample .",
    "we see that a large fraction of the gdds galaxies have masses @xmath73 , and these systems exhibit on average increasing rest - frame uv fluxes ( and therefore increasing star formation rate ) with increasing redshift . in addition , while few systems with stellar masses @xmath74 are seen at @xmath75 in the gdds sample due to the @xmath9 limit of the survey , a tendency for the most massive galaxies to be uv quiescent is found in the low - redshift sample ( crosses)a trend which is similar to what is seen at @xmath3 .",
    "this result supports the view that most star formation takes place in lower mass systems even at @xmath11 ( glazebrook et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the wide - field multi - color imaging data from the lcirs and the high - quality nearly complete spectral sample from the gdds together allow us to conduct a comprehensive study of massive early - type galaxies at @xmath57 .",
    "our luminosity function analysis indicates that most and perhaps all of the present - day infrared luminous galaxies were in place by @xmath76 .",
    "the rest - frame uv spectra of massive star - forming systems show abundant metals that arise in the ism of these galaxies , indicating an early heavy element enrichment by @xmath77 .",
    "finally , spectral synthesis modelling showed that near - infrared selected galaxies at @xmath11 are massive and that the quiescent ones with no evidence of recent star formation are genuinely old and likely to form at @xmath78 .",
    "together these results suggest a rapid and early formation process of massive galaxies , presenting difficulties for conventiional hierarchical formation scenarios ."
