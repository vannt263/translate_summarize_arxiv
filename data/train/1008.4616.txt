    "with the prevalence of ever wider and deeper redshift surveys , from the second center for astrophysics redshift survey @xcite to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , we have refined our ability to identify the elongated filaments , sheetlike walls and dense compact clusters that compose the cosmic web @xcite .",
    "these structures surround voids , enormous regions @xmath4 mpc in diameter that are largely devoid of galaxies and occupy most of the volume of the universe ( @xcite ; for a recent review see @xcite ) . within these underdense  but not empty  regions , large galaxy redshift surveys have allowed us to distinguish an environmentally defined population of void galaxies residing in regions up to 10 times less dense than the cosmic mean .",
    "largely unaffected by the complexities and processes modifying galaxies in high - density environments , these isolated void regions are expected to hold important clues to understanding the environmental influences on galaxy formation and evolution @xcite . additionally , the apparent underabundance of galaxies in the void regions may present a challenge for currently favored galaxy formation theories @xcite , while their distribution is expected to trace substructure within voids , tenuous features which are fossil remnants of the hierarchical buildup of the cosmic web @xcite .",
    "void galaxies appear to have a more youthful state of star formation . as a population , void galaxies are statistically bluer , have a later morphological type , and have higher specific star formation rates than galaxies in average density environments @xcite .",
    "whether void galaxies are intrinsically different or whether their characteristics are simply due to the low mass bias of the galaxy luminosity function in low density regions is still an issue of discussion .",
    "overall , the mean colors of the red and blue void galaxy populations , taken separately , are comparable to galaxies in average density environments at the same luminosity , though an excess of blue galaxies is apparent @xcite .",
    "this suggests that in some respects the general underdensity of the environment has had little to no impact on their development , raising the question of to what extent the global ( @xmath520 mpc ) as opposed to local ( @xmath51 mpc ) environment shapes the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "@xcite suggest that it is only the morphology and luminosity of void galaxies which is dependent on their environment , with all other statistical correlations stemming from these two key parameters .",
    "interestingly , they and others find contradictory indications of a slight blueward shift of the blue cloud in voids at fixed luminosity @xcite .",
    "no such shift has been found for the red sequence of early type galaxies .",
    "less is known about the gas content of void galaxies .",
    "@xcite surveyed galaxies within the botes void with pointed observations of 24 _ iras _ selected galaxies , of which 16 were detected .",
    "most of these galaxies are found to be gas - rich and disk - like , with many gas - rich companions , however more complete redshift surveys show that many of the targeted galaxies reside in the outer realms of the void and with some reason might be identified with the moderate density environment of walls ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see section  [ sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "@xcite find that dwarf galaxies in voids have a higher @xmath6 ratio the deeper within the underdensity they reside . because of the active star - forming nature of void galaxies , detailed h i observations",
    "are key to understanding the environmental differences observed .",
    "the unique nature of void galaxies provides an ideal chance to distinguish the role of environment in gas accretion and galaxy evolution on an individual basis .",
    "fresh gas accretion is necessary for galaxies to maintain star formation rates seen today without depleting their observed gas mass in less than a hubble time @xcite .",
    "historically , this gas was assumed to condense out of reservoirs of hot gas existing in halos around galaxies @xcite , with some amount of gas recycling via galactic fountains @xcite .",
    "however , recent simulations have renewed interest in the slow accretion of cold gas along filaments @xcite .",
    "void galaxies provide a unique sample of younger , star forming galaxies where their inherent isolation may allow us to distinguish the effects of close encounters and galaxy mergers from other mechanisms of gas accretion , and their constrained environment allows a search for systematic trends in neutral gas content and distribution with cosmological density .",
    "despite the remarkable success of @xmath7cdm cosmology in explaining the general cosmic matter distribution there are a few telling discrepancies , the most prominent of which concerns the over - prediction of low - mass halos within voids @xcite .",
    "the observed density of faint ( @xmath8 ) galaxies in voids is only @xmath9th that of the mean @xcite , in contrast to the predictions of high - resolution @xmath7cdm simulations that the density of low mass halos ( @xmath10 ) should be @xmath11th that of the cosmic mean @xcite .",
    "in addition , simulations predict that these low mass halos will trail into the voids , while in deep optical surveys we see that dwarf galaxies avoid the empty regions defined by the more luminous galaxies @xcite . this phenomenon has also been noted in blind h i surveys @xcite and deep surveys of the local volume @xcite , where in general most void galaxies are found at the edges of voids .",
    "@xcite has strongly emphasized that this dearth of dwarf and/or low surface brightness galaxies in voids can not be straightforwardly understood in our standard view of galaxy formation .",
    "there have been many solutions proposed which aim to limit galaxy formation within the least massive halos @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the void phenomenon might be understood if the properties of galaxies are solely dependent on the mass of the dark halos in which they live , independent of their environment , assuming a sufficiently tailored halo occupation distribution .",
    "however , it remains difficult to explain how the implied severe degrees of bias between high- and low - luminosity galaxies at the void boundaries can be reconciled with the observations of nearby voids : there are no indications for the predicted segregation of fainter galaxies being found further into the void interior ( vogeley , private communication ) .",
    "it is also revealing that predictions for the galaxy distribution in void regions by different semi - analytical galaxy formation schemes , in the context of the millennium simulation or other simulations @xcite , disagree with each other at a remarkably fundamental level ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . ultimately , we will need a better understanding of the various gas , radiation and feedback processes , such as investigated by @xcite .",
    "the issue remains far from solved , and progress will largely depend on new observations .    within the context of hierarchical cosmological structure formation scenarios ,",
    "voids are expected to exhibit a rich dark matter substructure which is a remnant of the hierarchical buildup of voids and provides additional constraints on theories of cosmological evolution @xcite .",
    "the merging of expanding voids dilutes the intervening substructure to cause a cosmic flow away from the void centers and along walls and filaments @xcite .",
    "the extent to which the tenuous void substructure may also be recognized in the galaxy distribution is not yet fully settled , however there may be a link between the star formation activity of void galaxies and the influx of ( coldly ) accreting matter transported along dark matter filaments @xcite .",
    "some observational studies claim to recognize patterns in the void galaxy distribution @xcite . moreover , there are indications that the clustering of galaxies in voids appears to be of comparable strength to that of galaxies in average density environments @xcite , possibly related to the strong clustering of voids and their primordial precursors @xcite .",
    "we have undertaken a new multi - wavelength void galaxy survey ( vgs ) of @xmath560 geometrically selected void galaxies .",
    "in this project we intend to study in detail the gas content , star formation history and stellar content , as well as the kinematics and dynamics of void galaxies and their companions in a broad sample of void environments .",
    "each of the galaxies has been selected from the deepest interior regions of identified voids in the sdss redshift survey on the basis of a unique geometric technique , described in section  [ sec : select ] , with no a priori selection on intrinsic properties of the void galaxies ( ie .",
    "luminosity or color ) .",
    "we present here the results of a pilot study , observing 15 void galaxies in h i at the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) . our selection procedure for this pilot sample and for the full vgs",
    "are explained in section  [ sec : select ] .",
    "our observations , detailed in section  [ sec : obs ] , have sufficient sensitivity and resolution to allow us to map the gas distribution and kinematics for each of our target galaxies .",
    "in addition , the large field of view and wide redshift range allows a simultaneous detection of faint nearby companions , as well as background galaxies residing in higher density regions .",
    "this allows a very accurate determination of the local environment and direct evidence of gas interactions .",
    "a detailed presentation of the results is given in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "an extensive analysis of the void galaxy properties is the subject of section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "a discussion of our preliminary findings and speculations as to their implications are to be found in section  [ sec : speculation ] , with conclusions presented in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . throughout the paper we have assumed h@xmath12 , except where noted .",
    "voids are the ( mostly ) empty regions between the filaments , walls and clusters in the cosmic web .",
    "while these large underdense regions represent one of the most prominent aspects of the cosmic matter distribution , there is no unanimity with respect to their definition . unlike e.g. clusters of galaxies",
    ", voids are not well - defined physical objects .",
    "instead , they are the regions surrounding the minima in the cosmic matter and galaxy distribution .",
    "different opinions exist on their extent and boundary , the medium with respect to which they should be identified , and the practical implementation of such definitions to the galaxy distribution . as a result , there is a large variety of void finding formalisms .",
    "some refer to the galaxy distribution , while others use the dark matter density field .",
    "some identify isolated spherical voids , while others attempt to reconstruct the nontrivial void shapes and geometries by means of overlapping spheres or cubes .",
    "while all methods can generally identify an underdense volume , they differ significantly in identifying the location of the edge of the void .",
    "a telling illustration of this can be found in the overview and quantitative comparison of various void finding algorithms by @xcite .",
    "the challenge for studies of voids is therefore to identify them in an unbiased and cleanly defined manner . for our purpose",
    "it is of key importance that we make no a priori assumptions about the scale and shape of voids , and that we find voids entirely independent of the intrinsic properties of galaxies . to this end",
    ", we invoke a unique geometric void finding algorithm .",
    "it is purely based on the local spatial structure of the galaxy distribution and guarantees the definition of an unbiased sample of void galaxies .",
    "our galaxy sample is defined on the basis of the optical sdss redshift survey , which covers over 10,000 square degrees and catalogs redshifts for over 900,000 galaxies brighter than 17.77 petrosian magnitudes in the @xmath13-band and more than 55@xmath14 away from any other cataloged galaxy .",
    "the pilot program void galaxies were selected from the sdss data release 3 ( dr3 ) , while the full void galaxy survey uses the complete dr7 .",
    "the first step in detecting void galaxies is outlining the voids in the survey volume .",
    "it is important for our purpose that we follow a strictly geometric procedure .",
    "this involves the reconstruction of the density field from the spatial galaxy distribution , followed by the identification of void regions within the spatial density field .",
    "finally , we search for the sdss galaxies which lie within the interior of the identified voids .      for the density field reconstruction we use the dtfe procedure , the delaunay tessellation field estimator @xcite .",
    "this technique translates the spatial distribution of the galaxies in the sdss , in a volume from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , into a continuous density field .",
    "in addition to the computational efficiency of the procedure , the density maps produced by dtfe have the virtue of retaining the anisotropic and hierarchical structures which are so characteristic of the cosmic web @xcite .",
    "the recent in - depth analysis by @xcite has shown that for very large point samples , the dtfe even outperforms more elaborate high - order methods with respect to quantitative and statistical evaluations of the density field . as a result ,",
    "the dtfe density field is highly suited for objectively tracing structural features such as walls , filaments and voids .",
    "the dtfe procedure involves four steps .",
    "the first step is the definition of the galaxy sample and corresponding survey volume .",
    "the subsequent step consists of the computation of the delaunay tessellation defined by the spatial galaxy distribution .",
    "dtfe exploits the adaptivity of this tessellation to the local density and geometry of the generating spatial point process .",
    "the third step involves the local density estimate at each of the sample galaxies positions .",
    "this is based on the volume of the contiguous voronoi cell , the volume defined by all delaunay tetrahedra to which a given sample galaxy belongs . in the final step ,",
    "these local density values form the basis for a piecewise linear interpolation within the volume of each delaunay tetrahedron . in this , the delaunay tessellation field estimator is the multidimensional equivalent of simple piecewise one - dimensional linear interpolation from an irregularly distributed set of points which uses the delaunay triangulation as an adaptive and irregular interpolation grid .",
    "the resulting product of the dtfe procedure is a volume - covering continuous density field . for a an extensive description of the full dtfe procedure",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "below we shortly describe the key steps of the dtfe machinery .",
    "_ sdss dr3 sample _ + the sdss dr3 galaxy sample is a _",
    "limited sample , consisting of galaxies brighter than @xmath17 . for our density field determination",
    "we take all sampled information , which makes it necessary to correct for the inhomogeneous selection process . by default",
    ", we assume that all galaxies - independent of their luminosity - are a fair tracer of the underlying galaxy density field .    following this assumption , we correct for the dilution as a function of survey depth by weighing each sample galaxy by the reciprocal @xmath18 of the radial selection function @xmath19 at the distance of the galaxy .",
    "for the sdss , the selection function @xmath19 as a function of redshift @xmath20 is well fitted by the expression forwarded by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the characteristic redshift of the distribution and @xmath23 specifies the steepness of the curve .    _ delaunay tessellation _ + the * delaunay tessellation * of the galaxy distribution divides up the sample volume in a unique volume - covering tiling of tetrahedra .",
    "each of these delaunay tetrahedra is defined by a set of four galaxies in such a way that their circumscribing spheres does not contain any of the other galaxies of the generating galaxy sample @xcite . for practical purposes ,",
    "we assume _ vacuum boundary conditions _ : outside the sdss galaxy sample volume we take the minimal assumption of having no galaxies . for its efficient computation",
    "we use the cgal library .",
    "_ dtfe density estimate _ + the dtfe density value estimate at the location of each galaxy is taken to be inversely proportional to the volume of the _ contiguous voronoi cell _",
    ", i.e. the region defined by all delaunay tetrahedra of which a given galaxy is a vertex . for a sample galaxy @xmath24",
    ", we identify all @xmath25 neighbouring delaunay tetrahedra @xmath26 , which together constitute the contiguous voronoi cell @xmath27 .",
    "summation of the individual tetrahedral volumes @xmath28 yields the volume of the contiguous voronoi cell , @xmath29 the resulting dtfe estimate @xmath30 of the density field at sample point @xmath24 is @xmath31 where the weight @xmath32 is the sample selection weight at the galaxies redshift @xmath33 .",
    "note that the factor of four takes account of the fact that in three dimensions each sample point belongs to four tetrahedra . in practice ,",
    "the density of all galaxies is calculated by looping in sequence over all delaunay tetrahedra .",
    "_ dtfe density field interpolation _ + dtfe uses the adaptive and minimum triangulation properties of delaunay tessellations to use the tessellations as adaptive spatial interpolation intervals for irregular point distributions @xcite . by doing so , the dtfe generalizes the concept of a natural interpolation interval to any dimension @xmath34 .",
    "once the delaunay tessellation has been constructed , and the densities at each sample point determined , the dtfe determines the density gradient within each delaunay tetrahedron @xmath26 .",
    "the gradient can be directly inferred from the density values at its four vertices , i.e. at the location of the four sample galaxies defining the tetrahedron .",
    "following the determination of the density gradients in all delaunay tetrahedra , the dtfe density value at any point @xmath35 within the sample volume can be calculated by determining in which tetrahedron it is located and subsequently computing its density estimate from the simple linear interpolation equation . to obtain an image of the density field",
    ", the density is calculated at each of the voxel locations of the image grid .",
    "the watershed void finder ( wvf , @xcite ) is applied to the dtfe density field for identifying its underdense void basins .",
    "the wvf is an implementation of the _ watershed transform _ for segmentation of images of the galaxy and matter distribution into distinct regions and objects and the subsequent identification of voids .    the basic idea behind the watershed",
    "transform finds its origin in geophysics .",
    "it delineates the boundaries of the separate domains , the _ basins _ , into which yields of e.g. rainfall will collect .",
    "the analogy with the cosmological context is straightforward . by equating the cosmic density field to a landscape",
    ", the wvf identifies the valleys with _",
    "cosmic voids_. they are separated from each other by boundaries consisting of the _ walls _ and _ filaments _ in the cosmic web .",
    "these are identified with the related spine formalism @xcite .",
    "the wvf consists of eight steps , which are extensively outlined in @xcite . for the success of the wvf it is of the utmost importance that the density field retains its topology . to this end ,",
    "the two essential first steps relate directly to dtfe , which guarantees the correct representation of the hierarchical nature , the weblike morphology dominated by filaments and walls , and the presence of voids @xcite . because in and around low - density void regions the raw density field",
    "is characterized by a relatively high level of noise , a second essential step suppresses the noise using a r@xmath36= 1 @xmath37 mpc gaussian filter .",
    "the subsequent central step of the wvf formalism consists of the application of the discrete watershed transform on this filtered density field . thus providing us with a set of voids .",
    "analysis of mock catalogs show that a choice of r@xmath36 = 1 @xmath37 mpc recovers the majority of small scale voids , and within distances of 100 @xmath37 mpc errors are dominated by the inherent limitations of the observational redshift survey @xcite .",
    "unlike most void finders , the wvf has the advantage of having no a priori assumptions about scale and shape of voids ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a comparison of different algorithms ) . instead ,",
    "these are completely determined by the topological structure of the cosmic density field . because it identifies a void segment on the basis of the crests in a density field surrounding a density minimum , it is able to trace the void boundary even though it has a distorted and twisted shape . also , because the contours around well chosen minima are by definition closed , the transform is not sensitive to local protrusions between two adjacent voids .",
    "a representative dtfe density map in a slice through the sdss galaxy distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : sdssmapvoid ] , with superimposed symbols indicating the original spatial distribution of galaxies and subsequently determined void galaxies .      upon having obtained the complete list of voids in the sdss survey volume , and the spectroscopically targeted void galaxies within their realm , we evaluate for each of the galaxies whether it conforms to a set of additional criteria",
    ". the galaxy should be    * located in the interior central region of clearly defined voids , if possible near the center , and be as far removed from the boundary of the voids as possible . *",
    "removed from the edge of the sdss survey volume , as we do not wish to have galaxies in voids which extend past the edge of the sdss coverage .",
    "* not within @xmath38 km s@xmath39 from a foreground or background cluster .",
    "this assures that the presence in a void of a galaxy can not be attributed to the finger of god effect . *",
    "preferably within a redshift @xmath40 , allowing sufficient sensitivity and resolution in our observations of the gas structure and kinematics in the galaxies .",
    "other than the sdss redshift survey limit of @xmath41 there is no selection on luminosity or color of the void galaxies in our sample , the selection is purely dictated by the local geometric structure of the cosmic web .",
    "the spectroscopic selection criteria of the sdss do exclude bright , nearby galaxies and omit some galaxies in particularly crowded fields , however these effects are not relevant to our sample .",
    "there is also a poorly constrained surface brightness selection in the sdss main galaxy sample .",
    "apart from avoiding the finger of god effect , note that redshift distortions due to cosmic large scale flows , and as a result of cluster infall , are not affecting our selection .",
    "these tend to amplify the density and contrast of filaments , sheets and cluster outskirts in redshift space , while leading to emptier voids : void galaxies detected in redshift space are therefore highly likely to also live in physical voids ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "figure  [ fig : select ] illustrates our selection procedure for two cases .",
    "the locations of the void galaxy in the sdss footprint ( heavy dot , top right ) are removed from the survey edge and each other .",
    "the dtfe density map in two mutually perpendicular slices intersecting at the galaxy location , along the line pointing radially towards the observer ( bottom left and center ) , show their position centrally located in the deepest underdensities . to accentuate this",
    ", the images also contain a map of the spinal / watershed contours of the density field overlaid on top of the distance field in order to give an idea of the spatial structure of the surrounding large scale structure ( top left ) .",

    "<S> void galaxies , residing within the deepest underdensities of the cosmic web , present an ideal population for the study of galaxy formation and evolution in an environment undisturbed by the complex processes modifying galaxies in clusters and groups , as well as provide an observational test for theories of cosmological structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> we have completed a pilot survey for the h i imaging aspects of a new void galaxy survey ( vgs ) , imaging 15 void galaxies in h i in local ( @xmath0 mpc ) voids . </S>",
    "<S> h i masses range from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , with one nondetection with an upper limit of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our galaxies were selected using a structural and geometric technique to produce a sample that is purely environmentally selected and uniformly represents the void galaxy population . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we use a powerful new backend of the westerbork synthesis radio telescope that allows us to probe a large volume around each targeted galaxy , simultaneously providing an environmentally constrained sample of fore- and background control sample of galaxies while still resolving individual galaxy kinematics and detecting faint companions in h i. this small sample makes up a surprisingly interesting collection of perturbed and interacting galaxies , all with small stellar disks . </S>",
    "<S> four galaxies have significantly perturbed h i disks , five have previously unidentified companions at distances ranging from 50 to 200 kpc , two are in interacting systems , and one was found to have a polar h i disk . </S>",
    "<S> our initial findings suggest void galaxies are a gas - rich , dynamic population which present evidence of ongoing gas accretion , major and minor interactions , and filamentary alignment despite the surrounding underdense environment . </S>"
