    "the standard cosmological model describes the evolution of an isotropic and homogeneous background as required by the cosmological principle , that is of a spacetime with metric : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the conformal time and @xmath3 , the scale factor .",
    "the constant @xmath4 determines the spatial topology of the universe , with @xmath5 corresponding to open , flat and closed topologies . for a given matter content @xmath6 , metric ( [ eq : frw ] ) extremizes the action @xmath7=\\int{d}^4x\\sqrt{-g}\\left ( \\frac1{2\\kappa}(r-2\\lambda)+l_{\\text{m}}\\right),\\ ] ] by solving the einstein equations @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the einstein constant and @xmath10 is the planck mass .    supported by the observational data ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) , from the corresponding solutions of ( [ eq : eeqs ] ) a consistent picture of the cosmological history emerged where an early very flat universe filled with a quark - gluon plasma started to expand and , consequently , to get colder , giving rise to many phase transitions in the matter content .",
    "this big bang picture involves a mixture of fluids , however , since the density of each fluid varies differently with the expansion , there are long periods of time where the energy of a given fluid is dominant while the other ones are subdominant .",
    "this way , the early radiation dominated phase was replaced , about @xmath11 years later , by an intermediate era dominated by pressureless matter ( baryonic and of an unknown kind coined dark ) . by the end of the last century",
    "it was observationally established that very recently our observable universe became dominated by some energy ( also of an unknown kind and also coined dark ) doing a positive work which induces accelerated expansion .",
    "all of the above mentioned matter phases can be modeled with barotropic fluids given by an equation of state @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 stand , correspondingly , for the pressure and energy density of the fluid , while @xmath15 is the , so called , constant of state . in the appendix [ sec : sf_bpf ] it is shown that the solution of ( [ eq : eeqs ] ) for a barotropic fluid in a flat frw universe with @xmath16 is @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( see also appendix [ sec : sf_conf - cosm ] ) . for radiation @xmath19 ,",
    "what corresponds to @xmath20 , while for pressureless matter ( baryonic or dark ) @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 corresponds to the case of a cosmological constant @xmath0 , which is the simplest candidate for the dark energy .",
    "the accelerating solution with @xmath24 is known as the de sitter spacetime and , for a flat universe , is the case with @xmath25 ( see appendix [ sec : appds ] ) .",
    "since the background is homogeneous and isotropic , the picture above briefly drawn can not explain the existence of cosmic large scales structures . amongst some other problems",
    ", it neither explains why our universe looks so flat , given that , with a positive constant of state , the flat case is an unstable equilibrium of the cosmological dynamics @xcite . up to date , the best available solution to these problems is called cosmological inflation @xcite .",
    "it also describes an accelerated expansion , but at very early times , even before the formation of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the cosmological constant is not a good candidate for the inflationary matter because the de sitter universe is stable in the sense that it never ends to accelerate , thus never giving place to the rise and expansion of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "therefore , perhaps the simplest scenario is that of the energy density in the very early universe being dominated by the potential energy of a single real scalar field called inflaton",
    ". then , the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton served as the seeds for the formation of large scale structure and of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "an interesting model is power - law inflation , where the scale factor is given by ( [ eq : powlawsf ] ) with @xmath26 , and the potential @xmath27 , as function of the field @xmath28 , is given by @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "it has several attractive features concerning theory and observations .",
    "first of all , the exponential function is the limit of a taylor series similar to the tree expansion often used for scalar field potentials arising in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "second , the exponential potential is the only inflationary model yielding exact power - law spectra @xcite , and because the deviation of the spectra amplitudes from scale - invariance is predicted to be very small , the power - law parametrization of the primordial spectra is used very often while analyzing the cmb data @xcite .",
    "this whole description of the evolution of our universe is known as the @xmath30 model and is pointed out , so far , as the best theoretical framework for studying this evolution by the data from highly accurate satellite and ground - based observations@xcite . nevertheless , in a spite of the success of the @xmath30 model , there is still a large number of open questions in cosmology , perhaps the more relevant being what is the matter content of our universe .",
    "we do not know what are the dark energy , the dark matter or the inflaton .",
    "typically , candidates for these kinds of matter are accepted or discarded considering the impact they have on the behavior of the scale factor , which in turn determines the values of most cosmological observables .",
    "there are , however , special nontrivial matter configurations with no backreaction on the gravitational field , i.e. , which existence does not affect the evolution of the underlying spacetime .",
    "scalar fields with this property were firstly found for the static btz black hole @xcite , minkowski flat space @xcite , and ( a)ds space @xcite .",
    "they were coined gravitational _",
    "stealths_. later , the existence of stealths was shown for the de  sitter cosmology @xcite .",
    "the relevance they have for the probability of nucleation of such universes was emphasized in ref.@xcite .    moreover , in ref.@xcite it is shown that not only de  sitter universes , but _ any _ homogeneous and isotropic universe , independently of its spatial topology and matter content , allows for the presence of a conformal stealth which evolves along with the universe without exhibiting its gravitational fingerprints .",
    "nevertheless , that result strongly depends on the fact that frw spacetimes are conformally flat .",
    "however , as is was already mentioned , the homogeneity and isotropicity of these spacetimes are just approximated symmetries of the actual universe .",
    "in fact , many important observables of the @xmath0cdm model are related to density perturbations around the time when radiation and matter densities were equal .",
    "density perturbations imply that the above mentioned symmetries of the frw spacetime are lost and , consequently , is also lost the conformal flatness leading to the existence of the stealth found in ref.@xcite . as a first step into solving the problem of the existence of a stealth in more realistic backgrounds , it is important to establish that such a field can also exist in cosmological spacetimes which are not conformally flat .",
    "therefore , in this paper we consider stealth configurations for more general nonminimal couplings , where no obvious conformal arguments can be used .    in the next section we state the problem for the general case and derive the relevant expressions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lcdm ] it is considered the problem for the @xmath30 model .",
    "we first show the existence of a class of stealths during a big bang era and then we present some examples of stealth potentials for different couplings during those eras of the @xmath30 model when the matter content was dominated by the energy of a single fluid leading to an expansion described by a given power  law scale factor .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : ds ] it is shown that the particular case of de sitter cosmologies allow for an inhomogeneous stealth .",
    "there is also a special value of the coupling that is studied in sec.[sec : spcase14 ] . in the last section we briefly summarized our conclusions",
    "let us start here by stating the problem of finding stealths scalar fields non  conformally coupled to gravity .",
    "as mentioned above , we start by using the friedman - lematre - robertson - walker metric ( [ eq : frw ] ) , with no assumption on the allowed spatial topology ( @xmath31 ) .",

    "@xmath48 ( with @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are integration constants whose dimensions are inverse lenght .",
    "now we use the combination    @xmath52    here @xmath53 is the hubble parameter and @xmath54 its derivative with respect to conformal time .    at this point , since @xmath55 depends on all the coordinates @xmath56 , it is difficult to do any further progress without some assumptions . of the energy - momentum tensor , since there is not room for confusion .",
    "] there are two assumptions that can be made which lead to _ inhomogeneous _ and _ homogeneous _ stealths respectively .",
    "first , we note that if the last term of expression ( [ eq : t_te^te - t_t^t ] ) vanishes , then the equation for the time dependent part of the stealth @xmath57 can be solved .",
    "that is the case when the coupling constant between the field and gravity is the conformal coupling in four dimensions , @xmath58 , which was analyzed in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , the final term also vanishes when the parentheses including the hubble parameter is zero , i.e. , @xmath59 in appendix [ sec : appds ] it is shown that the above expression yields the de sitter cosmologies , and we will find the corresponding _ inhomogeneous _ stealth in section [ sec : ds ] .",
    "a second assumption can be made if neither the bracket involving the non minimal coupling constant @xmath35 , nor the bracket involving the hubble parameter @xmath53 vanish in the last term of ( [ eq : t_te^te - t_t^t ] ) . in those cases",
    "we can take the partial derivative of this expression with respect to any spatial coordinate .",
    "then , the only way in which the constraint can be satisfied is when the stealth is _ homogeneous _ , that is @xmath60 . from equation ( [ eq : rtp ] )",
    "this homogeneity condition implies @xmath61 since this is an integration constant arising from a spacial equation .",
    "the above means that equation ( [ eq : t_te^te - t_t^t ] ) becomes a differential equation on @xmath2 with two unknown functions : the temporal dependence @xmath46 of the stealth and the hubble parameter @xmath53 in the conformal gauge .",
    "this way , we need first to fix the scale factor @xmath3 in order to be able to do any further progress . in the next section",
    "we will consider the scale factors which arise in the @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "perhaps the more interesting solution to the problem stated in the previous section is a stealth during the whole cosmological evolution as described by the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "otherwise , one could look for stealths existing during one or more of the eras comprising this evolution and check whether there could be a mechanism for the field decay by the end of these eras .",
    "as it was already mentioned , the big bang picture describes the evolution of the mixture of two kinds of barotropic perfect fluids : radiation and pressureless matter .",
    "let be @xmath62 and @xmath63 the densities for radiation and matter respectively , then one can solve for the scale factor as @xmath64 it can be shown that @xmath65 and @xmath66 . using the arguments of homogeneity aforementioned , with the scale factor given by eq.([eq : scafacradmatt ] ) the solution for eq .",

    "the usual way to deal with this problem is to write the explicit dependence of both the stealth and the scale factor on the coordinates ( in this case @xmath2 ) and then use the inverse relation between the stealth and the coordinates to show the explicit dependence @xmath74",

    "this is the case for the scale factor ( [ eq : scafacradmatt ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the stealth as function of the conformal time exists , implying that there could be a class of homogeneous stealths witnessing the whole big bang evolution .      in the previous subsection we have shown that there are stealths coexisting with pressureless matter and radiation , so that , in principle , there could be also stealths along the whole cosmological evolution .",
    "since the task of finding them is typically cumbersome , in order to determine the main properties of the stealths corresponding to ( [ eq : cumber ] ) , we will use the fact that for @xmath75 , the first factor in eq.([eq : scafacradmatt ] ) dominates indicating a radiation dominated era .",
    "conversely , for @xmath76 , the leading term is the second , corresponding to a matter dominated era . besides these eras ,",
    "another cosmological era of particular interest is inflation .",

    "the corresponding expresion for the stealth as function of the conformal time is given in terms of hypergeometric functions , what makes almost impossible to find the corresponding self ",
    "interaction potential .",
    "it is straightforward to deduce that the analougous task for the @xmath0cdm model would be even more difficult .",
    "nevertheless , it is also reasonable to conjecture that a homogeneous stealth for this model exists .",
    "one can get an idea of how the potential for the @xmath0cdm stealth would look like by solving the problem for each epoch of the cosmological evolution . during each one of these epochs",
    "the corresponding scale  factor has a given power ",
    "law dependence on the conformal time .",
    "here we solved the problem for homogeneous stealths during power ",
    "law inflation , radiation and matter dominated eras , and during de sitter expansion , which are the main epochs of the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "our results indicate two possibilities depending on the values of the coupling @xmath35 .",
    "first , there is a wide range of @xmath35 for which the potential looks like an inverted parabola in each one of the above mentioned epochs .",
    "this allows us to guess that this could be also the form of the potential of the @xmath0cdm stealth .",
    "secondly , for @xmath128 , it was found that in each of these epochs there is a homogeneous stealth with a potential having a local minimum . in turn , this allows for the possibility that a stealth could be present during any of the main epochs of the @xmath0cdm model and then decay after rolling to the minimum , perhaps giving rise to domain walls .",
    "since the stealth field is gravitationally undetectable , it would be particularly interesting to study this new kind of topological defects in detail .",
    "as we have already mentioned , it is important now to look for observational consequences of the existence of the @xmath0cdm stealth .",
    "an interesting fact is that its fluctuations are not necessarily stealth themselves .",
    "therefore , the corresponding stealth perturbations may have an observable imprint on the spectra of the cosmic microwave background radiation as well as in the statistics of the cosmological large scale structures .",
    "we plan to deal with this cases in the near future .",

    "the possibility of having a stealth field in the de sitter space has been studied in @xcite . in that work",
