    "many observed phenomena can be associated with wave - like motions , increasing interest in the study of wave dynamics .",
    "linear perturbation theory considers an arbitrary disturbance as a superposition of independently evolving eigenmodes , thus simplifying the description of the process .",
    "however , interactions between different harmonics as well as between different kind of waves leads to the appearance of substantially new phenomena .    in the case of large - amplitude acoustic waves",
    ", nonlinearity leads to the generation of higher harmonics which cause steepening of the wave front and consequently the formation of shock waves . also developments in plasma theory",
    "raise interest in the study of interactions between different waves .",
    "it is shown that nonlinear interaction leads to the generation of resonant triplets ( or multiplets ) in the plasma @xcite . the nonlinear interaction between magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd )",
    "waves has been studied in various astrophysical situations @xcite . additionally , mhd wave coupling due to inhomogeneity of the medium @xcite or a background flow @xcite has also been developed .",
    "recently , a new kind of interaction between sound and alfvn waves has been discussed by zaqarashvili [ 16 ] .",
    "the physical basis of this interaction is the parametric influence ; sound waves cause a periodical variation in the medium s parameters , which affects the velocity of transversal alfvn waves and leads to a resonant energy transformation into certain harmonics . in a high @xmath0 plasma , it is shown that periodical variations of the medium s density , caused by the propagation of sound waves along an applied magnetic field , results in alfvn waves being governed by mathieu s equation ( here @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the plasma pressure and @xmath3 is the magnetic field ) .",
    "consequently , harmonics with half the frequency of sound waves grow exponentially in time .",
    "the same phenomenon was developed in the case of standing sound waves @xcite .",
    "the process of energy exchange between these different kinds of wave motion is called _ swing wave - wave interaction_. this terminology arises from an analogy with a swinging pendulum , as described below .    in this paper",
    "we further develop the theory for interactions between fast magnetosonic waves and alfvn waves .",
    "for clarity of presentation we first recall the pendulum analogy and show that under certain conditions the energy of spring oscillations along the pendulum axis is transformed into the energy of transversal oscillations of the pendulum , and _",
    "vice versa_. following a discussion of the general physics of swing interaction we go on to consider the example of coupling between fast magnetosonic waves propagating across an applied magnetic field and alfvn waves propagating along the field .",
    "finally , we briefly describe the applications of the theory to various astrophysical situations .",
    "it is useful to begin with a mechanical analogy of the wave dynamics in a medium ( see @xcite in the case of three - wave interaction ) . consider a mathematical pendulum with mass @xmath4 and equilibrium length @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "part of the pendulum length consists of a spring with stiffness constant @xmath6 .",
    "there are two kinds of oscillation in this system : transversal oscillations due to gravity and spring oscillations along the pendulum axis due to the elasticity of the spring .",
    "this is a _",
    "swing pendulum_.    in equilibrium , gravity is balanced by the stiffness force @xmath7 of the spring so that @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gravitational acceleration and @xmath10 is the equilibrium length of the spring ( the natural length of the spring is supposed negligible ) .",
    "the swing pendulum in equilibrium ( left ) and in oscillation ( right).,width=264 ]    for displacement @xmath11 along the pendulum axis , the stiffness force becomes @xmath12 newton s second law applied along the pendulum axis , when the pendulum makes an angle @xmath13 with the vertical ( see fig.1 ) , gives the equation of motion ( the centrifugal force due to the transversal oscillation is neglected ) @xmath14    due to the oscillation of the spring along the axis , the pendulum length is a function of time and the equation of transversal motions of the pendulum under gravity is @xmath15 for clarity of presentation a term @xmath16 is here neglected ; it does not affect the physical nature of the phenomenon ( for general consideration , see @xcite ) .",
    "so we have two different oscillations of the pendulum , which are coupled , and each oscillation influences the other . considering small amplitude oscillations , we find two coupled equations governing the dynamics of the pendulum : @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the fundamental frequencies of the system",
    ".    from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we can see that longitudinal oscillations of the pendulum causes a periodical variation of the pendulum length . in certain conditions",
    "this can lead to the well known parametric amplification of transversal oscillations .",
    "when @xmath11 is a periodical function of time , then equation ( 2 ) becames mathieu s equation and it has a resonant solution when @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath22 .    under these conditions , initial spring oscillations , @xmath11 , along",
    "the pendulum axis can amplify small transversal perturbations , @xmath23 ( see equation ( 2 ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "transversal oscillations may be considered as an external periodic force ( see equation ( 1 ) ) which causes the damping and consequent amplification of longitudinal oscillations .",
    "so , in the absence of dissipation , there is a subsequent energy exchange between different oscillations in the system .",
    "but if some kind of external force supports the spring oscillations then they can amplify the transversal oscillations until nonlinear effects became significant .",
    "the generalisation of the above analogy to waves in a medium leads to interesting phenomena .",
    "spring oscillations do work against gravity and cause periodical variations of the parameter ( pendulum length @xmath5 ) of transversal oscillations . as a result of this work",
    ", the energy of spring oscillations transforms into the energy of transversal oscillations .",
    "so we may expect a similar process in a medium when one kind of waves cause a periodical variation of another wave parameters .",
    "there are three main forces in the equation of motion for an ideal conductive fluid : the pressure gradient @xmath24 , gravity @xmath25 , and the lorentz force @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath27 denote the plasma pressure and density , @xmath28 is the gravitational potential and @xmath29 is the current in a magnetic field @xmath30 .",
    "each of these forces represents the restoring force against the fluid inertia and thus leads to the generation of different kinds of wave motion .",
    "of these forces , only the lorentz force does not include the density ( in the pressure gradient the density arises from the equation of state ) .",
    "this fact leads to the appearance of the density in the expression for the magnetic speed , the alfvn speed @xmath31 , which describes the propagation of magnetic waves and depends on the medium density @xmath32 . for a similar reason , the frequency of pendulum oscillations does not depend on the pendulum mass ( because the gravitational force depends on it ) , while the frequency of spring oscillation does depend on the mass ( because the stiffness force does not depend on it ) .",
    "on the other hand , compressible waves cause density variations in the medium and therefore they may affect the propagation properties of magnetic waves .",
    "this suggests a coupling between longitudinal , compressible waves ( leading to density perturbations ) and transversal magnetic waves propagating with a velocity which depends on the density .",
    "the later can be associated with alfvn waves which are transversal and represent the purely electromagnetic properties of the medium .",
    "the compressible waves cause a periodical variation of the density and so of the alfvn speed , and may lead to the effective energy transmission into certain harmonics of alfvn waves .",
    "the swing coupling between sound and alfvn waves propagating along an applied magnetic field [ 16 - 17 ] is a good example of this phenomenon . on the other hand , magnetosonic waves propagating at an angle to the magnetic field",
    "also cause periodical variations of the alfvn speed and may lead to similar phenomena .",
    "it is worth noticing that , contrary to the alfvn waves , the magnetosonic waves can be easily excited in a medium by any force ( even of non electromagnetic origin ) .",
    "therefore , the coupling between magnetosonic and alfvn waves allows the transmission of energy into purely transversal magnetic oscillations through compressible magnetosonic oscillations .    to show the mathematical formalism of swing wave interaction we consider the case of magnetosonic wave propagation across the applied magnetic field . in this case",
    "we have fast magnetosonic waves .",
    "for simplicity we consider a rectangular geometry , which then can be generalised to cylindrical and spherical symmetries .",
    "consider motions of a homogeneous medium , with zero viscosity and infinite conductivity , as described by the ideal mhd equations : @xmath33 @xmath34 + { { ( { { \\bf b}{\\cdot}{\\nabla}}){\\bf b}}\\over { 4{\\pi}}},\\ ] ] @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fluid velocity .",
    "we consider adiabatic processes , so the pressure @xmath2 and density @xmath32 are connected by the relation @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the unperturbed uniform pressure and density and @xmath40 is the ratio of specific heats .",
    "we neglect gravity , though it may be of importance under some astrophysical conditions .",
    "the unperturbed magnetic field @xmath41 is directed along the @xmath42 axis.the system is bounded in the @xmath11 direction ( @xmath43 is the size of the system ) .",
    "standing fast magnetosonic waves are polarized in the @xmath11 direction , while alfvn waves are polarized along the @xmath44 axis and propagate along the @xmath42 axis.,width=264 ]    linear analysis of equations ( 4)-(7 ) show the existence of three kinds of mhd waves : alfvn and magnetosonic ( fast and slow ) waves .",
    "the difference between these waves is that the restoring force of alfvn waves is the tension of magnetic field lines , @xmath45 , acting alone , while the restoring force of magnetosonic waves is mainly the gradient of ordinary and magnetic pressures , @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "the various waves can be distinguished by their different speeds and polarizations .",
    "the linear evolution of the waves in a homogeneous medium is governed by the usual linear wave equations .",
    "consider a uniform , unperturbed , magnetic field @xmath47 directed along the @xmath42-axis , and the case of magnetosonic wave propagation across the field in the @xmath11 direction ( see fig .",
    "then there are only fast magnetosonic waves ( the slow wave is absent ) which in the linear approximation is described by the equations : @xmath48 @xmath49,\\ ] ] @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the perturbations of magnetic field and velocity , respectively , and @xmath53 is the sound speed . here and afterwards",
    "@xmath32 denotes the perturbation of density ( in equations ( 4)-(5 ) @xmath32 was the total density ) . the wave equation for linear",
    "fast magnetosonic waves then follows , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the phase velocity of fast waves and @xmath56 is the alfvn speed",
    ".    the solution of the wave equation can be either propagating or standing patterns .",
    "the boundedness of the medium leads to the formation of a discrete spectrum of harmonics which represent the normal modes ( eigenmodes ) of the system .",
    "we consider the standing fast magnetosonic waves , which have a straightforward extention to cylindrical ( pulsating magnetic tube ) and spherical ( pulsating sphere with dipole - like magnetic field ) geometries .",
    "the solutions for standing ( plane ) fast magnetosonic waves are : @xmath57 where @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is the eigenvalue for a system of size @xmath43 in the @xmath11 direction , @xmath60 is the corresponding eigenfrequency , and @xmath61 is the relative amplitude of the waves .",
    "eigenvalues and eigenfrequencies are related by the dispersion relation @xmath62 .",
    "it is seen from the expressions ( 12 ) that standing fast magnetosonic waves cause a local periodical variation in both the density and the magnetic field .",
    "this variation is maximal near the nodes of the velocity and approaches to zero near the antinodes .",
    "the amplitude of the variation is considered to be small @xmath63 , and so does not affect the fast magnetosonic wave itself .",
    "consider now the influence of the density and the magnetic field variations ( 12 ) on alfvn waves , considered to be polarised in the @xmath64 plane .",
    "then the velocity fields of fast magnetosonic and alfvn waves are decoupled .",
    "the linear equations for alfvn waves are : @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are small perturbations of the magnetic field and the velocity .",
    "these equations lead to the wave equation @xmath69    the influence of the fast magnetosonic waves can be expressed by modifying equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) , which now became @xmath70 @xmath71 here we have neglected the advective terms @xmath72 and @xmath73 for several reasons . at the initial stage , the perturbations @xmath67 and @xmath68 of alfvn waves propagating along the @xmath42 axis do not depend on the @xmath11 coordinate ; each magnetic surface across @xmath11 evolves independently .",
    "the @xmath11 dependence arises due to the action of the fast magnetosonic waves , and so the neglected terms are second order in @xmath74 .",
    "moreover we can consider the alfvn waves at the velocity node of standing fast magnetosonic waves , where these terms are zero . in principle",
    ", the coordinate @xmath11 stands as a parameter in equations ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) of alfvn waves .",
    "equations ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) lead to the hill type second order differential equation @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the time derivative of the perturbing field . introducing @xmath78 and neglecting terms of order",
    "@xmath74 leads to the equation @xmath79 { { \\partial^2 h_y}\\over { \\partial z^2}}=0.\\ ] ] comparing equations ( 20 ) and ( 15 ) we can see that the influence of standing fast magnetosonic waves is expressed through a periodical variation of the alfvn speed .    performing a fourier transform of @xmath80 with @xmath81 , equation ( 20 ) leads to mathieu s equation @xcite @xmath82{\\hat h_y}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath83 with @xmath11 playing the role of a parameter .",
    "equation ( 21 ) has main resonant solution if @xmath84 and it can be expressed as @xmath85,\\ ] ] where @xmath86 .",
    "the solution has a resonant character within the frequency interval @xmath87    equation ( 24 ) shows that the harmonics of alfvn waves with half the frequency of fast magnetosonic waves grow exponentially in time .",
    "the growth rate of alfvn waves is maximal at the velocity nodes of fast magnetosonic waves and tends to zero at the antinodes ( see equations ( 12 ) and ( 22 ) ) .",
    "the amplitude of the magnetic field component in alfvn waves depends on the @xmath11 coordinate , i.e. there is the periodical magnetic pressure gradient along this direction .",
    "energy conservation implies that this gradient leads to the damping of initial fast magnetosonic waves , i.e. the energy transformed into alfvn waves is extracted from fast magnetosonic waves . to show this",
    ", we consider the backreaction of amplified alfvn waves on the initial fast magnetosonic waves .",
    "the dependence of @xmath67 on the @xmath11 coordinate leads to an additional term in the equation of motion ( 9 ) for fast waves , @xmath49 - { { \\partial}\\over { \\partial x}}\\left [ { { b_y^2}\\over { 8{\\pi}}}\\right ] .\\ ] ] therefore the wave equation ( 11 ) now becomes @xmath88.\\ ] ] the additional term has the frequency of the initial fast magnetosonic waves @xmath60 ( within the order of @xmath74 ) and can be considered as the external , periodic force . at the initial stage",
    "it can be neglected as of second order of smallness .",
    "however , it becomes significant because of the exponential growth of amplitudes ( see equation ( 24 ) ) .",
    "it oscillates out of phase with respect to the initial fast waves ( 12 ) , thus leading to their damping ( as expected from physical considerations ) .",
    "note that equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) describing the pendulum oscillations are similar to equations ( 20 ) and ( 27 ) describing alfvn waves and fast magnetosonic waves ; the longitudinal oscillations of the pendulum correspond to the fast magnetosonic waves and the transversal oscillations correspond to the alfvn waves .",
    "swing coupling between fast magnetosonic and alfvn waves may be generalised from rectangular geometry to other symmetries , though a detailed description is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the suggested mechanism of energy transformation from fast magnetosonic into alfvn waves has important consequences .",
    "it can be noted that the alfvn waves hardly undergo either excitation or damping processes , while magnetosonic waves can be easily excited by external , even nonelectromagnetic , forces .",
    "then swing interaction leads to the intriguing but natural suggestion that the energy of the nonelectromagnetic force which supports the magnetosonic waves in the system can be transmitted into the energy of purely magnetic incompressible oscillations .",
    "this result has many astrophysical applications .",
    "we briefly describe several of them .",
    "resonant interaction between mhd waves , due to the inhomogeneity of the medium , was proposed by ionson [ 8 ] .",
    "it arises where the frequency of an incoming wave matches the local frequency of the medium .",
    "then a resonant energy transformation may take place , known as resonant absorption .",
    "similar phenomenon may arise also due to swing wave interaction . in this case fast magnetosonic waves can transform their energy into alfvn waves , even in a homogeneous medium . for given medium parameters ( magnetic field , density )",
    "the energy of fast waves may be absorbed by harmonics with wavelengths satisfying the resonant condition ( 23 ) .",
    "consequently , fast magnetosonic waves can transmit their energy into alfvn waves in any spatial distribution of density or magnetic field .",
    "the process can be called _ swing absorption_. the particular point of _ swing absorption _ is that energy absorption occurs through the harmonics with half the frequency of incoming waves ( see equation ( 23 ) ) .",
    "the process may be of importance in the earth s magnetosphere and in the solar atmosphere .      swing wave interaction may play an important role in the excitation of torsional alfvn waves in solar coronal loops .",
    "it may be suggested that any external action on the magnetic tube , anchored in the highly dynamical photosphere , causes a radial pulsation at the fundamental frequency , like a tuning fork ( see also @xcite ) . for a tube of radius @xmath89",
    "the fundamental frequency of pulsation will be of order @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the phase velocity of fast magnetosonic waves at the photospheric level .",
    "if we consider the alfvn and sound speeds to be of order @xmath92 kms@xmath93 and the radius of order @xmath94 km , then the period of fundamental mode of pulsation will be a few tens of seconds .",
    "radial pulsations of the tube may lead to the resonant ( exponential ) amplification of torsional alfvn waves with half the frequency of the pulsations .",
    "these high frequency torsional alfvn waves can propagate upward and carry energy from the photosphere into the magnetically controlled corona or they may be damped in chromospheric regions leading to the heating of the chromospheric magnetic network .",
    "swing wave interaction may be of importance in stellar interiors . a radial pulsation of a spherically symmetric star with dipole - like magnetic field may lead to the amplification of torsional oscillations .",
    "there are a number of energy sources which can support pulsations : radiation , nuclear reactions , tidal forces in binary stars , convection , etc .",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "then the transformation of pulsational energy into torsional oscillations may lead to new sources for stellar magnetic activity .",
    "the swing wave - wave interaction @xcite is developed here in the case of fast magnetosonic waves propagating across a magnetic field and alfvn waves propagating along the field . in the case of oblique propagation ,",
    "slow magnetosonic waves also exist and they may transmit their energy into alfvn waves . in some cases",
    "the coupling between slow magnetosonic and alfvn waves may be of importance .",
    "also , the coupling in the case of different geometries ( cylindrical , spherical ) may be important in astrophysical situations .",
    "the most important result of swing wave interaction is that it reveals a new energy channel for alfvn waves , permitting the transformation of energy of nonelectromagnetic origin into the energy of electromagnetic oscillations ."
