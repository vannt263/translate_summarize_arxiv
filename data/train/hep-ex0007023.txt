    "semi - inclusive processes in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) are of importance because they can be used to test the perturbative quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) description of hadron production via parton fragmentation .",
    "an observable of particular interest is the distribution of the azimuthal angle , @xmath0 ( measured in the hadronic centre - of - mass frame , hcm ) between the lepton scattering plane , defined by the incoming and outgoing lepton momenta , and the hadron production plane , defined by the exchanged virtual boson and an outgoing hadron .",
    "asymmetries in the @xmath1 distribution , i.e. terms proportional to @xmath2 and @xmath3 arise whenever a non - zero transverse momentum , in the hcm frame , is present in the scattering process .",
    "consequently both non - perturbative and perturbative qcd effects  @xcite give rise to these asymmetries .",
    "the azimuthal dependence of parton production has the form    @xmath4    this form results from the polarisation of the exchanged virtual boson .",
    "the coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 depend on the helicities of the final - state parton(s ) , partonic transverse momenta and on colour coherence  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 term is expected from interference of amplitudes arising from the @xmath7 and @xmath8 helicity components of the transversely - polarised part of the exchanged boson , whereas transverse / longitudinal interference gives rise to the @xmath9 term .",
    "terms in @xmath10 and @xmath11 are not expected for neutral current reactions .",
    "the asymmetry that results from the intrinsic momentum of a quark in the proton is referred to as the non - perturbative asymmetry .",
    "since the intrinsic momentum is small , this asymmetry should fall rapidly with increasing transverse momentum of the measured hadron and with increasing @xmath12  @xcite , where @xmath13 is the negative square of the four - momentum of the virtual exchanged boson .",
    "in particular , the term @xmath6 is small at high @xmath14 the transverse momenta arising from the fragmentation itself does not contribute to the asymmetry but only smears the observed distribution  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the asymmetry associated with leading - order terms in perturbative qcd calculations , the perturbative asymmetry , is weakly dependent on @xmath12 and persists at high transverse momenta .",
    "the perturbative qcd contribution to terms @xmath5 and @xmath6 is large at leading order ( lo ) in @xmath15 the @xmath16 term can be unambiguously attributed to perturbative qcd processes in the high @xmath12 region under investigation .",
    "the event kinematics of dis are determined by @xmath12 , and one of the two bjorken scaling variables @xmath17 or @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the four - momentum of the incoming proton and @xmath20 is the positron - proton centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the kinematic region studied is @xmath21 and @xmath22 corresponding to a @xmath12 range @xmath23    the form of eq .",
    "[ eq : azi ] is expected to be maintained for single particle production  @xcite , since high - momentum hadrons are produced close to the direction of the parton .",
    "note that in order to observe the @xmath2 asymmetry , a selection procedure is required which consistently associates leading hadrons produced from either quarks or gluons  @xcite . since the gluon fragmentation function is ` softer ' than that of the quarks , the hadron - quark correlation can be enhanced by selecting ` leading ' charged particles .",
    "this was accomplished by cutting on the lorentz - invariant variable @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the track or particle four - vector .",
    "figure  [ fig : phidist ] shows the differential @xmath1 distributions of charged hadrons for four values of their minimum transverse momentum , @xmath26 in the hcm .",
    "the results obtained from the main analysis method  @xcite ( full line ) and a bin - by - bin correction method ( points ) are seen to agree . at low @xmath26 a clear @xmath27 term is observed . as the value of @xmath28",
    "is increased a @xmath16 term becomes evident .",
    "figure  [ fig : mc_lo ] shows the moments @xmath29 and @xmath30 as a function of @xmath31 the @xmath10 term is consistent with zero independent of the value chosen for @xmath26 in agreement with expectation .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is negative and decreases in magnitude as @xmath28 is increased .",
    "in contrast , the value of @xmath30 is positive and rises as @xmath28 is increased .",
    "figure  [ fig : mc_lo ] also compares the data with two lo qcd calculations .",
    "both calculations were made with @xmath32 as the appropriate scale , with the binnewies et al .",
    "lo fragmentation function  @xcite and with the cteq4 lo proton parton densities  @xcite .",
    "the calculation from zeus ( based on the calculation of chay et al .",
    "@xcite ) includes an estimation of the non - perturbative contribution , from intrinsic @xmath33 and hadronisation @xmath34 and integrates over the whole kinematic range .",
    "the results of ahmed  & gehrmann are purely at leading order in @xmath35 and are evaluated at the mean values @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the data",
    ". the different implementations account for the observed difference in the two predictions ; using @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the zeus perturbative calculation leads to agreement with the ahmed  & gehrmann calculation .",
    "the azimuthal asymmetries in the deep inelastic electroproduction of single particles have been measured at hera in the hcm . for hadrons produced at large transverse momenta ,",
    "the measured value for @xmath40 is negative and is in agreement with qcd predictions .",
    "the moment @xmath30 has been measured here for the first time and is non - zero and positive .",
    "it increases as a function of the minimum particle transverse momentum , as expected from qcd . since the non - perturbative contribution to @xmath41",
    "is predicted to be negligible , this measurement provides clear evidence for a perturbative qcd contribution to the azimuthal asymmetry ."
