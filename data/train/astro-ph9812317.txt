    "galaxies that emit the bulk of their luminosity in the far - infrared ( hereafter far - ir galaxies ) are an energetically significant component of the local universe ( e.g soifer et al 1987 ; sanders & mirabel 1997 ) .",
    "they are also the only local systems ( apart from qsos ) that have bolometric luminosities similar to typical high - redshift galaxies selected by uv ( steidel et al 1996 ; meurer , heckman , & calzetti 1998 ) or sub - millimeter ( e.g. hughes et al 1998 ; blain et al 1998 ) techniques . as such , they offer unique laboratories to study the physical processes that were important in the formation and early evolution of galaxies ( heckman 1998 ) .",
    "one of their most interesting attributes are their galactic - scale and highly luminous gaseous emission - line nebulae ( cf .",
    "armus , heckman , & miley 1990 ; veilleux et al .",
    "in several well - known cases like m 82 and ngc 253 , hot x - ray emitting gas has also been discovered , and this gas shows a clear morphological relationship to the optical emission - line nebula ( cf .",
    "dahlem , weaver , & heckman 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "it seems clear in these cases that the x - ray nebulae are energized by the mechanical energy of an outflow driven by the multiple supernovae in the starburst ( a ` superwind '  cf .",
    "heckman , lehnert , & armus 1993 ; bland - hawthorn 1995 ) .",
    "it would be important to establish the ubiquity of the superwind phenomenon in far - ir galaxies , since such outflows could play an important role in heating and chemically - enriching galactic halos and the inter - galactic medium ( cf .",
    "heckman , armus , & miley 1990 ; gibson , loewensten , & mushotzky 1997 ) .",
    "the x - ray nebulae studied in detail and at high spatial resolution to date have been mostly associated with far - ir galaxies of modest luminosity ( @xmath15 few @xmath16 ) .",
    "the situation may be different and more complex for more powerful far - ir galaxies .",
    "these systems are also primarily powered by intense starbursts ( genzel et al 1998 ) although deeply - buried agn are energetically significant in some cases and may dominate the systems with the highest bolometric luminosities ( cf . sanders & mirabel 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "they are created in the aftermath of a galactic collision or merger ( cf . mihos & hernquist 1994 ) , so that the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the colliding interstellar media may be energetically significant ( harwit et al .",
    "it is also particularly interesting to study the effects of possible superwinds on the interstellar media of merging disk galaxies in general , since such hydrodynamical processes may be important in the subsequent transformation of the merger product into an elliptical galaxy ( e.g. schweizer 1992 ) .",
    "we have therefore undertaken an analysis of x - ray and optical data for a small sample of some of the nearest and brightest powerful infrared galaxies ( l@xmath17 @xmath18 10@xmath19 erg s@xmath2 ) in order to determine the characteristics of their nebulae and thereby determine the nature of their energy sources .",
    "heckman et al .  ( 1996 ) presented x - ray and optical data on the prototypical ` ultraluminous ' far - ir galaxy arp 220 , and showed that this galaxy appears to have an outflow that is qualitatively similar to ( but more powerful than ) the outflows seen in m 82 and ngc 253 . in wang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we reported the results for the case of mrk 266 , and here we discuss a third example .",
    "iwasawa & comastri ( 1998 ) have recently reported on the x - ray properties of the ir - bright merger system ngc 6240 .",
    "our approach is complementary to the recent work by read & ponman ( 1998 ) , who have systematically studied the x - ray properties of an optically- selected sample of merging galaxies using _ rosat _  data .",
    "the members of their sample are not in general powerful starbursts , and only arp 220 meets the above far - ir luminosity criterion .",
    "the powerful far - ir system arp 299 ( also known as ngc 3690 and mrk 171 ) consists of two overlapping galaxies that appear to be in the late stages of a merger . to the northwest of the merging galaxy pair , while ngc 3690 properly refers to the merging pair . to avoid further confusion",
    ", we will adopt the name arp 299 to refer to the system rather than ngc 3690 . ]",
    "= 75 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "this implies a scale of 1= 0.21 kpc and 1= 13 kpc . ]",
    "it has one of the brightest , most luminous , and largest emission - line nebulae in the extensive h@xmath10 imaging survey of far - ir galaxies by ahm90 .",
    "as we will describe in this paper , this material is immersed in and surrounded by a large and bright region of soft x - ray emission .",
    "arp 299 is therefore a prime target for a detailed examination of the relationship between the warm and hot gaseous components in powerful far infrared galaxies .",
    "arp 299 has been extensively studied following the landmark paper of gerhz , sramek , & weedman ( 1983 ) : in the x - ray ( zezas , georgantopoulos , & ward 1998 - hereafter zgw ) , uv ( meurer et al 1995 ) , optical ( friedman et al 1987 ) , ir ( fischer et al 1983 ; telesco , decher , & gatley 1985 ; beck et al 1986 ; nakagawa et al 1989 ; joy et al 1989 ; wynn - williams et al 1991 ) , and radio ( condon 1991 ; lonsdale , lonsdale , & smith 1992 ; smith , lonsdale , & lonsdale 1998 ) wavebands , and in hi ( stanford & wood 1989 ; hibbard 1997 ) , oh ( baan & haschick 1990 ) , co ( aalto et al 1997 ; sargent & scoville 1991 ) , and hcn ( aalto et al 1997 ) .",
    "it has been the site of several recent supernovae ( sn1992bu - iau circular 5960 ; sn1993 g - iau circular 5718 ; sn1998 t - iau circular 6859 ; and a possible radio supernova described in iau circular 4988 ) .",
    "arp 299 has a bolometric luminosity of approximately 6 @xmath11 10@xmath20 l@xmath21 , which is dominated by far - ir emission .",
    "@xmath22 spectroscopy ( genzel et al . 1998 ) shows that even in the mid / far - ir there is no sign of a substantial contribution to the energetics of arp 299 by a dust - buried agn . as we will report below",
    ", this is also true in the hard x - ray band probed by @xmath23 .",
    "thus , arp 299 s impressive luminosity seems to be provided largely or entirely by stars .",
    "the centers of the two merging galaxies in arp 299 are separated by only about 22(4.5 kpc in projection ) , with a clear overlap in the disks . following the nomenclature of gerhz , sramek , & weedman ( 1983 ) , the compact site of activity in the central region of the eastern galaxy",
    "is denoted ` a ' , while the activity in the western galaxy breaks up into a complex of sources ( a double source ",
    "b1 \" , and  b2 \" the first of which is evidently associated with the nucleus of the galaxy , and a third source  c \" roughly 8or 1.6 kpc nnw of b1 ) .    in the present paper we present an analysis of both x - ray and optical imaging and spectroscopy of arp 299 .",
    "our approach complements that of zgw , who analyzed the pspc spectrum , but not the morphological structure of the _ rosat _  data . our data analysis is described in  2 and",
    "the results for x - ray and optical data are presented in  3 and  4 respectively .",
    "we will discuss and interpret these results in  5 in an attempt to determine how the bright optical / x - ray nebula is heated and how arp 299 and its nebula may fit in to the general class of powerful far - ir galaxies . in  6 we will summarize our conclusions .",
    "arp 299 has been observed in the soft and medium - energy x - ray bands with the rontgensatellit ( _ rosat _ ) and the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( _ asca _ ; tanaka , inoue & holt 1994 ) .",
    "_ rosat _  contains the high - resolution soft x - ray imaging detector ( hri ) and the positional sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) , while _ asca _  contains two sets of detectors which are the solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ; designated here as s0 and s1 ) and the gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ; designated s2 and s3 ) .",
    "the data from the two satellites are complementary . for soft x - rays ( @xmath24 kev ) ,",
    "_ rosat _  provides @xmath25 spatial resolution with the hri and moderate spectral resolution with the pspc .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "instruments extend the spectral coverage to 10 kev with a factor of ten better spectral resolution ( albeit with poor spatial resolution ) .",
    "the x - ray data were obtained by us ( _ rosat _ ) and from the heasarc operated by the lhea at the goddard space flight center ( _ asca _ ) .",
    "the _ rosat _  hri observations occured on april @xmath26 1992 for a total live time integration of 6691 seconds .",
    "the nominal pointing center of the hri was 11h:25m:42.8s , @xmath2758d:50m:15s , which places the center of the hri field of view at a position approximately halfway between the interacting galaxies that comprise arp 299 .",
    "the hri background is approximately constant over the field of view and so we subtract a constant offset , which is determined by averaging the background at different source - free locations .",
    "after background subtraction , there are 285 counts in the hri image , corresponding to a count rate of 0.0426 cnt s@xmath2 from arp 299 . for imaging analysis",
    ", the data were binned and smoothed with a gaussian having @xmath28 , yielding an effective resolution of @xmath29 fwhm .",
    "arp 299 was observed with the pspc in multiple intervals from 1991 november 19 to 1993 april 23 for 9,925 net seconds .",
    "times of a high master veto rate ( mvr above @xmath5220 ) indicating charged particle contamination were negligible , and so we include all of the on - source data in our analysis . after correcting for vignetting and subtracting background , the pspc count rate for arp 299 is 0.10 counts s@xmath2 , yielding 983 counts .",

    "the first data set provides few source counts and so we examine only the data from the second observation . to remove times of high background , we selected data within time ranges defined by the following criteria : for the sis , the satellite was required to be outside the saa with an earth elevation angle greater than 10@xmath32 and a geomagnetic cutoff rigidity ( cor ) greater than 6 gev c@xmath2 . in addition , we removed times less than 16 s after an saa passage , 60 s after a day - to - night passage , and during times of bright earth when the elevation angle was less than 20@xmath32 . for the gis",
    ", the satellite was required to be outside the saa with an earth elevation angle greater than 5@xmath32 and a geomagnetic cutoff rigidity ( cor ) greater than 6 gev c@xmath2 .",
    "two background spikes were also removed .",
    "remaining on - source times were 26.3 ks ( s0 ) , 28.3 ks ( s1 ) and 36.2 ks ( g2 and g3 ) . the background during the observation ranged from 20 to 30% of the total count rate from @xmath33 kev .",
    "source spectra were extracted by selecting circular regions of @xmath34 radius and background was selected from near the source in the gis and from the same chip in the sis .",
    "the background - subtracted count rates are 0.042 , 0.039 , 0.023 , and 0.033 counts s@xmath2 , for s0 , s1 , s2 , and s3 , respectively ( totalling 4,234 source counts ) .    to extract _ rosat_images and spectra we use the iraf / pros v2.3.1 data reduction package . for _ asca",
    "_ we use ftools v4.0 . with the exception of the spatially - resolved halo emission in the pspc ,",
    "all spectra are grouped to have @xmath35 counts per bin to allow the use of @xmath36 statistics .",
    "there are too few counts in the halo to assume a gaussian probability distribution and so poisson errors and the c - statistic ( cash 1979 ) are used for spectral modeling .",
    "optical spectra of the arp 299 system were obtained in may 1987 and january 1988 using the kpno 4-meter mayall telescope in combination with the rc spectrograph and a ti2 ccd . the may 1987 data ( hereafter may87 )",
    "are of medium spectral resolution ( 3.6@xmath37 full width half maximum - fwhm ) and cover the wavelength range of 6000 - 7000 @xmath37 .",
    "three slits ( 2.0@xmath38 ) were placed at a position angle ( pa ) of 90@xmath39 along the arp 299 system .",
    "two of these slits intercept components `` c `` and `` b``1 respectively ( in the notation of gehrz , sramek , & weedman 1983 ) .",
    "the third slit was placed to be parallel to the first two , but displaced 24@xmath40 north of component ' ' c '' . the january 1988 data ( hereafter jan88 )",
    "are of low resolution ( 13.5@xmath37 fwhm ) and cover the wavelength range of 4200 - 7000@xmath37 .",
    "the slit dimensions were the same as those used for the may87 data . , but here the slits were placed to intercept component ' ' a '' ( at a pa=90@xmath39 ) and to pass along the tail of emission to the northwest of arp 299 ( at a pa=120@xmath39 ) . both the may87 and the jan88 data were binned by a factor of 2.0 in the spatial direction to achieve a pixel scale of 0.89@xmath40 pixel @xmath2 .    the may87 and jan88 spectra were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded using the noao s iraf software .",
    "the longslit package was used for wavelength calibration and distortion correction of the raw spectra . only the low resolution spectra ( jan88 ) were taken under photometric conditions , and these were flux - calibrated in iraf using kpno iids standard stars .",
    "for each extracted spectrum , the splot package was used to measure the integrated line fluxes , central wavelengths , linewidths , equivalent widths and continuum levels .",
    "the h@xmath41[nii ] complex was deblended in the data by requiring the widths of the lines to be the same .",
    "the [ sii ] lines at 6717  and 6731  were required to have the same linewidth and , in regions of low signal to noise , to have a fixed wavelength separation of 14.6 . in all cases , the uncertainties in the line",
    "fits were estimated as a function of signal - to - noise ratio by comparing the measured value of the [ nii]@xmath42 6584/6548  flux ratio to that of the value of 3.0 expected from atomic physics .",
    "the background - subtracted @xmath43 kev pspc image of arp 299 is shown superimposed on the palomar sky survey image in figure 1 .",
    "accurate astrometry is not possible for the pspc because no independent x - ray point sources are present in the field of view , and so the image is aligned with the optical centroid of the arp 299 system to within the accuracy of the _ rosat _  pointing uncertainties ( @xmath44 ) .    in order to investigate the morphology of the x - ray image as a function of energy , we constructed `` soft '' band ( @xmath45 kev ) and `` hard '' band ( @xmath46 kev ) images .",
    "photons were selected from the appropriate pulse invariant ( pi ) channels and the central @xmath47 by @xmath47 regions were extracted from the original unbinned x - ray map ( @xmath48 pixels ) .",
    "these images were then smoothed with a gaussian function with @xmath49 pixels ( @xmath50 fwhm ) . after smoothing ,",
    "the images were shifted slightly to align the center of the hard _ rosat _   image ( which represents the core of x - ray emission from the galaxy ) with the center of emission mapped with the hri ( see below ) .",
    "the pspc images , shown in figure 2 , reveal that the hard and soft x - ray isophotes are elongated in nearly orthogonal directions .",
    "the hard x - ray image is more compact , possibly oriented in the east - west direction ( no doubt resulting from the complex of point sources seen in the hri data ) .",
    "the soft x - ray isophotes on the other hand , are clearly oriented in the nne / ssw direction , and are extended on a scale of @xmath51 , or 45 kpc .",
    "the size of the soft x - ray emission is similar to that of the hi mapped by stanford & wood ( 1989 ) , but the x - ray emission is roughly perpendicular to the nw / se orientation of the hi .",
    "the shapes of the soft - band and hard - band images imply at least two distinct emission regions .      the hri image ( fig .",
    "3 ) has a total background - subtracted count rate of 0.0426 cnts s@xmath2 , and shows a complex , clearly resolved structure extended over more than an arcminute in a predominantly east - west direction .",
    "this is the direction of the two galaxies in the interacting system .",
    "there are numerous local maxima in the x - ray image , but the brightest source to the east is only @xmath52 north of the non - thermal radio and near - infrared nucleus of the eastern galaxy ( gehrz , sramek & weedman 1983 ; condon 1991 ; wynn - williams , et al .",
    "this is nucleus `` a '' in the nomenclature of gehrz , sramek & weedman ( 1983 ) .",
    "given the pointing accuracy of the _ rosat _ and the fact that nucleus a is the single primary peak in both the radio and near infrared data , we hereafter identify the eastern x - ray peak with nucleus a. the western x - ray peak is extended in a `` ridge '' of emission with two prominent knots separated by 4 to 5 @xmath40 . when the eastern peak is aligned with nucleus  a \" , the southeast knot in the ridge is coincident with component  b1 \" and the northwest knot appears to be associated with a bright knot of h@xmath10 emission a few @xmath40 to the west of component  b2 \" .",
    "note that while b1 is the peak in the 2.2 micron , 10 micron , and radio emission in the western galaxy , ",
    "b2 \" is the optical continuum peak .",
    "finally , the infrared and radio peak known as component  c \" is not located at the position of a relative peak in the _ rosat _  hri image ( a weak x - ray source tabulated by zgw is located about 5@xmath40 to the nw of c ) .",
    "thus , although component ",
    "c \" is a source of optical , near - infrared and radio emission , it does not appear to be a strong source of x - rays .",
    "we can estimate the contribution of point sources to the total number of counts in the hri image by summing the flux from the three strongest point sources within 5@xmath40 square apertures ( a `` detection cell '' that includes 50% of the total flux expected from a point source ) .",
    "these three x - ray sources are equally bright ( to within @xmath5310% ) and together account for approximately 21% of the total counts in the hri image , after correction for the 50% of the flux beyond the 5@xmath40 detection cells ( 0.0087 counts s@xmath2 ) .",
    "although the hri data do not provide much spectral information , we can estimate their fluxes and luminosities over @xmath43 kev range by assuming a simple spectral model ( david et al 1997 ) .",
    "if the point sources are modelled as a mekal plasma with kt @xmath54 0.8 kev ( see  3.2.2 ) and line of sight neutral hi column of n@xmath55 @xmath56 ( n@xmath57 @xmath56 ) , they have a combined unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of about @xmath58 erg s@xmath2 ( @xmath59 erg s@xmath2 ) from @xmath43 kev . alternatively , if the point sources are modelled as having power law spectral shapes with a photon index of 1.6 ( the index of the hard x - ray component - see  3.2.3 ) they have a combined x - ray luminosity of @xmath60 erg s@xmath2 ( 3.1@xmath61 erg s@xmath2 ) from @xmath43 kev .",
    "each of the three sources thus has a luminosity in the 0.1 to 2.4 kev band of @xmath5 few @xmath62 to 10@xmath63 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "this can be compared to the most powerful individual x - ray sources known in nearby galaxies , which have peak x - ray luminosities of @xmath5 10@xmath64 erg s@xmath2 : sn1978c in ngc 1313 ( ryder et al 1993 ) , sn1986j in ngc 891 ( bregman & pildis 1992 ) , sn 1993j in m 81 ( zimmermann et al 1994 ; kohmura et al 1994 ) , and the highly variable sources in the nuclei of m 82 ( collura et al 1994 ) and ngc 3628 ( dahlem , heckman , & fabbiano 1995 ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that at the distance of arp 299 , 5@xmath40 corresponds to roughly 1 kpc , and that the sources are coincident with the sites of the most intense star - formation in arp 299 .",
    "higher resolution x - ray imaging with axaf may well resolve these sources into multiple sub - components .",
    "the different morphologies of the hard and soft - band pspc images suggest that there are at least two sources of x - rays in the arp 299 system with different spectral shapes and possibly different emission mechanisms . to uncover these emission mechanisms",
    "we extract spatially - resolved spectra from the central and outer regions .",
    "the central or `` core '' region is defined with a circle of diameter = 1.3@xmath65 centered on the x - ray peak of fig .",
    "2a . the outer or `` halo '' region",
    "is defined with an ellipse having a major axis = 2.78@xmath65 , minor axis = 2.22@xmath65 , and p.a . @xmath66",
    "centered on the x - ray peak of figure 2a .",
    "background is taken from source - free regions near the galaxy .",
    "the extraction regions , source counts and count rates are listed in table 1 and the spatially - resolved halo and core spectra are shown in figure 4 .",
    "there are 328 counts from within the halo region , 119 of which are source counts and 209 ( almost 2/3 ) of which are background counts .",
    "we estimate the contribution of background counts to the total spectrum by calculating the areas of the halo and background regions and then using the ratio of areas to predict the contribution of background in the halo region .",
    "we then determine an empirical spectral model for the background and include this model ( properly normalized ) in our spectral fits to `` subtract '' the background contribution .",
    "our empirical background model consists of a power law with @xmath67 = 2.3 @xmath530.2 and an unresolved gaussian - shaped emission line at 0.53 kev .",
    "the line represents oxygen fluorescence from earth s atmosphere and the power law approximates contributions from the particle background and diffuse x - ray background , as well as long - term and short - term enhancements in the background rate .",
    "the statistics are too poor to distinguish between different physical models for the halo emission .",
    "in particular , the data can not distinguish between the two most natural choices , which are a power - law spectrum ( where the x - rays are produced by inverse - compton scattering of lower energy photons ) and a thermal spectrum ( where the x - rays are produced in a plasma that has been heated by shocks ) .",
    "a power - law spectrum is expected if the soft x - rays result from emission associated with an extended synchrotron - emitting radio halo , such as that found around m82 ( seaquist & odegard 1991 ) .",
    "however , the radio emission in arp 299 is not extended on the same scale as the soft x - rays ( condon et al .",
    "in fact , the soft x - ray emission is extended in a direction ( north - south ) that is roughly perdendicular to the radio source major axis .",
    "this implies that the x - ray emission is not related to the emission at radio wavelengths in arp 299 , and hence a power - law description of the halo is unlikely .",
    "recent studies of extended emission in starburst galaxies indicate that the soft emission is primarily thermal ( see dahlem , weaver & heckman 1998 ) and so we choose a model that consists of an emission spectrum from hot , diffuse gas based on calculations by mewe and kaastra with fe l calculations by liedahl ( mewe , gronenschild & van den oord 1985 ; mewe , lemen & van den oord 1986 ; kaastra 1992 - hereafter referred to as the mekal model ) .    when the data are fitted with a single temperature mekal model and solar abundances",
    "are assumed , we find no evidence for absorption in excess of the galactic column density ( 0.9@xmath1110@xmath68 @xmath56 ; burstein & heiles 1982 ) , and the spectrum is well described with a plasma having kt@xmath69 kev ( table 2 ) .",
    "the @xmath43 kev unabsorbed flux for this model is @xmath70 ergs @xmath56 s@xmath2 , corresponding to a halo luminosity of @xmath71 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "for the core spectrum , a single - component power - law model yields a poor fit ( table 2 ; model a ) and results in positive residuals near 0.9 kev that resemble a blend of primarily fe l and ne line emission ( figure 5a ) .",
    "mekal plasma models with solar abundances also yield poor fits ( table 2 ; models b1 and b2 ) , even when the absorbing column density is a free parameter in the fit .",
    "this can be seen in figure 5b , which shows evidence for excess flux toward higher energies .",
    "if the abundance is allowed to vary , the fit improves ( table 2 ; model b3 ) implying an abundance of 0.12(+0.10 -0.06)@xmath72 .",
    "such a low abundance seems highly unusual , especially in light of the intense starburst in arp 299 , but since abundance calculations are derived from line equivalent widths , the possibility exists that a second thermal or hard x - ray component ( not uniquely detectable with the pspc ) may contribute continuum flux at low energies .",
    "such a component would dilute the line emission from the plasma and cause the abundance of the hot gas to be underestimated .",
    "this behavior is typical of starburst spectra that intrinsically contain multiple emission components but are fitted with single - component plasma models ( dahlem , weaver , & heckman 1998 ; weaver , heckman , & dahlem 1998 ) .",
    "for the remainder of this paper we therefore assume that the x - ray emitting gas has solar abundance .    for the case of solar abundances ,",
    "the pspc data require at least two spectral components .",
    "models that consists of a medium - temperature mekal plasma and a thermal bremsstrahlung with kt = 7.0 kev ( table 2 ; model c ) or a medium - temperature mekal plasma and a power law with @xmath67=1.7 ( not shown ) provide excellent fits as long as the column density is allowed to be about 2 to 3 times larger than the galactic value . in this case , kt@xmath73 kev for the medium - temperature plasma .",
    "the ratio of the core spectrum to the two - component mekal plus bremsstrahlung model is shown in figure 5c .",
    "the @xmath43 kev unabsorbed flux for this model is @xmath74 ergs @xmath56 s@xmath2 , corresponding to a core luminosity of @xmath75 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "_ asca _  can not spatially resolve the x - ray emission and so we use the integral pspc spectrum for joint fits .",
    "the spectral coverage to @xmath77 kev provided by _ asca _  allows us to detect a distinct hard x - ray component .",
    "single power - law or mekal plasma models provide extremely poor fits to the _ asca _  plus pspc spectrum ( table 3 ; models a and b ) .",
    "note that this is true even if the abundance is a free parameter in the fits .",
    "the ratio of the joint data to the mekal model ( figure 6 ) clearly illustrates both excess line emission near 0.9 kev and a high energy excess beyond about 5 kev .",
    "a two - component mekal plus power - law model provides the best fit ( model c ) but the mekal temperature is higher than that found for the halo (  3.2.1 ) and the derived abundances are sub - solar .",
    "the abundances can be reconciled with solar if we add to the model the 0.2 kev mekal plasma component found in the halo ( model d ) . in this case , the hard x - ray component requires absorption in excess of the galactic value .",
    "we note that our approach and results differ somewhat from zgw who also fit the joint _ asca _  plus pspc spectrum .",
    "they did not require our soft ( 0.2 kev ) component , nor did they find evidence for intrinsic absorption .",
    "the inclusion of the soft component in our model fits is dictated primarily by our spatial analysis of the pspc image as a function of energy ( which zgw did not undertake ) .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the soft 0.2 kev component is definitely present in the halo ( and hence must be incorporated in the global fit to the _ asca _  plus pspc spectrum ) .",
    "as described in the previous paragraph , inclusion of the 0.2 kev component then leads to higher values of n@xmath78 for the hard component .",
    "this nicely illustrates the power of combining all the available information provided by the x - ray images and spectra when interpreting the complex x - ray emission from starbursts .",
    "the data and best - fitting three component model ( model d ) are shown together in figure 7 and the deconvolved model is shown at full resolution in figure 8 .",
    "the goodness of the fit is illustrated by the ratio of the data to the best - fitting model ( model d ) in figure 9 .",
    "in addition to the 0.2 kev halo component , the second thermal component has a temperature of 0.77 kev , and the hard component is well represented as either a power - law with photon index 1.6 or thermal bremsstrahlung emission with kt @xmath5 11 kev .",
    "the intrinsic column of hi in model d ( of - order @xmath79 @xmath56 ) is similar to that inferred from the dust extinction measured in our optical spectra ( see section 4.2 below ) .",
    "the unabsorbed fluxes for the @xmath43 kev and @xmath80 kev bands are @xmath81 erg @xmath56 s@xmath2 and @xmath82 erg @xmath56 s@xmath2 , respectively ( table 4 ) .",

    ".      we will discuss the nature of the two mekal plasma components extensively in sections 3.3 and 5.2 below .",
    "here we remark that the hard ( powerlaw or bremsstrahlung ) component is most likely due to a combination of inverse compton scattering of soft starburst photons by the relativistic electrons responsible for the radio synchrotron emission ( see moran & lehnert 1997 ) and a population of x - ray binaries",
    ". comparing the flux of this hard component in the energy band of the _ rosat _  hri to that of the ensemble of bright point sources seen in the hri image we find that they are similar .",

    "the hri flux from the three brightest point sources ( having a combined count rate of 0.009 counts s@xmath2 ) is @xmath84 ergs @xmath56 s@xmath2 for @xmath85 @xmath56 ( table 3 ) .",
    "the hard component seen with @xmath23 could thus account for most of the flux from the bright point sources in the hri image .",
    "an identification of the hard component with the three bright point - like sources seen in the hri bandpass ( @xmath5 1 kev ) then argues strongly against the hardest ( @xmath86 kev ) x - rays being dominated by emission from a heavily absorbed agn ( both on morphological grounds , and because a heavily absorbed source would produce too few counts in the hri band ) .",
    "the point - like nature of the hri sources also argues against inverse compton scattering from a diffuse population of radio - synchrotron - emitting electrons .",
    "instead , emission from a population of high - mass x - ray binaries is most likely ( as zgw conclude on independent grounds ) .      the joint _ rosat _  plus _ asca _  x - ray spectrum of arp 299 requires a multi - component fit , as outlined in section 3.2 .",
    "in addition , the different morphologies of the hard and soft pspc images suggest that these spectral components are dominant over different spatial regions in arp 299 .",

    "although component a has the largest amount of foreground extinction in the arp 299 system , the regions between a and c ( at the interface of the two interacting galaxies ) also appear to be heavily reddened , with extinctions at h@xmath10 of @xmath130 magnitudes , steadily decreasing westward from component a. the pa=120 jan88 spectrum shows that the outer regions of the system have relatively low extinction compared to the nuclei , with less than 0.7 magnitude at h@xmath10 at radii 12 to 20 arcsec northwest of component c.    gehrz , sramek and weedman ( 1983 ) measure an h@xmath10/h@xmath126 line flux ratio of 5.5 at the position of component c through a 3.6@xmath40 aperture , which is equivalent to an extinction of 1.4 mag at h@xmath10 .",

    "stanford & wood can be explained if the reddening is strongly peaked at c , the differences between our measured value at a and the hi results can not be explained this way since our slit passed directly over component a. the neutral hydrogen column densities implied by the balmer decrement are about half as large as those measured by stanford & wood .",
    "this disagreement is not surprising , since both estimates depend upon uncertain assumptions : the optically - derived columns assume a normal galactic dust - to - gas ratio and the radio - derived columns are directly proportional to the assumed hi spin temperature .",
    "we conclude that the extinction in arp 299 is quite inhomogeneous . for the purposes of the discussion to follow we will adopt a net extinction at h@xmath10 of 1 magnitude for the emission - line nebula .",
    "this will doubtless underestimate the extinction deep inside the dusty starburst regions ( e.g. nucleus a ) , but we are primarily interested in the energetic requirements of the large - scale nebula .",
    "the measured h@xmath10+[nii]@xmath426548,6584 flux of the nebula in armus , heckman , & miley ( 1990 ) then implies an extinction - corrected h@xmath10+[nii ] luminosity of 5.3 @xmath133 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "based on the typical values measured for the ratio of [ nii]@xmath1346584/h@xmath10 in the nebula ( @xmath5 0.4 to 0.5 ) , the h@xmath10 luminosity alone would be about 3.3 @xmath133 erg s@xmath2 .",

    "the presence of the three strong  nuclear \" components ( a , b , and c ) along with numerous other , fainter knots which are presumably hii regions powered by young stars , are responsible for large variations of the emission - line flux ratios with position along the spectral slits in the may87 and jan88 data . among these data however , several trends are clear .",
    "first , the low - ionization emission line flux ratios are generally at a local minimum at the positions of the nuclei .",

    "at the position of component c , log [ oi]/h@xmath135 and log [ nii]/h@xmath136 , both of which are consistent with photoionization by ob stars .",
    "second , off the nuclei , and away from isolated hii regions , the line ratios can be much greater , reaching values of log [ oi]/h@xmath137 and log [ nii]/h@xmath138",
    ". the line ratios at various locations are summarized in table 5 .",
    "the trends noted above can be seen more clearly if one looks at a plot of emission - line flux ratio vs. emission ",
    "line ( in this case h@xmath10 ) surface brightness for the off ",
    "nuclear points , as is illustrated in fig . 13 . excluding the regions close to the nuclei",
    ", the trend of increasing [ nii]/h@xmath10 and [ sii]/h@xmath10 with decreasing nebular surface brightness is evident .",
    "in contrast the [ oiii]@xmath1345007/h@xmath126 ratio is roughly constant at values of @xmath5 0.7 to 1.5 and shows no obvious trends with distance from the nuclei or nebular surface brightness .",
    "in addition to the correlation of the low  ionization emission  line flux ratios with surface brightness , there is also a correlation between the emission  line flux ratios and the velocity dispersion of the gas . in fig .",
    "14 we plot [ nii]/h@xmath10 and [ sii]/h@xmath10 flux ratios vs. h@xmath10 linewidth in the high resolution may87 spectra . as the line ratios",
    "increase , the velocity dispersion in the gas also increases , suggesting that the physical and dynamical states of the gas are coupled . the nuclear and near - nuclear points ( those within @xmath139 of the nuclei ) do not obey this correlation ( see fig .",
    "14 ) , presumably because the line - broadening in these regions is largely gravitational in origin ( e.g. we sample a significant piece of the rotation curve within the spectroscopic sub - aperture ) .    in summary ,",
    "the fainter , diffuse ionized gas in arp 299 has both relatively stronger low  ionization emission lines and is more kinematically disturbed than the high - surface - brightness gas .      with a number of slits covering the arp 299 nebula",
    ", we can explore the gas kinematics with position , and compare these with other measurements of gas motions in the system , e.g. the hi measurements of stanford & wood ( 1989 ) .",
    "the ionized gas kinematics can be measured via the change in emission - line centroids and widths as a function of position along the slits .",
    "the peak velocity of the h@xmath10 line shows variations of @xmath140 km s@xmath2 across the arp 299 nebula . in general ,",
    "the velocities are blueshifted to the south and redshifted to the north , with respect to the systemic velocity of @xmath141 km s@xmath2 , determined by stanford & wood from the centroid of the large - scale hi rotation curve .",
    "overall , the h@xmath10 kinematics follow the hi rotation curve",
    ". however , near the nuclei the velocity of the h@xmath10 line is at a relative minimum , suggesting the gas in the immediate vicinity of the nuclei is blueshifted by @xmath142 km s@xmath2 with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "this might arise as consequence of a dusty outflow of gas in which the backside flow is partially obscured .",
    "the h@xmath10 linewidths range from less than 50 km s@xmath2 to nearly 600 km s@xmath2 across the arp 299 system . as with the line centroids , spatial variations in the linewidths on the order of 200 km",
    "s@xmath2 are seen on scales as small as 1.5 kpc . near the galactic nuclei , the linewidths",
    "reach a local maximium , typically about @xmath143 km s@xmath2 .",
    "however , if one excludes the points near the nuclei ( see above ) , there is a clear trend of increasing linewidth with decreasing emission - line surface brightness , as depicted in fig .",
    "the broadest lines in the arp 299 system , those with fwhm @xmath144 km s@xmath2 , are found in the lowest surface brightness , diffuse ionized gas in the outer regions of the nebula .",
    "from the extinction - corrected h@xmath10+[nii ] luminosity we estimated in  4.2 above , we deduce that the the total luminosity of the optical emission  line nebula ( summing over all emission lines ) is @xmath145 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "this represents about 4% of the bolometric luminosity of arp 299 and several hundred times the x - ray luminosity of the nebula .",
    "the luminosity of the nebula is so large that we can exclude the possibility that it is heated _ primarily _ by mechanical energy supplied either by the starburst or the galaxy collision itself .",
    "the rate at which a starburst produces mechanical energy ( in the form of supernovae and stellar winds ) is only about 1% of the starburst s bolometric luminosity ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ) .",
    "even if all this mechanical energy is used to heat the emission - line nebula , the resulting luminosity will only be 25% of the observed value .",
    "similarly , the kinetic energy of 10@xmath146 m@xmath21 of interstellar gas moving at 300 km s@xmath2 is @xmath147 ergs . if this energy is entirely dissipated and radiated away by the emission - line nebula during one dynamical crossing - time ( @xmath5 10@xmath148 years ) ,",
    "the resulting heating rate is only 3@xmath1110@xmath149 erg s@xmath2 or 3% of the observed value .",
    "we conclude that the _ primary _ source of energy input to the optical emission - line nebula is most likely to be the ionizing radiation that escapes from the starburst complexes and propogates into the nebula .",
    "the leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) models predict a luminosity in ionizing radiation that is roughly 10% of the bolometric luminosity of the starburst , so that only about 40% of the available radiation is required to power the nebula .",
    "this picture provides a simple and natural explanation for the inverse correlation between the relative strength of the low - ionization lines and the gas surface brightness discussed above ( fig .",
    "13 ) . for individual gas clouds of a given density , the higher the value of the local intensity of the ionizing radiation field , the higher the resulting value of the ionization parameter @xmath150 ( defined to be the ratio of the densities of ionizing photons and electrons within a photoionized gas cloud ) .",
    "simple ionization equilibrium arguments show that @xmath150 determines the ionization state of the gas , and the h@xmath10 surface brightness will be proportional , through recombination , to the intensity of the ionizing radiation field .",
    "thus , the proportionality between @xmath150 and the h@xmath10 surface brightness will naturally produce enhanced relative intensities of low - ionization lines in the faint gas ( see wang , heckman , & lehnert 1998 ) .",
    "we can examine this more quantitatively .",
    "the h@xmath10 luminosity of the nebula ( 3.3@xmath1110@xmath149 implies an ionization rate of @xmath151 . if we assume that this arises equally in nuclei  a \" and  b1 \" , then the radial electron density profile discussed above ( figure 12 ) , leads to a predicted ionization parameter @xmath152 for the gas located at radii of one to a few kpc from the nuclei .",
    "j. sokolowski ( private communication ) has kindly run @xmath153 models of gas that is photoionized by a starburst population of hot stars using the evolutionary synthesis code discussed by leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) .",
    "we use the models in which the cosmically - abundant , refractory elements ( e.g. fe and si ) are locked - up in dust grains ( as in the case of diffuse clouds in our own galaxy ) .",
    "this depletion of gas - phase coolants has the effect of increasing the equilibrium temperature in the photoionized gas and thereby increasing the emissivity in the collisonally - excited forbidden lines with respect to the balmer recombination lines ( shields & kennicutt 1995 ) . for the above value of @xmath150 , the predicted line - ratios are [ sii]@xmath42 6716,6730/h@xmath10 = 0.4 , [ nii]@xmath1346583/h@xmath10 = 0.6 , [ oi]@xmath1346300/h@xmath10 = 0.03 , and [ oiii]@xmath1345007/h@xmath126 = 1.6 , in reasonable agreement with the typical observed values in the _ high_-surface - brightness part of the nebula ( figures 11 , 13 , and 14 ; table 5 ) .",
    "while photoionization clearly dominates the total energy input into the nebula and the excitation near the nuclei , mechanical heating also plays an important role , especially in the diffuse low - surface - brightness gas .",
    "firstly , recall that the estimated mechanical luminosity of the starburst is 25% of the nebula s emission - line luminosity .",
    "secondly , the good correlation we find between the widths of the emission - lines and the line - ratios ( figure 14 ) suggests that there is a connection between the dynamics of the gas and its physical state ( as expected for shock heating ) .",
    "finally , shock - heating may be required to explain the extreme line - ratios present in the very faint outer regions where [ oi]/h@xmath10 = 10 to 20% and [ oiii]/h@xmath154 ( see table 5 ) .",
    "most likely , both photoionization and shocks play a role , with the former being more globally significant , and the latter being important in the most kinematically - disturbed ( faint , outer ) regions .",
    "one property of the emission - line nebula that can be most clearly ascribed to the mechanical energy supplied by the starburst is the gas density / pressure profile ( figure 12 ) . in the starburst ",
    "driven wind models of chevalier & clegg ( 1985 ) , there is a region of radius r@xmath155 ( the starburst ) inside which mass and kinetic energy are injected at a constant rate per unit volume , resulting in a region of hot gas which slowly expands through a sonic radius ( located approximately at the radius of the starburst ) and is then transformed into a supersonic outflow .",
    "the gas pressure inside the starburst is just the static , thermal pressure of the hot fluid that has been produced by thermalization ( shock - heating ) in high - speed collisions between material ejected by supernovae and the ambient interstellar medium .",
    "this pressure is essentially determined by the size of the starburst and the rate at which mass and kinetic energy is injected .",
    "since the sound - crossing time inside the starburst is much shorter than the outflow time ( e.g. since the flow is subsonic inside the starburst itself ) , the pressure is roughly constant throughout this central region .    using the starburst models of leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) to relate the rate at which the starburst injects mass and thermal / mechanical energy to its bolometric luminosity",
    ", we expect the central pressure to be given approximately by :    @xmath156^{-2}\\ k\\,cm^{-3}\\ ] ]    at radii much larger than the starburst radius , the pressure of the outflow is dominated by the wind s ram pressure .",
    "this will essentially be set by the rate at which the starburst injects mass and energy into the outflow , and will drop like the inverse square of distance from the starburst :    @xmath157^{-2}\\ k\\,cm^{-3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath158 is the distance from the starburst ( assuming @xmath159 ) .",
    "these predictions agree reasonably well with the observations of arp 299 .",
    "taking l@xmath9 = 3@xmath1110@xmath20l@xmath21 as a rough estimate of bolometric luminosity for each of the two starbursts and r@xmath155 = 1.3 kpc as their estimated radii , the predicted value p / k = 5 @xmath11 10@xmath12 k @xmath13 is the same as that derived from the temperatures and densities given in  4.1 .",
    "similarly , the predicted value for p / k at a radius of 3 kpc is @xmath160 k @xmath13 ( n@xmath161 = 50 @xmath13 ) , consistent with figure 12 .      in principle",
    ", the x - ray nebula could arise as a significant fraction of the gas initially in the disks of two spiral galaxies is heated collisionally during the galaxies on - going merger . as discussed in  5.1 above",
    ", the maximum rate of collisional heating in a merger will be of - order 3@xmath162 erg s@xmath2 , which is about an order - of - magnitude larger than the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "the mass of hot gas ( 7@xmath1110@xmath163 m@xmath4 ) is also consistent with this picture .",
    "there are however at least two problems with this model .",
    "first , the observed gas temperatures are much too high in the inner region .",
    "that is , cloud collision speeds appropriate to a galactic merger ( 300 to 500 km s@xmath2 ) correspond to postshock temperatures of 1.3 to 3.5 million k , while the observed temperature is 9 million k in the inner region .",
    "second , if x - ray nebulae in colliding / merging galaxies are directly produced by the galactic collision , then we would expect that bright x - ray nebulae would be a common feature of mergers of disk galaxies ( regardless of whether these mergers are undergoing a starburst ) .",
    "wang et al ( 1997 ) and read & ponman ( 1998 ) have shown that this is _ not _ the case . in the wang et al sample of 12 merging / colliding galaxies ( including arp 299 ) ,",
    "the only strong soft x - ray emitters are also strong h@xmath10+[nii ] and far - ir emitters .",
    "put another way , strong soft x - ray emission is not a ubiquitous feature of galaxy mergers ( read & ponman 1998 ) , but instead appears to share a a common power source with the optical line and far - ir emission ( a starburst ) .",
    "we therefore regard the most likely origin of the x - ray nebula in arp 299 to be a superwind .",
    "evidence for outflowing gas in arp 299 comes from the optical spectroscopic data on the kinematically - disturbed faint emission - line filaments and loops ( see  4.4 ) .",
    "the presence of diffuse x - ray - emitting gas extending well outside the optical boundaries of the galaxy and oriented roughly perpendicular to the system s hi major axis is also highly suggestive of an outflow .",
    "in order to quantitatively assess whether the soft x - ray emission can indeed be produced by gas heated by supernovae and stellar winds in the central star - bursting complexes , we will adopt a simple model that assumes that mechanical energy is being continuously injected inside the starburst and used to heat the surrounding gas .",
    "this gas then flows out of the starburst and emits x - rays ( cf .",
    "wang 1995 ) .",
    "in such a model we need to specify the heating rate and the mass - injection rate into the outflow .",
    "as noted earlier , the ir luminosity of arp 299 , when used in conjunction with the starburst models of leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) , corresponds to a total mechanical heating rate of about @xmath164 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "we will assume that the gas in the starburst is initially heated to a temperature of about @xmath165 k ( the temperature of the hottest diffuse gas that we detect in our x - ray data ) .",
    "for the heating rate given above , conservation of energy then implies that gas is heated at a rate of @xmath166 m@xmath4 per year ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ) .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude greater than the predicted rate at which supernovae and stellar winds return mass to the interstellar medium in this system .",
    "this implies that the outflow is strongly `` mass - loaded '' : most of the outflowing material is ambient interstellar gas in and around the starburst that has been heated by the supernovae and stellar winds ( see suchkov et al 1996 ) . in effect",
    ", each supernova heats up , on average , about 200 m@xmath4 of interstellar gas . in this case",
    ", we would expect the average metallicity of the x - ray emitting gas to be similar to that in the interstellar medium of arp 299 .",
    "since the predicted mechanical heating rate is about @xmath167 times the total luminosity of the two mekal thermal components , we will ignore the dynamical effect of radiative cooling in our simple model .",
    "this neglect is further justified since the estimated radiative cooling time of the x - ray gas ( approximately a gyr - see  3.3 above ) is much longer than the adiabatic expansion timescale ( @xmath168 years ) .",
    "following chevalier & clegg ( 1985 ) and wang ( 1995 ) we therefore consider a spherically - symmetric wind with a mass outflow rate of 100 m@xmath4 per year which is `` fed '' by hot gas that is injected at a uniform temperature of @xmath165 k. we will take the overall size of the energy injection region ( encompassing both the eastern and western starbursts ) to be similar to that of the bright x - ray emission in the hri data ( radius @xmath5 4 kpc ) .",
    "this is obviously an oversimplication , but might roughly represent the effect of the collision between the two outflows produced by the eastern and western starbursts , and the subsequent shocks and rethermalization of the gas on these size - scales . in the absence of gravitational decelleration ,",
    "the wind would reach a terminal velocity of v@xmath169 = 800 km s@xmath2 ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ) .",
    "we assume the wind cools through adiabatic expansion while also emitting soft x - rays .",
    "the emissivity of gas in the 0.1 to 2.4 kev energy band is constant to within about a factor of @xmath170 as a function of temperature over the range between @xmath171 k to @xmath172 k ( @xmath173 erg @xmath89 s@xmath2 for solar metallicity ) .",
    "this then allows us to predict an x - ray luminosity from the outflow of @xmath174 erg s@xmath2 from within a region equal in size to the x - ray halo ( radius of @xmath5 20 kpc ) .",
    "this rough estimate compares reasonably well with the measured luminosity of the two mekal x - ray components of @xmath175 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the total predicted mass of the hot gas will be about @xmath176 m@xmath4 and the predicted thermal plus kinetic energy in the outflow will be @xmath177 ergs .",
    "again , these predicted values agree reasonably well with the derived values for the sum of the hot ( 0.77 kev ) and warm ( 0.2 kev ) components : m @xmath178 m@xmath4 and e@xmath179 ergs .",
    "note that a radius of 20 kpc and a wind terminal velocity of 800 km s@xmath2 corresponds to a rough dynamical age of 25 myr ( reasonable for a starburst ) .",
    "if the outflow has lasted much longer than this , the total mass and energy in the flow will rise accordingly , but this will comprise material at larger radii ( @xmath180 20 kpc ) . such material will have a low density and ( due to adiabatic cooling ) a low temperature , and would therefore not produce significant x - ray emission ( cf .",
    "wang 1995 ) .",
    "in fact , our simple model predicts a temperature range in the hot gas ranging from @xmath165 k in the energy injection region to @xmath181 k at a radius of 4 kpc to @xmath182 k at a radius of 20 kpc .",
    "these temperatures then span the observed / inferred range , and the temperatures reach the lower limit where the rosat pspc sensitivity plummets ( @xmath183 k ) at roughly the same radius as where the observed emission ends .    having demonstrated that this simple model can very roughly reproduce the gross properties of the x - ray emission , we next consider the fate of this outflowing gas .",
    "following wang ( 1995 ) , the `` escape temperature '' for hot gas in a galaxy potential with an escape velocity v@xmath184 is given by :    t@xmath184 @xmath185 @xmath186 ( v@xmath184/300 km s@xmath2)@xmath187 @xmath188k    the hi rotation curve of arp 299 has an amplitude of 240 km s@xmath2 out to the edge of the hi distribution at a radius of 22 kpc ( stanford & wood 1989 ) . assuming that arp 299 has an isothermal dark matter halo extending to a radius of 300 kpc , the escape velocity ( see equation 13 in heckman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ) at r = 4 ( 22 ) kpc is about 780 ( 650 ) km s@xmath2 and t@xmath184 = 6.7 ( 4.6 ) @xmath189 k. these temperatures are similar to the range of temperatures we measure for the hot gas ( @xmath190 k for the cooler component and @xmath191 k for the hotter component ) . the escape velocity is also similar to the estimated terminal velocity for the wind ( see above ) .",
    "these rough arguments suggest that the outflowing gas _ may _ be able to escape the gravitational potential of arp 299 .",
    "we have discussed optical and x - ray data on the spectacular gaseous nebula surrounding the infrared - luminous merger / starburst system arp 299 (= ngc 3690 or mrk 171 ) .",
    "we suggest that the on  going galaxy collision has tidally redistributed the cold interstellar media of the merging galaxies .",
    "the total luminosity of the optical emission - line nebula ( 10@xmath192 erg s@xmath2 @xmath5 4% l@xmath9 ) is too high to be powered primarily by either the collision of two galaxies directly , or by a starburst - driven superwind . instead , the gas is mostly photoionized by radiation from the ongoing starburst .",
    "we find strong trends in which the relative strengths of low - ionization lines ( [ sii ] , [ nii ] , and [ oi ] ) increase systematically with both decreasing nebular surface brightness and with increasing velocity dispersion .",
    "these trends can be understood if both hot stars and large  scale shocks play a role in energizing the gas .",
    "the shocks become increasingly important in the faint , outer regions of the nebula , and they provide for the coupling between the dynamical and physical state of the gas .",
    "we also find that the gas pressures are high in the inner optical emission - line nebula ( p / k @xmath5 5@xmath1110@xmath12 k @xmath13 within a radius of a kpc , and fall systematically with radius ( dropping below p / k @xmath5 10@xmath12 k @xmath13 at a radius of @xmath5 3 kpc ) .",
    "the shape and amplitude of the radial pressure profile agrees with the pressures predicted for starburst - driven outflows .",
    "while the luminosity ( @xmath193 erg s@xmath2 ) and mass ( @xmath194 m@xmath4 ) of the x - ray nebula can be explained by the collision of the interstellar media of two galaxies , we believe a more plausible heating source is the superwind .",
    "the thermal energy content ( @xmath147 ergs ) and dynamical age ( @xmath195 years ) of the x - ray nebula agree with a superwind model , but its high gas mass and x - ray luminosity , and it relatively low temperature ( 9 million k in the inner region and 2.3 million k in the outer ) imply that the outflow must be strongly ` mass - loaded ' ( most of the x - ray emitting gas is ambient interstellar material that has been mixed into the outflow ) . the implied outflow rate of @xmath196 per year can be compared to the estimated star - formation rate in the starburst of 40 ( 100 ) @xmath197 per year for a salpeter imf extending down to 1 ( 0.1 ) @xmath197 .",
    "the inner gas temperature of 9 million k implies a terminal velocity for such a flow of about 800 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these respective values are similar to the estimated escape temperature and escape velocity from the system .",
    "thus , perhaps the most striking result of this investigation is that in arp 299 a powerful starburst has apparently been able to heat up a significant fraction of the interstellar medium of the merger product ( nearly 10@xmath146 m@xmath21 ) to a temperature and outflow speed that may allow this gas ultimately to escape the system .",
    "this has implications for understanding how disk - disk galaxy mergers may produce ( at least some ) elliptical galaxies ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ; schweizer 1992 ) and how the intergalactic medium could have been polluted by metal - enriched material ( see gibson , loewenstein , & mushotzky 1997 ) .      this research was primarily supported by nasa ltsa grants nagw-3138 to th and nagw-4025 to kw .",
    "the research by la described in this paper was carried out by the california institute of technology , under a contract with nasa .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
