    "due to angular momentum conservation , the collapse of rotating cloud cores leads to the formation of stars surrounded by disks .",
    "these disks evolve because they are accreting mass onto the star and because the dust grains tend to settle towards the midplane where they collide and grow ( e.g. hartmann et al .",
    "1998 , hartmann 2009 ) .",
    "the material in the disk is subject to irradiation from the host star and from the high energy fields produced in accretion shocks on the stellar surface , in the stellar active regions , and in the environment , if the star is immersed in the radiation field of nearby ob stars in a stellar cluster @xcite .",
    "these high energy fields heat the gas , eventually leading to its dissipation , while the solids grow to planetesimal and planet sizes .",
    "still , many open questions remain on how these processes happen and interact with each other .",
    "+ previous studies using spitzer data of different star - forming regions with ages between 1 and 10 myr , show a decrease of disk fraction as a function of age of the clusters ( hernndez et al . 2007a , henceforward h07a ) .",
    "the decrease of disk frequency is reflected as a clear drop in the mid - ir excess , indicating that only 20@xmath8 of the stars retain their original disks by 5 myr @xcite .",
    "it is therefore essential to observe disks in the crucial age range between 2 and 10 myr in which the agents driving the evolution of protoplanetary disks are most active .",
    "the decrease of the ir excess can be explained by grain growth and by settling of dust to the disk midplane , reducing the flaring of the disk and thus its emitting flux .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by the analysis made by @xcite using irradiated accretion disk models .",
    "these models simulate the settling process by introducing the @xmath9 parameter , which represents the gas - to - dust mass ratio at the disk atmosphere compared to that of the ism . in this sense",
    ", a depletion of small grains in the upper layer of the disks will be reflected as a small value of @xmath9 .",
    "unevolved disks , on the other hand , will have @xmath9 values close to unity .    once the dust has settled , large bodies present in the disk will interact with its local environment creating more complex radial structures like inner clearings or gaps .",
    "the most probable mechanism responsible for this effect is an orbiting companion , either stellar or planetary , that cleared out the material in the inner disk @xcite .",
    "this mechanism can explain some of the so called transitional and pre - transitional disks ( tds and ptds hereafter ) .",
    "also important is disk truncation via mass loss . besides an orbiting planet , truncation of the _ inner _ disk may result from the dissipation of gas being heated by high - energy radiation fields coming from the host star @xcite .",
    "evidence of mass loss in disks comes from forbidden emission lines of ionized species like [ sii ] , [ oi ] , [ neii ] and [ nii ] .",
    "the low velocity component of these lines has been associated with photoevaporative winds that might be able to explain some of the td and ptds observed @xcite .",
    "the truncation of the _ outer _ parts of the disks , on the other hand , may be the result of environmental effects , like mass loss due to high energy photons from nearby massive stars impinging on the surface of the disk and heating the less tightly bound material .",
    "expected mass loss rates in externally - illuminated disks can be substantial @xcite , and when incorporated into viscous evolution models @xcite can have a strong impact on the disk structure and lifetime .",
    "externally - illuminated disks , known as proplyds , have been well characterized in the orion nebula cluster ( hereafter onc ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) where the radiation from the trapezium stars photoevaporates the disks .",
    "evidence of outer photoevaporation in other star - forming regions has also been found @xcite .",
    "multiplicity can also produce truncated disks . the fraction of binary companions in young regions can be @xmath030% or larger where close ( @xmath10 100 au )",
    "binaries can affect the evolution of protoplanetary and circumbinary disks by significantly reducing their lifetime @xcite . in taurus star - forming region",
    "the disk population affected by multiplicity constitutes close binaries with separations @xmath1040 au @xcite .    in order to understand what physical processes cause the disks to evolve ,",
    "many multiband observations of different regions within a wide range of ages and environments have been made .",
    "many of these studies have used data from the spitzer space telescope to describe the state of gas and dust within the first au from the central object . in the @xmath05 myr old @xcite upper scorpius ob association @xcite examined , among others , 7 late - type disk - bearing ( k+m ) members using the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) .",
    "they found a lack of sub - micron dust grains in the inner regions of the disks and that the strength of silicate emission is spectral - type dependent . in a disk census performed by @xcite with spitzer and wise photometry they found that late - type members have a higher inner disk fraction than early - types .",
    "the @xmath010 myr old @xcite tw hydrae ( tw hya ) association has also been the target for different disk evolution studies .",
    "@xcite analyzed two objects with ir excesses on their irs spectra .",
    "they found signs of significant grain growth and dust processing and also evidence of dust clearing in the inner ( @xmath04 au ) disks , possibly due to the presence of orbiting planets .",

    "many works have been done using the photodetector array camera & spectrometer ( pacs ) instrument on board the herschel space observatory .",

    "+ the @xmath03 myr old @xmath1 ori cluster ( h07a ) is an excellent laboratory for studies of disk evolution for two reasons : first , the large number of stars still harboring disks allows us to obtain results with statistical significance and second , given its intermediate age , one can expect the first traces of disk evolution to become apparent .",

    "we follow the methods of @xcite to calculate the structure and emission of accretion disk models .",
    "the main input parameters are the stellar properties ( m@xmath49 , r@xmath49 , l@xmath49 ) , the mass accretion rate ( @xmath25 ) , the viscosity parameter ( @xmath31 ) , the cosine of the inclination angle ( @xmath2 ) , disk outer radius ( r@xmath50 ) , maximum grain size at the disk midplane ( @xmath51 ) , and the dust settling ; assumed constant throughout the disk .",
    "the composition of the disk consists of amorphous silicates ( pyroxenes ) with a mass fraction of 0.004 and carbonates in the form of graphite with a mass fraction of 0.0025 ( all these mass fractions are relative to gas ) .",

    "both populations follow a size - distribution function of the form @xmath56 ; where @xmath57 is the radius of the grain , whose minimum value is @xmath58= 0.005 @xmath11 , and an exponent @xmath59 equal to 3.5 , resembling the size - distribution found in the ism .",
    "the first population corresponds to small grains with @xmath60 @xmath11-characteristic of ism dust- which is expected in unevolved disks .",

    "the second population consists of larger grains , @xmath61= 1 mm , and lives in the disk midplane . as the settling process takes place on the disk , dust particles will leave the upper layer leaving behind a depleted small grains population , having a dust - to - gas mass ratio , @xmath62 , lower than the initial value , @xmath63 . on the other hand ,",
    "the big grain population will have a dust - to - gas mass ratio , @xmath64 , larger than the initial value , since small dust particles being settled from upper layers will add mass to this population .",
    "therefore , a decrease of @xmath62 automatically implies an increase ( of the same proportion ) of @xmath64 .",
    "we parametrize settling with the parameter @xmath9 , referred to as the dust - to - gas mass ratio and defined as @xmath65 , i.e. , the mass fraction of the small grains relative to the standard value .",

    "a similar situation happens for the @xmath78 index , shown on the right panel . in this case , however , there is more overlap between ranges occupied by models with different degrees of settling .",
    "these results imply that disks in our sample have experienced some evolution over time .",

    "<S> we present new herschel pacs observations of 32 t tauri stars in the young ( @xmath03 myr ) @xmath1 ori cluster . </S>",
    "<S> most of our objects are k & m stars with large excesses at 24 @xmath2 m . we used irradiated accretion disk models of @xcite to compare their spectral energy distributions with our observational data . </S>",
    "<S> we arrive at the following six conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) the observed disks are consistent with irradiated accretion disks systems . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) most of our objects ( 60% ) can be explained by significant dust depletion from the upper disk layers . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) similarly , 61% of our objects can be modeled with large disk sizes ( @xmath3 100 au ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) the masses of our disks range between 0.03 to 39 @xmath4 , where 35% of our objects have disk masses lower than 1 jupiter . </S>",
    "<S> although these are lower limits , high mass ( @xmath5 0.05 m@xmath6 ) disks , which are present e.g , in taurus , are missing . </S>",
    "<S> ( v ) by assuming a uniform distribution of objects around the brightest stars at the center of the cluster , we found that 80% of our disks are exposed to external fuv radiation of @xmath7 , which can be strong enough to photoevaporate the outer edges of the closer disks . </S>",
    "<S> ( vi ) within 0.6 pc from we found forbidden emission lines of [ nii ] in the spectrum of one of our large disk ( so662 ) , but no emission in any of our small ones . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that this object may be an example of a photoevaporating disk . </S>"
