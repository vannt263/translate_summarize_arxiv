    "* hereafter s2000 ) published an ultraviolet ( uv ) flux - limited catalog of galaxies , imaged with the foca balloon - borne uv camera of @xcite .",
    "the catalog is an extension of work by @xcite , and contains 273 galaxies with redshifts @xmath5 .",
    "vacuum uv imaging enables the direct detection of radiation from hot , massive stars and , by association , actively star forming galaxies .",
    "the luminosity function ( lf ) of the uv - selected galaxies is somewhat surprising .",
    "s2000 find a faint end slope in the @xcite parametrization of the lf , @xmath6 , steeper than typical optical lf faint end slopes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) . as a result",
    ", s2000 find no strong decrease in uv luminosity density between @xmath7 and @xmath8 and thus little decline in the density of star formation over this range of cosmic epochs .",
    "in contrast , @xcite conclude that there is a factor of @xmath9 decline in the comoving density of star formation between redshifts @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "this conclusion is based on a combination of rest frame near - uv luminosities from the @xmath11-selected canada france redshift survey @xcite and local h@xmath12 measures from gallego et al.s ( 1995 ) objective prism survey .    curiously , a substantial fraction of the s2000 uv - selected galaxies have ( uv@xmath4 colors bluer than the bluest color that can be produced by starburst spectral synthesis models @xcite .",
    "s2000 could therefore not explain the color of these galaxies .",
    "here we propose that the extremely blue galaxies are wolf - rayet ( wr ) galaxies .",
    "wr galaxies show direct signatures of wr stars in their spectra , usually a broad he ii @xmath13 feature originating in the stellar winds of wr stars .",
    "this subtle feature is not seen in the fiber - spectra of s2000 ( m. sullivan 2000 , private communication ) , but requires good s / n and is spatially dependent on the inclusion of starburst regions @xcite .",
    "the starburst regions dominate the broadband uv flux and , though short - lived ( @xmath14 yrs ) , wr stars can dominate the uv light of young starbursts .    in this paper",
    "we describe optical photometry for 67% of the s2000 selected area 57 ( sa57 ) uv - selected galaxy sample .",
    "our goal is to compare the optical and uv colors , and to suggest that wr emission lines are the source of the extremely blue colors found by s2000 . in section 2",
    "we discuss our data , in section 3 we discuss the ( ) colors , and in section 4 we discuss the impact of wolf - rayet uv emission lines on the interpretation of the uv sample .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "we obtained broadband @xmath0 and @xmath1 images in 1998 december and 1999 february with the mosaic camera on the kitt peak national observatory 0.9 m telescope .",
    "mosaic is an 8 ccd array with pixel scale 0.424 arcsec pixel@xmath15 and field of view @xmath16 x @xmath16 on the 0.9 m .",
    "we obtained three offset 200 sec @xmath1 and 333 sec @xmath0 images at each position along a strip in ra .",
    "our data serendipitously overlap with 148 of the 222 s2000 uv - selected galaxies in the sa57 region .",
    "we processed the images in the standard way with the iraf mscred package .",
    "total magnitudes are obtained using sextractor @xcite .",
    "seven percent of the magnitudes are obtained with a modified version of iraf - based galphot @xcite .",
    "galphot allows photometry of galaxies poorly fit by sextractor , including low surface brightness galaxies or galaxies with close companions .",
    "a comparison between the two software packages yields a 1-@xmath17 scatter in the total galaxy magnitudes of @xmath18 mag .",
    "we use landolt fields @xcite and the m67 cluster @xcite for flux calibration . depending on the nightly seeing conditions , the error in the standard star calibration is @xmath19 mag .",
    "a direct measure of our intrinsic error is the rms scatter of measurements of identical galaxies taken on different nights : @xmath20 mag .",
    "the photometry includes galactic extinction corrections from @xcite , who combine @xmath21/dirbe and @xmath22/issa data to map dust emission in the milky way .",
    "typical extinction values are @xmath23 and @xmath24 mag .",
    "the photometry also includes `` k corrections '' for the changing rest frame bandpass @xcite . because we know the ( ) color and the redshift of each galaxy , we can determine accurate k corrections .",
    "typical values for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bandpasses are @xmath25 and @xmath26 mag .",
    "the s2000 uv measurements were made from a balloon - borne , 40 cm cassegrain telescope stabilized to 2 arcsec rms .",
    "the filter response approximates a gaussian centered at 2015  , with a fwhm of 188  .",
    "the limiting magnitude in the uv catalog is m@xmath27 .",
    "s2000 state that the uv zero - point is accurate to @xmath28 mag ; the uncertainty in the relative photometry may reach @xmath29 mag at the limiting magnitude .    with the uv images in hand , s2000 searched for optical counterparts in digitized poss plates .",
    "s2000 obtained accurate positions and @xmath2 photometry , with uncertainty @xmath30 mag , from the poss plates .",
    "we follow s2000 and only use galaxies with a single optical counter - part when discussing uv colors .",
    "s2000 used the resulting ( uv@xmath4 colors to calculate k corrections . finally , s2000 apply a reddening correction based on h@xmath12 and h@xmath31 line strengths and the empirical @xcite extinction law for starburst galaxies .",
    "they applied a mean reddening correction @xmath32 to galaxies lacking h@xmath12 and/or h@xmath31 emission .",
    "the ( uv@xmath33 colors we quote from s2000 include k corrections and reddening corrections .",
    "our ( ) colors include k corrections but no reddening corrections , because s2000 do not provide enough information to reproduce their reddening corrections . even if this reddening data were provided , 72% of the galaxies with ( ) colors",
    "lack both h@xmath12 and h@xmath31 emission . for these galaxies ,",
    "the mean reddening correction would add a uniform @xmath34 mag offset to the ( ) colors .",
    "figure 1 shows that the ( ) colors of the uv - selected galaxies are significantly bluer than those from an @xmath1-selected galaxy sample , the century survey @xcite .",
    "the century survey is a complete redshift survey of 102 square degrees to a limiting magnitude @xmath35 , containing 1762 galaxies .",
    "the century survey galaxies have median @xmath36 ; the uv - selected galaxies have median @xmath3 .",
    "the distribution in figure 1 appears double - peaked , but application of the non - parametric estimator of @xcite shows the second peak is not significant .",
    "the @xcite kernel probability estimator allows estimation of the probability density distribution underlying a data sample . in applying this",
    "we assume an average 1-@xmath17 ( ) error @xmath37 mag .    the s2000 ( uv@xmath33 colors provide a measure of the star formation activity , but there is no correlation between the ( ) and ( uv@xmath33 colors .",
    "unlike the extreme blue ( uv@xmath33 colors found by s2000 , however , the optical ( ) colors are consistent with starburst galaxy colors .",
    "for example , the template starburst - galaxy spectral energy distributions sb1 and           sb2 of @xcite have synthetic @xmath38 .",
    "all but two of the s2000 uv - selected galaxies are redder than @xmath39 , and we note that these blue outliers appear atypically faint and point - like in our images .",
    "thus @xmath40 of the uv galaxy ( ) colors are consistent with starburst galaxy colors .",
    "if the extreme blue galaxies were agn , their average color should be @xmath41 @xcite , which is clearly not the case .",
    "an unresolved issue from the s2000 paper is the existence of galaxies with ( uv@xmath33 colors @xmath42 , colors too blue to be explained by standard spectral synthesis models . in our subsample of the s2000",
    "uv - selected galaxies , 48 of 148 galaxies have ( uv@xmath43 , yet the optical ( ) colors show no significant departure from the rest of the sample .",
    "a ks test gives an 80% probability of the extreme ( uv@xmath43 and the other uv - selected galaxies being drawn from the same distribution of ( ) colors .",
    "next we examine the redshift distribution of the extremely blue galaxies .",
    "the lower panel of figure 2 shows the redshift distribution of the extreme blue ( uv@xmath43 galaxies , and the upper panel the remaining ( uv@xmath44 galaxies .",
    "figure 2 shows that the extreme blue galaxies are preferentially found at high redshift . a ks - test yields a @xmath45 probability of the two populations being drawn from the same distribution .",
    "the peaks in the redshift histograms ( figure 2 ) are well matched to the @xmath46 limit of the medium deep survey @xcite , which includes the sa57 region .",
    "the medium - deep survey is @xmath47 complete to @xmath48 mag , and gives a sense of the existing large scale structure in the direction of uv survey .",
    "thus the extremely blue galaxies appear to trace the same large - scale structure as `` normal '' galaxies .      the very blue ( uv@xmath43 galaxies are an extreme population of galaxies found mostly at larger redshift .",
    "an explanation probably requires emission lines redshifting into the uv bandpass .",
    "because s2000 and our @xmath49 color distribution rule out agn , it seems plausible the emission lines come from a stellar emission line source , i.e.  wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , planetary nebulae , or symbiotic stars .",
    "because there are known galaxies with wr features , we suggest that the extreme blue ( uv@xmath43           galaxies are wr galaxies .",
    "the strongest uv features come from ionized c , o , he , si , and fe in the stellar winds of wr stars ( e.g.  hillier & miller 1999 ) .",
    "our optical spectra of 10 extreme blue galaxies all show narrow emission lines indicative of active star formation .",
    "wr galaxies are characterized by the direct signatures of wr stars in their spectra , but our s / n is too poor to detect a possible @xmath13 wr feature convincingly .    to calculate a typical ( ) color for wr galaxies , we searched the nasa / ipac extragalactic database for photometery of known wr galaxies .",
    "the average optical color of 13 wr galaxies is @xmath50 mag .",
    "this average color is in agreement with the blue color we find for the ( uv@xmath43 sample , @xmath51 mag .",
    "figure 3 illustrates how wr emission lines are redshifted into the s2000 uv bandpass .",
    "we plot a sample wr ultraviolet spectrum , wc star hd 165763 @xcite , at redshift @xmath8 and at redshift @xmath52 with the s2000 uv and @xmath2 bandpasses overlaid .",
    "integration of the uv bandpass over the redshifted spectrum shows that the wr emission lines can boost the uv flux by a factor of @xmath53 compared to the flux at @xmath8 .",
    "we also integrate the @xmath2 bandpass over the @xcite wc stellar spectrum , and find the ( uv@xmath4 color is shifted up to 1.3 mag bluewards over the redshift range z=0 to z=0.5 ( see        figure 4 ) , blue enough to explain @xmath54 of the extreme blue ( uv@xmath33 galaxies in the sa57 uv - selected sample .",
    "the wc stellar spectrum represents a maximal effect ; known wr galaxies have typical wc / wn ratios of 0.2 - 0.4 @xcite .",
    "we perform the ( uv@xmath4 calculation on the wn stellar spectrum , wr152 @xcite , and find the ( uv@xmath4 color shifts up to 1.1 mag bluewards over the same redshift range ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "we acknowledge that strong uv emission lines are not common features of known low redshift wr galaxies ( leitherer 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "we calculate the shifts in ( uv@xmath4 for a dozen of the @xcite `` uv to optical spectral distributions of northern star - forming galaxies , '' and find an average @xmath55 mag ( mostly due to the continua , not the emission lines ) . yet",
    "good examples of the very blue objects may not be found locally .",
    "the uv selection should pick out extreme objects ; known wr galaxies are optically selected .",
    "we note the very blue uv galaxies have median z=0.2 . by comparison ,",
    "the @xcite catalog of known wr galaxies drops off sharply at z=0.02 .",
    "we can also take advantage of @xmath56 fos observations of the small magellanic cloud h ii region n88a @xcite as a uv spectral templates for wr galaxies .",
    "when the s2000 bandpass is centered on the strong ciii and siiii lines in this object , the uv flux doubles compared to the surrounding continuum level .",
    "s2000 compute their luminosity function ( lf ) with the full uv sample ; here we construct a model lf for the wr galaxies alone . the impact of the emission lines on the observed uv flux changes with redshift .",
    "we explore the selection function for finding wr galaxies in a magnitude limited redshift survey by computing the change in absolute magnitude resulting from the uv emission lines .",
    "wr galaxies are blue and show active star formation .",
    "we thus use the second southern sky redshift survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ssrs2 ) lf for the bluest galaxies , the magellanic spiral and irregulars , as the basis of our model .",
    "the ssrs2 is a @xmath2-selected survey complete to @xmath57 that contains 5404 galaxies , all with morphological classifications .",
    "the ssrs2 sm - irr lf has a steep faint - end slope , @xmath58 , similar to the s2000 lf , @xmath59 .",
    "we compute the selection function for the wr galaxies according to equation ( 1 ) , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the co - moving distance .",
    "we assume a flat cosmology and @xmath62=100 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath63=0.5 .",
    "@xmath64 is the luminosity function in the @xcite        parameterization , @xmath65 @xmath66^{(1+\\alpha)}$ ] @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the normalization ( galaxies per unit volume ) , @xmath12 is the faint end slope , and @xmath69 is the characteristic absolute magnitude . to convert the ssrs2 sm - irr @xmath70 to the uv bandpass",
    ", we add the median ( uv@xmath71 color for the uv galaxies .",
    "to simulate wr galaxies , we add the relative change in ( uv@xmath4 over redshift ( figure 4 ) : @xmath72\\ ] ] to find the number of galaxies in redshift bin @xmath73 , we integrate @xmath64 to the limiting absolute magnitude @xmath74 over the volume of the redshift interval @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "the selection functions represent the number of galaxies expected per unit redshift if galaxies are uniformly distributed .",
    "the curves in figure 2 are the uv selection functions normalized to the observed number of galaxies .",
    "the selection function for the s2000 lf ( @xmath77 ) is very similar to the ssrs2 sm - irr lf ( @xmath78uv@xmath79 @xmath58 ) , and matches the ( uv@xmath44 galaxy redshift distribution ( figure 2 , upper panel ) quite well .",
    "in contrast , the uv selection function we calculate for wr galaxies predicts more wr galaxies at large redshifts .",
    "the redshift distribution of ( uv@xmath43 galaxies ( figure 2 , lower panel ) matches the wr selection function curves much better than the s2000 curve .",
    "the shifts we make in @xmath69 reflect only the change in the flux through the uv bandpass as a function of redshift .",
    "thus the uv emission lines of wr galaxies can explain the extreme blue ( uv@xmath33 colors _ and _ the redshift distribution of the ( uv@xmath43 galaxies .",
    "we calculate the number density of century survey ( which includes the sa57 region ) galaxies to the same effective limiting magnitude and solid angle as the uv sample , and find that the extreme blue objects are @xmath801% of a `` normal '' ( @xmath1-selected ) galaxy population .",
    "it is difficult to compare the known wr galaxy fraction .",
    "we estimate a lower limit by assuming the wr catalog of @xcite is complete to @xmath2=14 mag over the northern sky above 15 deg galactic latitude .",
    "the resulting wr galaxy fraction lower limit is 0.75% .",
    "thus the extreme blue galaxy number density is consistent with the abundance of known wr galaxies .",
    "we show that the extreme blue ( uv@xmath43 galaxies observed by s2000 may be wr galaxies , starburst galaxies with strong uv emission from wr stars .",
    "the model explains the observed ( uv@xmath43 colors and the redshift distribution for the bluest objects .",
    "the average ( ) color of 13 known wr galaxies taken from the literature , @xmath50 , is consistent with the range of ( ) colors we observe for the extreme blue ( uv@xmath43 galaxies .",
    "we measure a median optical color @xmath3 for 67% of the s2000 sa57 , uv - selected sample .",
    "the uv emission lines can double or triple the flux through the s2000 uv bandpass at large redshift . as a result ,",
    "the ( uv@xmath4 color of a wr galaxy can become up to 1.3 mag bluer at larger redshift . this changing ( uv@xmath4 as a function of redshift predicts a selection function weighted toward large redshifts .",
    "not only do we find an excess of ( uv@xmath43 galaxies at large redshift , compared to the ( uv@xmath44 sample , but our model matches the observed redshift distribution well .",
    "we plan to test this model by obtaining high quality spectra of the suspected wr galaxies and looking for the telltale broad wr emission features .",
    "we thank r.  ellis , m.  sullivan , a.  barth , c.  leitherer , and the referee , h.  ferguson , for their thoughtful comments and careful reading of the paper .",
    "we thank a.  mahdavi for the use of his `` kernel '' code to do the @xcite statistical calculation .",
