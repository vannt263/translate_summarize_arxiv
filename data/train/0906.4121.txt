    "canonical forms of matrices over principal ideal domains ( such as @xmath10 or @xmath11 $ ] , for a field @xmath5 ) have proven invaluable for both mathematical and computational purposes .",
    "one of the successes of computer algebra over the past three decades has been the development of fast algorithms for computing these canonical forms .",
    "these include triangular forms such as the hermite form @xcite , low degree forms like the popov form @xcite , as well as the diagonal smith form @xcite .",
    "canonical forms of matrices over non - commutative domains , especially rings of differential and difference operators , are also extremely useful .",
    "these have been examined at least since @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a typical domain under consideration is that of differential polynomials . for our purposes these are polynomials over a function field @xmath12 ( where @xmath5 is a field of characteristic zero , typically an extension of @xmath13 , or some representation of @xmath14 ) .",
    "a differential indeterminate @xmath15 is adjoined to form the _ ring of differential polynomials _ @xmath16 $ ] , which consists of the polynomials in @xmath17 $ ] under the usual addition and a non - commutative multiplication defined such that @xmath18 , for any @xmath19 . here",

    "a primary motivation in the definition of @xmath26 $ ] is that there is a natural action on the space of infinitely differentiable functions in @xmath27 , namely the differential polynomial @xmath28\\ ] ] acts as the linear differential operator @xmath29 on a differentiable function @xmath30 .",
    "solving and analyzing systems of such operators involves working with matrices over @xmath16 $ ] , and invariants such as the differential analogues of the smith , popov and hermite forms provide important structural information .    in commutative domains such as @xmath10 and",
    "@xmath11 $ ] , it has been more common to compute the triangular hermite and diagonal smith form ( as well as the lower degree popov form , especially as an intermediate computation ) .",
    "indeed , these forms are more canonical in the sense of being canonical in their class under multiplication by unimodular matrices .",
    "polynomial - time algorithms for the smith and hermite forms over @xmath11 $ ] were developed by @xcite , with important advances by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and many others .",
    "one of the key features of this recent work in computing normal forms has been a careful analysis of the complexity in terms of matrix size , entry degree , and coefficient swell . clearly identifying and analyzing",
    "the cost in terms of all these parameters has led to a dramatic drop in both theoretical and practical complexity .",
    "computing the classical smith and hermite forms of matrices over differential ( and more general ore ) domains has received less attention though normal forms of differential polynomial matrices have applications in solving differential systems and control theory .",
    "@xcite analyzes the number of reduction steps necessary to compute a row - reduced form , while @xcite analyze the complexity of row reduction in terms of matrix size , degree and the sizes of the coefficients of some shifts of the input matrix .",
    "@xcite demonstrates tight bounds on the degree and coefficient sizes of the output , which we will employ here . for the popov form",

    "this idea is extended in @xcite to compute popov form of general ore polynomial matrices . in @xcite , they reduce the problem of computing popov form to a nullspace computation .",
    "however , though popov form is useful for rewriting high order terms with respect to low order terms , we want a different normal form more suited to solving system of linear diophantine equations . since the hermite form is upper triangular it meets this goal nicely , not to mention the fact that it is a `` classical '' canonical form . in a slightly different vein",

    "also , while this example does not demonstrate it , it is common that the degrees in the hermite form , in both @xmath27 an @xmath15 , are substantially larger than in the input .    in this paper",

    "also , by corollary  [ cor : hnd ] , the degree in @xmath15 of every diagonal entry of @xmath1 is bounded by @xmath236 , and every off - diagonal has degree in @xmath15 less than that of the diagonal below it ( and hence less than @xmath236 ) , and we can set all coefficients of larger powers of @xmath15 to @xmath237 in @xmath214 .",
    "the resulting system @xmath210 , restricted as above according to theorem  [ thm : hermsys ] , has @xmath215 linear equations in @xmath238 unknowns .",
    "since the coefficients in @xmath212 are all of the form @xmath239 , and since this does not affect their degree in @xmath27 , the degree in @xmath27 of entries of @xmath212 is the same as that of @xmath2 , namely @xmath216 .    with more work",
    ", we believe the dimension of the system can be reduced to @xmath240 if we apply the techniques presented in @xcite section 4.3 , wherein the unknown coefficients of @xmath214 are removed from the system .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "so far , we have shown how to convert the differential system over @xmath46}}$ ] into a linear system over @xmath12 .",
    "also , we note , by theorem  [ thm : hermsys ] , that the correct degree of the @xmath129th diagonal entry in the hermite form of @xmath2 can be found by seeking the smallest non - negative integer @xmath164 such that @xmath194 is consistent when @xmath241 for @xmath242 and @xmath243 . using binary search",
    ", we can find the correct degrees of all diagonal entries by solving at most @xmath244 systems .",
    "we then find the correct degrees of the diagonal entries in the hermite form of @xmath2 , solving the system @xmath194 with the correct diagonal degrees gives the matrices @xmath3 and @xmath1 such that @xmath4 where @xmath1 is the hermite form of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath245[{{\\mathcal{d}}};\\delta]^{{n\\times n}}$ ] with @xmath155 and @xmath208 for @xmath209 .",
    "then we can compute the hermite form @xmath47}}$ ] of @xmath2 , and a unimodular @xmath246[{{\\mathcal{d}}};\\delta]}}$ ] such that @xmath4 , with @xmath247 operations in @xmath5    lemma  [ lem : hlin ] and the following discussion , above shows that computing @xmath3 and @xmath1 is reduced to solving @xmath244 systems of linear equations over @xmath12 , each of which is @xmath248 for @xmath249 and in which the entries have degree @xmath216 . using standard linear algebra",
    "this can be solved with @xmath250 operations in @xmath5 , since any solution has degree at most @xmath251 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a somewhat better strategy is to use the @xmath27-adic lifting approach of @xcite , which would require @xmath252 operations in @xmath5 for each system , giving a total cost of @xmath247 operations in @xmath5 .",
    "as noted above , it is expected that we can bring this cost down through a smaller system similar to that of @xcite , to a cost of @xmath253 .",
    "nonetheless , the algorithm as it is stated achieves a guaranteed polynomial - time solution .",
    "it is often the case that we are considering differential systems over @xmath254 $ ] , where we must contend with growth in coefficients in @xmath15 , @xmath27 _ and _ in the size of the rational coefficients .",
    "however , once again we may employ the fact that the hermite form and unimodular transformation matrix are solutions of a linear system over @xmath255 $ ] . for convenience",
    ", we can assume in fact that our input is in @xmath86[{{\\mathcal{d}}};\\delta]^{{n\\times n}}$ ] ( since the rational matrix to eliminate denominators is unimodular in @xmath254 $ ] ) .",
    "there is some amount of extra coefficient growth when going from @xmath2 to @xmath212 ; namely we take up to @xmath236 derivatives , introducing a multiplicative constant of size around @xmath256 . in terms of the bit - length of the coefficients , this incurs a multiplicative blow - up of only @xmath257 where @xmath258 .",
    "it follows that we can find the hermite form of @xmath259^{{n\\times n}}$ ] in time polynomial in @xmath6 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 , and @xmath262 , the maximum coefficient length in an entry , for @xmath209 .",
    "a modular algorithm , for example along the lines of @xcite , would improve performance considerably , as might @xmath263-adic solvers and a more careful construction of the linear system .",
    "we have shown that the problem of computing the hermite form of a matrix over @xmath16 $ ] can be accomplished in polynomial time . moreover",
    ", our algorithm will also control growth in coefficient bit - length when @xmath9 .",
    "we have also shown that the degree bounds on hermite forms in the differential ring are very similar to the regular polynomial case . from a practical point of view our method",
    "is still expensive .",
    "our next work will be to investigate more efficient algorithms .",
    "we have suggested ways to compress the system of equations and to employ structured matrix techniques .",
    "also , the use of randomization has been shown to be highly beneficial over @xmath55 $ ] , and should be investigated in this domain .",
