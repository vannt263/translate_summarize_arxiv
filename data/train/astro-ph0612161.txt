    "m85ot2006 - 1  was discovered by the lick observatory supernova search on 2006 january 7 .",
    "it appeared as a new transient projected in the outskirts of the lenticular virgo cluster galaxy m85 .",
    "the outburst , as observed in the optical , exhibited a plateau with a duration of about two months and reached an absolute peak magnitude of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations indicated that this was neither a classical nova nor a sub - luminous supernova . instead , its early - time spectrum was consistent with a black body of @xmath8 with narrow h@xmath9 and h@xmath10 emission . following the plateau - phase ,",
    "the optical brightness decreased rapidly and the peak emission evolved towards longer wavelengths .",
    "a similar evolution has been observed in three other transients so far ; m31rv in andromeda @xcite and probably v4332  sgr @xcite and the extensively studied v838  mon  @xcite in the milky way . among this small group",
    ", m85ot2006 - 1  stands out as the most distant and brightest event approaching a bolometric peak luminosity of about @xmath11 .    while the peak luminosities of the four sources differ , their overall observed properties are indicative of a common eruption mechanism .",
    "thus , they were suggested to be the first members of an emerging class of eruptive transients which was recently dubbed _ luminous red novae _ ( lrne ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cause of the peculiar outbursts still needs to be fully established , although various explanations were proposed .",
    "the most favorable scenarios appear to be a stellar merger event in a binary system with small secondary - to - primary mass ratio @xcite or a planetary capture @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of m31  rv and v838  mon  was a strong infrared excess which developed a few months after the eruption @xcite .",
    "this excess emission is commonly associated with condensation of newly formed dust in the expelled envelope around the progenitor star . in this paper",
    "we present the results of a near and mid - infrared search for a similar component in m85ot2006 - 1 .",
    "we observed m85ot2006 - 1  using the _ spitzer space telescope _ infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8@xmath1 m and the peak - up imaging mode of the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 15.8 and 22@xmath1 m in july 2006 .",
    "see table  [ tab : log ] for a summary of observations .",
    "standard pipeline post - basic - calibrated - data products were obtained from the _ spitzer _ archive .",
    "a color - composite of the 3.6 , 5.8 and 8@xmath1 m emission is shown in figure  [ fig : rgb ] ( left ) . prior to undertaking photometry we subtracted the local host galaxy emission estimated using the iraf task _ mkskycor _ ( figure  [ fig : rgb ] right ) .",
    "the flux densities are measured through @xmath12 and @xmath13 apertures for irac and irs , respectively .",
    "aperture corrections were applied according to documented values . see table  [ tab : log ] for a summary of flux densities and apparent magnitudes .",
    "in addition , we obtained simultaneous @xmath14-band imaging with the keck observatory near infrared camera ( nirc ; * ? ? ? * ) under excellent ( fwhm=04 ) conditions .",
    "the data were reduced using the near - infrared processing package _ irtools _ for iraf ( d. thompson , private communication ) .",
    "the host galaxy emission was subtracted as described above and the flux calibration was derived using observations of the standard star sj  9145 @xcite .",
    "the flux measurement was obtained using a circular aperture of @xmath15 radius .",
    "in figure  [ fig : lc ] we show the @xmath14-band light curve combining the photometry from @xcite with the nirc observation presented here .",
    "the sparse data are consistent with a linear decay at a rate of @xmath16mag per day followed by a flattening at about 120@xmath0180days .",
    "the 2.1 to 22@xmath1 m photometry at @xmath17180days is consistent with a black body with effective temperature , @xmath18k ( @xmath19 ; solid line in figure  [ fig : sed ] ) . a fit to the irac and irs data alone suggests a slightly lower temperature , @xmath20k ( @xmath21 ; dashed line in figure  [ fig : sed ] ) and an additional , hotter component leading to a flux surplus at 2.1@xmath1 m . for the following discussion we will assume a black body temperature of @xmath2k for the infrared excess emission .",
    "the bolometric luminosity after 180days ( as traced by @xmath22 ) was @xmath3  ( see table  [ tab : bb ] ) .",
    "the corresponding black body radius was @xmath23^{1/2}=2.0_{-0.4}^{+0.6}\\times10 ^ 4 $ ] . using 2006 january 7 as the onset of the eruption",
    ", we estimate a mean expansion velocity of @xmath24 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the total emitted radiation energy is @xmath25erg , dominated by the optical plateau during the first three months .",
    "we have presented the discovery of a strong 3.622@xmath1 m excess in m85ot2006 - 1  at @xmath17180days .",
    "this thermal infrared component suggests dust condensation in the matter expelled during the eruption , similar to m31  rv @xcite and v838  mon   + @xcite .",
    "the derived photospheric properties of m85ot2006 - 1  are resembled closest by those of m31  rv . for the latter a 1000k dust shell with a radius of @xmath26",
    "was reported after 70days ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see table  [ tab : bb ] for a comparison ) .",
    "similar to m85ot2006 - 1 , m31  rv showed a nearly perfect black body component with only a faint excess at shorter wavelengths .",
    "also v838  mon  displayed a single - component black body emission during the first 120days ( cf .",
    "at this time it s effective temperature , @xmath27k , and radius , @xmath28 , differed significantly from those of m85ot2006 - 1  and m31  rv , though .",
    "however , v838  mon  was initially hotter ( @xmath29k ) and exhibited at least two eruption phases @xcite .",
    "furthermore it resides possibly in a binary with a bright b3 v star @xcite , making the interpretation of the observed quantities difficult .    assuming a spherical geometry for m85ot2006 - 1 , we inferred a mean expansion velocity of @xmath30 km s@xmath6 in june 2006 .",
    "this value is surprisingly similar to the one derived for m31  rv at comparable @xmath31 ( @xmath32 km s@xmath6 , see table  [ tab : bb ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath33 km s@xmath6 in m85ot2006 - 1  is significantly larger than the velocity obtained from the h@xmath9 line width in february 2006 ( @xmath34 km s@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "a solution to this apparent discrepancy lies in the source geometry . in case of an a - spherical expansion ,",
    "e.g. an oblate geometry observed face - on , the velocity ( @xmath35 black body radius ) , may be overestimated .",
    "alternatively , the large velocity inferred from the infrared observations , can be caused by radiative acceleration as a result of a long lasting engine activity or multiple phases of energy injection into the expanding material .",
    "furthermore , the balmer emission may have originated in a low velocity region unrelated to the matter which produced the late time black body component .    in v838",
    "mon   the shell became partly transparent after @xmath17120days .",
    "furthermore , the temperature slowly increased again after @xmath17250days , possibly as the result of a gravitationally induced collapse of the inflated envelope @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior was also reported for v4332  sgr about nine years after its eruption @xcite .",
    "whether or not m85ot2006 - 1  will evolve alike , needs to be addressed with future infrared observations .",
    "most of our knowledge on lrne prior to our analysis was based on detailed studies of a single event , v838  mon .",
    "here we have shown that variations in the infrared evolution exists among the small sample of sources .",
    "whether the cause of these variations lies in the progenitor , environment or some other unnamed parameter remains to be solved .",
    "indeed , already the underlying stellar populations are not uniform . while v838  mon  resides within a b - star cluster @xcite , m85ot2006 - 1  @xcite , m31  rv @xcite and v4332  sgr @xcite probably originated from low - mass stars .",
    "however , it is clearly premature to speculate on a possible bimodality here .    the next step forward requires a significant increase of the lrne sample .",
    "estimates based on the few known events suggest rates of approx .",
    "a dozen per year out to a distance of 20mpc @xcite .",
    "similar predictions come from the theory of violent mergers of both massive and low mass stars @xcite .",
    "thus , a dedicated search for lrne is expected to net a substantial number of new events and may revolutionize our understanding of these elusive transients .    a promising strategy to detect new lrne similar to m85ot2006 - 1  and m31  rv is to make use of their characteristic infrared emission properties .",
    "the irac colors of a @xmath36k black body can easily be discriminated from the majority of known stellar objects , agn and unresolved galaxies ( figure  [ fig : cc ] left ) . only early - type t - dwarfs ( t2t4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which have similar @xmath31 , exhibit comparable 3.6@xmath08@xmath1 m colors .",
    "however , the latter can be identified by their strong molecular absorption bands in the near - infrared ( e.g. , ch@xmath37 , h@xmath380 ; for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which also lead to significant deviations from a perfect black body spectrum ( offset from black body line in figure  [ fig : cc]).o , co , oh , sh ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) after @xmath39year together with a hot continuum ( @xmath40k ) inconsistent with a simple black body .",
    "thus , it would have been difficult to identify by its infrared colors alone .",
    "whether this is caused by intrinsic or environmental differences with respect to m85ot2006 - 1  and m31  rv or only the result of a slower evolution is unconstrained . ]",
    "the main advantage of searching in the infrared is that the detection probability is increased with respect to optical searches by the ratio of infrared - bright time ( a few years ) to optical plateau duration ( a few months ) . using the predictions of @xcite of approx .",
    "one lrn per galaxy every 10 - 50 years , we can estimate the number of anticipated events in an existing sample like the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ; * ? ? ?",
    ". sings comprises irac observations of 75 galaxies within 30mpc ( mean distance 9.5mpc ) with sensitivities similar to the observations presented here .",
    "we predict that a search in the archival data using the described color criterion might lead to the detection of as much as 1 - 10 new lrn events . a similar number of events could be found in a large survey of nearby galaxies using the deep imaging mode of _ akari _ ( _",
    "astro - f _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "we close the paper by emphasizing that the search for stellar mergers can be expected to have a substantial impact over the next years .",
    "similar to the history of the field of gamma - ray bursts , a large increase of well studied events is anticipated to lead to exciting new insights into this emerging family of enigmatic transients .",
