    "quantum coherence , another embodiment of the superposition principle of states , is essential for many distinctive and captivating characteristics of quantum systems [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "the quantification of of quantum coherence was recently proposed by baumgratz _",
    "under this framework , many new coherence quantifiers have been presented since then [ 5 - 8 ] . meanwhile ,",
    "various properties of quantum coherence have been investigated such as the connections between quantum coherence and quantum correlations [ 9 - 14 ] , the distillation of coherence [ 15 - 17 ] , the dynamics under noisy evolution of quantum coherence [ 18,19 ] , among others . the role of coherence in biological system [ 20 ] , and thermodynamics [ 21 ] has also been explored . _    in the framework of coherence given by baumgratz _",
    "et al . , let @xmath1 be some fixed reference basis ( incoherent basis ) in the finite dimensional hilbert space , and a state is said to be incoherent if it is diagonal in this basis , being of the form @xmath2 .",
    "a quantum operation is identified by a set of kraus operators @xmath3 satisfying @xmath4 .",
    "specially , a quantum operation is called incoherent if it can be written in the form @xmath5 , with incoherent kraus operators @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are elements of the fixed reference basis . as a quantifier of quantum coherence",
    ", we will use the relative entropy of coherence , initially defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the quantum relative entropy [ 22 ] and the minimization is taken over the set of all incoherent states @xmath12 .",
    "crucially , the relative entropy of coherence can be evaluate exactly : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the von neumann entropy [ 22 ] and @xmath15 denotes the von neumann measurement ( dephasing operation ) of @xmath16 with respect to the fixed reference basis .",
    "an important progress within the resource theory of coherence is the operational theory of coherence , which is introduced by winter and yang [ 15 ] .",
    "particularly , they presented the distillable coherence for any state @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 , where the distillable coherence @xmath18 is defined as the maximal rate for extracting maximally coherent single - qubit states , @xmath19 , from a given state @xmath16 via incoherence operations . _",
    "for a bipartite system @xmath20 shared by alice and bob , its reference basis is usually assumed to be the tenser product basis of local bases [ 6 ] , i.e. , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the fixed reference bases of subsystems @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . in the task of assisted coherence distillation",
    "[ 16 , 17 ] , two parties , namely alice and bob , share many copies of some bipartite state @xmath26 in system @xmath20 and their goal is to maximize coherence on bob s subsystem via special operations .",
    "the task of assisted coherence distillation via local quantum - incoherent operations and classical communication ( lqicc ) was firstly introduced in ref . [ 16 ] .",
    "then , streltsov _ et al . further studied the assisted coherence distillation via the set of operations @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is either local incoherent operations and classical communication ( licc ) , lqicc , separable incoherent operations ( si ) , or separable quantum - incoherent operations ( sqi ) . in these sets of operations",
    ", bob is restricted to just incoherent operations on his subsystem , since they do not allow for local creation of coherence on bob s side .",
    "the corresponding distillable coherence on bob s side is denoted by @xmath27 and can be given as follows [ 17 ] : @xmath28-\\psi_{2}^{\\otimes \\lfloor rn\\rfloor}\\|)=0\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the largest integer below or equal to @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a maximally coherent single - qubit state on bob s side . for any bipartite state @xmath26 , the distillable coherence @xmath32 is upper bounded by the qi relative entropy @xmath33 , where the minimization is taken over the set of all quantum - incoherent states @xmath34 [ 17 ] .",
    "quite remarkably , both sets of operations sqi and si lead to the same maximal performance for all states in the task of assisted coherence distillation . besides , for all pure states and maximally correlated states in the incoherent basis , all the sets of operations we consider are always equivalent in this task and the distillable coherence can reach the upper bound , namely qi relative entropy . however , we do not know whether the sets of operations such as licc , lqicc and si ( sqi ) are equivalent in this task and whether the distillable coherence can reach the upper bound for general mixed states .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we will investigate the assisted coherence distillation of two special classes of mixed states .",
    "the results suggest that there exist states , namely werner states , whose distillable coherence can not reach the upper bound via the set of operations @xmath0 we consider here . _",
    "in the following we discuss the scenario where the state shared by alice and bob has vanished basis - dependent discord [ 23 ] . in this section , we will frequently refer to a bipartite system @xmath20 , and without other stated , we use @xmath22 and @xmath23 as the fixed reference bases of subsystems @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "before we study this work , we recall the condition of states with vanished basis - dependent discord as follows .    * lemma 1*. ( yadin _ et al . )",
    "let @xmath35 be the von neumann measurement with respect to the fixed reference basis @xmath23 of subsystem @xmath25 .",
    "for any given state @xmath26 in system @xmath20 , let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be the reduced states of @xmath26 on subsystem @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . then , its basis - dependent discord @xmath38 is zero , i.e. @xmath39 , if and only if there exists a decomposition of @xmath40 , @xmath41 such that @xmath42 are perfectly distinguishable by projective measurements in the fixed reference basis @xmath43 .",
    "_    it is well known that coherence is a basis - dependent measure of quantumness in single systems , and similarly , @xmath44 can be seen as a basis - dependent measure of quantumness of correlation [ 23 ] . from the lemma 1 , we know that the states with vanished basis - dependent discord are special separable states whose @xmath42 have disjoint coherence support .",
    "another important result we will refer to is the following lemma 2 which is about the distillable coherence @xmath27 via the set of operations @xmath0 we consider here .    * lemma 2*. ( streltsov _ et al . ) for an arbitrary bipartite state @xmath45 in system @xmath20 , the following inequality holds : @xmath46 _    lemma 2 presents the power of all the sets of operations such as licc , lqicc , si and sqi in the task of assisted coherence distillation for an arbitrary bipartite state .",
    "equipped with these results , we are now in position to prove the following theorem .    * theorem 3*. for any bipartite state @xmath45 given in eq.@xmath47 , the following equality holds : @xmath48 where @xmath37 is the reduced state of @xmath26 on subsystem @xmath25 .",
    "* proof*. note that the qi relative entropy of any bipartite state @xmath16 can be evaluated exactly [ 16 ] : @xmath49 where @xmath35 is the von neumann measurement in the fixed reference basis @xmath23 and @xmath50 is the basis - dependent discord as given in lemma 1 . combining eq . @xmath51 and eq .",
    "@xmath52 in lemma 2 , we get the inequality @xmath53 besides , it is straightforward that @xmath54 , where @xmath0 is either licc , lqicc , si or sqi . according to lemma 1 , for any bipartite state @xmath45 given in eq.@xmath47 , its basis - dependent discord @xmath50 is equal to zero .",
    "applying eq . @xmath55 and combing the aforementioned results we arrive at the desired equality given in eq .",
    "@xmath56 .    from theorem 3",
    ", we obtain that for all states with vanished ( incoherent ) basis - dependent discord , there does not exist basis - dependent quantum correlation between alice and bob to help bob improve his distillable coherence .",
    "however , we do not know whether the necessity of theorem 3 is true . in other words ,",
    "if the distillable coherence @xmath32 via the set of operations @xmath0 , is equal to the relative entropy of coherence @xmath57 , does the state @xmath26 has the form given in eq .",
    "@xmath47 ? however , as will see in the next section , the distillable coherence of a werner state can not reach the upper bound and it means that the basis - dependent discord @xmath38 of a werner state can not be completely transformed into the coherence on bob s side via the set of operations @xmath0 we consider here .",
    "here , we consider assisted coherence of distillation for the werner states of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the bell state denoted as @xmath61 ( or other bell states [ 22 ] ) . here",
    "@xmath62 is the identity operator on the composite system or on the marginal systems , depending on the context .",
    "for the two - qubit system , we choose the computable basis as the fixed reference basis of each subsystem . in this case , the reduced state of bob @xmath37 is incoherent and @xmath63",
    ". then , the distillable coherence of bob via the set of operations @xmath0 comes from the basis - dependent quantum correlation between alice and bob .",
    "moreover , in the following theorem we show that the distillable coherence for a werner state can not reach the upper bound , namely qi relative entropy and in this case all sets of operations we consider here are equivalent for assisted coherence distillation .",
    "* theorem 4*. for any werner state @xmath45 given in eq .",
    "@xmath64 , the following inequality holds : @xmath65    * proof*. in the first step of the proof we show that for any werner state @xmath26 , its distillable coherence @xmath66 is strictly less than its qi relative entropy @xmath67 . by direct calculations , the qi relative entropy of the werner state @xmath26 is @xmath68 where @xmath59 .",
    "next , let alice use x basis to measure her subsystem . if the result of alice s measurement is @xmath69 , the post - measurement state of bob is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a maximally coherent single - qubit state , and in this case bob does not need to do anything .",
    "if the result of alice s measurement is @xmath72 , alice informs bob her result and bob performs the incoherent z gate @xmath73 on his subsystem to obtain the state with the form given in eq .",
    "@xmath74 . repeat this process , and bob obtains many copies of @xmath75 .",
    "then , the distillable coherence of bob via this lqicc protocol is @xmath76    consequently , we show the fact that @xmath77 is the largest distillable coherence of bob assisted by alice through all lqicc protocols .",
    "suppose that alice performs a local quantum measurement @xmath78 on her subsystem , and informs bob her results . according to the results of alice",
    ", bob performs the incoherent unitary operations on his subsystem , and then the state on bob s side can be denoted as @xmath79 with the convexity of the relative entropy of coherence [ 4 ] , we only need to consider the case that @xmath80 is a pure state , which can be written in the bloch representation , @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are real and satisfy the equation @xmath84 in this case , direct calculations show that @xmath85 examine the maximum value of @xmath86 under the constraint condition eq .",
    "@xmath87 , and we obtain the maximum value @xmath88 at @xmath89 and @xmath90 . then , it follows that @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , for the werner state @xmath26 , it holds that @xmath92 .",
    "now , we show that @xmath88 is strictly less than the upper bound @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath93 subtract eq . @xmath94 and",
    "the difference is denoted as @xmath95 with @xmath59 .",
    "note that @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "then , @xmath98 is strictly convex for all @xmath99 and strictly concave for all @xmath100 . besides , using @xmath101 , we get the minimum value at @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , we obtain that @xmath103 for all @xmath59 and plot the function @xmath98 in fig . @xmath69 and fig .",
    "@xmath104 , which highlights the distillable coherence @xmath77 via the set of operations @xmath0 is strictly less than the upper bound , namely qi relative entropy for any werner state given in eq .",
    "@xmath64 .     which is the difference between the qi relative entropy and the distillable coherence via lqicc for any werner state given in eq .",
    "]     given in eq .",
    "@xmath64 in the task of assisted coherence distillation .",
    "we plot the distillable coherence @xmath77 ( the black line ) , the upper bound @xmath67 ( the dashed line ) , and the function @xmath98 given in eq . @xmath105",
    "( the red line ) . ]",
    "finally , we show that for the werner state @xmath106 , the distillable coherence of bob is also equal to @xmath88 via other sets of operations such as sqi , si and licc . since lqicc is a subset of sqi and si , the similar approach as above leads to the equality : @xmath107 in order to prove that @xmath108 , we present a licc protocol achieving the rate @xmath77 .",
    "let alice perform an erasing ( incoherent ) measurement on her subsystem [ 24 ] , whose kraus operators are @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "if the result of alice s measurement is 1 , bob s post - measurement state is @xmath111 .",
    "in this case , bob can get the state @xmath75 by applying first an x gate @xmath112 and then an incoherent unitary gate @xmath113 to @xmath114 .",
    "if the result of alice s measurement is 2 , bob s post - measurement state is @xmath115 , and then bob can get @xmath75 by applying first an x gate @xmath112 and then a phase gate @xmath116 to @xmath117 . therefore , via licc , the distillable coherence of bob is @xmath77 with the similar arguments as above .",
    "these results imply the inequality given in eq .",
    "@xmath118 .    note that for standard coherence distillation the relative entropy coherence is in fact equal to the optimal distillation rate [ 15 ] . in the task of assisted coherence distillation via the set of operations @xmath0 , the qi relative entropy @xmath119 is an upper bound on @xmath27 [ 16 , 17 ] .",
    "however , by theorem 4 , we know that the distillation coherence @xmath27 is not always able to reach the upper bound , namely qi relative entropy .",
    "it is surprising that for a werner state @xmath26 given in eq .",
    "@xmath64 the distillable coherence @xmath32 does not depend on the particular set of operations performed by alice and bob .",
    "in particular , in this case the optimal distillation rate can already be obtained by the weakest set of operations licc .",
    "the other sets of operations , such as lqicc , sqi , and si , can not provide any advantage to improve the distillable coherence on bob s side . through the above results",
    ", we strongly conjecture that all the sets of operations we consider here are equivalent in the task of assisted coherence distillation for any mixed state and we leave this question open for further study .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the assisted coherence distillation of some mixed states , such as the states with vanished ( incoherent ) basis - dependent discord and werner states , via the set of operations @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is either licc , lqicc , si or sqi . for these mixed states , all sets of operations we consider here are equivalent for assisted coherence distillation . in particular , we have provided a sufficient condition such that alice s assistance via the set of operations @xmath0 can not help bob improve his distillable coherence , and the condition is that the state shared by alice and bob has vanished basis - dependent discord .",
    "moreover , we have proved that the distillable coherence of a werner state via the set of operations @xmath0 can not reach the upper bound , namely qi relative entropy .",
    "this result suggest that there exist a state for example the werner state whose distillable coherence is not its qi relative entropy , even through the largest set of operations sqi .",
    "we hope that our work helps to well understand the resource theory of coherence in distributed scenarios .",
