    "the peculiar galaxy in the cluster was among the first to be recognized as a powerful source of radio emission .",
    "more than 40 years ago , @xcite argued that since radio galaxies such as typically have symmetric lobes , the jets which feed the radio lobes are likely to be intrinsically two - sided , but that they would appear one - sided due to differential relativistic doppler beaming .",
    "this simple picture is now widely accepted as the basis of unified models , which try to explain many of the different properties of agn as due to relativistic beaming and projection effects , rather than to intrinsic differences ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "m87 remains of great interest today , since there is strong observational evidence for a @xmath0 @xmath1 black hole located at the galactic nucleus thought to power the relativistic jet @xcite .",
    "moreover , at a distance of only 16  mpc , ( 1  mas = 0.08  pc ; 1  mas per year @xmath2 ) m87 is one of the closest radio galaxies , and as such it has one of the few jets which can be well - resolved on sub - parsec scales in a direction transverse to the flow .",
    "the m87 jet has been studied over a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum , including imaging with hst @xcite and the vla @xcite as well as with chandra @xcite .",
    "the observed morphology at radio , optical , and even x - ray wavelengths appears very similar , suggesting a common synchrotron radiation mechanism at all wavelengths and a common spectral index of @xmath3 throughout the jet @xcite . at least at optical and x - ray wavelengths ,",
    "the electron lifetime down the jet is much shorter than the travel time from the nucleus , suggesting continual in situ acceleration of relativistic particles within the jet @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report on observations made with the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) at 2  cm wavelength .",
    "high dynamic range images constructed from observations made in the year 2000 describe the two - dimensional structure of the jet out to nearly 0.2  arcsec ( 16  pc ) and show the presence of a faint counter - feature .",
    "these observations were complemented by regular observations made with lower sensitivity between 1995 and 2007 to study the outward flow within the inner part of the radio jet .",
    "m87 has been regularly observed with the vlba since 1995 as part of the 2  cm vlba survey @xcite and the more recent program @xcite . in these programs , at each epoch we observed each source for a total of about one hour , with multiple observations spaced over a wide range of hour angle . for m87",
    ", we have obtained a total of 21 images between 1995 and 2007 .",
    "typically the rms noise in each image is about 0.3  mjybeam@xmath4 .",
    "as described in more detail by @xcite and @xcite , for each epoch , the data were calibrated using aips and imaged with difmap .",
    "the location of each bright feature was fitted in the visibility plane .",
    "we have supplemented these multiple epoch images using vlba 2  cm archive data from observations made at three epochs in 2000 ( 22  january , 8  may , 30  december ) .",
    "these later observations included one vla antenna and were made with full tracks in hour angle each lasting about 10 hours using 2-bit recording at a 256  mbps data rate , allowing us to reach the thermal noise level of less than 70  @xmath5jybeam@xmath4 .",
    "as a check on the robustness of the weak features seen in these high dynamic range images , different authors independently made images using difmap and aips respectively and obtained very similar results . in addition , to verify the reality of faint `` counter - feature '' reported in  [ s : structure ] , one of us generated three artificial datasets of m87 .",
    "these model datasets were based on the structure of m87 which was observed on 2000  may  8 .",
    "they used the identical ( @xmath6,@xmath7)-coverage of that epoch and contained a comparable level of random noise .",
    "one of the models contained an extended counter - feature totaling nearly 40  mjy , and two did not .",
    "all three model datasets were independently self - calibrated and imaged by another one of us without any prior communication about which models contained the counter - feature .",
    "the image maker was able to correctly identify the data with the counter - feature and correctly determined its flux density and extended structure .",
    "no counter - feature was found in the derived image down to the noise level from the other two datasets without the counter - feature .",
    "given the results of these trials , and the presence of the counter - feature in all three observed full - track vlba images as well as in the 20 lower sensetivity 2  cm survey / images , we are confident that the observed counter - feature is real and that there are no significant artifacts in our image created by the imaging process .",
    "in figure  [ f : m87_vlba ] , we show the 2  cm image constructed from observations made with the vlba plus 1 vla antenna .",
    "a tapered image made with twice the beam size from the same data shows structure out to nearly 0.2  arcsec . as seen in figure  [",
    "f : m87_vlba ] , the jet appears bifurcated , starting at about 5 mas ( 0.4  pc ) from the core , characteristic of a single limb brightened cylindrical or conical jet .",
    "the m87 jet appears to be highly collimated , with re - collimation observed between 2  pc where the opening angle is about @xmath8 , and 12  pc where the opening angle is only @xmath9 to @xmath10 . as discussed in ",
    "[ s : obs ] , figure  [ f : m87_vlba ] also shows the existence of weak structure extending away from the bright core toward the southeast .",
    "indications of this counter feature were first suggested by @xcite on the basis of their 7 mm vlba observations .",
    "this counter - feature also appears clearly bifurcated but is weaker than the main jet by a factor of 10 to 15 close to the core and is only traced out to 3.1  mas from the core . between 3.1 and 6  mas away ,",
    "this feature is weaker than the jet by at least a factor of 200 .    for several reasons we believe that the eastern extension may be the counter - jet .",
    "based on their higher resolution 7  mm image , @xcite have also detected the counter feature and have argued that the true base of the jet can not be offset by more than 2  mas from the bright core ; whereas we have detected the counter - feature to be at least 3.1  mas long .",
    "also , we note strong circular polarization at a fractional level of @xmath11 was detected at 2  cm by @xcite coincident with the flux density peak , suggesting that this region of the jet has an optical depth near unity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) which is characteristic of jet cores . keeping in mind that there is possible ambiguity in the vlbi image alignment , @xcite have measured the spectral index between 8  ghz and 12  ghz for the region with the peak intensity to be @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) consistent with an optically thick nucleus . since the surface brightness of the eastern feature is more than 200 times fainter than the one of the brightest feature which we have identified with the core , it seems unlikely that it could be the actual core .",
    "however , considering that no other radio jet has been observed with comparable linear resolution , sensitivity , and dynamic range , we can not exclude the possibility that we are seeing the detailed structure of the optically thick core of the jet , and that the counter - jet itself is not detected .",
    "lccrrr c7 & 0.43 & 0.1 & 111.2 & @xmath14  & @xmath15 + c6 & 0.43 & 0.1 & 279.2 & @xmath16  & @xmath17 + c5 & 1.4 & 0.2 & 283.8 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 + c4 & 2.8 & 0.3 & 283.5 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 + c3 & 6.4 & 0.5 & 282.8 & @xmath22 & @xmath23 + c2 & 13 & 1.3 & 286.6 & @xmath24 & @xmath25   + c1 & 21 & 1.1 & 290.0 & @xmath26 & @xmath27   +    hst observations of the m87 jet made between 1994 and 1998 by @xcite have suggested superluminal speeds up to about @xmath28 in a region approximately 6  arcsec ( 0.5  kpc ) downstream of the central agn , consistent with what might be expected from doppler boosting of this highly asymmetric jet .",
    "the feature , known as hst-1 , is located 0.86 arcsec from the base of the jet , and was more recently observed by chandra and hst to vary dramatically at both x - ray and optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "it was found to have apparent superluminal speeds up to @xmath29 in 20  cm vlba experiment by @xcite .",
    "however , within 1  arcsec of the nucleus ( 80  pc ) , using hst , @xcite measured much slower speeds between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    at radio wavelengths ,",
    "@xcite reported vla observations which showed a typical speed of about @xmath32 but ranging up to @xmath33 at distances up to about 20  arcsec ( 1.6  kpc ) from the nucleus .",
    "however , previous vlba observations @xcite and vsop ( vlba to halca ) observations @xcite found no evidence of motions within 5  pc of the core , although @xcite reported an observed velocity of @xmath34 for a feature located about 20  mas ( 1.6  pc ) from the nucleus .",
    "more recently , based on just two of five total epochs , @xcite reported possible speeds between @xmath35 and @xmath36 for three transient features located about 3  mas ( 0.24  pc ) from the nucleus .",
    "we find no evidence for motions faster than @xmath37 within the inner 20 mas ( 1.6  pc ) . in figure",
    "[ f : speed ] we plot the location of seven separate jet features as a function of time , and we summarize their speeds in table  [ t : kinematics ] .",
    "all the jet components were fit with circular gaussians .",
    "the fastest jet speed observed is only @xmath38 , while the counter - jet feature apparently moves outward at @xmath39 .",
    "the other five features appear essentially stationary over the twelve years that they have been observed , with nominal upper limits to their speed of about @xmath37 .",
    "each feature was detected at 17 to 24 separate epochs .",
    "given that much faster speeds , up to @xmath28 , have been observed in the arcsecond scale jet , it is important to consider the possibility of temporal under - sampling in our kinematic analysis of the milli - arcsecond scale jet , where @xmath28 would correspond to @xmath40  masyr@xmath4 .",
    "our vlba sampling interval ranged from 2 to 8  months , with a median of 5  months . a newly ejected , fast component",
    "could therefore conceivably travel anywhere between 2 to 16  mas downstream in the time between successive epochs , possibly leading to an incorrect component cross - identification in figure  [ f : speed ] .",
    "however , the large number of jet components present at each epoch implies that if they have very fast speeds , new components would have to be emitted very frequently from the core region , at a rate of @xmath41 per year .",
    "but , the flux density and brightness temperature of the core show no indication of such activity , but instead vary relatively smoothly over time .",
    "second , there are clear gaps in jet brightness between 3 and 5  mas and between 6 and 10  mas ( see figure  [ f : speed ] and the movie in the electronic edition of the journal ) in which jet components are never present at any epoch   a highly unlikely situation given a high component ejection rate .",
    "third , the brightness temperatures of the individual components c1 to c7 are consistent across the epochs , which would not be expected if our cross - identifications were incorrect .",
    "finally , our 2  cm vlba movie of the jet , which relies on simple linear interpolation across the epochs , shows no sudden jumps that would be indicative of temporal under - sampling .",
    "we believe that this interpretation is more robust than the results of other radio measurements which typically used only two or three epochs .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility of a smooth relativistic flow with no propagating shocks or other patterns .",
    "considering that the doppler boosted relativistic jet of m87 appears one - sided out to kiloparsec scales , the absence of any clear motions in the inner jet is somewhat surprising .",
    "we measure a jet to counter - jet flux density ratio of between 10 and 15 ( in the year 2000 ) at a position between 0.5 and 3.1 mas from the core , and a lower limit of 200 between 3.1 to 6.0  mas away . assuming that the jet is intrinsically bidirectional and symmetric , and that the bulk velocity flow is the same as the pattern motion ,",
    "our maximum reliable observed speed of @xmath42 would imply a jet to counter - jet ratio near unity for the commonly accepted viewing angle of @xmath43 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the jet and counter - jet are intrinsically symmetric and oriented at an angle of @xmath44 to @xmath45 to the line of sight , the observed jet to counter - jet flux density ratios imply that the intrinsic flow speed , @xmath46 , is 0.5 to 0.6 between 0 and 3.1  mas from the core and increases to @xmath470.9 beyond 3.1  mas . also , we note that the rather small ratio of observed jet to counter - jet speeds ( table  [ t : kinematics ] ) of less than 2.5 is not consistent with simple relativistic beaming models .",
    "we conclude that either the inner jet is intrinsically asymmetric , or there are no detectable moving features within a rapidly flowing plasma .",
    "apparent limb brightening is predicted from analytic and numerical modeling of relativistic jets @xcite and can be reproduced via kelvin - helmholtz instability , which is seen in extragalactic jets both at kiloparsec ( m87 , * ? ? ? * ) and parsec scales ( 3c273 , * ? ? ?",
    "limb brightening can be particularly pronounced when the jet opening angle is greater than the beaming angle @xcite and especially if there is a velocity gradient across the jet @xcite .",
    "a two layer `` spine - sheath '' model has been suggested to explain the existence of observed strong tev emission from bl  lacs with apparently slow moving radio jets @xcite . @xcite and @xcite have considered a two component jet having a fast spine which produces the gamma ray emission by inverse compton scattering of the radio photons from a surrounding slow layer or sheath .",
    "spine - sheath models have also been discussed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the central gap seen in our vlba images of m87 , as well as observed tev emission ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and as discussed above ) combined with the lack of measurable motion within the inner 1.6  pc (  [ s : kinematics ] ) appear to support this two component model .",
    "the recently reported detection of strong variable tev emission from m87 @xcite also presents a problem , since unless the radiating plasma has a large doppler factor , energy losses due to @xmath48 pair production will extinguish the gamma ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although we do not find any evidence for a fast moving jet in m87 close to the central engine , the observed tev emission can be explained in terms of a dual layer model with a fast inner jet and a slower moving outer layer @xcite . in this picture , the inner jet is beamed away from us and is thus not seen in our vlba images , and we only observe the slower outer layer .",
    "however , even the slow outer layer must move at at  least @xmath490.8 to be consistent with the jet to counter - jet flux density ratio as discussed earlier in this section .",
    "@xcite argue that the superluminal feature hst-1 , located at a de - projected distance of more than 100  pc down the jet , may be the source of tev emission in m87 , rather than the base of the jet . by analogy",
    ", they suggest that blazar activity more broadly may not , as is widely assumed , be located close to the central engine .",
    "if this is the case , we might expect to observe small - scale structure in hst-1 at 2  cm , but we do not find any milliarcsecond structure stronger than 0.75  mjy in that region in the 2000 full - track vlba data ; however our data were taken five years before the hst-1 flaring event in 2005 .",
    "@xcite commented that an origin of the tev emission in hst-1 would imply an unrealistically small opening angle for the energy source , assuming the source was located at the base of the jet .",
