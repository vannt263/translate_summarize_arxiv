    "energy measurements of giant air showers demonstrated the existence of a distinctive structure , the @xmath4 , in the differential energy spectrum of the cosmic radiation above @xmath10 .",
    "figure 1 shows the energy spectrum measured by four experiments [ 1,2,3,4 ] at these extreme energies .",
    "cosmic ray intensity does not continue to decrease with a spectral index between 3 and 3.2 , observed between @xmath11 and @xmath10 , but an enhancement of the intensity above @xmath3 @xmath2 appears in all experiments .",
    "this enhancement is relative to the extrapolation at high energy with the index of 3 measured at lower energy , below @xmath12 @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath4 is the distinctive pattern in the spectrum consisting of a minimum of intensity followed by an enhancement observable approximately in the energy band @xmath3-@xmath13 .",
    "the energy at which this enhancement occurs , and its magnitude , of this enhancement do not coincide in different experiments , though precise measurements of the minimum are available from the hires collaboration [ 4,5 ] .",
    "this contribution to the cris conference 2006 follows recent studies [ 6,7 ] ( hereafter paper i and ii , respectively ) reporting a quantitative solution of the long - standing problem of the knee and ankle of the cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "a notable aspect of this solution is that the same mechanisms are responsable for the ankles and the knees of the individual ions .",
    "even purposely it would be impossible to separate the explanation of the ankle from that of the knee .",
    "the intrinsic mechanisms generating the ankles do not depend on the spectral indices of the cosmic rays at the sources nor on any extragalactic component of the cosmic radiation , but is an intrinsic property of the galactic cosmic rays ( sections 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the extragalactic component , if any at the earth around @xmath9 @xmath2 , might add to the galactic component , affecting the magnitude of the ankle , but its necessity and its experimental evidence remain unproved ( section 7 ) .",
    "note that the expected gzk depression or its absence [ 3 ] is beyond the energy band pertinent for the explanation of the ankles presented here .",
    "the method of calculation , used for over a decade , reconstructs ion trajectories by computer simulations and evaluates physical quantities of cosmic rays ( intensities , energy spectra , ion ratios etc ) using the number of trajectories intercepting a given small volume in the galaxy which in the present calculation can be the earth ( also @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 or @xmath17 @xmath18 ) , a sphere concentric to the earth , or the entire disc volume ( section 9 ) .",
    "the computational algorithms , described elsewhere [ 8,9,10 ] take into account the following astronomical , astrophysical and radioastronomy observations : ( 1 ) the spiral magnetic field ; ( 2 ) the field strength ( see figure 3 paper i ) of the spiral magnetic field ; ( 3 ) a chaotic magnetic field with a field strength of about three times that of the regular field ; ( 4 ) the form and the dimension of the galaxy ( see figure 1 in ref.[9 ] ) ; ( 5 ) a uniform distribution of cosmic ray sources in the galactic disk ( see eqn.(3 ) in ref.[9 ] ) ; ( 6 ) the nuclear cross sections ion - hydrogen , @xmath19 ; ( 7 ) the interstellar matter density in the disk , @xmath20 , of 1.24 hydrogen atoms per @xmath21 ; ( 8) the position of the @xmath17 @xmath18 inside the disk , at 14 @xmath22 above the galactic midplane and 8.5 @xmath23 from the galactic center ; ( 9 ) the galactic wind ( section 2 in ref.[10 ] ) . prerequisites of this study regarding the notion of @xmath15 @xmath24 [ 11,10 ] have been previously discussed in detail .",
    "a cosmic ion emanated from a source travels , on average , a mean length , @xmath25 , in the disk volume , primarily determined by @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "typically , this global length @xmath25 is subdivided into thousands and thousands of segments , depending on the particular region of propagation and the energy of the cosmic ion .",
    "the ion propagation normal to the regular spiral field is generated by the chaotic field leading to a transverse - to - longitudinal displacement ratio compatible with the quasi - linear theory of ion propagation in an astrophysical environment .",
    "the chaotic or turbulent magnetic field is materialized by magnetic cloudlets ( see , for instance , ref.[12,13 ] ) with variable dimensions and a field strenght three times greater than that of the regular field .",
    "trajectories at low energy are quite different from those at very high energy .",
    "figures 2 and 3 display a typical low energy trajectory .",
    "the differential energy spectrum of the cosmic rays , @xmath26/@xmath27 , depends on the number of cosmic ray trajectories intercepting the local galactic zone , @xmath28 .",
    "figure 4 shows @xmath28 versus energy for helium , taken as an example .",
    "three energy regions of @xmath28 are clearly distinguishable : ( 1 ) a high plateau ; ( 2 ) a rapid descent ; ( 3 ) a low plateau .",
    "the intensity gap between the high and the low plateau is of capital importance to comprehend the origin of the ankle .",
    "this gap depends on the matter thickness encountered by the cosmic helium in the galaxy and on the nuclear cross section helium - hydrogen , @xmath19(he ) .",
    "the form of the spectrum shown in figure 4 is quite general , and simple mechanisms concur in its creation as clarified below .    in the energy band @xmath29-@xmath1",
    "@xmath28 is approximately constant , though slightly decreasing . forcing a power law interpolation on @xmath28 with a constant spectral index , a value of 0.13 for helium results .",
    "this decreasing feature is due to rising cross sections as explained in detail in paper i , sections 3 and 4 . in the high plateau region ,",
    "the indices of @xmath28 for different nuclides tend to decrease with the atomic number .",
    "an elegant derivation of this result is feasible by the notion of @xmath15 @xmath24 [ 10,11 ] .",
    "the second portion of the spectrum , referred to as the knee , is due primarily to the break in the efficiency of the ion bending inherent the galactic magnetic field .",
    "this break has been analyzed in detail elsewhere ( paper i section 4 and paper ii section 5 ) .",
    "the break energy is defined as that particular energy characteristic of a nuclear species , where the bend of @xmath28 occurs and a sharp decrease dominates .",
    "though the effect of the magnetic field on @xmath28 is dominant , the exact form of @xmath28 emerges only after including the position of the solar cavity , the nuclear cross sections and the disc size .",
    "the decrease of the cosmic ray intensity , or equivalently the descent in the bending efficiency and comcomittant effects on @xmath28 of the other parameters , can not continue indefinitely as the energy increases above the break energies .",
    "in fact , the average value of the magnetic field strength is finite ( say , 3 @xmath30 g ) , and because of this finiteness , at some energy , for a specified ion , trajectories remain completely unbent , and consequently , the bending efficiency vanishes .",
    "this condition corresponds to the rectilinear propagation which is at the origin of the @xmath31 as discussed in section 8 .",
    "the existence of the ankle is incubated in the quantity @xmath28 versus energy shown in figure 4 .",
    "subsequent analysis indicates how the low plateau in figure 4 transforms into a physical @xmath4 accessible to experimentation .",
    "figure 5 shows an idealization of the universal spectrum of the cosmic radiation between @xmath29 and @xmath32 @xmath2 .",
    "a notable feature of this spectrum is its linearity in logarithmic scales .",
    "the ankle is a small perturbation of the differential intensity .",
    "in fact the maximum difference between extrapolated and measured intensity is a factor 8 occurring around @xmath33 ( see figure 20 in paper i and the data in ref.[4 ] ) , while in the knee - ankle energy range the differential intensity falls by a round factor @xmath8 , hence the term @xmath34 @xmath35 . a similar conclusion is reached in ref.[15 ] where other empirical arguments are used . the remarkable linearity shown in figure 5 suggests that individual ions may also have approximate linearities . for logical coherence in the explanation of the ankle this linearity",
    "is converted here in a postulate .",
    "notice that this postulate constitutes a useful @xmath36 @xmath37 in the experimental data below @xmath38 and above @xmath39 for a number of reasons [ 16 ] .",
    "also , the quantitative account of the knee and the ankle given here would demand a much softer hypothesis than this powerful postulate .",
    "for instance , only spectral indices in narrow energy bands , before and close the knee , are really useful in the present analysis .",
    "the absence of this postulate does entail other silent hypotheses ( usually unexpressed in the literature ) .",
    "the rejection of the postulate would entail more complex hypotheses , probably with higher arbitrariness .",
    "the experimental data at low energy indicate that spectral indices occasionally are not constant , as reported , for example , by the atic experiment [ 17 ] for a number of ions between @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( c , mg , o , si and probably k ) but a clear spectral break is not experimentally observed below the knee region as pointed out by others [ 18 ] .",
    "the alteration of @xmath28 caused by the spectral indices does not spoil the existence of the ankle already present in @xmath28 versus energy as a low plateau ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "nor could the particular values of the spectral indices of all ions influence the existence the ankle since the sum of the individual ion spectra , on average , should compensate , in order to recover imperatively , the linearity shown in figure 5 .",
    "how the function @xmath28 is altered by the particular spectral indices is illustrated in figure 7 for helium with an index of 2.72 , and also for other ions .",
    "the indices and elemental abundances used in the present calculation are shown in table 1 , inspired from the results of some experiments ( kascade , jacee , atic , runjob , eas - top and others ) .",
    "figure 8 shows the proton energy spectrum with a spectral index of 2.6 , based on the atic experiment [ 17 ] , at very low energy .",
    "this spectrum is normalized to the flux of @xmath42 @xmath43/@xmath2 @xmath44@xmath45 @xmath46 , measured by kascade ( sibyll ) [ 19,20 ] at the energy of @xmath47 @xmath2 .",
    "the computed spectrum agrees fairly well with the measurements ; taking a softer index ( for example , 2.72 instead of 2.6 ) the agreement with the experimental data becomes excellent .",
    "the energy spectrum obtained by the qjsjet algorithms in kascade gives a similar accord , since the resulting spectrum rigidly shifts in intensity .",
    "note that this shift in intensity is absorbed in the normalization and the accord persists .",
    "the computed proton spectrum seems in disagreement with that measured by the tibetas@xmath48 collaboration [ 21 ] which has a lower energy bend and a softer descent compared to these calculations and to the kascade data .",
    "the computed helium and iron spectra also exhibit a good agreement with the kascade and eas - top data as discussed in detail in paper i and ii .",
    "let us remark here that by altering the values of the ion blends , within plausible empirical limits , the accord between computed and measured spectra persists .    .",
    "relative abundances of cosmic ions and spectral indices at the arbitrary energy of @xmath49 @xmath2 adopted in the calculation .",
    "the ion groupings cno , ne - s and fe(17 - 26 ) derive from the traditional data analysis in many experiments .",
    "the composition of the blend 3 , not given in the table , is 19.6 , 35.5 , 14.0 , 12.0 , 17.8 and 0.1 with the same spectral indices of the blend 2 except for the proton index which is 2.72 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the @xmath50 @xmath51 of the cosmic radiation is the sum of the @xmath52 @xmath53 of the individual ions .",
    "of course , it is assumed that electrons , positrons , antiprotons and other elementary particles have negligible fluxes compared to the global nuclide flux .    in figure 9 , the computed energy spectra for the ion blend 2 , in the interval @xmath29-@xmath32 @xmath2 ,",
    "are given .",
    "the tibet [ 22 ] and haverah park data [ 1 ] are reported in figure 9 while those of the akeno and agasa experiments [ 3 ] were shown previously ( figure 12 paper ii ) . the computed spectrum is required to agree with the experimental data only at arbitrary energy point of @xmath54 @xmath2 where the intensity ratio between tibet and kascade experiments is taken 1.4 . since no other constraint is imposed the overall accord is fairly good .",
    "the spectral index of 3.06 for this ion blend 2 in the energy interval @xmath55-@xmath56 @xmath2 is in excellent agreement with the data of the quoted experiments and others not shown , to avoid confusion in data superposition .",
    "the ion blends 1 and 3 give 3.05 and 3.0 , respectively , for the global spectral index @xmath48 .",
    "the extragalactic component of cosmic rays at the earth , if it exists , should cluster between @xmath57 ( proton ankle ) and @xmath58 @xmath2 ( iron ankle ) . this fundamental result ,",
    "derived elsewhere ( paper ii , section 7 ) , is almost independent of the method of calculation . taking advantage of this outcome",
    "two components of the cosmic ray flux at the earth may be disentangled : galactic and extragalactic .",
    "the distinction in two components rests on the initial sites ( milky way or outside ) of the acceleration regions once secondaries ( secondary protons , @xmath59he , be , b , etc . )",
    "generated in the wakes of the primaries may be neglected .",
    "the term @xmath60 would denote a number of possibilities : ( a ) debris of normal galaxies in the cosmic vicinity ; ( b ) reentrant particles overflowing from the milky way ; ( c ) debris of peculiar powerful galaxies ; ( d ) extragalactic particles of very high energy accelerated in space between galaxies .",
    "for the case ( b ) the more appropriate term @xmath61 cosmic rays is used .",
    "the ratio between the galactic and extragalactic intensities at earth , @xmath62/@xmath63 , in the band @xmath57 to @xmath58 @xmath2 depends on the ion blend adopted for the galactic component .",
    "detailed calculations with the blend 2 ( paper ii section 6 ) give the energy spectrum of the extradisc component , peaking around @xmath9 @xmath2 , as shown in figure 9 . at this particular energy ,",
    "the difference between the measured intensity and the computed galactic intensity is regarded , by definition , as an extradisc component . for the data shown in figure 9",
    "the ratio @xmath62/@xmath63 is @xmath64 while the agasa data with the same blend 2 give @xmath62/@xmath63=@xmath65 .",
    "the galactic magnetic field is the basic element ( though insufficient ) for the comprehension of the processes generating the ankle .",
    "the form and strength of the galactic magnetic field with its intrinsic turbulence are known with relatively high precision , adequate for this study .",
    "the adequacy is justified elsewhere ( paper ii appendix b ) .",
    "the average magnetic field strength fixes two milestones along the energy axis related to the alteration of the ion trajectories in the milky way : the ankles occur at the energies where the rectilinear propagation of cosmic ions commences , while the knees are placed at energies where the ion bending efficiency departs from an approximately uniform distribution , typical at lower energies . by a uniform bending",
    "is meant an approximately isotropic distribution in the ion directions in the vicinity of the source .",
    "the average distances travelled by cosmic ions in the milky way ( source vicinity ) have been previously calculated [ 10 ] .",
    "one should notice that the quantity @xmath28 versus energy changes by more than two orders of magnitude from the low to the high plateau ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "this computed gap is close to physical reality because of the accord with the data displayed in figures 8 and 9 .",
    "the upper limits of the measured anisotropies in the arrival direction of cosmic rays at the earth around the knee energy are about @xmath66 , and recent measurements [ 23,24 ] indicate the persistence of this figure even above @xmath12 @xmath2 [ 5 ] .",
    "consequently , the intrinsic mechanisms producing the knee dominate by several orders of magnitude those producing anisotropies .",
    "it follows that the accuracy required for knee and ankle calculations is , by far , less demanding that that required for anisotropy calculations .    for a given magnetic field configuration in the galaxy ,",
    "the rectilinear propagation of an ion occurs at a distinctive , particular energy .",
    "ion bending expressed by the curvature radius @xmath67 in a small volume permeated by a uniform constant field obeys the equation @xmath67=@xmath68/@xmath69@xmath70 , where @xmath68 is the ion momentum , @xmath69 the charge and the @xmath70 the average field strength in the region where the ion propagates .",
    "for instance , the effect of the ion bending for protons would cease at @xmath71 , while for iron this energy wlould be @xmath72 in an average magnetic field of 3 @xmath30 g if @xmath67 is 100 @xmath22 , the nominal thickness of the gaseous disc .",
    "these numerical games , though recurrent in the literature and textbooks , are both vague and thoroughly elusive to determine the exact positions of the @xmath31 along the energy axis . in figure 10 ,",
    "the onset of the rectilinear propagation for helium is shown as grammage versus energy .",
    "the rectilinear propagation takes place at @xmath6 @xmath2 .",
    "the lack of a unique @xmath67 for all ions impedes the exact determination of the knee energies with the above equation .",
    "to each ion corresponds a @xmath15 @xmath24 around the earth with an intrinsic dimension [ 10,11 ] dependent on the ion , and the correct estimate of the energy threshold of the rectilinear propagation requires the position of the solar cavity , the disc size and the nuclear cross sections .",
    "the mechanisms generating the ankles are the same as for the knees , but the physical conditions at the ankle energy region are less intricate .",
    "dissecting the phenomena which concur in the formation of the @xmath4 and individual @xmath31 we are finally left with the role of the nuclear cross sections .",
    "the results reported in figures 4,6 and 7 , along with those shown in the figure 11 , suffice to highlight this role .",
    "it is obvious from the spectra shown in figure 7 how the function @xmath28 , appearing in figure 4 , contributes to the formation of the ankle ( the spectral indices are incorporated in figure 7 ) .",
    "imagine an ideal , unreal situation where the gap between the low and high plateau is close to zero . neither a change of slope in the spectrum above @xmath73 @xmath2 nor the ankle would have been observed . in this circumstance ,",
    "the universal spectrum would have been entirely bound and regulated by the spectral indices , unaffected by this unreal compression of @xmath28 , with no @xmath31 at all . on the contrary , with a finite gap between the , low and high plateau ,",
    "the appearence of the ankle is a necessity .",
    "the position and magnitude of the ankle and its necessity may be further appreciated by taking into account : ( 1 ) the difference between the high and low plateau for the same ion ; ( 2 ) the difference between the low and high plateau in different ions ; ( 3 ) the difference between low and high plateau for extragalactic cosmic rays .",
    "the high plateau of any ion is fixed by the average matter thickness ( @xmath74 ) encountered by galactic cosmic rays and by @xmath19 . in the energy region of the low plateau",
    "the physical conditions present in the high plateau region are unchanged , except for lower grammages ( see figure 10 ) which ultimately imply low @xmath28 values . to elucidate the point ( 2 ) let us consider two different ions : he and fe , for example .",
    "since @xmath19(fe ) is higher than @xmath19(he ) , galactic iron suffers severe losses in the disc with respect to he losses .",
    "therefore @xmath28 for iron becomes smaller than that for helium , a result displayed in figure 6 ; similarly for other ion pairs with different @xmath19 .",
    "the low plateau of iron is similar to that of helium , and all low plateaux are almost equal for all ions ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "this is simply due to the exponential function governing nuclear collisions via the attenuation length @xmath75 = @xmath76/@xmath19@xmath20@xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath20 is extremely small , less than 0.008 @xmath78/@xmath79 , the difference in the product @xmath19@xmath20 for different ions is quite modest and the quantities @xmath28 for different ions cluster around a minimum value ( see figure 6 ) . by this argument",
    "it follows that the proton gap must be higher than that of helium and the helium gap higher than that of iron etc .",
    "a quite different result pertains to the extragalactic component for which the grammage is higher than that of the galactic component and the quantities @xmath28 in the energy band of the low plateau largely differ . above the energy of the rectilinear propagation the relative intensities of all extradisc ions have to be in the same ratios as do nuclear cross sections : @xmath19(p)/@xmath19(he ) , @xmath19(fe)/@xmath19(he ) etc .",
    "this aspect is beautifully displayed in figure 11 above @xmath12 @xmath2 for he , fe and protons using the number of nuclear collisions in the disc instead of the companion variable @xmath28 .",
    "the origin of the ankle described here may be further appreciated in comparison with other recent studies [ 26 ] where the ankle is a mere effect caused by the extragalactic component , introduced @xmath80 @xmath81 .",
