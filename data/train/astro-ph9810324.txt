    "the process of dynamical friction , defined as momentum loss by a massive moving object due to its gravitational interaction with its own gravitationally - induced wake , arises in many astronomical systems .",
    "examples of systems in which such effects are well known to be important include stars in clusters or galaxies , galaxies in galaxy clusters , and binary star cores in the common envelope phase of evolution . in the first two examples , the surrounding background medium in general consists of a combination of collisionless matter ( stars , galaxies , dark matter ) and gas ,",
    "while in the third example the surrounding medium is entirely gaseous . as a corollary to the dynamical friction process , in all these cases the background medium is heated at an equal and opposite rate to the energy lost by the perturber .",
    "the analytic theory for the gravitational drag in collisionless systems was developed by @xcite , and over the decades since has enjoyed widespread theoretical application , extensive verification by numerical experiments , and well - documented embodiment in observed astronomical systems .",
    "the variety of important consequences of gravitational drag in collisionless astronomical systems includes mass segregation in star clusters , sinking satellites in dark matter galaxy halos , orbital decay of binary supermassive black holes after galaxy mergers , etc . ;",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "less well - developed is the corresponding theory of dynamical friction in a gaseous ( i.e. , collisional ) medium . for supersonic motion , analytic linear - theory estimates of the gravitational drag under assumption of a steady state",
    "were obtained by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the resulting estimates for the drag force in the steady supersonic case take the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond respectively to the effective linear sizes of the surrounding medium and the perturbing object , similar to the drag formula obtained for a collisionless medium .",
    "although there is some ambiguity in the definition of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the estimate ( [ ssdrag ] ) appears consistent with calculations of the gravitational drag that are obtained as a by - product of numerical hydrodynamic investigations focused on the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion problem  see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and ruffert and collaborators ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    for steady - state , subsonic motion of the perturber , the front - back symmetry of the perturbed density distribution about the perturber led @xcite to argue that gravitational drag is absent in the subsonic , inviscid case . considering that the drag force for the supersonic case increases proportional to @xmath20 with decreasing perturber speed , @xmath21",

    ", we note that equation ( [ alpha ] ) is properly valid only for @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81 .",
    "to compute the gravitational drag on the perturber , we need to evaluate the gravitational force between the perturber and its wake , @xmath82 to perform the volume integral , it is convenient to transform to a spherical polar coordinate system ( @xmath83 ) centered on the massive perturber , with @xmath84 and @xmath85 . defining @xmath86 , @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 where @xmath89 here @xmath90 represents the sum in equation ( [ alphasum ] ) .",

    "the perturber is surrounded by a concentric distribution of similar ellipsoids , and is displaced by @xmath98 forward from the center of the sonic sphere ( radius @xmath99 ) surrounding its initial position .",
    "the nearby , complete ellipsoids exert no net force on the perturber , but the larger , cut - off ones with semiminor axes between @xmath100 and @xmath101 lag behind the perturber ( see figure 1 ) and exert a gravitational drag .",
    "thus , the radial integral in equation ( [ dfint ] ) has upper / lower limits @xmath102 , and the angular integral has limits @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "the integrals are straightforward ; the result is @xmath105 the implicit assumptions in deriving this equation are that @xmath100 exceeds the effective size of the perturber ( @xmath19 ) , and that @xmath101 is smaller than the effective size of the surrounding gaseous medium ( @xmath18 ) . under these conditions , the dynamical drag is time - independent , and non - zero .",
    "the steady - state result that zero net force results from the front - back symmetry of the density distribution is misleading ; because of the long - range nature of the coulomb potential , the total drag force at any time depends on the unchanging ratio @xmath106 between the semiminor axes of the furthest and closest perturbing _ partial _ spheroids .",
    "the gravitational drag is always dominated by the far - field , and at any time the perturber is located ahead of center of the sonic sphere .",
    "physically , we can associate the energy loss arising from the drag force with the rate at which the expanding sound wave does work on the background medium . in the limit of a very slow perturber @xmath107 , @xmath108 , so that the drag force is proportional to the perturber s speed @xmath21 .    for the supersonic case",

    "was earlier introduced by @xcite in a time - dependent analysis of stellar relaxation . ]    in figure 3 , we plot the dynamical friction force as a function of the mach number for several values of @xmath119 .",
    "the main formal result of this paper is the evaluation , in linear perturbation theory , of the gravitational drag force @xmath120 on a massive perturber @xmath0 moving on a straight - line trajectory through an infinite , homogeneous , gaseous medium of density @xmath2 and sound speed @xmath3 .",
    "together with the definition in equation ( [ dragdef ] ) , the expressions ( [ isub ] ) and ( [ isuper ] ) give the dynamical friction ( df ) drag forces on subsonic and supersonic perturbers , respectively .",
    "figure 3 presents the same results graphically , showing how the drag force varies with the mach number @xmath79 of the perturber , and the time over which the perturber has been moving with fixed speed @xmath121 .",
    "for comparison , we have also included in figure 3 the result for the gravitational drag on a particle of mass @xmath0 moving through a collisionless medium with the same density @xmath2 as the gaseous medium we have considered , and with a maxwellian distribution of particle velocities with @xmath122 . from equation ( 7 - 18 ) of @xcite , the collisionless df drag force is given by expression ( [ dragdef ] ) with @xmath123,\\ ] ] where @xmath124 . from figure 3",
    ", it is clear that ( a ) for @xmath14 , the collisionless and gaseous df forces are identical ( as has been previously noted ) ; ( b ) for @xmath6 , the drag force is generally larger in a collisionless medium than in a gaseous medium , because in the latter case pressure forces create a symmetric distribution in the background medium in the vicinity of the perturber ; ( c ) the functional form of the gaseous df drag is much more sharply peaked near @xmath125 than it is for the collisionless df drag ; perturbers moving at speeds near mach 1 resonantly interact with the pressure waves that they launch in the background medium ; ( d ) for a given value of @xmath126 , the peak value of the gaseous df force is much larger than the corresponding peak value of the collisionless df force ; at @xmath127 , there is a factor of four difference in the force between the two cases .",
    "below , we explore some potential consequences of these results in a variety of astronomical systems .    as a consequence of the stronger gaseous df force than collisionless df drag force for supersonic motion , massive objects",
    "may make their way more rapidly to the center of a star cluster or galaxy if they arrive at the outer edge before , rather than after , the gas is turned into stars . for a particular example , we consider the decay of a massive perturber s near - circular orbit in a spherical density distribution with a singular isothermal sphere profile , @xmath128 so @xmath129 ( here @xmath3 respectively denotes the sound speed or velocity dispersion for a gaseous or stellar distribution ) .",
    "for this density profile , the circular speed is constant , @xmath130 . by equating the rate of decrease of angular momentum @xmath131 to the torque @xmath132 , one finds that the time for the perturber s orbit to decay from @xmath133 to @xmath134 is given approximately by @xmath135 for gaseous df .",
    "this time is a factor of @xmath136 shorter than the corresponding decay time under stellar df ( cf .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "7 - 25 ) . for galactic applications ,",
    "the implication is that condensed objects that form early ( e.g. globular clusters ) could spiral into the galactic center from a factor 1.5 further in a galaxy than would be predicted by stellar df theory ( @xcite ) , within the epoch over which the baryonic distribution remains gaseous . for",
    "star cluster applications , the shorter df time for gaseous distributions may help explain why young , embedded stellar clusters like the orion nebular cluster ( @xcite , @xcite ) appear significantly more relaxed than expected from stellar df alone ; e.g. , for the onc , n - body simulations show that stellar df would require a time a factor 3 - 4 longer than the best estimate of the cluster age to establish the observed mass segregation ( @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned above ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , the gaseous df force is strongly depressed for subsonic perturbers . for modeling the _ global _ evolution of combined star - gas systems in which the particle velocity dispersion and gas sound speed are comparable",
    ", the strong cutoff of @xmath120 for subsonic perturbers implies that setting @xmath137 for @xmath138 ( e.g. @xcite ) should yield realistic results .",
    "however , in other circumstances it is interesting to enquire how the small , but nonzero , df drag on subsonic perturbers ( computed in this paper ) can affect their orbit evolution .    as a model problem",
    ", we consider the decay of a subsonically - moving mass @xmath0 on a near - circular orbit embedded within a constant - density gaseous sphere of radius @xmath139 . for constant background density , the angular orbit frequency @xmath140 and orbital period @xmath141 are independent of the distance @xmath142 from the center . if this constant - density region represents the core of a nonsingular isothermal sphere with core radius @xmath139 and sound speed @xmath3 , then @xmath143 ;",
    "thus , the mach number for a circular orbit at @xmath142 is @xmath144 .",
    "just as above for decay in a power - law density profile , we can compute the time for the perturber s orbit to decay from @xmath145 to @xmath146 as @xmath147 the numerical coefficient equals @xmath148 .",
    "figure 4a shows how the decay of the orbital radius depends on time and on the mass of the perturber relative to the whole core . in figure 4b",
    ", we verify that the assumption of a near - circular orbit is valid provided @xmath149 , since @xmath150 which has the limit @xmath151 for @xmath107 . in arriving at the results shown in fig .",
    "4 , we have used equation ( [ isub ] ) .",
    "its validity depends , however , on the size of the uniform - density core exceeding that of the perturbed - density region .",
    "this assumption must fail , and the df drag force consequently decrease , when the forward wave defining the disturbed - density region ( cf .",
    "1 ) reaches a distance @xmath152 ahead of the perturber .",
    "changes by @xmath153 four times per orbit , the forward - wave propagation effectively `` restarts '' as well .",
    "when @xmath154 , over each quarter orbit , each new expansion wave propagates to just @xmath152 ; over much of the quarter - orbit , an unbalanced trailing density enhancement will remain within the core .",
    "thus , we expect that the df drag will still be some fraction of the value found using eq .",
    "( [ isub ] ) , although a more refined calculation is needed to predict the fraction quantitatively .",
    "] the position @xmath155 of the perturber at this time is plotted as a function of @xmath156 in figure 5 .",
    "based on this figure , only perturbers of mass @xmath157 are predicted to reach within one - tenth of a core radius before the df drag decreases . for lower - mass perturbers , this implies that the decay of orbits to very small radii may stall , if the df drag is sharply reduced after the time @xmath158 .",
    "this result may have relevance for models of qso evolution ( @xcite ) in which primordial black holes are formed away from the centers of galaxies , later to be driven there by df during mergers . if , as assumed in this scenario , these events occur before the advent of star formation , than the relevant df drag is the gaseous df examined in this paper .",
    "if the df drag becomes inefficient when the orbit reaches the protogalaxy core and becomes subsonic , then these massive black holes may have more time to grow by accretion before they finally sink to the centers of their host galaxies .    finally , we comment on the applicability of our results to the interaction of protoplanets with a gaseous circumstellar nebula in which they may grow .",
    "protoplanets orbit faster than the surrounding gaseous nebula , with the mach number of the drift speed @xmath159 ( where @xmath160 is the local kepler angular rotation frequency and @xmath142 is the protoplanet s semimajor axis ) .",
    "drag forces occur as a result of this relative motion , leading to inward radial migration of protoplanets as they lose angular momentum to the surrounding nebula ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . using parameters based on solid bodies in the protosolar nebula",
    ", it can be shown that the nominal df drag from equations ( [ dragdef ] ) and ( [ isub ] ) , @xmath161 , exceeds the large - reynolds number aerodynamic drag @xmath162 ( @xcite ,  45 ) for protoplanets of radius @xmath163 greater than a few @xmath164 .",
    "it is sometime argued that gravitationally - enhanced drag on protoplanets ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , but note the different scaling from our results ) may enhance migration rates over those predicted to arise from differential resonant torques ( @xcite ) between the protoplanet and the surrounding nebula .",
    "in fact , provided that the difference of gas orbits from kepler orbits is included so that the perturber does not corotate with the nebular gas at the same radial distance , then the df drag is automatically incorporated in the net resonant torque . indeed , calculations show that the net resonant torque from a thin disk ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , taking this velocity difference into account , is of the same magnitude ( and scaling ) as the df drag estimated above .",
    "thus , while the gaseous df drag may have implications for the late stages of planet formation , its effects are naturally incorporated within a full resonant formalism .",
    "although such a calculation has not yet been performed in three dimensions , it is reassuring that our simple estimate of the drag  which neglects gradients of velocity , density , and temperature in the disk  and the estimates from 2d resonant torque differences  which neglect the disk thickness  nevertheless yield comparable answers ."
