    "in the fundamental hadronic theory , the gauge theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , isospin symmetry is not manifested in an obvious way . as part of an ongoing work on the light - cone approach",
    ", the present note contributes another facet to this problem @xcite .",
    "as reviewed in @xcite , the light - cone approach is to diagonalize the light - cone hamiltonian , @xmath9 , and to calculate the spectra and invariant mass - squared of physical particles .",
    "in particular the method addresses calculation of the associated wave functions @xmath10 , which are the fock - space projections of the hadrons eigenstate .",
    "the total wave function for a meson is then @xmath11 . the problem has been solved thus far only for 1-space dimension by the method of discretized light - cone quantization , see @xcite , a method which in principle can be applied also to the physical 3-space and 1-time dimensions .",
    "[ t ]    for 3-space dimensions , however , it is technically easier to resort to an effective interaction .",
    "one can reduce the full light - cone hamiltonian with its complicated many - body aspects by the method of iterated resolvents @xcite to an effective light - cone hamiltonian @xmath12 , which yields the same eigenvalues and which by definition acts only in the fock space of a quark and an anti - quark @xmath13 with the effective hamiltonian @xmath14 the kinetic energy @xmath15 is as usual a diagonal operator in momentum space while the effective interaction kernel @xmath16 is off - diagonal .",
    "it has two contributions , an effective one - gluon - exchange interaction @xmath17 and an effective two - gluon - annihilation interaction @xmath18 .",
    "the action of these two interactions is conceptually different , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . in the upper left diagram",
    ", the vertex interaction @xmath19 creates a virtual gluon which propagates with the two quarks in the @xmath20-space by means of the propagator @xmath21 , before it is annihilated by another action of @xmath19 .",
    "the momentum transfer causes a genuine @xmath22-interaction .",
    "if it is absorbed however on the same line by the quark , as illustrated by the diagram in the upper right of the figure , the momentum is unchanged , hence there is no interaction but a contribution to the effective quark mass .",
    "the vertex interaction @xmath19 is known and tabulated in @xcite , as part of the total light - cone hamiltonian @xmath23 .",
    "a priori unknown is the propagator @xmath24 , and much of the compact , and perhaps confusing , discussion in @xcite deals with this question .",
    "a broader presentation is now available in @xcite .",
    "there , it is also shown that the higher fock - space wave functions like @xmath25 , can be found by quadratures like @xmath26 , _",
    "i.e. _ as functionals of @xmath27 without that an other eigenvalue problem has to be solved .",
    "the second part of the interaction is even more complicated , as illustrated in the lower diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . there",
    ", the second hit of @xmath19 does not absorb the gluon but creates a second one .",
    "together they propagate in the @xmath28-space by means of the propagator @xmath29 .",
    "finally , a third and fourth action of @xmath19 brings the system back to the @xmath22-space. the graphs in the figure illustrate the difference of the two interactions : @xmath30 conserves the flavor of each quark individually , as opposed to @xmath31 which can act only if the quark and anti - quark have the same flavor and which scatters a pair @xmath32 into the same or another pair @xmath33 .",
    "the question i ask in this short note is : does the excellent agreement between theory and experiment to be reported in section  [ sec:2 ] gets spoiled when i include the flavor - changing interaction @xmath31 ?    for this purpose",
    "i summarize the main results for the flavor - conserving interaction @xmath30 in section  [ sec:2 ] and formulate a very simple model for including the flavor - changing interaction @xmath31 in section  [ sec:3 ] .",
    "this will allow me to present numerical results in section  [ sec:4 ] , which are based on the numerical diagonalization of a @xmath5-matrix .",
    "to understand these results analytically , i formulate a schematic model in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "i draw the conclusions in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "if one restricts to mesons whose valence quarks and anti - quarks have different flavor , one can solve the simpler equation @xmath34 to obtain physical masses @xmath35 and the associated wave functions @xmath36 .",
    "i refer to these mesons as flavor - off - diagonal .",
    "the solution of this equation is far from trivial .",
    "one faces all the difficult questions of gauge field theory , among them introducing cut - offs and their removal by renormalization . by reducing the difficulties with the simple @xmath0-model @xcite , it was possible to generate solutions with a rather modest effort .",
    "i see no point in quoting many details since they will not be needed here , except the fact that the model has the 7 + 1 canonical parameters of a gauge field theory : the strong coupling constant @xmath37 , the six flavor quark masses @xmath38 , plus the one scale parameter @xmath39 , which arises due to renormalization . by adjusting them ,",
    "all flavor - off - diagonal meson - masses are reproduced , see tables  [ tab:2.2 ] and [ tab:1.2 ] , with the experimental data taken from @xcite .",
    "[ t ]    .the empirical masses of the flavor - off - diagonal physical mesons in mev . the vector mesons are given in the upper , the scalar mesons in the lower triangle .",
    "[ tab:1.2 ] [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     upon second thought one realizes that the flavor - changing interaction causes a flavor - mixing as illustrated in table  [ fig : focksp ] .",
    "the matrix shown in this table displays the kernel of the effective hamiltonian as a matrix of block matrices @xcite .",
    "say , the effective hamiltonian @xmath40 contributes @xmath41 to the diagonal blocks .",
    "the flavor - changing interaction @xmath31 contributes @xmath42 , thus every diagonal block is @xmath43 . but @xmath31 contributes also to the sector - dependend off - diagonal blocks which depend on the flavor masses .    the diagonalization of @xmath40 and the generation of @xmath44 can be understood as a unitary transformation to pre - diagonalize the flavor - mixing matrix . although @xmath45 is not true in general , one can expect that the off - diagonal matrix elements ( @xmath46 ) are ( much ) smaller than the diagonal ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "requiring eq.([eq : modi ] ) to be true , however , makes things very simple .",
    "eq.([eq : modi ] ) will be referred to as model assumption i. as model assumption ii , i introduce @xmath48 just to reduce their number . in principle , these correlations could be calculated from the wave functions , but here i adjust @xmath49 as a free parameter to experiment . note that @xmath49 is different for pseudo - scalar and vector mesons , since their wave functions are different .    for @xmath50 flavors , the model assumptions ( [ eq : modi ] ) and ( [ eq : modii ] ) reduce the problem to diagonalize a @xmath5-matrix :",
    "@xmath51 the flavor - diagonal mass eigenvalues @xmath52 are fixed by the @xmath0-model and are tabulated below , in tables  [ tab:4 ] and [ tab:5 ] .",
    "adjusting the only free parameter @xmath49 to the mass of the @xmath53 yields the eigenfunctions @xmath54 as displayed in table  [ tab : wav ] .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues , the physical masses @xmath55 , are given in table  [ tab:4 ] .",
    "the wave functions in table  [ tab : wav ] have a characteristic pattern which should be discussed to some further detail . only the light flavors @xmath56 are mixed significantly , while the heavy flavors @xmath57 are essentially pure .",
    "the physical @xmath3 is a superposition of the @xmath58 and the @xmath59-state with no admixture of the @xmath60 .",
    "the pattern @xmath61 is independent of @xmath49 and a consequence of the equal up and down quark mass , as to be understood by the considerations in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "the wave functions of the @xmath7 and the @xmath53 have the pattern @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , in rough agreement with the su(3)-pattern to be explained .    by adjusting one single parameter ,",
    "one reproduces three empirical facts : ( 1 ) the mass of the @xmath3 is ( roughly ) degenerate with @xmath1 ( isospin ) ; ( 2 ) the unperturbed mass of the @xmath7 is lifted from the comparably small value of @xmath64  mev to the comparatively large value of @xmath65  mev ; ( 3 ) the unperturbed mass of the @xmath53 is lifted by roughly 50% the meet the experimental value due to the fit .",
    "to understand better the pattern of the wave functions in table  [ tab : wav ] , i select first to 2 flavors with equal masses @xmath66 .",
    "the flavor - mixing matrix reduces to a 2 by 2 matrix , with @xmath67 the diagonalization of @xmath68 is easy .",
    "the two eigenstates , @xmath69 are associated with the eigenvalues @xmath70 the assumption of equal quark masses leads thus to @xmath71 .",
    "they can be arranged into a mass degenerate triplet of isospin 1 , independent of the numerical value of @xmath49 .",
    "next , consider 3 flavors .",
    "the flavor mixing matrix for the ground state becomes @xmath72 if one assumes @xmath73 , thus @xmath74 , as above , @xmath75 can be diagonalized again in closed form .",
    "the three eigenstates @xmath76 are associated with the eigenvalues @xmath77 the coherent state picks up all the strength , again .",
    "the eigenvalues of the remaining two states coincide with the unperturbed ones .",
    "state @xmath78 can again be interpreted as the eigenstate for the charge neutral @xmath3 and the mass of the coherent state @xmath79 could be fitted with the @xmath53 .",
    "but then state @xmath80 is degenerate with the @xmath3 : instead of a mass triplet , one has a mass quadruplet . in the calculation of section  [ sec:3 ] , this degeneracy is broken by the quark mass differences .",

    "in the present light - cone approach to gauge theory with an effective interaction isospin is not a dynamic symmetry , but a consequence of equal up and down mass .",
    "flavor - su(3 ) is an approximate symmetry .",
    "the approach explains the phenomenological observation that flavor - su(3 ) symmetry works better than su(4 ) or su(5 ) : the large mass of the heavy quarks dominates the flavor - mixing matrix so strongly that the symmetry induced by the annihilation interaction is destroyed . despite the simple model",
    ", the present work contributes to the @xmath7-@xmath53 puzzle @xcite and has an accuracy comparable to state - of - art lattice - gauge calculations @xcite . to the best of my knowledge no other model including the phenomenological ones @xcite covers the whole range of flavored hadrons with the same set of parameters .",
    "the present approach is in conflict , however , with other theoretical constructs .",
    "zero modes are absent since one works with the light - cone gauge @xmath90 @xcite . in consequence",
    "there are no chiral condensates which seem to be so important otherwise .",
    "they are not needed here since the parameter @xmath49 provides the additional mass scale .",
    "this fit - parameter is not on the same level as the physical parameters of the theory like the strong coupling constant @xmath37 or the quark - flavor masses @xmath38 .",
    "the present but still on - going work gives evidence why its calculation from theory might be worth the effort .",
