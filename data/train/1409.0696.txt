    "the nasa _ kepler _ mission has provided photometric observations of exquisite quality for asteroseismic studies of a diverse range of pulsating stars ( gilliland et al .",
    "particularly noteworthy has been the large volume of data collected on cool main - sequence , subgiant and red - giant stars showing solar - like oscillations , pulsations that are excited and intrinsically damped by near - surface convection ( chaplin & miglio 2013 ) .",
    "the successful asteroseismology programme looks set to continue in the re - purposed _ kepler _ mission , k2 ( howell et al .",
    "the quality of the k2 photometry for asteroseismic studies of coherent pulsators has already been demonstrated by results from engineering test data ( jeffery & ramsay 2014 ; hermes et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the photometric performance has also confirmed the predicted potential for studies of solar - like oscillators ( chaplin et al .",
    "2013 ) , studies that will be made possible by the longer , full - campaign science data .",
    "_ kepler _ data were collected in two cadences ( koch et al .",
    "2010 ) during the 4-yr - long nominal mission .",
    "data on up to 170,000 targets were available in the 29.4-minute long cadence ( lc ) , whilst a much smaller total of up to 512 targets could be observed simultaneously in the 58.85-second short cadence ( sc ) .",
    "these cadences establish nyquist frequencies for the two modes of operation of @xmath0 ( in lc ) and @xmath4 ( in sc ) .",
    "the lc nyquist frequency coincides with the dominant periods of oscillation shown by cool stars that lie just above the base of the red - giant branch .",
    "both cadences have been maintained for the k2 mission , but the total number of targets for each observing campaign has been reduced  to approximately 10,000 and 50 targets , respectively  because of the need for larger pixel target masks .    the detection of solar - like oscillations in cool main - sequence and subgiant stars , and stars at the very bottom of the red - giant branch , demands that the target - limited sc data be utilized since the dominant periods of oscillation are shorter than one hour .",
    "observations made in the numerous long - cadence slots are sufficient to detect oscillations in more evolved red giants , because the relevant pulsation periods are longer .",
    "oscillations have already been detected in around 16,000 red giants in the nominal mission lc data ( hekker et al . 2011 ; stello et al . 2013 ; huber et al . 2014 ) .",
    "kepler _ increased the number of cool main - sequence and subgiant stars with asteroseismic data by over an order of magnitude , to around 700 targets ( chaplin et al .",
    ", 2011a , 2014 ; huber et al .",
    "2013 ) , totals were nevertheless limited by the available number of sc target slots .",
    "the possibility of detecting solar - like oscillations in lc data _ above _ the lc nyquist frequency ",
    "i.e. , in the `` super - nyquist '' regime  offers the potential to increase significantly the number of evolved subgiant and low - luminosity red - giant targets amenable to asteroseismic study .",
    "the use of lc data for super - nyquist studies of coherent pulsators has been considered in some detail by murphy et al .",
    "baran et al . ( 2012 ) also employed a super - nyquist analysis of a compact pulsator observed in sc . while gaulme et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and beck et al .",
    "( 2014 ) identified a few red giants with oscillation frequencies above the lc nyquist frequency , the prospects for studying solar - like oscillators in the lc super - nyquist regime have not yet been explored in any detail .",
    "our aim in this paper is to consider the utility of the archival _ kepler _ and future k2 data for such studies .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : recap ] with a summary of some of the basic principles from fourier analysis that are relevant to our study .",
    "we then consider in section  [ sec : kepler ] the specific case of _ kepler _ long - cadence observations ; and in section  [ sec : solar ] we go on to consider the characteristics of the super - nyquist spectrum shown by solar - like oscillators , considering the impact of the finite mode lifetimes ( section  [ sec : life ] ) , the use of a priori information to discriminate true from aliased peaks in the frequency spectrum ( section  [ sec : prior ] ) , and the reduced s / n above the nyquist frequency ( section  [ sec : sinc ] ) .",
    "we include model predictions for subgiant and low - luminosity red giant stars , and real super - nyquist examples from the _ kepler _ archive ( section  [ sec : real ] ) .",
    "we finish the paper in section  [ sec : conc ] with concluding remarks .",
    "let us begin by considering the simple case of a sinusoidal signal of frequency @xmath5 , sampled at regular intervals @xmath6 in time .",
    "this establishes a sampling frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the well - known sampling theorem ( nyquist 1928 ; shannon 1949 ) tells us that when @xmath8 , the sampling is sufficient to completely determine the signal  we say the signal is oversampled  and there is no ambiguity in the measured frequency .",
    "we may also write the sampling requirement as @xmath9 , where the nyquist frequency , @xmath10 , is defined as @xmath11 what happens if instead the signal is undersampled , so that @xmath12 ?",
    "power will be present in the `` super - nyquist '' regime of the frequency spectrum at the true frequency , @xmath5 ; and it will also now be reflected , or aliased , back into the frequency region below @xmath10 . if we write the true frequency as @xmath13 , there will be peaks at @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "there is now an ambiguity in the estimated frequency , and we are completely reliant on using other knowledge to pick the true frequency .",
    "we shall see that irregular time sampling offers the potential to lift this degeneracy provided the signal is coherent , or nearly coherent , over the duration of the observations ( of which more in section  [ sec : kepler ] below ) .",
    "the appearence of the frequency spectrum is also affected by the amount of time during each cadence @xmath6 that is used to collect data , i.e. , in our case , to integrate photons from the target star .",
    "if a high fraction of each cadence is used to collect data , we may significantly underestimate the true amplitude because each datum may average the time - varying signal .",
    "if the integration time per cadence is @xmath16 , then a signal of frequency @xmath5 will have its amplitude attenuated by the factor ( e.g. , campante 2012 ) : @xmath17 .",
    "\\label{eq : sincgeneral}\\ ] ] when the fraction of each cadence given over to integration is unity , so that @xmath18 , the attenuation may then be written as ( e.g. , chaplin et al .",
    "2011b ; huber et al .",
    "2011 ; murphy 2012 ) : @xmath19 =        { \\rm sinc } \\left [ \\pi \\left ( \\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_{\\rm s } } \\right )          \\right]\\ ] ] @xmath20 .",
    "\\label{eq : sinc}\\ ] ] the attenuation in power is given by the square of the sinc function , @xmath21 .",
    "even when the integration duty cycle is close to 100per cent and the attenuation is at its strongest  which is the case for _ kepler _ ; see section  [ sec : kepler ] below ",
    "equation  [ eq : sinc ] indicates that one still has sensitivity to signals in the super - nyquist regime ( @xmath22 ) since the first zero of the sinc function does not occur until @xmath23 .",
    "it is also worth remarking that even when signals are oversampled , so that @xmath9 , there is still significant attenuation close to the nyquist frequency .",
    "= 9.0 cm = 9.0 cm    the _ kepler _ lc data are comprised of @xmath24-min cadences ( jenkins et al .",
    "2010 ) that are exactly regular in the spacecraft frame of reference .",
    "this establishes a notional lc nyquist frequency of @xmath25 .",
    "each 29.4-min cadence is in turn a summation of 270 individual @xmath26-sec readouts ( e.g. , gilliland et al .",
    "most of each cadence is therefore given over to the collection of photons .",
    "the very high fractional duty cycle for the _ kepler _ integrations means the signal attenuation follows closely that described by equation  [ eq : sinc ] .",
    "the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows the frequency - power spectrum of idealized observations , made on a regular _ kepler_-like cadence , of several undersampled sinusoids .",
    "the sinudoids are all of unit amplitude and have frequencies lying in the super - nyquist regime between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "peaks due to the true frequencies are rendered as black lines .",
    "the vertical dashed lines mark multiples of @xmath10 .",
    "peaks in grey are therefore aliases of the true frequencies . the spectrum is repeated every @xmath29 because of the discrete nature of the calculation .    this power spectrum has been calibrated below ) . ] so that a sinusoid of unit amplitude with an infinite sample rate would show a maximum power per bin of unity .",
    "the observed powers at the true frequencies are much lower than unity , the true power .",
    "this is due to the sinc - function attenuation described by equation  [ eq : sinc ] .",
    "the dotted line marks the sinc - squared suppression envelope in power , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "the above is not quite the whole story as far as timing issues for the _ kepler _ observations are concerned .",
    "_ kepler _ lies in a 372.5-day heliocentric , earth - trailing orbit .",
    "observations of the pulsations of a _ kepler _ target  be it one in the original field , or in the k2 fields in the ecliptic plane  will be phase modulated in the spacecraft frame of reference .",
    "this is because there is a component of the orbital motion of _ kepler _ along the line - of - sight ( target ) direction , which delays or advances the arrival time of light from the star .",
    "the annual size of the effect is approximately @xmath30sec for targets in the original field , and approximately @xmath31sec for targets in the ecliptic ( where the k2 fields lie ) .    to compensate for this effect the _ kepler _",
    "time stamps are corrected to barycentric arrival times ( actually barycentric dynamical time ; see , e.g. , garca et al .",
    "an important consequence is that the intervals between time stamps are no longer regular , but are modulated periodically on a @xmath32-yr timescale .",
    "this periodic modulation splits the aliased peaks in the frequency spectrum into many components , as discussed in detail by murphy et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows the result of simulating lc observations of an idealized star in the original _ kepler _ field undergoing coherent pulsations .",
    "the artificial data span four simulated years and include the aforementioned timing effects .",
    "the simulated pulsations are the same , undersampled sinusoids from the left - hand panel .",
    "notice how the aliases are no longer exact , reflected copies about multiples of @xmath33 .",
    "some copies have different maximum power spectral densities ( i.e. , peak heights in the spectrum ) than others .",
    "the reason for this is that the splitting of the power into several components reduces the maximum heights in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , relative to those expected for simple reflected aliases ( the total integrated power in the aliases is conserved ) .",
    "the top left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows a zoom of the peak due to the true frequency marked ` a ' in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , whilst the other panels show zooms its aliases marked ` b ' , ` c ' and ` d ' on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . as explained by murphy et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the exact manner in which the alias peaks are affected by the timing modulation depends on the relation of their frequencies to the sampling frequency .",
    "if the true frequency is @xmath5 , then aliases at @xmath34 , or equivalently @xmath35 , will share the same structure , e.g. , what is predominantly a triplet structure when @xmath36 , or a quintuplet structure when @xmath37 , with the frequency splitting between adjacent components being @xmath38 .",
    "murphy et al . ( 2013 ) pointed out that for high - amplitude , coherent pulsations the introduction of sideband structure , which is well resolved in the nominal mission _ kepler _ data , allows one to discriminate the real and aliased peaks .",
    "what about solar - like oscillations , which are not coherent and typically have much lower amplitudes ( and hence lower s / n levels in the frequency spectrum ) than coherent pulsations ?    = 9.0 cm = 9.0 cm    = 9.0 cm = 9.0 cm",
    "the first issue we confront is that solar - like oscillations have finite lifetimes . in most cases the lifetimes @xmath39 of detectable oscillations are significantly shorter than the duration @xmath40 of the observations ( e.g. , dupret et al .",
    "2009 ) . only for some gravity - dominated mixed modes of red giants",
    "do the lifetimes of detected oscillations approach or exceed lengths commensurate with multi - month - long observations .",
    "one might therefore not usually expect to be able to resolve the aforementioned sideband structure in the frequency domain .",
    "the underlying noise - free or `` limit - spectrum '' profiles due to solar - like oscillations are to good approximation lorentzian in shape , with the fwhm of the peaks given by @xmath41 ( e.g. , see chaplin et al .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows how a finite mode lifetime would affect the appearence of the aliased quintuplet from the bottom left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the different linestyles show the composite , aliased limit - spectrum profiles expected when the real mode has a lifetime ( linewidth ) of 73days ( @xmath42 ; dashed line ) , 123days ( @xmath43 ; dotted line ) , 184days ( @xmath44 ; dark solid line ) and 1yr ( @xmath45 ; grey solid line ) .",
    "lifetimes of solar - like oscillations in main - sequence and subgiant stars are typically of the order of several days in length",
    ". the lifetimes of detected radial mode oscillations in red giants can be as long as the 73-day lifetime considered above ( e.g. , corsaro et al .",
    "the corresponding dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] would be barely indistinguishable from a lorentzian profile in the presence of real noise",
    ". the same would of course be true for shorter mode lifetimes .",
    "the longer lifetimes modelled in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] show much more significant departures from a lorentzian appearence .",
    "/ n levels in the observed modes are sufficiently high , it might therefore be possible to discriminate visually the sidebands of some long - lived modes .",
    "it is worth noting once more that amplitudes of solar - like oscillations are usually much lower than for coherent pulsators , making it harder to distinguish the sideband structure .",
    "we conclude that an important consequence of the finite mode lifetimes is that in most cases one would no longer be able to distinguish aliased from true oscillation peaks on account of the sideband structure .",
    "however , for solar - like oscillators we are fortunate in that we do not need to rely on such discrimination alone .",
    "= 9.0 cm      the rich spectra of overtones shown by solar - like oscillators provides the necessary , a priori information to allow us to select the true spectrum from the aliased spectra .",
    "we illustrate how with a real example , the low - luminosity red giant kic4351319 .",
    "this target was observed in both long and short cadence during the nominal _ kepler _ mission .",
    "here , we have used data prepared using the pdc - map pipeline ( stumpe et al . 2012 ; smith et al .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] shows the frequency power spectra of simultaneous lc ( upper plot ) and sc ( lower plot ) pdc - map data from _ kepler _ quarters q8 through q17 .",
    "the nominal lc nyquist frequency , @xmath10 , is marked by the vertical dashed line .",
    "the luxury afforded by having contemporaneous data available also in sc  where the oscillations are oversampled  of course allows us to tag the peaks in the lc spectrum above @xmath10 as the true oscillation frequencies ( see the figure ) .",
    "however , two checks based on use of the lc spectrum alone allow us to make the same call .",
    "= 11.0 cm    = 11.0 cm    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] shows a zoom of the lc spectrum above and below @xmath10 .",
    "our first check relates to the large frequency separation , @xmath46 , the spacing shown by consecutive overtones of the same angular ( spherical ) degree , @xmath47 .",
    "an extensive body of literature has now established a fairly tight correlation between the average large separation and the observed frequency of maximum oscillation power , @xmath48 ( e.g. , see hekker et al .",
    "2009 ; stello et al . 2009 ; huber et al . 2011 ; mosser et al .",
    "this relation may be expressed in the form @xmath49 , with @xmath50 for the cool subgiants and low - luminosity red giants of interest here . while there is evidently spread in the relation due to , for example , dependences on mass and metallicity ,",
    "the strong correlation nevertheless allows us to discriminate the true from the aliased spectrum .",
    "the lengths of the horizontal arrows in the bottom panel correspond to expected average separations , assuming a @xmath48 of @xmath51 ( peaks below @xmath10 ) and @xmath52 ( peaks above @xmath10 ) .",
    "the shaded regions mark the locations of pairs of adjacent @xmath53 and @xmath54 modes .",
    "the frequency intervals between these regions provide a visual estimate of the observed large separation .",
    "evidently , it is the spectrum above @xmath10 that conforms with the expected average separation .",
    "the second check relates to the relative power shown by adjacent @xmath53 and @xmath54 modes . within each pair ,",
    "the @xmath54 mode lies at higher frequency . we expect to see more power in the @xmath54 mode than in its @xmath53 counterpart . whilst predictions of the exact power ratios are rendered uncertain by the complexities of non - adibatic calculations , observed ratios are usually",
    "not too far from the @xmath55-to-1 ratio expected from the assumption of energy equipartition and geometric cancellation of the perturbations on the visible stellar disc ( when projected on to spherical harmonic functions , with an appropriate limb - darkening law ; e.g. , see aerts et al .",
    "2009 ) . unless the star is observed with the rotation axis along the line - of - sight , power shown by the @xmath53 modes will be spread across several components ( e.g. , gizon & solanki 2003 ) .",
    "the ratio in total power then tends to be exaggerated in the frequency power spectrum because it is the _ maximum _ power spectral densities , i.e. , the heights of the mode peaks , that are immediately apparent from a visual inspection .",
    "inspection of the mode pairs in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] again implies that the spectrum above @xmath56 is the true one : the @xmath54 modes , the higher - frequency modes in each marked pair , have the higher observed powers .",
    "how far above @xmath10 might we hope to detect solar - like oscillations in the lc _ kepler _ data ?",
    "a combination of several factors means that pushing the limit well above @xmath10 is challenging .",
    "first , the sinc - function attenuation due to the finite integration time leads to significant reduction of the observed oscillation amplitudes at frequencies above @xmath10 .",
    "second , the impact of the sinc attenuation is exacerbated by the fact that the intrinsic maximum amplitudes of solar - like oscillations decrease with increasing @xmath48 . and",
    "third , we must also contend with background power aliased from the region below @xmath10 , which has contributions from stellar granulation , stellar activity , shot and instrumental noise .",
    "note that any non - white or `` red '' noise component , such as the granulation , will also have a contribution above @xmath10 that is sinc - function attenuated , just like the oscillations ( e.g. , see kallinger et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "we come back to the example of kic4351319 to help illustrate these points .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] shows clearly the attenuated power of the oscillations in the lc spectrum of kic4351319 , relative to those observed in the sc spectrum .",
    "the impact of the sinc - function attenuation on the observed s / n is compounded in the lc spectrum because the background in the region of @xmath48 is the aliased background from lower frequencies , which is dominated by granulation _ and _ is much higher  by more than an order of magnitude  than the shot - noise background .",
    "the spectrum of the oscillations is in reality coincident in frequency with the lower - power , higher - frequency part of the granulation spectrum , as shown by the sc spectrum of kic4351319 .",
    "a much higher s / n is therefore observed in the oscillations when using sc data , because we do not have to contend with aliasing of power from the lower - frequency , higher - power part of the granulation spectrum .",
    "our tests indicate that it is only when @xmath57 is fainter than approximately 11 to 12mag that the photon shot noise becomes an important factor in determining the detectability of the modes in the lc super - nyquist regime .",
    "= 11.0 cm    from the observed sc spectrum of kic4351319 we may construct an ( almost ) accurate prediction of the lc spectrum .",

    "( note we have not bothered to attempt to discriminate the white contribution due to shot noise , since it is very small compared to the other contributions . ) the predicted lc power below @xmath10 is given by adding the sub - nyquist sc attenuated power to the aliased , super - nyquist attenuated spectrum from above @xmath10 ( after reflecting the latter about @xmath10 ) .",

    "signatures of a few modes are just detectable in its lc spectrum .",
    "this case marks the approximate upper @xmath48 limit for making detections in the archival _ kepler _ data .",
    "things become much more challenging as we move to higher frequencies , to the region where @xmath48 straddles or lies close to the boundary at @xmath29 .",
    "imposing a high - pass filter to suppress the very - low frequency background power in the sub - nyquist regime does not help to improve the s / n in the super - nyquist regime : the filtering response is the same in each domain of @xmath10 and so any oscillation signal is also filtered .",
    "we have considered the prospects for detecting solar - like oscillations in the undersampled `` super - nyquist '' regime of long - cadence ( lc ) _ kepler _ data , i.e. , _ above _ the lc nyquist frequency of @xmath0 .",

    "the oscillations are then oversampled , since the associated nyquist frequency of @xmath4 lies well above the frequencies of the detectable oscillations . however , the number of sc available target slots is very limited : indeed , there are around only 50 targets of interest in the _ kepler _ archive that have detected oscillations in sc data and @xmath48 between the lc @xmath33 and @xmath82 . in most of these cases",
    "there is only 1month of data from the initial asteroseismic survey phase .",
    "this precludes very detailed studies of these targets , which demands high - frequency - resolution datasets for analyses of individual modes ( including rotational frequency splittings ) .    the exploitation of the archival _ kepler _ and new k2 data for lc super - nyquist studies offers the prospect of increasing significantly the number of evolved subgiant and low - luminosity red - giant targets available for asteroseismic study .",
    "by making use of the revised catalogue of _ kepler _ star properties in huber et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , we estimate that up to 400 targets may be available for study in the _ kepler _ archive .",
