    "in the study of an oriented compact 3-manifold @xmath0 with torus boundary , the ( relative ) fundamental homology 3-class @xmath1 $ ] in @xmath2 essentially has basic information . to further analyze it quantitatively , relative viewpoints are usually practice : to describe this , we suppose a pair of groups @xmath3 and a homomorphism @xmath4 , which sends every boundary elements in @xmath5 to some elements in @xmath6 .",
    "then , for any relative group 3-cocycle @xmath7 with local coefficients ( see for the explicit definition ) , we can consider the following pairing valued in the coinvariant @xmath8 : @xmath9 \\rangle \\in a_g= a/\\ { a - g\\cdot a \\}_{a \\in a , \\",

    "furthermore , this paring includes the triple cup products of the form @xmath11 ; see @xcite .",
    "in addition , if @xmath12 is of finite order , the pairing is called _ the dijkgraaf - witten invariant _ @xcite , as a toy model of tqft .    however , the paring in the general situation is often considered to be far from being computable . actually , we come up against difficulties : first , it is troublesome to explicitly describe a ( truncated ) triangulation in @xmath13 , which represents the 3-class @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "moreover , the 3-class @xmath14 $ ] is not always unique , but depends on the choices of @xmath15 decorations , as mentioned in @xcite ; next , the boundary condition is important ; when dealing with the condition , we mostly need long and verbose explanations , as in @xcite ( cf . homotopy quantum field theory @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , since the relative homology is defined from some projective resolution ( see  [ s11 ] ) , it is essentially a critical problem to choose an appreciate resolution and to find a presentation of the 3-cocycle @xmath16 .",
    "further , even if we can succeed in doing so on @xmath17 , such presentations are mostly quite intricate .",

    "malnormal property \" as a broad class ( i.e. , hyperbolic links ) , we succeed in giving a computation of the pairing ; see theorem [ mainthm1 ] ( however , in cable cases we need some conditions ; see  [ 2734 ] , cf . cabling formula @xcite ) . here",
    ", we stress that the computation is constructed from only a choice of a link diagram of @xmath21 , while the construction needs no triangulation of @xmath23 .",
    "more precisely , the result is summarized to that , if we know the presentation of @xmath24 and the jsj decomposition of @xmath25 , we can compute the pairing from a diagram ; see  [ 23433 ] .",
    "let us roughly explain our approach to the theorem . as seen in @xcite , quandle theory @xcite and homology @xcite have advantages to some diagrammatic computation in knot theory .",
    "thus , inspired by the works @xcite , we will construct a bridge between the quandle and group homologies using chain maps , in order to reduce the 3-class @xmath26 $ ] to a quandle 3-class .",

    ", this paper points out ( theorem [ mainthm133 ] ) that  malnormal \" property of groups is a suitable condition for obtaining a quasi inverse in the zigzag ; see  [ 23433 ] ( here , we are based on @xcite which studied malnormal property of knots ) . to summarize",
    ", composing the chain maps give the required computation of the pairing .",
    "in applications , we obtain four advantages from the approaches as follows .",
    "first , the previous composite gives an algorithm to algebraically describe the fundamental 3-class @xmath27 $ ] for hyperbolic links ; see  [ 238 ] .",
    "next , our results emphasize topological advantages of the quandle cocycle invariant @xcite . especially , for malnormal pairs ( @xmath28 ) , we will give a method to produce many quandle cocycles , and obtain an easier formulation of computing the pairing ( see theorem [ mainthm133 ] ) .",
    "the third is some results of determining the third homology of the link quandle @xmath29 , where @xmath21 is a knot or a hyperbolic link .",
    "this quandle @xmath29 is analogous to the fundamental groups ( defined in @xcite ) , and play a key role in the proof of the main theorems ; see appendix [ 2343136 ] for details .",
    "the forth one is to show a generalization and applications of the work @xcite . to be precise ,",
    "although the paper @xcite showed the same theorem in only the case @xmath30 , we point out the generalization applicable for malnormality as mentioned above .",

    "we often suppose orientation , and denote @xmath34 by @xmath35 * in short , the fundamentals group @xmath36 is abbreviated to @xmath37 , and the complement space @xmath38 is often done to @xmath39 * furthermore , fix a pherihedral group , @xmath40 , with respect to @xmath41 , which is generated by a meridian - longitude pair @xmath42 .",
    "* moreover , we fix a group @xmath12 and subgroups @xmath43 with @xmath44 , and suppose a homomorphism @xmath45 such that @xmath46 .",

    "then , the main statement is as follows :    ( 100,80 ) ( -82,35)@xmath62 ( -51,63)@xmath63 ( -24,62)@xmath64 ( -90,33 )    ( 101,36)@xmath62 ( 135,62)@xmath64 ( 135,11)@xmath63    -1.737pc    [ mainthm1 ] assume that @xmath21 is either a prime non - cable knot is _ cable _ , if there is a solid torus @xmath65 embedded in @xmath20 such that @xmath65 contains @xmath66 as the @xmath67-torus knot for some @xmath68 furthermore , a knot @xmath21 is _ prime _ , if it can not be written as the knot sum of two non - trivial knots .",
    "incidentally , the assumption in the theorems relies on theorem [ tuu333 ] of @xcite and the jsj decomposition ; see  [ 23433 ] . ] or a hyperbolic link .",
    "then , for any relative group 3-cocycle @xmath69 , there is a map @xmath70 for which the following equality holds in the coinvariant @xmath71 : @xmath72 \\rangle = \\psi_{\\phi_{\\theta } } ( d ) \\in a_g.\\ ] ]    in conclusion , the right hand side ensures a computation of the pairing , with describing no triangulation .",
    "thus , it is important to present @xmath73 concretely ; in sections [ 23433][s33 ] , we give a concrete presentation of @xmath73 for such links .",
    "however , the map @xmath73 is abstractly obtained from homology algebra without functoriality on @xmath49 , and essentially depends on the link type of @xmath21 .",
    "actually , even for the figure eight knot @xmath21 , the map @xmath73 is a sum of many terms ; see section [ 238 ] .",
    "incidentally , section [ 2734 ] similarly discusses the cable cases and concludes a similar statement ( theorem [ mainthm5 ] ) . here",
    ", we see that the statement essentially turns out to be modulo some integers , and to have no more information than the homology of cyclic groups .",

    "the construction of @xmath134 in theorem [ mainthm1 ] relies on relative group homology .",
