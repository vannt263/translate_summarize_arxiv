    "meson physics and the strong interactions have been intimately connected since pions were first introduced by yukawa to explain the inter - nucleon force ( yukawa , 1935 ) . since that time",
    ", our knowledge of mesons and in parallel , our understanding of the strong interactions , has undergone several major revisions .",
    "our present understanding of the strong interactions is that it is described by the non - abelian gauge field theory quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ( fritzch , 1971 ; gross , 1973 ; weinberg , 1973 ) which describes the interactions of quarks and gluons .",
    "once again , it appears that mesons are the ideal laboratory for the study of strong interactions in the strongly coupled non - perturbative regime . even though in qcd we have a theory of the strong interactions , we know very little about the physical states of the theory .",
    "until we can both predict the properties of the physical states of the theory and confirm these predictions by experiment we can hardly claim to understand qcd .",
    "the understanding of qcd has implications beyond hadron physics .",
    "for example , it is possible that at high energies the weak interactions become strong , so that strongly interacting field theories may be relevant to the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . in qcd",
    "we have an example of such a theory where we can test our understanding against experiment .",
    "the study of meson spectroscopy is the laboratory that will hopefully elucidate this theory .    to a large extent",
    "our knowledge of hadron physics is based on phenomenological models and in particular , the constituent quark model ( g. zweig , 1964 ; m. gell - mann , 1964 ) .",
    "meson and baryon spectroscopy is described surprisingly well as composite objects made of constituent objects  valence quarks .",
    "we will refer to these hadrons , described by only valence quark configurations , as `` conventional '' .",
    "most qcd motivated models , however , predict other types of hadrons with explicit glue degrees of freedom .",
    "these are the _ glueballs _ , which have no constituent quarks in them at all and are entirely described in terms of gluonic fields , and _ hybrids _ which have both constituent quarks and excited gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "it is the prospect of these new forms of hadronic matter that has led to continued excitement among hadron spectroscopists .    to be able to interpret the nature of new resonances",
    "it is important that we have a template against which to compare observed states with theoretical predictions .",
    "the constituent quark model offers the most complete description of hadron properties and is probably the most successful phenomenological model of hadron structure . but to use it as a template to find new physics , it is very important that we test the quark model against known states to understand its strengths and weaknesses . at one extreme ,",
    "if we find that there is too much discrepancy with experiment , we may decide that it is not such a good model after all , and we should start over again . on the other hand , if it gives general agreement with experiment , discrepancies may indicate the need for new physics ; either because approximations to the model are not appropriate , or new types of hadrons which can not be explained by the quark model . to understand our reliance on this very simple , and",
    "perhaps naive , model it is useful to look at the historical evolution of our understanding of hadron physics .",
    "mesons were first introduced by yukawa ( yukawa 1935 ) with pions acting as the exchange bosons responsible for the strong interactions between nucleons . with the advent of higher energy accelerators ,",
    "a whole zoo of mesons and baryons appeared , leading to a confused state of understanding .",
    "eventually , by arranging the various mesons and baryons into multiplets according to their quantum numbers , patterns started to emerge .",
    "it was recognized that hadrons of a given @xmath0 arranged themselves into representations of the group su(3 ) although none of the observed states seemed to correspond to the fundamental triplet representation . in an important conceptual leap zweig ( zweig , 1964 ) and",
    "gell - man ( gell - man , 1964 ) postulated that mesons and baryons were in fact composite objects with mesons made of a quark - antiquark pair and baryons made of three quarks .",
    "zweig referred to these constituent spin @xmath1 fermions as aces and gell - man referred to them as quarks . by taking this simple picture seriously ,",
    "the qualitative properties of hadrons were explained quite well .",
    "serious problems remained however .",
    "in the `` naive '' quark model the spin @xmath2 baryons , the constituent quarks spin wavefunctions were symmetric as were their flavour wavefunctions .",
    "being fermions , the baryon wavefunction should be antisymmetric in the quark quantum numbers .",
    "this would imply that either quarks obeyed some sort of bizzare para - statistics or that the ground state spatial wavefunction was antisymmetric . yet",
    "no reasonable models could be constructed to give this result . to avoid this result ,",
    "greenberg postulated that quarks had another quantum number which he named colour , with respect to which the quark wavefunctions could be antisymmetrized ( greenberg , 1964 ) .",
    "the serious shortcoming of this model was that no quarks were observed .",
    "most physicists took the view that if they could not be observed they were nothing more than a convenient bookkeeping device .    by the beginning of the 1970",
    "s it was becoming clear that the weak interactions could be explained by gauge theories ( glashow 1961 , weinberg 1967 , salam 1968 ) .",
    "if this was the case , it seemed reasonable that the strong interactions should also be described using the same formalism .",
    "`` gauging '' the colour degree of freedom leads to quantum chromodynamics , a non - abelian gauge theory based on the group su(3 ) , as the theory of the strong interactions ( fritzch , 1971 ; gross , 1973 ; weinberg , 1973 ) .",
    "nevertheless there was still considerable skepticism about the existence of quarks since they had never been seen .",
    "this situation changed when in november 1974 very narrow hadron resonances were discovered simultaneously at brookhaven national laboratory ( aubert 1974 ) and the stanford linear accelerator center ( augustin 1974 ) .",
    "these states , named the @xmath3 , were quickly interpreted as being bound states of a new heavy quark the charm quark .",
    "quark models which incorporated the qualitative features of qcd , asymptotic freedom and confinement , where able to reproduce the charmonium @xmath4 spectrum rather well .",
    "( appelquist 1975a , 1975b , 1975c , eichten 1975 ) .",
    "these developments , both experimental and theoretical , convinced all but a few that quarks were real objects and were the building blocks of hadronic matter . in a seminal paper on the subject , derujula ,",
    "georgi , and glashow , ( de rjula 1975 ) showed that these ideas could successfully be used to describe the phenomenology of light quark spectroscopy .    with the acceptance that qcd is the theory of the strong interactions",
    "comes the need to understand its physical states . understanding the spectrum of hadrons reveals information on the non - perturbative aspects of qcd .",
    "unfortunately , calculating the properties of hadrons from the qcd lagrangean has proven to be a very difficult task in this strongly coupled non - linear theory . in the long term ,",
    "the most promising technique is formulating the theory on a discrete space - time lattice ( creutz 1983a , 1983b , kogut 1979 , 1983 , montvay 1994 ) . by constructing interpolating fields with the quantum numbers of physical hadrons and evaluating their correlations on the lattice one is able to calculate hadron properties from first principles .",
    "although a great deal of progress has been made , these calculations take enormous amounts of computer time and progress has been slow .",
    "additionally , a disadvantage of this approach is that one may obtain numerical results without any corresponding physical insight .",
    "a less rigorous approach which has proven to be quite useful and reasonably successful , has been to use phenomenological models of hadron structure to describe hadron properties .",
    "these models predict , in addition to the conventional @xmath5 mesons and @xmath6 baryons of the quark model ; multiquark states , glueballs , and hybrids .",
    "probably the most pressing question in hadron spectroscopy is whether these states do in fact exist and what their properties are .",
    "however , the predictions of the various models can differ appreciably so that experiment is needed to point the model builders in the right direction",
    ".    we will often refer to glueballs and hybrids as exotics because they lie outside the constituent quark model .",
    "however they are not exotics in the sense that if they exist they are simply additional hadronic states expected from qcd .",
    "nevertheless , from the historical development of the field we see that the quark model provides a good framework on which to base further study .",
    "if we find discrepancies everywhere it obviously fails and we should abandon it as a tool .",
    "on the other hand , since it does work reasonably well it gives us a criteria on which to decide if we have discovered the new forms of hadronic matter we are interested in ; namely glueballs and hybrids .",
    "the present situation in light meson spectroscopy is that the constituent quark model works surprisingly well in describing most observed states . at the same time",
    "there are still many problems and puzzles that need to be understood and that might signal physics beyond the quark model .",
    "although most qcd based models expect glueballs and hybrids and there is mounting evidence that some have been found , thus far no observed state has unambiguously been identified as one .",
    "the best candidates are states with `` exotic quantum numbers '' , that is states which can not be formed in the quark model .",
    "part of the problem and confusion is that the conventional mesons are not understood well enough to rule out new states as conventional states and part of the problem is that these exotics may have properties which have made them difficult to find up to now . despite these qualifications ,",
    "there has been considerable recent progress in understanding the properties of exotic mesons that could help distinguish between conventional and exotic mesons . with sufficient evidence , a strong case can be made to label an experimentally observed state as an exotic hadron .",
    "thus , to have any hope of distinguishing between conventional and exotic mesons it is crucial that we understand conventional meson spectroscopy very well .",
    "the purpose of this review is to summarize the present status of meson spectroscopy and identify puzzles , perhaps pointing out measurements which could help resolve them . to this end",
    "we will begin with a discussion of the theoretical ingredients relevant to this article .",
    "in the course of this review we will refer to numerous experiments so in section iii we briefly survey relevant experiments along with the attributes that contribute useful information to the study of mesons . since the eventual goal is to identify discrepancies between the observed meson spectrum and conventional quark model predictions , in section iv we will compare the predictions of one specific quark model with experiment .",
    "this will allow us to identify discrepancies between the quark model and experiment which may signal physics beyond conventional hadron spectroscopy .",
    "in section v we will go over these puzzles in detail to help decide whether the discrepancy is most likely a problem with the model , with a confused state in experiment , or whether it most likely signals some interesting new physics .",
    "in section vi we will briefly outline some future facilities for the study of meson spectroscopy that are under construction or that are being considered .",
    "finally , in section vii we will attempt to summarize our most interesting findings .",
    "our hope is that the reader will see that meson spectroscopy is a vibrant field .    because of the breadth of this review we can only touch the surface of many interesting topics .",
    "there are a number of recent reviews of meson spectroscopy and related topics with emphasis somewhat different from that of the present one .",
    "we strongly encourage the interested reader to refer to these reviews for further details .",
    "the reader is referred to the reviews by f. close ( 1988 ) , s. cooper ( 1988 ) , b. diekmann ( 1988 ) , t. burnett and s. sharpe ( burnett 1990 ) , n. trnqvist ( 1990 ) , c. amsler and f. myhrer ( 1991 ) , k. konigsman ( 1991 ) , r. landau ( 1996 ) , c. amsler ( 1998 ) , and barnes ( 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , the review of particle physics ( particle data group ( pdg ) , caso 1998 ) contains a wealth of information on the properties of mesons in its tables of properties and mini - reviews on topics of special interest and should be consulted for further information .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of the strong interactions , ( fritzch 1971 , gross 1973 , weinberg 1973 ) may be thought of as a generalization of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , our most successful physical theory .",
    "qcd is described by the lagrangean ; @xmath7 where @xmath8 @xmath9 are the gluon fields which transform according to the adjoint representation of su(3 ) with a=1, ... ,8 , @xmath10 are the quark fields with colour indices i=1,2,3 , @xmath11 is the bare coupling , @xmath12 is the quark mass , and @xmath13 are the generators of su(3 ) .",
    "one immediately observes that quarks couple to gluons in much the same way as the electron couples to photons with @xmath14 of qed replaced by @xmath15 of qcd .",
    "the significant difference between qed and qcd is that in qcd the quarks come in coloured triplets and the gluons in a colour octet where colour is labelled by the latin subscripts .",
    "the non - abelian group structure of su(3 ) leads to nonlinear terms in the field strength @xmath16 , which give rise to trilinear and quadratic vertices in the theory so that gluons couple to themselves in addition to interacting with quarks .",
    "this makes the theory nonlinear , very difficult to solve and leads to the confinement of colour .",
    "a consequence of this behavior appears to be the existence of new forms of hadronic matter with excited gluonic degrees of freedom known as glueballs and hybrids ( close 1988 ) .    because of the difficulties in solving qcd exactly to obtain the properties of the physical states of the theory , we have resorted to various approximation methods . the most promising of these is to redefine the problem on a discrete spacetime lattice , in analogy to the approach one might take in the numerical solution of a difficult differential equation ( wilson 1974 , creutz 1983a , 1983b , kogut 1979 , 1983 , c. michael 1995 , 1997 , montvay 1994 ) . for qcd , one formulates the problem in terms of the path integral in euclidean space - time and evaluates expectation values of the appropriate operators using a monte - carlo integration over the field configurations .",
    "although progress is being made on the problem , it requires enormous computer capacity so that progress is slow in making precise , detailed predictions of the properties of the physical states of the theory . as a consequence ,",
    "our understanding of hadrons continues to rely on insights obtained from experiment and qcd motivated models in addition to lattice qcd results .    in later sections we will use the predictions of",
    "qcd inspired models as the basis for interpreting the nature of the observed mesons .",
    "it is therefore useful to sketch the qcd motivation for these models .",
    "we start with the quark - antiquark ( @xmath17 ) potential in the limit of infinitely massive quarks which can be used in the schrdinger equation to obtain the spectroscopy of heavy quarkonium .",
    "this is analogous to the adiabatic potentials for diatomic molecules in molecular physics with the heavy quarks corresponding to slow moving nuclei and the gluonic fields corresponding to fast moving electrons .",
    "the @xmath17 potential is found by calculating the energy of a fixed , infinitely heavy , quark - antiquark pair given by the expectation value of what is known as the wilson loop operator ( wilson 1974 ) .",
    "the resulting potential is referred to as the static potential since the massive quarks do not move . limiting cases of the static potential",
    "are given by : @xmath18 where the constant @xmath19 , the `` string tension '' , is numerically found to be @xmath20  gev@xmath21 @xmath22 0.9  gev / fm and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the strong coupling .",
    "the result of one such lattice calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] , taken from ( bali , 1997 ) . the lattice potential , @xmath25 ,",
    "can then be used to determine the spectrum of @xmath26 mesons by solving the schrdinger equation since the @xmath19-quark motion is approximately non - relativistic .",
    "there are also spin dependent forces between the quarks analogous to the spin dependent forces in the hydrogen atom which give rise to the fine and hyperfine structure in atomic spectroscopy . to obtain the spin dependent potentials in qcd",
    "the wilson loop is expanded in the inverse quark mass which gives the terms next order in an expansion in @xmath27 ( eichten 1979 , 1981 , gromes 1984a , 1984b ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the quark and antiquark spins and relative orbital angular momentum and @xmath25 is the interquark potential defined by the wilson loop operator .",
    "the spin dependent potentials , @xmath32 , can be related to correlation functions of the colour electric and colour magnetic fields .",
    "for example @xmath33 and @xmath34 are given by ( eichten 1979 , 1981 , gromes 1984a , 1984b ) : @xmath35 which can be evaluated using nonperturbative techniques , in particular lattice qcd .",
    "the lattice results can be compared to the phenomenological expectations that the magnetic correlations are short range as expected from one gluon exchange : @xmath36 the lattice results do indeed agree with these spin dependent potentials ( bali 1997 , campostrini 1986 , 1987 ) .",
    "bali schilling and wachter ( bali 1997 ) have studied the @xmath26 and @xmath37 spectra using the potentials calculated using lattice qcd .",
    "they solved the schrdinger equation using the spin - independent potential and treated the spin - dependent and other relativistic corrections ( not discussed here ) as perturbations .",
    "the resulting beautyonium spectrum is shown in fig  [ fig : lat - b ] and is found to be in reasonable agreement with the experimental @xmath38 spectrum .",
    "the main deviations between experiment and prediction are due to the quenched approximation and the neglect of higher order relativistic corrections",
    ". direct lattice calculations of spin - dependent splittings also agree with the measured splittings ( davies 1998 ) .",
    "although historically , the spin dependent potentials were obtained phenomenologically by comparing the observed quarkonium spectrum ( @xmath37 and @xmath26 ) to the predictions of potential models , it turns out that the resulting potentials are in reasonable agreement with those obtained from lattice qcd .",
    "the phenomenological spin - dependent potential typically assumes a lorentz vector one gluon exchange for the short distance piece which results in terms analogous to the breit - fermi hamiltonian in atomic physics , and a lorentz scalar linear confining piece .",
    "the resulting spin dependent hamiltonian is then of the form : @xmath39 where @xmath40 } \\right\\ } \\label{eq : hyp}\\ ] ] is the colour hyperfine interaction , @xmath41 is the spin - orbit colour magnetic piece arising from the one - gluon exchange and @xmath42 is the spin - orbit thomas precession term where @xmath25 is the interquark potential given by the wilson loop . note that the contribution arising from one gluon exchange is of opposite sign to the contribution from the confining potential .",
    "@xmath43 is the running coupling constant of qcd .",
    "because of confinement only colour singlet objects can exist as physical hadrons .",
    "coloured quarks form the fundamental triplet @xmath44 representation of the su(3 ) colour gauge group and antiquarks the conjugate @xmath45 representation . therefore",
    ", a quark - antiquark pair can combine to form a colour singlet as can three quarks while a quark - quark pair can not .",
    "other states are also possible , for example @xmath46 , and it is dynamical question whether such multiquark systems are realized in nature as single multiquark states , as two distinct @xmath5 states , or as a loosely associated system of colour singlet mesons analogous to a diatomic molecule .",
    "colour singlets can also be constructed with gluons ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "glueballs are hadrons with no valence quark content and hybrids are made up of valence quarks and antiquarks and an explicit gluon degree of freedom .",
    "of course , life is not so simple , and there is apriori no reason that the physical mesons can not be linear combinations of @xmath5 , @xmath46 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .      in the constituent quark model ,",
    "conventional mesons are bound states of a spin @xmath1 quark and a spin @xmath1 antiquark bound by a qcd motivated phenomenological potential such as the one described above .",
    "the quark and antiquark spins combine into a spin singlet or triplet with total spin @xmath50 or 1 respectively .",
    "@xmath51 is coupled to the orbital angular momentum @xmath52 resulting in total angular momentum @xmath53 for the singlet state and @xmath54 for the triplet states . in spectroscopic notation the resulting state",
    "is denoted by @xmath55 with s for @xmath56 , p for @xmath57 , d for @xmath58 , and f , g , h , for @xmath59 etc .",
    "parity is given by @xmath60 and c - parity is also defined for neutral self - conjugate mesons and is given by @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the ground state vector meson with @xmath62 is the @xmath63 quark model state .",
    "the light - quark quarkonia are composed of @xmath64 , @xmath65 or @xmath66 quarks . since the @xmath64 and @xmath65 quarks are quite similar in mass , @xmath67  mev , which is much smaller than the intrinsic mass scale of qcd , it is convenient to treat them as members of an `` isosopin '' doublet with the resulting su(2 ) isospin an approximate symmetry of the strong interactions . combining @xmath68 and @xmath69 into mesons forms isospin singlet and triplet multiplets .",
    "we will use the symbol @xmath70 ( for non - strangeness ) to generically stand for @xmath64 or @xmath65 .",
    "thus , one should read @xmath71 with @xmath72 for the isoscalar mesons and @xmath73 for the neutral member of the isovector multiplet .    when dealing with the charged members of an isospin triplet , it is customary to refer to their @xmath74-parity as the @xmath74-parity of the neutral member of the multiplet , @xmath75 .",
    "it is convenient , however , to introduce a new quantum number , @xmath76 .",
    "the so - called @xmath77-parity is defined , and has the same value , for all members of the multiplet .",
    "it is important to note , however , that unlike @xmath74-parity , @xmath77-parity is _ not _ an exact symmetry of the strong interaction because of the inherent approximate nature of isospin .",
    "hadrons containing @xmath66 quarks have similar properties to the @xmath78 systems so that mesons are arranged into @xmath79 flavour nonets ; three isovector states @xmath80 , two isoscalar states @xmath81 , and four strange @xmath82 states @xmath83 . with the heavier strange quark mass , the @xmath84",
    "isoscalar states are sufficiently heavier than the @xmath85 @xmath5 states that there is little mixing between @xmath84 and the light @xmath86 states with the exception of the @xmath87 system where @xmath88 @xmath89 where the flavour mixing angle @xmath90 .",
    "these states are often also expressed as linear combinations of flavour su(3 ) octet and singlet states @xmath91 @xmath92 the two angles are trivially related by @xmath93 .    combining the spin and orbital angular momentum wavefunctions with the quark flavour wavefunctions results in the meson states of table [ tb : qn ] where we have used the particle data group naming conventions ( pdg , caso 1998 ) .",
    "states not fitting into this picture are considered to be `` exotics '' .",
    "thus , a meson with @xmath94 would be forbidden in the constituent quark model as would a doubly charged meson @xmath95 .",
    ".the quantum numbers and names of conventional @xmath5 mesons . [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the da@xmath96ne @xmath97 factory ( zallo 1992 ) , a high luminosity @xmath98 collider operating at @xmath99  gev , is nearing completion at infn - frascati . the main goal is to study cp - violation , but it will also examine the nature of the @xmath100 and @xmath101 scalar mesons through the radiative transitions @xmath102 .",
    "see ( achasov , 1997a ) .",
    "@xmath97 factories also offer the possibility of studying low mass @xmath103 production via two photon production .",
    "the combination of relatively high luminosity with detectors optimized for detecting low momenta and energies should allow very detailed measurements of both charged and neutral modes to be made from threshold up to nearly 1 gev .",
    "this process can shed additional light on low mass scalar resonances .",
    "although the primary motivation for a @xmath104 factory ( goldberg and stone , 1989 ; bauer 1990 , 1992 ) is to study cp violation in the b meson system , light meson spectroscopy will also be addressed several ways .",
    "final states produced in the strong _ and _ weak decays of @xmath19 and @xmath105 quarks will elucidate the structure of the light meson daughters .",
    "further , these high luminosity facilities will study two - photon processes with very high statistics .",
    "lastly , exclusive radiative processes @xmath106 providing information complementary to @xmath3 radiative decay .",
    "three such facilities in the final stages of construction are the cleo - iii upgrade at cesr , the new babar detector at the slac asymmetric collider , and a new facility at kek .",
    "cleo - iii is an upgraded detector to go along with a luminosity boost in the cesr storage ring , a classic and well - understood symmetric @xmath98 collider facility .",
    "the slac @xmath104-factory is an asymmetric system ( designed to boost @xmath104-mesons in the lab frame ) which has some implications for detection of lower mass sytems , such as those produced in two - photon annihilation .",
    "the kek facility ( kurokawa , 1997 ) is similar to the slac experiment .",
    "we also note that the lep collaborations have made contributions to the subject of light meson spectroscopy and we should expect this to continue for at least the next several years .",
    "cern is about to commission a new experiment on fixed targets to be operated in the years prior to turn - on of lhc .",
    "the * co*mmon * m*uon and * p*roton * a*pparatus for * s*tructure and * s*pectroscopy ( compass ) is a large magnetic system designed to detect multiparticle final states using either muon or proton beams ( von  harrach , 1998 ) .",
    "the muon beam program is mainly directed at measurements of spin structure functions , but the proton beams will be used for a number of hadronic production experiments , in particular central production .",
    "operating such a multi - purpose apparatus has specific challenges , mainly trying to optimize sensitivies to the different situations .",
    "however , using a common apparatus with a large directed collaboration has lead to a state - of - the - art high rate detector with excellent momentum and particle identification capabilities .",
    "first runs with hadron beams are expected in 1999 .",
    "central production measurements including a rich detector for particle identification are presently planned for 2002 .",
    "the @xmath107 dependence of two - photon production from charged particles implies an enormous cross section in heavy ion interactions .",
    "however the luminosiites at heavy ion colliders are substantially less than the @xmath98 factories so that in the end these two factors tend to balance out leaving the rates for two - photon physics generally lower than present @xmath98 facilities .",
    "still , reasonable event totals may be expected when integrating over the long running periods , with a suitably triggered detector .",
    "the real strength of heavy - ion colliders may be the ability to compare the gluon - rich pomeron - pomeron interactions with gluon - poor photon - photon interactions in the same experiment .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl is nearing completion , and at least one detector ( star ) will be able to trigger on low mass , low multiplicity events from two - photon interactions and central production ( nystrand and klein , 1988 ) .",
    "peripheral hadronic production experiments still have plenty to contribute , particularly using state of the art detection systems .",
    "this is particularly true if they can look at production mechanisms and final states that have been largely ignored in the past .",
    "this has been aptly demonstrated by e852 at bnl , for example .",
    "it is also important to recognize the lessons taught by the lass experiment as slac which , among other things , demonstrated the effectiveness of a programmatic approach and the value of analyzing many different channels in the same experiment under conditions of uniform and well understood acceptance .",
    "future experiments should follow these models .",
    "the most promising scenario for such developments is the japanese hadron facility ( jhf ) which has been proposed for kek .",
    "this would be a high intensity ( 10  @xmath108a ) 50  gev proton synchrotron , including polarized beams . for comparison , the ags at brookhaven , one of the primary workhorses of spectroscopy through peripheral hadroproduction , produces a few @xmath108a proton beam , but with energy around 25  gev .",
    "the higher energy is worth large factors in the secondary @xmath109 and @xmath110 beams at 20  gev or so .",
    "peripheral photoproduction is conspicuously absent among the studied production mechanisms in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "this is despite the fact that one expects profound new results from such experiments , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ seciii : photons ] .",
    "the reason , however , is obvious .",
    "until recently , virtually no suitable facilities have existed for detailed work in this area .",
    "the continuous electron beam accelerator facility ( cebaf ) at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jefferson lab ) is a very high intensity electron beam facility with 46 gev electron beams .",
    "the beam energy was centered around the laboratory s original primary goal , i.e the study nuclear structure . however , because of landmark improvements in the the rf accleration cavities , beams with energies up to @xmath1118  gev will be possible with minimal cost .",
    "in fact , a plan is in place to push the electron beam energy initially to 12  gev , and hopefully later to 24  gev .",
    "high energy photons can be produced by either thin - radiator bremstrahlung or through a variety of other means .",
    "an aggressive experimental plan is underway which will keep pace with the accelerator improvements .",
    "this involves the construction of a new experimental hall at the site , which would include a dedicated experimental facility .",
    "initial designs of this facility take directly from the lass and e852 experiences , with necessary modifications for photon beams .",
    "state - of - the - art high rate data acquisition electronics and computing will be an integral part of this new experiment .      @xmath112-charm factories , @xmath98 colliders operating in the energy region of 34 gev , have been proposed although none have yet been approved .",
    "@xmath112-charm factories will produce large numbers of @xmath3 and @xmath113 mesons .",
    "the bepc ring in china , presently home to the bes experiment , has worked well and is considered a prototype for a higher luminosity facility at that laboratory .",
    "present designs call for between a factor of 10 and 100 improvement in the luminosity over the present storage ring .",
    "the project is not yet approved , however .",
    "hadron spectroscopy can be pursued in several ways at the @xmath112/charm factory .",
    "these include @xmath3 and @xmath114 decays , decays of @xmath115 where the hadrons are produced by a virtual w boson , and semileptonic and leptonic decays of @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "probably the most important question in light meson spectroscopy is the existence of gluonic excitations , and as demonstrated earlier in this review , @xmath118 is a critical reaction for the complete understanding of these states .    with the high statistics available it may even be possible to perform a partial wave analysis of the @xmath119 decay products produced in @xmath120 radiative decays .",
    "for example @xmath121 is sensitive to the hybrid exotic sector @xmath122 while @xmath123 would be a source of @xmath124 mesons .",
    "in addition to high statistics searches for gluonic excitations a @xmath112-charm factory will also study the properties of the @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 mesons via hadronic decays of the @xmath112 lepton .",
    "these observations will help disentangle the radially excitations of the vector mesons .",
    "in this review we hope to have conveyed the sense that meson spectroscopy is a lively , exciting subject with even the most basic questions still unresolved .",
    "we find it remarkable , that after over 20 years of qcd we still do not know what are the physical states of the theory .",
    "understanding qcd , and non - abelian gauge theories in general , is one of the most important problems facing high energy and nuclear physics .",
    "we outlined the important issues in light meson spectroscopy , the puzzles , and the open questions .",
    "we have attempted so show where the field is heading with the next generation of experiments and how they can advance our knowledge of mesons spectroscopy . in many cases , it is not only our lack of experimental data but a lack of answers to theoretical questions that has hindered progress in the field .",
    "we have attempted to point these out .",
    "our survey of established meson states shows the basic validity of the constituent quark model .",
    "however , the survey also highlights some possible discrepancies with the predictions of the quark model which may point to the need to go beyond the @xmath5 states and include gluonic excitations and multiquark states in the light - quark sector . in this sense",
    "we may be on the verge of opening up a new frontier of hadron spectroscopy in the 1.5 to 2.5 gev mass region of the meson sector where the vast majority of the complications seem to occur ; many @xmath5 states remain to be discovered .",
    "it is important to find them and then to pin down the details of the @xmath5 spectrum to pave the ground for the search for exotic states .",
    "most of the significant deviations from the quark model occur in the light - quark isoscalar sector .",
    "much of the current excitement is with the scalar mesons .",
    "even if we relegate the @xmath101 ( along with the isovector @xmath100 ) to multiquark status , we still have to contend with the @xmath132 and the @xmath133 ( if indeed @xmath134 ) .",
    "it is quite possible that these two states are mixtures of the ground state glueball and the @xmath84 scalar meson , but this will have to wait for better experiments and clearer phenomenology to establish a consistent pattern .    the long outstanding @xmath135 problem remains with us .",
    "the evidence clearly points to two separate states each for @xmath136 and @xmath137 , where exactly one of each are expected based on @xmath5 degrees of freedom .",
    "ascribing hybrid , glueball , or multiquark status to the extra states is problematic , though , because no clear picture emerges from the current set of experimental data .",
    "new high statistics measurements of @xmath138 and @xmath139 production may be very helpful .",
    "certainly a better phenomenological understanding of reactions near the @xmath140 threshold is crucial for progress here .    despite its long history ,",
    "the @xmath141 is still enigmatic .",
    "it may or may not be a peculiar , narrow meson representing the @xmath142 glueball , and it may or not have an underlying broad structure which is a manifestation of @xmath142 or @xmath143 strangeonium .",
    "we also continue to deal with a possible overpopulation of @xmath142 states , in particular the various @xmath144 states observed in @xmath145 decay .    finally , there are exotic mesons which necessarily imply a meson state beyond @xmath5 models .",
    "evidence is finally beginning to sort itself out in the @xmath146 channel , and does now seem to point towards an exotic @xmath94 state near 1380  mev/@xmath147 .",
    "it is difficult to accomodate this , however , in present models of excited gluonic degrees of freedom .",
    "some evidence is now emerging for higher mass exotic states , but more data will be necessary , particularly in reactions which are expected to _ enhance _ the production rate . a good candidate laboratory is peripheral photoproduction , and new facilities are on the horizon .",
    "hadron spectroscopy is undergoing a renaissance , taking place at many facilities worldwide .",
    "we anxiously look forward to new results .",
