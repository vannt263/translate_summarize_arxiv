    ", biological tissues are constantly renewed by newly born cells from stem cell pools .",
    "the production of cells must be balanced with the death of old cells , which is called tissue homeostasis .",
    "tissue stem cells , which are able to proliferate ( i.e. , divide ) and differentiate into tissue specific cells , play a key role in tissue turnover . since differentiated cells exit from the proliferation cycle and are eventually killed , tissue homeostasis is maintained by balanced kinetics of stem cell fate ( proliferation or differentiation ) .",
    "intercellular interactions in cell fate decision kinetics are considered to be crucial during homeostasis , and therefore , nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of many - body systems  @xcite is expected to play an important role to clarify the mechanism of tissue homeostasis .",
    "recent advances in experiments have enabled the tracing of cell fate dynamics ( i.e. , kinetics of proliferation and differentiation ) in adult mammalian tissues  @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "cells in the tissue are labeled by fluorescent proteins , which are inherited to their progeny .",
    "starting from isolated labeled single cells in the basal layer tissue , the cells can divide and expand its population within the basal layer , or get excluded from the basal layer through differentiation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : clonal analysis](a ) ) .",
    "the measured population of the labeled cells that survived in the basal layer ( i.e. , clone ) showed scaling behavior in statistics .",
    "most significantly , the average number of cells in surviving clones showed power - law growth @xmath0 , and the cumulative clone size distribution @xmath1 ( i.e. , the probability of having a clone with no less than @xmath2 cells ) showed the scaling law @xmath3 , which both depended on the spatial dimension of the tissue  @xcite .",
    "the scaling behavior ruled out one of the classical pictures of tissue homeostasis , where stem cells always undergo asymmetric division ( one daughter cell is differentiating and the other maintains its stemness ) .",
    "the quantitative modeling approach has revealed two canonical examples of stochastic dynamics that explain the scaling behaviors .",
    "importantly , these two models reflect the different mechanisms of cell fate regulation  @xcite .",
    "firstly , cell - extrinsic regulation results in the scaling form with @xmath4 and @xmath5 in one - dimension  @xcite , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 in two - dimension  @xcite .",
    "these scaling forms are derived from the voter model ( vm )  @xcite , in which a differentiating cell leaving the basal layer is assumed to directly trigger the proliferation of a neighboring cell to compensate for the loss ( the mechanism can be vice versa , fig .  [",

    "the second scheme is the cell - intrinsic regulation  @xcite , which is described by the critical birth - death process ( cbd )  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : clonal analysis](c ) ) .",
    "this model assumes that a cell stochastically chooses proliferation or differentiation with equal probability independent from other cells , which results in the scaling form with @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite . the extrinsic model ( i.e. , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) was consistent with clonal labeling experiments in some one - dimensional tissues such as intestinal crypts  @xcite and seminiferous tubules  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the experimental works in skin tissues ( i.e. , two - dimensional tissues ) @xcite showed that both cell - intrinsic and extrinsic models are consistent with the clonal dynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a model of cell fate decision , focusing on the cell - cell interaction associated with a finite range . in our model , the population of cells is regarded as a self - replicating many - body langevin system , where we incorporate intercellular interaction in the self - replication process through local cell density  @xcite , where density is defined with a certain length scale .",
    "both short- and long - range interaction can be realized in real tissues as consequences of different regulatory mechanisms .",
    "for example , recent experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite works suggest that mechanical cues could be relevant in cell fate decision .",
    "long - range interaction via autocrine signaling is also crucial in skin stem cells  @xcite .",
    "therefore , exploring cell fate decision processes from the point of view of cell - cell interaction range would be significant .",
    "we find that homeostasis is maintained in this model as a consequence of the interaction , meaning that global cell density is autonomously kept constant on average .",
    "furthermore , we show that the previously proposed vm and cbd scenarios are incorporated in our model as the small and large limits of the cell - cell interaction range .",
    "this indicates that the interaction range of the density - dependent replication process is a key in determining which model of the two appears in biological tissues .",
    "we find that in the case of the intermediate value of the interaction range , the clone size statistics cross over from the cbd statistics to the vm statistics as time evolves .",
    "we propose that by evaluating the timing of the crossover in experiment , we can indirectly infer the interaction range of the fate decision dynamics in the tissue .",

    "the total system is divided into a chain of boxes with width @xmath28 , which is the cluster size of cells that essentially feel the same cell density according to eq .  .",
    "now we focus on the two boxes at the boundary between labeled and unlabeled population .",
    "since the clonal dynamics within each box approximately follows the cbd dynamics , the average time in which all the unlabeled cells in a box are replaced by the labeled cells in the neighboring box ( or vice versa ) is approximately @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , by scaling @xmath10 by @xmath71 and @xmath31 by @xmath28 , the clonal dynamics in terms of the coarse - grained local cell density would be similar to that in the small @xmath28 limit , and thus the vm statistics appear in the long time scale . scaling collapse in fig .",

    "since the crossover appears after the average clone size @xmath65 reaches the interaction range @xmath28 , the system size needs to be large enough compared with @xmath28 in order to detect the crossover in finite size tissues .",
    "our crossover detection scheme would be applicable to one - dimensional systems such as seminiferous tubules .",

    "thus , by examining the statistics of smaller clones at shorter time scale , it may be possible to detect the crossover before the clonal dynamics converging to the vm statistics , allowing us to estimate the finite interaction range .",

    "the clone size statistics cross over from that of cbd to that of vm in the course of time .",
    "furthermore , we studied the scaling hypothesis for the dynamical crossover of the average clone size .",
    "the one - dimensional tissue experiments revealed the vm statistics without its detailed mechanism , and our study clarified a natural scenario behind the emergence of the vm statistics in biological systems .",
    "although the mechanism of tissue homeostasis has not yet been revealed at the level of molecular biology , our phenomenological analysis has quantitatively elucidated the role of the time and length scales of cell - cell interactions .",
    "the density dependent mechanism of cell fate regulation could arise via either mechanical cues from surrounding cells , external cues from the niche , or long - range autocrine signaling . extracting the length scale from the crossover",
    "would possibly be a key to investigate the nature of regulation in cell fate decision .",
    "we expect that our analysis would provide a platform for further studies .",

    "<S> we study the asymptotic behaviors of stochastic cell fate decision between proliferation and differentiation . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a model of a self - replicating langevin system , where cells choose their fate ( i.e. proliferation or differentiation ) depending on local cell density . </S>",
    "<S> based on this model , we propose a scenario for multi - cellular organisms to maintain the density of cells ( i.e. , homeostasis ) through finite - ranged cell - cell interactions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we numerically show that the distribution of the number of descendant cells changes over time , thus unifying the previously proposed two models regarding homeostasis : the critical birth death process and the voter model . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a general platform for the study of stochastic cell fate decision in terms of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .    </S>",
