    "thermal analyses of hadronic yields in heavy - ion collisions @xcite have become a popular tool for the interpretation of the data collected at the ags @xcite , sps @xcite , and rhic energies @xcite .",
    "most often , the successful results of such analyses are understood as the evidence for high - level thermalization of the hadronic systems produced in such collisions .",
    "if the single - freeze - out scenario is assumed @xcite , in addition to the hadron yields , the thermal approach may be used to describe other physical observables . in particular , it has been successfully used to reproduce the rhic transverse momentum spectra @xcite , collective flow @xcite , femtoscopic observables @xcite , and charge balance functions @xcite .    in the thermal approach ,",
    "one usually obtains very good fits with just a few thermodynamic parameters , such as the temperature , @xmath0 , the baryon and strangeness chemical potentials , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , or in the extended approaches the quark fugacities , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and additional parameters describing the system s geometry and expansion ( flow ) .",
    "recently , the single - freeze - out model has been applied to the lhc data describing transverse - momentum spectra of hadrons produced in pb+pb collisions at the beam energy @xmath5  2.76 tev @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the model reproduces well the spectra of pions , kaons , and hyperons , however , it does not reproduce the proton spectra .",
    "this results agrees with an earlier finding that the ratios of all hadron abundances measured at the lhc , except for protons , may be described within the thermal model @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that the agreement of the thermal models with the data does not necessarily imply the fact that the system is locally equilibrated .",
    "we take into account possible differences in the local distribution of _ transverse _ and _ longitudinal _ momenta ( with the directions defined with respect to the beam axis ) . using the covariant romatschke - strickland form ( rsf ) for the anisotropic phase - space momentum distributions ,",
    "we show that i )  the ratios of hadron multiplicities are exactly the same as in the locally equilibrated system , if the temperature @xmath0 is identified with a characteristic transverse - momentum scale @xmath6 , ii )  the transverse - momentum spectra of hadrons are changed , to a very good approximation , only by an overall factor which depends on the momentum anisotropy parameter appearing in rfs  since this change may be easily compensated by a change of the parameters defining the size of the system , the transverse - momentum spectra may be also treated as insensitive to the discussed momentum anisotropy , finally , iii )  the discussed invariance of the spectra may be used to improve the model hbt results for pions",
    ".    generally speaking , our results demonstrate robustness of the thermal framework against specific variations of the model assumptions .",
    "this and other similar studies ( see , for example , @xcite ) show that the thermal approach is quite successful even in the situations where matter is out of equilibrium .",
    "our results concerning the ratios of hadronic abundances agree qualitatively with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , where an approximate invariance of the ratios has been demonstrated with slightly different physical assumptions .",
    "we stress that we consider the anisotropy between longitudinal and transverse momenta considered in the local rest frame of the fluid element .",
    "these two directions are defined always with respect to the beam axis .",
    "we do not consider the anisotropy of the transverse - momentum distributions in the @xmath7 plane , quantified by the harmonic flow coefficients @xmath8 .",
    "for simplicity , in the discussion of the spectra we consider boost - invariant and cylindrically symmetric models that have been implemented in the monte - carlo generator therminator @xcite .",
    "we compare the results of the model calculations with the lhc data for pb+pb collisions at the beam energy @xmath9  tev .",
    "in this paper we assume that primordial hadrons are emitted from the freeze - out hypersurface @xmath10 and their spectra may be calculated with the help of the cooper - frye formula @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the particle s energy , @xmath13 is the element of the freeze - out hypersurface , and @xmath14 is the phase - space distribution function of the emitted particles . for systems in local thermal equilibrium one",

    "typically , the freeze - out conditions are defined by the fixed values of @xmath0 and @xmath19 , hence these two quantities may be treated as constants in ( [ feq ] ) .",
    "the equilibrium distributions depend on the scalar product of the particle four - momentum @xmath20 and the four - velocity @xmath21 of the fluid element .",
    "we use the standard parameterizations @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 .    in order to study the effects of the anisotropic distributions , we modify eq .",

    "the calculation of the density @xmath41 may be done in the lrf and the result is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the particle density in equilibrium at the temperature defined by the parameter @xmath6 .    using eq .",
    "( [ ni2 ] ) in ( [ cfn ] ) we find @xmath44 and for the ratios @xmath45    we thus see that the ratios of hadronic multiplicities are exactly the same as the ratios obtained for equilibrium distributions at the temperature @xmath6 .",
    "we also note that for the boost - invariant systems we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the rapidity range .",
    "hence , in this case , the ratios of rapidity densities are the same as the ratios obtained for equilibrium at the temperature @xmath6 .",
    "in this section we calculate the transverse - momentum spectra in the thermal model with single freeze - out and compare our results with the lhc data .",
    "we use therminator 2 @xcite and choose two options for the shape of the freeze - out hypersurface : i ) the cracow model , and ii ) the blast - wave model .",
    "these two models have been recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "we follow closely the method presented in @xcite .",
    "the main difference is the use of the modified distributions at freeze - out .      in the cracow model",
    "the freeze - out hypersurface is defined by the condition that the invariant time is fixed . the value of this time , @xmath48 , and the transverse size of the system , @xmath49 , are the two geometric parameters of the model .",
    "the flow of matter at freeze - out has the hubble form @xmath50 .",
    "if the hadronic system is in equilibrium , the freeze - out conditions are defined by the two extra parameters : the freeze - out temperature , @xmath0 , and the freeze - out baryon chemical potential , @xmath19 . in this work",
    "we neglect the chemical potential and introduce the scale parameter @xmath6 instead of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the hadron distributions are taken as rsf with the anisotropy parameter @xmath26 , which we keep constant in this section .",
    "thus , altogether we have four independent parameters : @xmath51 and @xmath26 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we analyzed pb+pb collisions at the beam energy @xmath9  tev for three centrality classes .",
    "we used three parameters : @xmath52 and @xmath0 .",
    "the freeze - out temperature was always set equal to @xmath53  mev , while the geometric parameters depended on the centrality class , we used : @xmath54  fm and @xmath55  fm for @xmath56  0%5% , @xmath57  fm and @xmath58  fm for @xmath56  10%20% , and finally @xmath59  fm and @xmath60  fm for @xmath56  30%40% .",
    "we have added the superscript @xmath61 to mark that the above values have been used in the equilibrium calculations .",

    "( [ ni2 ] ) . using the same rescaling for @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "we find that the transverse flow profiles change very moderately ( within 20% ) .",
    "hence , the invariance of our results for the spectra with respect to the transformation ( [ cracow - par ] ) is only approximate .",
    "this property is explained in more detail in the appendix .      in this section",

    "the main outcome of these calculations is that the radii are reproduced best in the blast - wave model with @xmath77 .",
    "we recall that the freeze - out conditions described by a negative value of @xmath69 correspond to the situation where the outer parts of the system freeze out earlier than the system s interior .",

    "the radius @xmath76 is practically independent of the anisotropy parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the latter behavior may be understood as a net result of the two effects : a decrease of the longitudinal homogeneity length due to the decreased longitudinal pressure and an increase of this length due to the overall increase of the size of the system .",

    "in this paper we have considered locally anisotropic momentum distributions of hadrons at freeze - out in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we have taken into account the local anisotropy between the longitudinal and transverse momenta .",
    "our results show that physical observables , such as the ratios of hadron abundances or the hadronic transverse - momentum spectra , are in practice indistinguishable from those obtained in an analogous equilibrium calculations  the effect of the momentum anisotropy may be compensated by an appropriate change of the geometric models of the system .",
    "we have also demonstrated that this freedom of the parameters may be used to improve the agreement of the model calculations with the measured hbt radii .",
    "our results indicate insensitivity of the thermal approach against specific variations of the model assumptions and show that it may be quite successful even in the situations where matter is out of equilibrium .",
