    "the concept of casimir forces,@xcite i.e. long - ranged effective interactions between macroscopic bodies immersed in strongly fluctuating media , is nowadays recognized in plethora of systems ranging from biology to cosmology .",
    "on one hand their prominent importance stems from providing possibilities of testing theories of fundamental interactions,@xcite on the other they are invoked to explain important mechanisms underlying physical phenomena in organic matter@xcite and as a control tool for nanodevices.@xcite the more conventional and well - studied ( also experimentally ) examples of casimir forces in condensed matter include fluid mixtures@xcite and helium.@xcite    the essence of the phenomenology underlying the casimir forces is the presence of soft fluctuations occurring within a medium , whose spectrum of excitations becomes constrained by the boundary conditions imposed by the confining walls or by macroscopic objects immersed therein . as a result ,",
    "the free energy acquires a contribution depending on the separation @xmath7 between the walls ( or the objects ) and the system finds it favorable to either increase or decrease this distance .",
    "a prominent characteristic of casimir forces is the universality of its asymptotic behavior ( including the amplitude ) for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a system - specific microscopic lengthscale and @xmath11 denotes the ( bulk ) correlation length for the medium fluctuations .",
    "if the system features spontaneously broken continuous symmetry , one should additionally distinguish the transverse and longitudinal bulk correlation lengths .",
    "the system then displays a crossover between the goldstone and critical regimes upon varying temperature .",
    "for a recent study of this crossover see ref .  .",
    "on the other hand , the amplitude of the force ( even its sign ) does depend on the boundary conditions .",
    "the orthodox qed casimir force@xcite is a pure effect of quantum vacuum fluctuations .",
    "its theoretical description involves a free field theory , where interactions with matter are taken into account via boundary conditions and the expectation value of the fluctuating electromagnetic field is zero .",
    "the situation is quite distinct in these respects in many condensed matter systems . here",
    "a field - theoretic description of the problem often requires a treatment of interaction terms in the effective action . for certain cases",
    ", the boundary terms may also lead to nonzero expectation values of the ( nonuniform ) order parameter , which gives rise to effective interactions between the confining walls ( or other macroscopic objects ) also in the absence of fluctuations .    in this work",
    "we analyze the critical casimir effect employing a class of standard models to describe different aspects of critical behavior , namely the @xmath1-dimensional @xmath0-symmetric @xmath12-type models .",
    "the system is confined to be finite in one direction ( so that its extension is @xmath7 ) and we consider the periodic boundary conditions . despite not being of the highest relevance for quantitative comparison with experimental data , this choice of boundary conditions does not yield casimir forces at mean - field level , so that the effective interaction is a pure fluctuation effect ( preserving the analogy to the qed setup ) .",
    "in addition , these boundary conditions yield a zero - mode in the free propagator , which leads to substantial complications in a conventional rg treatment , where the @xmath13-expansion@xcite becomes ill - defined beyond two - loop order.@xcite we study the system within the one - particle - irreducible ( wetterich ) framework of functional rg.@xcite the exact flow equation governing the flow of the generating functional for irreducible vertices is treated within an approximation retaining the flow of interaction couplings of arbitrary order , but neglecting the renormalization of the momentum dependencies in the propagators .",
    "this amounts to the leading order of an approximation strategy known as derivative expansion,@xcite which was successfully applied _",

    "the quality of the results for bulk critical exponents in @xmath6 is comparable to @xmath13 - expansion at second order , but the present approach performs much better than perturbative rg for @xmath4 .",

    "the system preserves translational symmetry and the casimir forces arise solely due to fluctuations .",
    "these are long - ranged and universal at criticality .",
    "our approach relies on a truncation of the one - particle - irreducible variant of functional rg at leading order in the so - called derivative expansion .",
    "we believe this approach complements the mc calculations in that the directly accessible system sizes are by far larger . on the other hand",
    ", it does not suffer from complications occurring in perturbative rg treatments and related to nonanalyticities in the @xmath13-expansion , revealed beyond two loops .",
    "it is also applicable both in @xmath1 close to 2 and 3 , and we scanned a range of @xmath1-values in our calculations .",
    "our results agree with the expectation that the critical casimir force decays with the separation @xmath7 between the walls as @xmath111 and the thermal energy @xmath129 sets the relevant scale .",
    "we have computed the critical casimir force amplitudes @xmath2 for the ising ( @xmath5 ) and xy ( @xmath16 ) universality classes varying dimensionality between 2 and 3 and remaining in the symmetric phase , but very close to the critical point .",
    "our findings in @xmath4 compare well to the exact results . in @xmath6",
    "the computed casimir amplitudes reasonably agree with numerical simulations , they are also significantly closer to mc than the earlier field - theoretic rg calculations .",
    "the level of agreement ( in particular in @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) suggests that the details of the momentum dependencies of the correlation function are not relevant for the magnitude of the casimir forces at criticality .",
    "this may seem somewhat surprising , considering that the presently studied effect arises exclusively due to critical fluctuations .",
    "indeed , our calculation neglects the nonzero anomalous dimension @xmath99 whatsoever and also gives incorrect values of the correlation length exponent @xmath94 in @xmath4 .",
    "still , the results agree well with the exact findings in @xmath4 .",
    "this result suggests considering the casimir amplitudes among the critical properties which are insensitive to the presence of anomalous propagator scaling ( nonzero @xmath99 ) quite alike , for example , the power laws describing the casimir forces decay or the universal shapes of the transition lines in quantum - critical systems .    to verify this",
    ", we performed an additional calculation in @xmath4 , @xmath5 capturing the anomalous dimension .",
    "althought this refinement leads to a much better resolution of the bulk critical behavior , it has practically no impact on our results referring to the casimir forces .    from a principal point of view",
    ", the present approach is applicable for all the @xmath0 models at arbitrary dimensionality @xmath1 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "one exception is the kosterlitz - thouless case , which requires going to higher order in derivative expansion . in practice",
    "however , the computation of the casimir forces requires increasing numerical accuracy with growing @xmath1 , and may become problematic already at @xmath188 .",
    "another interesting regime is @xmath189 , where one may again compare to exact results",
    ".    it might be interesting to extend the present work to account for boundary conditions explicitly breaking translational symmetry .",
    "this problem is of interest also from the point of view of comparison to experiments performed on helium and fluid mixtures .",
    "the other interesting extensions which should be within the range of the present approach include computations within the ordered phase , where the soft fluctuations arise due to continuous symmetry breaking , and extracting the scaling functions for the casimir force .",
