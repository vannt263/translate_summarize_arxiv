    "the four fundamental interactions in physics are described by two different disciplines .",
    "the gravitational interaction follows the curved spacetime approach of the general theory of relativity laid down by einstein in which the dynamical variable is the metric tensor , while the electroweak and strong interactions follow the local gauge vector boson approach pioneered by yang and mills in which the dynamical variables are the vector bosons .",
    "both disciplines give spectacular success in terms of experiments and physical observations , despite of the fact that they look very different .",
    "there are , by now , many research works done in trying to put these two disciplines into one single footing .",
    "some people try to visualize gauge vector boson interactions as geometrical manifestations in a higher dimensional manifold with our spacetime as a four dimensional sub - manifold  @xcite .",
    "other people try to consider the geometrical gravitation theory in the form of a local gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "all of these ideas are met with difficulties in one way or the other .    and in the past decades many new discoveries in astronomy",
    "might imply that the general theory of relativity is not sophisticated enough to explain the new phenomena .",
    "for example , stellar objects at the spiral arms of galaxies are orbiting at faster speeds than that can be explained by the keplerian motions . to overcome this difficulty , people assume that some extra matter , not visible to us , is giving an extra pull on these stellar objects .",
    "extra light deflections , as observed in the intergalactic gravitational lensing , are also ascribed to the existence of this extra matter .",
    "this is known as the @xmath1 @xmath2 problem .",
    "an equally well known fact is that the universe is accelerating in its expansion .",
    "this is in contrast to our expectation that the universe should be decelerating , unless some extra energy is kept pumping into the universe .",
    "this is the so called the @xmath1 @xmath3 problem    in this article , we shall give a new approach to use the yang - mills method to construct a local gauge theory of gravity , and shall show that this theory can successfully solve the @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath1 @xmath3 problems .",
    "here we shall consider the local gauge theory approach of gravitation , albeit in a new context .",
    "a non - minkowskian world metric for our spacetime is always regarded as what makes it curved .",
    "however , it is very difficult to regard the world metric ( or more precisely its corresponding vierbein fields ) as gauge fields because of the peculiar way it appears in the action that determines physics .    in the following",
    "we shall assign the world metric of our spacetime with a much limited role .",
    "we shall assume that the only function of the world metric @xmath4 is to give us world distance ( and hence world volume element @xmath5 ) , and will have no dynamical terms ( terms that contain spatial or temporal derivatives of @xmath4 ) in the action .",
    "this assumption frees us from taking the global minkowskian metric as the de facto world metric and sets the notion that no particular metric is a priori world metric for physics . in this sense ,",
    "the world metric for our spacetime serves just as an arbitrary background of measuring clock and stick in our discussion of physics .    with a given world metric @xmath6 at the point @xmath7 with world coordinates @xmath8 , a set of vierbein fields @xmath9 will follow .",
    "these vierbein fields are defined in a locally flat patch that is assumed to be equipped with an arbitrary but given local minkowskian frame whose coordinates and metric are @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the differentials of these two coordinate systems define the vierbein fields as @xmath12 , and hence the world metric and the vierbein fields will then be related by @xmath13 here , and in the following , the latin indices will signify the minkowskian components while the greek indices will mean the world ones .",
    "on a locally flat patch around a point of our spacetime is where we do our physics .",
    "even though we have already had a local minkowskian system @xmath10 and @xmath11 on that patch , we may still have the freedom to re - label the points on that patch with different local coordinate systems , for example , by rotating and stretching these local minkowskian coordinate axes .",
    "these rotations and stretches are reflections of the relative physical situations experienced by local observers . for examples , a relative rotation of two local minkowskian frames",
    "is always regared as a relative lorentzian motion between the two local observers .",
    "the form of the admissible local coordinate transformations depends on what are the physical principles that , we hope , to remain invariant under these coordinate changes .    here , we believe that the law of inertia should remain intact under these expected coordinate transformations .",
    "this means that the concept of straight lines should be preserved , as an object moving in straight line in one coordinate system should remain moving in straight line in another coordinate system .",
    "also light should propagate in straight lines in whatever coordinate system we are using .",
    "causality is also a very important concept in physics , and hence the order of points and the ratio of segment lengths in a straight line should not change with a change in coordinate system . and of course , the concept of parallelness should also be preserved because two parallel moving objects , as well as parallel light rays , should remain parallel under a change of coordinate system .",
    "those transformations which maintain collinearity , order of points and invariant segment ratios in straight lines , and parallelness are , in fact , the affine transformations of euler  @xcite .",
    "affine transformations are sometimes grouped together as dilations , rotations , shears and reflections .",
    "we shall call collectively transformations that are not rotations as strains .",
    "here we want to emphasize that our choice of the affine transformations as our admissible local coordinate transformations comes from physics .",
    "it comes from our belief that these admissible transformations should leave the above said physical principles invariant . and",
    "if we are going to call such a chosen local coordinate system as a chosen local geometric setting , then we can say that physics is assumed to be invariant under a change of local geometric setting . in physical language , what his means , is that physics looks the same to all observers having the proposed relative physical situations . and this can be regarded as an extension of the principle of relativity of the special theory of relativity to a general spacetime manifold .",
    "these transformations form a lie group , called the local affine group .",
    "it was felix klein who first suggested of classifying geometries by their underlying symmetry groups , starting with the projective geometry ( our affine geometry is a restriction of the projective geometry ) .",
    "such a mathematical program is called the erlangen program  @xcite .",
    "since matter , which are world objects , are described by local fields with the reference to a local coordinate system .",
    "these local fields could have structures that depend on the geometric setting chosen at that point .",
    "for example , if we want to describe the physics of an electron , it may be convenient to choose the local affine rotations as our local lorentz transformations .",
    "then an affine rotated setting will give a set of lorentz transformed fields .",
    "as we believe that the relative differences of the local fields of the same world object at two space - time points arising from different geometric settings are physically meaningless , we have to find some way to counteract such variations .",
    "similar to what have been done by yang and mills  @xcite , we shall introduce a set of vector bosons to do these counteractions .",
    "note that the introduction of vector bosons , as suggested by yang and mills , were originally used to facilitate the local identifications of internal quantum numbers for quantum systems .",
    "here we extend their ideas to the local identifications of geometric settings in our spacetime .    at any point of our spacetime",
    ", these vector bosons can be transformed away locally by a suitable choice of the coordinate system at that point . a more familiar way of saying this is that these vector fields are locally equivalent to a transformation of the coordinate system .",
    "one can then draw the strong analogy between the above statement and the principle of equivalence of einstein which states that `` there is a complete physical equivalence of a gravitational field and a corresponding acceleration of the reference system '' .",
    "the principle of equivalence is the founding principle taken by einstein to build his general theory of relativity , and the gauge principle stated in the above will be shown , as given below , to give a theory of vector gravity .    in the following ,",
    "these vector boson fields are regarded as dynamical variables .",
    "their dynamics will be fabricated so as to ensure that physics be invariant under local affine transformations . and this will be done , again by following yang and mills , by first constructing the lagrangian that is locally affine symmetric .",
    "for a four dimensional patch , these affine transformations can be carried out by @xmath15 invertible real matrices , either actively or passively .",
    "all these @xmath15 invertible real matrices form a lie group called the real general linear group of dimension four and is designated as @xmath14 .",
    "hence the @xmath14 will be synonymous with our affine group .",
    "the @xmath14 has two sets of generators .",
    "the six anti - symmetric generators @xmath16 generate the rotations while the ten symmetric generators @xmath17 generate the strains .",
    "they satisfy the following commutation relations  @xcite @xmath18 & = & -i \\ { \\eta^{ac}j^{bd } - \\eta^{ad}j^{bc } - \\eta^{bc}j^{ad } + \\eta^{bd}j^{ac } \\ } ; \\nonumber \\\\        \\left[j^{ab } , t^{cd}\\right ] & = & -i \\ { \\eta^{ac}t^{bd } + \\eta^{ad}t^{bc } - \\eta^{bc}t^{ad } - \\eta^{bd}t^{ac } \\ } ;    \\\\",

    "[ eq : commu_gen ] has no presupposition of the existence of the minkowskian metric on the locally flat patch of our spacetime .",
    "we are introducing @xmath14 into physics in our way because we want to emphasize that there are some very fundamental laws , namely , the law of inertia and the law of causality , working together to impose the @xmath14 symmetry onto our spacetime .",
    "`` invariance dictates interaction '' , said c. n. yang .",
    "this doctrine seems working well in the electroweak and the strong interactions .",
    "we propose in this article that this doctrine could apply to gravity too .",

    "the generators of @xmath14 differs from the generators of @xmath28 by a dilatation part of @xmath36 , which is @xmath37 . in other words , @xmath38 ,",

    "of course , the total action will also contain a piece coming from the matter fields which are supposed to couple gauge invariantly to the gauge fields  @xcite , and thus making the total action @xmath44 as @xmath45",

    "[ eq : amp ] . and",
    "this can be done by looking at the extrema of the action .",
    "the role played by @xmath4 in classical physics would be clear if we were able to integrate out the @xmath14 gauge field and then solve for the equation of motion containing only the metric .",

    "fortunately , we are able to show that the @xmath14 gauge theory is identical to a geometric theory quadratic in the riemannian tensor albeit that the metric and connections are now independent variables . and thanks to the works of many people , this geometric theory was shown to contain the schwarzschild metric and some other world metric as solutions . in the following",

    "from this first equation we shall select the world metrics for our classical world .    up to this point , we have not used any sophisticated concepts in geometry such as the connection , the parallelism and the curvature .",
    "the only thing we have used that may have something to do with geometry is that our spacetime should have a metric , telling us how to measure distance and volume .",
    "so the geometry of our spacetime is not riemannian , and is not even affine ; it is just metrical .    from our point of view",
    ", a metric is fundamental and is needed if we want to construct an action from some local fields .",
    "the concepts of connection , parallism and curvature are , however , not fundamental . if we can show that the schwarzschild metric and some other metric can follow from our eq .",
    "[ eq : var_action ] , then we can claim that the description of gravity needs no sophisticated geometric ideas other than that of a metric .",
    "before we embark on further discussions , we should clarify the role played by our dimensionless parameter @xmath43 and should also clarify the way how the newtonian gravitational constant @xmath54 makes its appearance in gravitation phenomena .",
    "@xmath43 appears because there is an arbitrariness in fixing the relative scale between the matter and gauge parts of the lagrangian .",
    "the value of @xmath43 should have no significance in physics , and can be absorbed into the definition of the matter field .",
    "what have significance on physics are the integration constants that accompany the solutions to the equation of motion .",
    "because @xmath6 is dimensionless , @xmath7 must be scaled by some integration constant @xmath55 which has the dimension of length .",

    "the fact that @xmath55 is proportional to the inertial mass @xmath56 of the gravitational source , @xmath57 , is inferred by comparing the weak field limit of the solution with the newtonian gravitational potential .",

    "one way that could help us in solving eq .",
    "[ eq : var_action ] is to cast this equation into a form that we are acquainted with . from the yang - mills fields @xmath53 and the vierbein fields @xmath58 we can construct some new fields called the @xmath59 fields by  @xcite @xmath60 and then substitute the sixty - four variables @xmath22 by the new sixty - four variables @xmath61 , by plugging @xmath22 into @xmath62 in eq .",
    "[ eq : f_munu ] .",

    "[ eq : tot_act_var ] is in fact a combined result of the first equation and the second equation of eq .",
    "[ eq : var_action ] , because the action can depend on @xmath4 through its dependence on @xmath53 when @xmath61 is held fixed .",
    "one interesting thing that is worth noting is that if we are going to integrate over all the distinctive @xmath61 ( apart from a diffeomorphism of the entire spacetime ) , we are in fact factoring out the group volume of @xmath14 as was shown explicitly in eq .",

    "now eq .  [ eq : ym_pot_new ] looks like the famous geometric relation between the affine connections and the spin connections under the tetrad postulate , if we regard @xmath61 as the affine connections and @xmath53 as the spin connections . and",
    ".  [ eq : ym_action_new ] , eq .  [ eq : ym_act_var ] and eq .  [ eq : tot_act_var ] , together , look like a geometric theory with a geometric lagrangian and a set of geometric equations of motion that we have encountered frequently in talking about gravity .",
    "hence it is natural for us to put all these in the following geometric jargons : that a parallel connection @xmath61 is introduced into the spacetime , that a riemann curvature tensor is constructed , that a gravitational lagrangian is formed out of the product of the riemannian curvature tensor , that we are trying to obtain the gravity equations by varying the connections and the metric independently @xmath0la palatini  @xcite , and that gravity is a kind of metric - affine theory  @xcite . from the above discussions , it is now clear that what all these things that were done in the past , were done in pieces by following the doctrines laid down by klein , einstein , yang and mills and feynman , either knowingly or unknowingly .",
    "this form of the gravitational action of eq .",
    "[ eq : ym_action_new ] has presented itself many times in the history of the development of the geometric theory of gravity , but is , in fact , carrying very different information at each one of the presentations .",
    "the point of focus is on the relation between the metric and the connections .    in its very early version , as proposed by hermann weyl  @xcite ,",
    "the connections that appear in the theory are nothing but the christoffel symbols which are of first derivatives in the metric .",
    "this will result into a theory in which the metric is the only dynamical variable , and the variation with respect to the metric will give an equation of motion of higher order derivatives .",
    "it is well known that such a theory will possess runaway solutions .",
    "later yang  @xcite , also regarded the connections as the christoffel symbols at the start , but varied the connections instead in order to get the equation of motion .",
    "the final result is , again , an equation of higher derivatives in the metric .",
    "stephenson  @xcite , put the anti - symmetric parts of the connections equal to zero , and regarded the symmetric parts of the connections and the metric as independent variables .",
    "and he obtained two equations of motion by varying both the metric and symmetric parts of the connections independently .",
    "on the other hand , some people identify the symmetric parts of the connections as the christoffel symbols and regard the anti - symmetric parts and the metric as independent variables .",

    "the different choices of the content coded in the riemann curvature tensor give different stories for physics .",
    "for example , for the weyl theory ,",
    "the metric is the only dynamical variable , and hence the action will contain kinetic terms that have derivatives that are of orders higher than two . and",
    "when we look for the possible propagation modes in the theory , which can be obtained by looking at the inverse of the kinetic term , we will find that there will be propagators having the wrong signs , which will correspond to unphysical states called the ghosts or tachyons , and will end up into an unstable theory with the so called ostrogradski instability  @xcite .    for us ,",
    "the metric is a non - dynamical background field  @xcite , and the only dynamical variables are the connections which obey an equation second order in space and time derivatives .",

    "but we want to emphasize that they are appearing here in very different contexts .",
    "for example , we do not regard the world metric in our theory as a fundamental variable . instead , the world metric is just an arbitrary background of measuring clock and stick for our spacetime . the observed metric takes a particular form ( for example the schwarzschild metric ) simply because the affine gauge bosons require that particular metric in order to exist as a solution . as a result , we will not have spin-2 gravitons in our theory ; the 16 spin-1 vector bosons are the only propagating particles for gravitation . and the dynamics of gravity is fully governed by the @xmath14 yang - mills equation of motion .",
    "our theory is therefore a theory of vector gravity",
    ".    it might be interesting to point out that there had been many works done in the direction called the gauge theories of gravity .",
    "yet most of them are not gauge theories in the sense of yang and mills .",
    "people are either reluctant to give up the metric ( or the vierbein ) as gauge potential because they might think that the metric is too important for gravity theory to be put in an auxiliary position . or they might be afraid to take up the gravitational lagrangian that is quadratic in the field strength tensor as yang and mills did , because of the fear that there could be spurious solutions that will upset the known gravitational observations  @xcite .",
    "but an important factor that is preventing people to arrive earlier at a true gauge theory of gravitation based on @xmath14 , as we believe , is the wrong perception that the particle contents of the theory will not fit into experiments .",
    "it is one of our observations , as we have explained in the above , that our observed gravitational world is , in fact , a classical solution to the affine symmetric theory and is in a state of spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "the remaining symmetry is the local lorentz symmetry .    finally , a gravity theory with the lorentz group ( which is a subgroup of @xmath14 ) as the local gauge group can be obtained from our theory by simply restricting ourselves to the anti - symmetric components of the @xmath22",
    ". only the generators @xmath16 and the first commutation relation of eq .",
    "[ eq : commu_rel ] will be used .",
    "and we shall have a yang - mills gauge theory of 6 gauge vector bosons .",
    "all the results given in this article will then remain valid , with the exceptions that the local lorentz symmetry will now be honored by both the lagrangian and the solutions to the equations of motion , and that the metric and the connections will now be compatible automatically .",
    "one price has to be paid , though , by gauging the lorentz group instead of the @xmath14 .",
    "the riemannian tensor will then contain terms which are of second derivatives in the metric , and the metric and the torsion ( which are functions of the vierbeins and the gauge potentials ) are independent variables . and gravity theories basing on lagrangians quadratic in the riemannian tensor may have to face the affections by many of the pathologies of higher derivative theories . from the solutions of the equation of motion , it seems that gauging the lorentz group is good enough to describe the present day physical phenomena of gravity .",
    "apart from staying away from the pathologies that we have just mentioned by gauging the lorentz group , we are venturing into @xmath14 because we believe that there might be something in physics , in addition to gravity , that can be explained by the full affine symmetric gauge theory  @xcite .",

    "<S> we shall give dynamics to our spacetime manifold by first identifying the local affine symmetry as the characterizing symmetry for our geometry @xmath0la felix klein , this symmetry is imposed on us by the law of inertia and the law of causality . </S>",
    "<S> we then prescribe 16 gauge vector bosons to this symmetry @xmath0la yang and mills . the locally affine symmetric yang - mills lagrangian in the presence of a background world metric , and the corresponding equations of motion , are respectively constructed and derived . </S>",
    "<S> spontaneous breaking of the local affine symmetry to the local lorentz symmetry is achieved by classical solutions to the equations of motion . in these classical solutions , </S>",
    "<S> the 16 gauge vector bosons are shown to select the schwarzschild metric as one among the admissible background world metrics . </S>",
    "<S> classical gravity is thus be expressed by a spontaneously broken erlangen program . </S>",
    "<S> we shall also show that this yang - mills gauge theory of gravity can give an explanation of the form of the galactic rotation curves , of the amount of intergalactic gravitational lensing , and of the accelerating expansion of the universe . </S>"
