    "quantum state transfer ( qst ) , as the name suggests , refers to the transfer of an arbitrary quantum state from one qubit to another , which is a central task in quantum information science . for the solid - state based quantum computing at the large scale",
    ", it is very crucial to have a solid system serving as such quantum data bus , which can provide us with a quantum channel for quantum communication . during the last years",
    "many efforts have been made in different fields to design a feasible proposal for perfect qst .",
    "one kind of proper qst proposals is based on solid - state system with _ always - on _ interaction  @xcite .",
    "the communication is achieved by simply placing a quantum state at one end of the chain and waiting for an optimized time to let this state propagate to the other end with a high fidelity .",
    "the other kinds of proposals have paid much attention to adiabatic passage for coherent qst in time - evolving quantum systems , which is a powerful tool for manipulating a quantum system from an initial state to a target state .",
    "this way of population transfer has the important property of being robust against small variations of the hamiltonian and the transport time , which is crucial in experiment since the system parameters are often hard to control .",
    "the typical scheme for coherently spatial population transfer has been independently proposed for neutral atoms in optical traps  @xcite and for electrons in quantum dot ( qd ) systems  @xcite via a dark state of the system , which is termed coherent tunneling via adiabatic passage ( ctap ) following ref .",
    "in such a scheme , the tunneling interaction between adjacent quantum units is dynamically tuned by changing either the distance or the height of the neighboring potential wells following a counterintuitive scheme which is a solid - state analog of the well - known stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) protocol  @xcite of quantum optics . since then",
    ", the ctap technique has been proposed in a variety of physical systems for transporting single atoms  @xcite , spin states  @xcite , electrons  @xcite and bose - einstein condensates  bec1,bec2,bec3 .",
    "it has also been considered as a crucial element in the scale up to large quantum processors  @xcite .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite presented a scheme to adiabatically transfer an electron from the left end to the right end of a three dot chain using the ground state of the system .",
    "this technique is a copy of the frequency chirping method  @xcite , which is used in quantum optics to transfer the population of a three - level atom of the lambda configuration .",
    "the scheme  @xcite is presented as an alternative to a well known transfer scheme ( ctap )  @xcite . however , different from ctap process , the protocol in ref .",
    "@xcite considers a three qd array with _ always - on _ interaction which can be manipulated by the external gate voltage applied on the two external dots ( sender and receiver ) . through maintaining the system in the ground state",
    ", it shows that it is a high - fidelity process for a proper choice of system parameters and also robust against experimental parameter variations .",
    "the obvious extension of this work is to consider the passage through more than one intervening dot  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will consider a quasi - one - dimensional chain of qds , which is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "the central tight - binding chain serves as the quantum channel and two external qds are attached to the media chain .",
    "the sender ( alice ) and the receiver ( bob ) control one external qd each and alice transmits information via a qubit using the chain to bob by adiabatically changing the gate voltages .",
    "different from previously discussed schemes , we will consider a fixed @xmath0-site coupled qds media chain and qst can be realized in required transfer distance by modulating the positions where qd a and b are connected to the chain .",
    "in particular , the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitudes are set to be uniform .",
    "we first theoretically elaborate the adiabatic qst in this scheme . taking a 50-dot structure as an example ,",
    "we show that the electron can be robustly transported from alice to bob through the media chain , by slowly varying the gate voltages .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the model is setup and we describe the adiabatic transfer of an electron between qds . in sec .",
    "iii we show numerical results that substantiate the analytical results .",

    "we can still see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the optimum value of @xmath35 to achieve high - fidelity transfer decreases as the transfer distance increase which is consistent with the results shown before .",
    "in order to provide the most economical choice of parameters for reaching high transfer efficiency , we perform numerical analysis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . specifically , we depict the optimum coupling @xmath35 ( shown in fig .",

    "one can see that the time @xmath31 required for high - fidelity transfer scales linearly with transfer distance @xmath82 .",
    "an efficient qst scheme should not only admit a state transfer of any quantum state in a fixed period of time of the state evolution with high fidelity , but also the transfer time can not grow fast as communication distance increases . in this paper , we have introduced a long - range transport mechanism for quantum information around a quasi - one - dimensional qds network , based on adiabatic passage .",
    "this scheme is realized by modulation of gate voltages applied on the two external qds which is connected to the tight - binding chain . under suitable system parameters",
    ", the electron can be transported from the sender qd to the receiver one with high efficiency , carrying along with it the quantum information encoded in its spin .",
    "different from the ctapn scheme  @xcite , our method is to induce population transfer through tight - binding chain by maintaining the system in its ground state and this is more operable in experiments .",
    "we have studied the adiabatic qst through the system by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of the ground state evolution of tight - binding model .",
    "the result demonstrates that it is an efficient high - fidelity process ( 99.5% ) for an economical choice of system parameters .",
    "increasing the transfer distance , we found that the efficiency of qst is inversely proportional to the distance of the two qds .    in a real system , decoherence is the main obstacle to the experimental implementation of quantum information  @xcite .",
    "there are two sources of quantum decoherence in qds , one is due to charge dephasing brought by lead - qd coupling and the other is due to the hyperfine interaction . for the former ,",
    "the coherence time of quantum dot is @xmath1321 ns , which plays a role in this case . on the other hand , the maximum time in @xmath83 qd system needed for the appearance of the better fidelity",
    "is roughly proportional to @xmath133 . as a simple estimate of the effects of decoherence",
    ", we compare this time with the dephasing time , which leads to a limit of coupling strength of @xmath36 of @xmath13410 thz .",
    "the probability of realization of this idea in experiment can be maximized by more precise manipulation technology and by cooling the system .",
    "furthermore , the development of cold atom physics provides us with an alternative realization of our systems in experiment , because decoherence in cold - atom system is much less destructive .",
