    "a simplest generalization of nontopological solitons , initially proposed in @xcite and known as q - balls @xcite , from the global @xmath0 symmetry to the gauge @xmath0 symmetry was proposed and analyzed in the pioneering paper @xcite .",
    "later this subject was examined in the well - known paper @xcite , in which gauged q - balls ( for simplicity , from here on , we call @xmath0 gauged q - balls `` gauged q - balls '' ) were examined analytically and numerically .",
    "one can also recall papers @xcite , where gauged q - balls were examined mainly from a theoretical point of view , as well as papers @xcite , where solutions for gauged q - ball were obtained numerically .",
    "it is clear that if the backreaction of the gauge field on the scalar field is small , the characteristics of gauged q - balls ( charge , energy , etc . )",
    "do not differ considerably from those of ordinary nongauged q - balls ( see paper @xcite , in which this issue was examined in detail ) .",
    "meanwhile , the most interesting cases are those in which backreaction of the gauge field can not be neglected . in the general case ,",
    "the latter realizes not only if the corresponding coupling constant is large , but even when the coupling constant is rather small , but the other parameters of the solution are such that contribution of the gauge field is considerable . in the present paper",
    "we examine , both analytically and numerically , such differences between nongauged and gauged cases .",
    "in particular , we show that in some cases gauged q - balls may exist for such values of the parameters , for which nongauged q - balls do not exist at all . and vice versa , it is possible that there are no gauged q - balls for the values of the parameters for which nongauged q - balls exist .",
    "the obtained results demonstrate that gauged q - balls possess properties , which can be completely different from those of q - balls in the nongauged case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we present the general setup and introduce the notations that will be used throughout the paper . in section  3",
    "we present some analytical results related to gauged q - balls . in section  4 we examine numerically two models with different scalar field potentials . the obtained results are briefly discussed in the last section .",
    "we consider the action , describing the simplest @xmath0 gauge invariant scalar field theory in four - dimensional space - time , in the form @xmath5 and take the standard spherically symmetric ansatz for the scalar and gauge fields",
    "@xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 are real functions .",
    "below we will consider solutions such that the function @xmath8 has no nodes . without loss of generality",
    "we take @xmath10 .",
    "it is obvious that , according to ( [ ans1])([ans3 ] ) , we can use the effective action @xmath11 where @xmath12 . for the scalar field potential , the conditions @xmath13 are supposed to fulfill in order to ensure the existence of the vacuum solution @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the equations of motion , following from effective action ( [ effaction ] ) , take the form @xmath16 for the numerical analysis , it is more convenient to use the combination @xmath17 instead of the field @xmath9 . with this notation ,",
    "equations ( [ eqg1 ] ) , ( [ eqg2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the value of the frequency @xmath20 is now defined as @xmath21 .",
    "the charge of a gauged q - ball can be defined as , but below we will use the charge @xmath22 defined by ( [ chargedef ] ) , which simplifies comparison with the nongauged case . ] @xmath23 according to @xcite , the sign of @xmath24 always coincides with the sign of @xmath20 , whereas @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "thus , without loss of generality we can consider @xmath27 , which leads to @xmath28 .",
    "the energy of a gauged q - ball at rest is defined by @xmath29    it is well known that for ordinary ( nongauged ) q - balls the relation @xmath30 holds . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the same relation also holds for @xmath0 gauged q - balls .",
    "we will use it for an extra check of our numerical results .",
    "to begin with , let us discuss the allowed values of the frequency @xmath20 .",
    "suppose that our scalar field potential is such that the relation @xmath31 holds . in the most cases nongauged ( i.e. , with global @xmath0 symmetry )",
    "q - balls exist only for @xmath32 , whereas @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "so , it is universally accepted that for gauged q - balls the values of the frequency @xmath20 are also bounded from above as @xmath32 ( recall that we take @xmath27 ) .",
    "indeed , it was shown in @xcite using the perturbation method in the effective coupling constant that the total energy of gauged q - ball diverges for @xmath35 even in the special case in which the corresponding nongauged q - ball exists and has finite charge and energy , which indicates the breakdown of the linear approximation at some @xmath36 ( moreover , as it was shown in @xcite , such a breakdown of the linear approximation for the correction is inherent to models of gauged q - balls ) .",
    "thus , the divergence of total energy in the linear approximation can not be used as an indication of the absence of a solution to the full set of nonlinear equations . ] . in @xcite",
    "it was stated that the condition @xmath32 is required to have localized solutions without oscillations for the scalar field .",
    "however , our numerical analysis shows that gauged q - balls with finite charge and energy for @xmath35 may exist even if the corresponding solution in the nongauged case does not exist at all . below we will present some analytical considerations which support this statement .",
    "first , we consider the usual case @xmath32 and suppose that there exists a gauged q - ball solution with finite charge and energy such that @xmath37 for large @xmath36 . for such large @xmath36 the equation for the scalar field can be rewritten as @xmath38 the solution to this equation , tending to zero as @xmath39 , can be easily obtained and takes the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a constant and @xmath42 is the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind .",
    "it is not difficult to show ( see appendix  a ) that for @xmath43 we get for ( [ frinfty ] ) @xmath44 this formula resembles the naively expected result @xmath45 , the difference is caused by taking into account the electromagnetic potential @xmath37 for large @xmath36 .",
    "but formula ( [ frinfty1 ] ) has a singular behavior in the limit @xmath34 , which clearly indicates that the case @xmath35 should be considered separately .    equation ( [ lineqf ] ) for @xmath35 also has a solution , ensuring the finiteness of charge and energy .",
    "indeed , let us suppose that solution to the full set of nonlinear equations exists and has the charge @xmath22 .",
    "then , far away from the center of the q - ball , we can write for the scalar field @xmath46 the solution to this equation , tending to zero as @xmath39 , takes the form @xmath47 where @xmath41 is a constant and @xmath48 is the modified bessel function of the second kind . for large @xmath36",
    "this solution behaves as @xmath49 on sees that due to the long - range action of the electromagnetic potential @xmath9 , the behavior of the scalar field at @xmath39 differs considerably from the nongauged case , in which one expects @xmath50 for @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , one may naively expect that the repulsive nature of the electrostatic interaction would prevent from forming a gauged q - ball for such a value of @xmath20 ( recall that usually the corresponding nongauged q - ball has an infinite charge for @xmath35 ) .",
    "the argumentation presented above shows that it is not so .",
    "this statement is also confirmed by the numerical results , which will be presented in the next section .    it should be noted that it is possible to show analytically that in the limit @xmath34 solution ( [ frinfty ] ) transforms into solution ( [ frinfty2 ] ) , see appendix  b.    a few words about the case @xmath51",
    ". the form of equation ( [ lineqf ] ) suggests that the corresponding solutions for the scalar field are oscillatory for @xmath39 , leading to infinite charge and energy .",
    "more precisely , the leading term of a solution to equation ( [ lineqf ] ) takes the form @xmath52 the latter formula supports the assumption that there are no gauged q - balls for @xmath51 , which was also confirmed by the numerical analysis",
    ".    one can think that it looks rather strange that there exist solutions with finite charge for @xmath53 , whereas no solutions with finite charge are expected for @xmath51 .",
    "however , a similar situation can be observed in the nongauged case .",
    "indeed , let us take a scalar field potential of the form @xmath54 it was noted in @xcite that @xmath55 in the limit @xmath34 for @xmath56 ( one can easily check numerically that the corresponding solutions for the scalar field indeed exist ) .",
    "more precisely , @xmath57 for @xmath32 .",
    "meanwhile , it is possible to show analytically that there are no q - ball solutions for @xmath58 ( to show it in a simple way one can use the scale transformation technique , proposed in @xcite , supplemented by transformations of the fields themselves ; see , for example , @xcite , where such a method was applied to the more complicated case of gauged q - balls ) .",
    "thus , this example indicates that the situation with the existence of a finite charge for @xmath35 in the gauged case is not so unique .",
    "the numerical solutions for gauged q - balls , which will be presented below , were obtained in two steps . on the first step",
    "the shooting method , which solves the boundary value problem by reducing it to the solution of the initial value problem , was used . according to this method",
    ", one should adjust the initial data for the system of equations at one of the boundaries ( at the origin of gauged q - ball in our case ) in such a way that the solution satisfies required conditions at the second boundary ( for large @xmath36 in our case ) .",
    "the shooting method is very simple and it is easy to implement it , but it fails to find gauged q - ball solutions for large @xmath36 , where the scalar field falls off to zero exponentially , see relations  ,  . to find a solution for such large values of the coordinate @xmath36 using the shooting method , one has to fine tune the initial data with very high accuracy , which may even exceed the truncation error of double precision floating - point numbers .",
    "moreover , by taking the box of a small size one can mistake spurious solutions ( such as oscillating solutions for @xmath51 ) for correct monotonic solutions of the boundary value problem .",
    "so , these problems make the shooting method not fully applicable for our task . in order to overcome them ,",
    "the solutions obtained on the first step ( i.e. , for the values of @xmath36 which are not very large ) were supplemented by analytical solutions defined by formulas  ,  . on the second step , the resulted `` combined solutions '' were used as the initial approximation of the solutions to the boundary value problem for discretized version of the system of equations  ,  .",
    "then these solutions were improved iteratively by the gauss - seidel red - black relaxations , accelerated with the help of multigrid technique .",
    "the additional cross - checks of the final results were performed using the known theoretical relations for gauged q - balls , such as , for example , @xmath59  @xcite .      at first",
    ", we consider the potential of form @xmath61 where @xmath62 . at the very beginning it is convenient to make the following redefinition of the coordinate @xmath36 and the fields : @xmath63 in these notations , the system of equations ( [ eqg1a ] ) , ( [ eqg2a ] ) takes the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "we see that the only effective parameter in this system of equations is @xmath67 . since @xmath68",
    ", we will be looking for solutions such that @xmath69 , which corresponds to @xmath53 .     for different values of the parameter @xmath67 ( thick lines ) .",

    "meanwhile , in the nongauged case the q - ball charge tends to infinity while @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "as it was demonstrated in section  3 , it is not so for the gauged case , in which one may expect the existence of a q - ball with finite charge and energy .     for different values of the parameter @xmath67 ( thick lines ) .",

    "[ fig1 ] . however , no essential changes in the behavior of the @xmath73 dependencies were found .",
    "] we also performed the numerical analysis for @xmath79 .",
    "no solutions of form ( [ ans1])([ans3 ] ) with finite charge and energy were found .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] one can find the @xmath80 dependencies for different values of the parameter @xmath67 in comparison with the nongauged case .",
    "profiles of the scalar field for different values of @xmath75 and for @xmath78 are presented in fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] , demonstrating a remarkable agreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "now we consider the piecewise potential of form @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the heaviside step function with the convention @xmath84 ( such piecewise potentials for the case of nongauged q - balls were introduced in @xcite and thoroughly examined in @xcite ) .",
    "again , it is convenient to pass to the new variables @xmath85 in these notations , the system of equations ( [ eqg1a ] ) , ( [ eqg2a ] ) takes the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 , which is the only effective parameter in this system of equations .",
    "again , since @xmath68 , we will be looking for solutions such that @xmath69 , which corresponds to @xmath53 .",
    "the charge of the q - ball takes the form @xmath88 whereas the energy is @xmath89    in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] one can see several examples of @xmath73 diagrams for this model .     for different values of the parameter @xmath90 ( thick lines ) .",
    "the thin lines stand for the nongauged case .",
    "the circles on the plots mark the points with @xmath70 , the triangles mark the points with @xmath91 , the asterisks mark the points with @xmath92 , the boxes also mark the points with @xmath70 . ]",
    "we see a completely unexpected behavior of the corresponding @xmath73 dependencies .",
    "first , we see that , contrary to the case of the previous model , now the parameter @xmath20 does not uniquely define the charge of the q - ball .",
    "indeed , except the q - ball corresponding to a minimal value of @xmath20 ( these points are marked by asterisks ) , there exist two q - balls with different charges for each value of @xmath20 .",
    "we have the following explanation of this fact .",
    "indeed , in the nongauged case the charge tends to infinity in the limits @xmath93 and @xmath34 @xcite . according to the results of section  3",
    ", the nongauged limit @xmath34 transforms into the q - ball with @xmath35 .",
    "this q - ball corresponds to the lower points with @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] ( these points are marked by the circles ) , and its existence is not surprising .",
    "now let us consider another limit , namely @xmath93 . from @xcite we know that if @xmath26 for a gauged q - ball , then @xmath25 .",
    "since there is not a q - ball solution with the zero charge for @xmath26 in the nongauged case @xcite , there should be no such solution in the gauged case too .",
    "it is also improbable that the charge of a gauged q - ball tends to infinity in the limit @xmath93  the value of @xmath20 tends to zero , whereas @xmath94 is a monotonically growing function such that @xmath95 for any @xmath36 .",
    "thus , @xmath96 , whereas a solution for @xmath9 should support the existence of a large charge .",
    "the latter situation seems to be unrealizable .",
    "so , the @xmath73 curve modifies with respect to the nongauged case in order to overcome this problem and to maintain its continuity , which is realized in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ]  the curve just turns back at the point of the minimal possible value of  @xmath20 . at this point",
    ", the value of the charge behaves as @xmath97 for small values of @xmath90 .     for different values of the parameter @xmath90 ( thick lines ) .",
    "the thin lines stand for the nongauged case .",
    "the circles on the plots mark the points with @xmath70 , the triangles mark the points with @xmath91 , the asterisks mark the points with @xmath92 , the boxes also mark the points with @xmath70 . ]",
    "it is interesting to note that now it is the parameter @xmath98 that uniquely characterizes a gauged q - ball , not @xmath20 like in the nongauged case or even in the gauged case discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "we can also see that the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] become smaller while increasing the value of the parameter @xmath90 . for @xmath99",
    "no gauged q - balls were found .",
    "analogous observation of nonexistence of gauged q - ball for the values of the coupling constant larger than some critical value was made in @xcite , where the model with supersymmetry motivated scalar field potential , which has the form similar to ( [ potential ] ) , was examined .",
    "a remark is in order here .",
    "the results presented in this and in the previous subsections suggest that there exists a maximal possible charge of gauged q - ball ( of course , its value should depend on the model at hand ) .",
    "we think that it is not so in the general case ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "however , this statement seems to be valid for models with @xmath100 .",
    "it should be noted that this restriction is not connected with the restriction on the charge of _ stable _ gauged q - balls @xcite , which was shown to be incorrect in @xcite .    .",
    "here @xmath101 . ]    , @xmath101 . ]    , @xmath101 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] one sees the @xmath80 dependencies for different values of the parameter @xmath90 in comparison with the nongauged case .",
    "the cusps on the corresponding curves , which are marked by triangles , correspond to the points with @xmath91 , which are also marked by triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] .",
    "the existence of the cusps follows from the fact that @xmath30 for gauged q - balls @xcite .",
    "for the completeness , we also present the scalar field profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] ) , the effective charge density @xmath102 ( fig .  [ fig4b ] ) and the effective pressure @xmath103 ( fig .  [ fig5b ] ) for different values of @xmath75 and for @xmath101 .",
    "the effective ( dimensionless ) pressure is defined in the standard way through the energy - momentum tensor @xcite as @xmath104 one can show that the equality @xmath105 ( the so - called `` von laue condition '' @xcite ) fulfills in the general case ( this equality was also used for the additional cross - check of our numerical results ) .",
    "the values of @xmath75 for these plots are chosen such that they approximately correspond to the marked points in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] in the clockwise order : @xmath70  circle , @xmath106  triangle , @xmath107  asterisk ( the point of the turnover ) , @xmath70  box .",
    "there exists a dip in the vicinity of @xmath108 on the charge density curve in fig .",
    "[ fig4b ] for @xmath70 , clearly indicating the repulsive nature of the electrostatic interaction in the gauged q - ball .",
    "such dips on the charge density curves appear for q - balls from the upper part of the @xmath73 diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] ) for @xmath109 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , according to fig .",
    "[ fig5b ] , the pressure can be negative even in the center of gauged q - balls .",
    "as it was demonstrated above , gauged q - balls posses surprising properties which differ considerably from those of q - balls in the nongauged case .",
    "namely , it was shown that there may exist gauged q - ball solutions with a finite charge even for @xmath35 ( if @xmath110 ) , which is usually impossible in the nongauged case .",
    "the corresponding analytical considerations were supported by the numerical calculations in two models with different scalar field potentials . moreover",
    ", numerical analysis shows that even when @xmath33 as @xmath93 in the nongauged case , the charge in the gauged case remains finite for all allowed values of @xmath20 . as a consequence ,",
