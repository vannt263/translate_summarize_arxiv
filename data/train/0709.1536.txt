    "the log returns of financial time series @xmath0 ( share prices , stock indices , foreign exchange rates , etc . )",
    "@xmath1 usually presents the following features : they are uncorrelated , their volatility clusters , they have fat - tailed distributions ( leptokurtosis ) , a leverage effect is present ( changes in stock prices tend to be negatively correlated with changes in volatility ) , their autocorrelation function decays exponentially , their absolute values present a long range dependence @xcite .",
    "one of the most used stochastic models that reproduces some of these features is the generalized auto regressive conditional heteroskedasticity ( garch ) model having the variance expressed as a linear function of past squared innovations and earlier calculated conditional variances @xcite .",
    "there are various generalizations of the garch model , however the most used in practical applications is its simplest form , garch(1,1 ) .    according to relation ( [ logret ] )",
    "the stationary garch(1,1 ) process is suitable for modeling time series for which @xmath2 has a linear trend , i.e. the original time series @xmath0 contains an exponential trend .",
    "but the nonlinear trends in @xmath3 are not eliminated by the differentiation ( [ logret ] ) .",
    "this problem is amplified in the case of a nonmonotonic trend .",
    "an alternative to the stationary modeling of financial series is the hypothesis of a nonstationary evolution .",
    "for example stric and granger @xcite propose a nonstationary model locally approximated by a stationary one @xmath4 where @xmath5 are i.i.d with @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the unconditional mean @xmath8 and the unconditional variance @xmath9 are functions of @xmath10 if a nonstationary series ( [ xtnest ] ) is modeled with a stationary process , then the deterministic trend @xmath11 is confounded with a stochastic trend and the model tends to approach its nonstationarity limit . in the case of garch model this is the so called igarch effect .",
    "in this paper we study the influence of a deterministic trend on the parameters of garch(1,1 ) model .",
    "we use a monte carlo method in order to evaluate the influence of the detrending errors on the variability of the estimated garch(1,1 )  parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we shortly present the garch(1,1 ) model and we study the intrinsic variability of its parameters . in the third section an automatic method to generate artificially trends",
    "is described .",
    "then we present the variability of the garch(1,1 ) parameters due to the detrending of an artificially added deterministic component and the last section is dedicated to conclusions .",
    "the garch(1,1 ) process is a real - valued discrete time stochastic process @xmath12@xmath13 where @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite . if @xmath17 , then garch(1,1 ) process is wide sense stationary with @xmath18 var@xmath19 and cov@xmath20var@xmath21 .",
    "we analyze the daily dow jones composite ( djc ) series containing @xmath22 values between 01 february 1980 and 31 december 1999 when a deterministic trend is likely to exist .",
    "the parameters of the garch(1,1 ) model obtained using the maximum likelihood method for the log returns of this series are : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 with these values we have generated three index series with the same initial value on the same time interval . in fig .",
    "[ figdj1 ] one observes large differences between the generated series and the initial one , especially for large @xmath26 .",
    "this behavior is in accordance with the fact that garch model is suitable only for relatively short periods of time @xcite .",
    "when the series length is large , then the garch parameters are close to the nonstationarity limit ( @xmath27 ) and the deterministic trend ( if it exists ) is lost or is strongly distorted because it is replaced with a stochastic one . in the case of the analyzed djc index @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the variability of the realizations of a garch process with given parameters is very large , especially when the series length is large .        in order to correctly evaluate the variability of the parameters due to detrending ,",
    "it must be compared with the intrinsic variability of the garch(1,1 ) parameters for time series without trends .",
    "the intrinsic variability is determined using a monte carlo simulation . for a given length @xmath29",
    "we generate 500 realizations of a garch(1,1 ) process with the parameters ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) . for each realization the garch(1,1 ) parameters are estimated by applying the maximum likelihood method .",
    "the relative standard deviation of the garch(1,1 ) parameters decreases to an almost stationary value for large values of @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_var_garch]a ) . generally , the mean of the estimated parameters almost coincides with the values used for generating the series with the exception of @xmath33 ( fig .  [ fig_var_garch]b ) . in the following we consider series with length @xmath34 which have a variability near the stationary value .",
    "( b ) for statistical ensembles with 500 numerically generated series with dj parameters for each length @xmath29 . ]",
    "in order to be representative , the monte carlo statistics must contain a large number of numerical simulations with variability comparable with those appearing in practical applications .",
    "we describe an automatic method for generating time series containing a deterministic trend which satisfies these conditions .",
    "the generation of a large number of trends with a significant variability using a fixed functional form requires a large number of parameters .",
    "for example , a polynomial trend must have a large enough degree , hence the number of its coefficients is also large . if we choose the coefficients by means of a random algorithm , then the form of the generated trend is difficult to be controlled .",
    "usually the resulting trend has only a few parts with significant monotonic variation .",
    "we generate a trend @xmath35 , @xmath36 by joining together @xmath37 monotonic semiperiods of sinus with random amplitudes and lengths . in this way",
    "we obtain a large enough variability for the generated trends and we can control the number and the amplitude of its monotonic parts . we need only three parameters : the length of the series @xmath29 ( in the following @xmath34 ) , the number of monotonic parts @xmath37 ( in our tests @xmath38 ) and the minimum number of points in a part equal with 50 .",
    "the amplitudes of the sinusoidal parts will be random numbers with uniform distribution @xmath39 .",

    "first we generate a garch(1,1 ) time series @xmath45 with given parameters ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "then we calculate the series @xmath47 ( corresponding to the logarithm of a price series ) and we add an automatically generated trend , @xmath48 .",
    "the relation between these two components in the resulting series is characterized by the ratio @xmath49 of the amplitude of the trend and of the noise@xmath50 if we randomly choose the number @xmath37 of trend parts between two given values @xmath51 and @xmath52 and the ratio @xmath49 between @xmath53 and @xmath54 we obtain a significant statistics .    from the series @xmath55 we extract a polynomial estimated trend @xmath56 , @xmath57 and we calculate the estimated returns @xmath58 .",
    "then we evaluate the garch(1,1 ) parameters ( @xmath59 ) using the maximum likelihood method .",
    "when we choose the degree of the polynomial estimated trend we must take into account that if it is too large , then the estimated trend begins to follow the fluctuations of the noise . from numerical tests it has resulted an optimal degree equal to @xmath60 .",
    "figure  [ fig_vargarch_dj_trend ] shows the results obtained by applying the evaluation method of the variability of garch(1,1 ) parameters described in the previous section for statistical ensembles of 100 time series generated with the djc parameters for different values of @xmath49 and @xmath37 . from fig .",

    "figure [ fig_vargarch_dj_trend]b confirms this result by means of the relative standard deviation for @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the garch(1,1 ) parameters are not influenced by detrending a nonlinear trend if the noise is generated using ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) .     between the trend and the noise amplitude .",
