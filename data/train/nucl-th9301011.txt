    "high @xmath4 @xmath0 interactions in nuclei have gained renewed interest following the suggestion @xcite that fluctuations in nucleon size may show observable effects due to color screening . of particular interest is the nuclear transparency , @xmath3 , which is defined as the probability that a proton traversing a nucleus makes one and only one collision with a nucleon and that the emerging nucleons make no further interactions .",
    "it can apply to any interaction , but in this paper we consider the case where the basic interaction is either a proton - proton or an electron - proton interaction .",
    "the transparency is extracted from the experimentally obtained quasielastic @xmath0 events using the factorization assumption @xcite : @xmath5 this is the expression found in eq .",

    "finally @xmath12 is a spectral function , which depends on the proton - nucleon interaction cross section , @xmath13 , and on the spatial distribution of nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "it is normalized to unity .    using eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross1 ] ) @xmath3 can be extracted from the experimental data by weighting each observed event with the reciprocal of @xmath14 , to remove the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath11 and @xmath10 . for an experiment designed to accept events of any momentum @xmath11 and missing energy @xmath10",
    "there is no need to know @xmath12 , since @xmath15 . in practice ,",
    "at incident momenta of 6 - 10 gev which are much larger than the average @xmath16 , corrections for apparatus acceptance as a function of @xmath11 are not difficult to obtain , especially since @xmath17 falls rapidly with @xmath16 .",
    "if there were no initial state or final state interactions of the protons traversing the nucleus , @xmath3 would be unity .",
    "thus @xmath3 measures these initial and final state interactions which are sensitive to the total proton - nucleon cross section , @xmath13 , which in turn will depend on the magnitude of the color screening .",
    "one of the important ideas in color transparency is that @xmath3 will increase with the momentum transfer , @xmath8 , observed in the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "thus we examine how to determine @xmath18 in a way that will depend least on theoretical calculations of its magnitude .",
    "this is also of value since it bypasses the strong sensitivity of @xmath3 to the nucleon density near the nuclear edge .",
    "( in general only a peripheral reaction will have a single scattering , so that edge effects are enhanced . )",
    "we examine the special case of the @xmath8 dependence of the nuclear cross section as measured in a @xmath0 reaction where the exiting protons are observed at the angles @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    in this paper",

    "the spectral function @xmath17 becomes independent of @xmath10 ( we denote this simplified function by @xmath21 in this work ) .",
    "even with this additional approximation , the expression for the cross section is rather complicated , see ref .",
    "however , we show that the transparency depends only the nuclear proton radial distribution @xmath2 .",
    "the density @xmath22 can be obtained from elastic @xmath23 scattering without recourse to knowledge of the individual single particle wave functions . after using closure",
    "the transparency @xmath3 turns out to be related to the classical probability that there are no initial or final state scatters accompanying the @xmath0 high @xmath4 interaction on a single nucleon .",
    "we shall see later how to take into account both the momentum and missing energy taken off by the undetected nucleons measured in a fully reconstructed @xmath0 experiment .",
    "we also show how the effect of nucleon correlations , which affect the calculation of @xmath3 , can be included in a previously developed monte - carlo formalism for glauber scattering , and compare various model assumptions with the data .",

    "the result of this quantum - mechanical approximation is to obtain a simple limit : the cross section , for an incident proton of energy , @xmath24 , on a nucleon with wave function @xmath25 becomes the probability , @xmath26 , of finding that nucleon in the nucleus with momentum @xmath16 , times the @xmath0 cross section at the on - shell values of @xmath27 and the momentum transfer , @xmath8 . while @xmath8 is directly obtainable from the measured momenta , @xmath11 and @xmath10 refer to the momentum and binding energies in the _ initial _ state which are not directly measurable .    for interaction with a single nucleon of independent particle wave function @xmath25 , the result is well known @xcite : @xmath28}{dt } d^3 k. \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ]    in particular @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fourier transform of the nucleon wave function , @xmath31 ,    @xmath32    it is useful to recall that , in eq .",

    "this result relies on the use of a closure approximation , so that there are no interference terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) .",
    "let us repeat this equation ( [ eq:8 ] ) once more , since it is one of the important results of this paper : @xmath72 .",

    "@xcite in their calculations .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) can be understood as the probability that there is no nuclear interaction of the incoming or outgoing protons along the paths @xmath73 and @xmath57 determined by @xmath74 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",

    "( [ eq:8 ] ) in the neighborhood of the struck nucleon .",
    "these corrections were calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and are discussed and included by lee and miller  @xcite .",
    "we have also calculated this probability using a monte carlo method which automatically @xcite excludes the nucleon participating in the high @xmath4 @xmath0 interaction from the absorptive path .",
    "equations ( [ eq:8 ] ) and ( [ eq:14 ] ) allow @xmath3 to be determined directly from the proton charge density , @xmath2 , which can be obtained from elastic e - nucleus scattering rather than requiring a detailed knowledge of the ground - state wave functions for all the nucleons of a complicated nucleus , which is the procedure followed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the correlations of the struck nucleon with its surroundings make it less plausible to find another particle very close to this nucleon .",
    "this can be most simply be taken into account by replacing the one - body density @xmath22 in all three equations ( [ eq:7 ] ) by the probability to find a particle at position @xmath75 along one of the three legs , if there is one at the beginning ( at position @xmath76 ) , @xmath77 here we have defined a correlation function @xmath78 .",
    "this entity is usually approximated by the result of a nuclear matter calculation . as is argued in the appendix ,",
    "however , this correlation function should also take into account the @xmath79 corrections arising from the fact that one should not include the struck nucleon among the absorbing material .",
    "thus , for no correlations , we find @xmath80 , which for light nuclei gives a considerable correction to the transparency .",
    "the glauber model has proved to be quite successful in understanding p - a and heavy ion interactions at high energies ( @xmath81 5 gev ) .",
    "the basic quantities such a calculation are the so - called glauber coefficients , @xmath82 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath82 gives the probability that a proton makes @xmath83 collisions in traversing a nucleus , while remaining on a straight path ( this assumption is similar to the eikonal approximation ) .",
    "one approximate way for obtaining the glauber coefficients is based on a monte - carlo generations of particles in a nucleus .",
    "one first generates the positions of nucleons in a nucleus randomly , according to the nuclear density @xmath2 .",
    "one then follows the path of the incoming proton through the nucleus , and counts the number of collisions .",
    "the collisions are treated geometrically , and are assumed to take place whenever the impact parameter for the incoming proton and any target nucleon is less than @xmath84 obtained from the proton - nucleon cross section , with @xmath85 .",
    "the number of collisions is thus equal to the number of centers of particles in a cylinder of radius @xmath84 around the path of the projectile , see fig .",
    "[ fig : collision ] .",
    "here we have taken into account the fact that at very high energies the path of the incoming particle through the nucleus can be approximated by a straight line .",
    "such a probabilistic calculation of the @xmath82 is known to be equivalent to the quantum mechanical glauber model in the case of factorized ground state densities @xcite and has been used over the last decade to determine the @xmath82 which are used in models that study multiplicities @xcite , @xmath86 distributions @xcite , leading hadron distributions @xcite and many other measured quantities in p - a and heavy ion collisions at high energies .    for our transparency calculations we need determine the probability that if the projectile nucleon makes a large - angle @xmath0 scatter , no other soft collisions take place .",
    "we sum over all particles in the nucleus , and assume that the hard - collision takes place at one particle at a time .",
    "we then look at the incoming path , and also follow the paths of the two final state protons , and look whether a geometric scattering takes place along each path .",
    "we allow the nucleons to scatter into non - zero angles as determined by the @xmath0 kinematics .",
    "the calculation is similar but not identical with the eikonal - dwia calculation discussed in the previous section .",
    "the expression for @xmath3 resembles eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) with the exponential factor @xmath60 replaced by the probability that there are no other interactions except the hard @xmath87 interaction along the appropriate path .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ang ] we show the dependence of the transparency on the laboratory angle of the @xmath87 scatter .",
    "the kinematics are usually chosen so that the cm scattering angle is @xmath88 , we see that the transparency increases trivially as the energy increases .",
    "we have used @xmath89 , which we consider to be a reasonable value for the high - energy @xmath87 cross - section in nuclei .",
    "this value will be used in all calculations in this paper .",
    "one basic difference between this glauber calculation and the dwia calculation is that the monte carlo treats the nucleus as composed of confined nucleons of finite volume while the dwia treats a continuous matter distribution .",
    "we believe that at 10 gev , where the wavelength of the projectile is smaller than the nucleon diameter , one can not neglect the `` lumpiness '' of the nuclear medium .",
    "in contrast to the eikonal calculation discussed in the previous section , in the glauber calculation the target nucleon participating in the hard @xmath0 scatter is by definition not counted in the absorptive path .",
    "this does not mean that nuclear correlations do not have an effect on the result of the glauber calculation , but the effect can be different .",
    "let us investigate the generation of correlated nuclei using our glauber - monte carlo algorithm .      as in the eikonal - dwia calculations we wish to use a nuclear matter calculation as a guide to construct a correlated sampling of a finite nucleus .",
    "there are several reasons why we can not use a correlation function directly as input to the calculation .",
    "the most important reason is the fluid nature of the nuclear many - body system , which induces many - particle correlations .",
    "let us first look at the case of nuclear matter .",
    "if we consider particles with only two - body interaction , one expects that the probability of finding the particles can be written as a product of two - body correlation factors , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a two - body correlation factor .",
    "this function should approach one for large separations .",
    "the point is that , for nuclear matter , the correlation length ",
    "the distance in which @xmath92 approaches one  is comparable to the internucleon spacing .",
    "this means that in general we will be able to find triples of particles ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) in the monte - carlo sample such that at least two of the three @xmath91 s ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) differ significantly from one .",
    "this leads to effective ( induced ) three - body correlations .",
    "if we now calculate the two - particle distribution , the probability to find one particle at @xmath99 and another at @xmath100 , @xmath101 we find that the function correlation function @xmath78 is in general different from @xmath91 .",
    "( note that in the low - density ( gas ) approximation @xmath102 . )",
    "this can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : ghardcore ] and [ fig : ggauss ] for two choices of the function @xmath91 . we have used a monte - carlo algorithm where we generate n particles in a square box with periodic boundary conditions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ghardcore ] we show the effect of a hard - core interaction , @xmath103 as one can see the resulting curves do not have very much in common with the results of more standard nuclear matter calculations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ggauss ] ) .",
    "the hard core reduces the available positions in configuration space so that for the large core radii each particle is surrounded by a number of particles that almost touch .",
    "this leads to the strong peak in the correlation function for @xmath104 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggauss ] we use a gaussian @xmath91 , @xmath105 this function results in a @xmath78 that  for @xmath106  is very similar to the realistic correlation function used by benhar _",
    "@xcite in their calculation for the @xmath1 transparency .",
    "this is what we use in our further calculations .      whereas for infinite nuclear matter we can have an arbitrary , but translationally invariant , correlation function , the correlation function for finite nuclei must satisfy a normalization condition",
    "this follows from the equation @xmath107 which after the substitution @xmath108 becomes @xmath109 we obviously also require that the one - body distribution coming from the monte - carlo generation takes on the form @xmath110 .",
    "we wish to develop an approach to finite nuclei that is close in spirit to the nuclear matter calculation discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "therefor we use an approach based on two - body correlation factors .",
    "we use a @xmath111-particle distribution @xmath22 of the form @xmath112 @xmath113 is a normalization factor , that could be absorbed in the effective single particle densities @xmath114 .",

    "unfortunately a nucleus is more like a fluid than a gas , so that we have to solve for @xmath114 .    in this work",

    "the effect of correlations on the monte - carlo calculations leads to a result 33% larger than the correlated eikonal calculation .",
    "this result seems to be mostly due to finite @xmath123 corrections , which are missing in the eikonal calculation , and are important for this light nucleus .",
    "it is important to note that the effect of correlations in the monte - carlo calculations is to significantly enhance the transparency .",
    "this shows that one should take into account two effects .",

    "secondly , the effect of correlations on the local environment of the struck particle is ver important as well .",
    "all of these effects , the sensitivity of @xmath3 to the shape of the tail of @xmath2 , to the nuclear `` granularity '' , or to the effect of `` nuclear correlations '' in the eikonal model serve to emphasize that the _ magnitude _ of @xmath3 may be a poor quantity to use for color transparency studies .",
    "we note from the defining equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) , that the cross section depends on three quantities,@xmath124 , @xmath3 , and @xmath125 .",
    "if our goal is to search for the presence of color screening , the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath3 , and not its magnitude , is the crucial quantity . also , @xmath124 has intrinsic interest , but not necessarily to the extraction of @xmath18 .",
    "the experimental process for extracting @xmath3 from the data has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite and also in the thesis of guang yin fang @xcite .",
    "the experimentalists take the factorized form ( eq .  ( [ eq:14 ] ) ) of the nuclear cross section as their basic assumption which we see is the same as the dwia result . to extract @xmath3 each observed event",
    "can be weighted with @xmath126 = @xmath127 to correct for the cross section dependence on @xmath16 and @xmath10 , and is also divided by @xmath128 .",
    "( ralston and pire @xcite have pointed out the need to consider variations of the @xmath0 cross section from the simple @xmath129 behavior . )",
    "if there were no acceptance biases , so that one could use the fact that the integral over all @xmath16 is unity , @xmath3 would be obtained directly .    since , strictly speaking , @xmath130 , and since events with different @xmath8 might appear at different angles , one can consider adding to future analyses the theoretical weighting factor , @xmath131 .",
    "otherwise a @xmath132 dependence on @xmath8 might appear as a spurious dependence of the transparency on @xmath8 .",
    "the rise in @xmath3 resulting in neglecting this effect can be read from fig .",
    "[ fig : ang ] for the special case of an equal angle configuration .",
    "although we have emphasized that the magnitude of @xmath3 is model dependent , the dependence of @xmath3 on the exiting angles would not be expected to be .",
    "( the weight , @xmath133 , is easily calculated from our available monte carlo code . )",
    "thus we conclude that the data analysis can be refined by using this angular weighting factor for more precise determination of the average @xmath3 in the experiment .",
    "it might seem on a casual analysis that one could use the transverse missing momentum spectrum observed from the data to predict the longitudinal momentum distribution , since the transverse momentum distribution is not sensitive to the strong @xmath7 dependence of the cross section .",
    "however whenever initial and final state interactions depend on the projectile axis , the transverse and longitudinal momentum distributions in @xmath134 are not identical",
    ". a nice internal check of the data would be to unweight the @xmath46 distribution with the cross section to see how much it differs from the transverse momentum distribution .",
    "this is important if the extraction of @xmath3 depends on a knowledge of these distributions in order to correct for apparatus acceptance as well as momentum cuts that might be applied to the data .",
    "it is important to realize that the dwia approximation results in a factorized cross section which involves an effective momentum distribution , @xmath135 .",
    "the binding energy @xmath10 has disappeared from this expression because of the sum over all final states in the closure approximation .",
    "if the experiment were to detect all @xmath0 events independent of @xmath16 and @xmath10 , this would not matter because that sum is unity .",
    "but @xmath136 is needed to carry out the monte carlo calculations used to find the true apparatus acceptance .",
    "this is just another way of saying that each event @xmath40 must be weighted by a @xmath137 .",
    "since protons of the same @xmath16 can be ejected from states with different binding energies ( and there is really a spectrum of excitation energies for each initial state ) , it is clear that the @xmath138 appearing in the factorized formula should be replaced by @xmath139 so @xmath10 appears both in @xmath17 and in s. but knowledge of the complete spectral function will not be needed if the apparatus is capable of accepting events of a wide enough range of @xmath11 and @xmath10 so that the integral of @xmath17 will be close to unity .",
    "finally , we point to an important experimental factor .",
    "while it is important to determine @xmath16 and @xmath10 for each event to correct for the strong @xmath7 dependence of the cross section , the key quantity determining the number of pure @xmath0 events , and hence @xmath3 , is the efficiency of the anticoincidence counters that are supposed to trigger on particles produced by the inelastic interactions .",
    "if these detectors remove events containing extra protons emitted because of the short range nucleon nucleon correlations they will lower @xmath3 . if they allow in an event containing a pion , they will increase @xmath3 , especially since such events will be given a high weight when @xmath11 is extracted from the reconstruction .",
    "thus complete knowledge of the anticoincidence efficiency is crucial to extracting @xmath3 .",
    "this requires generating the soft collisions from the known event structures to find the efficiencies at the different bombarding energies .",
    "we have demonstrated , using the dwi approximation , that the transparency depends directly on the nucleon spatial distribution @xmath140 and the p , p total cross section . to calculate @xmath3",
    "there is no need to know the transparency for each nucleon wave function .",
    "we obtain the classical result that the p - a cross section can be factorized into a @xmath16 independent transparency , @xmath141 , an effective `` normalized to unity '' momentum distribution @xmath124 , and the p , p cross section evaluated at the appropriate mandelstam variables .",
    "further we point out that the dwia calculations of lee and miller and our discrete nucleon calculation differ considerably in the magnitude of the `` nuclear correlations '' . in the latter we are dealing with finite size nucleons distributed throughout the nuclear volume rather than a smeared out uniform matter density , @xmath2 .",
