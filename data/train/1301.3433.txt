    "the modular structure of the mammalian visual cortex has been discovered in the seventhies by the pioneeristic work of hubel and wiesel @xcite .",
    "many families of cells contribute to sampling and coding the stimulus image .",
    "each family is sensible to a specific feature of the   of positions and orientations whose probability peaks follow elastica curves .",
    "williams and jacobs @xcite could use such stochastic processes to implement a mechanism of stochastic completion , and interpreted the probability kernel they obtained as tensors representing geometric connections on the space of positions and orientations associated to the neural representation of images due to simple cells .    many of such results dealing with differential geometry were given a unified framework under the new name of _ neurogeometry _ by petitot and tondud @xcite , who related the association fields of field hayess and hess with the contact geometry introduced by hoffmann and the elastica of mumford .",
    "the problem of edge organization in images was then addressed in terms of a stochastic process of the type of mumford , introducing nonlinearities in order to take into account the role of curvature , by august and zucker @xcite , while the variational approach of nitzberg , mumford and shiota was extended from edges to level lines of images by ambriosio and masnou @xcite .",
    "then , in @xcite , citti and sarti showed how the functional architecture could be described in terms of lie groups structures .",
    "they interpreted the geometric action of receptive profiles as a lifting of level lines into the space @xmath0 of positions and orientations , and addressed the problem of occlusion with a nonlinear diffusion - concentration process in such a space of liftings .",
    "in particular , this approach allows to introduce orientation , instead of depth , as a third dimension for the disentanglement of crossing level lines .",
    "moreover , by making use of the sub - riemannian structure associated to the lie symmetries of the euclidean motion group @xmath1 they could prove that their geometrical nonlinear diffusion approximates the variational result of ambrosio and masnou . in their model , then , contour completion is justified as a propagation in the sub - riemannian setting , and the integral curves of the vector fields that generate the lie algebra can be considered as a mathematical representation of the association fields of field , hayes and hess , hence proving the relation between neural mechanisms and image completion .",
    "this method was then concretely implemented in @xcite .",
    "the problem of boundary completion was also addressed from a slightly different point of view by zucker @xcite , who showed the role of frenet frames .",
    "exact solutions to the fokker - planck equation associated to mumford stochastic process were provided by duits and van almsick @xcite , and later duits and franken @xcite unified such stochastic approach with nonlinear mechanisms of the type of august and zucker , keeping left invariance with respect to the lie symmetry of the euclidean motion group and yet allowing the invertibility of the whole process .",
    "their result was applied to the problem of contour enhancement and contour completion , working on the whole lie group by means of a representation via suitably defined linear filters .",
    "this approach was then extended to different geometric setting by duits and fhr @xcite , again with applications to the processing of images .",
    "we also mention the works of hladky and pauls @xcite and boscain et al @xcite , where the authors provided technical developments on the structure of the sub - riemannian paths and minimal surfaces involved in the cited works .    in this paper",
    "we propose a mathematical model of cortical functional architecture for the processing of spatio - temporal visual information , that is compatible with both phenomenological experiments and neurophysiological findings .",
    "the adopted theoretical framework follows the outlined path of mathematical models of the activity of the visual cortex , and in particular it continues the geometric approach of citti and sarti @xcite to a space of higher dimension , since it takes into account time and velocity of stimuli .",
    "we will extend the stochastic process of mumford @xcite to this setting , working in a space of liftings arising from the filtering with spatio - temporal receptive profiles , and make use of assumptions like the ones of ermentrout and cowan @xcite in order to construct a population dynamics able to provide a new form of association fields adapted to the problem of motion integration and motion completion under occlusion .",
    "moreover , the resulting kernels will be comparable to measured neural activities in the presence of stimuli characterized by their direction of motion .",
    "our starting point in section [ sec : geometry ] is a process of detection resulting from linear filtering with three dimensional gabor functions with two spatial and one temporal dimensions , which have been proposed as a model of spatio - temporal receptive profiles of primary visual cortex simple cells ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "spatio - temporal gabor filters extend simple cells gabor behavior as spatial filters @xcite , that proved its usefulness for the classical task of edge detection , while its role for motion detection was already pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the gabor transform takes in input a moving image @xmath2 , where @xmath3 are spatial coordinates and @xmath4 is time and provides in output a representation of the signal in the phase space @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 representing spatio - temporal position and @xmath8 representing , respectively , spatial and temporal frequency .",
    "since we are mainly interested in spatio - temporal dynamical aspects , we will assign to temporal frequency the meaning of velocity @xmath9 on the @xmath10 coordinates .",
    "we will also select the subset of all detected features corresponding to a fixed value of @xmath11 .",
    "this will end up to be a 5d manifold , with a contact structure , induced by a normalization of the liuoville form .    in section [",
    "sec : diffusion ] we will outline that this constraint carries a notion of admissible curves @xcite in a deterministic and a stochastic setting , allowing to compute the kernels connecting filters in the 5d manifold .",
    "the stochastic processes are completely determined by the described structures of the tangent space of the 5d manifold and they turn out to be described by the fundamental solution of a fokker planck equation @xcite .",
    "in fact the processes contain diffusion in the fiber variables and transport along the remaining generators of admissible tangent directions , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "we will compute these kernels in two limit cases : the motion of a contour at a fixed time instant , and the motion of a point moving in time .",
    "the first one reduces to the geometry of contours , with a notion of instantaneous velocity , the second one corresponds to point trajectories in time , and can be related to the subset of the galilei group @xcite on the plane .    in section [ sec : truelife ] we will discuss the compatibility of the previously calculated kernels with psychophysiological findings reported in the recent literature . then we will insert the connectivity kernels computed in section [ sec : diffusion ] in a neural population activity model @xcite , regarding them as cortical facilitation patterns .    in section [",
    "sec : numerical ] we will use this population activity model equipped with the suitable connectivity kernels in two numerical simulations , comparing the results to recent phenomenological findings of the perception of contours in motion @xcite , and to fmri measurements of cortical neural activity related to motion perception @xcite .",
    "in this section we extend an approach introduced in @xcite that amounts to model each v1 simple cell in terms of its receptive profile , to interpret its action as a gabor filtering , and to introduce a geometry of the space compatible with the properties of the output . in this paper",
    "we will consider each cell as sensitive to a local orientation and apparent velocity , that is the velocity orthogonal to a moving stimulus .",
    "the collected data lies on a five dimensional manifold @xmath12 of space , time , orientation and velocity , a single cell being represented as a point on @xmath12 .",
    "the geometric structure of this manifold will be described in terms of a contact structure , that provides a constraint on the tangent space and on admissible connectivity among cells .",
    "it is known that the visual cortex decomposes the visual stimulus by measuring its local features .",
    "local orientation and direction of movement have been the first visual features of neurons in v1 that have been studied .",
    "receptive profiles ( rps ) are descriptors of the linear filtering behavior of a cell and they can be reconstructed by processing electrophysiological recordings @xcite . it has been shown that the spatial characteristics of these rps can be modeled by 2-dimensional gabor functions @xcite .",
    "however a large class of cells shows a very specific space - time behavior in which the spatial phase of the rp changes gradually as a function of time @xcite .",
    "although many models have been proposed to reproduce these dynamics @xcite , in @xcite it has been shown that a 3-dimensional sum - of - inseparable gabor model can fit very well experimental data of both separable and inseparable rps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gaborseq ] ) . following this approach ,",
    "we choose gaussian gabor filters centered at position @xmath13 on the image plane , activated around time @xmath7 , with spatial frequency @xmath14 , temporal frequency @xmath15 , spatial width @xmath16 ( circular gaussians ) and temporal width @xmath17 @xmath18 where we have used the abbreviations @xmath19 and @xmath20 . also note that the functions ( [ eq : insep ] ) correspond to the propagation of a two dimensional plane wave within the activating window with phase velocity @xmath21 the variable @xmath22 is canonically associated @xcite to the phase space @xmath23 endowed with the symplectic structure compatible with the complex structure of @xmath24 of variable @xmath25 , that is @xmath26 where we have denoted with @xmath27 the liouville form @xmath28",
    "since we are mainly interested in the geometry of level lines , our analysis can be restricted to the information captured by filters possessing a fixed central spatial frequency @xmath11 .",
    "this amounts to fixing a scale of oscillations , hence disregarding the harmonic content of the filtering by focusing on the features of orientations and velocity .",
    "we then obtain the reduced 1-form @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "this form is defined on the spatio - temporal phase space with fixed frequency , that is the 5-dimensional manifold @xmath31 and it is associated to every gabor filter as shown in fig .",

    "time @xmath32 is introduced as a base variable with the same role of @xmath33 .",
    "the dual variable of @xmath32 is @xmath9 , which has the same role of @xmath34 , both being the engrafted variables with respect to time and space .",
    "to every point of @xmath12 corresponds univocally a gabor filter whose parameters are the coordinates of the point itself .",
    "we will model the connectivity between points in the space @xmath12 in terms of admissible tangent directions of @xmath12 itself . from the geometric point of view , the presence of the 1-form ( [ eq : contactform ] ) is equivalent to the choice of a vector field with the same coefficients as @xmath35 with respect to the canonical basis @xmath36 , that is its dual vector ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gaborform ] ) : @xmath37 the kernel of @xmath35 , denoted @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) is the space of vectors orthogonal to @xmath40 .",
    "a basis of this space is constituted of the so - called horizontal or admissible vectors @xmath41 so that @xmath42 that defines the _ horizontal tangent space_. in particular we nota that the euclidean metric on the horizontal planes makes the vector fields @xmath43 orthogonal .",
    "the only manifolds ( curves or surfaces ) admissible in this space are the ones whose tangent vectors are linear combinations of the horizontal vectors ( [ eq : vectorfields ] ) .",
    "the neural connectivity between the receptive fields at different points in the @xmath12 space will be defined in terms of these vectors in section [ sec : diffusion ] .",
    "for reader convenience we compute here explicitly all the non - zero commutation relations between the vector fields : we can associate a directional derivative @xmath44 with the same coefficients .",

    "it is important to note that , even though the commutator is expressed formally as a second derivative , it is indeed a first derivative , so that it has an associated vector .",

    "it is worth noting that in this setting , the propagation is permitted only along the horizontal planes , while it is forbidden in their orthogonal direction @xmath40 .",

    "hence @xmath60 together with their commutators span the whole space at every point .",

    "@xcite since @xmath61 is never zero being the volume form of the space .",
    "we also note that we can define on @xmath12 a smooth composition law @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a counterclockwise rotation of an angle @xmath34 , that is such that the vector fields @xmath64 are left invariant with respect to this law .",
    "this implies that also the admissible curves of the structrue and its kernels will be invariant .",
    "the manifold @xmath12 together with this composition law can also be identified with a subset of the galilei group ( see appendix ) .",
    "the output of the gabor filters selects a set of points in @xmath12 corresponding to specific features of the image .",
    "since the gabor filters are always connected in terms of the vectors ( [ eq : vectorfields ] ) , also their output will inherit this structure , and will be concentrated around an admissible surface .",
    "the energy output of a cell with receptive profile @xmath65 in presence of a spatio - temporal stimulus @xmath2 is given by @xmath66    we note that taking the square modulus in ( [ eq : filtering ] ) disregards the phase of the corresponding linear filtering , which for many applications ( see e.g. @xcite ) is crucial .",
    "in this case however all the relevant information is encoded in this energy model .",
    "in particular the geometric quantities @xmath34 and @xmath9 are encoded in the points of maxima of the energy . to see why , we recall that the analogous of formula ( [ eq : filtering ] ) with purely spatial gabor filters was studied in @xcite , where the filtering output @xmath67 was a function of the variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 alone ( see also @xcite ) . in order to outline the goemetric meaning of the lifting",

    ", the output @xmath67 to a stimulus @xmath68 takes its maximum around a value @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 identifies the orientation orthogonal to the level lines of @xmath68 .",
    "as a consequence , in @xcite it is proved that the level lines of @xmath72 are lifted to curves admissible in the sense that their tangent vector lies in the kernel of the form @xmath73 which is a contact form that can be obtained by restricting ( [ eq : contactform ] ) to the space @xmath74 .",
    "since here we take into account time , then the output @xmath75 is a function defined on @xmath12 . in perfect analogy with the lower dimensional case , and denoting with @xmath76 a level set of the stimulus @xmath2 , the output @xmath75 takes its maximum around the values @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xmath79 such that the vector @xmath80 is orthogonal to the level set of @xmath81 .",

    "the surface @xmath84 is the 5d lifting of the level set of @xmath81 , and the orthogonality condition implies that it is admissible , in the sense that its tangent vectors lie in the horizontal space , kernel of the form @xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lslifting ] ) .",
    "this shows that such level sets of @xmath81 define a contact structure on the manifold , so the study of such geometric features induces to endow @xmath12 with the corresponding constraint on the tangent bundle that can be equivalently interpreted as a sub - riemannian constraint @xcite .",

    "the lifted points of the spatio - temporal stimulus are connected by admissible integral curves .",
    "however we will see that not all admissible curves can be considered lifted ones , and we will describe which ones have this property . these curves will represent the association fields in space - time , analogously to the association fields of field hayes and hess@xcite in the pure spatial case , and are reminiscent of the classical gestalt concept of _ good continuation_. we will discuss in section [ sec : truelife ] the compatibility of this structure with the cortical functional architecture . a probabilistic version of the connectivity field will be provided on the basis of fokker planck equations first introduced by d. mumford in the spatial case @xcite , and interpreted as model of connectivity in lie groups in several works such as @xcite . here",
    "we will extend this stochastic approach to the space - time contact structure .",
    "we have already seen that the output of rp filtering is concentrated around admissible submanifolds .",

    "the first one is described by integral curves of the vector @xmath100 and of the generators of the engrafted variables @xmath101 and @xmath102 : @xmath103 these curves lie in the section of the contact structure depicted in figure [ fig : contactform]a , where @xmath104 represents euclidean curvature and @xmath105 is the rate of change of local velocity along the curve . on the other hand ,",

    "these are generated by the integral curves ( [ eq : contour ] ) so to satisfy the system of equations @xmath109 with variable coefficients @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "in particular , due to condition ( [ eq : commutglue ] ) the set of points reacheable by piecewise constant integral curves of this type ( for an explicit expression see e.g. @xcite ) starting from a fixed point @xmath110 is the space @xmath111 where @xmath112 is fixed , so the space @xmath113 can be identified with the space of points @xmath114 .",

    "the curves ( [ eq : integralcurvesv ] ) and ( [ eq : associationt ] ) can be related to well - defined perceptual mechanisms .",
    "more precisely , we propose to consider them as association fields , in the sense of @xcite , devoted to the integration of contour in motion and trajectories .",
    "the perceptual tasks of subjective boundary completion and motion integration have been widely studied by both psychologists and physiologists , and their underlying physiological explanation continues to be an open issue of discussion .",
    "the perceptual bias towards collinear stimuli has classically been associated to the long - range horizontal connections linking cells in v1 sharing similar preferences in stimulus orientation .",
    "this specialized form of intra - striate connectivity pattern is found across many species , including cats , tree shrews and macaques @xcite , the main difference being the specificity and the spatial extent of the connections .",
    "furthermore , axons seem to follow the retinotopic cortical map anisotropically , with the axis of anisotropy being related to the orientation tuning of the originating cell @xcite .",
    "these connections have already been modeled in @xcite by means of a sub - riemannian diffusion process over the orientation space @xmath0 .    similarly to what happens for the integration of merely spatial visual information ,",
    "the brain is also capable to easily predict stimulus trajectories @xcite , and to group together boundary elements sharing similar motion or apparent motion paths @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for these effects could be the existence of specialized facilitatory networks linking cells anisotropically and coherently with their preference in velocity and axis of motion direction . supporting these assumptions",
    ", it has been found that the neural preferences in direction of movement are also structurally mapped in the cortical surface , with nearby neurons being tuned for similar motion direction @xcite , and it has been shown that excitatory horizontal connections in the v1 of the ferret are strictly iso - direction tuned @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is known that also extra - striate area mt / v5 is retinotopically organized , its horizontal connectivity pattern being highly structured , with connections reaching columns of cells tuned for similar orientation and direction preference anisotropically and asymmetrically @xcite . moreover , striate and extra - striate cortical areas seem to cooperate , and surround modulation in v1 can be given by the connectivity patterns implemented in both areas by means of fast feedforward and feedback inter - areal projections @xcite .",
    "regarding the physiological correlates of motion integration , it was shown that the motion of an occluded object trajectory is significantly represented in the human brain by the same visual areas that process real motion @xcite . moreover , a recent study based on electrophysiological recordings of the v1 of tree shrews showed some non - linear neural behaviors that are coherent with the phenomenological dynamics of motion integration @xcite .",
    "it is indeed a general assumption that some cortical area in the visual cortex is responsible for predicting future motion , a possible implementation being a specialized connectivity for spatio - temporal trajectory facilitation , that is different from the one in v1 responsible for contour integration @xcite .    here , we do not speculate on the exact physiological origin of these psychophysiological findings .",
    "however , we want to show that the connectivity kernels @xmath176 and @xmath177 arising from the geometry defined in section [ sec : geometry ] is capable to reproduce qualitatively some of the effects reported on the works that have been previously cited . we will embed this connectivity in the neural population activity model described in the next paragraph .",
    "then , in section [ sec : numerical ] we will simulate the response of cortical visual neurons to artificial stimuli , comparing the results with some psychophysiological findings reported in the recent literature .      the state of a population of cells can be characterized by a real - valued activity variable , which depends on the interaction of the feedforward input at different points , due to the cortical connectivity .",
    "the first population activity models are due to wilson and cowan @xcite , and ermentrout and cowan @xcite : @xmath178 where @xmath108 is the neural activity of the population , @xmath75 is the feedforward input ( [ eq : filtering ] ) , @xmath179 is the facilitation kernel , @xmath180 is the facilitation strength and @xmath181 is the sigmoidal function @xmath182 in the stationary case a first order approximation of the solution of ( [ ec ] ) is @xmath183 that is the activity formula that we will use in the experiments of section [ sec : numerical ] .",

    "the geometry of the functional architectures is contained in the kernel @xmath179 , taking into account the deep structures of the connectivity space .",
    "then the overall probability of activation can be obtained by convolution of the activity with the kernel @xmath179 , and the term @xmath185 is the facilitation pattern resulting from the contribution of horizontal cortico - cortical or feedback inter - areal connectivities .",
    "we note that , since the lebesgue measure @xmath186 on @xmath12 is left invariant with respect to the composition law ( [ eq : composition ] ) , and due to the symmetry ( [ eq : symmetry ] ) , then ( [ eq : cc ] ) has the structure of a convolution .    in the model of ermentrout - cowan only position and orientation",
    "were considered and symmetry properties were imposed to the facilitation patterns . in @xcite , for the same features it was proposed to choose as a kernel @xmath179 the fundamental solution of a fokker planck equation deduced from the euclidean symmetries . in the next section , two numerical simulations will be performed using equation ( [ giac ] ) . in the first one , we will model the propagation of boundaries in motion using the connectivity kernel ( [ eq : densityg0 ] ) . in the second experiment we will model instead the propagation of trajectories , using the 5d kernel ( [ eq : fpg0 ] ) .",
    "in this section some numerical simulations will be performed to test the reliability of the kernels computed in section [ sec : diffusion ] when introduced in the activity model ( [ giac ] ) and the results will be compared to some psychophysical and physiological experiments .",
    "for the subsequent numerical simulations , we measured in every discrete point @xmath187 of a stimulus @xmath81 of size @xmath188 , its local energy of orientation and speed by convolving the input image sequence with a pre - determined bank of gabor filters of fixed spatial frequency centered at the points @xmath189 , thus discretizing eq .",

    "the gabor scale parameters will follow the relations @xmath200 whose meaning is to approximately have @xmath201 spatial subregions under the gabor gaussian envelope , and a variable @xmath199 that allows the filter with maximum velocity to cover one wavelength within the gabor active time interval ( see @xcite for the physiological justifications ) .    the thresholded feedforward input @xmath202 is then computed following eq .",

    "to which we set the parameters @xmath203 and @xmath204 in the above stated formulas will be explicitly specified .",
    "it is worth noting that these parameters are not due to physiological data , due to the difficulty in finding some reference in the literature , but are chosen as to have a computationally reasonable number of non - null measurements @xmath202 .",
    "for the first simulation we use a dashed circle in linear motion moving upwards within the visual space .",
    "the image size is @xmath205 pixels and the image sequence is composed of @xmath206 frames .",
    "the circle segments are approximately @xmath207 pixels wide and the circle is moving with a uniform speed of @xmath208 pixels per frame ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rainstim ] ) . to get a measurement of local spatio - temporal features , we convolve the stimulus with a set of 3-dimensional gabor functions with ( [ eq : filtering ] ) .",
    "the spatial frequency parameter is set to @xmath209 , so that the gabor moving subregions match the width of the segments .",
    "the maximum local velocity represented in the filter set is @xmath210 pixel per frame , while spatial and temporal scale parameters are calculated accordingly with ( [ eq : gabscales ] ) . after having convolved the stimulus with the gabors , we model the neural extra - cellular activity by using ( [ eq : v1thresholding ] ) with parameters @xmath211 , @xmath212 , obtaining @xmath202 .",
    "we select the 4-dimensional subset corresponding to the @xmath213nd frame @xmath214 , where @xmath215 , thus neglecting behaviors over time .",
    "this is because the model given by the stochastic model of connectivity distribution @xmath176 is stationary , even if it is relying on spatio - temporal information , and is compatible with the dimensionality of @xmath113 in ( [ enne ] ) .",
    "following the assumptions that the measurements @xmath216 can model the output of a cortical direction- and speed - selective cell ( or of a neural population that are selective to the same visual features ) , the overall continuation probability can be obtained with a discretized version of the cortico - cortical facilitation pattern ( [ eq : cc ] ) with the kernel @xmath176 : @xmath217 where @xmath218 is calculated for every fiber vector @xmath219 on the same discretized domain @xmath113 of the lifted stimulus , using the stochastic approach described in section [ sec : stochasticx2x4x5 ] .",
    "the structure of ( [ eq : gconv_v ] ) is that of a discrete version of a group convolution with respect to the composition law ( [ eq : compositionv ] ) , due to the symmetry ( [ eq : symmetryv ] ) of the kernel and the left invariance of the lebesgue measure on @xmath113 .",
    "it is worth noting that the parameters @xmath220 and @xmath221 governing the diffusion process are related to the maximum spatio - temporal curvature of an illusory contour . due to the lack of reference physiological data ,",
    "the values for the diffusion coefficients were chosen in such a way that at the final value taken by the evolution parameter of the stochastic paths , the mean square displacements of the fiber variables @xmath222 are @xmath223 , that means @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "finally , the population activity is computed by @xmath226 that is a discretized version of ( [ giac ] ) where @xmath180 is a coefficient governing the total strength of the excitatory connections . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rainsym ] are shown the results of the simulation . in the top row",
    "we have plotted a iso - level surface of the normalized and thresholded output measurements @xmath227 .",

    "the iso - level surface of the global cortical activity @xmath228 is shown .",
    "note that continuation is performed within the whole manifold @xmath113 , propagating the local speed and direction cues at the end of the segments , and interpolating the data to define a 4-dimensional set that carries information even in the visual space between the segments , where no changes in contrast were originally present in the stimulus .",
    "these results are coherent with recent psychophysiological findings , where it is stated that a global shape in motion is better perceived if local velocity changes smoothly along its contour @xcite , and that the integration of the motion of a partially occluded object is facilitated when its visible contours define closed configurations @xcite .",
    "the stimuli that we will use in this simulation will be several instances of an object in motion along a certain direction , that disappears at a given time position @xmath229 , and reappears at @xmath230 with a direction of motion changed by @xmath231 in a position that is coherent to a piecewise continuous trajectory ( fig .",
    "[ fig : trajstim ] ) .",
    "it is a well documented fact that humans tend to perceive the two trajectories as pertaining to a single unit just for small values of @xmath232 and @xmath231 , an effect that is commonly referred to as motion integration . in particular , we know from many psychophysiological experiments that the chances of detecting a straight or curvilinear trajectory in noise increase with stimulus duration and with direction coherence @xcite .",
    "to do so , we created multiple instances from the stimulus paradigm described above , and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajstim ] , assigning different values to the parameters @xmath233 and @xmath231 .",
    "it is worth noting that we are using an elongated object whose axis of motion is always orthogonal to its major axis of eccentricity .",
    "the choice of this particular stimulus is naturally explained by the geometry , as the points @xmath234 that are connected by its continuation property implicitly define a local orientation and a direction of motion that is orthogonal to that orientation .",
    "the gabor filtering of a different kind of stimulus ( for example a moving dot ) would indeed measure high responses also for those velocity projections that are coherent with the real axis of motion , due to the motion streak effect @xcite , requiring a different neural model to detect unambiguously the direction of motion .",
    "thus , even if the majority of the psychophysiological experiments use moving dots as stimuli , the validity of the following experiment is not influenced , as exploring the exact physiological implementation of motion integration is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "the image sequences to process are @xmath235 pixels wide and are composed of @xmath236 frames .",
    "the value of eccentricity of the moving ellipsoidal object is set to @xmath207 , and its velocity is set to @xmath208 pixels per frame . each stimulus instance is uniquely identified by the couple @xmath237 .",
    "we convolve each sequence with a set of gabor filters with @xmath238 and @xmath239 set to match width of the object s minor axis , and again , we threshold the output according to ( [ eq : v1thresholding ] ) using parameters @xmath240 , @xmath241 , obtaining the set of measurements @xmath202 . in the previous simulation",
    "we have taken a temporal slice of this output , and then we have propagated the activity using the connectivity kernel @xmath176 .",
    "similarly , here we will propagate the activity present in @xmath202 , but without discarding time .",
    "the corresponding facilitation pattern @xmath242 is then obtained convolving it with the 5-dimensional kernel @xmath177 defined on the same discrete domain @xmath12 of the lifted stimulus using the same approach that led to ( [ eq : gconv_v ] ) @xmath243 and the total population activity @xmath244 is computed following ( [ eq : weigh_fac ] ) with @xmath245 . since this is a discretization of ( [ eq : cc ] ) , again we are considering a convolution - type operator .",
    "the results obtained by processing two stimulus configurations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajsym_xyt ] , where only the central portion of the full temporal domain is plotted , to highlight the different effects that activity propagation has in the two cases .",
    "when the change in direction of motion of the object is under a certain threshold , the trajectory is completed smoothly , yielding a strong activation in the temporal interval when the object is not present in the scene .",
    "if the value of @xmath231 increases , however , the spatio - temporal curvature of the optimal subjective trajectory progressively becomes too high to be completed by the connectivity , even if a weak response linking the two parts of the stimulus could yet be present .",
    "it is worth noting that due to the thresholding stage , this subjective interpolation effect is strongly non - linear , as it can not be explained by the sum of the responses to the first ( @xmath246 ) and second ( @xmath247 ) part of the stimulus alone ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : trajsym_fac ] ) .",
    "this is coherent with the findings in the work of wu et al , where electrophysiological experiments recorded a similar non - linear behavior of trajectory interpolation for small values of @xmath231 @xcite . in that work",

    "even if the stimulus paradigms are slightly different ( they use a field of moving dots with a null value of @xmath233 ) , the result of our simulations allow us to make some speculations",

    "the visualization of the output @xmath254 highlights the role that a trajectory - specialized cortical connectivity could have in performing tasks of motion integration .",
    "the spatio - temporal extension of @xmath254 over @xmath12 gets smaller for higher values of @xmath233 and @xmath231 .",
    "the decay of the facilitation effect is coherent with the observations made in @xcite ( where @xmath255 ) and @xcite ( where @xmath256 ) , even if the experiments are methodologically different .",
    "moreover , even if , coherently with our results , some psychophysiological experiments showed that a broken trajectory in noise is easily detectable @xcite , as far as we know little has been done to explore the effect of changing the duration @xmath233 of the temporal occluding gap .      regarding the implementation of our model",
    ", we would like to highlight functional meaning of the parameter couple @xmath257 , driving the diffusion along the fiber variables @xmath258 when calculating the kernels @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "in particular , the parameter @xmath220 seems to be strongly related to the maximum perceived curvature of illusory contours and trajectories , while @xmath221 sets the maximum rate of change of local velocity along admissible subjective contours ( trajectories ) . it would be interesting to try to fine - tune the parameters of the model in order to reproduce quantitatively as precisely as possible the psychophysiological findings found in literature .",
    "we aim to carry out this analysis in a future paper .",
    "it is worth noting that the physiological correlates of the first simulation are not well documented and , as far as we know , no one has yet studied the neural activity in cortical regions responding to subjective contours in motion .",
    "we suppose that it would be a difficult issue to address , as multiple cortical layers , as v1 , v4 and mt / v5 , may be involved @xcite . recently",
    ", some significative results have been obtained with static illusory contours , using promising electrophysiological techniques @xcite .",
    "those kinds of experiments , targeted to the detection of illusory motion contours , could give additional clues about the neural computation that governs the influence of spatio - temporal features in the detection of moving shapes and boundaries .    as discussed in the beginning of section [ sec : truelife ] , a possible physiological implementation of the geometry used in the second numerical simulation , could be a trajectory - specialized cortico - cortical connectivity between neurons in the higher visual areas",
    ". the advantages of having such an excitatory connectivity implemented in the visual cortex could be very important in performing complex cognitive tasks .",
    "for example , we assume that the brain could use the improvements in contour detection with respect to the only @xmath120 related functional architecture , due to an additional information , that of velocity , that indeed in practical situation is a feature that is coherent on objects .",

    "the non - linear effect of the facilitating kernel @xmath177 remains appreciable just for small values of @xmath233 and @xmath231 , rapidly decaying as the value of the characteristic stimulus parameters increases . ]",
    "in this paper we proposed a model of cortical functional architecture for the processing of spatio - temporal visual information .",
    "motion features are detected first by simple and complex cells with rp modelled by 2d+time gabor filters .",
    "linear filtering with such a profiles lifts the visual stimulus from the base space @xmath259 to the phase space @xmath260 comprising spatial and temporal frequencies , in which a liouville form can be defined .",
    "we defined a 5d phase space with fixed frequency by taking a reduction of the previous differential form .",
    "then , exploiting the commutation properties of the horizontal basis , we regarded the tangent space of the contact manifold @xmath12 as a possible constraint acting on the connectivity between points , giving the definition of admissible integral , or horizontal , curves .",
    "possible linear combinations of the horizontal basis that are compatible with the definition of admissible curve have been studied , in order to model the possible lifting of the visual stimuli as association fields , in the sense of @xcite .",
    "we considered the corresponding deterministic integral curves for two modeling limit cases : contours in motion and trajectories of a point in motion .",
    "then we considered horizontal stochastic paths , i.e. trajectories of points that always move along the tangent space of @xmath12 and are allowed to change the value associated to the fiber variables @xmath222 in a random , equidistributed way .",
    "we have seen that the resulting integrations over the evolution parameter of the paths coincide with the kernels of the fokker planck operators defined on the geometries .",
    "both deterministic curves and stochastic kernels inherit the symmetries of the non associative reduced galilean group as described in appendix .",
    "after a discussion about the compatibility of our theoretical framework with various phenomenological and psychophysiological findings on visual perception and cognition reported in the literature , we introduced the stochastic kernels as facilitation inducers in a neural population activity model .",
    "suitable numerical simulations have been carried out , by processing pre - determined artificial stimuli with the neural population activity model previously described , showing that the fokker planck stochastic kernels endow the model with the capability of completion and continuation of contours in motion and trajectories of points , coherently with the phenomenological experiments of rainville @xcite and wu et al @xcite .",
    "+ in conclusion , results have shown that the proposed functional geometry is compatible with existing psychophysical and physiological experiments , even if a complete knowledge about the effective neural implementation needs supplementary empirical data .",
