    "narratives have been a focus on study from several perspectives , most prominently from the viewpoint of language , literature , and computational linguistics ; see for instance , discourse analysis and computational narratology @xcite . from the viewpoint of commonsense reasoning , and closely related to the computational models of narrative perspective ,",

    "`` _ _ a narrative tells what happened , but any narrative can only tell a certain amount",
    ". a narrative will usually give facts about the future of a situation that are not just consequences of projection from an initial situation _",
    "the interpretation of narrative knowledge in this paper is based on these characterisations , especially in regard to the commonsense representation and reasoning tasks that accrue whilst modelling and reasoning about the perceptually grounded , narrativised epistemic state of an autonomous agent pertaining to _ space , actions , events , and change _ @xcite . in particular , this encompasses a range of inference patterns such as : ( a ) spatio - temporal abduction for scenario and narrative completion @xcite ; ( b ) integrated inductive - abductive reasoning with narrative knowledge @xcite ; ( c ) narrative - based postdiction for abnormality detection and planning @xcite .",
    "* perceptual narratives*.these are declarative models of visual , auditory , haptic and other observations in the real world that are obtained via artificial sensors and / or human input .",
    "declarative models of perceptual narratives can be used for interpretation and control tasks in the course of assistive technologies in everyday life and work scenarios , e.g. , behaviour interpretation , robotic plan generation , semantic model generation from video , ambient intelligence and smart environments ( e.g. , see narrative based models in @xcite ) .    *",

    "domain in listing 1 . in this domain , _ perceptual narratives _ as in fig . 1 are generated based on perceived spatial change interpreted as interactions of humans in the environment .",
    "such narratives explaining the ongoing activities are needed to anticipate changes in the environment , as well as to appropriately influence the real - time control of the camera system . to convey the meaning of the presentation and the speakers interactions with a projection , the camera has to capture the scene including the speakers gestures , slides , and the audience .",
    "e.g. , in fig .",
    "1 , when the speaker explains the slides , the camera has to capture the speaker and the corresponding information on the slides . to this end ,",
    "the camera records an overview shot capturing the speaker and the projection , and zooms on the particular element when the speaker explains it in detail , to allow the viewer to follow the presentation and to get the necessary information .",
    "when the speaker continues the talk , the camera focuses on the speaker to omit unnecessary and distracting information . to capture reactions of the audience , e.g. comments , questions or applause",
    ", the camera records an overview of the attending people or close - up shots of the commenting or asking person .",
    "systems that monitor and interact with an environment populated by humans and other artefacts require a formal means for representing and reasoning about spatio - temporal , event and action based phenomena that are grounded to real public and private scenarios ( e.g. , logistical processes , activities of everyday living ) of the environment being modelled .",
    "a fundamental requirement within such application domains is the representation of _ dynamic _ knowledge pertaining to the spatial aspects of the environment within which an agent , system , or robot is functional .",
    "this translates to the need to explicitly represent and reason about dynamic spatial configurations or scenes and , for real world problems , integrated reasoning about perceptual narratives of _ space , actions , and change _ @xcite . with these modelling primitives ,",
    "the ability to perform _ predictive _ and _ explanatory _ analyses on the basis of sensory data is crucial for creating a useful intelligent function within such environments @xcite .      to understand the nature of perceptual narratives ( of space , and motion ) , consider the aforediscussed work - in - progress domain of _ smart meeting cinematography _",

    "the particular infrastructural setup for the example presented herein consists of pan - tilt - zoom ( ptz ) capable cameras , depth sensors ( kinect ) , and a low - level vision module for people tracking ( whole body , hand gesture , movement ) customised on the basis of open - source algorithms and software . with respect to this setup , declaratively grounded perceptual narratives capturing the information in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotunde - activities ] is developed on the basis of a commonsense theory of _ qualitative space _",

    "in particular , the overall model as depicted in fig .",
    "[ pn ] consists of : _ space and motion _ : a theory to declaratively reason about qualitative spatial relations ( e.g. , topology , orientation ) , and qualitative motion perceived in the environment and interpret changes as domain dependent observations in the context of everyday activities involving humans and artefacts",

    "_ semantic characterisation _ : as a result of the aforementioned , real - time generation of declarative narratives of perceptual data ( e.g. , rgb - d ) obtained directly from people / object tracking algorithms .",
