    "cometary  regions also resemble bowshocks , due either to density gradients in the ambient gas or to motion of the ionizing source with respect to the interstellar surroundings @xcite . both the direction of a bowshock and its `` standoff distance '' from the star generating the wind are determined by the velocity of the star with respect to the surrounding medium . in the case of runaway o stars ,",

    "highly luminous and windy stars dominate the dynamics of their local ism .",
    "we do not observe ir bowshocks around any of the earliest - type stars in either rcw49 or m17 , because they have blown large , evacuated cavities in the centers of the regions .",
    "little or no ambient material remains close to the stars to produce a bowshock .",
    "apart from the wolf - rayet systems , one of the earliest stars in rcw49 is g284.2642 - 00.3156 . using optical spectroscopy ,",
    "@xcite classified this star as o4 v(f ) and derived a spectrophotometric distance of @xmath50 kpc .",

    "doubling the luminosity moves the spectrophotometric distance from 3.2 to 4.5 kpc , in agreement with a distance of 4.2 kpc but inconsistent with 6 kpc .",
    "the standoff distance @xmath51 of a bowshock from its driving star is the point where the momentum flux of the stellar wind balances the momentum flux of the ambient medium : @xmath52 .",
    "following @xcite , we normalize the stellar wind mass loss rate , @xmath53 m@xmath54 yr@xmath55 , stellar wind velocity @xmath56 cm s@xmath55 , ambient hydrogen particle density of @xmath57 @xmath58 , and use a mean ism gas mass per hydrogen atom @xmath59 g. assuming a spherically symmetric stellar wind with a mass - loss rate given by @xmath60 , the velocity of the star with respect to the ambient ism can be written as @xmath61,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the terminal velocity of the stellar wind",

    "the distance from each bowshock to the likely source of the large - scale ism flow , measured on the sky as @xmath70 , are also presented for reference in table 3 .",
    "the mass - loss rates and stellar wind velocities in equation 1 suffer from high dispersion as a function of spectral type @xcite , a factor of 2 or even greater , and this is compounded by a comparable level of uncertainty in the spectral types .",
    "the uncertainty on our measurements of @xmath51 ranges from @xmath71 for the largest bowshocks ( m17-s2 and rcw49-s1 ) to @xmath72 for the smaller bowshocks that are barely resolved by irac .",
    "we estimate that @xmath73 is uncertain by a factor of 2 in m17 and up to a factor of 3 in rcw49 , where the spectral types of the driving stars are less constrained .",
    "these uncertainties , reflected in the range of values for @xmath73 in table 3 , are dominated by the uncertainty in the stellar wind properties .",
    "we have neglected the effects of turbulent pressure in our calculation of the momentum flux balance of the bowshocks .",
    "this is a potentially significant contributor to the total ism pressure held off by the bowshocks .",
    "the effect of turbulent pressure would be to systematically decrease the standoff distance @xmath51 , causing us to overestimate @xmath74 .",
    "in reality , for the fast winds of early - type stars , the observed bowshock is displaced from the standoff distance by a significant amount .",
    "this happens because the cooling timescale of the shocked stellar wind is very long .",
    "the result is a thick layer of hot gas intervening between the wind terminal shock at the standoff distance and the thin , dense layer of interstellar gas and dust forming the observed bowshock .",
    "the numerical simulations of @xcite predict that the bowshock should be located at twice the standoff distance from the driving star . in this case ,",
    "our derived values of @xmath73 in table 3 would be underestimated by the same factor of 2 .",
    "this systematic correction is comparable to the intrinsic uncertainties in our estimates of @xmath73 , and it partially compensates for the effects of neglecting turbulent pressure in the ambient ism .",
    "therefore , the assumption that the observed distance of the bowshocks from the driving stars corresponds to the standoff distance @xmath51 should not have a large impact on our results , and we find that the cautious application of equation 1 yields reasonable results .",
    "orbital velocities of o stars in massive clusters are typically @xmath75 .",
    "the expansion speed of ionized gas in  regions is generally comparable to the sound speed of @xmath76 , and this appears to be true in m17 @xcite .",
    "most of the bowshocks ( the exception being rcw49-s1 ) are apparently located within the ionized gas of the radio  regions .",
    "the likely explanation for the bowshock emission in the ir is that dust in the  regions @xcite is swept - up by the bowshocks .",
    "the observed average electron density in the northern bar of the m17  region is @xmath77 @xmath58 @xcite , so the values of @xmath78 listed in table 3 are likely to be close to the actual relative velocities of the stars and the ism for most of the bowshocks .",
    "the values of @xmath63 calculated for m17-s1 and -s2 are in good agreement .",
    "m17-s3 , however , presents a different picture .",
    "m17-s3 appears to be associated with a `` teardrop '' structure ( figure 1 ) in the photodissociation region ( pdr ) , near the ionization front .",
    "the ambient density surrounding this star could be significantly higher than the density within the  region .",
    "if @xmath74 for this bowshock is comparable to that of the other 2 bowshocks in m17 , then @xmath79 @xmath58 in this location",
    ". this value agrees with the measurements of electron density in the dense clumps of ionized gas in m17 @xcite .",
    "the unusual morphology of the diffuse ir emission associated with m17-s3 suggests that the star may have recently emerged from an evaporating globule on the edge of the pdr ; a larger , more evolved analog of the nearby pillar structure seen in figure 1 .    in rcw49 , all 3 bowshocks are found in very different locations , but we note that 2 of the bowshocks appear to be similar in size , color , and ambient environment ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the largest bowshock , rcw49-s1 , is different , since it is located relatively far ( 16.2 pc at 4.2 kpc ) from westerlund 2 , outside the  region .",
    "the presence of rcw49-s1 , along with its orientation , indicates that rcw49 vents a large - scale flow of gas through the cavity opening to the west .",
    "this flow likely originates in the combined winds of the westerlund 2 cluster and thus should be much more diffuse than the  region gas @xcite . assuming a density of 1 @xmath58 in the flow from westerlund 2 , the standoff distance of rcw49-s1 at 4.2 kpc gives a flow velocity of @xmath80 .",
    "such a high value of @xmath74 is reasonable , given that the gas must move supersonically relative to the star to produce a shock , and the sound speed in the hot , rarefied gas of the flow streaming away from the  region is @xmath81 .    because rcw49-s1 was detected by _ msx _ and _ iras _ in addition to glimpse , we can construct the sed of the bowshock from 4.5 @xmath4 m  to 100 @xmath4 m  ( table 2 ) .",
    "we computed sed models of rcw49-s1 using a 3-d radiative equilibrium code @xcite modified to include very small grain ( vsg ) and pah emission @xcite .",
    "we used the canonical mass fraction for vsg / pah grains of 5% @xcite .",
    "we modeled the bowshock geometry as a paraboloid with the apex offset by @xmath82 pc from the o6 v star ( assuming @xmath66 and the 4.2 kpc distance ) . for models that reproduced the observed images , the sed shape was insensitive both to the thickness of the shock and to the radial density profile of the dust ( with the total mass scaled to match the observed sed ) .",
    "the black line in figure [ model ] shows the sed for a model with a density varying as @xmath83 from the 0.16 pc standoff distance out to a radius of 1.5 pc .",
    "the observed sed shortward of 30 @xmath4 m  is well - matched by the model . for radial density exponents from @xmath84 to 0 , the mass of this material ranges from @xmath85 m@xmath86 to 2 m@xmath86 , respectively , assuming a dust - to - gas mass ratio of 0.01 .",
    "the optical depth in all models is low , with @xmath87 within 1 pc . to match the _ iras _ data at 60 and 100 @xmath4 m  requires low - density material farther from the star .",
    "the _ green _ line in figure [ model ] is a model including a shell 23 pc from the star .",
    "this material added mid - ir pah emission , so we lowered the vsg / pah mass fraction to 3% to continue to match the mid - ir sed , and the image still matches the data well .",
    "the @xmath88 through the bowshock in this model is 0.25 , most of it due to the outer shell . along the line of sight to the star , @xmath89 , so the bowshock and shell contribute a negligible fraction of the interstellar extinction .",
    "these models show that dust distributed in a bowshock geometry matches both the images and the sed reasonably well .",
    "the ir emission from the bowshock can be explained by reprocessed stellar radiation without any additional dust heating by the shock .",
    "the structure of rcw - s1 is probably significantly different from that of the other 5 bowshocks in our sample , because it is located in a distinct interstellar environment . because of the high temperature and low density in the flow outside the  region , the shocked interstellar gas can not cool quickly enough to form a dense layer behind the bowshock , as likely happens in the other 5 cases .",
    "the shock is approximately adiabatic , remaining very hot and only moderately compressed ( by a factor of @xmath90 ) as it flows past the star , forming a relatively thick layer .",
    "hence , while rcw - s1 is the only bowshock in our sample observed at enough different mid - ir wavelengths to allow us to create a meaningful model of the emission , it may not be appropriate to draw strong conclusions about the remaining bowshocks based upon this model .",
    "we have observed 6 prominent ir bowshocks in m17 and rcw49 .",
    "these objects appear to be produced by the winds of individual o stars colliding with large - scale interstellar gas flows in the  regions .",
    "one bowshock , m17-s3 , may be the leading edge of an evaporating globule containing a newly - formed and previously undiscovered o star in the well - studied m17 region .",
    "all three bowshocks associated with rcw49 lead us to identify new candidate o stars . our stellar classifications also suggest that the true distance to rcw49 is less than the kinematic distance of 6 kpc .",
    "the bowshocks are bright at ir wavelengths due to emission from dust swept up from the ambient ism and heated by radiation from the bowshock driving stars . as @xcite note , ir excess emission from a bowshock could be attributed to the presence of a circumstellar disk , particularly when the bowshock morphology is not spatially well - resolved .",
    "this can be a pitfall for observational studies of accreting massive protostars .",
    "the collective winds of the most luminous stars in young , massive clusters produce overlapping large - scale flows that hollow out thermally hot cavities in the parent molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "the largest bowshock presented here , rcw49-s1 , is evidence that the combined winds of the ionizing stars in westerlund 2 have escaped the region , creating a flow of hot gas moving at a few @xmath0  that extends at least 16 pc away from rcw49 .",
    "the driving stars of the other 5 bowshocks are surrounded by ionized gas and dust of their natal regions , where the density of the ambient medium ( @xmath91 @xmath58 ) is sufficiently high to produce the observed bowshocks with a relative velocity of only 1020 .",
    "the winds of the bowshock driving stars do not directly encounter the @xmath92  winds from the most massive stars in the cluster .",
    "instead , the bowshocks are shaped by the expansion of the ionized gas in the  regions relative to the orbital motions of the stars .",
    "eventually , supernova explosions will produce high velocity shock waves that heat and disperse the original gas cloud . in star forming regions like m17 and rcw49 that have not yet been disrupted by supernovae , ir bowshocks serve as interstellar `` weather vanes , '' indicating the speed and direction of large - scale gas flows at points within and around giant  regions .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of six infrared stellar - wind bowshocks in the galactic massive star formation regions m17 and rcw49 from _ spitzer _ glimpse ( galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ) images . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared array camera ( irac ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _ clearly resolves the arc - shaped emission produced by the bowshocks . </S>",
    "<S> we combine _ two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) , _ _ spitzer , _ _ msx , _ and _ iras _ observations to obtain the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the bowshocks and their individual driving stars . </S>",
    "<S> we use the stellar seds to estimate the spectral types of the three newly - identified o stars in rcw49 and one previously undiscovered o star in m17 . </S>",
    "<S> one of the bowshocks in rcw49 reveals the presence of a large - scale flow of gas escaping the  region at a few @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> radiation - transfer modeling of the steep rise in the sed of this bowshock toward longer mid - infrared wavelengths indicates that the emission is coming principally from dust heated by the star driving the shock . </S>",
    "<S> the other 5 bowshocks occur where the stellar winds of o stars sweep up dust in the expanding  regions . </S>"
