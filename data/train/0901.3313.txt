    "the spin degrees of freedom have been usually neglected . in such a case",
    "one can only calculate the unpolarized cross sections which are mostly sensitive to the central part of the nucleon - nucleus optical potential .",
    "however , there exist experimental data for polarization observables that depend as well on the spin - orbit part of the optical potential .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the spin observables in @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions in the framework of exact three - body faddeev / alt , grassberger , and sandhas ( ags ) equations @xcite such that all discrepancies with the experimental data can be attributed solely to the shortcomings of the used optical potential models . a part of the reactions to be considered here",

    "thus , the comparison with the results of ref .  @xcite may allow us to draw some conclusions on the reliability of cdcc for calculating spin observables , in addition to the cross section benchmark @xcite .",

    "we describe @xmath0 and @xmath1 type reactions using three - body @xmath4 model .",
    "an exact treatment of the quantum three - body scattering problem is provided by both faddeev @xcite and ags equations @xcite that are equivalent to the schrdinger equation but are more suitable for the numerical solution due to the connectedness of the kernel .",
    "the faddeev equations are formulated for the components of the wave function while the ags equations , @xmath5 are a system of coupled integral equations for the transition operators @xmath6 whose on - shell matrix elements @xmath7 are scattering amplitudes and therefore lead directly to the observables . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uba ] ) @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the free resolvent , and @xmath10 is the two - particle transition matrix , @xmath11 being the available three - particle energy in the center of mass ( c.m . ) system , @xmath12 the free hamiltonian , and @xmath13 the potential for the pair @xmath14 in odd - man - out notation .",
    "the channel states @xmath15 for @xmath16 are the eigenstates of the corresponding channel hamiltonian @xmath17 with the energy eigenvalue @xmath11 ; thus , @xmath15 is a product of the bound state wave function for pair @xmath14 and a plane wave with fixed on - shell momentum corresponding to the relative motion of particle @xmath14 and pair @xmath14 in the initial or final state .",
    "observables of elastic scattering are calculated from the matrix elements with @xmath18 while @xmath19 corresponds to transfer reactions .",
    "we solve the ags equations using momentum - space partial - wave basis where they become a system of integral equations with two continuous variables , the values of jacobi momenta .",
    "the employed numerical techniques are described in great detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the ags equations are applicable only to short - range potentials @xmath13 .",
    "nevertheless , the long - range coulomb force between charged particles can be included in this framework using the method of screening and renormalization @xcite which enables to calculate the coulomb - distorted short - range part of the transition amplitude by solving the ags equations with nuclear plus screened coulomb potential ; the convergence of the results with the screening radius has to be established .",
    "the method has been successfully applied to proton - deuteron @xcite and @xmath20-deuteron @xcite elastic scattering and breakup , and to three - body nuclear reactions involving deuterons or one - neutron halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "the dynamic input to the ags equations are the potentials @xmath13 for the three pairs of particles . as the @xmath21 interaction",
    "we take realistic cd bonn potential @xcite , in contrast to the usual cdcc calculations where a simple gaussian @xmath21 potential is used . for the nucleon - nucleus @xmath22 interaction , in order to study the model dependence , we use several different optical potentials , namely , those by watson et al .",
    "@xcite , menet et al .",
    "@xcite , becchetti and greenlees @xcite , and koning and delaroche @xcite ; the corresponding predictions in the following will be abbreviated by w , m , bg , and kd , respectively . each of these potentials is fitted to the @xmath23 data in a limited mass and energy range ; those limitations are respected in the present calculations .",
    "the energy - dependent parameters of the potentials are taken at a half deuteron lab energy in the @xmath0 reactions and at the proton lab energy for @xmath24 in the @xmath1 reactions . in the latter case",
    "the @xmath25 potential is real and supports a number of bound states corresponding to the ground and excited single - particle states of the @xmath26 nucleus while all pauli forbidden states are removed ; the potential parameters and the resulting binding energies are given in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath27 and @xmath28 nuclei .",
    "the interaction within @xmath21 , @xmath25 , and @xmath24 pairs is included in partial waves with pair orbital angular momentum @xmath29 , 10 , and 20 , respectively , and the total angular momentum is @xmath30 ; depending on the reaction some of these quantum numbers cutoffs can be safely chosen significantly lower , leading , nevertheless , to well converged results .",
    "the @xmath24 channel is more demanding than the @xmath25 channel due to the screened coulomb force , where the screening radius @xmath31 to 10 fm for the short - range part of the scattering amplitude is sufficient for the convergence .",
    "the experimental data for the spin observables are scarcer than for the spin - averaged cross sections .",
    "nevertheless , a complete set of deuteron analyzing powers over a wide mass and angular range is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath32 mev ; other measurements exist as well but cover only rather narrow angular or mass range .",

    "both potentials fail to reproduce the vector analyzing power @xmath39 data at small angles @xmath40 deg ; the reason for this failure , at least to some extent , may be the inability to describe @xmath39 at small angles in @xmath41 elastic scattering as can be seen in ref .",

    "[ fig : dsicani ] .",

    "quite surprisingly , at larger angles @xmath48 deg the old global potential bg describes deuteron scattering from @xmath36 and @xmath37 nuclei better than the new and precise kd potential which has many more parameters fitted individually to the @xmath25 and @xmath24 data of the considered nuclei . at smaller angles all potentials",
    "account for the data with comparable quality except for @xmath39 where kd shows an additional sharp maximum instead of a minimum .",
    "the most serious discrepancies between theory and data take place in small - angle @xmath39 and in large - angle @xmath44 .",
    "while the latter one is similar as in the case of @xmath33 and @xmath34 nuclei , the former one is somehow different : the data are reproduced at very small angles , but then there is a narrow angular interval around @xmath49 deg where @xmath39 is strongly overpredicted .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath39 in proton scattering from heavier nuclei is well described by the employed potentials .",
    "thus , in this case the @xmath39 discrepancy even partially can not be explained by a poor @xmath23 data fit and must be due to another , presently unknown , reason .",
