    "the top quark has been discovered only recently @xcite due to its very large mass : @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the top quark is easily the heaviest particle in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this peculiar property brings several reasons to study it .",
    "first , the yukawa coupling of the top quark is nearly one which could be a sign that it plays a special role in the origin of mass beyond the standard model .",
    "second , radiative corrections due to top quark loops are often dominant in the prediction of precision observables like the @xmath0 or higgs boson mass .",
    "finally , its large mass implies it has a very short lifetime ( @xmath2s ) , about an order of magnitude smaller than the hadronization time , which provides a unique opportunity to study a bare quark .",
    "the top quarks are produced by the tevatron , a @xmath3 collider operating at a center - of - mass energy of 1.96 tev for the current period of data - taking ( run ii ) .",
    "they are produced predominantly in pairs ( @xmath4 ) via the strong interaction with a predicted cross - section of @xmath5 pb @xcite .",
    "because the @xmath6 ckm matrix element is nearly one under the 3 families sm assumption , the top quarks are predicted to decay @xmath7 99.8% of the time to a real @xmath0 boson and a @xmath8-quark . the two resulting @xmath0 bosons in turn decay either hadronically or leptonically , defining the three channels of @xmath4 events ( with branching ratios in parenthesis ) : `` all - hadronic '' for two hadronic decays ( 46% ) , `` lepton+jets '' for one leptonic and hadronic decays ( 29% ) and `` dilepton '' for two leptonic decays ( 5% ) . by `` leptons ''",
    "we refer only to electrons and muons , taus being generally too difficult to identify to be usually considered in top quark properties measurements .",
    "the @xmath4 events reconstruction are performed by the cdf and d  detectors that are described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "typical event selections include identification of isolated leptons with high transverse momentum ( @xmath9 ) , large transverse missing energy ( @xmath10 ) due to the undetected neutrino(s ) from @xmath0 boson decays , several high-@xmath9 jets and identification of @xmath8-jets  ( @xmath8-tagging ) generally using secondary vertex tagging .",
    "the integrated luminosity ( @xmath11 ) used for the measurements presented here vary from @xmath12  200350  pb@xmath13 .",
    "the current information on @xmath14 comes from measurements performed during run  i of the tevatron ( with a luminosity of @xmath12 100 pb@xmath13 ) .",
    "the world average is @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the final goal in run  ii is to collect between 4 - 8 fb@xmath13 and reduce the uncertainty on @xmath14 to @xmath12 @xmath16 .    a precise measurement of @xmath14 is strongly motivated in the sm because the radiative corrections to many precision observables are dominated by top quark loops .",
    "a famous example is the indirect constraint on the higgs boson mass ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the current constraint is @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "more detailed discussions on the precision electroweak observables can be found in these proceedings ( see contribution from p. renton ) .    before describing specific analyses ,",
    "we first discuss general considerations .",
    "one challenge of the @xmath14 measurement is to solve the combinatorics problem in the event reconstruction .",
    "for example there are four jets in the final state in the lepton+jets channel ( @xmath19 ) , resulting in 12 possible jet - parton assignments ( since the two @xmath0 daughter jets are interchangeable in the reconstruction ) .",
    "the problem is simplified by tagging @xmath8-jets  as described above .",
    "another limitation of the measurement is the large uncertainty in the modeling of the jet energy response , referred to as the jet energy scale uncertainty ( jes ) .",
    "this is generally the dominant systematic uncertainty , and is currently about @xmath20 for cdf and 5@xmath21 for d .",
    "cdf recently reported the most precise measurement of @xmath14 to date .",
    "it has been performed in the lepton+jets channel using @xmath11  = 318 pb@xmath13  of data .",
    "one novelty of this analysis is the usage of the hadronic @xmath0 boson decays ( @xmath22 ) to improve the jet energy scale uncertainty .",
    "templates of reconstructed top quark and @xmath0 boson mass are created in mc events as a function of the true top quark mass and the jet energy scale and compared with the data .",
    "the fit to the data yields @xmath23 where both the statistical and jes uncertainties are included .",
    "the systematic uncertainties not including the jes are small ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the final result is @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ f : fitconsistencymreco ] shows the reconstructed top quark mass in the data with the best fits from the mc templates overlaid .",
    "analyses using the template method in the lepton+jets channel have also been performed by the d  collaboration .",
    "the best measurement so far corresponds to a luminosity of 230 pb@xmath13  and yields @xmath26 .",
    "a different class of analyses uses a matrix - element method that consists of computing a probability for each event to be signal with a given top quark mass .",
    "the probability is computed using the full sm production and decay matrix - elements .",
    "this method has been shown to be very powerful statistically , as demonstrated by the best measurement in run i @xcite .",
    "the cdf collaboration has recently reported a measurement using this method : @xmath27 .",
    "the result is in very good agreement with the template analysis above .",
    "a similar measurement is expected to be released by the d  collaboration very soon .",
    "the top quark mass can also be measured in the dilepton channel but with larger statistical uncertainties due to the smaller branching ratio and the two neutrinos in the final state that complicate the event reconstruction .",
    "the cdf collaboration has recently reported the best measurement in this channel to date using the matrix - element method : @xmath28 ( 340 pb@xmath13 ) .",
    "the best measurement at d  so far is : @xmath29 ( 230 pb@xmath13 ) .",
    "it is very important to study in detail the properties of the top quark since it might be more closely related to new physics than other sm particles due to its large mass .",
    "for instance , one can study the polarization of the @xmath0 boson inside the top decays . in the sm , 70% , 30% and 0% of @xmath0 bosons",
    "are predicted to have a longitudinal , left - handed and right - handed helicity , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 helicity is sensitive to the angle between the charged lepton in @xmath0 rest frame and the @xmath8-jet  angle , denoted as @xmath30 .",
    "the d  collaboration measured the fraction of right - handed @xmath0 bosons in top decays : @xmath31 at 95% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "figure [ f_whel_d0 ] shows the distribution @xmath30 in data .",
    "the @xmath0 helicity is also sensitive to the charged lepton @xmath9 spectrum from @xmath0 boson decays that has been used at cdf to measure the fraction of longitudinal @xmath0 bosons : @xmath32 .",
    "the assumption that the top quark decays nearly 100% of the time to @xmath33 is checked by measuring @xmath34 .",
    "this is done by counting the number of @xmath8-tags in the sample .",
    "such a measurement was performed at d  and yielded @xmath35 at 95% c.l .. a consistent result has been obtained by cdf : @xmath36 at 95% c.l . @xcite .",
    "other properties of the top quark will be measured in run ii as more data is accumulated like the electric charge , @xmath4 spin correlation and rare decays .",
    "the precise determination of top quark properties is already well underway in run  ii at the tevatron .",
    "the best measurement of the top quark mass to date has been performed at cdf : @xmath25 .",
    "a very competitive measurement is expected to be released by d  very soon .",
    "measurements of other properties of top quarks show a good agreement with the sm using only the small @xmath4 samples collected so far ( @xmath37 events per experiment ) .",
    "we can expect these datasets to grow by a factor of ten or so by the end of run ii , which will greatly improve our knowledge of the peculiar particle that is the top quark .",
    "we note that there was no time to present all analyses of top quark properties performed at the tevatron .",
    "more details can be found on the public web pages of the cdf @xcite and d   @xcite experiments ."
