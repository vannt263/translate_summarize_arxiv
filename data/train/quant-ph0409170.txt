    "[ sec : approach ] .",
    "the first consideration is the choice of initial state .",
    "current nmr quantum computation begins with effective pure states , but we simply want to obtain an entangled state by any means . the thermal state is a better initial state for reasons we now explain .    one possible decomposition of an effective pure state is the following mixture of transformed thermal states : @xmath53 here @xmath35 is the dimension of @xmath31 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are cyclic permutation matrices .",

    "now entanglement is generally a convex function and therefore is reduced under convex combination .",

    "these considerations motivate us to focus on entangling nmr _ thermal states _ in this paper .    for convenience in the analysis",
    ", we assume that all spins in the nmr molecules have the same zeeman energy splitting and consider an isotropic hamiltonian @xmath58 expressed in the computational ( spin ) basis . here",
    "@xmath59 is the frequency corresponding to a spin with gyromagnetic ratio @xmath60 in a magnetic field of strength @xmath7 , @xmath61 is the pauli @xmath62 operator acting on the @xmath63th spin , and @xmath0 is the number of spin-1/2 particles in each molecule .",
    "we neglect the @xmath64-coupling interaction between neighboring spins as it is @xmath65 times smaller than the zeeman energy .",
    "the corresponding thermal state is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : thstate ] ) and the hamiltonian above .",

    ", there are several ways we can facilitate the creation of entangled thermal states :    * enhance initial polarization * increase the number of qubits ( spins ) per molecule * perform algorithmic cooling * find optimally entangling unitary operations .",
    "we expect that increased polarization will yield a thermal state that is more easily entangled . doing so moves the thermal state away from the maximally mixed state . increasing",
    "the number of qubits should have the same effect , but the intuition behind this conjecture is weaker . as we have seen , the bounds on the nonentanglability of @xmath31 relax as @xmath0 increases . moreover , the volume of separable states appears to decrease with hilbert space dimension .",
    "a lower bound for the volume of separable states  @xcite has been found , which decreases exponentially with @xmath0 . numerical evidence  @xcite supports the same trend .",
    "we now examine the viability of each method .",
    "we discuss three experimental approaches for increasing the initial polarization : 1 ) lowering the temperature , 2 ) increasing magnetic field strength , and 3 ) chemical and optical methods . as a reference ,",
    "a state - of - the - art liquid - state nmr experiment using seven proton nuclear spin molecules at room temperature has parameters @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 t , and @xmath77 k. a seven - qubit effective pure state must have @xmath78 to be outside of the nonentanglable regime described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gursep2 ] ) .",
    "lowering the temperature of the experiment is impractical because any appreciable improvement in polarization demands such a dramatic drop in temperature that the sample becomes solid .",

    ", the largest attainable field is 21 t. higher magnetic fields can be achieved with dc bitter resistive magnets ( 33 - 45 t ) and capacitively - driven magnets ( 50 - 60 t ) , but the generated fields are too spatially inhomogeneous to be used in liquid - state nmr .",
    "the magnets also consume massive power and require extensive cooling .",
    "inducing higher polarization by chemical and optical means is a much more promising approach and has already been experimentally demonstrated .",

    "@xcite have recently created two - qubit effective pure states with @xmath79 .",
    "these initial states are entangled according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : braunent ] ) .",
    "entanglement can also be achieved by using more qubits , but this approach is limited by substantial fundamental problems  @xcite . since individual spins are addressed by selective excitation , the resonance frequency of each spin must be well - separated from the others .",
    "this requirement may be satisfied by using nuclear spins of different chemical species .",

    "spins of the same type may also be used , but the largest number of homogeneous spins demonstrated in an experiment thus far  @xcite is @xmath85 .",
    "thus , for conventional liquid - state nmr quantum computation , the requirement of selective excitation restricts experiments to @xmath86 .",
    "it may be possible to improve upon this limit by using polymers  @xcite or higher - order spins .",
    "classical logic operations have been experimentally demonstrated in spin-3/2  @xcite and spin-7/2 nuclei  @xcite .",
    "algorithmic cooling is a compression technique that concentrates the polarization of many qubits into a smaller number of qubits .",
    "a well - known example is the schulman - vazirani procedure  @xcite , which starts with @xmath87 qubits in thermal equilibrium at polarization @xmath88 and extracts from these initial qubits a string of order @xmath89 qubits each with @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the probability of measuring @xmath37 .",
    "this method produces very pure qubits but at a high cost for the weak polarizations in current nmr experiments . for @xmath92 ,",
    "we need approximately @xmath93 initial thermal qubits to obtain just one pure qubit .",
    "the enormous number of initial qubits is needed because the schulman - vazirani procedure preserves the entropy of the system . if entropy conservation is circumvented , better results are possible .",
    "another scheme proposes to use an external set of spins that act as a heat bath  @xcite .",
    "this method can create effective pure states with initial to final qubit ratio of 50 .",
    "if @xmath4 can be boosted with some of the techniques previously mentioned , the schulman - vazirani procedure becomes more realistic .",
    "for example , beginning with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we can obtain one nearly pure qubit .      entangling nmr states via unitary operations",
    "has been largely unexplored .",

    "we choose @xmath96 as a starting point because it generates maximal entanglement when applied to the ground state .",

    "we can derive a formula for @xmath294 ) and use the majorization condition on von neumann entropy to find the minimum number of qubits needed for @xmath291 .",
    "we then set @xmath0 to this minimum value and increment @xmath0 until the majorization relation @xmath295 holds .",
    "alternatively , we can attempt to numerically optimize @xmath40 to be majorized by @xmath66 at fixed @xmath0 , increasing @xmath0 if the optimization fails .",
    "while we have not yet found a good construction for @xmath40 , we believe this majorization - based approach may be fruitful in future studies of nmr thermal state entanglability .",
    "in summary , we have obtained a bound on the entanglability of thermal states in liquid - state nmr by classifying the entanglement of bell - transformed thermal states .",
    "these results are confirmed by more direct calculations of npt bounds for two specific bipartite splits .",
    "this paper sought to investigate two related issues : 1 ) the nature of mixed state entanglement in quantum computation and 2 ) how to most efficiently achieve entanglement in a liquid - state nmr system .",
    "we have made some progress on both accounts .",
    "our tightest lower bound on thermal states scales as @xmath264 and provides us with a sense of the resource tradeoffs that must be made to achieve entanglement .",
    "moreover , this result explicitly shows that thermal states are more easily entangled than effective pure states .",
    "our bound identifies entanglable thermal states in @xmath0-@xmath4 space outside the best bound on entanglable effective pure states . assuming the largest reasonable initial polarization ( @xmath75 ) , we find that a thermal state must have @xmath296 to be entanglable , a limit that improves upon the dr - cirac constraint of @xmath266 for effective pure states .",
    "our methods exploit the symmetry of bell unitaries , but there is considerable room for improvement , especially if these studies of liquid - state nmr entanglement are to motivate practical experiments .",
    "we have suggested a majorization - based approach that uses a state @xmath40 of form @xmath184 to bound the entanglability of thermal state without having to choose a specific unitary .",
    "the missing piece is an efficient construction of @xmath40  a task we leave for future work .",

    "<S> the role of mixed state entanglement in liquid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) quantum computation is not yet well - understood . in particular , despite the success of quantum information processing with nmr , recent work has shown that quantum states used in most of those experiments were not entangled . </S>",
    "<S> this is because these states , derived by unitary transforms from the thermal equilibrium state , were too close to the maximally mixed state . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus motivated to determine whether a given nmr state is entanglable  that is , does there exist a unitary transform that entangles the state ? </S>",
    "<S> the boundary between entanglable and nonentanglable thermal states is a function of the spin system size @xmath0 and its temperature @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we provide new bounds on the location of this boundary using analytical and numerical methods ; our tightest bound scales as @xmath2 , giving a lower bound requiring at least @xmath3 proton spins to realize an entanglable thermal state at typical laboratory nmr magnetic fields . </S>",
