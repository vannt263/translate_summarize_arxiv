    "since the investigations of novoselov et al .",
    "@xcite were published , graphene has become one of the most popular subject of scientific researches due to its unique physical properties  @xcite .",
    "however , for the technical applications of graphene it is necessary to develop an effective method for producing highly crystalline wafer - scale graphene .",
    "the catalytic chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) of carbon precursors is one of the most widespread methods that have been used to grow wafer - scale graphene  @xcite .",
    "cvd is widely known to involve the decomposition of a carbon feedstock , either hydrocarbons or polymers , with the aid of heat and metal catalysts  @xcite .",
    "various metals , such as cu , ni , pt , ru , and ir , have been proven to catalyse the growth of graphene .",
    "the growth mechanism of graphene on cu is quite different from the others , because the solubility of carbon in the cu bulk is very low , and the mobility of carbon can be concluded to be a purely surface - based process  @xcite . as a result , the growth of graphene on cu is surface mediated and the limited diffusion of carbon into the cu bulk is occurred  @xcite .",
    "graphene can be nucleated on various crystal facets on cu  @xcite , however , the cu(111 ) surface is more preferable for the synthesis of high quality monolayer graphene  @xcite .",
    "two predominant graphene orientations on cu(111 ) have been observed  @xcite : one with zero rotational angle @xmath0 and large moir pattern ( @xmath1 nm periodicity ) and another with @xmath2 and smaller moir pattern ( @xmath3 nm periodicity ) .",
    "moir superstructures with another rotational angle ( @xmath4 ) are also observed  @xcite .",
    "the most widely used theoretical methods for the investigation of graphene growth on metal surfaces are the density functional theory ( dft ) and the molecular dynamics ( md ) .",
    "dft calculations are usually used for investigation of adsorption of carbon atoms , dimers and planar sheets of graphene on metal surfaces , while md is more appropriate for studying graphene properties at the mesoscopic scale .",
    "a lot of recent dft calculations  @xcite prove that graphene and cu(111 ) surface attract each other by van der waals forces .",
    "however , the numerical values of binding energies @xmath5 and binding distances @xmath6 of graphene on cu(111 ) surface are quite different for different forms of the exchange - correlation functional . for example",
    ", the local density approximation ( lda ) gives the following values of binging energy @xmath5 ( in mev / atom ) : @xmath7  @xcite , @xmath8  @xcite , @xmath9  @xcite , @xmath10  @xcite , @xmath11  @xcite , @xmath12  @xcite ; the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) leads to unstable configurations with positive binding energies  @xcite ; and the usage of the van der waals density functional ( vdw - df ) approximation leads to the following @xmath5 ( in mev / atom ) : @xmath13  @xcite , @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the values of binding distances @xmath6 of graphene on cu(111 ) surface vary from 2.23  @xcite to 3.26  @xcite in lda ; from 2.96  @xcite to 3.67  @xcite in vdw - df approximation ; and from 3.63  @xcite to 3.91  @xcite in gga . summarizing these results",
    ", one can see that dft calculations lead to ambiguous values of the binding energy @xmath15 mev / atom and the binding distance @xmath16 of graphene on cu(111 ) .",
    "this ambiguity dives us some freedom in the fitting of interatomic potentials .",
    "md simulations of graphene on cu surfaces allow to investigate such interesting phenomena as the formation of moir superlattices  @xcite , peeling and folding of graphene  @xcite , interaction of graphene with metal clusters  @xcite , and also jumping of metal nanodroplets  @xcite .",
    "usually , the lennard - jones ( l - j ) potential @xmath17\\ ] ] is used to describe van der waals interaction between carbon and cu atoms , where @xmath18 is the distance between the atoms @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the l - j parameters .",
    "the investigation  @xcite showed that parameters @xmath23 ev and @xmath24 lead to values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 which agree with the results of dft calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , the binding energy of graphene on cu(111 ) surface has only one minimum at @xmath25 .",
    "this result is in contradiction with the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "have fitted the abell - tersoff - like angular - dependent potential for the c - cu interaction  @xcite and shown that the binding energy of graphene on cu(111 ) surface has local minima at the following @xmath0 : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "it is necessary to underline that only three from six orientations have been observed experimentally  @xcite . besides , we have some doubts that the abell - tersoff potential can correctly describe van der waals interaction . in this paper",
    "we will show that it is possible to fit l - j potential which leads to the correct values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 and , at the same time , gives two different moir superstructures with rotational angles @xmath32 and @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ method ] ,",
