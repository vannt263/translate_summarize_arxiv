    "the peierls semiconductor @xmath0 , parent compound of the high-@xmath1 superconductor @xmath2 , has long been of theoretical and experimental interest due to its distinct negative - u nature . this behavior can be understood through the concept of `` forbidden valence '' suggesting that in @xmath0   bismuth atoms appear in two different valences ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , but _ skip _ the forbidden formal valence in - between ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the `` valence - skipper '' bismuth atoms hence disproportionate , i.e. every second bi atom donates all 5 valence electrons to oxygen , whereas the other bi atom retains two 6s electrons and only donates the three 6p electrons to the oxygen atoms .",
    "such a behavior is usually explained by the concept of a negative u which invalidates the usual positive coulomb repulsion between two electrons@xcite .",
    "the charge disproportionation goes in hand with significant structural changes from the ideal cubic perovskite crystal towards a distorted monoclinic structure characterized by a short - ranged charge density wave ( cdw ) state formed by alternating breathing - in and breathing - out distortions of oxygen octahedra around inequivalent @xmath6 ( bi1 ) and @xmath7 ( bi2 ) ions ( fig .",
    "[ bt ] ) . as a consequence of this charge ordering",
    ", the formally expected metallic state for the cubic perovskite @xmath8 is replaced by an insulating regime characterized by a large direct cdw optical response @xmath9 2.0 ev@xcite and an indirect optical transition @xmath10 .",
    "although @xmath0  has been the subject of numerous optical investigations , dissenting opinions were reported on the value of the indirect gap @xmath10 , for which conflicting measurements are reported in literature , ranging from 0.2 ev@xcite and 1.1 ev@xcite .",
    "( bi1 ) and @xmath7 ( bi2 ) indicate the two inequivalent bismuth ions , whereas the arrows indicate the breathing displacement of the oxygen atoms .",
    "( c ) schematic view of the @xmath0  unit cell showing the @xmath11 tilted octahedra .",
    "color coding : darker ( red ) areas indicates a high value of the charge density.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    despite the apparent absence of strong electron localization usually associated with @xmath12 and @xmath13 electrons , standard semilocal density functionals exhibit severe problems in describing the basic properties of this material , yielding much too small or even negative band gaps@xcite , thus preventing a detailed description of the electronic properties . in a recent paper , we have explained the polaron - mediated insulator - to - metal transition experimentally observed in k - doped @xmath0 by means of hybrid density functional theory .",
    "we have shown that semilocal functionals are incapable ( i ) to disclose the underlying physics of this type of electronic transition and , more generally , ( ii ) to account for `` long range '' peierls - like distortions in doped @xmath0@xcite . the objective of the present study is to apply the screened exchange hybrid density functional theory ( dft ) heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse ) functional@xcite to the ground state structural , electronic and vibrational properties of @xmath0 , and to investigate to which extent many - body effects may alter the ground state and quasi - particle ( qp ) properties of @xmath0 .",
    "we address the latter issue by adopting the gw approach .",
    "these calculations essentially confirm the picture emerging from the hybrid functional .",
    "details of our computational approach are described in the methodological section , whereas the results are presented and discussed in sec.[sec:3 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ z ]    finally , we list in tab .",
    "[ z ] the computed bec @xmath14 .",
    "we find that the bec tensor is diagonal and reduces to a scalar matrix for ba and bi ( i.e. @xmath15 ) and to two components @xmath16 and @xmath17 for o with respect to the bi - o bond . in agreement with precedent estimations of thonhauser and rabe@xcite",
    "we observe a significant bec disproportionation between bi1 and b2 ( @xmath18 ) , substantially larger than the corresponding static charge transfer @xmath19 discussed above ( see tab . [ lcharge ] ) .",
    "the incorporation of non - local exchange effects through hse reduces the dynamical charge disproportionation from 1.66 @xmath20 ( pbe ) to 0.97 @xmath20 ( hse ) and leaves the ba and o bec s unchanged .",
    "the average bec of oxygen -3.13 @xmath20 equals the experimentally derived value of -3.2 @xmath20@xcite .",
    "in summary , by means of beyond - dft methods we have computed ground and excited state properties of @xmath0 . on the basis of hybrid functionals and fully _ ab initio _ gw methods",
    ", we have shown that the inclusion of non - local exchange effects is essential to reproduce and understand the complex physical properties of @xmath0 .",
    "our calculated structural distortions ( oxygen instabilities and cubic - to - monoclinic transition ) , optical excitations ( direct / indirect band gap and optical spectrum ) , dielectric ( dielectric constant ) and vibrational properties ( phonon frequencies , infrared reflectivity and born effective charges ) reproduce well the available experimental findings .",
    "overall , our study suggests that the gw approaches tend to overestimate the band gap , which seems to be better predicted within the screened hybrid hse functional .",
    "although the inclusion of an effective non - local exchange - correlation kernel @xmath21 at td - hse ( @xmath22 ) and bse - gw ( @xmath23 ) level improves the single - shot @xmath24 description , the resulting band gap is still @xmath25 15% ( e@xmath26 ) and 40% ( e@xmath27 ) larger than the corresponding _ bare _ hse value .",
    "the source of this error as far as it can not be attributed to uncertainties in the experimental results likely resides in the neglect of many - body vertex corrections in the self - energy @xmath28 , which are entirely neglected in this work , or any other gw implementation . though @xmath23 has proven to be excellent for the prediction of the band gaps of typical semiconductor , insulator and noble gas solids it",
    "was never applied to more complex oxides such as @xmath0 .",
    "given the lack of accurate experimental information on the electronic properties of @xmath0 ( especially for the indirect gap e@xmath27 ) the assessment of these gw techniques to less critical oxides for which well established experimental data exists is highly required .",
    "concluding , our research on @xmath0 clarifies the serious drawbacks of standard dft and provide a key to understand and design similar charge - ordered materials .",
    "we hope that our study can boost for new experiments as well as for thorough theoretical and computational efforts aiming to straighten the issues still under debate .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the hybrid functional hse yields a description which is at least on par with sophisticated man - body techniques .",
