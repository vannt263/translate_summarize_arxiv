    "@xmath0 ( 28 ) cma ( hd 56139 , hr2749 ; b3ve ) is one of the most observed southern be stars .",
    "long - term photometric monitoring exhibits a quasi - regular cyclic variation with an amplitude of about 0.@xmath15 in the @xmath2-band .",
    "this allows to study evolution of the disk in detail . in each cycle a new disk is formed during 2 - 3 years , and then dissipated in 5 - 6 years .",
    "carciofi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) used @xmath0 cma to model , for the first time , the light curve of a be star based on the viscous decretion disk ( vdd ) model ( the theoretical description of the model is given by haubois et al .",
    "the model of the dissipation curve allowed the authors to determine that the viscosity parameter of shakura - sunyaev ( shakura & sunyaev , 1973 ) is @xmath3 = 1.0 @xmath4 0.2 .",
    "such value for @xmath3 suggests that viscosity may be produced by a disk instability whose growth is limited by shock dissipation ( carciofi et al . , 2012 ) .    the work of carciofi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) represented just a first step towards understating the physical conditions of @xmath0 cma s disk .",
    "as such , the study had several limitations , among which we cite the fact that @xmath3 was determined only during the phase of disk dissipation and by fitting only the @xmath2-band light curve .",
    "lifting these limitation is the main motivation for this work .",
    "we used the time - dependent hydrodynamics code singlebe ( okazaki et al .",
    "2002 ; okazaki 2007 ) to model the disk surface density evolution given a prescription for the disk feeding history . to do that , several outbursts and quiescence phases with various time - scales , few weeks to few years , were considered . the surface density converted to volume density then is used as input for the three - dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer code , hdust ( carciofi & bjorkman 2006 ) to obtain the emergent spectral energy distribution ( and other observables of interest ) , which is used to calculate the @xmath2-band excess , @xmath5@xmath2 , of the disk as a function of time .    for the results of fig .",
    "1 we adopted as stellar parameters the ones used by carciofi et al . ( 2012 ) and let the mass decretion rate vary in amplitude with time , in a fashion described in fig .",
    "one of the features of @xmath0 cma s lightcurve is an obvious decline in the brightness of the system in the successive dissipation phases ( green line in fig .",
    "1 ) . we found that one possibility to interpret this behavior is to consider that at quiescence the star shifts to a lower mass decretion rate instead of entering a state of absolute quiescence .",
    "our model shows the value of @xmath3 should not be far from 1.0 at least for the most part . in fig .",
    "3 we show the first model of a be disk build - up ( for phase @xmath6 in fig .",
    "4 ) , and this model is broadly consistent with a alpha of unity .    the dissipation phase marked as ii in fig .",
    "4 presented a challenge for the model , as it is seemingly not consistent with and alpha of unity .",
    "instead , a much lower alpha=0.1 seems to better reproduce the data .",
    "this fit is still under investigation , since the slower dissipation in phase ii may simply be the result of small - scale outbursts during the disk dissipation phase .    according to the obtained results",
    ", we found that the mass decretion rate of @xmath0 cma displays a complex history including both short and long time - scales , also very different range of variation ( fig .",
    "we present a complete model of the disk evolution of @xmath0 cma for the past forty years . for the first time , both outburst and quiescence phases were modeled with a single model .",
    "a very puzzling feature of @xmath0 cma is the slow secular fading shown in the past forty years , in which each quiescent phase is less bright than the previous one . here",
    ", we present one possible explanation for this phenomenon , by assuming that the mass decretion rate did not go to zero at quiescence , but instead assumed a smaller value ( fig .",
    "the validity of this assumption needs to be ascertained by modeling other observables in addition to @xmath2-band magnitude",
    ". this will be the subject of future work .",
    "this work made use of the computing facilities of the laboratory of astroinformatics ( iag / usp , nat / unicsul ) , whose purchase was made possible by the brazilian agency fapesp ( grant no 2009/54006 - 4 ) and the inct - a .",
