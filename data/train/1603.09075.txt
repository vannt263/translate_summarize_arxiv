    "the auroral vortex street structure with a scale of 3070 km has been investigated as a key to resolve the onset mechanisms of large - scale magnetospheric deformation or auroral breakup called substorm [ donovan et al .",
    ", 2007 ; sakaguchi et al . , 2009 ] . from observations of geotail and themis satellites ,",
    "it has been known that , even without any external input , plasmas are heated up to produce strong flow perturbations at a radial distance of @xmath1 @xmath2 that corresponds to the auroral region [ zesta et al . , 2000 ; keiling et al . , 2009 ; lee et al . ,",
    "it is an established theory that an enhancement of plasma pressure triggers some instabilities in the magnetosphere , and field - aligned currents flow into the ionosphere , causing formation of bright auroral vortices [ e.g. , lui et al .",
    "it has been suggested that such a coherent structure in aurora is involved in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves , especially , alfv@xmath0n waves , that develops along the field line [ samson et al . , 1992 ; erickson et al . ,",
    "three - dimensional mhd simulations including magnetosphere - ionosphere ( m - i ) coupling were vigorously performed to interpret the vortex formation in aurora [ jia and streltsov , 2014 ; hiraki , 2015a , b ] .",
    "jia and streltsov [ 2014 ] treated propagation and feedback instability of alfv@xmath0n waves initiated by arc - like ionospheric density perturbation .",
    "they suggested that various structures form in aurora , or field - aligned currents , through changes in a set of controlled parameters in the system .",
    "however , their results showed that the time scale of auroral intensification and horizontal propagation of vortices reaches 200 s , which is still longer than the observed scale ( @xmath3 s ) .",
    "furthermore , the value of field - aligned currents was smaller by over one - order than the estimated values ( tens of @xmath4a / m@xmath5 ) in observations [ e.g. , dubyagin et al . ,",
    "the lower estimate could mainly originate from the initial condition ( or stability of the perturbations ) ; more unstable eigenmodes of alfv@xmath0n waves may control the system .    on the contrary , hiraki [ 2015b ] performed a linear analysis of the feedback instability for realistic sets of convection electric field and conductivity and clarified the features of alfv@xmath0n eigenmodes with maximum growth rates .",
    "their mhd simulations demonstrated that the auroral vortex street develops in a fast time scale of 3040 s , with a horizontal scale of 2040 km and a strong field - aligned current of 1020 @xmath4a / m@xmath5 .",
    "splitting and dimming ( a decrease in upward currents ) of auroral arcs appear through a bounce motion of alfv@xmath0n waves .",
    "a vortex street forms just after that , leading to a rapid intensification of arcs ( i.e. , an increase in upward currents ) .",
    "the sequence of these phenomena is consistent with substorm - related processes in past observations : fading , bead structure , and auroral breakup [ e.g. , mende et al . ,",
    "2009 ] .",
    "when a field - aligned current flows out from the ionosphere ( especially , e - layer ) , the cold electron flux increases to cause a density fluctuation , and a new electric field anti - parallel to the ambient field is produced .",
    "the current produced by this `` charge - up '' process is often called as polarization current , or the cowling channel [ baumjohann , 1983 ; haerendel , 2008 ; amm et al . , 2013 ; yoshikawa et al . ,",
    "previous studies have suggested that auroral structuring is attributed to this polarization current , especially due to a divergence of the hall current [ buchert and budnik , 1997 ; amm and fujii , 2008 ] .",
    "fujii et al .  [ 2012 ] presented a new model for the behavior of auroral arcs .",
    "considering an arc with a finite length , an east - west directed electric field can be produced by the cowling polarization .",
    "they pointed out that the polarization electric field creates a fast southward @xmath6 drift of arcs , which has been often seen at the onset of substorms .",
    "apart from auroral structures , jia and streltsov [ 2014 ] and hiraki [ 2015a , b ] treated all components of the electric field perturbation , the density perturbation , and these product ( nonlinear term ) of the ionospheric pedersen / hall currents .",
    "these are generally defined as a full set of the cowling polarization currents [ yoshikawa et al . ,",
    "2013 ] .",
    "no complete understanding has not been presented for ionospheric horizontal currents accompanied by the auroral vortex street .",
    "our previous study [ hiraki , 2015b ] showed only the temporal variation in the pedersen / hall currents associated with growth of alfv@xmath0n waves , but did not interpret physics of the current balance .",
    "the first purpose of this study is to revisit the physics of vortex formation on the view point of horizontal currents .",
    "different from the quantities of alfv@xmath0n waves , the advantage of the pedersen / hall currents is to be measured directly by ground magnetometer and ionospheric convective flow observations .",
    "the analysis of growing modes expected that the vortex street motion points nearly parallel to the ionospheric horizontal ( pedersen + hall ) currents .",
    "this theoretical speculation could be compared with precise optical observations that can determine the direction of wavefronts . on the other hand , a statistical analysis by fujii et al .  [",
    "2012 ] signified that the speed of auroral arcs is independent of the ambient convection speed .",
    "the second purpose of this study with exact numerical simulations is to verify their scenario of auroral intensification by the cowling effect , although the model setup is somewhat different .",
    "the same equations as hiraki [ 2015b ] are used to describe the motion of shear alfv@xmath0n waves involved in auroral structuring .",
    "shear alfv@xmath0n waves penetrate into the ionosphere and are destabilized due to an enhancement of plasma convection .",
    "the equations for ionospheric plasma are also the same as those of hiraki [ 2015b ] .",

    "the field @xmath149 is carried by alfv@xmath0n waves from an external space to cancel the ambient @xmath168 and can be regarded as an east - west electric field tangential to the auroral arc proposed by haerendel [ 2008 ] .",
    "and , when the tangential field exceeds a certain level , the vortex street forms leading to auroral breakup . buchert and budnik [ 1997 ] presented a similar scenario that an east - west induced electric field magnifies the upward currents .",
    "the relationship between the pedersen and hall currents inside of the vortex at the final stage @xmath169 are essentially the same as a schematic view of classical cowling channel patterns [ baumjohann , 1983 ; yoshikawa et al . ,",
    "that is , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath101 and @xmath172 .",
    "note that , on the other hand , the primary @xmath114 points poleward in the classical case originated from a tangential field .",
    "we could apply our current model to the situations in some previous studies .",
    "fujii et al .  [",
    "2012 ] presented the cowling current system due to a secondary electric field related to a fully developed auroral arc .",
    "they supposed that there is an auroral arc accompanying an upward current and a downward current in the equatorward side , and these currents balance with the poleward pedersen current ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "they also required finiteness of the arc length and that the pedersen and hall currents flow in different altitudes .",
    "in these conditions , an eastward hall current due to the primary field @xmath114 ( hereafter , @xmath174 ) is diverged .",
    "since the divergence becomes much strong due to electron precipitation at the upward current region , new currents @xmath109 and @xmath116 are produced at the west / east edges of the arc , respectively .",
    "new currents flowing out to the pedersen layer , an westward pedersen current @xmath175 , or an westward secondary electric field , is induced .",
    "they called this the cowling current .",
    "finiteness of the arc length may equal winding ( vortices ) of the arc - induced @xmath74 and @xmath129 in our calculation . from figs .",
    "2(c ) and 3(f ) , we find that the current that balances to the pair currents is an eastward hall current @xmath174 , and an westward pedersen current @xmath176 develops in its anti - parallel direction .",
    "this current system is consistent with that proposed by fujii et al .  [",
    "the new point of our system is that , inside of the vortex , there are an equatorward hall current @xmath177 induced by the pair currents @xmath44 and an equatorward pedersen current @xmath178 due to polarization @xmath133 .",
    "the above four currents are generally defined as a complete set of the cowling current [ yoshikawa et al . ,",
    "because the arc length is not finite in our case , not so strong westward pedersen current develops at the equatorward side arc at @xmath17945 km .",
    "wild et al .  [ 2000 ] presented a schematic interpretation of the horizontal currents related to auroral omega bands from observations of ion velocity by superdarn radar and ground - magnetometer .",
    "we expect that current closures have a similarity between omega bands in a scale of 500 km and vortex streets in a scale less than 50 km .",
    "they observed an enhancement of auroral luminosity ( upward current ) at the westward side of an omega band .",
    "they interpreted that the upward current balances with an westward pedersen current ( or electric field ) and a downward current developed in the eastward side .",
    "the westward field produces a poleward @xmath180 inside of the omega band , flowing around the upward / downward currents .",
    "they speculated that an @xmath181 flow , anti - parallel to @xmath174 in our terminology , corresponds to an observed poleward flow at a dark region between omega shapes .",
    "we argued their interpretation not to be unique .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "3(f ) , the current that balances to the pair @xmath44 on both sides of a vortex is not the pedersen current but an westward hall current @xmath182 ; it induces an eastward pedersen current @xmath183 ( or @xmath184 ) . the hall current @xmath177 produced by @xmath184 points equatorward in our case , which is the opposite direction to the current @xmath174 of wild [ 2000 ] s case .",
    "however , the field @xmath184 also produce a poleward flow at the westward side of the upward @xmath44 , which is consistent with the poleward flow in their observations .",
    "our point is that a precise measurement of all variables ( @xmath118 , @xmath26 , @xmath185 , and @xmath44 ) enables us to decide whether the currents around vortices are pedersen - like or hall - like .",
    "as a series of studies from hiraki [ 2015b ] , this study performed numerical simulations of alfv@xmath0n waves destabilized in the mi coupling system and clarified the characteristics of the current system accompanied by auroral vortex streets ; here , upward field - aligned current @xmath44 of alfv@xmath0n waves is considered to represent the auroral structure .",
    "the horizontal current is partitioned into the pedersen and hall currents and is further divided into two components due to the perturbed electric field @xmath185 by alfv@xmath0n waves and the perturbed electron density @xmath118 ( or polarization ) .",
    "it was found that ( i ) at the initial stage , the arc - induced upward / downward @xmath44 induce convergence / divergence of the polarized component of the pedersen current ; here , the ambient electric field @xmath26 points poleward .",
    "( ii ) a new upward @xmath44 with a patchy structure is produced at equatorward of the downward @xmath44 and balances with the polarized component of the hall current .",
    "( iii ) when a vortex street develops from the patch along with an winded downward @xmath44 , an upward @xmath44 forms in the leading side of the vortex ; it moves westward ( @xmath186 ) in our setting . a downward @xmath44 forming in the trailing side , these pair currents balance with an westward polarized component of the hall current .",
    "it generates an eastward perturbed component of the pedersen current inside of the vortex where there is no @xmath44 .",
    "on the other hand , counter - clockwise / clockwise patterns of the perturbed component of the hall current form around the pair currents @xmath74 and @xmath129 ( both edges of the vortex ) , respectively .",
    "the hall current inside of the vortex points equatorward , and the polarized component of the pedersen current is induced in the same direction .",
    "we expect that the complex current system of field - aligned and pedersen / hall currents yield a basic model to comprehend the realistic current systems accompanied by curl , spiral , and omega band structures observed at substorm periods .",
