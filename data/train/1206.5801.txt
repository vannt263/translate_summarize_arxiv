    "strong gravitational lenses are powerful cosmological probes . the distorted images of lensed background sources carry information on the distribution of invisible matter in cosmic structures . furthermore , as light - rays from distant variable sources propagate along differently distorted paths , time - delays between luminosity variations of the source images test the underlying cosmological expansion ( for exhaustive review see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the use of lens time - delays as cosmic standard rulers was initially proposed by @xcite . to date",
    "time - delays have been measured only in 21 lensed quasars out of the few hundreds known strong lens systems . despite the scarcity of observations , lots of effort has been devoted to using these data to infer the value of the hubble constant , @xmath3 .",
    "this is because time - delays , differently from other standard cosmological tests , do not rely on local calibration measurements , such as the distance ladder method ( for an alternative method see * ? ? ?",
    "in the next decade , additional lens time - delay data will become available thanks to observational programs such as the cosmograil project collaboration , as well as the ilmt project .",
    "furthermore , the next generation of cosmic structure surveys such as the dark energy survey ( des ) , the large synoptic telescope ( lsst ) or the euclid satellite mission will detect large sample of strong lens systems for which time - delays can be accurately measured through follow - up observations .",
    "time - delays from such datasets will be particularly useful to infer cosmological constraints that are complementary to those obtained from other cosmic probes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "time - delay measurements are particularly challenging because they require an intense monitoring of the lens system .",
    "however , the main limitation to fully exploit the cosmological information encoded in such data arises from the uncertainty on the lens mass distribution as well as the presence of perturbing masses along the line - of - sight .",
    "because of this , several analyses have focused on `` golden lenses '' @xcite .",
    "these are systems for which there is a sufficient number of observational features ( e.g. presence of arcs , multiple point - like images , flux ratios measurements ) such as to constrain the lens potential independently of time - delays .",
    "for example , @xcite have studied the lens system b0218 + 357 and inferred @xmath4 for a flat cold dark matter model with cosmological constant ( @xmath1cdm ) with mean matter density @xmath5 . @xcite",
    "have analysed the lens b1608 + 656 and for the same cosmology they have obtained @xmath6 .",
    "alternatively one can infer cosmological parameter constraints using a statistical sample of lens time - delay measurements ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "such an approach still requires modeling the gravitational potential of each lens in the sample .",
    "nevertheless , one can hope that systematics due to individual mass model uncertainties are averaged out . in such a case sample selection effects",
    "can be the main source of error @xcite .",
    "modeling the lens mass distribution can be distinguished in parametric ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and non - parametric ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) methods .",
    "the latter uses linear inversion algorithms to constrain the lens potential directly from the intensity images of the lens system , while the former uses the measured properties of the lens to constrain a parametrized form of the lens potential .",
    "a third approach by @xcite reconstructs the lens potential as a perturbative expansion around the einstein ring of the lens system .",
    "non - parametric methods have been extensively used in a vast literature . as an example a non - parametric reconstruction algorithm is implemented in pixelens@xcite , a numerical code commonly used for lens studies . using this code @xcite have found @xmath7 from a sample of @xmath8 time - delay lenses for a flat @xmath1cdm with @xmath5 . recently @xcite have performed the same analysis on an extended sample of @xmath9 lenses and obtained @xmath10 .",
    "a statistical analysis of a sample of lensed quasars using a parametric approach has been performed by a number of authors .",
    "for instance , assuming an isothermal lens potential @xcite have inferred limits on @xmath3 for different cosmological models .",
    "the analysis by @xcite has propagated the uncertainties in the lens model parameters and found @xmath11 from a sample of @xmath12 lenses for a flat @xmath1cdm with @xmath13 . whether using non - parametric lens reconstruction algorithms or a parametric model a key aspect of these analyses is the assessment of what constitutes a good description of the lens potential given the data .",
    "independently of the approach used , distinguishing between the potentially infinite number of possibilities has been mostly based on @xmath14-statistics . however , parameter fitting only establishes how well a model reproduce the data for a given set of model parameter values .",
    "deciding whether one model is preferable over another is a question of _ model selection _ rather than quality of parameter fit .",
    "in other words , which model has a higher probability of being the correct model description of the observations ? do the data justify a more complex description of the system ( additional parameters ) ?    in the bayesian statistical framework these questions",
    "are addressed by the analysis of the bayesian evidence and the evaluation of bayes factor @xcite .",
    "bayesian model selection methods have already been applied to a variety of problems in cosmology and astrophysics ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",

    "in the literature , the analysis of bayes factors has been applied to non - parametric lens reconstruction techniques @xcite as well as selecting complicate parametric lens models of galaxy clusters @xcite .    here ,",
    "we present a case study of the use of bayes factors to construct a homogeneous sample of double lensed quasars to derive bounds on @xmath3 . by homogeneous",
    "we mean a sample consisting of lenses whose data , astrometry and time - delays of the images , provide evidence for the same lens model description at the same level of statistical significance .",
    "differently from previous statistical approaches we consistently propagate all observational uncertainties on the posterior probabilities , including errors on the angular position of the images , as well as marginalizing over nuissance model parameters rather than assuming hard priors .",
    "the possibility of selecting homogeneous lens data to infer cosmological parameter constraints will become particularly important for future survey programs which will detect a large number of strong gravitational lenses .",
    "we argue that the use of bayes factors provides a self - consistent probabilistic method to build subsample of data which are not dominated by astrophysical selection effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ lenseq ] we review the lens equations and the modeling of the gravitational lens potential , while in section [ bayesanalysis ] we discuss the bayesian model selection .",
    "we present the results of the lens model selection analysis on simulated data in section [ testbayes ] and on real data in section [ modelselection ] . in section [ h0results ]",
    "we describe the results of the cosmological parameter inference and present our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "here , we briefly review the basic equations describing the formation of images in strong gravitational lenses .",
    "we assume that the source is lensed by an object that can be treated as a single lens plane .",
    "let us consider an angular coordinate system centered on a lens at redshift @xmath15 and a source with angular position @xmath16 at redshift @xmath17 . according to fermat s principle light - rays from the source follow paths that extremize the arrival - time .",
    "let @xmath18 be the arrival - time of rays observed at an angle @xmath19 .",
    "we can estimate this function by considering the geodesics of photons connecting the source - lens and the lens - observer planes respectively .",
    "two effects contribute to the arrival - time , a geometrical term which accounts for the different length of the lensed paths and a gravitational term due to the shapiro effect ( for a detailed derivation e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "the geometrical contribution reads as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the speed of light , while @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the angular diameter distances between observer and lens , observer and source , and lens and source respectively ; in the following , we note @xmath25 and @xmath26 the norms of @xmath19 and @xmath16 .",
    "the gravitational term is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a 2-d gravitational potential generated by the projected surface mass density on the lens plane at the angular position of the source , @xmath29 , as given by the poisson - like equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the newton gravitational constant .",
    "it is useful to introduce the critical density @xmath32 , the convergence @xmath33 and the reduced potential @xmath34 to write the total arrival - time as @xmath35,\\ ] ] from which we can derive all relevant equations describing the properties of the images .",
    "* lens equation * : let us assume the source to be fixed at the angular location @xmath16 , the arrival - time only depends on @xmath19 and images will form at extrema of the arrival time corresponding to @xmath36 . using eq .",
    "( [ time ] ) we obtain the lens equation @xmath37    * magnification * : gravitational lensing deforms the images of a lensed source and since the luminosity per surface area is conserved , images can appear magnified or demagnified .",
    "the amplitude of the effect can be quantified by considering the relation between the coordinates on the source plane and the lens one .",
    "let @xmath38 be the jacobian matrix of the angular coordinate transformation , this relation implies that a solid - angle element @xmath39 of the source is mapped to a solid - angle element of the image @xmath40 by the inverse of the determinant of @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the magnification is given by @xmath42    * time - delay * : let us consider a double - image lensed source characterized by a time - variable luminosity , the time - delay in the appearance of the luminosity variation between two images a and b is given by : @xmath43\\nonumber.\\\\\\label{dt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the position of the images , their relative flux ratios and time - delays are the main observable features of a strong lens systems .      our goal is to select a homogeneous sample of simple lens systems that can be easily observed in large sky surveys .",
    "for this reason we focus on individual galaxies which lens distant quasar sources .",
    "the mass distribution of lens spiral and elliptical galaxies is well approximated by power - law density profiles ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for which the lens potential assume the form : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a deflection scale .",
    "the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model @xcite corresponds to @xmath46 , for which @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the velocity dispersion of the galaxy .",
    "measurements of galaxy density profiles indicates that the slope parameter @xmath49 is generally close to the isothermal value , though some systems have revealed shallow profiles with @xmath50 ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by computing the second derivative of eq",
    "( [ pow ] ) with respect to @xmath25 we obtain the convergence : @xmath51 in the case of a double image lens with point - like images located at @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the deflection scale can be written as : @xmath54 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ lensequation ] ) .",
    "for such a system the time - delay between the two images is given by @xcite : @xmath55+\\nonumber\\\\ & -&2\\int_{\\theta_a}^{\\theta_b}\\left[\\kappa(\\theta)-\\langle\\kappa\\rangle\\right]\\log\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_b}\\right)\\theta\\,d\\theta\\biggr\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the mean surface mass density in the ring between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the above formulae can be rewritten using eq .",

    "similarly we can write the flux - ratios between images a and b in terms of their angular positions and the parameters of the power law potential using eq .",
    "( [ mag ] ) .",
    "the flux - ratio is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60\\left[1-(2-n)\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{i}}{b}\\right)^{1-n}\\right ] \\right|,\\label{oneoverflux}\\ ] ] with @xmath61 .",
    "this accounts only for luminosity differences between images due to lensing magnification .",
    "> from eq .",
    "( [ oneoverflux ] ) we can see that flux - ratio measurements can strongly constrain the lens model parameters , thus in combination with time - delays such data can reduce or break the mass - sheet degeneracy and lead to tighter bounds on cosmological parameters .",
    "several source of systematic errors currently limit the use of flux - ratio measurements .",
    "in fact , these can be affected by inhomogeneous dust extinction across the angular size of the lens system , thus altering the contribution of the lens magnification encoded in the flux - ratio measurements . in principle dust effects",
    "can be taken into account through color analysis .",
    "on the other hand , rapidly varying lensing effects can be a more important source of systematic uncertainty that remains hard to model .",
    "as shown by @xcite in the case of the double image lens q0957 + 561 flux - ratios can vary over time .",
    "fine variations on short time scales can be caused by microlensing of the structure of the lensed quasar , while trends over longer periods are more indicative of the mass spectrum of the lens galaxy .",
    "radio measurements of flux ratios are primarely affected by milli - lensing events , while in the optical both milli - lensing and micro - lensing causes flux anomalies . in the latter case",
    "flux - ratio estimates from spectroscopic measurements may alleviate the systematic effect due to micro - lensing as recently pointed out by @xcite .",
    "henceforth , it is not surprising that flux - ratios can be an effective probe of the lens mass distribution ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but at the same time if unmodelled , flux anomalies introduce dominant systematic errors in the cosmological parameter inference . overcoming these limitations",
    "requires a systematic monitoring of the lens systems phased on the lens time - delay as well as an accurate modeling of the lens inner structure .",
    "such detailed analyses have yet to be performed and are beyond the scope of our work . because of this cosmological constraints inferred in combination with flux - ratio measurements should be taken with a grain of salt . in section [ bayesfactoranalysis ]",
    "we will show results obtained by combining time - delays with flux ratios only for illustrative purposes .",
    "the presence of mass perturbators outside the lens system can directly alter the lens potential and introduce uncertainties in the modeling of the lens potential .",
    "this is especially the case if a single lens galaxy is not isolated , rather is part of a group or a cluster of galaxies where an external shear field can deform the monopole potential eq .",
    "( [ pow ] ) .",
    "such deformation can be modeled by adding a quadrupole term and in polar angular coordinates @xmath62 this reads as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an amplitude parameter which measure the strength of the external shear and @xmath65 its direction .",
    "observational constraints on the external shear have been mainly inferred from the study of multiple image lenses . as an example , a number of studies of individual quadruple lens systems have shown that the shear amplitude is rather large , @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , earlier expectations were in the range @xmath67 @xcite . using results from n - body simulations in combination with semi - analytic models of galaxy formation @xcite",
    "have shown that distribution of values of @xmath64 is nearly - gaussian with a peak at @xmath68 and a rapid decay for @xmath69 .",
    "on the other hand @xcite have performed an accurate study of nine lens systems in galaxy groups and clusters which indicates that on average @xmath70 , with a distribution ranging from @xmath71 to @xmath72 .",
    "accounting for the effect of external shear as described by eq .",
    "( [ shear ] ) adds two parameters to the lens model .",
    "consequently , eq .  ( [ timedelay])-([oneoverflux ] ) are modified by terms which explicitely depends on the external shear parameters .",
    "such terms can be computed analytically using eq .",
    "( [ shear ] ) , their derivation is quite cumbersome and we leave it to appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "an important aspect of the presence of external shear concerns the geometrical configuration of the images .",
    "in particular the angular separation of the images @xmath73 , the asymmetry @xmath74 , and the the deviation from colinearity @xmath75 are indicators of perturbations about a monopole - like lens potential . as an example , @xcite have shown that the time - delays have little sensitivity to the quadrupole term if the images are opposite to each other with respect to the lens position .",
    "similarly , @xcite has shown that for image pairs with an asymmetry parameter @xmath76 the time - delay is not significantly influenced by an external shear , a third - order external perturbation or the presence of dark matter subhalos . in contrast , for such systems the time - delay is more sensitive to the radial slope of the potential ( which quantifies the deviation from isothermality ) , which appears to be the case especially for image pairs with a wide angular separation .",
    "this offer a first empirical criterion to select a homogeneous lens sample .",
    "in addition to external shear , a non - spherical lens mass distribution can lead to a non - trivial angular dependence of the lens potential that contributes to the time - delay .",
    "if unmodelled this also introduce a systematic error altering the cosmological parameter inference . in the case of lenses with images lying opposite to each other the contribution from this internal shear appears only as a second order correction to the time - delay @xcite .",
    "this suggests that in general the presence of internal shear should not be neglected .",
    "our goal is to use bayesian model selection to construct a statistically homogeneous sample of gravitational lenses from which to infer cosmological constraints using time - delays .",
    "more specifically , we aim to select lenses for which data provide strong evidence in favor of a simple power - law model description and exclude with high statistical significance the presence of external shear which might contribute to sample selection effects in single lens galaxies . here",
    "we review the basic elements of bayesian statistical analysis .",
    "let us consider a set of observations of a double image lens @xmath77 , consisting of the angular position of the images @xmath78 ( @xmath61 ) , the time - delay @xmath79 ( and eventually flux ratio @xmath80 ) .",
    "we want to constrain a lens model @xmath81 specified by a set of model parameters @xmath82 . for the time",
    "being let us assume hard priors on the cosmological parameters which determine the cosmic angular distances in eq .",
    "( [ dt ] ) .",
    "the first step of the data model comparison consists of inferring the best fit values of the lens model parameters as well as their uncertainties expressed in terms of `` credible intervals '' . to this end",
    "we promote the model parameters to random variables and use the bayes theorem to infer their posterior probability distribution of the parameters given the data and the model @xmath81 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the likelihood function , @xmath85 is the prior parameter model probability and @xmath86 is the bayesian `` evidence '' .",
    "notice that the likelihood is not a probability distribution in the parameters @xmath82 , since it gives the probability of the data @xmath77 for a given value of the model parameters .",
    "in contrast , the evidence is the probability of the observed data within the assumed model @xmath81 and appears as an overall normalization constant of the posterior .",
    "hence , for parameter estimation purposes the evidence can be neglected since we are interested in finding the maximum of the posterior and the dispersion around it .",
    "this can be done by computing the likelihood function , which for a set of independent data reads as : @xmath87 ^ 2}{2\\,\\sigma_{i}^2}\\right\\},\\label{likenoerr}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 are the observational uncertainties and @xmath89 are the model predictions .",
    "however , notice that in our case , the position of the images , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , play the role of independent variables in @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively . since , the measured angles are known up to observational errors , it is important to propagate the angular uncertainties as well .",
    "this can be consistently done in the bayesian framework . for a detailed discussion on the subject we refer to the exhaustive article by dagostini @xcite .",
    "let assume that the observed image positions , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , are determined with gaussian uncertainties @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively .",
    "let us indicate with @xmath92 and @xmath93 the true location of the images .",
    "then , we can propagate the uncertainty on the independent variables by marginalizing the likelihood over the angular error distribution .",
    "assuming gaussian errors this gives ( for conciseness we drop the dependence on @xmath81 ) : @xmath94 with @xmath95 where in the integrand we have explicited the dependence of the likelihood @xmath96 on the position of the images .",
    "if the angles are precisely measured , then eq .  ( [ likegauss ] ) tends to a @xmath97-dirac and we recover the standard likelihood expression eq .",
    "( [ likenoerr ] ) .",
    "parameter estimation only provides us with information on the quality of fit of a given model against the data . how do we choose between competing models characterized by different model parameters ?",
    "preference solely based on the goodness - of - fit as measured by the @xmath14 for the best fitting model parameter values leaves us with partial information which is not consistently quantifiable in a probabilistic manner .",
    "even then , how do we discount for the level of predictiveness of different models ? more precisely",
    ", how do we decide whether data justify the choice of a more complex model @xmath98 over one with a smaller number of free parameters @xmath99 , while accounting for the extended prior parameter space of @xmath98 ? as stressed in @xcite , such a question is related to the predictiveness of models rather than ` simplicity / complexity ' , since the former is not necessarily related to the number of free parameters .",
    "parameter estimation does not address these questions , which require a further step already built in the bayesian approach .",
    "central object of the bayesian model selection is the evidence , @xmath100 which gives the probability of the data given the model @xmath81 . using the bayes theorem",
    "we then have the probability of the model @xmath81 given the data , @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the prior belief on the model .",
    "thus , given two competing models , @xmath99 and @xmath98 , we can base our preference on the ratio of the model probabilities given the same set of data @xmath103 where the ratio @xmath104 is the so called `` bayes factor '' of @xmath99 to @xmath98 . supposing we have the same prior belief on the two models , then the bayes factor gives us an estimate of the ratio of the model probabilities given the data .",
    "since the evidence sets up a tension between the quality of fit of a given model and its prior predictiveness , then the bayes factor accounts for the different size of the prior parameter space of the competing models .",
    "bayes factors provide us with a self - consistent probabilistic measure to select a sample of lenses for which the observational data provide strong evidence in favor of a given model description .",
    "for instance , a simple lens model is the isothermal sphere which has no free parameters , @xmath105 . using the bayes factor",
    "we can compare it to a more complex description such as the power - law model with one free parameter @xmath106 .",
    "in such a case we say that @xmath99 is nested in @xmath98 .",
    "similarly , we can compare the power - law model with one free parameter @xmath107 to the case in which a shear field is included with two additional free parameters @xmath108 .",
    "the additional presence of internal shear can be included in a third nested model @xmath109 and confronted against @xmath99 and @xmath98 .",
    "for simplicity , we limit our current analysis to the latter models only .    in order to assess the strength of evidence in favor of a model @xmath99 , against a more complex one , @xmath98",
    ", we use the jeffreys scale  @xcite as reported in  @xcite . to be as conservative as possible , we select lenses for which @xmath110 and exclude those which provide strong evidence in favor of external shear , i.e. @xmath111 .",
    "we also exclude lenses for which we consider the model comparison to be inconclusive @xmath112 .",
    "notice that @xmath113 corresponds to odds of 1 in about 150 in favor of @xmath114 .",
    "the arrival of new data update these odds , further improving our knowledge of the lens system .",
    "in this section we perform a detailed analysis on a synthetic lens catalog to quantify the level of bias on the value of @xmath3 inferred from a bayes factor selected subsample of simulated lenses . to be as conservative as possible we consider lenses in the presence of external shear .",
    "this allows us to test to which extent bayes factors can select those systems for which a simple power - law potential is sufficient to describe the simulated data and consequently evaluate the systematic bias on the inferred value of @xmath3 ."
