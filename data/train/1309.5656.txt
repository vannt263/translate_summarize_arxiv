    "in this work we are concerned with the stationary version of ( [ parabolic2 ] ) below , which reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 has smooth boundary , @xmath3 is the unit outward normal to @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a function with a suitable hypothesis of summability and @xmath6 .",
    "we will concentrate on dirichlet boundary conditions , that is , @xmath7 and navier conditions @xmath8    this type of problems appears in a model of _ epitaxial growth_.    epitaxial growth is characterized by the deposition of new material on existing layers of the same material under high vacuum conditions .",
    "this technique is used in the semiconductor industry for the growth of thin films  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical description of epitaxial growth uses the function @xmath9 which describes the height of the growing interface at the spatial point @xmath10 at time @xmath11 .",
    "a basic modelling assumption is of course that @xmath12 is an univalued function , a fact that holds in a reasonably large number of cases  @xcite . the macroscopic description of the growing interface is given by a partial differential equation for @xmath12 which is usually postulated using phenomenological and symmetry arguments  @xcite .",
    "we will focus on one such an equation that was derived in the context of non - equilibrium surface growth  @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath13 the field @xmath12 evolves in time as dictated by three different terms : linear , nonlinear and non - autonomous ones .",
    "both linear and nonlinear terms describe the dynamics on the interface .",
    "the nonlinear term is the small gradient expansion ( which assumes @xmath14 ) of the gaussian curvature of the graph of @xmath12 .",
    "the linear term is the bilaplacian , that can be considered as the linearized euler - lagrange equation of the willmore functional  @xcite .",
    "this is in fact , see below , the proper interpretation in this context .",
    "finally , the non - autonomous term takes into account the material being deposited on the growing surface .",
    "we can consider this equation as a sort of gaussian curvature flow  @xcite which is stabilized by means of a higher order viscosity term .",
    "the derivation of this equation was actually geometric : it arose as a gradient flow pursuing the minimization of the functional @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mean curvature of the graph of @xmath12 , in the context of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics of surface growth  @xcite .",
    "the actual terms on the right hand side of  ( [ parabolic2 ] ) are found after formally expanding the euler - lagrange equation corresponding to this functional for small values of the different derivatives of @xmath12 and retaining only linear and quadratic terms .",
    "this type of derivation does not rely on a detailed modelling of the processes taking place in a particular physical system . instead ,",
    "because its goal is describing just the large scale properties of the growing interface , it is based on rather general considerations .",
    "this is the usual way of reasoning in this context , in which equations are derived as representatives of universality classes , this is , sets of physical phenomena sharing the same large scales properties  @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "equation  ( [ parabolic2 ] ) has been claimed to be an exact representative of a well known universality class within the realm of non - equilibrium growth  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "frequently used models of epitaxial growth belong to this universality class  @xcite .",
    "we will devote this work to obtain some results on existence and multiplicity of solutions to the fourth order elliptic problem .",
    "one of the main consequences of this work is to exhibit the dependence on the boundary conditions , even in the formulation of the problems .",

    "we formulate some known results on properties of the hessian of a function in the sobolev space @xmath17 , that will be used in the article .",
    "section [ existenceresults ] is devoted to the variational formulation of the problem with dirichlet boundary conditions and proving , via critical points arguments , existence and multiplicity of solutions .",
    "we will use some arguments on minimization and a version by ekeland , in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) of the ambrosetti - rabinowitz _ mountain pass theorem _ ( see @xcite ) .    the navier boundary conditions , as far as we know , have not a variational formulation . in section [ nbc ]",
