    "proliferation of supersonic ( for shear sound ) dislocations was suggested as a possible mechanism of shear melting @xcite .",
    "shear flows in melted complex plasmas and their transport properties , e.g shear viscosity were studied in refs .",
    "one important aspect of shear melting that has not been studied so far is the role of relative angular orientation of the crystal and applied shearing force .    in this work",
    ", we studied the response of a 2d complex plasma crystal to a suddenly applied shear stress .",
