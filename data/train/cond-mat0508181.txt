    "recently , a new sub - discipline of condensed matter physics , spintronics , is emerging rapidly and generating great interests.@xcite the spin current , the most important physical quantity in spintronics , has been extensively studied .",
    "many interesting and fundamental phenomena , such as the spin hall effect@xcite and the spin precession@xcite in systems with spin - orbit coupling , have been discovered and are under further study .    as for the charge current ,",
    "the definition of the local charge current density @xmath4 $ ] and its continuity equation @xmath5 is well - known in physics . here",
    "@xmath6 is the electronic wave function , @xmath7 is the velocity operator , and @xmath8 is the charge density .",
    "this continuity equation is the consequence of charge invariance , i.e. when an electron moves from one place to another , its charge remains the same .",
    "however , in the spin transport , there are still a lot of debates over what is the correct definition for spin current.@xcite the problem stems from that the spin @xmath9 is no invariant quantity in the spin transport , so that the conventional defining of the spin current @xmath10 is no conservative .",
    "recently , some studies have begun investigation in this direction@xcite , e.g. a semi - classical description of the spin continuity equation has been proposed@xcite , as well as studies introducing a conserved spin current under special circumstances.@xcite    in this paper , we study the definition of local spin current density .",
    "we find that due to the spin is vector and it has the translational and rotational motion , one has to use two quantities , the linear spin current and the angular spin current , to completely describe the spin transport . here",
    "the linear spin current describe the translational motion of a spin , and the angular spin current is for the rotational motion .",
    "the conventional linear spin current has been extensively studied .",
    "however , the physical meaning of the angular spin current is given for the first time .",
    "the definition of two spin current densities are given and they appear naturally in the quantum spin continuity equation .",
    "moreover , we predict that the angular spin current can generate an electric field similar as with the linear spin current , and thus contains physical consequences .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we first discuss the flow of a classical vector . the flow of a quantum spin is investigated in section iii . in section iv , we study the problem of electric fields induced by spin currents .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in section v.",
    "before studying the spin current in a quantum system , we first consider the classical case . consider a classical particle having a vector @xmath11 ( e.g. the classical magnetic moment , etc . ) with its magnitude @xmath12 fixed under the particle motion . to completely describe this vector flow ( see fig.1c ) , besides the local vector density @xmath13 one needs two quantities : the linear velocity @xmath14 and the angular velocity @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the particle density , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 describe the translational and rotational motions , respectively ( see fig.1a and b ) .",
    "in contrast with the flow of a scalar quantity in which one only needs one quantity , namely the local velocity @xmath19 , to describe the translational motion , it is essential to use two quantities , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , for the vector flow .",
    "we emphasize that it is impossible to use one vector to describe both translational and rotational motions altogether .",
    "since @xmath12 is a constant , the change of the local vector @xmath20 in the volume element @xmath21 with the time from @xmath22 to @xmath23 can be obtained ( see fig.1c ) : @xmath24 \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\vec{\\omega}({\\bf r},t)\\times \\vec{m}({\\bf r},t ) \\delta v dt.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first and the second terms on the right describe the classical vector flowing in or out the volume element @xmath25 and its rotational motion respectively , and both can cause a change in the local vector density .",
    "when @xmath25 goes to zero , we have the vector continuity equation:@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a tensor , and its element @xmath28 .",
    "notice that this continuity equation is from the kinematics and the invariance of @xmath12 , in particular it is independent of the dynamic laws.@xcite this is completely same with the continuity equation with a scalar quantity ( e.g. charge ) . introducing @xmath29 and @xmath30 , then eq.(2 ) reduces to : @xmath31 here @xmath32 is from the translational motion of the classical vector @xmath11 , and @xmath33 describes its rotational motion.@xcite since @xmath17 and @xmath18 are called as the linear velocity and the angular velocity respectively , it is natural to name @xmath34 and @xmath35 as the linear and the angular current densities .    in order to describe a scalar ( e.g. charge ) flow ,",
    "one local current @xmath36 is sufficient .",
    "why is it required to introduce two quantities instead of one to describe a vector flow ?",
    "the reason is that the scalar quantity only has the translational motion , but the vector quantity has two kinds of motion , the translational and the rotational .",
    "so one has to use two quantities , the velocity @xmath17 and the angular velocity @xmath18 , to describe the motion of a single vector .",
    "correspondingly , two quantities @xmath37 and @xmath33 are necessary to describe the vector flow .    in the steady state case",
    ", the scalar ( e.g. charge ) continuity equation reduces into @xmath38 , so the scalar current @xmath39 is a conserved quantity .",
    "but for a vector flow , the linear vector current @xmath34 is not conserved since @xmath40 . whether it is possible to have a conserved vector current through redefinition ?",
    "of course , this redefined vector current should have a clear physical meaning and is measurable . in our opinion , this is almost impossible in the 3-dimensional space .",
    "the reasons are : ( i ) one can not use a 3-dimensional vector to combine both @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "therefore one can also not use a 3-dimensional tensor to combine both @xmath37 and @xmath33 .",
    "( ii ) consider an example , as shown in fig.3a , a one - dimensional classical vector flowing along the x - axis .",
    "when @xmath41 , the vector s direction is in @xmath42 axis . at @xmath43 ,",
    "the vector rotates in accompany with its translational motion .",
    "when @xmath44 , its direction is along @xmath45 axis .",
    "since for @xmath41 and @xmath44 the vector has no rotational motion , the definition of the vector current is unambiguous , and the non - zero element is @xmath46 for @xmath41 , and @xmath47 for @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the vector current is obviously different for @xmath41 and @xmath44 , and the vector current is non - conservative .    in our opinion ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath33 already have clear physical meanings .",
    "they also completely and sufficiently describe a vector flow .",
    "one may not need need to enforce a conserved current .",
    "in particular , as shown in the example of fig.3a , sometimes it is impossible to introduce a conserved current .",
    "now we study the electronic spin @xmath9 in the quantum case .",
    "consider an arbitrary wave function @xmath6 .",
    "the local spin density @xmath9 at the position @xmath48 and time @xmath22 is : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the pauli matrices .",
    "the time - derivative of @xmath52 is : @xmath53      \\hat{\\vec{\\sigma } } \\psi     + \\psi^{\\dagger } \\hat{\\vec{\\sigma } }      \\frac{d}{dt } \\psi \\right\\}.\\ ] ] from the schrodinger equation , we have @xmath54 and @xmath55^{\\dagger}$ ] .",
    "notice here the transposition in the symbol @xmath56 only acts on the spin indexes . by using the above two equations , the eq.(4 ) changes into : @xmath57/2i.\\ ] ] in the derivation below , we use the following hamiltonian : @xmath58 note that our results are independent of this specific choice of the hamiltonian.@xcite in eq.(6 ) the 1st and 2nd terms are the kinetic energy and potential energy .",
    "the 3rd term is the zeeman energy due to a magnetic field , and the last term is the rashba spin - orbit coupling@xcite , which has been extensively studied recently@xcite .",
    "next we substitute the hamiltonian eq.(6 ) into eq.(5 ) , and the eq.(5 ) reduces to : @xmath59     \\hat{\\vec{\\sigma}}\\psi \\ } \\nonumber\\\\   & + & re\\ { \\psi^{\\dagger } [ \\vec{b }    + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\hbar}\\vec{p}\\times\\hat{z}]\\times\\hat{\\vec{\\sigma } }    \\psi \\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] introducing a tensor @xmath60 and a vector @xmath61 : @xmath62      \\hat{\\vec{s}}\\psi \\}\\\\    \\vec{j}_{\\omega}({\\bf",

    "the two quantities @xmath60 and @xmath71 in eq.(10 ) , which are defined in eqs.(12,13 ) respectively , describe the translational and rotational motion ( precession ) of a spin at the location @xmath48 and the time @xmath22 .",
    "they will be named the linear and the angular spin current densities accordingly@xcite , similar as @xmath17 and @xmath18 are called the linear and the angular velocities .",
    "in fact , the linear spin current @xmath60 is identical with the conventional spin current investigated in recent studies@xcite .",
    "however , we give the physical meaning of @xmath61 for the first time .",
    "next , we discuss certain properties of @xmath72 and @xmath61 .",
    "notice that @xmath71 which describe the rotational motion ( precession ) of the spin plays a parallel role in comparison with the conventional linear spin current @xmath72 for the spin transport .",
    "( 1 ) in similar with the classical case , it is necessary to introduce the two quantities @xmath60 and @xmath61 to completely describe the motion of a quantum spin .",
    "( 2 ) the linear spin current is a tensor .",
    "its element , e.g. @xmath73 , represents an electron moving along the @xmath74 direction with its spin in the @xmath75 direction ( see fig.2a ) .",
    "the angular spin current @xmath35 is a vector . in fig.2b ,",
    "its element @xmath76 describes the rotational motion of the spin in the @xmath75 direction and the angular velocity @xmath77 in the @xmath78 direction .",
    "( 3 ) from the linear spin current density @xmath72 , one can calculate ( or say how much ) the linear spin current @xmath79 flowing through a surface @xmath80 ( see fig.2d ) : @xmath81 .",
    "however , the behavior for the angular spin current is different . from the density @xmath82 ,",
    "it is meaningless to determine how much the angular spin current flowing through a surface @xmath80 , because the angular spin current describes the rotational motion not the movement . on the other hand",
    ", one can calculate the total angular spin current @xmath83 in a volume @xmath84 from @xmath35 : @xmath85 .",
    "( 4 ) it is easy to prove that the spin currents in the present definitions of eqs.(12,13 ) are invariant under a space coordinate transformation as well the gauge transformation .",
    "( 5 ) if the system is in a steady state , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are independent of the time @xmath22 , and @xmath86 .",
    "then the spin continuity equation ( 10 ) reduces to : @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "this means that the total linear spin current flowing out of a closed surface is equal to the total angular spin current enclosed .",
    "if to further consider a quasi one dimensional ( 1d ) system ( see fig.2d ) , then one has @xmath89 .",
    "( 6 ) the linear spin current density @xmath90 gives both the spin direction and the direction of spin movement , so it completely describes the translational motion . however , the angular spin current density , @xmath91 involves the vector product of @xmath92 , not the tensor @xmath93 .",
    "is it correct or sufficient to describe the rotational motion ?",
    "for example , the rotational motion of fig.2b with the spin @xmath9 in the @xmath75 direction and the angular velocity @xmath18 in the @xmath78 direction is different from the one in fig.2c in which @xmath9 is in the @xmath94 direction and @xmath18 is in the @xmath75 direction , but their angular spin currents are completely the same .",
    "shall we distinguish them ?",
    "it turns out that the physical results produced by the above two rotational motions ( fig.2b and 2c ) are indeed the same .",
    "for instance , the induced electric field by them is identical since a spin @xmath9 has only the direction but no size ( see detail discussion below ) .",
    "thus , the vector @xmath35 is sufficient to describe the rotational motion , and no tensor is necessary .",
    "now we give an example of applying the above formulas , eqs.(12,13 ) , to calculate the spin currents .",
    "let us consider a quasi 1d quantum wire having the rashba spin orbit coupling , and its hamiltonian is : @xmath95 + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_r^2}{2 m } , \\ ] ] where @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath97 for @xmath41 and @xmath44 , and @xmath98 while @xmath43 .",
    "the other rashba term @xmath99 is neglected because z - direction is quantized@xcite .",
    "let @xmath100 be a stationary wave function @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the bound state wave function in the confined @xmath75 and @xmath94 directions .",
    "@xmath103 represents the spin motion as shown in fig.3a , in which the spin moves along the @xmath74 axis , as well the spin precession in the @xmath74-@xmath75 plane in the region @xmath43.@xcite using eqs.(12,13 ) , the spin current densities of the wave function @xmath103 are easily obtained .",
    "there are only two non - zero elements of @xmath104 : @xmath105 the non - zero elements of @xmath106 are : @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "those spin current densities confirm with the intuitive picture of an electron motion , precession in the @xmath74-@xmath75 plane in @xmath43 and movement in the @xmath74 direction ( see fig.3a ) .",
    "in particular , in the region of @xmath41 and @xmath44 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is a good quantum number , hence , @xmath111 . in this case",
    ", the definition of the spin current @xmath34 is unambiguous .",
    "however , the spin currents are different in @xmath41 and @xmath44 except for @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ... ) .",
    "this is clearly seen from fig.3a .",
    "therefore , through this example , one can conclude that it is sometimes impossible to define a conserved spin current .",
    "the example of fig.3a indeed exists and has been studied before@xcite .    above discussion",
    "shows that the linear spin current @xmath114 and the angular spin current @xmath115 have clear physical meanings , representing the translational motion and the rotational motion ( precession ) respectively .",
    "they completely describe the flow of a quantum spin .",
    "any physical effects of the spin currents , such as the induced electric field , can be expressed by @xmath34 and @xmath35.@xcite",
    "recently , theoretic studies have suggested that the ( linear ) spin current can induce an electric field @xmath0@xcite . can the angular spin current also induce an electric field ? if so this gives a way of detecting the angular spin current .",
    "following , we study this question by using the method of equivalent magnetic charge@xcite .",
    "let us consider a steady - state angular spin current element @xmath116 at the origin .",
    "associated with the spin @xmath9 , there is a magnetic moment ( mm ) @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the bohr magneton .",
    "thus , corresponding to @xmath35 , there is also a angular mm current @xmath119 . from above discussions , we already know that @xmath120 ( or @xmath35 ) comes from the rotational motion of a mm @xmath11 ( or @xmath9 )",
    "( see fig.2b and 2c ) , and @xmath121 ( or @xmath122 ) . under the method of equivalent magnetic charge ,",
    "the mm @xmath11 is equivalent to two magnetic charges : one with magnetic charge @xmath123 located at @xmath124 and the other with @xmath125 at @xmath126 ( see fig.2e ) .",
    "@xmath127 is the unit vector of @xmath11 and @xmath128 is a tiny length .",
    "the angular mm current @xmath120 is equivalent to two magnetic charge currents : one is @xmath129 at the location @xmath124 , the other is @xmath130 at @xmath126 ( see fig.2e ) , with @xmath131 being the unit vector of @xmath120 and @xmath132 the angle between @xmath18 and @xmath11 . in our previous work,@xcite",
    "we have given the formulae of the electric field induced by a magnetic charge current .",
    "the electric field induced by @xmath133 can be calculated by adding the contributions from the two magnetic charge currents .",
    "let @xmath134 , and note that @xmath135 and @xmath136 , we obtain the electric field @xmath137 generated by an element of the angular spin current @xmath138 : @xmath139 we also rewrite the electric field @xmath140 generated by an element of the linear spin current using the tensor @xmath141:@xcite @xmath142 below we emphasize three points : ( i ) in the large @xmath2 case , the electric field @xmath137 decays as @xmath1 .",
    "note that the field from a linear spin current @xmath140 goes as @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , in terms of generating an electric field , the angular spin current is as effective as a magnetic charge current .",
    "( ii ) in the steady - state case , the total electric field @xmath143 contains the property : @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is an arbitrary close contour not passing through the region of spin current . however , for each @xmath137 or @xmath140 , @xmath146 or @xmath147 can be non - zero . (",
    "iii ) as mentioned above , a angular spin current @xmath35 may consist of different @xmath18 and @xmath9 ( see fig.2b and 2c ) .",
    "however , the resulting electric field only depends on @xmath148 .",
    "this is because a spin vector contains only a direction and a magnitude , but not a spatial size ( i.e. the distance @xmath128 approaches to zero ) . in the limit @xmath149 ,",
    "both magnetic charge currents @xmath150 reduce to @xmath151 at the origin .",
    "therefore , the overall effect of the rotational motion is only related to @xmath152 , not separately on @xmath18 and @xmath11 .",
    "hence it is enough to describe the spin rotational motion by using a vector @xmath153 , instead of a tensor @xmath154 .    due to the fact that the direction of @xmath9 can change during the particle motion , the linear spin",
    "current density @xmath34 is not a conserved quantity .",
    "it is always interesting to uncover a conserved physical quantity from both theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "let us apply @xmath155 acting on two sides of eq.(10 ) , we have : @xmath156 where @xmath157 means that @xmath158 acts on the second index of @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath159 with @xmath160 .",
    "define @xmath161 , the above equation reduces into:@xcite @xmath162 this means that the current @xmath163 of the spin divergence is a conserved quantity in the steady state case .",
    "in fact , @xmath164 represents an equivalent magnetic charge , so @xmath163 can also be named the magnetic charge current density .",
    "moreover , the total electric field produced by @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be rewritten as : @xmath165 so the total electric field @xmath166 only depends on the current @xmath163 of the spin divergence .",
    "note that @xmath166 can be measured experimentally in principle . through the measurement of @xmath167 , @xmath163 can be uniquely obtained .    in the following ,",
    "let us calculate the induced electric fields at the location @xmath168 by the spin currents in the example of fig.3a . substituting the spin currents of eqs.(16 - 19 ) into eqs.(20,21 ) and assuming the transverse sizes of the 1d wire are much smaller than @xmath169 , the induced fields @xmath137 and @xmath140 can be obtained straightforwardly .",
    "then the total electric field @xmath170 is : @xmath171^{3/2 } } dx ' \\nonumber\\\\              & = &             a \\nabla \\int ( \\vec{\\cal{v}}\\times\\vec{\\cal{s}})\\bullet              \\frac{{\\bf r}-{\\bf r'}}{|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r'}|^3 } dx'\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , the constant @xmath175 , and @xmath176 is the linear density of moving electrons under the bias of an external voltage .",
    "the total electric field @xmath166 represents the one generated by a 1d wire of electric dipole moment @xmath177 at the @xmath74 axis ( see fig.3b ) , where @xmath178 is a constant .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath179 , i.e. @xmath144 .",
    "however , in general @xmath146 and @xmath147 are separately non - zero .",
    "finally , we estimate the magnitude of @xmath166 .",
    "we use parameters consistent with realistic experimental samples .",
    "take the rashba parameter @xmath180evm ( corresponding to @xmath181=1/100 nm for @xmath182 ) , @xmath183/m ( i.e. one moving electron per 1000 nm in length ) , and @xmath184/m .",
    "the electric potential difference between the two points a and b ( see fig.3b ) is about @xmath185 , where the positions of a and b are @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "this value of the potential is measurable with today s technology.@xcite furthermore , with the above parameters the electric field @xmath166 at a or b is about @xmath188v / m which is rather large .",
    "in summary , we find that in order to completely describe the spin flow ( including both classic and quantum flows ) , apart from the conventional spin current ( or linear spin current ) , one has to introduce another quantity , the angular spin current .",
    "the angular spin current describes the rotational motion of the spin , and it plays a parallel role in comparison with the conventional linear spin current for the spin translational motion .",
    "moreover we point out that the angular spin current can also induce an electric field and its @xmath137 field scales as @xmath1 at large @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , a conserved quantity , the current @xmath163 of the spin divergence , is discovered , and the total electric field only depends on @xmath163 .",
