    "the force of gravity is believed to be mediated by spin-2 particles called gravitons which are commonly considered as massless . however , initiating with the idea of a spin-2 particle with non - zero rest mass , several approaches have been taken to introduce mass to graviton @xcite . endowing graviton with mass leads to extra degrees of freedom which do not decouple as graviton mass approaches to zero implying that the general relativistic ( gr ) case can not be recovered @xcite .",
    "some of the approaches to massive gravity suffer from pathologies like the presence of ghost mode @xcite , discontinuity when the mass approaches to zero limiting case and so on @xcite , and several theories have been proposed to fix these problems and also attempted to formulate a consistent theory of massive gravity @xcite . at the same time , there have been several attempts to estimate the mass of graviton from astrophysical sources and primordial gravitational waves ( gws ) @xcite .",
    "it is proposed that if graviton mass is comparable to the hubble parameter , then it can provide a repulsive effect at cosmological distances and hence lead to the late time cosmic acceleration , thereby suggesting that the massive gravitons responsible for the current accelerating phase of the universe instead of dark energy .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the lorentz - violating massive gravity theory in which the lorentz invariance is spontaneously broken by a convenient choice of the vacuum for the goldstone fields , and the mass parameters are chosen in such a way that the pathologies are absent , and the scalar and vector modes behave exactly like those in the general relativistic case .",
    "hence , the modification of the gravity comes only from the tensor modes and the dispersion relation of gravitational waves acquires an effective mass and is relativistic @xcite . according to this theory , the bound on the primordial graviton mass comes from the exponential decay in the yukawa potential , putting the upper bound for the graviton mass to be @xmath0 ev @xcite .",
    "the lower bound for graviton mass has been proposed to be @xmath1 ev @xcite .",
    "the small mass of graviton is expected to have an effect on the temperature anisotropy and polarization spectra of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "the imprint of primordial gravitational waves on cmb anisotropy can be observed through the angular power spectrum of cmb in the form of b - mode polarization @xcite .",
    "the observations of b - mode polarization on cmb would not only verify the theory of inflation itself but also help in constraining many inflation models @xcite .",
    "the detection of b - mode polarization of cmb or the primordial gw itself would provide a clear bound on the mass of primordial graviton .",
    "hence , in this paper , we study the effect of the primordial massive gws on the bb mode correlation angular power spectrum of cmb for various inflation models and the results are compared with the recent bicep2/keck array and planck collaboration data @xcite and thereby to obtain constraint on the mass of primordial gravitons .",
    "for massive gravity , the action can be written in terms of the einstein - hilbert action and the goldstone action as @xcite , @xmath2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 characterizes the cutoff energy scale for low energy effective theory .",
    "@xmath4 is a function of the goldstone field , metric components and its derivatives .",
    "the second term in the above action leads to violation of the lorentz symmetry .",
    "it is assumed that ordinary matter field is minimally coupled to the metric .",
    "the argument @xmath5 can be obtained with the help of the following expressions @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , ( @xmath9 ) are the four scalar fields and @xmath10 is considered as a constant free parameter .    for eq.([action ] ) , the vacuum solutions corresponding to the flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the scale factor for the flrw metric and @xmath13 is the flat space metric .    the metric @xmath14 with perturbations can be written as @xmath15 where the metric perturbations @xmath16 are taken after the spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking .",

    "we get the lagrangian as @xmath27 where the mass parameters are given by @xcite , @xmath28 , \\nonumber \\\\ m_1 ^ 2 & = & \\frac{2 \\lambda^4}{m_{pl}^2}[-xf_x -wf_w + \\frac{1}{2}xwf_{vv } ] , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "each of these regions is characterized by certain fine - tuning relations between the mass parameters . in the vector sector , provided @xmath31 , the vector field behaves in the same way as in the einstein theory in the gauge @xmath32 ; hence there are no propagating vector perturbations and gravity is not modified in this sector unless one takes into account the non - linear effects or higher derivative terms @xcite . in the scalar sector , the scalar field has massless limit which coincides with the gr expression ; hence there is no vdvz discontinuity . in the tensor sector , only the transverse - traceless perturbations @xmath22 are present and their field equation is that of a massive field with the mass @xmath33 with helicity-2 ; hence there are two massive spin-2 propagating degrees of freedom .",
