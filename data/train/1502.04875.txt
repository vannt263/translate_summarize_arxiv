    "one of the important tools to study the properties of hot and dense matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is a qcd jet production .",
    "medium - induced energy loss of energetic partons , the so - called jet quenching , is supposed to be very different in cold nuclear matter and in quark - gluon medium , and leads to a number of phenomena which have been already seen in the rhic data on high momentum particle production in gold - gold collisions ( see , e.g. , reviews  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the lhc heavy ion program makes it possible to probe the new frontiers of the high temperature quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) with the increasing role of hard and massive particle production processes .",
    "the effective reconstruction of energetic jets and other hard probes ( like w - boson and b - tagged jets ) at lhc energies becomes possible even in heavy ion environment .",
    "a number of interesting lhc results from pbpb runs at @xmath0 tev , have been published by alice , atlas and cms collaborations ( the overview of the results from the first year of heavy ion physics at lhc can be found in  @xcite ) . in particular , the first direct observation of jet quenching has been done measuring the transverse energy imbalance in dijet  @xcite and photon+jet  @xcite channels .",
    "then jet quenching effect has been manifested by a number of specific phenomena , such as the suppression of inclusive  @xcite and semi - inclusive  @xcite jet rates in central pbpb collisions compared to peripheral events and proton - proton interactions , similar suppression for jets from b - quark fragmentation  @xcite , azimuthal anisotropy of jet spectra  @xcite , and medium - modifed jet internal structure  @xcite ( see  @xcite for some overview ) . at",
    "that a number of theoretical calculations and monte - carlo simulations in many different approaches were attempted to reproduce the jet quenching observables in pbpb collisions at the lhc , and to extract by such a way new information about created medium and partonic energy loss mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "the review of the current status of jet quenching theory can be found e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "single top quark production is a new interesting hard probe of quark gluon matter at the lhc .",
    "top quarks are produced and decay at very early stage of the nuclear reaction before the dense matter formation .",
    "then partonic products of top quark decay loose the energy propagating through the qcd - medium , and so their different kinematic distributions get modified . in particular , smearing and decreasing mean and maximum values of invariant mass distributions of three jets from top quark decay ( one b - jet and two jets from w - boson ) and dijets from w - boson decay in pbpb collisions as compared with pp interactions are predicted for top anti - top pair production  @xcite .",
    "single and pair top - quark production cross sections in proton - lead and lead - lead collisions at the energies of lhc and future circular collider ( fcc ) have been estimated recently in  @xcite with next - to - leading - order perturbative qcd calculations including nuclear parton distribution functions .    in our paper",
    "we analyze the influence of nuclear effects on single top decay pattern in pbpb collisions at nominal lhc energy @xmath1 tev in the frameworks of comphep  @xcite and pyquen  @xcite event generators .",
    "the cross section calculation of single top production process is done with mcfm  @xcite , subsequent generation of nucleon - nucleon events is done with comphep , while pyquen being used to simulate in - medium rescattering and energy loss of top quark partonic decay products .",
    "the neutron and proton content in pb nuclei , and nuclear parton distribution functions have been taken into account .",
    "the medium - induced modification of different characteristics of single top quark decay products ( invariant mass distribution of w - boson and b - jet from top quark decays , the fraction of top quarks observed with associated partner jet , transverse momentum distribution of associated jets ) , and the charge asymmetry of top / anti - top quark yields due to the isospin effect are investigated .",
    "at hadron and lepton colliders top quarks are produced either inpairs or singly .",
    "the representative diagrams for the single top production are shown in fig .",
    "[ diag_lhc ] .",
    "three mechanisms of the single top production are distinguished by the virtuality @xmath2 of the w - boson involved : @xmath3channel ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath5channel ( @xmath6 ) , associated tw ( @xmath7 ) . at lhc energies , most of single top quarks are produced with associated partner jet in @xmath3channel . in our studies",
    "we are taking into account only @xmath3channel , as the most significant one .",
    "we consider three scenarios : ( 1 ) without any nuclear effect ; ( 2 ) with initial state effect ( nuclear shadowing ) ; ( 3 ) with both initial and final ( jet quenching ) state effects .",
    "this notations are used on all the plots and are described in details in this section and table  [ sim_tab ] .",

    "it generates , squares and symbolically calculates a set of feynman diagrams for a given process and creates a numeric monte - carlo generator for the process .",
    "this generator allows one to compute cross sections ( with applied cuts ) , to build distributions and to generate events with partons in the final state ; the initial partons are convoluted with parton distribution functions ( pdf ) . in nucleus - nucleus",
    "aa collisions , the parton flux is enhanced by the number @xmath10 of nucleons in the nucleus and  modulo small ( anti)shadowing effects in the nuclear pdf . in our calculations",
    "we have used mstw2008 pdf  @xcite at nnlo with nuclear corrections pdf eps09  @xcite from lhapdf library  @xcite .",
    "it allowed to take into account nuclear ( anti)shadowing modifications of the bound relative to free nucleons as well as the different isospin ( u- and d - quark ) content of pb ion given by its different proton ( z=82 ) and neutron ( n=126 ) numbers .",
    "the latter effect is important in the case of electroweak isospin - sensitive processes like w , z , prompt photon and single top quark production .",

    "[ sim_tab ] is confirmed in a good agreement with the cms data on w - production cross section and rapidity dependence of @xmath12 charge asymmetry ( fig .",

    "we consider the channel with leptonic ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) top quark decay modes . the possibility to reconstruct w - bosons in pbpb collisions with cms detector using missing-@xmath15 technique has been revealed in  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of b - tagging in pbpb collisions is estimated on the level of @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "thus the reconstruction of top quark in pbpb collisions in the leptonic decay mode looks quite realistic .",
    "the reconstruction of hadronically decayed single top quarks ( @xmath17 ) seems practically impossible even in pp collisions due to huge qcd background .    in order to estimate the expected event rate for realistic geometrical acceptance and kinematic cuts",
    ", the selection requires pseudorapidity coverage @xmath18 for light - flavor quark jets , presence of at least one b - tagged jet with @xmath19 and @xmath19 for leptons ( muons and electrons ) , where @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the criteria corresponds to the conditions of atlas and cms experiments .",
    "the cuts on transverse momenta of leptons @xmath21 gev/@xmath22 and jet transverse energy @xmath23 gev were applied .    for simplicity jet clustering",
    "is done with pycell pythia routine .",
    "cone based criteria @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , is used to associate jet to parton . in single top quark production topology presupposes two hard jets with high @xmath26 , b - jet from top quark decay and light quark jet and one soft jet with low @xmath26 from additional b - quark .",
    "we estimate efficiency of kinematic acceptance as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is number of events passed kinematic cuts , @xmath29 is full number of events generated by monte - carlo , and it is @xmath30 .",
    "b - tagging acceptance is estimated as @xmath31 where @xmath32 are number of events passed kinematic cuts with reconstructed one and two b - jets correspondingly , @xmath33 is b - tagging efficiency . for @xmath34 we can estimate acceptance @xmath35 .",
    "total acceptance as @xmath36    single top t - channel production nlo cross section is calculated with mcfm and is @xmath37 pb . we assume equal branching @xmath38 for muon and electron and total acceptance as @xmath39 .",
    "then the estimated pp cross section for single top quark production in leptonic mode ( electron and muon channels without any contribution from tau - channel ) satisfying above cuts is @xmath40 pb , and pbpb cross section is estimated as @xmath41 .",
    "our numbers are compatible with ones obtained in  @xcite ( taking into account that different nucleon pdf and little different kinematic cuts were used ) .",
    "the corresponding event rate in a one month pbpb run ( @xmath42 seconds ) , with nominal luminosity @xmath43@xmath44s@xmath45 , is estimated as @xmath46 ( this corresponds to @xmath47 integrated luminosity data ) . in the case of increasing lhc luminosity for lead beams in the future ( upgrade plans for hl - lhc ) by a factor of @xmath48 , the number of detected events with single top quark production may increase up to @xmath49 .    the main background sources for single top production in pp collisions are w+jets , @xmath50 pairs and qcd jets  [ @xcite ,  @xcite ] .",
    "it is natural to expect that these processes will still form the main background for single top production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "however their significance can be modified , as well as influence of initial and final state nuclear effects on them may differ .",
    "background modelling and estimation of signal statistical significance is complex and important task , which however goes beyond the current paper topic .",
    "it could become the subject of our future studies .",
    "after specifying initial partonic state from top quark decays with comphep and pythia , event - by - event monte - carlo simulation of medium - induced rescattering and energy loss of jet partons is performed with pyquen event generator  @xcite .",
    "this model is constructed as a modification of an event obtained with the pythia .",
    "the approach describing the multiple scattering of hard partons is based on accumulated energy loss via gluon radiation which is associated with each parton scattering in expanding quark - gluon fluid .",
    "it also includes the interference effect in gluon emission with a finite formation time using the modified radiation spectrum as a function of the decreasing temperature .",
    "the model takes into account radiative and collisional energy loss of hard partons in longitudinally expanding quark - gluon fluid , as well as the realistic nuclear geometry .",
    "the event - by - event simulation procedure in pyquen includes the generation of initial parton spectra with pythia and production vertexes at the given impact parameter of aa collision ; the rescattering - by - rescattering simulation of the parton path in a dense nuclear overlapping zone inducing its radiative and collisional energy loss ; and the final hadronization according to the lund string model for hard partons and in - medium emitted gluons .",
    "the strength of partonic energy loss in pyquen is determined mainly by the initial maximal temperature @xmath51 of hot fireball in central pbpb collisions , which is achieved in the center of nuclear overlapping area at mid - rapidity .",
    "the transverse energy density in each point inside the nuclear overlapping zone is supposed to be proportional to the impact - parameter dependent product of two nuclear thickness functions @xmath52 in this point , @xmath53 ( here @xmath54 are the transverse distances between the centres of colliding nuclei and the parton production vertex ) .",
    "the rapidity dependent spreading of the initial energy density around mid - rapidity @xmath55 is taken in the gaussian - like form .",
    "the radiative energy loss in the model roughly are proportional to @xmath56 , and collisional loss roughly are proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "such strong dependence of jet quehcning effect on an initial temperature allows us to fix this model parameter within the experimental constraints on jet quenching data .",
    "the partonic energy loss in the model depends also on the proper time @xmath58 of matter formation and the number @xmath59 of active flavors in the medium .",
    "the variation of @xmath58 value within its reasonable range has rather moderate influence on the strength of partonic energy loss .",
    "the jet quenching gets stronger at larger @xmath58 due to slower medium cooling , which implies the jet partons spending more time in the hottest regions , and as a result the rescattering intensity gets stronger  @xcite . increasing @xmath59 result in larger energy loss due to the extension of medium density in this case .",
    "the parameter values @xmath60 gev , @xmath61 @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( gluon - dominated plasma ) , and also the `` wide - angle '' parametrization of medium - induced gluon radiation were used for current investigation .",
    "pyquen with such settings ( just with @xmath64 gev ) reproduces the lhc data on the dijet asymmetry  @xcite , charged particle nuclear modification factor ( up to @xmath65 gev/@xmath22 )  @xcite , jet fragmentation function and jet shapes  @xcite in pbpb collisions at @xmath66  tev .",
    "figure  [ m_j_t ] shows the invariant mass distributions of w - boson and b - jet from top quark decays in minimum bias ( integrated over all impact parameters ) pbpb interactions and pp collisions at @xmath1 tev . the smearing and decreasing mean and maximum values of this distribution from top quark mass",
    "are shown in pbpb events relatively to pp collisions .",
    "transverse momentum spectra of jets associated with top quark is presented in figure  [ jet_b_t_pt ] .",
    "significant softening of this distribution and peak shifting from the half mass of w - boson is seen for pbpb collisions .",
    "softening of jet from light quark is also observed in figure  [ jet_l_q_pt ] and its pseudorapidity modification is seen on figure  [ jet_q_eta ] .",
    "one expects that any lepton kinematic distributions are not practically affected by the nuclear medium . however , the distribution on the angle taken in the top rest frame between the lepton from the top decay and the momentum of the light jet produced in association with the top is slightly affected due to jet quenching of all the jets not only from the top decay . the distribution on this important variable for separating the single top signal from backgrounds is shown in the figure  [ cos_lj ] .",
    "another interesting ( initial state ) nuclear effect , which is not directly related to quark - gluon matter formation but reflects the neutron and proton content in pb nuclei , is significant decrease in ratio of top to anti - top quarks cross sections in pbpb with respect to pp collisions at the same beam energy per nucleon pair .",
    "the predicted ratios of @xmath67 yields for minimum bias pbpb events and pp collisions at @xmath1 tev are @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively .",
    "dependence of these ratios from lepton @xmath70 is shown on the figure  [ tt_ratio_asym ] .",
    "the same effect leads to the disappearance of charge asymmetry in pbpb collisions ( fig .",
    "[ tt_charge_asym ] ) .",
    "the t - channel single top production in pbpb collisions at nominal lhc energy @xmath1 tev has been analyzed in the frameworks of mcfm(calculation of cross sections ) , comphep ( generation of events ) , pythia ( parton showering and hadronization ) and pyquen ( medium - induced partonic rescattering and energy loss ) monte - carlo models .",
    "the neutron and proton content in pb nuclei , and nuclear parton distribution functions have been taken into account .",
    "single top quark production has a large enough cross section and visible event rate for the nominal lhc luminosities and is open to study in pbpb collisions .",
    "medium - induced partonic energy loss can result in the modification of different characteristics of single top quark decay products in pbpb collisions as compared with pp interactions .",
    "we predict smearing and decreasing mean and maximum values of the invariant mass distribution of w - boson and b - jet from top quark decays , significant softening the transverse momentum spectrum of jets associated with top quark and shifting its peak from the half mass of w - boson .",
    "distribution on the angle taken in the top rest frame between the lepton from the top decay and the momentum of jet from light quark produced in association with the top is only slightly affected and may be used for separation single top signal from backgrounds in future .",
