    ". performing studies in magnetic fields tilted in respect to the qw plane opens new possibilities in comparison to bulk structures because the perpendicular field component , @xmath1 , affects mostly orbital motion while the in - plane magnetic field , @xmath2 , couples only with the carrier spins .",

    "@xcite    in semiconductor qws , positive magnetoresistance measurements in a field perpendicular to the 2d structure has been first reported a decade ago .",
    "@xcite however attempts to describe the data by the old theory  @xcite failed .",
    "the reason was in the nature of spin - orbit interaction in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "it has the form of odd in the 2d wavevector spin - dependent terms in the hamiltonian that are caused by structure inversion asymmetry ( the rashba term ) and by the bulk or interface inversion asymmetry ( the dresselhaus term ) .",
    "a new theory taking into account both rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions has been developed in ref .  .",
    "it has been shown that effect of the spin - orbit interaction on weak localization does not reduced to only spin relaxation but also manifests itself as a spin precession in the effective magnetic field caused by rashba or dresselhaus terms .",
    "the correct expressions for the anomalous magnetoresistance have been derived .",
    "this allowed to describe successfully the experimental data of ref .   and reliably extract the spin - orbit , spin - relaxation and dephasing parameters .",
    "@xcite soon afterwards the new experiments have been performed and the results occurred to be in excellent agreement with the new theory .",
    "@xcite similar studies have been performed during all the recent decade allowing to investigate the carrier spin properties in 2d systems hitherto .     in a magnetic field parallel to qw interfaces , the anomalous magnetoresistance also takes place due to weak localization effects .",
