    "attractive truncated coulomb potentials @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a truncation parameter @xmath5 are of special physical interest .",
    "they avoid the singularity at @xmath6 ( the crux of divergence problems ) and serve as models for many interesting physical phenomena [ 1 - 10].for the case @xmath7 , eq.(1 ) reads @xmath8 the eminent cutoff coulomb potential . in quantum - field theory , it has been suggested that if gravitational interactions of elementary particles are taken into account , there would be a gravitational cut off of coulomb interactions resulting in a finite theory of quantum field .",
    "eq.(2 ) represents therefore a nonrelativistic version of this idea .",
    "it may , moreover , be considered as an approximation of the potential of a smeared charge rather than a point charge.when @xmath9 , eq.(1 ) implies @xmath10 often called the laser - dressed coulomb potential . a model that has been found useful for the study of the spectrum of a laser - dressed hydrogen - like atoms when exposed to an intensive non - resonant laser - field [ 5 - 10 ] .",
    "it has been shown that under kramers - henneberger canonical transformations the potential of such atoms can be recast into ( 3 ) with the truncation parameter @xmath4 is related to the strength of the irradiating laser field [ 7 - 9 ] .",
    "the effective potential for scattering by a uniform spherical charge distribution is well simulated by ( 3 ) .",
    "moreover , it is very similar to the modified potential of the nucleus of a muonic atom due to finiteness in its size [ 5,11 - 15 ] .    as the schrdinger equation for neither of the potentials is amenable to a general analytic solution",
    ", one has to retain perturbation techniques or numerical methods to analyze their bound states .",
    "mehta and patil [ 2 ] had investigated analytically the s - state energy for the potential ( 2 ) ; however , no numerical results were obtained .",
    "intensive analysis had been carried out by de meyer and vanden berghe [ 3 ] and fernandeze [ 4 ] on the bound states of ( 2 ) .",
    "the shifted 1/n expansion technique had been employed to calculate the energy eigenvalues of potential ( 3 ) [ 6 ] .",
    "david singh et al [ 5 ] have employed a numerical method to calculate the energy eigenvalues for the potentials ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . as such , these potentials are good candidates to be analyzed through an analytical ( often semi - analytical ) technique to resolve their underlying physical aspects .",
    "recently , we have introduced a pseudoperturbative shifted-@xmath0 ( @xmath0 is the angular momentum quantum number ) expansion technique ( pslet ) to solve for nodeless states of schrdinger equation .",
    "it simply consists of using @xmath11 as a pseudoperturbation parameter , where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is a suitable shift .",
    "the shift @xmath13 is vital for it removes the poles that would emerge , at lowest orbital states with @xmath14 , in our proposed expansion below .",
    "our new analytical , often semi - analytical , methodical proposal pslet has been successfully applied to quasi - relativistic harmonic oscillator [ 16 ] , spiked harmonic oscillator [ 17 ] , anharmonic oscillators [ 18 ] , and two dimensional hydrogenic atom in an arbitrary magnetic field[19 ] .    encouraged by its satisfactory performance in handling nodeless states , we generalize pslet recipe ( in section 2 ) for states with arbitrary number of nodal zeros , @xmath15 . in section 3",
    "we apply pslet to treat the potentials ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) and we compare the results obtained by pslet with the exact ones .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "the prescription of our technique starts with the radial part of the time - independent schrdinger equation in h-.2em.2em@xmath16 units , @xmath17 \\psi _ { n_{r},l}(r)=e_{n_{r},l}\\psi _ { n_{r},l}(r).\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the angular momentum quantum number , @xmath18 counts the nodal zeros and @xmath19 is an arbitrary spherically symmetric potential that supports bounded states .",
    "most textbook perturbation techniques manipulate the potential term to introduce a perturbating expansion parameter . to the contrary",
    ", our method keeps the potential arbitrary to the condition of being well - behaved .",
    "we invest the centrifugal term to play this role .",
    "thus , with @xmath12 ( @xmath13 to be determined in the sequel ) , eq.(4 ) reads @xmath20 apparently , the natural limit of eq.(5 ) is the large-@xmath0 limit . at that limit",
    "the centrifugal term dominates over the kinetic energy and the potential terms .",
    "this results in a semiclassical motion of the particle in an effective potential @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a constant that scales the potential at large-@xmath0 limit and is set , for any specific choice of @xmath0 and @xmath23 equal to @xmath24 at the end of calculations[19,20].hence , the motion is concentrated about the minimum of @xmath25 , say @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , a coordinate transformation through @xmath27 will be in point .",
    "it worths mentioning that the scaled coordinates , eq.(6 ) , has no effect on the energy eigenvalues , which are coordinates independent .",
    "it just facilitates the calculations of both the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . performing the coordinate transformation , eq.(6 ) , eq .",

    "it is also convenient to expand @xmath35 as@xmath36 equation ( 7 ) thus becomes@xmath28 \\psi _ { n_{r},l}(x)=r_{0}^{2}\\left ( \\sum_{n=-2}^{\\infty } e_{n_{r},l}^{(n)}\\bar{l}^{-(n+1)}\\right ) \\psi _ { n_{r},l}(x),\\ ] ] with@xmath37 + \\bar{l}^{1/2}\\left [ -x+\\frac{v^{^{\\prime } } ( r_{o})r_{o}^{3}x}{q}\\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left [ \\frac{3}{2}x^{2}+\\frac{v^{^{\\prime \\prime } } ( r_{o})r_{o}^{4}x^{2}}{2q}\\right ] + ( 2\\beta + 1)\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } ( -1)^{n}\\frac{(n+1)}{2}x^{n}\\bar{l}^{-n/2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & r_{o}^{2}\\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty } \\left [ ( -1)^{n}\\frac{(n+1)}{2r_{o}^{2}}x^{n}+\\left ( \\frac{d^{n}v(r_{o})}{dr_{o}^{n}}\\right ) \\frac{(r_{o}x)^{n}}{n!q}\\right ] \\bar{l}^{-(n-2)/2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\beta ( \\beta + 1)\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } ( -1)^{n}\\frac{(n+1)}{2}x^{n}\\bar{l}^{-(n+2)/2}+\\frac{(2\\beta + 1)}{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime of @xmath38 denotes derivative with respect to @xmath39 .",

    "it should be noted that energy term @xmath54 is the energy of a particle moving under the effect of @xmath25 .",
    "hence , it is , roughly , the energy of a classical particle with angular momentum @xmath55=@xmath56 executing circular motion of radius @xmath39 in the potential @xmath38 .",
    "this term thus identifies the leading - order approximation , to all eigenvalues , as a classical approximation and the higher - order corrections as quantum fluctuations around the minimum @xmath39 , organized in inverse powers of @xmath56 .",
    "the next leading correction to the energy series , @xmath57 , consists of a constant term and the exact eigenvalues of the unperturbed harmonic oscillator potential @xmath58 .",
    "the shifting parameter @xmath13 is determined by choosing @xmath57=0 .",
    "this choice is physically motivated .",
    "it requires not only the agreements between pslet eigenvalues and the exact known ones for the harmonic oscillator and coulomb potentials but also between the eigenfunctions as well .",

    "however , because of the limited capabilities of slnt in handling large -order corrections via the standard rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory , only low - order corrections have been reported , sacrificing in effect its preciseness .",
    "therefore , one should seek for an alternative and proceed by setting the wave functions with any number of nodes as    @xmath68    eq.(31 ) is readily transformed into the following riccati type equation @xmath69 + f_{n_{r},l}(x){\\huge \\{}-\\dfrac{1}{2}{\\huge [ } u_{n_{r},l}^{^{^{\\prime \\prime } } } ( x)+(u_{n_{r},l}^{^{\\prime } } ( x))^{2}{\\huge ] } \\\\   \\\\   + \\dfrac{1}{2}(2\\beta + 1)+\\dfrac{1}{2}\\omega ^{2}x^{2}+\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } v^{(n)}(x)\\bar{l}^{-n/2}{\\huge \\}}=r_{0}^{2}f_{n_{r},l}(x)\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } e_{n_{r},l}^{(n-1)}\\bar{l}^{-n } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where primes denotes derivatives with respect to @xmath70.it is evident that ( 33 ) admits solutions of the form    @xmath71    @xmath72    where@xmath73 @xmath74 clearly the nodal zeros of the wavefunctions are taken care of by @xmath75 . for nodeless states ,",
    "@xmath76    which reduces ( 33 ) to the problem described in our previous work for nodeless states[16 - 19 ] . to illustrate how our method works for nodal states",

    "@xmath80    @xmath81    @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84    .... and so on .",
    "obviously , one can calculate the energy eigenvalue and eigenfunctions from the knowledge of @xmath85 and @xmath86 in a hierarchical manner .",
    "nevertheless , the procedure just described is suitable for a software package such as maple to determine the energy eigenvalue and eigenfunction up to any order of the pseudoperturbation series .",
    "although the energy series eq.(11 ) , could appear divergent , or at best , asymptotic for small @xmath87 one can still calculate the eigen series to a very good accuracy by performing the sophisticated [ n , m ] pade approximation[22 ] ,    @xmath88 to the energy series , eq(11 ) .",
    "the energy series , eq(11 ) , is calculated up to @xmath89 by @xmath90 and with the @xmath91 pade approximant it becomes @xmath92=\\bar{l}^{2}e_{n_{r},l}^{(-2)}+p_{4}^{4}(1/\\bar{l}).\\ ] ] our technique is therefore well prescribed .",
    "in this section we consider the truncated coulomb potentials , eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) .    substituting eq.(2 ) into eq.(25 ) , one gets @xmath93 eq.(23 ) together with eq.(24 ) give then @xmath94 = \\dfrac{r_{0}^{3/2}}{(r_{0}+\\alpha ) } \\ ] ] when substituting eq.(3 ) into eq.(25 ) , one gets @xmath95 eq.(23 ) in turn gives @xmath96 = \\dfrac{r_{0}^{2}}{(r_{0}+\\alpha ) ^{3/4}}\\ ] ] eqs.(50 ) and ( 52 ) are explicit equations in @xmath26 . clearly , closed - form solutions of eqs.(49)-(51 ) for @xmath26 are hard to be found ( which is often the case ) .",
    "thus , we use numerical methods to resolve the issue ( hence the notion that pslet is often semianalytical ) .",
    "once @xmath26 is determined the coefficients @xmath97 are determined in a sequential manner .",
    "hence the eigenvalues , eq.(47 ) , and eigenfunctions eqs.(34)-(37 ) , are calculated in the same batch for each value of @xmath98 and @xmath4 .",
    "tables 1 and 2 show pslet results , eq.(47 ) , @xmath99 , for @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 eigenstates of eq.(1 ) , covering week , intermadiate and strong ranges of the truncation parameter @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , we display the pade approximants , eq .",
    "( 48 ) , @xmath107 $ ] , and the exact results , @xmath108 , obtained by direct numerical integration [ 5 ] . comparing @xmath99 with @xmath108 , one notices the underlying relation between the accuracy of pslet results and @xmath0 , @xmath109 and the truncation parameter , @xmath4",
    ". the accuracy of pslet results increases with increasing @xmath0 and/or @xmath109 (  see figure ( 2 ) ) .",
    "this is in accordance with our choice for the expansion parameter in eq.(47 ) , as @xmath11 gets smaller as @xmath0 and/or @xmath109 increases .",
    "pslet results show a good converging trend to the exact values as the truncation parameter gets larger ( see figure ( 1 ) ) . in the strong range of @xmath4 ,",
    "pslet results are almost exact . to resume the eigenenergy  series , eq .",
    "( 47 ) , pade approximant is calculated .",
    "moreover , the stability noticed in different order pade approximants show that the results are accurate up to ten digits at strong range of @xmath4 , to the contrary of the of the results obtained in [ 5 ] where the accuracy is recorded up to eight digits in the same range .     table 3 displays pslet results , @xmath99 , for some excited states of eq.(3 )  along with the pade approximants , @xmath107,$ ] of @xmath99 , the results obtained by slnt[6 ] , @xmath110  and the exact results , @xmath108 , obtained by direct numerical integration [ 5 ] .",
    "apparently , the accuracy of our results for this potential have similar behavior as in the previous case .",
    "when compared with the results obtained by slnt , our results show a better agreement with the exact ones .",
    "the difficulty in calculating high order corrections in slnt through rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory results in loss in accuracy .",
    "pslet makes it amenable to calculate high order corrections which improves the accuracy .",
    "moreover , one notices that the results of pslet are more accurate in the case of the truncated coulomb potential than that of the laser - dressed one .",
    "the reason behind this is that the truncated potential is more coulombic in nature which makes pslet nearer to the exact results .",
    "we have presented a generalization of our pseudoperturbative shifted - @xmath0 expansion technique pslet [ 16 - 19 ] to treat states with arbitrary number of nodal zeros , @xmath111 two truncated coulombic potentials have been treated via pslet and very accurate energy eigenvalues are obtained .      it avoids troublesome questions as those pertaining to the nature of small parameter expansions , the trend of convergence to the exact numerical values ( marked in tables 1 - 3 ) , the utility in calculating the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in one batch to sufficiently higher orders , and the applicability to a wide range of potentials .",
    "moreover , beyond its promise as being quite handy , on computational and practical methodical sides , it offers a useful perturbation prescription where the zeroth- order approximation inherits a substantial amount of the total energy .",
    "finally , the scope of pslet applicability extends beyond the present truncated coulombic potentials .",
    "it could be applied to angular momentum states of multi - electron atoms [ 23 - 25 ] , relativistic and non relativistic quark - antiquark models [ 26 ] , etc .",
    "we believe that the feature of our method in determining expressions for the bound - state wavefunctions makes it possible to describe electron transitions and multiphoton emission occurring in atomic systems in the presence of an intense laser field .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to re - examine such phenomena in the frame work of pslet .",
