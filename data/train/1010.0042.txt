    "it is well established that a superconducting phase difference of @xmath2 can be arranged between two @xmath3-wave superconductors ( ss ) when separating them by a suitably chosen ferromagnetic metals ( fms )  @xcite .",
    "transitions between the @xmath2-state and the 0-state of such s / fm / s josephson junctions have been revealed in experiments through oscillations of the josephson critical current @xmath4 with varying thickness of the fm  @xcite or with varying temperature  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 josephson junction is currently of considerable interest as an element complementary to the usual josephson junction in the development of functional nano - structures including superconducting electronics  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath5 qubits consisting of a s / fm / s @xmath2 junction have been theoretically proposed  @xcite . in the quiet qubits ,",
    "a quantum two level system is spontaneously generated and therefore it is expected to be robust to the decoherence by the fluctuation of the external magnetic field . from the viewpoint of the quantum decoherence , however , s / fm / s junctions is inherently identical with s / nm / s junctions , where nm is a nonmagnetic normal - metal .",
    "therefore a gapless quasiparticle excitation in the fm region is inevitable .",
    "this feature gives a strong ohmic dissipation  @xcite and the coherence time of s / fm / s quiet qubits is bound to be very short .",
    "thus the realization of the @xmath2 junction @xmath6 using such metallic ferromagnets are highly desired for qubit applications  @xcite .    on the other hand , recently , we have developed a numerical method to calculate the josephson current by taking into account the band structure of ferromagnetic materials based on the recursive green s function method  @xcite . by use of this method , we numerically found the formation of the @xmath2-state for the @xmath3-wave junction through a ferromagnetic oxide ( fos ) which is a kind of ferromagnetic insulators .",
    "moreover we have found that the 0-@xmath2 transition is induced by increasing the thickness of the oxide layer  @xcite .",
    "heretofore , however , we have only considered the josephson transport at the very low temperature regime , i.e. , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the superconductor transition temperature . in this paper",
    "we will investigate the @xmath9-temperature josephson transport and show that the 0-@xmath2 phase transition can be realized by increasing the @xmath10 .",

    "the exchange splitting @xmath13 is estimated to be 0.34 ev by a first - principle band calculation using the spin - polarized local density approximation  @xcite .",
    "since the exchange splitting @xmath13 is large and the bands are originally half - filled , the system becomes the ferromagnetic insulator . in the next section ,",
    "we calculate the josephson current through such oxide films numerically .",
    "in this section , we outline a numerical calculation method for the josephson current of s / fo / s junctions based on the recursive green s function technique  @xcite .",

    "the hopping integral @xmath35 is considered among nearest neighbor sites and we choose @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the amplitude of the pair potential in the @xmath3-wave symmetry channel , and @xmath38 is a pauli matrix .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ferromagnetic oxide film is given by a single - band tight - binding model as @xmath39 where @xmath13 is the exchange splitting between the up and down spin band .",

    "we calculate the matsubara green function in a ferromagnetic oxide , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the matsubara frequency , @xmath47 is an integer number , and @xmath48 is a temperature .",

    "we find that the atomic - scale 0-@xmath2 phase transition is induced by increasing the thickness of fo layer  @xcite .",
