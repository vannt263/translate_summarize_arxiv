    "superconductivity in the iron - based pnictide lafeaso doped with fluorine discovered by hosono s group@xcite and subsequent increase of the transition temperature ( @xmath0 ) in the same family of compounds are remarkable as the first non - copper compound that has @xmath0 s exceeding 50 k.@xcite theoretical studies have shown that the electron - phonon coupling is too weak to account for the high @xmath0@xcite , and exploring electronic pairing mechanisms has become a challenge .",
    "fig.1 anion height measured from the cation plane in the iron pnictides ( top ) and the cuprates ( bottom ) .",
    "[ fig1 ]    an interesting observation of this series of material is their strong material dependence of superconductivity . @xmath0",
    "ranges from 5k in lafepo@xcite to 55k@xcite in smfeaso , where the importance of the lattice structure has been pointed out@xcite .",
    "a number of experiments on arsenides suggest fully - open superconducting gap , consistent with the proposal of sign reversing @xmath4-wave pairing , @xcite but experiments have shown presence of nodes in the superconducting gap of lafepo@xcite , suggesting that even the gap is material dependent .",
    "the strong material dependence of superconductivity in the pnictides reminds us of the high @xmath0 cuprates , which also exhibit strong material dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 varies with the number of layers per unit cell , but an even more basic issue is the significant difference in @xmath0 within the _ single - layered _",
    "materials , i.e. , la@xmath5(sr / ba)@xmath6cuo@xmath7 with a maximum @xmath0 of about 40k versus hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath8 with a @xmath9k .",
    "phenomenologically , it has been recognized that the materials with @xmath10k tend to have `` round '' fermi surfaces , while the fermi surface of the `` low @xmath0 '' la system is closer to a square shape which implies a relatively better nesting@xcite .",
    "conventionally , the cuprates with a rounded fermi surface have been modeled by a _",
    "single - band _ model with large second ( @xmath11 ) and third ( @xmath12 ) neighbor hopping integrals ( @xmath13 ) , while the la system has been considered to have smaller @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this , however , has brought about a contradiction between theories and experiments .",
    "namely , while some phenomenological@xcite and @xmath16-@xmath17 model@xcite studies give a tendency consistent with the experiments , a number of many - body approaches for the _ hubbard - type _ models with realistic values of on - site @xmath18 show suppression of superconductivity for large @xmath19 and/or @xmath20@xcite .    in this paper , we show that the experimentally observed material / lattice structure dependence of superconductivity in both pnictides@xcite and cuprates@xcite can be understood by analyzing the superconductivity within the spin fluctuation pairing theory that takes into account the realistic band structure .",
    "a surprising finding is that not only the pnictides , but also the cuprates have band structures where _ multiple _ @xmath21 orbitals play an important role .",
    "interestingly , in both families , the anion height measured from the cation plane ( fig.1 ) turns out to be one of the key parameters that controls the multiorbital band structure and thus the superconductivity .",
    "these studies show that a combination of effective model construction based on first principles band calculation and the application of many body theory can give a realistic description on the material dependence of superconductivity in correlated systems .",
    "we start with the band structure of lafeaso .",
    "lafeaso has a layered structure , where fe atoms form a square lattice in each layer , which is sandwiched by as atoms . due to the tetrahedral coordination of as atoms",
    ", there are two fe atoms per unit cell .",
    "the experimentally determined lattice constants are @xmath22  and @xmath23 , with two internal coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25.@xcite we have first obtained the band structure with plane - wave basis@xcite , which is then used to construct the maximally localized wannier functions@xcite .",
    "these wannier functions have five orbital symmetries ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 refer to those for this unit cell with two fe sites as shown in fig.2(a ) .",
    "the two wannier orbitals in each unit cell are equivalent in that each fe atom has the same local arrangement of other atoms .",
    "we can then take a unit cell that contains only one orbital per symmetry by unfolding the brillouin zone , and we end up with an effective five - band model on a square lattice , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 axes are rotated by 45 degrees from @xmath34-@xmath35 .",
    "we refer all the wave vectors in the unfolded brillouin zone hereafter .",
    "we define the band filling @xmath36 as the number of electrons / number of sites ( e.g. , @xmath37 for full filling ) .",
    "the doping level @xmath32 in lafeaso@xmath38f@xmath6 is related to the band filling as @xmath39 .",
    "fig.2 ( a ) the original ( dashed lines ) and reduced ( solid ) unit cells with @xmath40 ( fe ) , @xmath41 ( as below the fe plane ) and @xmath42 ( above fe ) .",
    "( b ) the band structure ( left ) of the five - band model for lafeaso , and the fermi surface ( right ) at @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "the main orbital characters of some portions of the bands and the fermi surface are indicated .",
    "the dashed horizontal line in the band structure indicates the fermi level for @xmath44 .",
    "the short arrow in the band structure indicates the position of the dirac cone closest to the fermi level .",
    "the gray areas in the fermi surface around the zone corners represent the @xmath45 fermi surface .",
    "( c ) the portion of the band that has mainly the @xmath29 ( solid red ) and @xmath46 ( dashed blue ) orbital character .",
    "[ fig2 ]    the five bands are heavily entangled as shown in fig.2(b ) ( left ) reflecting strong hybridization of the five @xmath47 orbitals , which suggests that the minimal model for the pnictides should include all the five orbitals . in fig.2(b ) ( right ) , the fermi surface for @xmath44 ( corresponding to @xmath48 ) obtained by ignoring the inter - layer hoppings is shown in the two - dimensional unfolded brillouin zone .",
    "the fermi surface consists of four pieces : two concentric hole pockets ( denoted here as @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) centered around @xmath51 , two electron pockets around @xmath52 @xmath53 or @xmath54 @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "@xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) corresponds to the fermi surface around the @xmath58z line ( ma in the original brillouin zone ) in the first - principles band calculation.@xcite besides these pieces of the fermi surface , there is a portion of the band near @xmath59 that touches the @xmath60 , so that the portion acts as a `` quasi fermi surface @xmath61 '' around @xmath59 , which has in fact an important contribution to the spin susceptibility as we shall see below . as for the orbital character , @xmath62 and portions of @xmath63 near brillouin zone edge have mainly @xmath27 and @xmath28 character , while the portions of @xmath63 away from the brillouin zone edge and @xmath45 have mainly @xmath29 orbital character ( see also fig.2(c ) ) .    to be more precise ,",
    "the above band structure is sensitive to the lattice structure . in the upper two panels of fig.3",
    ", we compare the band structure of lafepo and ndfeaso .",
    "a large difference between the two materials lies in the band structure near the wave vector @xmath59 . in lafepo",
    ", the @xmath45 fermi surface originating from the @xmath29 band around @xmath59 largely sinks below the fermi level , and in turn the @xmath46 band , which is not effective for superconductivity , rises up . on the other hand , in ndfeaso ,",
    "the @xmath29 band rises up even more than in lafeaso .",
    "the origin of this band structure variation is mainly due to the variation of the pnictogen height @xmath64 @xcite , which varies from @xmath65 in lafepo to @xmath66 in ndfeaso.@xcite in fact , in the lower two panels of fig.3 , we show band structures of lafeaso with hypothetical lattice structures , where we fix the lattice constants and change only the height to those of ndfeaso or lafepo .",
    "we can see that the band structure around @xmath59 , namely , the position of the @xmath29 and @xmath46 bands are determined by the pnictogen height .",
    "the origin of this height sensitivity of the band structure is the following . in fig.2(c ) , we plot the @xmath29 and @xmath46 portions of the bands . around @xmath59 , the lower portion of @xmath29 and",
    "the upper portion of @xmath46 lies close to the @xmath60 .",
    "when the pnictogen height becomes low , the wannier orbitals widely spread toward the pnictogen , so that the band width tends to become large .",
    "therefore , the @xmath29 portion around @xmath59 sinks below @xmath60 , while the @xmath46 portion rises up .",
    "fig.3 from top to bottom : the band structure and the fermi surfaces of ndfeaso , lafepo , hypothetical structure of lafeaso with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "[ fig3 ]      in contrast to the pnictides , theoretical studies on cuprates has mostly been done for single band models , or the three band model that takes into account the oxygen orbitals that strongly hybridizes with the cu @xmath2 orbital . as mentioned in the introduction , within these single orbital approaches ,",
    "it is difficult to understand the experimental observation that the more fermi surface is rounded , higher the @xmath0 . to resolve the discrepancy between experimental observations and theory",
    ", we consider a _ two - orbital _ model , where we take into account the @xmath1 orbital on top of the @xmath2@xcite .",
    "in fact , for the la system , it has long been known that a band with a strong @xmath1 character lies rather close to the fermi energy@xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been discussed in refs.@xcite that the shape of the fermi surface is determined by the energy level of the `` axial state '' consisting of a mixture of cu @xmath1-o @xmath69 and cu @xmath70 orbitals , and that the strength of the @xmath1 contribution causes the difference in the fermi surface shape between the la and hg systems .",
    "namely , the @xmath1 contribution is large in the la system making the fermi surface closer to a square , while the contribution is small in the hg system making the fermi surface more rounded . in fig.4",
    ", we show the first - principles@xcite result for band structures in the two - orbital model for the la and hg systems , obtained by constructing maximally localized wannier orbitals@xcite .",
    "the lattice parameters adopted here are experimentally determined ones for the doped materials@xcite .",
    "we can confirm that in the la system the main band ( usually considered as the `` @xmath2 band '' ) has in fact a strong @xmath1 character on the fermi surface near the n point , which corresponds to the wave vectors @xmath71 in the brillouin zone of the square lattice .",
    "the @xmath1 contribution is seen to `` push up '' the van hove singularity ( vhs ) of the main band , resulting in a seemingly well nested ( square shaped ) fermi surface . in the hg system ,",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath1 band stays well away from @xmath60 , and consequently the vhs is lowered , resulting in a rounded fermi surface .",
    "fig.4 the band structure of the two ( @xmath2-@xmath1 ) orbital model for la@xmath3cuo@xmath7 ( left ) and hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath7 ( right ) .",
    "the top ( middle ) panels depict the strength of the @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) characters with thickened lines , while the bottom panels the fermi surfaces ( for a total band filling @xmath72 ) .",
    "[ fig4 ]    if we estimate in the two - orbital model the ratio @xmath73 _ within the @xmath2 orbitals _ , we get 0.35 for the la system against 0.41 for hg , which are rather close to each other .",
    "this contrasts with the situation in which the model is constrained into a single band model that considers one kind of wannier orbital to reproduce the main band that intersects the fermi energy .",
    "there , the wannier orbital has mainly @xmath2 character , but has `` tails '' with a @xmath1 character especially for the la system .",
    "then the ratio @xmath73 in the single - orbital model reduces to 0.14 for la against 0.37 for hg , which is just the conventional view mentioned in the introduction . from this",
    ", we can confirm that it is the @xmath1 contribution that makes the fermi surface in the la system square shaped , while the `` intrinsic '' fermi surface of the high @xmath0 cuprate family is , as in the hg system , rounded ( which is actually due to the cu @xmath70 orbital as shown in ref.@xcite , whose contribution is effectively considered in the present model ) .",
    "for the many body part of the hamiltonian , we consider the standard interaction terms that comprise the intra - orbital coulomb @xmath18 , the inter - orbital coulomb @xmath74 , the hund s coupling @xmath17 and the pair - hopping @xmath75 .",
    "the many body hamiltonian then reads @xmath76 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 denote the sites and @xmath78 the orbitals , and @xmath79 is the transfer energy obtained from the maximally localized wannier orbitals .    for these models",
    ", we apply spin fluctuation theory and solve the eliashberg equation to analyze superconductivity .",
    "multiorbital random phase approximation ( rpa ) is described in e.g. refs.@xcite . in the present case ,",
    "green s function @xmath80 @xmath81 is a @xmath82 matrix , where @xmath83 is the number of orbitals .",
    "the irreducible susceptibility matrix @xmath84 @xmath85 has @xmath86 components , and the spin and the charge ( orbital ) susceptibility matrices are obtained from matrix equations , @xmath87 @xmath88 where @xmath89 the green s function and the effective singlet pairing interaction , @xmath90 are plugged into the linearized eliashberg equation , @xmath91 here , @xmath0 is the temperature where the eigenvalue @xmath92 reaches unity , so when @xmath92 is calculated at a fixed temperature for different situations / materials , the value can be considered as a qualitative measure for the @xmath0 .",
    "we first look into the superconductivity of pnictides . we apply rpa to the 5 orbital model , where we take @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95ev , the temperature is fixed at @xmath96  ev and @xmath97 @xmath98-point meshes and 512 matsubara frequencies are taken .",
    "let us first look at the the spin susceptibility of lafeaso . in the top panels of fig.5 , we show @xmath99 and @xmath100 , which represent the spin correlation within @xmath28 and @xmath29 orbitals , respectively . @xmath99 peaks solely around @xmath52 and @xmath54 , which reflects the nesting between the @xmath101-charactered portions of @xmath62 and @xmath63 fermi pockets as shown in a bottom panel of fig.5 . on the other hand , @xmath100 has peaks around @xmath102 and around @xmath103 as well .",
    "the former is due to the nesting between the @xmath45 quasi fermi surface and the @xmath29 portion of the @xmath63 fermi surface as was first pointed out in ref.@xcite , while the latter originates from the nesting between the @xmath29 portion of the @xmath104 and @xmath105 fermi surfaces.@xcite the @xmath102 feature is consistent with the stripe ( i.e. , collinear ) antiferromagnetic order for the undoped case , which was suggested by transport and optical reflectance@xcite , and further confirmed by neutron scattering experiments.@xcite the stabilization of such an antiferromagnetic ordering has also been pointed out in first principles calculations.@xcite furthermore , the presence of spin fluctuations near the wavevector @xmath102 _ in the unfolded brillouin zone _ has indeed been confirmed in an inelastic neutron scattering experiment@xcite .",
    "fig.5 top panel : rpa result of the diagonal component of the spin susceptibility matrix , @xmath99(left ) and @xmath100(right ) ( @xmath106 ) for lafeaso .",
    "bottom panel : nesting is shown for the fermi surface for orbitals @xmath107 ( left ) and for @xmath108 ( right ) . here",
    "the thickness of the fermi surface represents the strength of the respective orbital character .",
    "the gray areas around the corners in the left panel indicates the @xmath45 `` quasi '' fermi surface .",
    "[ fig5 ]    when the pairing is mediated by spin fluctuations , the gap on the fermi surface tends to change its sign across the wave vector at which the spin fluctuations develop .",
    "since there are multiple spin fluctuation modes in our model , the superconducting gap should be determined by the cooperation or competition between these multiple modes .",
    "specifically , the @xmath62-@xmath63 and @xmath45-@xmath63 nestings tend to favor the fully - gapped , sign - reversing @xmath4-wave ( @xmath109-wave ) , in which the gap changes sign between @xmath62 and @xmath63 and also between @xmath45 and @xmath63 , but has a constant sign on each pocket as shown in fig.5.@xcite .",
    "this kind of gap has in fact been considered in the context of raising @xmath0 in spin fluctuation mediated pairing in that the nodes of the gap , which is a necessary evil for spin fluctuation mediated pairing , do not have to intersect the fermi surface@xcite . on the other hand , @xmath104-@xmath105 nesting tends to change the sign of the gap between these pockets , which can result in either @xmath21-wave or an @xmath4-wave pairing with nodes on the @xmath63 fermi surface , as shown in fig.5 @xcite .",
    "fig.6 top and middle panels : the fully - gapped @xmath109 wave , the nodal @xmath109 wave and @xmath21 wave gap are schematically shown .",
    "the solid red ( dashed blue ) curves represent positive ( negative ) sign of the gap .",
    "the arrows indicate the dominating nesting vectors .",
    "bottom : the @xmath4-wave and @xmath21-wave eigenvalues of the eliashberg equation plotted as functions of as height for the hypothetical lattice structure of lafeaso .",
    "the figures in the left and right insets show schematically the presence or absence of frustration .",
    "[ fig6 ]    when the pnictogen atom is at low positions , the @xmath110 nesting is not effective , and the competition between @xmath111 and @xmath103 spin fluctuations results in a frustration in momentum space , where the gap tends to change the sign of the gap across these vectors .",
    "consequently , the @xmath4-wave gap has nodes intersecting the @xmath63 fermi surface , and this pairing is nearly degenerate with @xmath21-wave pairing .",
    "when the pnictogen is high , the @xmath63-@xmath45 nesting becomes more effective than the @xmath104-@xmath105 nesting , and the two kinds of of @xmath111 spin fluctuations , those originating from @xmath112 and @xmath29 orbitals , cooperates without experiencing frustration to result in the fully gapped @xmath109-wave pairing .",
    "the absence / presence of the frustration affects also the strength of the superconducting instability , where the fully gapped case has a stronger tendency toward pairing .",
    "this can be seen from the eigenvalue of the eliashberg equation plotted as a function of the pnictogen height in the bottom panel of fig.6 , where we adopt the 5 band model for lafeaso , but vary the height .",
    "thus the pnictogen height @xmath64 acts as a switch between higher @xmath0 nodeless and low @xmath0 nodal pairings , which explains the difference between ndfeaso and lafepo in both @xmath0 and the gap .    here",
    ", we have focused on the effect of the @xmath45 fermi surface around @xmath59 in the context of the lattice structure dependence , but its effect has recently been studied in detail from the viewpoint of the electron - electron interaction and the band filling @xcite .",
    "also , a real space picture for the presence / absence of the nodes in the gap has been discussed@xcite .",
    "the electron correlation effects beyond rpa has also been taken into account in the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) study@xcite and a functional renormalization group study@xcite , which also finds a similar effect of the @xmath45 fermi surface on the presence / absence of nodes in the superconducting gap .",
    "the above scenario is consistent with the presence of line nodes in the superconducting gap of the low @xmath0 phosphides @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the fully gapped @xmath109-wave is difficult to detect experimentally because the absolute value of the gap is essentially the same as that of a simple @xmath4-wave gap , with no characteristic angular dependence .",
    "nevertheless , a recent phase sensitive stm experiment has clearly detected the sign reverse between the fermi surfaces separated by @xmath102@xcite .",
    "we now move on to the superconductivity in the cuprates . for the electron - electron interactions , we take @xmath113ev , @xmath114ev , which gives the interorbital @xmath115ev .",
    "the temperature is fixed at @xmath116ev . as for the band filling ( number of electrons / site ) , we concentrate on the total @xmath72 , for which the main band has 0.85 . here",
    "we apply the multiorbital flex@xcite , which takes into account the self - energy correction to the green s function self - consistently , for the three - dimensional lattice taking @xmath117 @xmath98-point meshes and 1024 matsubara frequencies .    here",
    "again , we focus on how the anion height , namely , the apical oxygen height measured from the cuo@xmath3 plane affects the band structure and hence superconductivity .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the energy level offset between @xmath2 and @xmath1 orbitals should be controlled ( at least partially ) by the ligand field , hence by the height , @xmath118 , of the apical oxygen@xcite . to single out this effect ,",
    "let us examine the two - orbital model of the la cuprate for which we increase @xmath118 from its original value @xmath119with other lattice parameters fixed . in fig.7(a ) , we plot the eliashberg equation eigenvalue of the @xmath21-wave superconductivity as a function of @xmath118 .",
    "we can see that @xmath92 monotonically increases with the height . as seen from the inset of fig.7(b ) , @xmath120 , defined as the difference of the on - site energy between @xmath2 and @xmath1 orbitals , is positively correlated with @xmath118 as expected , and importantly , fig.7(b ) shows that the increase in @xmath92 is positively correlated with the increase in @xmath120 .",
    "hence the superconductivity turns out to be enhanced as the @xmath1 band moves away from the main band .",
    "note that this occurs _ despite the fermi surface becoming more rounded _ with larger @xmath120 , namely , the effect of the orbital character ( smaller @xmath1 contribution ) dominates over the fermi surface shape effect .",
    "conversely , the strong @xmath1 orbital character in the fermi surface around the wave vectors @xmath102 works destructively against @xmath21-wave superconductivity .",
    "physically , this may be understood as follows .",
    "@xmath21-wave superconductivity occurs due to pair scattering from @xmath121 to @xmath122 and vice versa mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations ( fig.7(c ) ) . when the states around @xmath102 has strong @xmath1 character , superconductivity is suppressed since @xmath21-wave pairing has a rough tendency for higher @xmath0 in bands that are nearly half filled , whereas the @xmath1 orbital here is nearly full filled ( has holes only around @xmath71 ) .    in fig.7",
    ", we have also plotted the corresponding values of the hg system obtained with the actual lattice structure .",
    "we can see that @xmath120 in hg is indeed larger than that in la as expected , but actually @xmath123ev for hg is larger than @xmath124ev , which is the value the la system would take for @xmath125 .",
    "consequently , @xmath92 for hg is somewhat larger than that for the la system with the same value of @xmath118 .",
    "this implies that there are also some effects other than the apical oxygen height that also enhance @xmath120 ( i.e. , lower the @xmath1 level with respect to the @xmath2 level ) in the hg system , thereby further favoring @xmath21-wave superconductivity . in this context , the present result reminds us of the so - called `` maekawa s plot '' , where a positive correlation between @xmath0 and the level of the apical oxygen @xmath69 hole was pointed out@xcite . since a higher @xmath69 hole level ( i.e. , a lower @xmath69 electron level ) is likely to lower @xmath126 because the @xmath1 wannier orbital in our model consists mainly of cu@xmath127 and apical oxygen @xmath128 orbitals ,",
    "the positive correlation between @xmath120 and @xmath0 found here is indeed consistent with maekawa s plot .",
    "fig.7 the eigenvalue of the eliashberg equation @xmath92 ( red circles ) when @xmath118(a ) or @xmath120(b ) is varied hypothetically in the lattice structure of la@xmath3cuo@xmath7 .",
    "blue diamond indicates the eigenvalue of hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath7 .",
    "inset in ( b ) shows the relation between @xmath118 and @xmath120 . in ( c )",
    ", the pair scattering of @xmath1 holes around @xmath52 @xmath54 is illustrated .",
    "in this paper , we have focused on the origin of the material dependence of superconductivity in the two families of high @xmath0 superconductors , pnictides and cuprates .",
    "we have analyzed the superconductivity within the spin fluctuation pairing theory applied to models that take into account the realistic multiorbital band structure .",
    "it is shown that not only in the iron pnictides , but even in the cuprates , the multiorbital band structure is affected by the lattice structure , which in turn affects superconductivity . it is interesting to note that in both families , the anion height measured from the cation plane plays an important role , although its effect on the band structure appears in a different manner : in the cuprates the the energy difference between @xmath2 and @xmath1 is affected by the ligand field , while in the pnictides , the relative position between the @xmath29 and @xmath46 bands are affected mainly due to the variation of the band width , namely , the former ( latter ) band lies in the upper ( lower ) portion of the band structure , so that when the band width becomes wider upon lowering the height , the location of the lower band edge of @xmath29 and that of the upper band edge of @xmath46 ( both around the wave vector @xmath59 ) is exchanged .",
    "the good description of the material dependence of the superconductivity within the present approach suggests commonality between the two families in that the spin degrees of freedom are playing an important role in the occurrence of superconductivity@xcite , although there are differences in the strength of the electron correlation .",
    "the present studies show that a combination of effective model construction based on first principles band calculation and application of many body theory can give a realistic description on the material dependence of superconductivity in correlated systems , and may even suggest a possibility of theoretically predicting new superconductors in the near future .",

    "<S> both families of high @xmath0 superconductors , iron pnictides and cuprates , exhibit material dependence of superconductivity . here , </S>",
    "<S> we study its origin within the spin fluctuation pairing theory based on multiorbital models that take into account realistic band structures . for pnictides </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the presence and absence of fermi surface pockets is sensitive to the pnictogen height measured from the iron plane due to the multiorbital nature of the system , which is reflected to the nodeless / nodal form of the superconducting gap and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , even for the cuprates , which is conventionally modeled by a single orbital model , the multiorbital band structure is shown to play a crucial role in the material dependence of superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , by adopting a two orbital model that considers the @xmath1 orbital on top of the @xmath2 orbital , we can resolve a long standing puzzle of why the single layered hg cuprate have much higher @xmath0 than the la cuprate . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , here again the apical oxygen height measured from the cuo@xmath3 plane plays an important role in determining the relative energy difference between @xmath2 and @xmath1 orbitals , thereby strongly affecting the superconductivity .    </S>",
