    "the physics of light nuclei would seem to be fertile soil for the application of effective field theory techniques .",
    "these techniques rely on the existence of a hierarchy of scales .",
    "once such a hierarchy is established the central tenet of effective field theory ( eft ) is that the physics at energies much lower than some scale @xmath4 can not depend on the details of the dynamics at that scale .",
    "the physics at these higher energies appears implicitly in the low - energy effective theory , encoded in a series of contact operators .",
    "suppose then that there are a succession of scales in the problem :    @xmath5    if we gradually increase the energy being studied we can imagine modifying the effective theory to explicitly include the new physics which emerges as these new scales @xmath6 are successively reached .",
    "light nuclei appear to be an example of a system in which this kind of scale - separation exists .",
    "first , it is important to note that in light nuclei the scale of binding is `` unnaturally '' small .",
    "for instance , poles in the two - nucleon t - matrix occur at momenta of 8 mev ( in the @xmath7 channel ) and 46 mev ( in the @xmath8 channel ) .",
    "both of these are well below the next - lightest scale in the problem , @xmath9 .",
    "thus , key scales in these systems include @xmath10 , the characteristic momentum scale for nuclear binding ; @xmath9 , the pion mass ; and @xmath11 , the scale of chiral symmetry breaking . in the @xmath12 system we certainly have @xmath13 , although the characteristic momentum scale inside larger nuclei may be closer to @xmath9 .",
    "if one confines one s interest to momenta @xmath14 , then an effective field theory lagrangian containing contact nucleon - nucleon interactions with increasing numbers of derivatives can be employed .",
    "this theory has simple power - counting rules since higher - dimensional operators and loops are suppressed by powers of @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "however , an eft based on such counting has a very limited domain of validity .",
    "indeed , it is tautological that the bound state at energy @xmath16 can not itself be discussed in the context of such an effective theory . to be useful in nuclear physics",
    "it is essential that the effective theory s domain of validity be extended well beyond momenta @xmath17 of order @xmath10 so that it can describe light nuclei .",
    "somehow the non - perturbative physics associated with the low - energy poles in the @xmath2 t - matrix must be incorporated in the eft .",
    "once that has been achieved we can work in the regime @xmath18 , and discuss the bound state using a theory which need not explicitly include even the lightest meson , the pion .",
    "there has been much recent interest in such pionless effective theories for nuclear physics , as they serve to elucidate many issues associated with the treatment of these low - energy bound states in effective field theory  @xcite@xcite .",
    "they certainly simplify calculations , since the only operators which appear in the effective theory produce separable interactions in the two - nucleon system .",
    "the pionless theory is of somewhat limited use , since in many applications momenta @xmath19 are probed .",
    "this `` higher - momentum '' regime is , of course , still a low - momentum regime from the perspective of hadronic physics .",
    "the low - momentum effective theory of hadronic interactions is chiral perturbation theory , in which the pions are introduced as explicit fields .",
    "they appear as the pseudo - goldstone bosons of the spontaneously - broken ( approximate ) chiral symmetry @xmath20 .",
    "a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry is that all pion - pion or pion - nucleon interactions involve either derivatives or powers of the pion mass .",
    "it follows that a systematic power counting in momenta and @xmath9 may be developed in which higher - order interactions of the pions are suppressed by powers of @xmath9 and/or the typical momentum scale in the problem , @xmath17 .",
    "the techniques of chiral perturbation theory thus provide a systematic expansion which yields predictions for the interactions of pions , nucleons and photons at low momenta .",
    "these predictions have been successful in the zero- and one - nucleon sectors , and are essentially model - independent , as they are based only on the symmetries of qcd and power counting . for a detailed review on this subject see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we would like to also apply these techniques to many - nucleon systems .",
    "however , as noted above , in the two - nucleon case the situation is complicated by the presence of an additional scale which does not appear in the one - nucleon case : the characteristic momentum scale of the bound state , @xmath10 . in the @xmath12 case",
    "this is very different from @xmath9 and thus is usually treated as a separate scale in eft analyses of this problem .",
    "weinberg s proposal for dealing with the emergence of this new scale was to apply the methods of chiral perturbation theory only to graphs in which the energy flowing through all lines was of order @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "for these graphs the additional low - energy scale @xmath16 does not result in any complications , since , by assumption , the energy of all legs is significantly above that scale .",
    "thus chiral perturbation theory can be applied to these `` two - particle irreducible '' graphs without any modifications .",
    "the two - particle irreducible objects calculated in chiral perturbation theory must be sewn together with free green s functions of the multi - nucleon system in order to generate the actual s - matrix elements of the theory .",
    "( for reviews of the application of these ideas to the @xmath2 potential and probes of light nuclei see refs .",
    "it appears then that for the s - matrix elements themselves no systematic expansion exists , despite the demonstrable power - counting for objects that appear in their construction .",
    "such a point of view is similar to that seen when low - energy effective actions are derived using wilsonian renormalization group arguments ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more explicit investigations of this connection ) .",
    "these techniques are widely applied , and have , for instance , been used to obtain improved actions for lattice gauge theory . in all cases the effective action",
    "is obtained using a perturbation theory in the ratio of low - energy scales to the wilsonian rg cutoff scale . that lagrangian is then solved to all orders . in the same way",
    "chiral perturbation theory can be used to generate a nonrelativistic , particle - number - conserving hamiltonian for the nuclear system .",
    "this hamiltonian is valid up to a given order in the chiral expansion and can be employed in any many - nucleon system at low energy .",
    "once written down it should be solved to all orders .",
    "the interaction of the nucleus with electromagnetic , weak , and pionic currents can then also be derived in chiral perturbation theory ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for full consistency",
    "the expansion for the interaction with the external probe should be taken to the same chiral order as the maximum order used in the chiral expansion of the @xmath2 system hamiltonian .",
    "an alternative to this approach is the q - counting scheme pioneered by kaplan , savage , and wise  @xcite . in this approach power - counting for s - matrix elements",
    "is explicit , with all quantities being written as an expansion in the ratio of @xmath22 , @xmath17 , and @xmath9 to some underlying scale @xmath4 . in practice , the deuteron ( or the quasi - bound state in the @xmath7 channel ) is generated by iterating a non - derivative contact interaction to all orders .",
    "this builds into the theory an explicit low - energy pole ; all other interactions ( including one - pion exchange ) are then treated perturbatively , with a power - counting for the short - distance physics determined by the renormalization group flows of the operators . a number of observables in the two - nucleon system have been calculated using q - counting , and it appears to work well for many observables at momenta @xmath23 . however , as yet , no observable has been calculated where this q - counting approach with explicit pions works demonstrably better than a similar q - counting developed for the pionless effective theory .",
    "this does raise the question of how well q - counting actually incorporates the pionic physics of the @xmath2 system .    in this paper",
    "we adopt weinberg s power - counting , and make what are essentially chiral perturbation theory expansions of the @xmath2 potential and the two - particle - irreducible kernel for electron - deuteron scattering .",
    "our goal is to examine the physics of deuteron electromagnetic form factors within this approach .",
    "our nucleon - nucleon potential has a structure determined from an effective field theory expansion .",
    "higher - derivative nucleon - nucleon interactions are suppressed by appropriate powers of the characteristic short - distance scale @xmath4 .",
    "accordingly we follow lepage s usage  @xcite and refer to this scheme as @xmath4-counting .",
    "we will demonstrate that this approach to effective field theory can be used to generate deuteron wave functions which are in accord with the wave functions of much more sophisticated , albeit more phenomenological , nucleon - nucleon potential models , for all radii @xmath24 larger than about @xmath25 .",
    "the difference between these two different types of wave function then occurs almost entirely at short distances , i.e. distances less than @xmath25 .",
    "so , if the central tenet of effective field theory is indeed correct in the deuteron system these simpler wave functions should be adequate for the calculation of low - energy observables . to put this the other way around ,",
    "if our wave functions yield predictions for low - energy quantities which differ significantly from those of potential models then this represents an unexpected sensitivity to short - distance dynamics .",
    "such a sensitivity is unexpected precisely because it is contrary to a very basic belief which underpins the success of effective field theory .",
    "of course , these wave functions are not physical observables .",
    "nevertheless , as will be discussed below , the asymptotic tails of the wave functions , can , in principle , be obtained from experiment  @xcite .",
    "physical observables dominated by such tails should be well described in our approach .",
    "more generally , the eft framework used here gives the nonrelativistic impulse approximation as the leading nontrivial  order for many observables .",
    "as is well known , in this approximation for electron - deuteron scattering the wave functions for particular deuteron magnetic sub - states are probed . therefore we can test the `` central tenet '' by computing the three electromagnetic form factors of the deuteron using our effective - field - theory - motivated wave functions and comparing them to results from potential model wave functions .",
    "this allows us to examine how large the momentum transfer @xmath3 must be before one starts probing the physics at scale @xmath11 which was not explicitly included in the development of the deuteron wave function .",
    "thus , at the heart of this paper is a calculation of electron - deuteron scattering in effective field theory .",
    "a calculation of this process in q - counting recently appeared  @xcite , but until now @xmath4-counting has not been applied to this reaction except at zero momentum - transfer  @xcite .",
    "perhaps this is because the results are not very surprising !",
    "indeed , we shall demonstrate that @xmath4-counting provides a systematic justification for many of the features observed in potential model calculations of the deuteron electromagnetic form factors : the importance of corrections associated with nucleon structure , the unimportance of relativistic corrections at low @xmath26 , and the strong suppression of meson - exchange current mechanisms at these momentum transfers .",
    "this approach leads to simple power - counting rules to estimate errors for the form factors @xmath0 , @xmath27 , and @xmath1 , and we will calculate these quantities up to the next - to - leading nontrivial  order in our expansion . moreover , for certain long - distance observables  such as @xmath28the errors can be estimated even more accurately .",
    "the reason that this is possible is because such moments are dominated by the tails of the wave function which , as noted above , are physical quantities .",
    "these arguments show that the deuteron electromagnetic form factors can be concretely related to the deuteron wave function , provided that one works only at low orders in the @xmath4-expansion .",
    "so , we would suggest that these form factors at momenta @xmath29 are a good place to test the efficacy of the competing schemes reproduction of the physics of the pion range inside the deuterium nucleus .",
    "in particular , this may shed some light on whether one - pion exchange can be treated perturbatively in the two - nucleon system .",
    "as mentioned above , it is a consequence of q - counting that one - pion exchange should be sub - leading , with the leading effect provided by the unnaturally - enhanced contact operators that yield a bound deuteron .",
    "cohen and hansen have shown that such an expansion for the @xmath2 amplitude can be obtained from _ any _ potential @xmath30 , provided that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the range of the short - distance potential @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "while this shows that one - pion exchange can indeed be treated perturbatively in a particular formal limit it remains unclear whether @xmath9 is small enough in the physical world to make the results thereby obtained useful  @xcite .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in sec .  2 we review the basic physics of nucleon - nucleon potential models ,",
    "provide a more detailed introduction to effective field theory than the thumbnail sketch given here , and outline our particular approach to the calculation of deuteron wave functions and electromagnetic properties .",
    "section 3 contains the details of our calculation of this wave function , along with some specific error estimates for quantities like @xmath28 .",
    "section 4 gives a description of the expansion that @xmath4-counting provides for the kernel of the electron - deuteron scattering reaction . in sec .",
    "5 we present our results from this calculation .",
    "these include results for static deuteron properties , which are shown to have errors in accord with our systematic error estimates , and results for @xmath0 , @xmath27 and @xmath1 .",
    "note that in the latter cases we do not compare with experimental data , since potential model calculations are already very successful for these observables .",
    "rather , by comparing the predictions for @xmath0 , @xmath27 and @xmath1 with those of potential models we see that the `` central tenet '' of effective field theory is alive and well in the deuteron . finally our results are summarized and our conclusions discussed in section  [ sec - conclusion ] .",
    "traditionally , low - energy phenomena in light nuclei have been described using the schrdinger equation with a model for the @xmath2 potential . in practice ,",
    "all sensible potentials include the one - pion exchange   potential ( opep ) as their long - range tail .",
    "the inclusion of opep is required on theoretical grounds , as it uniquely describes the longest - range part of the strong interaction .",
    "this can also be seen experimentally , since opep is essential in the description of the higher partial waves in @xmath2 scattering . on the other hand ,",
    "apart from their common one - pion exchange tails , different @xmath2 potential models look rather dissimilar .",
    "some include a set of single ( or , in some cases , double ) boson - exchanges to generate the short - distance piece of the interaction , as in the nijmegen  @xcite or the original bonn potentials  @xcite .",
    "others have a more phenomenological short - distance structure , e.g. the reid potential  @xcite , the paris potential  @xcite , or the argonne potentials  @xcite  . in all cases",
    "the short - distance potential must be rich enough to describe the existing data .",
    "once a particular form is chosen the schrdinger equation is solved and the free parameters are fit to the @xmath2 scattering data and certain deuteron bound state  properties .",
    "this is now an extremely sophisticated enterprise .",
    "potentials exist which fit the @xmath34 and @xmath35 scattering data up to laboratory energies of 350 mev with a @xmath36 per degree of freedom close to one  @xcite .",
    "such models also do a very good job in describing a wide array of low - energy data obtained using electroweak probes .",
    "to calculate the response of the nucleus to these probes , single - nucleon currents and potential - model wave functions are often employed . in some cases such a construction does not lead to a conserved electromagnetic current , and so additional `` model independent '' two - body currents are added to restore current conservation ( see , for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , transverse currents are not constrained by current conservation and so are always `` model dependent '' .",
    "the forms chosen reflect dynamical assumptions about the important physical mechanisms , e.g. that pionic , @xmath37-meson , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 meson - exchange currents dominate the transverse currents . for a thorough review of this approach and its application in few - nucleon systems see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , at the very least , potential models represent an extremely efficient way to describe the data . on the other hand ,",
    "one difficulty of the approach is that it is hard to know what is learned about the dynamics from the success of the description .",
    "the fact that a variety of potential models with different short - distance dynamics all do well in describing the data suggests that a good description of the data does not necessarily indicate identification of the underlying short - distance processes .",
    "however , from an effective - field - theory viewpoint this is entirely to be expected .",
    "indeed , the central tenet of effective field theory is that it is not possible to resolve details of short - distance physics from low - momentum observables .",
    "thus in an eft framework , attempts to get the `` right '' short - distance @xmath2 potential using low - momentum data are futile .",
    "this suggests that the limitation be viewed as an opportunity .",
    "if details of short - distance physics did strongly affect low - energy observables it is very unlikely we would ever make any good predictions at low energy . after all , there are an infinite number of choices for the short - distance physics and we are unlikely to stumble on the right one .",
    "potential models have predictive power precisely because the details of the short - distance physics do not matter greatly .",
    "thus , the very success of a variety of @xmath2 potential models suggests that the @xmath2 system is well suited to an eft treatment .",
    "having said this , there are a number of different views on how to implement effective field theory ideas in nuclear physics . that originally proposed by weinberg  @xcite and employed by lepage in refs .",
    "@xcite allows one to think straightforwardly about the connection of eft and potential models . as discussed in the introduction , in this approach ,",
    "known as `` @xmath4-counting '' , the focus is on power counting at the level of the hamiltonian in the @xmath2 piece of the hadronic hilbert space .",
    "the effective lagrangian consists of @xmath2 contact interactions together with the standard heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory lagrangian : @xmath42 at lowest order @xmath43 may be written in a form which explicitly shows that at this order the interaction terms involving zero- and one - pion field take the form of a standard nonrelativistic lagrangian for the interactions of pions , nucleons and photons  @xcite : @xmath44 +    \\frac{1}{2}({\\bf e}^2 - { \\bf b}^2 ) , \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : nrl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 mev , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the nucleon and pion isodoublet and isotriplet .",
    "chiral symmetry is not manifest here , as the lagrangian written in terms of the objects which transform appropriately under @xmath20 has been expanded out in terms of the more familiar @xmath47 to yield eq .",
    "( [ eq : nrl ] ) . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the electric and magnetic fields of the photon , and @xmath50 is the usual covariant derivative , which ensures that @xmath51 transforms in the same way as @xmath46 under the group @xmath52 : @xmath53 with @xmath54 the isospin - space matrix : @xmath55 and @xmath56 the photon field .",
    "the ellipses indicate that additional terms in @xmath50 involving one or more pion fields are needed if it is to also be a covariant derivative under @xmath20 .",
    "these terms do not play a role in any of our calculations .",
    "meanwhile the s - wave piece of the lagrangian containing the four - nucleon contact terms is : @xmath57 + \\ldots.\\ ] ]    this lagrangian can then be used to generate an @xmath2 potential , @xmath58 as follows . in principle",
    ", @xmath58 contains all two - particle - irreducible @xmath59 graphs . as shown by weinberg and ordoz et al .",
    "@xcite , each of these graphs is of a given order in the chiral expansion , and more complicated graphs occur at higher order .",
    "the other issue here is how to count the contact interactions @xmath60 . in the framework of `` @xmath4-counting '' for @xmath58",
    ", we simply use naive dimensional analysis in this nonrelativistic field theory to estimate : @xmath61 it follows that at leading order in @xmath4-counting , the @xmath2 potential has two pieces  @xcite :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is a contact interaction which is a constant in momentum space ( or equivalently , a three - dimensional delta - function in coordinate space ) .",
    "this contact operator gives the short - distance piece of the @xmath2 interaction , while one - pion exchange gives the long - range tail .",
    "indeed , at any chiral order an analogous separation into a long- and short - distance @xmath2 eft potential can be made . at low orders in the expansion",
    "the short - distance part has straightforward @xmath4-counting , with the higher - derivative operators always suppressed by powers of @xmath64 .",
    "meanwhile , the long - distance piece is given by one - pion exchange plus irreducible two - pion exchange plus three - pion exchange plus etc .",
    "the dimension of the operators which these graphs produce in the @xmath2 hamiltonian turns out to increase by two for each additional pion loop  @xcite .",
    "consequently , these irreducible multiple pion exchanges are also suppressed by powers of @xmath65 and @xmath64 .",
    "both this long - range part of @xmath58 and the short - range part coming from the contact operators should then be truncated at the same order in the expansion in @xmath17 and @xmath9 over @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting potential is then used nonperturbatively   in a schrdinger equation .",
    "of course , this procedure will generate divergences unless the contact terms are regulated .",
    "this is achieved by taking some ( essentially arbitrary ) functional form parameterized by a regulator mass to serve as a regulated coordinate space three - dimensional delta function .",
    "practical implementation of the renormalization program is then quite simple : with the regulator mass fixed , one tunes the coefficients so as to reproduce some specified low - energy observables  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite such a fit to both @xmath2 phase shifts up to laboratory energies of 100 mev and deuteron properties was done with the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnnlo ) @xmath4-counting interaction .",
    "three different regulator parameters and a gaussian regulator were employed to render finite the divergences which would otherwise have appeared .    with renormalizable theories ,",
    "the next step would be to take the regulator mass to infinity . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is argued that this should not be done for these effective theories .",
    "rather , the regulator mass is to be set at , or near , the scale of the short - distance physics , @xmath4 .",
    "one advantage in doing this is that one then expects that the bare coefficients in the expansion will be of the size given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : c2nsize ] ) , whereas if regulator scales were chosen to be very different from @xmath4 the values of the bare coefficients could be quite different from this naive - dimensional - analysis estimate .",
    "moreover , by keeping the regulator finite and of order @xmath4 one avoids the difficulties discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this particular treatment of short - distance physics in eft is actually not very different from that employed in some of the traditional potential models described above .",
    "any functional form given by a potential model with characteristic scale @xmath4 and @xmath66 parameters could be rewritten as the sum of @xmath66 terms with each term given by derivatives of some `` regulated delta - function '' .",
    "thus , the gain achieved in using eft as compared to traditional potential models is really the ability to treat the long - distance physics and the current operators in a manner consistent with each other and with the short - distance physics by working to a given order in @xmath4-counting in the system s hamiltonian .",
    "in particular @xmath4-counting constrains the number and form of current operators allowable at a given order and mandates the type of pion - loop and pion exchange   mechanisms which should be included in the calculation . such formal consistency is very satisfying .",
    "it also confers the practical advantage that errors can be estimated in a reliable way .",
    "the key point is that the characteristic size of the physics neglected at each stage of the calculation is known . in particular , in this work we use the eft approach to analyze uncertainties in calculations of electromagnetic properties of the deuteron .",
    "the errors which arise include uncertainties in our wave functions and uncertainties in the current operators  both of which are due to truncations in the @xmath4-expansion . in discussing these errors",
    "we first focus on the tail of the bound state  wave function , which , while not directly observable , can be obtained indirectly from scattering data .",
    "this can be seen simply in a spectral representation of the general off - shell @xmath2 t - matrix .",
    "the t - matrix diverges as one approaches a bound state pole in energy .",
    "then , if there is a bound state @xmath67 at @xmath68 the residue there is directly related to the bound state  density - matrix via :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the free hamiltonian .",
    "now , consider both sides of this equation in coordinate space . in both the initial and the final state",
    "take the relative distance between the two nucleons to be much larger than the range of the interaction . for positive energies",
    "the left - hand side can be expressed in terms of the measured @xmath2 phase shifts .",
    "this gives the coordinate - space tail of the scattering wave function .",
    "an extrapolation to the bound state  pole at @xmath68 may then be made to obtain the tail of the bound state  wave function .",
    "thus , for systems with a shallow bound state , accurate scattering data determines the asymptotic tail of the bound state  wave function in a model - independent way .",
    "since our interest here is in long - distance phenomena in the deuteron , it seems sensible to choose our fitting procedure to ensure that the asymptotic deuteron wave function is correct . if some other fitting - procedure were employed , e.g. fitting the coefficients in a taylor expansion of the @xmath71 matrix or @xmath72 , additional errors will be introduced , since the tail of the deuteron wave function would acquire some errors as part of the extrapolation from finite @xmath17 to @xmath73 .",
    "these errors are formally higher - order in the power counting .",
    "indeed , they are very small in @xmath4-counting , as demonstrated in a calculation without explicit pions by park et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    "the @xmath74 scattering length and effective range were fitted and @xmath75 was then reproduced to about 1% accuracy .",
    "since we are free to choose among the different possible fitting procedures , and these are all equivalent to the order we work here , we fit to the experimental values for the deuteron binding energy @xmath16 , and for the asymptotic s and d - state normalizations @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this has the merit that the longest - distance parts of the wave function is described perfectly , within the experimental errors .",
    "in particular , the deuteron pole appears at the correct location in the complex energy plane , and has the correct residue .",
    "proceeding in this way we integrate this essentially - exact asymptotic form from @xmath77 inward .",
    "errors become large when we reach one - pion ranges if only the free schrdinger equation is used to do this integration .",
    "if one - pion exchange is added to the differential equation used in integrating inwards the resulting wave functions are accurate down to distances @xmath78 . adding two - pion exchange",
    "would further increase the range over which the wave functions are accurate .",
    "moreover , as we shall show in section  [ sec - tpe ] the chiral suppression of two - pion exchange noted above means that the effects of the two - pion exchange   potential will be small even at ranges where they might be thought to be important .",
    "similarly , relativistic corrections to both the nucleon motion and the one - pion exchange   potential are suppressed by powers of @xmath79 , where @xmath17 is the typical momentum inside the bound state .",
    "it is therefore quite easy to demonstrate that the wave functions employed are accurate in the region @xmath80 up to corrections of relative order @xmath81 , where @xmath82 could be either the typical nuclear momentum , @xmath17 , or @xmath9 , and @xmath4 is @xmath11 or @xmath83 .",
    "of course , in pursuing the wave function to ever smaller @xmath24 ultimately one reaches a distance @xmath32 which is so short that the chiral expansion for the potential fails , and some physics beyond the range of the effective theory starts to play a role . at this point",
    "we employ an arbitrary regulator , motivated by the regulated delta - function of @xmath4-counting , to ensure that the wave function has the correct behavior as @xmath84 .",
    "the way in which the deuteron wave function is obtained in this `` integrating in '' picture is very similar to that employed for scattering wave functions in the nijmegen phase - shift analyses  @xcite .    for probes of the deuteron which probe the scale @xmath32 the error analysis employed in this paper breaks down completely , since the wave function for @xmath85 is largely fallacious .",
    "on the other hand , it is one of the central conclusions of this paper that electron - deuteron scattering is _ not _ such a probe , at least provided that @xmath86 mev , and reasonable values for @xmath32 are chosen .",
    "thus far we have only spoken about errors in the wave function .",
    "of course , there are corresponding errors in the current . in this work",
    "we employ only the next - to - leading ( nlo ) order chiral - perturbation theory deuteronic current . that current is derived in sec .",
    "[ sec - kernel ] .",
    "it represents two particles of charge @xmath87 and zero and anomalous magnetic moments @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "no terms corresponding to the nucleon s charge or magnetic radius appear in the current at this order .",
    "such terms enter as a correction at the next order in the expansion .",
    "other corrections to the one - nucleon current also occur one order beyond that considered here . as for two - body currents , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec - kernel ] , in the chiral expansion _",

    "whether this distance can really be thought of as being due to the hadronic scale @xmath253 is a delicate matter which will engender some debate , since there is a factor of three or four between @xmath254 and 1.5 fm .",
    "in particular , cohen and hansen  @xcite have suggested that while an expansion in @xmath255 is likely to be reasonable , an expansion in @xmath256 is questionable if @xmath32 is this large .    finally , we can look at the plots in fig .",

    "this agreement persists all the way down to radii @xmath258 fm .    for a number of reasons",
    "then , it seems that @xmath240 fm is a sensible range to choose for the onset of short - distance physics in the @xmath2 interaction which is beyond the scope of the effective theory .",
    "however , we observe that , at least for the short - distance potential used here , such a choice of @xmath32 leads to wave functions which track closely with the `` true '' wave function to values of @xmath24 of order 0.5 fm .",
    "thus , it may well be that the errors obtained when the wave functions from such models are used will be significantly smaller than the estimates derived above , since the range over which the error in @xmath207 accrues is actually significantly less than @xmath32 .",
    "thus far our approach is not different to a primitive potential model calculation of the deuteron wave function .",

    "this is very similar to the procedure adopted in the nijmegen phase shift analyses of refs .",
    "we are arguing that such a calculation is in the spirit of effective field theory since we have separated the effects that different scales in the problem , @xmath127 , @xmath9 , and @xmath32 have on the wave function .",
    "we now wish to demonstrate that we may make truly systematic statements about observables . in this section",
    "we will first explain how standard techniques of effective field theory allow us to precisely quantify the validity of the nonrelativistic   impulse approximation for the calculation of the deuteron electromagnetic form factors .",

    "these are dominated by the tail of the wave function , which is precisely reproduced in our approach .",
    "indeed , the deuteron is a shallow bound state , and so _ most _ of the wave function is in the tail .",
    "this observation suffices to show that the leading relative error in @xmath207 varies as @xmath332 .",
    "by contrast , for the electromagnetic deuteron form factors @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath27 .",
    "the error estimate is only that our computation is accurate to @xmath333 .",
    "this leads us to observe that among the corrections arising at orders beyond that considered here , some are more important than others . for instance , relativistic corrections are suppressed by powers of @xmath244 and @xmath334 , and so turn out to be less important than corrections due to finite - nucleon size  at least once @xmath26 is moderately large .",
    "this is a generic issue in effective field theory : the error estimate is always conservative .",

    "@xcite are considerably more accurate than those of ref .",
    "@xcite , yet all three calculations are to next - to - leading order . similarly , here the deuteron form factors are well explained to considerably higher @xmath3 than in ref .",
    "this suggests that the deuteron wave function is more accurately described at @xmath78 if @xmath4-counting is employed .",
    "the physics which drives this improvement in the description of the form factors at @xmath29 is apparently @xmath4-counting s use of a opep which is iterated to all orders .",
    "= 11 cm    in an attempt to elucidate this issue we have integrated the s - wave deuteron wave function in from @xmath77 , including the effects of the central part of one - pion exchange only to leading order in perturbation theory .",
    "the results thereby obtained are quite different from the nonperturbative  treatment of one - pion exchange employed in section  [ sec - wavefunction ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - pertope ] ) .",
    "indeed the resulting @xmath344 differs significantly from the `` true '' wave function at @xmath345 fm  well below the scale where the wave function with opep iterated to all orders starts to deviate markedly from @xmath344 for the nijm93 potential . the dominant effect which brings the short - dashed curve of fig .",
    "[ fig - pertope ] down to the long - dashed one is the tensor coupling of the d - wave piece of the deuteron back into the s - wave .",
    "this may well be an indication that iterating parts of the low - order eft @xmath2 potential ( such as one - pion exchange ) to all orders generates effects which are numerically important even though they are formally of higher - order in q - counting .",
    "this possibility is not unreasonable since the dimensionless parameter identified with iterations of the one - pion exchange   interaction in s - wave scattering is  @xcite : @xmath346 a fairly large expansion parameter  @xcite .",
    "this is of particular concern in the triplet channel , since there are large clebsch - gordon coefficients in the s - d coupling opep .",
    "in addition , the form of the tensor force gives an enhancement factor relative to the central force of 7 at @xmath347 .",
    "these large enhancements underlie the conventional nuclear folklore that the second - order tensor force is extremely important , indeed far more important than central ope .",
    "in contrast , in q - counting , the effects of the tensor force on , say the @xmath74 phase shift only appear at next - to - next - to - leading order .",
    "this raises questions about how efficiently q - counting accounts for these effects .",
    "in contrast , @xmath4-counting includes this physics in a low - order calculation . while none of this demonstrates that q - counting fails it sheds some doubt on the desirability of treating one - pion exchange   effects perturbatively .",
    "a calculation of @xmath2 phase shifts in the @xmath8 channel to nnlo in q - counting is near completion  @xcite .",
    "clearly , such further investigation of the efficacy of a perturbative expansion for pionic physics is very important .",
    "what is also clear is that @xmath4-counting leads to an effective field theory approach for electromagnetic deuteron properties which is viable for momenta @xmath3 up to at least 700 mev .",
    "the picture that emerges is not very different from that seen in @xmath2 potential model calculations of the same quantities .",
    "the main advantage of an effective field theory treatment at these momentum transfers is that corrections to both the @xmath2 interaction and the deuteron current appear as systematic corrections in an expansion in @xmath348 where @xmath17 is the typical momentum inside the deuteron and @xmath11 is the scale of chiral symmetry breaking .",
