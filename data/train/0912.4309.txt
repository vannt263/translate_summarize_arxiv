    "photoassociation ( pa ) is a powerful technique exploited by researchers to probe the fundamental interactions of ultracold quantum gases @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is pa in metastable helium where release of the large internal energy during collisions provides unique experimental investigation strategies .",
    "we have recently analysed the pa process @xcite and obtained detailed information of the laser intensity dependence of the line shifts and widths of the resonance peaks in the pa spectra of ultracold metastable helium excited to the @xmath2 rovibrational states in the @xmath3  +  @xmath4asymptote .",
    "two variants of a full nonperturbative multichannel , close - coupled treatment were used to obtain the required scattering matrix @xmath5 in the presence of the non - vanishing asymptotic radiative coupling , one based upon dressed states , and the other on a modified radiative coupling that vanishes asymptotically .",
    "although both methods gave nearly identical results for the line shifts and widths , these peaks were superimposed on very significant backgrounds that differed , especially at higher laser intensities .",
    "these significant backgrounds are a direct consequence of the weakly bound nature of the excited levels in metastable helium and are not found in pa studies of other systems .    in common with all previous investigations of pa in ultracold gases",
    ", we assumed the dipole approximation in evaluating the matrix elements of the laser coupling .",
    "however , in light of the sensitivity of the background radiation loss to the form of the radiative coupling at large distances , we revisit the validity of this approximation and its applicability to weakly bound levels in general .",
    "the laser coupling term is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and the vector potential at the position @xmath8 of the ith electron is @xmath9.\\ ] ] here @xmath10 are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for a photon of angular frequency @xmath11 and polarization @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the wave - vector of the laser field , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the electron charge and mass respectively and @xmath17 is the normalization volume .",
    "the dipole approximation makes the assumption that @xmath18 .",
    "if the laser coupling is only significant in the region of the excited rovibrational states this is a reasonable assumption to make , as the outer turning points of the ultra long - range @xmath2 vibrational states of this investigation place an upper bound of @xmath19  @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the interatomic distance .",
    "since @xmath22 for the @xmath23 transition , this gives @xmath24 .",
    "the multichannel calculation of our previous investigation , however , involves open channels of the metastable basis coupled to the excited state , and the @xmath25-matrix elements and loss profiles were obtained by matching the asymptotic forms of the open channels at distances @xmath26  @xmath20 , much greater than the interatomic ranges of the vibrational states .",
    "the coupling to the excited state , even at very large ranges where the uncoupled bound wavefunction was negligible , still influenced the calculation due to the closeness of the bound levels to the excited state dissociation limit .",
    "this influence can be suppressed and the background to the pa spectra removed by artificially deepening the potential well .",
    "the presence of this background introduced new features such as the elimination of resonance peaks by saturation of the laser intensity , and it is evident that the laser coupling must be treated more carefully in non - perturbative calculations of pa profiles .",
    "the validity of the dipole approximation at large interatomic separations of @xmath27 is questionable , at least when weakly bound levels are considered . in this paper",
    "we study the effects of the non - dipole contributions to the pa spectra in metastable helium by firstly deriving an expression for the matrix elements of the laser coupling which fully includes the @xmath28 factors and then re - do the multichannel calculations of @xcite using these matrix elements .",
    "it is worth noting that the exponential term that is ignored in the dipole approximation has the effect of introducing a momentum transfer from the absorbed photon to the molecule . for ultracold atoms",
    "this momentum transfer can be much larger than the initial momentum of the colliding atoms .",
    "the close - coupled equations for the two colliding atoms in the applied laser field involve the matrix elements of the laser coupling operator , @xmath29 between basis states of the general form @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , are assumed to have no dependence upon the interatomic distance @xmath21 but may still depend upon the molecular orientation in the space - fixed frame , specified by the angles @xmath33 , and the electronic coordinates @xmath8 .",
    "the laser field states are denoted by @xmath34 , representing @xmath35 photons of frequency @xmath36 and polarization @xmath37 , where @xmath38 for @xmath39 polarization .",
    "we assume the laser is directed along the space - fixed @xmath40-axis .",
    "we consider the matrix element @xmath41 contributes , we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 ) requires the choice of a coordinate system .",
    "we specify the origin of the coordinate system to be the center of mass of the dimer ( assumed to consist of identical nuclei ) , such that the position of nucleus @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 and nucleus @xmath46 by @xmath47 .",
    "the electron coordinates @xmath8 can then be expressed as @xmath48 where the operator @xmath49 has eigenvalues of @xmath50 if electron @xmath51 is centered upon atom @xmath44 or @xmath46 respectively , and @xmath52 is the position vector of electron @xmath51 with origin at its respective atom .",
    "similarly , the momentum operators become @xmath53 .",
    "the matrix element ( [ cw-4 ] ) then becomes @xmath54 \\cdot \\bm\\epsilon_\\lambda \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times e^{\\hat{\\eta}_i i\\bm{k}\\cdot\\bm{r}/2 } e^{i\\bm{k}\\cdot\\bm{r}^\\prime_i }     separating the basis states into a rotational part which depends only upon @xmath33 and the electronic part that is independent of @xmath55 : @xmath56 the first and third terms are zero since @xmath57 . in the second and fourth terms",
    "we can assume @xmath58 as the inner product @xmath59 only in the regions of the atomic electrons .",
    "as such , the second term is also zero because the ground and excited states are orthogonal .",
    "to proceed , we use the expansion for a plane wave in terms of legendre polynomials @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a wigner rotation matrix @xcite . recalling the equality @xmath62 /   \\hbar$ ] , where @xmath63 is the atomic dipole operator for electron @xmath51 , the matrix element becomes @xmath64 |\\psi^\\text{el}_g \\rangle \\cdot",

    "the expansion required is @xmath68 where the subscripts @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the spherical tensor components in the space- and molecular - fixed frames respectively and @xmath71 .",
    "this expansion allows the complete separation of the rotational and electronic parts of the matrix element : @xmath72 , have been combined using standard angular momentum theory @xcite .",
    "the appropriate explicit basis states are the hybrid hund case ( c ) states @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the orbital , spin and total angular momenta of atom @xmath77 and @xmath78 where @xmath79 with all other necessary atomic quantum numbers specified by @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath81 is the total electronic angular momentum and @xmath82 is the total angular momentum of the atom including rotation @xmath83 .",

    "the evaluation of the dipole operator must be performed in the @xmath89 basis under the correct symmetry considerations @xcite , however the inclusion of @xmath90 modifies this result . in similar fashion to @xcite",

    "the presence of @xmath114 is a direct result of the inclusion of the @xmath115 term .    to convert to the original basis ( [ cw-13 ] )",
    ", the transformation ( a.11 ) of @xcite is used .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath116 in the basis ( [ cw-13 ] ) reduces to @xmath117\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath118 @xmath119 is a wigner 9-j coefficient , and dashed quantities refer to the @xmath0 state and undashed quantities to the @xmath105 state .",
    "the matrix element of the rotational part of @xmath120 is @xmath121 using the properties of the rotation matrices , the integral can be evaluated @xcite so that @xmath122    the complete matrix element is therefore @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the laser intensity .",
    "the dipole approximation corresponds to setting @xmath125 , and therefore , since @xmath126 , to @xmath127 in equation ( [ cw-19 ] )",
    ". is missing from equation ( b16 ) of @xcite ] the @xmath127 term of ( [ cw-19 ] ) differs from the dipole approximation result by the presence of @xmath128 which varies little over the region of the excited bound levels but does oscillate and decay significantly outside this region .",
    "larger values of @xmath129 do not contribute strongly in the molecular region due to the small magnitude of @xmath130 for @xmath131 but are significant in the asymptotic region .",
    "lastly , we note that the restriction @xmath132 arising from the dipole approximation is broken , as even values of @xmath129 contribute to couplings to gerade metastable states and odd values of @xmath129 couple to ungerade metastable states .",
    "we first perform the calculations using the same basis states for the @xmath133 coupling set that are used in @xcite , i.e. we calculate photoassociation from the gerade metastable @xmath134 channels to the @xmath135 , @xmath136 adiabatic potential that asymptotes to @xmath137 . unlike the calculations of @xcite , the asymptotic radiation coupling is zero because the summation over @xmath129 only contributes for @xmath138 and over this finite sum the spherical bessel functions @xmath139 for @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "this means that the dressed state formalism or the @xmath21-dependent coupling method need not be employed to solve the equations .",
    "however , for consistency between the two calculations , the @xmath21-dependent tail - off is introduced exactly as it was used in @xcite .",
    "the photoassociation profiles represent the spontaneous loss from the excited state and are determined from the loss of unitarity of the @xmath25-matrix .",
    "the photon emission cross section for atoms colliding in the entrance channel @xmath142 is @xmath143 where @xmath77 and @xmath144 enumerate the open channels and @xmath145 is the wavenumber of channel @xmath77 .",
    "the photoassociation profile is then the average @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the number of open channels .",
    "profiles calculated using only the @xmath127 contributions are shown in the left hand plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : l0l4_comp ] .",
    "the laser interaction term in this case differs from that in the dipole approximation by the presence of @xmath128 . from the plot it is evident that , at large laser intensities , there are severe unphysical oscillations in the profiles .",
    "inclusion of all the terms in the @xmath129-summation that contribute ( @xmath148 ) does not noticeably affect the profiles .",
    "the photoassociation profiles for intensities of 64  mw/@xmath149 ( solid line ) and 640  mw/@xmath149 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the left hand plot includes only the @xmath127 term of the interaction coupling and hence only couplings to gerade metastable states .",
    "the right hand plot includes all terms of the @xmath129 summation and couplings to both gerade and ungerade metastable states . ]    to mitigate this problem ungerade @xmath150 metastable states , normally uncoupled in the dipole approximation , are introduced as open channels .",
    "the @xmath151 terms of the laser coupling contribute to these channels and the total loss profiles for this combination of states are presented in the right hand plot of fig .  [",
    "fig : l0l4_comp ] .",
    "these profiles exhibit more expected behavior and possess many similarities to the original pa profiles found using the dipole approximation .",
    "closer examination however ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : l4da_comp ] ) reveals that there is a large difference in behavior between the non - dipole and dipole approximation profiles , especially for high laser intensities . at low intensities",
    "the non - dipole profiles show a reduction in the background loss but the resonance peaks have the same shift and width , albeit with an increased resonance strength . at higher laser intensities ,",
    "the resonance parameters still remain identical but the resonances in the non - dipole profiles remain discernable for larger intensities than those in the dipole approximation profiles . in fact , the dipole approximation profiles demonstrate a saturation effect as the background overwhelms the resonance peaks . instead , in the non - dipole profiles , we observe that the resonance peaks decrease in strength such that the overall loss in the resonance region is smaller at higher intensities .",
    "this suggests possible optical suppression of photoassociative processes at high laser intensities .",
    "why this occurs is unknown , although it is likely due to destructive interference between the ungerade and gerade metastable channels .     the photoassociation profiles for intensities of 64  mw/@xmath149 ( solid line ) , 640  mw/@xmath149 ( dotted line ) and 3.9  w/@xmath149 ( dash - dot line ) .",
    "the left hand plot shows profiles that result from the use of the dipole approximation whereas the right hand plot includes the full summation of the non - dipole interaction coupling . ]",
    "the non - dipole coupling also introduces the possibility of more potential photoassociation channels , as the restriction @xmath1 is no longer enforced for summation terms @xmath152 . the likelihood that these couplings induce resonances in the excited state potentials",
    "is severely suppressed by the spherical bessel functions as @xmath153 for @xmath131 and @xmath154 ( i.e. within the region of bound levels ) .",
    "this prediction was tested by calculating profiles for photoassociation from the @xmath134 metastable levels to the @xmath135 , @xmath155 excited levels and , as expected , no resonances were visible at any laser intensity .    in summary ,",
    "the pa profiles presented here include all possible coupled metastable levels to the @xmath135 , @xmath136 excited state and have been computed without assuming the dipole approximation for the laser coupling .",
    "the new calculations using the non - dipole coupling do not modify the resonance parameters that are tabulated in table ii of @xcite to the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "the observed behavior of the background , and the influence of the dipole approximation , are not special to metastable helium but are a result of the weakly bound nature of the excited levels .",
    "it would be of much interest if a similar behavior were observed in photoassociation of another atomic species ."
