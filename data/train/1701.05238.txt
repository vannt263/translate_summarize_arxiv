    "understanding the behaviour of high energy hadron reactions from a fundamental perspective within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is an important goal of particle physics .",
    "one of the main open questions is the treatment of the diffractive processes , which are characterized by the presence of an intact hadron and large rapidity gaps in the final state ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "these processes are in general described in terms of a color singlet object : the pomeron ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this object , with the vacuum quantum numbers , was introduced phenomenologically in the regge theory as a simple moving pole in the complex angular momentum plane , to describe the high - energy behaviour of the total and elastic cross - sections of the hadronic reactions @xcite .",
    "the diffractive events are dominated by low transverse momentum processes , i.e. processes in which the strong running coupling constant is large and the useful perturbative methods are not valid .",
    "these processes are in general described by phenomenological models based on first principles of the quantum field theory and basic properties of qcd @xcite .",
    "it implies a large theoretical uncertainty , with a strong impact on the predictions for the magnitude and energy dependence of the diffractive cross section .",
    "for example , while some models @xcite predict that @xmath1 at asymptotic energies , other models @xcite predict @xmath2 . as a consequence ,",
    "the contribution of the diffractive events for the total cross sections at very high energies still is an open question .",
    "recent experimental results from the run 1 of the lhc have shed some light on the energy behaviour of the single and double diffractive cross sections @xcite and more precise results are expected in the run 2 @xcite .",
    "the expectation is that these data could be used to constrain the basic assumptions present in the phenomenological models , decreasing the uncertainty in its predictions at larger energies .",
    "the understanding of the hadronic interactions also is fundamental for the description of the ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) air showers @xcite , with the reconstruction of the primary uhecr properties being strongly dependent on the treatment of the diffractive and non - diffractive events present in the hadron  air interactions . due to the dominance of soft physics , the models of hadronic interactions in the generator models used in the simulation of extensive air showers ( eas ) are largely phenomenological and have to be extrapolated from accelerator energies , where they are calibrated , to the uhecr energies . in recent years ,",
    "the underlying theoretical framework present in these generators have been improved and the lhc data have been used to tuning the basic cross sections @xcite .",
    "however , the available collider data do not cover the full kinematic region of interest in uhecr interactions @xcite .",
    "in particular , experimental data for the particle production at very forward rapidities still are scarce , with its theoretical description still being an open question ( for a recent study see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as a consequence of the theoretical uncertainty present in the description of the hadronic interactions present in the eas , the air shower simulations still are one of the main source of systematic uncertainty in the interpretation of cosmic ray data @xcite .    our main goal in this paper is to give a quantitative estimate of the uncertainty associated to the treatment of the diffractive interactions on the shower observables .",
    "these interactions are expect to affect the development of the air showers , since diffractive interactions have direct impact on the inelasticity  the relative energy loss of the leading secondary particle  providing a way of transporting substantial amounts of energy deep in the atmosphere .",
    "consequently , they modify the global characteristics of the shower profile . in particular , a higher diffraction rate implies a slower eas development , modifying the position of the shower maximum @xmath3 , and a smaller number of secondaries in each interaction . in",
    "what follows we will study the impact of the diffractive interactions on ultra - high energy extensive air showers through the comparative analysis of the predictions for the eas observables from the standard versions of the sibyll @xcite , qgsjet @xcite and epos @xcite hadronic models , which are available in the framework of the corsika air shower simulation package @xcite .",
    "our study is strongly motivated by the analysis performed thirteen years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors have studied the same problem using the pre - lhc hadronic models and the aires program @xcite for the simulation of the eas development . in what follows",
    "we will update that analysis by considering the current hadronic models and include new results for fe - air collisions which were not considered in that reference . in order to investigate the contribution of these interactions , we will present , for each hadronic model , a comparison between predictions obtained using the full simulations , i.e. including the non - diffractive and diffractive events , with those derived excluding the diffractive events of the eas development . in particular , in section [ hadron ] we will compare the predictions of the different hadronic models for the distribution of number of secondaries , fraction of diffractive events , average fraction of pions and elasticity distributions , considering individual @xmath4-air and @xmath5-air collisions at different values for the primary energy .",
    "the impact on the eas observables is studied in section [ shower ] , where we will analyse the impact of the diffractive interactions on the longitudinal profiles of charged particles and muons as well as on the position of the shower maximum .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the treatment of the hadronic interactions in the air shower simulation codes is based on phenomenological models . in what follows",
    "we will consider the sibyll 2.1 , qgsjet  ii 04 and epos lhc models , present in the corsika package , and compare its predictions for distinct observables in @xmath4-air and @xmath5-air collisions at different center - of - mass energies . before to present our results , lets present a brief review of the main assumptions of the different phenomenological models ( for a more detailed review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "most current hadronic interaction models are based on basic quantum field theory principles , such as unitarity and analyticity of scattering amplitudes , and use gribov - regge theory @xcite of multi - pomeron exchange between nucleons as the basis for the treatment of high energy , soft interactions .",
    "perturbative qcd is considered to describe hard interactions with high transverse momentum , which becomes important at high energies . in general ,",
    "simplifications are made in the implementation of the hard processes if they are not directly relevant to the production of high energy secondaries .",
    "qgsjet and sibyll consider the eikonal model and assume unitarized cross sections with the real eikonal function being given by a sum of soft and hard contributions .",
    "epos also is based on gribov - regge theory and provides a energy - conserving quantum mechanical multiple scattering approach in terms of parton ladders . at high energies , nonlinear effects associated to",
    "the high partonic density becomes important and should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "qgsjet provides a microscopic treatment of nonlinear interaction effects in hadronic and nuclear collisions in terms of pomeron - pomeron interaction diagrams . on the other hand , in sibyll these effects",
    "are modelled by means of an energy - dependent cutoff for the minijet production .",
    "in contrast , epos employs a phenomenological approach for nonlinear interaction effects and address the energy - momentum correlations between multiple scattering processes at the amplitude level . the generalization from @xmath6 to @xmath7 and @xmath8 collisions",
    "is usually performed via glauber - gribov formalism @xcite , taking into account inelastic screening and low mass diffraction effects .",
    "finally , diffractive interactions are treated differently in the distinct models . in sibyll and qgsjet models ,",
    "the diffraction dissociation is described in terms of the good - walker formalism @xcite , where the colliding hadrons are represented by superpositions of elastic scattering eigenstates which undergo different absorption during the collision . in sibyll",
    ", high mass diffraction is described in terms of a 2 - channel eikonal approach . on the other hand ,",
    "the description of this process in qgsjet is based on all - order resummation of cut enhanced @xmath0 - diagrams .",
    "in contrast , a particular kind of pomeron is used to define a diffractive event in epos .",
    "depending of each event configuration it can be classified as non - diffractive , low mass diffraction without central particle production , or high mass diffraction .",
    "a basic feature of the diffractive interactions is that there is a leading particle whose energy is much larger than the energies of the other particles and the total number of secondaries is generally small .",
    "the resulting final states have a high elasticity . in previous studies ,",
    "these characteristics were used to tag the diffractive events @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in our study the classification of the diffractive and non - diffractive events was made using internal variables of the respective hadronic generators .",
    "in particular , in the epos lhc and qgsjet - ii 04 generators , the events were classified according to the variable typevt , which define the collision type : if typevt = 1 , the event is classified as non - diffractive ; otherwise , the event is considered a diffractive one . as this variable",
    "is read after the event is generated , it allows to reject diffractive events when generating samples of non - diffractive events .",
    "in contrast , in sibyll 2.1 , a hadron - air interaction is classified as diffractive requiring that there is only one wounded nucleon in the target ( nw = 1 ) and that the interaction with this nucleon is diffractive ( jdiff(0 ) > 0 ) .",
    "again , variables are read after the event have been generated . for nucleus - nucleus interactions , we implemented a distinct scheme for this model .",
    "as sibyll 2.1 treats nucleus - nucleus collisions in a semisuperposition model , where the _ a _ projectile nucleons are considered independent particles , it generates _ a _ superposed interactions .",
    "we found reasonable to classify as diffractive the collisions whose all superposed interactions were diffractive .",

    "the predictions of the three different hadronic generators are presented separately , with the diffractive events being represented by red squares and the non - diffractive one by light blue circles .",
    "we have that the most of the diffractive events appear on the region of low multiplicity and elasticity close to 1 , in agreement with the theoretical expectation . however , the distribution is different for the distinct hadronic models . in what follows , we will analyse the phenomenological implications of these differences .",

    "we assume that the target is a mixture of nitrogen , oxygen and argon , exactly as it is implemented in the corsika package @xcite .",
    "after the events have been generated , we register all secondaries , imposing a cutoff on the kinetic energy of the secondary particle . basically , we excluded from the secondary list all particles with kinetic energy smaller than 40 mev .",

    "as a consequence , the influence of these interactions on the number of secondaries and fraction of pions is strongly model dependent .",
    "we demonstrated that the predictions of these models for the elasticiy are distinct , which directly modifies the air shower development .",

    "moreover , we shown that the average longitudinal profile of muons is sensitive to the diffractive interactions , in particular for small zenithal angles .",
    "our results indicated that the diffractive interactions has a non - negligible influence on the observables and that the treatment of the diffractive physics is an important source of uncertainty in the description of the extensive air showers .",

    "<S> the understanding of the basic properties of the ultra - high energy extensive air showers is strongly dependent on the description of the hadronic interactions in a energy range beyond that probed by the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> one of the uncertainties present in the modeling of the air showers is the treatment of diffractive interactions , which are dominated by non - perturbative physics and usually described by phenomenological models . </S>",
    "<S> these interactions are expect to affect the development of the air showers , since they provide a way of transporting substantial amounts of energy deep in the atmosphere , modifying the global characteristics of the shower profile . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the impact of the diffractive interactions in the observables that can be measured in hadronic collisions at high energies and ultra - high energy cosmic ray interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three distinct phenomenological models for the treatment of diffractive physics and estimate the influence of these interactions on the elasticity , number of secondaries , longitudinal air shower profiles and muon densities for proton - air and iron - air collisions at different primary energies . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the diffractive events has a non - negligible effect on the observables and that the distinct approaches for these interactions , present in the phenomenological models , are an important source of theoretical uncertainty for the description of the extensive air showers . </S>"
