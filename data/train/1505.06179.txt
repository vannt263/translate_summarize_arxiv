    "at the beginning of the next decade , a variety of new galaxy surveys is expected to provide high precision data on galaxy clustering on very large scales . planned and proposed experiments such as the prime focus spectrograph ( pfs )  @xcite , desi  @xcite , spherex  @xcite , the square kilometre array ( ska )  @xcite",
    ", euclid  @xcite and wfirst  @xcite will probe cosmological volumes an order of magnitude larger than what has been provided by current surveys , so there is the need of a precise theoretical modeling of galaxy clustering .",
    "analyses of power spectrum and correlation function have been performed mainly using the so - called kaiser formalism  @xcite , that assumes ( other than linearity ) the plane - parallel approximation , and it also sets the two galaxies of the pair at the same redshift .",
    "classical analyses are also performed using newtonian approximations , and the validity of this approach breaks down when probing scales approaching the horizon , where quantities have to be defined in a gauge - invariant way consistently including perturbations of observed redshift and volume .",
    "theoretical models for galaxy clustering on large scales were developed and tested including wide angle corrections to the kaiser approximation and radial effects  @xcite , and , more recently , including all effects due to the fact that we observe galaxies on the physical , perturbed past light cone and not on some fictitious friedman background  @xcite .",
    "future galaxy surveys are an excellent opportunity to advance our understanding of cosmology in general and large scale structure ( lss ) in particular , e.g. via constraining the dark energy equation of state or by testing general relativity  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , joint analysis with cmb experiments @xcite will bring better constraints on the primordial universe .",
    "inflation models can be constrained studying , e.g. , the primordial power spectrum and features induced by primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "the latter affect the galaxy correlation function on very large scales .",
    "the interesting results of @xcite show that primordial non - gaussianity are detectable also via the two - point correlation function ( or its fourier transform , the power spectrum ) since they enter as a scale - dependence of the large - scale linear galaxy bias .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to study the cosmological dependence of relativistic effects and the error in parameter estimation introduced when those terms are neglected .",
    "we will also investigate which term is mainly responsible for the results obtained in  @xcite , and we extend their previous analysis to other cosmological parameters .",
    "we consider the ska and euclid surveys , consistently including galaxy bias , magnification bias and evolution bias .",
    "we study the number counts angular power spectra at first order in perturbation theory and perform a fisher matrix analysis to estimate cosmological parameters .",
    "our aim is not to forecast the most stringent and precise error bars for cosmological parameters , but to compare the standard newtonian analysis to the fully relativistic one . for this",
    "we assume rather conservative specifications .",
    "this yields relatively large error ellipses , but assures that our analysis is not affected by , e.g. , the treatment of non - linear scales or by too optimistic survey specifications .",
    "a detailed analysis of the goodness of the constraints per se is left as a future work including forecasts based on markov chain monte carlo methods .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : correlations ] we introduce the formalism used throughout the paper and in section  [ sec : surveys ] we present the surveys specifications used to model number density as a function of redshift , the galaxy bias , the magnification , the evolution bias and discuss our fisher analysis . in section  [ sec :",
    "cosmology ] we investigate how relativistic effects can be used to constrain cosmological models and what is their effect on parameter estimation , and in section  [ sec : cosdep ] we show that relativistic effects contain cosmological information , and so they can in principle be used to constrain cosmological models .",
    "our results on how neglecting relativistic effects can modify the predicted cosmological measurements of future surveys are summarized in section  [ sec : results ] , and we discuss our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "appendix [ sec : fnl_class ] describes our implementation of primordial non - gaussianity into the class code .",
    "we can not observe galaxies in real physical space at constant time .",
    "we observe them on our background light cone .",
    "actually , for each galaxy we observe its direction @xmath0 in the sky as well as its redshift @xmath1 .",
    "taking into account that this redshift is perturbed by peculiar velocities is the well known `` redshift space distortion '' originally pointed out by kaiser  @xcite .",
    "however , also the gravitational potential induces an apparent redshift modification and the direction into which we see the galaxy may not be the one into which the photons have been emitted . taking into account all these relativistic effects to first order",
    ", one can define the _ observed _ galaxy over - density @xmath2 at fixed observed redshift and into a given observed direction @xmath0 .",
    "this is an observable and therefore gauge - invariant quantity which involves not only the density fluctuation and the velocity but also the bardeen potentials @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the fact that this expression is more complicated than the simple kaiser formalism is not only a difficulty , but as we shall show , also an opportunity .",
    "it means that the number counts contain information not only on the density but also , e.g. , about lensing , which is relevant and does affect cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "the total overdensity @xmath5 is not anymore just the _ local _ density field , but it is comprised also by _ integrated _ terms that correspond to lensing , time - delay and integrated sachs - wolf effects , due to the impact of cosmological perturbations on the path of photons .",
    "we can then express the total _ observed _ over - density as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 refers to the overdensity in the comoving gauge , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are peculiar veolcity ( redshift space distortions in the kaiser approximation ) and doppler effects , @xmath10 contains lensing convergence and @xmath11 incorporates local and non local terms depending on bardeen potentials and their temporal derivatives .",
    "the definition of these in terms of standard linear perturbation variables are given in appendix  [ sec : fnl_class ] .",
    "there we also present the transfer functions of these terms , including galaxy bias @xmath12 , magnification bias @xmath13 ( in the literature also the quantity @xmath14 is sometimes used ) and evolution bias @xmath15 ( sometimes called @xmath16 ) .    in figure  [ fig : geometry ] we illustrate the apparent modifications to the position of a galaxy due to all the effects mentioned ; in the `` standard '' case the only effect present is the one due to the kaiser approximation for peculiar velocities that causes a spherical distribution in comoving coordinates space , to be observed as squashed along the line of sight ( see e.g. figure  1 of  @xcite ) . in the relativistic treatment",
    "there are also contributions from lensing convergence @xmath10 and gravitational potential terms , that cause an apparent modification to the angular and radial position , respectively .",
    "the convergence @xmath10 is normally anti - correlated with the overdensity @xmath7 but the magnification bias which enters with the opposite sign can dominate it , especially at high redshift , see , e.g. figure  12 of  @xcite .",
    "because of this , a distribution of galaxies may appear more or less compact .",
    "finally , the gravitational potential terms directly involve bardeen potentials , their time derivatives and their integrals along the line of sight ( time - delay and integrated sachs - wolf effects ) .",
    "these correlations have been investigated recently in  @xcite , and it has been shown that , for radial correlations with a large @xmath17 , relativistic terms can be a significant contribution to the correlation  @xcite .    since @xmath2 is a function of direction and redshift , its power spectra are defined for two redshifts @xmath1 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , see  @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ sec : fnl_class ] we define the transfer function @xmath20 of the number counts given in equation  ( [ eq : deltas ] ) .",
    "this computes the contribution to @xmath21 from wave number @xmath22 estimated in a bin with mean redshift @xmath23 and window function @xmath24 . from the transfer function ,",
    "the angular power spectra are determined by integration over the primordial curvature spectrum  @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbations .",
    "the superscript @xmath24 indicates that these transfer already include an integral over the window function @xmath24 .",
    "more details are given in appendix  [ sec : fnl_class ] .",
    "we note that in the standard analysis of power spectra @xmath27 it is customary to use only auto - correlations within a certain redshift bin of a galaxy survey , and not the cross - bin correlations as redshift bins are treated as independent . in the following",
    "we show that it is important to be able to model consistently cross - bin correlations , since they are dominated by the non - negligible lensing convergence @xmath10 .",
    "this is very interesting since @xmath10 is the ( spherical ) laplacian of the lensing potential @xmath28 , hence their spectra are related by @xmath29 ^ 2c^\\psi_\\ell$ ] .",
    "therefore , if galaxy surveys are sensitive to @xmath10 , we can in principle use them to determine the lensing potential , usually inferred by shear measurements .",
    "to investigate the observational consequences of including relativistic corrections we consider two examples of future surveys : the hi galaxy survey planned with the ska  @xcite as an example of a spectroscopic survey , and the euclid photometric survey  @xcite .",
    "we use specifications for ska which are consistent with the @xmath30jy cut of @xcite , and the photometric specifications for the euclid survey . in figure",
    "[ fig : nzbz ] ,  [ fig : sz ] we plot the predicted number of galaxies , galaxy bias and magnification bias that we will use for our forecasts .",
    "the number of galaxies per steradian and per unit redshift for ska @xcite is given by : @xmath31 we use @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; the survey covers @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 . we divide the survey into 5 bins of equal depth @xmath37 in the range @xmath38 .    for the euclid photometric survey we use : @xmath39 \\ , , \\,\\,\\ , 0<z<2 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath40 and the median redshift is @xmath41 ; @xmath42 .",
    "this number density is consistent with the official specification for the density of galaxies , @xmath43 .    in both cases",
    ", these specifications will give a total number of sources detected of @xmath44 .      the galaxy bias for ska",
    "is approximated as @xcite : @xmath45 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 .    as for euclid , we model the galaxy bias as : @xmath48    these fits",
    "are conveniently taken into account in the implementation of primordial non - gaussianities discussed in appendix  ( [ sec : fnl_class ] ) .",
    "the _ rsd _ and _ pot _ terms also include evolution bias , @xmath15 , ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that new galaxies form so that the true number density of galaxies does not simply scale like @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the cosmological scale factor .",
    "the evolution bias is given by : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the conformal time and @xmath53 is the hubble parameter . here",
    "@xmath54 indicates the true number density of galaxies ( not necessarily observed ) per redshift and per solid angle present in the universe above a certain threshold @xmath55 in luminosity .",
    "it can be estimated from the luminosity function @xcite .",
    "however , given the uncertainties in the modelling of galaxy evolution , for simplicity as in @xcite we assume that the observed @xmath56 in figure [ fig : nzbz ] still gives a good approximation to estimate @xmath15 .",
    "this comes from the fact that the evolution bias only appears in subleading terms ( wide - angle velocity and _ pot _ ) so that uncertainties in its modeling do not significantly affect our results .",
    "for ska we interpolate the results of @xcite to @xmath30jy : @xmath57 with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and use a constant @xmath61 within each bin centered at @xmath23 .",
    "we use the magnification bias for the photometric euclid survey computed in  @xcite , given by the fit : @xmath62 with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this result is consistent also with other analyses , e.g.  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : sz ] we plot the magnification bias used in this work .",
    "we modified the class code to introduce a magnification bias @xmath61 depending on the central redshift @xmath23 of each bin .",
    "cosmic magnification changes the relative number of sources detected at a given redshift and fixed magnitude limit , and in this way lensing can modify the effect of cosmological parameter variations on clustering ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath67 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath68 are the observed and intrinsic number of sources , respectively , @xmath69 is the magnification bias and @xmath10 is the convergence .",
    "we stress that this effect modifies the effect of primordial non - gaussianity also , due to changes in the relative redshift distribution of observed sources , and so lensing effects are important for measurements of @xmath70 , a fact that is not often taken into consideration .      in order to predict the constraining power of a survey one often uses a fisher matrix analysis  @xcite .",
    "the fisher matrix , @xmath71 , indicates how well a given set of cosmological parameters @xmath72 under consideration can be measured .",
    "the bigger the fisher matrix elements , the better the parameters can be determined by the given survey . if the errors ( in the parameters ) would be gaussian , the ellipsoid in parameter space given by : @xmath73 where the inverse regularized gamma function gives the difference to the minimum @xmath74 as @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 degrees of freedom , respectively .",
    "this determines the 1@xmath78 error bars or 68% confidence region of parameter space around some fiducial values @xmath79 . in reality errors",
    "are not gaussian but the fisher ellipses usually still give a reasonable indication of the precision with which a given parameter can be determined . in our situation , where we measure the @xmath80 with a certain precision @xmath81 , the fisher matrix is given by : @xmath82}^{-2 } } \\ , ,   \\label{eq : fisher}\\ ] ] where the derivative is evaluated at fiducial values @xmath83 and @xmath81 are errors in the power spectra . for gaussian fluctuations they can be determined by wick s theorem and are given by ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath84 } } = \\frac{\\tilde{c}_{\\ell}^{\\rm ( ip ) } \\tilde{c}_{\\ell}^{\\rm ( jq ) } + \\tilde{c}_{\\ell}^{\\rm ( iq ) } \\tilde{c}_{\\ell}^{\\rm ( jp)}}{(2\\ell+1)f_{\\rm sky } } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath85 denote the observed correlation multipoles which include shot noise errors : @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the average number of sources per steradian within the bin @xmath23 . even with primordial non gaussianity this is a good approximation for the error in the power spectra .",
    "note that we sum over the matrix indices @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 with @xmath91 which run from 1 to the number of bins .    to perform the fisher analysis , we parameterize our cosmology using the following parameters : @xmath92 we have set spatial curvature @xmath93 ; @xmath94 parameterizes the present hubble parameter , @xmath95km / s / mpc ; @xmath96 parameterize the dark energy equation of state , @xmath97 ; @xmath98 are the primordial power spectral index and its running ( see definition in the next section ) ; @xmath99 are the density parameters of cold dark matter and of baryons respectively ; @xmath100 are the primordial non - gaussianity parameter and its spectral tilt ( see definition in the next section ) .",
    "we choose the fiducial values @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .    in doing a real data analysis",
    ", one should use the range @xmath108 , but this requires involved algorithms to carefully exclude non - linear scales @xcite and to compute the beginning of the quasi - linear regime when cross - correlating different redshift bins .",
    "here we are mostly interested in a first assessment of the importance of relativistic effects as compared to the standard analysis , so to simplify our study , we assume a conservative @xmath109200 at all redshifts",
    ". even if some of the relativistic effects are more sensitive to low multipoles , such a conservative cut on non - linear scale does not bias our constraints towards an ad - hoc enhancement of relativistic effects compared the newtonian case .",
    "in fact some of the most relevant terms ( e.g. lensing ) also affect high multipoles , see figures  [ fig : cls_ska ] ,  [ fig : cls_euclid ] .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate the impact of relativistic corrections on galaxy clustering analyses and their constraining power by looking at the predicted @xmath110 from future galaxy surveys .",
    "we focus on constraints on dark energy and on the parameters defining the initial perturbations . note that we are studying the impact of relativistic terms relative to the newtonian ones and",
    "we do not perform a forecast of survey capabilities ; a detailed analysis of survey specifications and observational strategies together with an mcmc analysis including the nuisance parameters of the survey is required to correctly assess the proper forecasted measurements for specific instruments .",
    "this is not the focus of this work .    in this paper",
    "we compare constraints using a traditional analysis ( but including wide - angle and local relativistic corrections ; see  @xcite for more details ) with a fully relativistic one .",
    "we want to study how much information is present in the relativistic terms which have been neglected in the past . in order to do this ,",
    "we compare two fisher matrix analyses : the newtonian case , referred to as `` nwt '' where we include intrinsic clustering plus peculiar velocity effects ( in the formalism of equation  [ eq : deltas ] , this corresponds to the first two terms ) , using only auto - correlation functions within the redshift bins used , and the fully relativistic case , referred to as `` rel '' where we include all the terms and also cross - bin correlations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cls_ska ] ,  [ fig : cls_euclid ] we compare the angular power spectra in the newtonian and relativistic case for the ska ( spectroscopic ) and euclid ( photometric ) , respectively . in the plots we refer to @xmath111 to indicate the correlations @xmath112 . in the case of spectroscopic surveys we assume top hat bins , while we use gaussian bins in the case of photometric surveys ; more details on the modeling and computation of @xmath112 are given in appendix  [ sec : fnl_class ] .",
    "in both cases , small differences are visible in the auto - correlations , with larger differences at small @xmath113 ; on the cross - bin correlations the differences are very large , because these correlations are dominated by the lensing convergence term .",
    "in particular , non adjacent bin cross - correlations are nearly zero in the newtonian case for spectroscopic surveys , as expected .",
    "we note that oscillations in e.g. the @xmath114 case plotted here are not physical but due to numerical precision for such low ( negligible ) amplitudes .",
    "this justifies the standard assumption that in spectroscopic surveys the cross - bin correlations contain virtually no cosmological information , but , as firstly noted in  @xcite , we stress the fact that in the relativistic case , gravitational potential and lensing convergence effects introduce radial cross - bin large correlations .",
    "nearest cross - bin correlations , e.g. @xmath115 from euclid are in general larger compared to the ska ones in the newtonian case , because photometric redshift uncertainties assumed for euclid cause an effective cross - bin overlap ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this means that local newtonian term are still non - negligible compared to the integrated relativistic ones .",
    "we will investigate the cosmological information present in these correlations in the rest of this section .",
    "the first step towards understanding the nature of dark energy is to clarify whether it is a simple cosmological constant or whether it originates from a dynamical degree of freedom , i.e. it varies with time .",
    "dynamical dark energy can be distinguished from the cosmological constant by considering the evolution of the equation of state of dark energy , @xmath116 , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the pressure and energy density of the `` dark energy fluid '' , respectively . for a cosmological constant model , @xmath119 , while for dynamical models @xmath120 , where @xmath50 is normalized to unity today , @xmath121 .    to evaluate the potential to constrain the dynamics of different models of dark energy with galaxy surveys , we adopt the following simple phenomenological parameterization for the dark energy equation - of - state ( eos ) @xmath122",
    "@xcite : @xmath123    in figure  [ fig : de ] we show the constraints on these dynamical dark energy parameters for the ska and euclid , marginalized over other cosmological parameters ( here and throughout the entire paper we will show 1-@xmath78 constraints ) .",
    "it can be seen that , as expected , differences in the estimation of the errors are larger in the photometric case",
    ". we will quantify the error on the forecasted errors in the determination of dynamical dark energy parameters in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "for spectroscopic surveys , including lensing , and especially when magnification bias @xmath13 is consistently included , actually degrades the precision with which @xmath124 can be determined by this observation .",
    "we study how large - scale correlations can be used to test the initial conditions of scalar perturbations .",
    "in particular , we focus on the spectral index , @xmath125 of the power spectrum and its running , @xmath126 as well as the primordial non - gaussianity parameter @xmath70 and its spectral tilt @xmath127 .",
    "inflation predicts a spectrum of primordial curvature and density perturbations that are the seeds of cosmic structure which forms as the universe expands and cools . this initial spectrum , and in particular its spectral index @xmath125 is a key observable for understanding inflation .",
    "the spectrum is defined by : @xmath128 the dirac - delta is a consequence of statistical homogeneity and because of",
    "statistical isotropy @xmath129 only depends on the modulus of @xmath130 .",
    "the spectral index @xmath125 is given by : @xmath131 where @xmath132 denotes the pivot scale which is usually chosen to be a scale to which a given experiment is most sensitive . given this , and to simplify the comparison with cmb experiments @xcite , we choose @xmath133mpc .",
    "the quantity @xmath134 is also called the spectral tilt .",
    "inflation predicts a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of primordial density fluctuations , i.e. @xmath135 and a nearly scale independent tilt , i.e. @xmath125 nearly independent of the pivot scale .",
    "we characterize a possible scale dependence of @xmath125 by : @xmath136 the quantity @xmath126 is called the `` running '' of the spectral index .    figure  [ fig : ns ] shows the constraints on power spectrum spectral index parameters , marginalized over the other cosmological parameters .",
    "the effects of integrated terms is in this case smaller , and in the case of spectroscopic surveys , neglecting relativistic effects will induce only a @xmath137 error in the estimated precision , as we will see in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "it is however worth noting that the results here are obtained by marginalizing over the remaining cosmological parameters , while in section  [ sec : results ] we fix them . in the photometric case ,",
    "on the other hand , relativistic effects contribute significantly to the information content of galaxy clustering over the entire survey .",
    "an important goal for forthcoming cosmological experiments is to test whether initial conditions of cosmological perturbations deviate from gaussianity .",
    "this is very interesting as standard slow roll single field inflation predicts very small non - gaussanities  @xcite .",
    "this can be tested using cmb data ( @xcite and references therein ) or using galaxy catalogs  @xcite .",
    "constraining primordial non - gaussianity offers a powerful test of the generation mechanism of cosmological perturbations in the early universe . while standard single - field models of slow - roll inflation lead to small departures from gaussianity , non - standard scenarios ( such as e.g. multi - field inflation ) allow for a larger level of non - gaussianity ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a widely used parameterization of primordial non - gaussianity is the @xmath70 parameterization , that includes a quadratic correction to the potential : @xmath138 where @xmath139 denotes the bardeen potential , which , on sub - hubble scales reduces to the usual newtonian gravitational potential . here",
    "@xmath140 is a gaussian random field , and the second term , when @xmath70 is not zero , gives the deviation from gaussianity . in this paper",
    "we refer to the so - called  local type \" @xmath70 .",
    "we use the lss convention ( as opposed to the cmb one , where @xmath141 see @xcite and appendix  [ sec : fnl_class ] ) .",
    "one method for constraining non - gaussianity from large - scale structure surveys exploits the fact that a positive @xmath70 corresponds to positive skewness of the density probability distribution , and hence an increased number of massive objects  @xcite . in particular , @xmath70 introduces a scale - dependent modification of the large - scale halo bias . the difference from the usual gaussian bias",
    "is given by  @xcite : @xmath142",
    "f_{\\rm nl}(k)\\delta_{\\rm ec } \\frac{3 \\omega_{0m}h_0 ^ 2}{c^2k^2t(k)d(z)},\\ ] ] where @xmath143 is the usual bias calculated assuming gaussian initial conditions , which we assume to be scale - independent , @xmath144 is the linear growth factor , @xmath145 is the matter density parameter today and @xmath146 is the critical value of the matter overdensity for ellipsoidal collapse .",
    "we choose to approximate it by the spherical collapse value @xmath147 @xcite .    while generally the parameter @xmath70 is assumed to be scale - independent , some inflationary models predicts a scale - dependent @xmath70 , see e.g.  @xcite for more details .",
    "the running parameter @xmath148 is expected to be @xmath149 in most inflationary models .",
    "its signatures in the cmb and lss have been discussed in the literature , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we consider the scenario that isolates the multi - field effects as in  @xcite , for which the effective @xmath150 becomes : @xmath151 where we choose the pivot scale @xmath152mpc to easily compare analyses of the cmb @xcite .",
    "effects of primordial non - gaussianity on the bias are relevant on large scales due to the factor @xmath153 like the relativistic effects  @xcite , so we may encounter a certain degree of degeneracy .",
    "however , as their angular dependence is different , they can in principle be distinguished in a multipole expansion  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ng ] shows the constraints on primordial non - gaussianity parameters , marginalized over other cosmological parameters .",
    "we can see that in this case neglecting large - scale effects has a large impact , confirming , with a different analysis , the findings of  @xcite .",
    "we expect that in general lensing convergence is the dominant term in the radial cross - bin correlations ( see  @xcite ) , but since lensing is a tracer of the matter distribution and insensitive to galaxy bias , it is usually not taken into account when estimating non - gaussianity from lss .",
    "however , cosmic magnification effects , as from see equation  [ eq : cosmag ] , modify the effect of @xmath70 on clustering .    the variation in the ellipses is again larger in the photometric case , but it is still of @xmath154 for spectroscopic surveys .",
    "we stress again that our results here are not a prediction of the final constraining power of future surveys .",
    "several differences between our analysis and the ones of e.g.  @xcite give us different predicted constraints for the ska ( e.g. the number of bins , number of parameters over which we marginalize , inclusion of running of @xmath70 ) .",
    "given the precision in the measurements of non - gaussianity parameters that is forecasted for future galaxy surveys when performing an optimized analysis  @xcite , a @xmath154 effect on the estimate of the error can be important for drawing theoretical conclusions from observations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : ng ] , including relativistic effects changes the degeneracy between @xmath70 and @xmath148 .",
    "in this section we investigate the cosmological information present in the relativistic corrections , given by the lensing and gravitational terms of equation  ( [ eq : deltas ] ) .    as stated in section  [ sec : correlations ] , lensing and gravitational potential contributions modify the observed correlations , acting as corrections to the intrinsic clustering . here",
    "we study the information contained in these relativistic corrections , by isolating them and performing a fisher analysis using signal coming only from these effects ( i.e. excluding galaxy clustering signal ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cosdep_lengr ] we show the constraints on cosmological parameters obtained by isolating the relativistic contributions .",
    "we marginalize over the cosmological parameters not considered in the given ellipse .",
    "clearly , these terms depend on cosmological parameters , so they can in principle be used for testing cosmological models , if they can be isolated ; but more importantly , neglecting them in an analysis causes a bias of the results .",
    "the constraining power of the integrated terms is of course smaller than the analysis that include galaxy clustering , but we can see how there clearly is some cosmological information in these correlations , and this explains the change it the ellipses in section  [ sec : cosmology ] .    it is interesting to note the nearly perfect degeneracy in the @xmath155 plane .",
    "lensing is very sensitive to the combination @xmath156 , which it constrains to be @xmath157 .",
    "these results also suggest that futuristic surveys or improved analyses ( e.g. using the so called multi - tracer technique , or specifically planned observations targeting galaxy samples with a very large magnification bias ) could provide a complementary test for cosmological models .",
    "in particular , integrated terms may contain additional information on the model of gravity ; an analysis of this for the @xmath158 model can be found in  @xcite , and we will present a general investigation in a follow - up paper .",
    "to quantify and summarize our results , we construct figures of merit ( fom ) describing parameters of cosmological models .",
    "these are given by the inverse of the area of the error ellipses shown in the previous figures , see e.g.  @xcite for details . to properly quantify the error in the forecasted precision in measuring cosmological parameters introduced when neglecting relativistic effects , we then define the ratio : @xmath159 \\right ) ^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath160 describe the model parameters we want to test , and @xmath161 is the sub - matrix of the fisher matrix of the parameters @xmath162 .",
    "this corresponds to fixing other parameters ; clearly , the larger the fom the better the given parameters are determined by the experiment .",

    "[ fig : fom ] we show the errors in the in the predicted constraining power when performing a full relativistic analysis compared to the standard newtonian analysis for all parameter subsets .",
    "we can see that in most cases there is a significant difference in the fom for cosmological models when using a full relativistic analysis rather than a standard newtonian one .",
    "this shows that a precise calculation of the fom for future surveys requires a proper relativistic formulation of galaxy clustering .",
    "the largest effects are on the estimate of the matter content of the universe and parameters describing primordial non - gaussanity .",
    "as described in the previous sections , effects are larger for photometric surveys , due to the fact that photometric bins will cause an increased importance of the integrated radial terms coming from lensing and gravitational potential with respect to the intrinsic galaxy clustering signal .",
    "in this paper we investigate the effect of including relativistic corrections to galaxy clustering on the constraining power of future galaxy surveys such as ska and euclid , by using the directly observable angular power spectra .",
    "we study how cosmological parameter estimation is affected by relativistic terms by comparing the fully relativistic result with a standard newtonian analysis .",
    "we also show that cosmic magnification together with other relativistic terms , via their effective `` redistribution '' of galaxies in redshift space , introduce a bias on the constraints on cosmological , including non - gaussianity parameters , and so it will need to be taken into account when forecasting measurements of e.g. @xmath70 .",
    "we analyze separately the integrated relativistic terms to determine their individual contributions to the signal and we show that they contain cosmological information . while the constraining power of the relativistic terms is smaller than the one of the standard density and redshift space distortion terms , neglecting them leads to a considerable bias in the estimated precision in the measurements of cosmological parameters describing the models for dark energy and for the initial perturbations .",
    "we quantify our findings in section  [ sec : results ] , and we show that the error in neglecting relativistic terms is on the order of tens of percent , and of @xmath163 in most cases considered in this work .",
    "future surveys aiming to measure cosmological parameters with high precision and to set strict constraints on theoretical models will then need to take properly into account radial correlations and relativistic terms in order to not bias their results .",
    "we do nt perform a detailed analysis of the constraining power of the surveys , as that is beyond the scope of this work ; we expect the fom to improve with the number of bins , that we keep to 5 , in order to speed up computations and to have an easier understanding of the different contributions to the final results .",
    "even though in slimmer bins the shot noise is increased due to the smaller number of galaxies , also the signal is increased since there is less `` smearing out '' of the dominant fluctuations on smaller scales so that the noise increase can be compensated ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "it is an interesting future project to see how much can be gained by significantly increasing the number of bins .",
    "finally we want to note that the angular power spectrum approach of projecting sources on a single value of z within the redshift bin misses the radial information in it .",
