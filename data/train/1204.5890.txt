    "as a recent development , the possibility of discrimination between quantum states can be potentially useful for many applications in quantum computation and quantum communication . in this problem",
    ", a quantum state is chosen from a set of known states but we do not know which and want to determine the actual states .",
    "if the states in the set are not orthogonal , it can not be successfully identified with unit probability because of the non - cloning theorem .",
    "two basic strategies have been introduced to achieve the state discrimination , one of which is the minimum - error discrimination @xcite and the other is the unambiguous discrimination @xcite . in the minimum - error discrimination , errors are permitted and the optimum measurement is required such that the probability of error is minimum . in the unambiguous discrimination",
    "not errors but inconclusive results are permitted , and in the optimum strategy the probability of failure is a minimum .",
    "recently , testing quantum mechanics for large space distances and eventually in implementing quantum information protocols in global scales attract a lot of interest  @xcite .",
    "photon is an ideal physical object in quantum communications . because of",
    "the present limits on the use of fiber optics in long distance communications , the most feasible alternative may be free - space transmission using satellites and ground stations . and then theoretical studies on the influence of the detector velocity are demanded by using satellites in quantum information experiments . in this paper",
    ", we address this issue by considering the discrimination between two photon polarizations when the measurements performed in different inertial frames are allowed .",
    "pure polarization states for two monochromatic photons with different momenta can unambiguously distinguished in moving frames , while the polarizations of two non - monochromatic photons can not .",
    "following the proposals in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective reduced density matrix for the polarizations can be defined and calculated in moving frames , and the polarization states can be distinguished with minimum error .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we give a brief description of basis transformation under the lorentz boost . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we discuss the discrimination between two pure polarizations of two monochromatic photons in moving frames . how to calculate the effect reduced density matrix for photon polarizations is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , and numeric results are shown for the minimum - error discrimination between polarizations of two non - monochromatic photons . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we compare the holevo bound and polarization discrimination . finally , the paper is ended with a short discussion in sec .",
    "to give the state transformation in different frames , we should first discuss the photon basis states .",
    "we define the standard vector @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , as follows @xmath2 and for photons @xmath3 .",
    "the momentum - helicity eigenstates can be generated from the standard vector @xmath0 , @xmath4 is a four - component null vector , @xmath5 and the helicity is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the choice of lorentz transformation @xmath7 is not unique @xcite and in the present paper we set @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a pure lorentz boost along @xmath10 axis taking @xmath11 to @xmath12 and @xmath13 denotes a rotation taking the vector @xmath14 to the vector @xmath15 . in polar",
    "coordinate , @xmath16 , and @xmath13 can be chosen as @xmath17 the carrier space @xmath18 of the irreducible representation of the poincar group for photons is spanned by the momentum - helicity eigenstates @xmath19 and the basis are normalized by @xmath20    a lorentz boost @xmath21 will induce a unitary operator @xmath22 on the hilbert space @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath23 where the wigner rotation @xmath24 is an element in the little group which leaves @xmath11 invariant . for massless particles ,",
    "the little group is the @xmath25 group and in eq .",
    "( [ wr ] ) @xmath26 is just a rotation or translation in the @xmath27-@xmath28 plane .",
    "since the helicity is not affected by translations , only a rotation by an angle @xmath29 is left , and then @xmath30 the angle @xmath29 is explicitly given in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath31 for different lorentz transforms and momenta , where @xmath32 since all the lorentz boosts can be constructed by @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and @xmath36 @xmath37 for all @xmath21 any momentum @xmath38 can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "now , we can use the two helicity states as a basis for the polarization states .",
    "the four - vectors of helicity states corresponding to momentum @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the helicity vectors corresponding to the standard basis states @xmath0 and @xmath13 is the rotation taking the standard space direction @xmath42 to @xmath43 , given in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "the polarization state @xmath44 for a photon with momentum @xmath39 can be expressed as @xmath45 . and a generic one - photon state is given by a wave - package  @xcite @xmath46 normalized by @xmath47 with the lorentz - invariant measure @xmath48 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , the transformation for the polarization under lorentz boost @xmath21 is @xmath49 when the lorentz boost is along the @xmath10 axis , it can be simplified as @xmath50",
    "the polarized photon is an essential tool for both quantum communication and quantum computation . in quantum communication , optical fibers",
    "are usually used , and the photons may be absorbed or depolarized owing to the fiber s imperfections . in some cases , such as communication with space stations , the photons must propagate and the beam then has a diffraction angle .",
    "these mean that the photons are usually not monochromatic and have a momentum distribution in quantum communication . in this section , for simplicity",
    ", we discuss the idea case , where the photons are monochromatic .",
    "it will be shown that the photon polarizations can be unambiguous distinguished in this case . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss a more realistic case , where the photons are non - monochromatic .",
    "let us assume that alice prepares a single photon in one of the two polarization states @xmath51 and @xmath52 with equal probabilities .",
    "besides the polarization freedom , the photon also has momentum freedom , and we assume that the two polarizations have two momenta @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . in this case , the photon corresponds to plane wave pulse .",
    "the receiver bob tries to unambiguously distinguish the two polarization states .",
    "we consider the effect of bob s motion relative to alice , with a constant velocity @xmath55 . for convenience ,",
    "we restrict that @xmath55 is along @xmath56 .",
    "a coordinate system in alice s rest frame can be selected such that @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "and we suppose the receiver bob has an infinite flat detetcor parallel to @xmath27-@xmath28 plane . in this paper , @xmath60",
    "and we choose the zero - components of the momenta to be unit , because according to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , the transformations for polarizations are independent on the magnitude of the momentum @xmath39 .",
    "the lorentz transformation yields momenta s new components in bob s rest frame , @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "new unit vectors of momenta in bob s rest frame are @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , the new polarization states are @xmath66    to unambiguously distinguish the two polarizations , the povm detection operators for the optimum discrimination should be given .",
    "let the elements of povm be @xmath67 , corresponding to unambiguously detecting @xmath68 , @xmath69 , corresponding to unambiguously detecting @xmath70 and @xmath71 , corresponding to inconclusive result .",
    "the condition of no errors requires that @xmath72 and in addition , because the povm exhausts all possibilities , it is implied that @xmath73 the probabilities of successfully identifying the two polarization states is @xmath74 the optimal povm detection operators satisfying eqs .",

( [ eq3 ] ) shows that the optimum successful probability @xmath80 is dependent on the velocity @xmath81 . to make it more obvious , we consider an example alice prepares @xmath82 and @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 and",
    "then in bob s rest frame @xmath87 and @xmath88 we see from eq .",
    "( [ overlap ] ) that the overlap between the two polarization states changes for different observers .",
    "this conclusion is reasonable since the transformation for photon polarization in different frames is dependent on the photon s momentum , which is shown in eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) .",
    "finally , the optimal successful possibilities are given as @xmath89 the results are shown in fig .",
    "when @xmath90 or @xmath91 , the optimum probabilities @xmath80 are the same in different frames and there is no influence on the discrimination between the two polarizations , because the transformations for the two polarization states are the same .",
    "howerver , if @xmath92 , the optimal probability of unambiguous discrimination between the two polarization states is sensitive to bob s relative velocity to alice .",
    "it is obvious in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] that @xmath93 drops as @xmath81 increase .",
    "when bob moves toward the opposite direction of z axis , with the magnitude of the velocity large enough ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath93 can become arbitrarily close to 1 , which means the two polarization states can almost be perfectly distinguished even if alice prepares two nonorthogonal polarization states .",
    "this shows how important the detector motion can be to polarization measurements when the velocity is high enough .",
    "as mentioned before , the photons in quantum communication are usually non - monochromatic , and in this section , we will discuss the more realistic case .",
    "assume that alice prepares a single photon in one of the two helicity states .",
    "in the long - range propagation of the polarized photon , due to the imperfections of fiber or the diffraction in the free space , the photon may have a momentum distribution , and the corresponding one - photon states read @xmath95 where @xmath96 represents the momentum distribution .",
    "for simplify , we suppose that the momenta have a gaussian distribution and the dispersion is restricted to @xmath97 plane , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 is a normalization factor . to discriminate between the two polarization states , we should first calculate the reduced density matrix for the polarizations . following the proposals in ref .",
    "@xcite , an longitudinal ( unphysical ) part of a polarization state @xmath100 can be defined as @xmath101 .",
    "a polarization state along the @xmath27 axis is @xmath102 here , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "the transverse part of @xmath105 is @xmath106 and @xmath107 can be obtained .",
    "then , we can define @xmath108 then , the effective reduced density matrix for polarization of a one - photon state @xmath109 can be expressed as @xmath110 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , in a moving frame with relative velocity @xmath111 , the reduced polarization density matrix can be obtained @xmath112    using eq .",
    "( [ reduced ] ) , we can calculate the reduced density matrix @xmath113 for @xmath114 in bob s frame . and at this point , the above unambiguous state discrimination is not appropriate for this case because the two spaces supported by @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the same .",
    "but we can still distinguish them with the minimum - error strategy .",
    "for minimum - error discrimination inconclusive results do not occur , so that @xmath117 and we require that the probability of errors in the discrimination procedure is a minimum",
    ".    the error probability can be expressed as @xmath118.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] introducing the operator @xmath119 , and it is obvious that the minimum of the error probability is obtained when @xmath120 is the projector onto those eigenstates @xmath121 of @xmath122 that belong to negative eigenvalues @xmath123 .",
    "the optimum detection operators therefore read @xmath124 where @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 for @xmath128 . clearly , the optimal minimum - error measurement for discriminating between two quantum states is a von neumann measurement .",
    "the resulting minimum - error probability is @xcite @xmath129 for any operator @xmath130 , the operator @xmath131 is defined as @xmath132 .",
    "next , we perform a numerical investigation of eq .",
    "( [ pe ] ) .",
    "[ f2 ] shows the minimum - error probability of discrimination between @xmath115 and @xmath116 vs bob s velocity @xmath81 relative to alice , for @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , respectively . here , @xmath136 is the wave packet width , and @xmath137 .",
    "we see that when bob moves along the opposite direction of z axis , @xmath138 drops as @xmath81 decreases . however , there is a maximal value for @xmath138 when bob moves along the same direction of z axis .",
    "this can be explained as follows . when @xmath139 , the polar angles @xmath140 for different momenta satisfy @xmath141 .",
    "@xmath140 drops as @xmath81 decreases and this helps to diminish @xmath138 .",
    "and @xmath140 goes up as @xmath81 increases , and this will enlarge the minimum error probability @xmath138 before @xmath140 exceeds @xmath142 . with @xmath81 large enough , @xmath140 will exceed @xmath142 , this will lead to an opposite effect that helps to diminish @xmath138 again .",
    "thus , we can define a `` critical point '' for the velocity @xmath81 , where the minimum error probability gets the maximal value . and",
    "the `` critical point '' for @xmath81 vs @xmath136 is shown in fig .",
    "the `` critical point '' decreases as @xmath136 goes up .",
    "distinguishing quantum states is like gaining information .",
    "alice has a classic information source encoded in quantum states @xmath143 , sent to bob with probabilities \\{@xmath144 } , and bob tries to determinate the states to obtain the information .",
    "the higher the successful probability is , the more information bob gets .",
    "a good measure of how much information bob can obtain is the accessible information .",
    "the upper bound of accessible information called holevo bound , is defined as follows @xcite , @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 is the von neumann entropy for @xmath148 .",
    "since the von neumann entropy for photon polarization is not a relativistic scalar , which is similar to that for massive particles @xcite , the holevo bound is not invariant in different frames .",
    "this is the reason why the discrimination between photon polarization is influenced by detector motion .",
    "we compare the holevo bound and photon polarization discrimination in the following .    for the unambiguous discrimination between @xmath149 and @xmath150 above , it is easy to obtain the holevo bounds in moving frames .",
    "simple calculation yields @xmath151 where @xmath152 corresponds to the relative velocity @xmath81 .",
    "the holevo bound @xmath153 and the successful probability @xmath154 are shown in fig .",
    "both @xmath153 and @xmath155 increase as @xmath152 goes up .    for the minimum - error discrimination between @xmath115 and @xmath116 that we mentioned earlier",
    ", the holevo bound can be numerically given according to eqs .",
    "( [ reduced ] ) and ( [ hb ] ) .",
    "the holevo bound @xmath156 and optimal correct possibility @xmath157 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , for @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "when bob moves along the opposite direction of z axis , @xmath158 , both @xmath156 and @xmath157 simultaneously increase as @xmath81 decreases .",
    "when bob move along the same direction of z axis , @xmath156 and @xmath157 decrease as the magnitude of @xmath81 increases , and both reach the minimum values at the `` critical point '' of @xmath81 .",
    "after the velocity @xmath81 exceeds the `` critical point '' , @xmath156 and @xmath157 increase again with @xmath81 rising .",
    "the two examples above reveal that , both the holevo bound and the optimal successful ( or correct ) probability simultaneously decrease or increase as @xmath81 changes .",
    "the discrimination between photon polarizations is influenced by the measurement apparatus velocity .",
    "in summary , we investigate the influence of detector velocity on discrimination between photon polarizations .",
    "the successful ( correct ) probability for unambiguous ( minimum - error discrimination ) is dependent on the apparatus velocity @xmath81 relative to the emitter .",
    "for some cases , there are `` critical points '' for the apparatus velocity at which the correct probabilities to distinguish the polarozations reach the maximal values .",
