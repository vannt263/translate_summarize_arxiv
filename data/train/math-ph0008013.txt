    "energy spectra characterized by the presence of bands and gaps are familiar from the bloch theory of periodic systems . in this note",
    ", we present another mechanism for the creation of spectral gaps which does not rely on translation invariance .",
    "the band - gap spectral structure plays an important role in the theory of the solid state  @xcite , as well as in the properties of dialectric and acustic media  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are also situations in which localized states are injected into existing gaps ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a mathematical discussion with further references ) .",
    "these applied models are mentioned only as distant analogies ; the topic we discuss pertains to spectral properties of hamiltonians of discrete models , whose `` hopping terms '' can be viewed as associated with graphs exhibiting a repeated local structure and a certain bottleneck in hopping amplitudes .",
    "to present the principle described herein it is convenient to introduce the notion of `` graph decoration '' .",
    "given two graphs @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we may `` decorate '' @xmath0 with @xmath1 by `` gluing '' a copy of @xmath1 to each vertex @xmath2 of @xmath0 in such a way that @xmath2 is identified with the appropriate copy of some distinguished vertex @xmath3 ( see  [ sec : decoration ] for a formal definition , and figures [ fig : example1 ] and [ fig : example2 ] for typical examples ) .",
    "given self - adjoint operators @xmath4 on @xmath5 and @xmath6 on @xmath7 there is a natural way to define an operator extension @xmath8 of @xmath4 and @xmath6 to @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the decorated graph just described . in the absence of certain degeneracy , there is a simple relation between the spectra of @xmath8 and @xmath4 , denoted here by @xmath11 , which allows us to conclude that intervals around certain energies @xmath12 are excluded from the spectrum of @xmath8 .",
    "specifically , there is a function @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and @xmath13 is of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see figure [ fig : typicalgamma ] ) .",
    "in fact , we shall see that @xmath12 are exactly the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the projection onto the subspace of functions in @xmath20 which vanish at @xmath21 .",
    "thus , we have the appealing picture in which the eigenenergies of the decorated graph are repelled by resonances with the `` inner spectrum '' of the decoration .    in  [ sec : decoration ] we define graph decoration and describe the operator extension mentioned above . in  [ sec : evaluation ] we present our main result ( prop .",
    "[ prop : main ] ) which describes the spectral relationship presented above in full detail . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : examples ] we provide several examples and applications of prop .",
    "[ prop : main ] .",
    "in this section , we suppose that we are given a graph @xmath0 and a self adjoint operator @xmath4 on @xmath5 , the space of square summable functions on the vertices of @xmath0 ( see below ) .",
    "our goal is to describe a certain class of graph extensions of @xmath0 and a corresponding class of operator extensions of @xmath4 .",
    "recall that a graph @xmath1 is described by specifying two sets : ( 1 ) @xmath22 whose elements are called vertices , and ( 2 ) @xmath23 a set of ( unordered ) pairs of vertices called edges .",
    "the edges play a secondary role in our discussion , for we are mainly concerned with the hilbert space of square summable functions mapping @xmath24 , which we denote @xmath5 .",
    "the situation of interest is when @xmath23 is defined so that a given operator @xmath6 on @xmath7 is _ compatible _ with @xmath1 , by which we mean that the off diagonal matrix elements @xmath25 vanish whenever @xmath26 .",
    ", with @xmath27 the kronecker function .",
    "] correspondingly , our notation generally identifies a graph @xmath1 with its vertex set : by @xmath28 we indicate @xmath29 and we shall say that a graph is countable ( finite ) if @xmath22 is countable ( finite ) .",
    "the graph extensions of @xmath0 shall be obtained by `` gluing '' copies of a second graph @xmath1 to each vertex of @xmath0 .",
    "the extended graph may be visualized as a field in which are tethered many identical kites ( see figures [ fig : example1 ] and [ fig : example2 ] ) . formally given any graph @xmath1 with a distinguished vertex @xmath30",
    "we define the _ decoration of   @xmath0 by @xmath31 _",

    "we denote by @xmath40 the orthogonal projection onto this space .",

    "a natural extension of @xmath41 to @xmath36 , incorporating @xmath6 , is @xmath42 the above operator is appropriate to the geometry of graph decoration , for if @xmath4 and @xmath6 are compatible with @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , then @xmath8 is compatible with @xmath43 .",

    "hence , the partial fraction expansion ( alternatively , the represenation theory of herglotz functions ) shows that @xmath13 is of the form displayed in eq . :",
    "@xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath16 .",

    "finally , the spectral inclusion @xmath105 follows since @xmath106 which may be verified using . if @xmath107 is a cyclic family for @xmath8 then eq",

    "in case @xmath109 is a cyclic vector for @xmath6 , this family is easily seen to be cyclic for @xmath8 .",

    "the relationship between the spectrum of @xmath4 and @xmath8 is a stronger relationship than the simple inclusion @xmath113 : _ the spectral type is preserved under the map @xmath114_.",
    "so , a bound state for @xmath4 gives rise to @xmath115 bound states for @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , a band of absolutely continuous spectrum for @xmath4 gives rise to @xmath115 bands of absolutely continuous spectrum for @xmath8 .",

    "however , even when @xmath116 is not cyclic , we may still determine the spectrum of @xmath8 .",
