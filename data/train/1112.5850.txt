    "an arbitrage operation involves buying some good or asset for a lower price than that for which it can be sold , taking advantage of any imbalance in the quoted prices .",
    "the `` law of one price '' is a statement of a key implication of the absence of arbitrage opportunities . in turn arbitrage",
    "is often the process invoked to explain why goods or assets that are in some sense `` identical '' should have a common price .    a study of commodity prices since 1273 concluded that ``  despite the steady decline in transportation costs over the past 700 years , the repeated intrusion of wars and disease , and the changing fashions of commercial policy",
    ", the volatility and persistence of deviations in the law of one price have remained quite stable '' @xcite .",
    "the present paper investigates a relatively neglected complication regarding arbitrage operations , namely the order in which information about arbitrage opportunities is presented , illustrating this in relation to arbitrage chains involving four currencies .",
    "the key finding is that arbitrage operations can be periodic in nature , rather than involving a smooth convergence to a law of one price .",
    "the early literature on the law of one price is coeval with the purchasing power parity explanation of foreign exchange rates .",
    "the terminology was coined in @xcite , involving arbitrage between relatively homogeneous goods priced in different currencies @xcite .",
    "empirical tests suggest that arbitrage operations in goods do not exert a strong influence on exchange rates until the price index deviations involved exceed about 25% @xcite .",
    "innovations that were expected to reduce price dispersion , such as the european single market legislation coming into effect in 1992 , and the economic and monetary union project beginning in 1999 , have had little effect on price level disparities @xcite .",
    "the degree of price level dispersion between us cities has displayed no marked trend over time @xcite .",
    "a study of the prices charged for identical products in ikea stores in twenty - five countries revealed typical price divergences of 2050% , differences that could not be attributed to just country or location - specific factors @xcite . among the most cited reasons for deviations from the law of one price",
    "are transaction costs , taxes , transport costs , trade barriers , the costs of searching for price differences , nominal price rigidities , customer market pricing , nominal exchange rate rigidities and differences in market power @xcite .    in relation to assets , an early application of the law of one price was to the interest rate parity theory of the forward exchange rate , whereby the ratio of the forward to spot exchange rate between two currencies is equal to the ratio of the interest rates in the two currencies over the forward period in question @xcite . an arbitrage opportunity in relation to assets can be defined as `` an investment strategy that guarantees a positive payoff in some contingency with no possibility of a negative payoff and with no net investment '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* online ) .",
    "the absence of such arbitrage opportunities has been seen as the unifying concept underlying mainstream theories in finance , no - arbitrage principles being applied in the modigliani ",
    "miller theorem of corporate capital structure , in the black ",
    "scholes model of option pricing and in the arbitrage pricing model of asset prices @xcite .",
    "actual arbitrage operations in relation to assets often involve net investment and risk and/or uncertainty , in addition to the complications arising in relation to arbitrage in goods .",
    "notable deviations from the law of one price in financial markets have been documented in relation to comparable circumstances applying to closed - end country funds , american depository receipts , twin shares , dual share classes and corporate spin - offs @xcite . among the limits to arbitrage in financial markets",
    "are those arising from transactions costs @xcite , and those involving the capital requirements of conducting arbitrage operations @xcite .",
    "a spectacular illustration of the capital limits to arbitrage was provided by the demise of the long - term capital management ( ltcm ) hedge funds .",
    "the arbitrage discrepancies being exploited in ltcm s `` convergence trades '' widened in 1998 .",
    "ltcm attempted unsuccessfully to raise new capital to finance its arbitrage positions . to avoid a major financial collapse the new york federal reserve board organised a bail - out by creditors @xcite .    in what follows we focus on the limits to arbitrage arising from the order in which information is disseminated to arbitrage traders .",
    "the illustration used is for a foreign exchange ( fx ) market with four fx traders and four currencies , see sections  [ s-3currencies ] and [ s-4currencies ] .",
    "an arbiter , the metaphorical equivalent of an unpaid auctioneer in a walrasian system , knows all the actual exchange rates .",
    "the individual fx traders , however , initially know only the exchange rates involving their own , domestic currencies .",
    "justification for the assumptions used in our model is provided in section  [ s - structfx ] .",
    "so the us fx trader knows the exchange rates for the dollar against the euro , sterling and yen , but not the cross exchange rates for the non - dollar currencies .",
    "there are no transactions costs , no net capital requirements and no risks involved in the arbitrage operations .",
    "instead we focus on the information dissemination problem , and show that the order in which information about cross exchange rate discrepancies , and hence arbitrage opportunities , is presented makes an important difference to the sequences of arbitrage operations conducted .    a general discussion of arbitrage dynamics is given in section  [ s - arbitrages ] .",
    "an unexpected feature of the processes considered in this paper is that , _ rather than there being a smooth convergence to an ensemble of exchange rates with no arbitrage opportunities , the arbitrage operations may display periodicity and no necessary convergence on a cross exchange rate law of one price_. see proposition  [ 32 ] in section  [ mrss ] for a rigorous explanation .",
    "a further unexpected feature is that , _ starting at an ensemble of exchange rates which is not balanced , and using special periodic sequences of arbitrages , the arbiter can achieve balanced ( satisfying the law of one price ) exchange rate ensemble_. see , in particular , theorem  [ arbh ] in section  [ mrss ] and theorem  [ irratbc ] in section  [ s - gencase ] .",
    "these counter - intuitive results are new , as far as we are aware . in line with the renowned `` impossibility theorem '' of @xcite",
    "these results suggest an `` arbitrage impossibility theorem '' .",
    "proofs are relegated to section  [ s - proofs ] .",
    "the mathematical approach taken in this paper to the analysis of arbitrage operation chains may be understood as a typical example of the asynchronous interactions that are important in systems theory and in control theory , see the monographs @xcite and the surveys @xcite .",
    "the arbitrage chains are particularly relevant to desynchronised systems theory , see @xcite .",
    "presence of an asynchronous interaction often leads to a dramatic complication of the related mathematical problems .",
    "@xcite proved that many asynchronous problems can not be solved algorithmically , and also @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that , even in the cases when the problem is algorithmically solvable , it is typically as hard to solve numerically as the famous `` travelling salesman problem , '' see @xcite ( that is , in the mathematical language , the problem is np - hard which is an abbreviation for `` non - deterministic polynomial - time hard '' which means in the theory of algorithms that a problem is very hard , if possible , to solve , see @xcite ) . in this context the fact that the principal questions that arise in analysis of arbitrage operation chains admit straightforward combinatorial analysis came to the authors as a pleasant surprise .",
    "our construction uses a geometrical approach to visualisation of arbitrage chains presented in sections  [ simpleass][s - proofs ] , which may be useful in relation to other problems in mathematical economics .",
    "the periodicity results in this paper have implications for several strands of literature .",
    "one is that dealing with the disequilibrium foundations of equilibrium economics .",
    "the stability analysis of fisher poses the question : `` can one expect to prove that an economy with rational agents conscious of disequilibrium and taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities is driven ( asymptotically ) to any equilibrium , walrasian or constrained ? ''",
    "fisher uses the assumption of `` no favorable surprise '' as a means of demonstrating that a cessation of exogenous shocks can lead to convergence to equilibrium .",
    "the results in this paper suggest that there can be endogenous reasons , arising from the cyclical response of arbitrage sequences to an exogenous shock that gives rise to an arbitrage opportunity , why convergence to equilibrium may not take place .",
    "another strand of literature to which our results relate is that on market segmentation and arbitrage networks .",
    "goods and assets are not traded on a single exchange . instead there are various trading posts , such as commodity and stock exchanges .",
    "other trades , including a sizeable proportion of foreign exchange deals , are conducted `` over the counter '' in direct transactions that bypass formal exchanges .",
    "`` as a result , various clienteles trade on different exchanges , and very few retail clients trade on more than one exchange , let alone on all of them simultaneously '' @xcite .",
    "a key aspect of segmentation in the foreign exchange `` market '' is that dealing rooms tend to specialise in domestic currency trades .",
    "this provides a rationale for the specification in this paper that foreign exchange dealers initially are aware of only the exchange rates involving their domestic currencies .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the case of 4 currencies , with 6 principal exchange rates .",
    "the financial times gives daily quotes for 52 currencies .",
    "the 1,326 principal exchange rates involved suggest richer potential opportunities for arbitrage than in the four currency case studied in the present paper .",
    "bank for international settlements ( bis ) data indicate that , in 2010 , transactions in these four currencies counted for 155.9% of global fx market turnover , the currency components being us dollars ( 84.9% ) , euros ( 39.1% ) , japanese yen ( 19.0% ) and pound sterling ( 12.9% ) . because two currencies are involved in each transaction , the % shares sum to 200% ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  b.4 ) .",
    "in a centralised market trade takes place at prices that are public information and traders face the same potential trading opportunities .",
    "in contrast the fx market is decentralised , with the end - user bank customers , banks , brokers and central banks involved facing several possible methods of executing transactions , and possibly different exchange rate quotes , some of which constitute private information .",
    "bis data for fx spot exchange rate transactions in 2010 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  e.24 ) indicate the following breakdown in execution methods as a % of total global turnover : inter - dealer direct ( 14.9% ) , customer direct ( 21.6% ) , voice broker ( 8.6% ) , electronic broking system ( 26.0% ) , single - bank electronic proprietary trading platforms ( 14.3% ) and multi - bank dealing systems ( 14.5% ) . until the late 1980s fx transactions were conducted largely by telephone , with fx dealers phoning counterparties to get bid (",
    "buy ) and offer ( sell ) quotes for specific transaction amounts , there also being indirect dealing via voice brokers who would search for matching interests between clients , see @xcite .",
    "the last two decades have seen a growth in electronic methods of execution , a distinction being between electronic broking systems such as reuters matching and the electronic broking system spot dealing system ( ebs ) , and single or multi - bank proprietary dealing platforms .",
    "a burgeoning literature investigates how this fragmented trading structure impacts on price determination in fx markets , see @xcite and @xcite for surveys .",
    "the key contrast is between the decentralised transactions conducted by fx dealers who quote bid and offer prices that are not public information , and the one - way bid or offer limit orders to buy and sell currencies at a specific price that are accumulated by fx brokers in the quasi - centralised segment of the market .",
    "this means that market information is fragmented , fx dealers having private information about the transactions forthcoming at their own quoted bid and offer prices , and having access to the public information regarding the order flows accumulated by the fx brokers . for analysis , discussion and evidence regarding",
    "how order flows impact on intra - day exchange rates see @xcite .",
    "the analysis in the present paper assumes that fx dealers initially know only the exchange rates for their own domestic currencies , the order in which they discover imbalances in the exchange rate ensemble , in the form of cross exchange rate discrepancies , playing a key role in the arbitrage sequences conducted .",
    "the fragmented nature of information in fx markets suggests that this strong assumption has a whiff of reality in that different fx dealers are likely to have disjoint information sets and can conduct trades at different prices .",
    "individual fx dealers conducting bi - lateral trades with end - users receive private information in the form of the orders forthcoming at their quoted bid and ask prices , and this can give rise to profitable arbitrage opportunities .",
    "for example , an fx dealer specialising in us dollars might simultaneously receive large buy orders for euros and large sell orders for japanese yen , and suspect that euros are under - priced relative to japanese yen .",
    "after checking out the euro ",
    "japanese yen exchange rates quoted in the inter - dealer market , or in the brokered section of the market where information is public , the dealer might discover that this is indeed the case , and exploit this arbitrage opportunity regarding which other fx traders are initially unaware .",
    "the bis data on the geographical distribution of fx market turnover is informative in relation to the assumption in the present paper that fx dealers initially are aware of only the exchange rates involving their own domestic currency .",
    "banks located in the uk account for 37% of global fx turnover , followed by the us ( 18% ) , japan ( 6% ) , singapore ( 5% ) , switzerland ( 5% ) , hong kong ( 5% ) and australia ( 4% )  see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* graph  b.7 ) .",
    "although cross - border transactions account for nearly two - thirds of fx market turnover , this still leaves 35% of the turnover being local in nature ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  3.2 ) , suggesting that the tendency of fx dealers initially to focus on the exchange rates involving their own domestic currencies assumed in the present paper is evident in a significant section of the fx market .",
    "traders could be better informed about exchange rate developments involving their own domestic currencies for a variety of reasons .",
    "this could be simply because their core end - users have the domestic currency as a unit of account , and means of payment , so the domestically - based fx dealers have a `` home bias '' when it comes to the exchange rates that they consider first .",
    "the psychology literature indicates that here are quite tight limits to the pieces of information that the working memory can take into account when decisions are made @xcite , suggesting that there could well be advantages to fx traders if they focus , at least initially , on a limited number of exchange rates . alternatively",
    "the `` home bias '' could be due to the existence of different time zones .",
    "so , for example , japanese fx traders may be more able to react to new information relevant to the japanese yen during the asian trading hours in which north american and european markets are closed .",
    "the evidence is that most fx trades initiated in japan and australia occur during asian trading hours ; most trades initiated in the us and canada occur during north american hours ; while uk - initiated trades tend to be bunched in the overlapping asia  europe and europe  north america time zones ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  2 ) .",
    "a further reason for `` home bias '' is that the localised or institutionalised links that fx traders have with domestic clients gives them order flow information about the likely course of the exchange rates involving the domestic currency before the price impact of this information becomes publicly available , via the effects on inter - dealer trades , to fx traders operating in foreign locations .",
    "in @xcite the authors pose the question `` does tokyo know more about the yen ? '' . prior to december 22 , 1994",
    "the japanese fx market closed for lunch from 1200 to 1330 hours , tokyo time .",
    "on the basis that local order flow conveys informational advantages , the authors postulate that the trades of informed tokyo traders would be bunched before the lunch - time fx market closure , an effect that would disappear once the lunch - time closure was abolished .",
    "they found a significant tendency of foreign quotes on the japanese yen  us dollar market to lag behind the tokyo quotes in this pre - lunch period , suggesting either that tokyo - based traders were better informed about the japanese yen  us dollar exchange rate than fx traders based in foreign locations , or that foreign - based traders believed this to be the case .",
    "further evidence for a `` home bias '' in the fx market was found in a study of the canadian dollar  us dollar and australian dollar  us dollar markets @xcite .",
    "the author calculates the impulse response functions of the exchange rates to trades , measured by the order flows , initiated in different locations .",
    "trades initiated in canada had a larger long - run impact on the canadian dollar  us dollar exchange rate than those initiated the us during north american trading hours , and than australian and japanese trades initiated during asian trading hours .",
    "uk - initiated trades had a slightly larger long - run effect during european trading hours , but this effect was much larger before the start of north american trading hours .",
    "somewhat similarly , trades initiated in australia had a larger long - run impact on australian dollar  us dollar exchange rate than trades initiated in the us and elsewhere .",
    "the conclusion is that `` dealers operating both at the same time and in the same geographic region as fundamentally driven customers have a natural informational advantage '' @xcite .    a major challenge to theories based on the idea that macroeconomic `` fundamentals '' drive exchange rates was presented by the meese - rogoff results that such models did not forecast any better than the `` naive '' postulate that the exchange rate rate would remain unchanged @xcite .",
    "engel and west @xcite showed that exchange rates would display something close to the random walk implied by the naive forecast if the fundamentals followed an @xmath0 process and the factor for discounting future fundamentals was close to one .",
    "the microstructure literature has shown a way out of this impasse , showing that micro - based information regarding order flows , information which is not necessarily publicly available , can explain a significant component of exchange rate variation .",
    "so , for example , evans and lyons @xcite show that end - user order flow data can explain around 16% of the variance in the monthly spot rate between the us dollar and the euro , outperforming both standard macro fundamentals models and the random walk specification .",
    "the microstructure literature has also focussed attention onto high frequency data sets .",
    "osler @xcite , for example , analyses minute - by - minute quotes for the us dollar spot exchange rates with the deutschmark , japanese yen and pound sterling , discovering significant effects from stop - loss order flows , where the stop - loss order is one that instructs fx dealers to buy ( sell ) a certain amount of a currency at the `` market '' rate once the exchange rate has risen ( fallen ) to a pre - specified level .    a full survey of the theoretical and empirical literature on fx exchange rate determination has been beyond the scope of the present paper ( see @xcite for such a survey ) .",
    "what we would argue is that the foregoing selective review of the literature provides some justification for the assumptions used in the analysis of the arbitrage sequences that follows .",
    "the assumption that fx dealers initially know only the exchange rates for their domestic currency finds some support in the `` home bias '' evidence cited above .",
    "the evidence on the fragmented nature of the fx market lends support to the assumption that fx traders can have privileged access to initially private information , stemming from order flows from end - user clients , that would allow them to identify imbalances in cross exchange rates , and hence identify arbitrage opportunities before fx traders based in other locations can identify such opportunities .",
    "there is also evidence that there are arbitrage opportunities to be exploited . in @xcite",
    "the authors use binding quote and transactions data from the electronic broking system , ebs , for the us dollar , euros , japanese yen , the pound sterling and the swiss franc .",
    "triangular arbitrage opportunities are identified within two - minute time horizons , and can be exploited by three trades on the ebs trading screen .",
    "each identified arbitrage opportunity involved the us dollar and the euro , the third currency being the japanese yen , pound sterling or swiss franc .",
    "the estimated mean arbitrage profits , net of bid - offer spreads and 0.2 basis point trade fees , ranged from 2.8 to 3.0 basis points @xcite .",
    "so here is evidence of , albeit small , profits to be had from arbitrage operations on a quasi - centralised , electronic broking trading platform .",
    "once the decentralised sections of the fx market are considered , the existence of initially private information is likely extend the range and size of profitable arbitrage arbitrage opportunities available .",
    "consider a foreign exchange ( fx ) market that involves only three currencies : dollars ( $ ) , euros (  ) and sterling (  ) .",
    "this fx market involves three pair - wise exchange operations : @xmath1 the currencies are measured in natural currency units , and the corresponding ( strictly positive ) exchange rates , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , are well defined .",
    "for instance , one dollar can be exchanged for @xmath2 euros .",
    "the rates related to the inverted arrows are reciprocal : @xmath5 we treat the triplet @xmath6 as the ensemble of _ principal exchange rates .",
    "_    we suppose that , prior to a reference time moment @xmath7 , each fx trader knows only the exchange rates involving his domestic currency .",
    "so the dollar trader does not know the value of @xmath8 , the euro trader is unaware of @xmath3 , and the sterling trader is unaware of @xmath9 .",
    "we are interested in the case where the initial rates are unbalanced in the following sense . by assumption",
    ", the dollar trader can exchange one dollar for @xmath9 euros .",
    "let us suppose that unbeknownst to him the exchange rate between sterling and euro is such that the the dollar trader could make a profit by first exchanging a dollar for @xmath3 units of sterling and then exchanging these for euros .",
    "the inequality which guarantees that dollar trader can take advantage of this arbitrage opportunity is that the product @xmath10 is greater than @xmath9 : @xmath11    let us consider the situation where the inequality holds , and , after the reference time moment @xmath7 , one of the three traders becomes aware of the third exchange rate .",
    "the evolution of this fx market depends on _ which trader is the first to discover the information concerning the third exchange rate_. the following three cases are relevant .",
    "the dollar trader becomes aware of the value of the rate @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the dollar trader contacts the euro trader and makes a request to increase the rate @xmath9 to the new fairer value @xmath12 the reciprocal exchange rate @xmath13 is also to be adjusted to the new level : @xmath14 the result is that the principal exchange rates become balanced at the levels : @xmath15      the euro trader is the first to discover the third exchange rate @xmath3 . by , inequality may be rewritten as @xmath16 which is , in turn , equivalent to @xmath17 . in this case",
    "the euro trader could do better by first exchanging euros for dollars , and then by exchanging the dollars for sterling .",
    "therefore , the euro trader requests adjustment of the rate @xmath8 to the value @xmath18 in terms of the principal exchange rates the outcome is that the fx market adjusts to the following balanced rates : @xmath19      the sterling trader is the first to discover the third exchange rate @xmath9 .",
    "the inequality may be rewritten as @xmath20 thus , the sterling trader requests adjustment of the rate @xmath21 to @xmath22 . in this case",
    "the principal exchange rates become balanced at the levels : @xmath23    _ after the adjustment of the principal exchange rates , following the new information being revealed , the exchange rates become balanced , and this is the end of the arbitrage evolution of an fx market with three currencies .",
    "having established the reasonably straightforward application of arbitrage to three currencies , we now turn to investigation what happens when the fx market contains four currencies and four currency traders . _",
    "consider an fx market $  that involves four currencies : dollars ( $ ) , euros ( ) , sterling (  ) and yen ( ) .",
    "this fx market involves six exchange relationships : @xmath24 the exchange rates are : @xmath25 the rates relating to the inverted arrows are reciprocal : @xmath26 our market may be described by the ensemble of six principal exchange rates @xmath27 together with the reciprocal exchange rates .",
    "the following characterisation of balanced , no - arbitrage , exchange rates , that is the ensembles of exchange rates such that no trader could do better by trading indirectly , is convenient .",
    "[ balp ] ensemble of the principal exchange rates is balanced if and only if the following relationships hold : @xmath28    this assertion can be proved by inspection .",
    "let us suppose that initially each trader is aware only of the three exchange rates involving his domestic currency . for instance , the dollar trader knows only the rates @xmath9 , @xmath3 , @xmath29 .",
    "_ we are interested in the case where the rates @xmath9 , @xmath3 , @xmath29 , @xmath8 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are unbalanced_.    for instance , let us suppose that can make a profit by first exchanging one dollar for @xmath3 units of sterling , and then by exchanging this sterling for euros .",
    "this means that the product @xmath32 is greater than @xmath9 : @xmath33 suppose that becomes aware of the rate @xmath8 , and , therefore , about the inequality .",
    "the dollar trader then asks to increase the exchange rate @xmath9 to the new fairer value @xmath34 along with the adjustment of the exchange rate @xmath9 the reciprocal rate @xmath13 would be adjusted to @xmath35 we call this procedure $  -_arbitrage _ , and we use the notation @xmath36 to represent it .",

    "the model is illustrated with regard to a foreign exchange market with four currencies and traders , so there are @xmath487 principal exchange rates . despite abstracting from various complications  such as transaction costs , capital requirements and risk  that are often invoked to explain the limits to arbitrage , we find that the arbitrage operations conducted by the fx traders can generate periodicity or more complicated behaviour in the ensemble of exchange rates , rather than smooth convergence to a `` balanced '' ensemble where the law of one price holds",
    ".    we use the fiction of an arbiter , who knows all the actual exchange rates and what a balanced ensemble would be , to bring out the information problem .",
    "fx traders tend to specialise in particular currencies , so the assumption that the fx traders are initially aware only of the exchange rates for their own `` domestic '' currencies is not entirely implausible .",
    "we show that the order in which the arbiter reveals information to individual traders regarding discrepancies in exchange rate ensembles makes a key difference to the arbitrage sequences that will be pursued .",
    "the sequences are periodic in nature , and show no clear signs of convergence on a balanced ensemble of exchange rates .",
    "the arbiter might know the law of one price exchange rate ensemble , but the traders have little chance of stumbling onto such an ensemble by way of their arbitrage operations .",
    "the analysis in the present paper raises several issues to pursue in future research .",
    "an obvious extension is to allow for a larger number of currencies and ask what happens to the arbitrage sequences as this number becomes large",
    ". one interesting modification of the analysis would allow the fx traders to learn that arbitrage sequences tend to be periodic and modify their arbitrage strategies to take the periodicity into account .",
    "another modification would allow some arbitrage operations to be pursued simultaneously , and ask what happens as the limiting case where all arbitrage operations are exploited simultaneously is approached .",
    "an alternative reformulation of the analysis would be as a markov process where the states are sextuples of exchange rates between the four currencies and the passages between the states reflect the effects of arbitrage operations pursued",
    ". it would be interesting to see if this could be done without compromising the relative simplicity of the present formulation . finally , but by no means",
    "exhaustively , it would be interesting to work with high frequency data sets to test for the existence of the types of arbitrage sequences postulated in the present paper .",
