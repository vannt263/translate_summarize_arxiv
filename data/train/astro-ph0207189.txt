    "what is the universe made of",
    "? how did the universe begin ?",
    "how will it end ?",
    "these are some of the fundamental questions which can be addressed by studying the large scale distribution of galaxies in the universe .",
    "it is widely believed that the galaxies we see today formed at the sites of tiny ( @xmath1 1 part in @xmath2 ) density fluctuations in the early universe .",
    "the form of these density fluctuations ( which , if gaussian in nature , may be fully described by their power spectrum ) are predicted by cosmological models , and depend on such parameters as the mean matter density @xmath3 , the fraction of baryonic matter @xmath4 and any contribution to the cosmological density from vacuum energy , also known as the cosmological constant @xmath5 . on large scales ,",
    "the clustering of galaxies can be predicted from the primordial density fluctuations using linear perturbation theory . by measuring this large - scale clustering ,",
    "we can thus obtain important constraints on cosmological models . by studying the intrinsic properties of the galaxies themselves , such as luminosity , colour and morphology , we can test theories for how galaxies are born and evolve .    in order to measure the clustering of galaxies reliably , it is important to use a systematic and well - defined catalogue .",
    "systematic surveys date back to that of messier , published in three parts in the 1770s and 1780s , although it was not realized at the time that some of the nebulae catalogued by messier were other galaxies outside our own milky way .",
    "it was only in 1923 , by a careful measurement of the distance to the andromeda nebula ( m31 in messier s catalogue ) , that edwin hubble proved definitively that m31 was a large galaxy separate from our own .",
    "hubble later discovered the expansion of the universe , and found that the recession velocity of a galaxy is in direct proportion to its distance from us , the hubble law .",
    "since then , a number of galaxy surveys have been published , starting with that of shapley and ames in 1932 @xcite , and including more recently the apm galaxy survey @xcite , which contains positions and magnitudes for about three million galaxies .",
    "most of these surveys are based on photographic plates , and there is concern that such surveys could be missing a substantial fraction of low surface - brightness galaxies , eg .",
    "there is also apprehension that uncertainties in the photometric calibration of these surveys could lead to spurious measurement of galaxy clustering on large scales @xcite .",
    "smaller surveys have been made using charge coupled device ( ccd ) detectors .",
    "these solid state devices , unlike photographic plates , have a linear response to light and @xmath6 times higher quantum efficiency , but the limited size of these detectors has before now precluded the construction of wide - area galaxy surveys .    in order to map out the three - dimensional distribution of galaxies , as opposed to just their two - dimensional projection on the celestial sphere",
    ", one needs the distance to each galaxy .",
    "this may be obtained by measuring the spectrum of light emitted by a galaxy . the doppler shift in features towards the red end of the spectrum ( the redshift )",
    "may be used to infer a galaxy s recession velocity and hence its distance from the hubble relation . until recently ,",
    "galaxy spectra were painstakingly measured one - by - one , and it is only in the last few years that optical fibre multiplexing has been used to measure redshifts for many thousands of galaxies .",
    "the largest redshift survey to date is the nearly - completed two degree field ( 2df ) galaxy redshift survey carried out on the anglo - australian telescope @xcite . while containing redshifts for more than 200,000 galaxies , the 2df survey is based on the photographic apm galaxy survey , with the potential problems mentioned above .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) collaboration was therefore formed in 1988 with the aim of constructing a definitive map of the local universe , incorporating ccd imaging in several passbands over a large area of sky , and measurement of redshifts for around one million galaxies . in order to complete such an ambitious project over a reasonable timescale ,",
    "it was decided to build a dedicated 2.5-metre telescope equipped with a large ccd array imaging camera and multi - fibre spectrographs .",
    "the survey itself began in april 2000 , and observations are scheduled to finish in june 2005 . in this article i review some important aspects of the survey , including an overview of survey operations (  [ sec : overview ] ) , a description of the preliminary public data release (  [ sec : edr ] ) , and a selection of some early science results (  [ sec : science ] ) .",
    "the basic goal of the survey is to make a definitive map of the local universe , which can then be used to constrain cosmological models and models for the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "this map will consist of 5-colour imaging to a @xmath7-band limiting magnitude @xmath8 over a contiguous area of @xmath9 steradians ( 10,000 square degrees ) in the northern sky and three , non - contiguous stripes with total area 740 square degrees in the southern sky .",
    "( magnitudes measure flux on a logarithmic scale , where smaller magnitudes correspond to larger flux .",
    "the magnitude difference between two stars of flux @xmath10 and @xmath11 is defined to be @xmath12 .",
    "the brightest stars have magnitude @xmath13 , the faintest stars visible to the naked eye have @xmath14 , ie .",
    "100 times fainter .",
    "a magnitude @xmath8 thus corresponds to an observed flux which is roughly six million times fainter than that of the dimmest naked - eye stars . ) from this imaging data we can map out the two - dimensional distribution of galaxies and quasars as projected on the celestial sphere .",
    "distances to a subset of these objects will be determined by observing spectra of roughly one million galaxies and 100,000 quasars .",
    "the spectrum of a galaxy or quasar enables one to measure its recession velocity @xmath15 from the doppler redshift of spectral features .",
    "distances @xmath16 may then be estimated from the hubble law : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 km / s / mpc is the _",
    "hubble parameter_. in this way , we can map out the three - dimensional distribution of objects in space .",
    "( astronomers often measure extragalactic distances in units of mpc where 1 mpc = @xmath19 parsecs , and 1 parsec @xmath20 m .",
    "uncertainty in the value of @xmath21 leads to a corresponding uncertainty in distances derived from the hubble relation . to reflect this ,",
    "distances are often written in units of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 km / s / mpc . )",
    "the sdss consists of two concurrent surveys , one photometric and one spectroscopic . to complete a digital survey over a large fraction of the sky within a reasonable timescale ,",
    "it is necessary to conduct wide - field imaging and multi - object spectroscopy . to meet this need , a wide - field telescope ,",
    "imaging camera and multi - fibre spectrographs were designed and built specifically for this purpose , which i describe very briefly below .",
    "the survey hardware comprises the 2.5-metre survey telescope , a 0.5-metre photometric telescope ( called the monitor telescope in its previous incarnation ) , a state - of - the - art imaging camera @xcite that observes near - simultaneously in five passbands covering the near - ultraviolet to near - infrared , and a pair of dual beam spectrographs , each capable of observing 320 fibre - fed spectra .",
    "the site is also equipped with a 10-micron all - sky camera @xcite , which provides rapid warning of any cloud cover .",
    "the data are reduced by a series of automated pipelines and the resulting data products stored in an object - oriented database .",
    "the main survey telescope is of modified ritchey - chrtien design @xcite , with a primary aperture of 2.5 m and a focal ratio of f/5 to produce a flat field of 3  with a plate scale of 16.51 arcsec / mm .",
    "it is situated at apache point observatory , near sunspot , new mexico , at a height of 2,800 m .",
    "the telescope is housed in an enclosure which rolls off for observing , and is encased in a co - rotating baffle which protects it from wind disturbances and stray light .",
    "this unique design allows the telescope to remain free of dome - induced seeing .",
    "photographs of the site and telescope can be found at http://www.sdss.org/. a technical overview of the survey has been given by york et al . @xcite and further details are available online in the _ sdss project book _ at http://astro.princeton.edu/pbook/welcome.htm .",
    "the photometric imaging survey will produce a database of roughly 10@xmath24 galaxies and 10@xmath24 stellar objects , with accurate ( @xmath25 0.10 arcsec ) astrometry , 5-colour photometry , and object classification parameters .",
    "this database will become a public archive .",
    "imaging ccds are colour - coded blue , green , red , black and orange respectively .",
    "the astrometric ccds are shown as narrow red rectangles .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction of motion of astronomical sources across the imaging array , which subtends 2.3  on the sky . ]",
    "the imaging camera @xcite ( figure  [ fig : camera ] ) consists of 54 ccds in eight dewars and spans @xmath26 on the sky .",
    "thirty of these ccds are the main imaging / photometric devices , each a site ( scientific imaging technologies , formerly tektronix ) device with @xmath27 pixels .",
    "they are arranged in six dewars aligned with the scan direction and holding 5 ccds each , one ccd for each filter bandpass .",
    "the camera operates in tdi ( time delay and integrate ) , or scanning , mode for which the telescope is driven at a rate synchronous with the charge transfer rate of the ccds .",
    "objects on the sky drift down the ccd array so that nearly simultaneous 5-colour photometry is obtained .",
    "the effective integration time , _ i.e. _ the time any part of the sky spends on each detector , is 55 seconds at the chosen ( sidereal ) scanning rate , which results in a limiting magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "the sdss photometric system @xmath28 @xcite ( figure  [ fig : filters ] ) has been specifically designed for this survey and covers the near - uv to near - ir range ( @xmath29@xmath30 ) in five essentially non - overlapping passbands .",
    "the @xmath31 filter response peaks in the near ultra - violet at 3500 , @xmath7 is a blue - green band centred at 4800 , @xmath32 is a red band centred at 6250 , @xmath33 is a far - red filter centred at 7700  and @xmath34 is a near - infrared passband centred at 9100 .",
    "the standard stars that define this system have been presented by smith et al.@xcite .",
    "the photometric data are not yet finally calibrated , so the current magnitudes are indicated with asterisks , @xmath35 , to denote their preliminary nature .",
    "the sdss filters themselves are referred to simply as @xmath36 , without primes or asterisks .    in order to provide photometric calibration while the imaging camera is scanning , a second , dedicated _ photometric telescope",
    "_ operates concurrently , observing photometric standard stars and creating photometrically calibrated `` secondary patches '' which lie within the main telescope s scan .",
    "these calibration patches are then used to transfer the primary photometric calibration to objects detected with the 2.5 m telescope and imaging camera .",
    "the photometric quality of the data is monitored by a software `` robot '' that automatically rejects data observed during cloudy periods @xcite .",
    "the other 24 ccds in two additional dewars are also site chips of width 2048 24@xmath37 pixels , but they have only 400 rows in the scanning direction . these dewars are oriented perpendicular to the photometric dewars , with one at the top and one at the bottom of the imaging array .",
    "two of these ccds ( one in each dewar ) are used to determine changes in focus .",
    "the remaining 22 ccds reach brighter magnitudes before saturating and are used to tie our observations to an astrometric reference frame defined by bright stars which saturate our imaging detectors @xcite .",
    "the location of the survey imaging area is shown in figure  [ fig : stripes ] .",
    "the northern survey area is centred near the north galactic pole and it lies within a nearly elliptical shape @xmath38 e - w by @xmath39 n - s chosen to minimize galactic foreground extinction .",
    "all scans are conducted along great circles in order to minimize the transit time differences across the camera array .",
    "there are 45 great circles ( `` stripes '' ) in the northern survey region separated by 2.5 .",
    "we observe three non - contiguous stripes in the southern galactic hemisphere , at declinations of 0 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , during parts of the autumn season when the northern sky is unobservable .",
    "each stripe is scanned twice , with an offset perpendicular to the scan direction in order to interlace the photometric columns .",
    "a completed stripe slightly exceeds @xmath42 in width and thus there is a small amount of overlap to allow for telescope mis - tracking and to provide multiple observations of some fraction of the sky for quality assurance purposes . the total stripe length for the 45 northern stripes will require a minimum of 650 hours of pristine photometric and seeing conditions to scan at a sidereal rate . based upon our current experience of observing conditions at apo",
    ", it seems likely that we will only complete about 75% of this imaging after 5 years of survey operations .",
    "the goals of the spectroscopic survey are to observe spectra for @xmath19 galaxies , @xmath2 quasars and @xmath2 stars .",
    "in order to obtain the spectra of over @xmath19 objects in a survey covering 10@xmath43 square degrees , we must obtain spectra of about 100 objects per square degree .",
    "although some overlap of fields is inevitable , we would like to keep this overlap to a minimum for reasons of efficiency and cost .",
    "hence , we need to obtain several hundred spectra per 3  diameter spectroscopic field .",
    "to accommodate this requirement , two identical multi - fibre spectrographs have been built which are each fed by 320 fibres .",
    "the spectrographs cover the wavelength range 39009100  at a resolution of @xmath44 1800 , or 167 km s@xmath45 .",
    "each spectrograph has two cameras , one optimized for the red and the other for the blue .",
    "each camera has as its detector a @xmath46 ccd with 24@xmath37 pixels .",
    "the 180@xmath37 fibres , which each subtend @xmath47 on the sky , are located in the focal plane by plugging them by hand into aluminium plates which are precisely drilled for each field based upon the astrometric solution obtained from the imaging data . to avoid mechanical interference ,",
    "individual fibres can be placed no closer than @xmath48 to one another .",
    "the plates and fibres are held in the focal plane , and coupled with the spectrographs , by one of 9 identical rigid assemblies called cartridges .",
    "since all of the cartridges can be pre - plugged during the day , 5,760 spectra can be obtained during a long night without re - plugging .",
    "a mapping procedure is invoked after plugging each cartridge that automatically tags each fibre to the appropriate object on the sky .",
    "a surface density of 100 galaxies per square degree corresponds roughly to an @xmath32-band magnitude limit @xmath49 . to obtain redshifts for galaxies of this magnitude requires exposure times of about 45 minutes , which we split into three , 15 minute exposures to aid in rejection of cosmic rays .",
    "cosmic ray events occur at essentially random locations on our detectors , and so are very unlikely to appear at the same place in all three exposures .",
    "each field takes about one hour , including calibration ( flat field and comparison lamp ) exposures and allowing for telescope pointing and the exchange of fibre cartridges .",
    "spectroscopic observations are carried out whenever observing conditions are not adequate for imaging , ie . when seeing exceeds 1.5 arcsec or when skies are non - photometric .",
    "all of the raw data from the photometric ccds are archived .",
    "the frames are first read to disk , then written to dlt tape .",
    "over 16 gb per hour are generated from the photometric chips .",
    "when observing in spectroscopic mode , the amount of data generated seems trivial in comparison ( about 6 exposures per hour for each of two cameras for each of two spectrographs , or 24 8 mb frames per hour ) .",
    "all data tapes are shipped by overnight express courier to fermi national accelerator laboratory , near chicago , where the data reduction pipelines are run .",
    "the goal is to turn the imaging data around within a few days , so that one dark run s worth of imaging data will be processed before the next dark run begins , allowing objects to be targeted for spectroscopy .",
    "the data flow serially through several pipelines to identify , measure and extract astronomical images and to apply photometric and astrometric calibrations .",
    "once a significant area of sky has been imaged , a _ target selection _ procedure is then run in order to select objects for followup spectroscopy .",
    "next , an _ adaptive tiling _ algorithm assigns targets to spectroscopic plates and chooses plate centres in order to maximize observing efficiency @xcite .",
    "since galaxies are clustered on the sky , the target density varies from place to place . in regions of high target density",
    ", the adaptive tiling algorithm allows the plates to move slightly closer together so that all targets can be observed .",
    "the plates are then manufactured and shipped to the site .",
    "spectroscopic reduction is also automated .",
    "we are able to obtain correct redshifts for 99% of targeted objects , without human intervention .",
    "the pipelines are integrated into a specially - written environment known as dervish , and the reduced data are stored in an object - oriented database .",
    "there are several distinct spectroscopic samples observed by the survey .",
    "in a survey of this magnitude , it is important that the selection criteria for each sample remain fixed throughout the duration of the survey .",
    "therefore , we spent a whole year obtaining test data with the survey instruments and refining the spectroscopic selection criteria in light of our test data .",
    "now that the survey proper is underway , these criteria have been `` frozen in '' for the duration of the survey .",
    "the * main galaxy sample * @xcite consists of @xmath50 galaxies selected by @xmath32 band magnitude , @xmath51 .",
    "this magnitude limit was chosen as test year data demonstrated that it corresponds closely to the desired target density of 90 objects per square degree .",
    "since galaxies are fuzzy , extended sources , there is no easy way to measure their total magnitude .",
    "most previous surveys have measured the light within an isophote of constant surface brightness , but these isophotal magnitudes will systematically underestimate the flux of galaxies of low intrinsic surface brightness and at high redshift @xmath34 , since observed surface brightness scales as @xmath52 .",
    "simulations have shown that the petrosian magnitude @xcite , which is based on an aperture defined by the ratio of light within an annulus to total light inside that radius , provides probably the least biased and most stable estimate of total magnitude .",
    "we therefore select galaxies according to their petrosian magnitude .",
    "we also apply a surface - brightness limit , @xmath53 mag arcsec@xmath54 , so that we do not waste fibres on galaxies of too low surface brightness to give a reasonable spectrum .",
    "this surface brightness cut eliminates just 0.1% of galaxies that would otherwise be selected for observation .",
    "galaxies in this sample have a median redshift @xmath55 .",
    "we will observe an additional @xmath56 * luminous red galaxies * @xcite .",
    "given photometry in the five survey bands , redshifts can be estimated for the reddest galaxies to @xmath57 or better , and so one can also predict their intrinsic luminosities quite accurately .",
    "the luminous red galaxies , many of which will be so - called central dominant ( cd ) galaxies in cluster cores , provide a valuable supplement to the main galaxy sample since 1 ) they have distinctive spectral features , allowing a redshift to be measured for objects to a flux limit around 1.5 magnitudes fainter than the main sample , and 2 ) they form a volume - limited sample , ie . a sample of uniform density , out to redshift @xmath58",
    "this sample will thus be extremely powerful for studying clustering on the largest scales and for investigating galaxy evolution .",
    "* quasar * candidates @xcite are selected from cuts in multi - colour space and by identifying sources from the first radio catalogue @xcite , with the aim of observing @xmath56 quasars .",
    "this sample will be orders of magnitude larger than any existing quasar catalogue , and will be invaluable for quasar luminosity function , evolution and clustering studies as well as providing sources for followup absorption - line observations .",
    "in addition to the above three classes of spectroscopic sources , which are designed to provide _ statistically complete _ samples , we are also obtaining spectra for many thousands of * stars * and for various * serendipitous * objects .",
    "the latter class includes objects of unusual colour or morphology which do not fit into the earlier classes , plus unusual objects found by other surveys and in other wavebands .",
    "first light with the imaging camera was obtained on 9 may 1998 and the first extra - galactic spectra were obtained in june 1999 .",
    "the survey officially began on 1 april 2000 , and observing is scheduled to end on 30 june 2005 . at the time of writing ( june 2002 ) , we have imaged 4278  square degrees ( 40% of the total survey area ) and obtained spectra for 621  plug - plates , yielding spectra for 264,995  galaxies , 37,612  quasars and 50,023  stars , including some repeated observations .",
    "the spectrographs are performing extremely efficiently , with an overall throughput , including telescope optics but excluding the atmosphere , of 20% in the blue ( 39006000  ) and 25% in the red ( 60009100  ) .",
    "automated spectral reduction pipelines classify these spectra and measure redshifts .",
    "conservatively , we inspect the spectra of roughly 8% of sources , whenever there is any doubt about the reliability of the automated redshift measurement . in seven - eighths of these cases , the automated redshift measurement is in fact confirmed to be correct .",
    "the remaining eighth of these spectra ( 1% overall ) have their redshifts manually corrected .",
    "based on manual inspection of all @xmath59 spectra from 39 plugplates , this procedure correctly measures redshifts for 99.7% of galaxies , 98.0% of quasars and 99.6% of stars .",
    "the first public release of sdss data ( hereafter edr ) took place on 5 june 2001 , and consists of images covering 460 square degrees of sky , photometric parameters for 10 million objects and spectra for 54,000 objects . the main access point to the data is through the website http://www.sdss.org/ and the edr is described in @xcite .",
    "there are presently three ways to access the data , the choice of which depends on the nature of the data required and the experience of the user .",
    "the * skyserver * ( http://skyserver.fnal.gov ) provides a graphical user interface to images of the sky and also enables one to download spectra of specified objects .",
    "it was primarily intended as an interface for the general public and for educational purposes , but new features are being added , making it also useful for professional astronomers .",
    "public interest in the sdss is illustrated by the fact that this web site has been receiving around half a million hits per month .",
    "the * mast * interface ( http://archive.stsci.edu/sdss/ ) allows simple web - based searches around specified objects or positions on the sky .",
    "it is a useful way of retrieving sdss observations for moderate numbers of objects in a small region of the sky .    for accessing sdss data on large numbers of objects , and over larger areas , the sdss query tool * sdssqt * is recommended .",
    "this tool allows one to query the edr database on any measured parameters and to specify which parameters , such as position and magnitude , are to be returned .",

    "the clustering of galaxies is clearly visible in this plot : the galaxies appear to lie within filamentary structures enclosing regions of substantially lower density .",
    "the drop in galaxy density with redshift ( distance from the centre of the plot ) is entirely due to the fact that this sample is limited by apparent flux : only the most luminous galaxies , which are rare , can be seen beyond a redshift @xmath62 .",

    "subsequent data releases will follow at roughly yearly intervals .",
    "although the primary science driver behind the sloan digital sky survey is characterization of the large scale structure of the universe , the survey has already had a significant impact on several branches of astrophysics , from the investigation of asteroids in our own solar system to the discovery of the most distant known objects in the universe . here",
    "i very briefly highlight some interesting results which have come out of the commissioning phase of the survey . for further details ,",
    "please see the original articles as referenced .",
    "asteroids are easily detected in sdss imaging data since they are fast - moving and very nearby ( within the solar system ) , leading to a significant motion relative to the background stars during the 55 s integration time .",
    "they thus appear on sdss images as trails , the length and orientation of which enable the asteroid s orbit to be determined . around",
    "13,000 asteroids have been detected in 500 deg@xmath67 of sdss commissioning data @xcite .",
    "these observations have enabled an accurate determination of the size distribution of asteroids to @xmath68 over the range 0.440 km .",
    "the total number of predicted asteroids with @xmath68 is about a factor of ten smaller than that predicted by an extrapolation from previous observations of brighter asteroids ( @xmath69 ) , and the number of `` killer '' asteroids with diameter @xmath70 km is a factor of about three smaller than previously thought , with a new estimate of roughly one impact per 500,000 years . by completion",
    ", we estimate that the sdss will have observed roughly 100,000 asteroids in five colours , enabling their approximate chemical composition to be determined .",
    "there is already clear evidence for chemical segregation in the belt of asteroids between mars and jupiter .",
    "asteroids in the inner part of the belt are composed mostly of rocky silicates , whereas the outer belt asteroids are primarily carbonaceous .",
    "these observations have important implications for the formation history of the solar system .      moving slightly further afield than the solar system",
    ", the sdss has also been very successful at finding brown dwarfs in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "brown dwarfs are sub - stellar objects which are too small to sustain thermonuclear reactions in their cores , and are thus not true stars , but are larger than planets ( they are thought to be 1070 times the mass of jupiter ) .",
    "they are thus cool , below 2,500 k , and hence very red , enabling them to be easily distinguished from true stars by their colours in the sdss filters .",
    "to date @xcite , sdss has discovered around fifty new brown dwarfs , including four t - dwarfs , also known as methane dwarfs .",
    "the methane dwarfs are so cool , below 1,300 k , that their spectra are dominated by the presence of molecules such as water vapour and methane .",
    "while a methane dwarf , gliese 229b , had already been discovered in orbit around a brighter star , the sdss was the first survey to discover free - floating methane dwarfs . using the discovery technique pioneered by sdss , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) has",
    "since found more than a dozen methane dwarfs @xcite .",
    "although very low in mass , these elusive objects may be very common , and thus may provide a significant fraction of the `` dark matter '' that is known to exist in the milky way . to understand their contribution to the total mass of the milky way",
    "requires determining both their abundance and their mass .",
    "the sdss will be important in addressing both these questions , due to its capability of obtaining precision five - colour photometry over a very large area of sky .",
    "the sdss has discovered an unexpectedly large number of blue stars within 20 degrees of the galactic plane .",
    "it is thought that these stars could be part of a disrupted dwarf galaxy , or a disk - like distribution of stars that is puffier than accepted models of the stellar disk of the galaxy , and flatter than the spherical distribution in the halo @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the model for our galaxy needs to be reconsidered .",
    "one possible explanation is that these star structures came from tidal disruption of nearby dwarf galaxies such as sagittarius , since the ages and metallicities of the stars are consistent with the stellar populations in sagittarius .",
    "the distance to a galaxy can be obtained from its spectroscopic redshift using hubble s law , which says that the recession velocity of a galaxy is linearly proportional to its distance . knowing the distance to a galaxy , its intrinsic luminosity may be determined from its apparent magnitude using the inverse - square law . by calculating the maximum distance to which a galaxy of given luminosity may be seen",
    ", one can find the _ galaxy luminosity function _",
    ", @xmath71 , the number density of galaxies as a function of intrinsic luminosity .",
    "it has long been known that the galaxy lf is well fit by the schechter function @xcite , @xmath72 in which the number density of faint galaxies is described by a power law with index @xmath73 .",
