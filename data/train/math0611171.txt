    "this algebra has a natural filtration : @xmath9 if @xmath10 is a superposition of rational functions with a pole in @xmath2 with multiplicity at most @xmath5 . in case",
    "@xmath11 it means that @xmath12 where @xmath13 are finite borel measures on @xmath2 .",
    "having such representations we may define the operator @xmath14 on @xmath15 if @xmath9 .",
    "we do that by substituting @xmath0 into @xmath16 formally . in the special case above @xmath17    the objective of this paper",
    "is to elaborate the notions used above and demonstrate the viability of this functional calculus in arithmetical sense . that includes the statements of well - definedness , multiplicativity , and locality , which hold under realistic conditions .",
    "inspiration for this work came from three sources : one is the author s interest in taking square roots along special curves in locally convex algebras , cf .",
    "@xcite ; another one is the classical theory of fractional powers of operators with radial spectral cuts , see komatsu @xcite , or the book of martnez carracedo and sanz alix @xcite ; and the third one is the very classical riesz functional calculus , cf .",

    "we will see how these fit into our picture . for a comprehensive review of related matters",
    "see the book of haase @xcite .",
    "although this latter one concentrates on the sectorial case but it is exhaustive in that regard .    in terms of the construction of the calculus outlined above , we can notice that the relationship between the function @xmath18 and the not everywhere defined operator @xmath14 is not immediate .",
    "although we want @xmath14 to specialize to @xmath18 for scalars , we obtain @xmath14 through certain measures @xmath13 : @xmath19    this character also appears in the structure of the paper : sections 15 comprise a function theoretical discussion . in sections 1 and 2 we go through a short discussion of lipschitz curve systems and some elementary properties of integrals of cauchy type .",
    "section 3 is about some finer properties .",
    "the main purpose of this section is that we can formulate the statement of locality later in a slightly stronger form than it would be easier otherwise .",
    "so despite its relative length one can skip this section without much consequence .",
    "section 4 is a reminder to some elementary identities , which , in fact , will be generalized later , but they are included here for the sake of better readability .",
    "section 5 is about normal forms of slowly growing holomorphic functions outside a lipschitz curve system @xmath2 .",
    "practically , it says that internal distributions on @xmath2 ( whatever they are ) are in bijective correspondence to slowly growing holomorphic functions as boundary values , cf .",
    "berenstein and gay @xcite , 3.6 .",
    "the function theoretical part is relatively lengthy but it turns out that once we properly understand what we want to generalize the task itself is surprisingly easy . in sections 69 the functional calculus is actually discussed . in section 6",
    "we restate the statements of section 4 in greater generality , this time applied to multivalued linear operators .",
    "the key observation is that the resolvent identity remains valid , so we can generalize everything . in section 7",
    "we define the function calculus and we discuss its basic properties . in section 8",
    "we examine that how our functional calculus applies to fractional powers . in section 9",
    "we mention some modifications which can be applied .    in terms of conventions , in what follows `` measure '' means borel measure of bounded variation .",
    "they are always considered on @xmath20 , @xmath21 , locally compact topological spaces unless noted otherwise .",
    "we remark that such measures can be well approximated by discrete measures in weak sense , and integration is a question of sequential convergence . in the first part we consider complex measures and scalar integrals . but eventually , in the second part we also consider vector measures or rather vector integrals , depends on viewpoint .",
