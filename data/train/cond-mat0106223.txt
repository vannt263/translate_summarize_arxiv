    "the counter - intuitive phenomenon of effective attractions between like - charges immersed in an electrolyte has recently attracted considerable attention , and questions one of the fundamental tenets of colloid science @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the underlying mechanism is crucial for a correct description of a vast variety of industrial and natural processes , in particular the stability and phase behaviour of colloidal dispersions . in this article",
    ", we investigate the stability of electrostatically swollen stacks of regularly spaced planar colloids or membranes of infinite lateral extension in an electrolyte .",
    "such a one - dimensional geometry describes the early stages of clay swelling @xcite but is also relevant for lamellar phases of charged bilayers @xcite . at the simplest level of mean - field description , with neglect of excluded volume and coulomb correlation effects ,",
    "the inhomogeneous density profiles of microscopic co- and counter - ions forming the electric double layers around the planar macroions can be obtained analytically @xcite .",
    "the resulting poisson - boltzmann osmotic ( or disjoining ) pressure in the stack , is invariably found positive @xcite , which is the signature of the tendency to swell .",
    "this behaviour is reminiscent of the repulsive nature of pair interactions ( as we shall see below , the two phenomena are however distinct ) , established within the same mean - field framework @xcite and recently extended beyond mean - field @xcite , with the possible inclusion of approximate correlation contributions .",
    "note that more refined incorporation of discrete solvent effects by adding a bilinear non local term to the free energy of standard poisson - boltzmann theory has shown the possibility of a net attraction ( negative pressure ) at high surface charges @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present investigation is twofold .",
    "first , we apply the general local density functional formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite to provide a prediction for the stability of stacked or lamellar phases .",
    "we show in section [ sec : swelling ] that the interactions of electric double layers generically lead to swelling whereas describing an equilibrium spacing between the membranes either requires the inclusion of non electrostatic forces ( usually van - der - waals like ) or the consideration of more refined theories .",
    "second , the pair potential problem is considered in section iii with a resulting effective repulsion at all distances , within the same framework that encompasses in particular the non - linear poisson - boltzmann theory .",
    "this statement is consequently in contradiction with the attractive behaviour reported by sogami , shinohara and smalley @xcite .",
    "we show that their controversial finding is attributable to a confusion in the thermodynamic potential describing the electrostatic situation under study .",
    "before setting the framework of the analysis , it is worthwhile to point out that the results obtained in @xcite for a pair of colloids do not apply to the regular stacked situation under scrutiny here ( the precise definition of the geometry is given at the beginning of section iia )",
    ". first of all , the mechanical route followed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( deriving the interactions by integration of the stress tensor over the colloids surfaces ) would yield a vanishing effective force in a regular stack , with cancelling contributions acting on both sides of the platelets , and is thus uninformative about the stability of the array .",
    "moreover , the situation considered in @xcite is that of two colloids immersed in an electrolyte , confined in a cylinder with an axis parallel to the colloids line of centers , and of infinite extension along this axis [ see figure [ figure]-a ) ] .",
    "the assumption of infinite length is crucial for the validity of the effective repulsion ( see appendix [ app : a ] ) and the corresponding confined two - body problem does not include the multi - body stack geometry , for which the confining cylinder ( wigner - seitz cell ) would be a slab of finite length .",
    "this point is in contradiction with one erroneous conclusion reached in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we consider a regular succession of rigid infinite parallel plates located at @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "each plate carries a uniform surface charge @xmath2 , and releases its counter - ions in the electrolyte solution , considered to be a mixture of @xmath3 microions , where species @xmath4 has charge number @xmath5 and local density @xmath6 .",
    "we write the free energy@xcite of the total charge distribution in the wigner - seitz cell around a given platelet ( e.g. that situated at @xmath7 for which the cell is a slab extending between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) as @xmath10\\,d z \\,+\\ ,   \\frac{1}{2 } \\ , \\int_{-h}^h \\rho_c(z)\\,\\psi(z ) \\",
    ",   d z , \\label{eq : lda}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the local total charge distribution , including the microions and the plate ( with global electroneutrality @xmath12 ) .",
    "@xmath13 is expressed per unit area of the macroscopic surfaces . within the primitive model of electrolytes",
    "@xcite , whereby the solvent is regarded as a mere dielectric continuum of permittivity @xmath14 , the total electrostatic potential @xmath15 is the solution of poisson s equation @xmath16 \\label{eq : poisson}\\ ] ] and can be cast in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the appropriate green s function .",
    "the boundary condition of vanishing electric field at @xmath19 is fulfilled by @xmath20 .",
    "this mean - field like reduction of the problem materialized by the introduction of the wigner - seitz slab , may be corrected by correlation terms included in the free energy density @xmath21 . moreover , even if the van der waals energy term @xmath22 is of mean - field form , correlation terms can be accounted for provided they translate into a local correction to the free energy , in the spirit of the approaches depicted in refs @xcite .",
    "consequently , the term @xmath23 in equation ( [ eq : lda ] ) does not reduce in general to the entropic microions contribution ( as in poisson - boltzmann theory @xcite ) but may also include both non mean - field energetic and entropic effects .",
    "of course , the present formalism encompasses the non - linear poisson - boltzmann and modified poisson - boltzmann theories @xcite .      for both",
    "canonical ( fixed ionic content of the electrolyte solution ) and semi grand - canonical ( when the solution is in osmotic equilibrium with a salt reservoir ) descriptions , the optimal density profiles @xmath24 are obtained by minimizing the functional @xmath25 where @xmath26 is either the lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint of fixed average concentration , or the chemical potential of species @xmath4 in the reservoir .",
    "the resulting stationary equations read for all species @xmath4 @xmath27 these implicit relations between the electrostatic potential and the densities \\{@xmath28 } allow to solve poisson s equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) and compute the optimal profile @xmath24 ( hereafter noted @xmath6 without ambiguity ) , from which we deduce the helmholtz free energy @xmath29 , with @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the total internal energy , @xmath32 the absolute temperature and @xmath33 the entropy of the total micro - ions charge distribution in the cell ) .    from the knowledge of @xmath34 , the definition of the thermodynamic potential @xmath35 ( which variations correspond to the reversible work performed by an operator and thus define the osmotic pressure ) requires the specification of the thermodynamic situation under consideration . in the canonical case with constant charge plates , @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "if on the other hand , the platelets are held at constant potential ( e.g. by an external generator ) , @xmath35 is the legendre transform of @xmath34 with respect to the surface charge @xcite , namely @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the surface potential . in the opposite case of a system in equilibrium with a salt reservoir , @xmath39 in any case ,",
    "the osmotic pressure is defined as @xmath40 where @xmath35 depends on the electrostatic situation considered , as explained above .",
    "it is however important to stress that the osmotic pressure should not depend on the electrostatic situation under study , as becomes clear below .",
    "theories that do not result in the above fundamental invariance of @xmath41 can consequently be disposed of .",
    "the free energy variation induced by changing the inter - membrane distance is computed in appendix [ app : b ] with the result @xmath42_{z = h } 2 \\delta h\\,+\\ , \\sum_{\\alpha}\\mu_\\alpha\\delta n_{\\alpha}\\,+\\ , \\psi_{_{\\cal p } } \\delta \\sigma , \\label{eq : fvar}\\ ] ] so that the osmotic pressure reads @xmath43_{z",
    "= h},\\ ] ] independently of the situation of constant potential or constant charge considered .",
    "not surprisingly , the pressure is related to the legendre transform of the free energy density , as for ordinary homogeneous gases @xcite and equals the local stress @xmath44 at the mid - plane between the membranes : @xmath45+\\sum_{\\alpha } n_{\\alpha}(z ) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial n_\\alpha}(z ) .",
    "\\label{eq : piofz}\\ ] ]      when the stack is in osmotic equilibrium with a salt reservoir , the comparison of @xmath41 obtained in section [ ssec : osmotic ] with the pressure exerted by the reservoir quantifies the tendency towards swelling ( @xmath46 ) or collapse ( @xmath47 ) . for consistency ,",
    "the ( neutral ) reservoir needs to be described within the same framework as the electrolyte around the platelet .",
    "the remainder of this section is devoted to the proof that @xmath41 is extremal in the reservoir , and that this extremum is a minimum under fairly general conditions .",
    "we first analyze the @xmath48 dependence of the pressure @xmath49 , defined by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the solution of poisson s equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : piofz ] ) we have @xmath52 that can be recast making use of the stationary condition ( [ eq : station ] ) @xmath53 @xmath49 thus goes through an extremum in the reservoir ( @xmath54 by definition ) where the charge density vanishes ( unlike at the mid - plane @xmath55 where @xmath56 ) .",
    "relation ( [ eq : dpi ] ) together with poisson s equation implies that the local stress introduced in ( [ eq : piofz ] ) fulfills the mechanical equilibrium condition for the fluid of microions : @xmath57 which is the simple form taken in a one - dimensional problem by the condition of vanishing divergence for the generalized maxwell stress tensor in the dielectric medium @xcite .",
    "the second derivative of @xmath49 can be obtained by introducing the hessian matrix @xmath58 @xmath59 that obeys the relation @xmath60 as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : station ] ) .",
    "we thus have @xmath61 which is a positive quantity when the matrix of second derivatives @xmath62 is positive definite . under this assumption , @xmath49 is a convex - up function of the potential and the extremum attained in the reservoir is therefore a minimum , so that @xmath46 .    in spite of the differences outlined at the beginning of section [ sec : swelling ] between the pair potential and the multi - body stacked problems , the method employed here is close to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , and we shall also distinguish two different situations to conclude with the stability analysis    * _ case a ) _ : the free energy density does not depend on the elementary charge @xmath63 ( as in mere mean - field treatments @xcite ) . in the limit @xmath64 ( at fixed valency @xmath65 ) , we obtain a locally neutral mixture where the total free energy functional reduces to the contribution @xmath23 .",
    "the thermodynamic stability criterion of this neutral mixture implies the positive definiteness of the matrix @xmath62 that is independent on @xmath63 .",
    "* _ case b ) _ : correlation or fluctuation effects are taken into account with a resulting @xmath63-dependent free energy density .",
    "it is no longer possible to find an uncharged mixture of micro - species described by the same density @xmath21 .",
    "the thermodynamic stability condition of the full functional ( [ eq : lda ] ) involves the green s function @xmath66 and does not imply the positive definiteness of the hessian @xmath67 .",
    "however , the convexity of @xmath21 with respect to density variations is generally fulfilled by the approaches proposed in the literature , either in the full density range @xcite or for the small plasma coupling parameters relevant to colloidal dispersions @xcite .    from the above discussion and the positive definiteness of the hessian matrix @xmath67 ,",
    "we conclude that the stack generically exhibits a tendency towards swelling .",
    "in this section , we consider within the density functional formalism of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lda ] ) , the problem of the effective interactions between a pair of parallel charged plates immersed in an electrolyte solution of infinite volume ( no confinement ) . the two rigid plates with distance @xmath68",
    "are supposed to be of negligible thickness and uniform surface charge ( as in section [ sec : swelling ] ) ; they divide the electrolyte solution into two disconnected regions ( inner region with @xmath69 and outer region with @xmath70 ) , which does not correspond to the situation analyzed in refs .",
    "however , the generalization to the present case is straightforward and yields an effective repulsion as long as both regions are in contact with salt reservoirs imposing the same chemical potential for micro - species . indeed , from the computation of the free energy variation detailed in section [ ssec : osmotic ] , the effective force can be written @xmath71 from the vanishing of the electric field at @xmath7 and @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 and @xmath74 . for @xmath75 ,",
    "the charge density vanishes so that @xmath76 equals the osmotic pressure in the salt reservoir under consideration .",
    "the argument of section [ ssec : stability ] indicates that @xmath77 and that the interactions are repulsive under the assumption of positive definiteness for the stability matrix .",
    "this last condition is obeyed by poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory independently of the valency of the microions [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : freepb ] ) below ] .",
    "our result is consequently in contradiction with the `` long - range weak attractive part of the free energy '' reported in @xcite for the same system treated at the level of poisson - boltzmann . the work of sogami _ et al .",
    "_ has already been criticized @xcite , but in our opinion , the subsequent controversy @xcite dwells on ambiguities on the thermodynamic potential that should be considered , which to our knowledge , have not been explicitly pointed out so far .",
    "it thus seems worthwhile to restrict to pb theory and devote the remainder of this article to briefly revisit the model of @xcite , introduced to describe the swelling behaviour of n - butyl - ammonium vermiculite gels .    within pb mean - field theory ,",
    "the microions are considered as an ideal gas and density fluctuations discarded , so that the free energy density does not include any correlation term and reduces to the entropy of an ideal mixture : @xmath78 , \\label{eq : freepb}\\ ] ] where the ( irrelevant ) lengths @xmath79 involve the masses of microions and @xmath80 is the inverse temperature .",

    "( [ eq : mualpha ] ) are simply the prefactors of the exponentials in ( [ eq : density ] ) ] .",

    "the electrostatic potential is imposed to be continuous throughout the system and the surface potential @xmath96 is independent on the distance @xmath68 between the plates .",

    "consequently , the thermodynamic potential @xmath98 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : constantpot ] ) should be used in computing the force whereas @xmath34 has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the definition of the model imposes that when @xmath9 changes at fixed @xmath96 , @xmath95 is constant while @xmath94 varies , so that the two situations of constant charge and constant potential are equivalent for the outer part of the system ( @xmath70 ) , but not for the inner part . the reversible work performed by an operator changing the distance @xmath68 between the charged plates",

    "it can be checked that in the dual situation where both the inner @xmath90 are outer @xmath92 surface charges are held constant , the effective force is still given by ( [ eq : potea ] ) .",

    "describing the interactions between the electric double - layers around charged planar colloids with a local density functional theory for ionic screening and the primitive model of electrolytes , we have shown that a regular stack of such plates generally displays a swelling behaviour when electrostatic forces alone are taken into account . within the same framework , the effective pair potential is found to be repulsive at all distances , in contradistinction with the results derived in @xcite .",
    "the repulsive interactions are evidenced without resort to an explicit solution of poisson s equation , and are related to the convexity of the underlying free energy functional , as already noted in @xcite .",
    "of course , the present result does not preclude the possibility of effective attractive pair potentials .",
    "in particular , a drawback of the theories encompassed by eq . ( [ eq : lda ] ) is that the direct correlation function @xmath109 defined as the second functional derivative of @xmath13 is necessarily mean - field like : @xmath110 with a @xmath111-correlated short range part .",
    "this shortcoming may be circumvented by the inclusion of non - local terms in the theory , e.g. in the spirit of the weighted density approximation @xcite .",
    "however , we expect the local formalism considered here to be instructive for inter - plate separations much larger than the ionic size .",
    "references @xcite proved that the effective interactions between a pair of like - charged colloids immersed with counter - ions and salt in a confining cylinder of infinite extension [ see figure [ figure]-a ) ] were repulsive .",
    "we show here that the result does not hold for a finite length cylinder .",
    "we consider two colloids confined in the cylinder of length @xmath68 represented in figure [ figure]-b ) , in the specific case of neumann boundary conditions on the surface @xmath112 ( vanishing normal electric field ) . due to the mirror symmetry of the charge distribution",
    ", the electric field has no @xmath113-component in the plane @xmath7 , and the problem is equivalent to that of a unique colloid ( say colloid 1 ) in a sub - cell cylinder of length @xmath9 , with again neumann boundary conditions [ the right half part of the cylinder , indicated by a dotted rectangle in fig . [",
    "figure]-b ) ] .",
    "we assume the effective force acting on colloid 1 repulsive ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "then , we translate along the @xmath113 axis the left half cell ( @xmath115 ) by a distance @xmath68 , keeping the right half fixed .",
    "the electrostatic potential around colloid 1 is unaffected , so that the effective force is unchanged , corresponding now to an effective attraction . any repulsive configuration with neumann boundary conditions on the confining cylinder",
    "can then be mapped onto an attractive one ( from the construction of the mapping , it appears that this feature disappears in the limit @xmath116 ) .",
    "the hypothesis of infinite length is thus a key ingredient of the proofs in refs .",
    "it is moreover worthwhile to note that numerical solutions of the non - linear poisson - boltzmann equation for finite - size disc - like clay platelets confined in a finite length wigner - seitz cylinder , show repulsive effective pair forces when the distance between the clay particles is smaller than the half length @xmath9 of the cylinder @xcite .",

    "consequently , while the effective interactions remain repulsive when the specific size of the micro - ions is taken into account via the modified poisson - boltzmann theory put forward in @xcite , a similar conclusion can not be reached for the situation of complete confinement ( finite length of the confining cylinder ) .",
    "appendix [ app : a ] provides a simple counter - example showing that effective attraction can result from complete lateral confinement .",
