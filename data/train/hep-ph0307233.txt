    "in a recent work @xcite it was demonstrated that chiral coupled - channel dynamics generates heavy - light meson resonances with quantum numbers @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "such states were first predicted in @xcite based on the chiral quark model and recently observed for the first time by the babar and cleo collaborations @xcite . due to the different dynamical assumptions of the chiral quark model versus the chiral coupled - channel approach",
    "the theoretical prediction are quite different ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most spectacular is the prediction of @xmath6 and @xmath7 heavy - light meson states with negative strangeness . whereas the chiral quark model implies an anti - triplet of open - charm or open - bottom states only ,",
    "an additional sextet of states was predicted in @xcite .",
    "these findings suggest that the chiral su(3 ) symmetry plays a decisive role also in the physics of heavy - light baryons .",
    "double - charm or double - bottom baryon states are completely analogous to the heavy - light mesons and all results from @xcite can be straightforwardly taken over to this sector . therefore in this paper",

    "lagrangian with heavy - light baryon fields that transform non - linearly under the chiral su(3 ) group a coupled - channel description of the meson - baryon scattering in the open charm sector is developed .",
    "the crucial importance of coupled - channel dynamics for the baryon - resonance formation in the u-,d-,s - sector of qcd was first anticipated in a series of works in the sixties @xcite .",
    "related works based on the chiral su(3 ) lagrangian are @xcite .",
    "our major result is the prediction that there exist open - charm states with @xmath0 quantum numbers forming one anti - quindecimplet , two anti - triplet and two sextet representations of the su(3 ) group .",
