    "the recent discovery of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) lends support to the hypothesis that structure in the universe formed via gravitational instability from small density perturbations .",
    "furthermore , the observed anisotropy allows us to characterize the initial perturbations statistically with enough precision to draw important cosmological conclusions .",
    "in particular , the cobe detection ( smoot et al .",
    "1992 , bennett et al .",
    "1994 ) shows that density perturbations existed on scales larger than the horizon at the epoch of recombination .",
    "furthermore , the data are consistent with the hypothesis that the perturbations are gaussian distributed and can be used to place constraints on the power spectrum of the initial density perturbations .",
    "cmb anisotropy is already one of the most important pieces of cosmological data , and in coming years its importance will only increase .    in recent years",
    ", many cosmologists have favored theories in which the density parameter @xmath0 is equal to one . in particular , this value for @xmath0 is predicted by the simplest versions of the popular inflationary scenario .",
    "however , many dynamical measurements indicate a low - density universe ( peebles 1993 , ratra peebles 1994a ) .",
    "it is well known that the standard cobe - normalized cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario , in which universe is flat and contains only baryons and cdm particles , and in which the initial density perturbations are of the harrison - zeldovich type , predicts fluctuations that are too large in amplitude on scales of galaxy clusters and below , although a number of slight variants on this model can be devised that fit the data better ( _ e.g. _ , bunn , scott , & white 1995 ; white et al .  1995 ) .",
    "there are two classes of low - density cosmological model that can be motivated by the inflationary universe scenario .",
    "one is the @xmath4-model . in this model",
    "the matter density is small , so @xmath5 ; however , the cosmological constant contributes to the total mean density required to make the universe flat : @xmath6 .",
    "the usual inflationary scenarios predict that the universe is flat , so that @xmath7 must be extremely close to unity ( kashlinsky , tkachev , frieman 1994 ) .",
    "the cosmological constant is equal to the vacuum energy density of the universe .",
    "although we have no reason to be certain that it must be zero , the values that are of interest to cosmologists ( _ i.e. _ , the values that make @xmath8 of order unity ) are unnaturally small from the point of view of particle physics ( weinberg 1989 ) , and so these @xmath4-models are often regarded as unappealing .    the other class of low - density inflationary scenario is the open model , in which the universe has negative spatial curvature .",
    "recently , the possibility of realizing an open universe has been discussed in the context of inflation theory ( bucher , goldhaber , turok 1994 ; yamamoto , sasaki , tanaka 1995 ; linde 1995 ; linde mezhlumian 1995 ) . the essential idea is based on the semiclassical picture of a bubble nucleation , which is described by a bounce solution ( coleman de  luccia 1980 ) .",
    "one bubble nucleation process can be regarded as the creation of a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime with negative spatial curvature inside the bubble due to the @xmath9-symmetry of the bounce solution .",
    "it is of great interest to ask whether an open universe created in this one - bubble inflationary scenario is observationally acceptable or not .",
    "open cdm models have been investigated by many authors ( lyth stewart 1990 ; ratra peebles 1994ab ; sugiyama silk 1994 ; kamionkowski et al .",
    "1994 ; grski et al . 1995 ; liddle et al . 1995 ) .",
    "their investigations are based on the simple assumption that the quantum state of a scalar field is in the conformal vacuum state at the inflationary stage ; however , this is unlikely to be the prediction of the one - bubble inflationary scenario .",
    "it has been pointed out that if we take the bunch - davies vacuum state as the state of scalar field , the cmb anisotropy in a low @xmath0 universe appears quite different due to the super - curvature mode ( yamamoto , sasaki , tanaka 1995 ) .    following the usual inflationary picture in which the quantum fluctuation of a scalar field generates the density perturbation",
    ", we must investigate the quantum state of fields inside the bubble .",
    "attempts have been made to study this problem by developing a field - theoretical formalism based on a multidimensional tunneling wave function ( tanaka , sasaki , yamamoto 1994 ; sasaki et al .",
    "1994 ; tanaka sasaki 1994 ; yamamoto , tanaka , sasaki 1995 ; hamazaki et al .",
    "bucher et al . have also considered this problem ( bucher , goldhaber turok 1994 ; bucher turok 1995 ) .",
    "however , this problem requires further investigation .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the simple case in which the quantum state of a scalar field is in the bunch - davies vacuum state , and compare the predictions of this model with several cosmological observations .",
    "this situation is physically definite and clear , and as long as the bubble nucleation occurs in the de sitter inflationary background ( where the initial inflationary period has lasted sufficiently long ) , the field can be approximated by the bunch - davies vacuum state , provided that the effect of the bubble nucleation process is negligible .    in section 2 , we first consider the initial spectrum by solving for the evolution of cosmological perturbations in the open inflationary stage . in section 3",
    "we use this initial power spectrum to calculate various cosmological quantities and compare these predictions with observations .",
    "we also compare these results with those of a previous analysis of the open inflationary model based on the conformal vacuum state , and a @xmath4-model with harrison - zeldovich spectrum .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a discussion of our results .",
    "we will work in units where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "in this section , we consider the evolution of cosmological perturbations in an open inflationary stage and derive the initial spectrum of perturbations .",
    "ratra peebles ( 1994b ) have investigated the evolution of cosmological perturbations in an open inflationary universe with gauge fixed .",
    "bucher , goldhaber turok ( 1994 ) have also investigated cosmological perturbations in an inflationary stage in the gauge - invariant formalism . in the first half of this section ,",
    "we follow the work by bucher , goldhaber turok ( 1994 ) .    in an open universe",
    "the line element can be written as @xmath12 , \\label{metric}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is conformal time .",
    "we consider a scalar field @xmath14 with potential @xmath15 , which drives inflation .",

    "the small fluctuation @xmath20 gives rise to a metric perturbation .",
    "as we are interested in a scalar perturbation in a scalar field dominated universe , the metric perturbation can be written , @xmath21.\\ ] ] @xmath22 corresponds to the curvature perturbation or gravitational potential .",
    "then we get the evolution equations for the perturbation ( mukhanov , feldman , brandenberger 1992 ) , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the laplacian on the unit sphere .",
    "now let us consider an inflationary stage of the universe inside a bubble . to solve the above equations analytically",
    ", we assume that the potential is nearly flat , and use the approximation , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "we also assume that the background spacetime is approximated by de sitter spacetime , that is , @xmath28 .",
    "then the field equation for the homogeneous part is @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "( [ phi0eq ] ) can be integrated , giving @xmath31 and the perturbation equation ( [ eqphi ] ) reduces to , @xmath32    to solve these equations , we need the initial values . to determine the initial values , we must investigate the problem of what the quantum state is inside the bubble . as mentioned before , this is a very important problem , which demands further investigation .",
    "we here consider the case in which the scalar field is in the bunch - davies vacuum state .",
    "this is the case provided that the effect of bubble nucleation process is small and negligible .",
    "but we should keep in mind that this point needs examination in the various models of one - bubble inflation scenario , taking into consideration the effect of bubble nucleation .",
    "recently , quantum field theory in de sitter space - time associated with the open chart has been investigated ( sasaki , tanaka , yamamoto 1995 ) . according to this analysis",
    ", a quantized scalar field with mass @xmath33 in the bunch - davies vacuum state is described in the second quantized manner as , @xmath34 where @xmath35{1\\over a(\\eta ) } , \\label{chi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath36 @xmath37 takes on the values @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the annihilation operator , and @xmath40 is the gamma function .",
    "the orthonormal harmonics on a three - dimensional unit hyperboloid @xmath41 are @xmath42 with normalization @xmath43 in the above expression , the usual harmonics behave as @xmath44 at scales larger than the curvature scale , @xmath45 , although @xmath46 is constant for @xmath45 .",
    "thus @xmath46 represents a fluctuation larger than the curvature scale , so we call this mode a super - curvature mode",
    ". the necessity of super - curvature modes for a complete description of a random field in an open universe has also been discussed by lyth woszczyna ( 1995 ) .",
    "next , let us consider the curvature perturbation , which can be written in the mode - expanded form @xmath47    for the continuous mode @xmath48 , eq.([eqphi ] ) reduces to @xmath49 the solution that behaves like @xmath50 as @xmath51 is ( bucher turok 1995 ) @xmath52 the equation for the super - curvature mode is @xmath53 and we find a solution @xmath54    to determine the amplitude of @xmath22 , we use eq.([connect ] ) . from the behavior at @xmath55",
    ", we find for the continuous mode @xmath56 and for the super - curvature mode @xmath57    we therefore have the following spectrum at the end of inflation , by taking the limit @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60    for comparison , we also investigate the case when the scalar field is assumed to be in the conformal vacuum state ( lyth stewart 1990 , ratra peebles 1994b ) . in this case , the scalar field is written @xmath61 where @xmath62 after a similar analysis , we get the spectrum of curvature perturbations at the end of inflation , @xmath63 the conformal vacuum case differs from the bunch - davies vacuum case in two ways , the factor @xmath64 and the super - curvature mode .",
    "lyth stewart ( 1990 ) have investigated perturbations in an open inflationary universe , and have given a relation to relate the curvature perturbation and the scalar field perturbation @xmath65 , though a paper justifying this relation has never been published .",
    "but the above investigation shows the correctness of their result on all scales except for the small difference of the former coefficient .",
    "now we start testing the predictions of the open universe in the context of cdm cosmology with the initial conditions obtained above .",
    "the matter - dominated open universe has the line element ( [ metric ] ) with @xmath66 . in this section",
    "we use @xmath67 as the conformal time in the matter - dominated universe .",
    "let us first consider the cmb temperature fluctuation .",
    "having obtained an initial perturbation spectrum , we can compute the temperature fluctuations in the gauge - invariant formalism ( sugiyama gouda 1992 ) . as usual",
    ", we write the temperature autocorrelation in the form , @xmath68 figure 1(a ) shows the power spectrum of temperature fluctuations , @xmath69 , for various values of @xmath0 with initial conditions associated with the bunch - davies vacuum state .",
    "we have taken @xmath70 and hubble parameter @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , respectively , to take the age problem into consideration .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows the same quantities with the conformal vacuum state ( kamionkowski et al . 1994 ;",
    "grski et al . 1995 ) . for reference",
    ", we show the corresponding results for a @xmath4-model with a harrison zeldovich spectrum in figure 1(c ) ( sugiyama 1995 ) . here the parameter @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we also show the results of several cmb experiments , taken from the paper by scott , silk white ( 1995 ) .",
    "open models may have trouble fitting the data near the `` doppler peak '' on degree scales , although assessing the significance of this problem will require very careful investigation ( ratra et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the differences between fig.1(a ) and fig.1(b ) at low multipoles come almost entirely from the contribution of the super - curvature mode ( yamamoto , sasaki , tanaka 1995 ) , @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the recombination time and the present time , respectively , @xmath85 is defined in eq.([vstar ] ) , and @xmath86 is the decay factor of the curvature perturbation , @xmath87    the most accurate and reliable cmb anisotropy data at the present time come from the cobe dmr experiment .",
    "in addition to providing us with accurate estimates of the fluctuation amplitude , the data from this experiment can be used to constrain the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "we have used the two - year cobe data ( bennett et al .",
    "1994 ) to place constraints on open inflationary models , following a procedure based on the karhunen - love transform ( bunn , scott , & white 1994 ; bunn & sugiyama 1995 ; white & bunn 1995 ; bunn 1995ab ) .",
    "this procedure gives results that are generally consistent with the spherical - harmonic technique devised by grski ( 1994 ) .",
    "we will now describe this procedure .    in inflationary cosmological models ,",
    "the cmb anisotropy is a realization of a gaussian random field .",
    "if we expand the anisotropy in spherical harmonics , @xmath88 then each coefficient @xmath89 is an independent gaussian random variable of zero mean .",
    "furthermore , the variance of @xmath89 is simply @xmath90 . with this information",
    ", we can in principle compute the probability density @xmath91 of getting the actual cobe data @xmath92 given a power spectrum @xmath90 : since each data point is a linear combination of gaussian random variables , the probability distribution @xmath92 is simply a multivariate gaussian , @xmath93 where the covariance matrix @xmath94 can be written in terms of the power spectrum and the noise covariance matrix .    let us restrict our attention to a few - parameter family of possible power spectra .",
    "we will denote the parameters generically by @xmath95 . in this paper , for example , we will consider power spectra that are parameterized by two parameters , the density parameter @xmath0 and the power spectrum normalization @xmath96 , and so @xmath95 will be a two - dimensional vector .",
    "the probability density in equation ( [ gaussprob ] ) is then simply the probability density @xmath97 of the data @xmath92 given the parameters @xmath95 .",
    "if we adopt a bayesian view of statistics , we can convert this into a probability density for the parameters given the data : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the prior probability density we choose to adopt .",
    "@xmath100 is generally denoted @xmath101 and called the likelihood .",
    "the choice of prior distribution is a notoriously troublesome issue . in practice",
    ", one generally chooses a prior that is a smooth , slowly - varying function of the parameters . in this paper",
    ", we will adopt a prior that is uniform in @xmath0 and one that is uniform in @xmath102 .",
    "( this prior is approximately equivalent to one that is uniform in the power spectrum normalization @xmath103 near the `` pivot point . ''",
    "it differs slightly from one that is uniform in @xmath104 , although not enough to affect our results significantly . )    unfortunately , in order to compute the probability density @xmath105 , and hence the likelihood @xmath106 , one must invert a matrix of dimension equal to the number of data points . for the cobe dmr data , this number is of order 4000 .",
    "such exact likelihoods have been computed for a small class of models ( tegmark & bunn 1995 ) ; however , this is quite a time - consuming procedure .",
    "the karhunen - love transform allows us to `` compress '' the data from 4000 numbers to only 400 in a way that throws away very little of the actual cosmological signal .",
    "the likelihoods estimated from the transformed data approximate the true likelihoods well , and are much more efficient to compute . for details on how the karhunen - love transform is performed ,",
    "see white & bunn ( 1995 ) and bunn ( 1995ab ) .",
    "once we know @xmath106 , it is quite easy to place constraints on the parameters @xmath95 .",
    "since @xmath106 is a probability distribution for @xmath95 , it should be normalized so that @xmath107 now suppose that we choose some subset @xmath108 of possible parameter values .",
    "then if @xmath109 then we can say that @xmath95 lies in the region @xmath108 with probability @xmath110 .",
    "if we want to find a 95% confidence interval , we simply find a region @xmath108 such that @xmath111 .",
    "one frequently chooses @xmath108 to be the region enclosed by a contour of constant likelihood .",
    "if one of the parameters is deemed to be uninteresting , the standard practice is to `` marginalize '' over it .",
    "for example , if we are interested in constraining @xmath0 but not @xmath104 , then we replace @xmath112 by @xmath113 this is a natural thing to do : if @xmath106 is the joint probability density for @xmath0 and @xmath104 , then @xmath114 is the probability density for @xmath0 alone .",
    "figure 2 shows the contours of the likelihood @xmath112 for open models associated with the bunch - davies vacuum state .",
    "in computing these likelihoods , we use a linear combination of the 53 and 90 ghz two - year cobe maps , with weights chosen to minimize the noise .",
    "we use the ecliptic - projected maps ; maps that were made in galactic coordinates , and therefore have different pixelization , give normalizations that are generally lower by a few percent ( stompor , grski & banday 1995 ; bunn 1995a ) .",
    "the choice of pixelization appears to affect primarily the overall normalization of models ; likelihood ratios of models with power spectra of different shapes are less affected ( bunn 1995ab ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the marginal likelihoods for @xmath0 for both the bunch - davies and the conformal vacuum open models . in the bunch - davies case , we find that @xmath115 at 95% confidence and @xmath116 at 99% confidence",
    ". we also show the confidence levels for various @xmath0 in table 1 .",
    "for the conformal vacuum models , the likelihood is bimodal , and so the allowed regions are not connected .",
    "if we take a cut at small @xmath0 and only consider the region @xmath117 , we can state that at 95% confidence either @xmath118 or @xmath119 , and 99% confidence , either @xmath120 or @xmath121 .",
    "there are difficulties associated with the interpretation of the likelihoods in this case ( grski et al .",
    "1995 ) .    of course , the likelihood @xmath112 provides us with accurate normalizations in addition to shape constraints .",
    "for any particular value of @xmath0 , we find the value of @xmath104 that maximizes the likelihood and use this value as the power spectrum normalization .",
    "the normalizations determined in this way have typical one - sigma fractional uncertainties of approximately @xmath122 .",
    "the maximum - likelihood normalizations computed in this way are listed in the second column of table 2(a ) for the bunch - davies vacuum case . for comparison ,",
    "we have also computed the conformal vacuum case ; these normalizations are given in the second column of table 2(b ) .",
    "we next consider the matter inhomogeneities using the cobe normalization as described above . as the density perturbation @xmath123",
    "is related to the curvature perturbation @xmath22 by the gravitational poisson equation ( kodama sasaki 1984 ) , @xmath124 in linear perturbation theory , we can write the power spectrum of the matter perturbation in an open universe from eq.([specnm ] ) , @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128",
    ". the super - curvature mode does not contribute on small scales .",
    "the model based on the conformal vacuum state leads to the same form but without the factor @xmath64 . in the cdm cosmology ,",

    "the cobe dmr normalization determines the amplitude of the fluctuation .",
    "we give the numerical value of @xmath131 determined from the likelihood normalization in the second column in table 2(a ) . the second column in table 2(b ) gives the value for the conformal vacuum case , in which the power spectrum is obtained by eq.([pk ] ) without the factor @xmath64 .",
    "we show in figure 4(a ) the density power spectrum @xmath132 , for various @xmath0 , with initial conditions based on the bunch - davies vacuum state .",

    "the difference is @xmath143 percent at @xmath144 , but is a few percent even at @xmath75 .",

    "the @xmath4-model therefore needs low @xmath181 or a tilted spectrum ( ostriker steinhardt 1995 ) . for the range @xmath148 , open models give unacceptably small bulk velocities compared with the potent analysis .",
    "however , given the present quality of the velocity data and the problem of cosmic variance , one might be reluctant to draw strong conclusions from this fact .",
    "the rough estimation associated with the galaxy formation gives lower bound of @xmath0 consistent with the value discussed above .",
    "it is very interesting that the cobe likelihood analysis has given the most severe constraint on this open model .",
    "the cobe likelihood analysis strongly prefers a high value of @xmath0 .",
    "the peak value is around @xmath182 , and we can state that @xmath183 with @xmath175 confidence in this model . considering both the cobe analysis and the matter inhomogeneity , we are led to prefer a value of @xmath184 if the one - bubble inflationary scenario is correct .",
    "such a model is consistent with the press - schechter analysis of the epoch of galaxy formation and is marginally consistent with the bulk velocity data .",
    "as the cmb data continue to improve , particularly on degree scales , we should be able to test this model .",
    "it is premature to rule out low @xmath0 inflationary models on the basis of this investigation at present , because we do not include the effect of bubble nucleation in the calculation of initial density power spectrum .",
    "previous analysis indicates that the bubble nucleation effect in general excites fluctuations , and amplifies the perturbations on scales larger than curvature scale ( yamamoto , tanaka , sasaki 1995 ; hamazaki et al .",
    "one might therefore expect low - density models to fit the cobe data even more poorly once this effect is taken into account ; however , since the calculation has not been done , we can not be certain . in particular , the status of the super - curvature mode is still quite uncertain",
    ".    various modifications of the open model may also be viable .",
    "we must investigate the effect of gravity waves in an open inflationary universe .",
    "one might also consider the effect of tilting the primordial power spectrum ; however , in order to improve the fit to the data one would probably need to tilt the power spectrum to have increased power on small scales , and such `` blue '' power spectra are not naturally produced by inflation .",
    "such a model is probably too contrived to be plausible .",
    "we would like thank n. sugiyama for providing us with the cmb anisotropy power spectra and for helpful discussions and comments .",
