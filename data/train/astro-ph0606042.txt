    "we investigate the influence of changing @xmath5 in the range of @xmath47      we calculate light element nucleosynthesis using the same supernova explosion model adopted in our previous studies @xcite .",
    "the presupernova model is 14e1 model , which is a 16.2 @xmath3 star just before the supernova explosion and corresponds to sn 1987a @xcite .",

    "the mass cut is located at 1.61 @xmath3 .",
    "note that it is not needed to calculate the structure inside the mass cut . in the present study",
    ", we calculate neutrino oscillations with the density structure of the presupernova model .",
    "when the shock front is in inner high density region , there is no influence of the shock propagation to the neutrino oscillations .",
    "this is because the oscillation amplitude is too small despite the presence of the shock wave in such a high density region .",
    "its effect will be discussed in detail in  5 .",
    "our nuclear reaction network consists of 291 species of nuclei from @xmath49 , @xmath50 , to ge .",
    "the included nuclear species and their associated nuclear reactions are the same as those in @xcite , except charged - current @xmath0-process reactions on @xmath14he and @xmath51c , which will be discussed later in this subsection .",
    "the rates of neutral - current @xmath0-process reactions and those of the other charged - current reactions are adopted from the rates with the assumption of fd distribution of the neutrino spectra .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , the rates of the neutral - current reactions do not change by neutrino oscillations .",
    "when we consider neutrino oscillations , the energy spectra of @xmath10 and @xmath19 emitted from a proto - neutron star change from fd distributions and charged - current @xmath0-process reaction rates are not merely simple functions of neutrino temperatures .",
    "in such a condition , we need to evaluate a neutrino flux as a function of the neutrino energy .",
    "the number flux of @xmath33-flavor neutrinos ( @xmath52 ) emitted from the proto - neutron star with the energy of @xmath34 can be written as @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the luminosity of @xmath33-flavor neutrinos , @xmath11 is the radius , @xmath56 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath57 is the neutrino temperature , and @xmath58 is the degeneracy factor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we define @xmath59 as the oscillation probability from @xmath33-flavor to @xmath60-flavor at the radius of @xmath11 and the energy of @xmath34 . taking the cross section of a @xmath0-process reaction as a function of @xmath34 , @xmath61",
    ", we evaluate the reaction rate with neutrino oscillations @xmath62 as @xmath63 in the present study , we consider the effect on neutrino oscillations for charged - current reactions of @xmath14he , @xmath14he(@xmath17he and @xmath14he(@xmath18h , and the reactions of @xmath51c , @xmath51c(@xmath64c , @xmath51c(@xmath65n , @xmath51c(@xmath66b , and @xmath51c(@xmath67b .",
    "however , the detailed data of the cross sections of these reactions as functions of @xmath34 have not been reported and one can find only energy averaged reaction rates as functions of neutrino temperature .",
    "therefore , we adopt analytical approximation to the cross sections with respect to @xmath34 as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the threshold energy of each reaction .",
    "coefficients are determined so as to fit the rate of the corresponding reaction with the assumption of the fd distributions to the values tabulated in the 1992 work by r. d. hoffman & s. e. woosley , hw92 .",
    "the coefficients and the thresholds are listed in table 1 . when we evaluate the reaction rates from the cross sections with assumptions of the fd distributions , these values are in reasonable agreement with those of hw92 within @xmath70 % .",
    "in order to evaluate the reaction rates of the charged - current @xmath0-process reactions with neutrino oscillations , we numerically solve the oscillations of the neutrinos passing through a presupernova star in runge - kutta method and based on analytical expression of @xcite .",
    "we use the density profile of 14e1 model of shigeyama & nomoto ( 1990 ) .",
    "the density profile is shown in fig . 1 in shigeyama & nomoto ( 1990 ) .",
    "when neutrinos pass through the stellar interior , there are resonances of neutrino oscillations where the transition probabilities change largely . the resonance density @xmath71 is determined from the squared mass difference and the neutrino energy .",
    "the resonance density is written as @xmath72 electron number density @xmath73 relates to the density and electron fraction through @xmath74 .",
    "the transition probabilities depend on the adiabaticity of the resonance strongly .",
    "the adiabaticity is estimated using the adiabaticity parameter @xmath75 .",
    "the flip probability @xmath76 , which means the probability that a neutrino in one mass eigenstate changes to another mass eigenstate is written as ( e.g. , dighe & smirnov 2000 ) @xmath77 and @xmath78 when @xmath79 , i.e. , the flip probability @xmath76 is very small ( @xmath80 ) , the resonance is adiabatic . when the flip probability is close to unity , the resonance is nonadiabatic .",
    "figure 1 shows the transition probability of @xmath10 to @xmath10 , @xmath81 , the sum of the transition probabilities of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and the corresponding transition probabilities for antineutrinos @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the case of @xmath87 mev and normal mass hierarchy .",
    "there are resonances of @xmath88 and @xmath5 , which is called h - resonance , at @xmath89 g @xmath90 and of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , which is called l - resonance , at @xmath93 g @xmath90 .",
    "the h - resonance is located in innermost region of the he / c layer ( @xmath94 ) and the l - resonance is in the he / c layer ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "both of h- and l - resonances appear for neutrinos and do not appear for antineutrinos .",
    "the adiabaticity of h - resonance depends on the value of @xmath12 .",
    "l - resonance is always adiabatic in our parameter set .",

    "the flavor change occurs as if there is no resonance .",
    "the increase in charged - current @xmath0-process reaction rates strongly depends on the adiabaticity of h - resonance .",
    "if h - resonance is adiabatic , the reaction rates of charged - current reactions for @xmath10 ( normal mass hierarchy ) and @xmath19 ( inverted mass hierarchy ) become much larger than those without the oscillations in the he - layer . if h - resonance is nonadiabatic",
    ", the increase in the rates of corresponding charged - current reactions would be much smaller .",
    "therefore , the adiabaticity of h - resonance affects the final yields of @xmath1li and @xmath2b .",
    "we note that the shock propagation effect on neutrino oscillations in supernova ejecta is not considered in this study .",
    "we do not consider that the change of neutrino oscillations due to the shock propagation would change the yields of @xmath1li and @xmath2b .",
    "when neutrinos pass through the o / ne layer , the amplitude of neutrino oscillations is very small because the density profile , where the density is much larger than h - resonance density , does not affect neutrino oscillations .",
    "thus , when the shock wave moves inside the o / c layer , the shock wave does not affect the transition probabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos even if we consider the shock propagation .",
    "after the shock wave arrives at the o / c layer , the shock wave will change the transition probabilities .",
    "we set the decay time of the neutrino flux to be 3 s which is to be compared with the shock arrival time to the o / c layer about 5 s. because of this time lag , more than 80% of neutrinos pass through the supernova ejecta before the shock arrives at the o / c layer .",

    "the shock propagation effect of the neutrino oscillations is seen in the case of h - resonance close to adiabatic .",
    "next , we consider the case of inverted mass hierarchy . compared with the case of normal mass hierarchy , the decrease in the yield ratios are smaller ; they are 1% level in the case of @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that in the inverted mass hierarchy not only the effect of neutrino oscillations itself but also the shock propagation effect is smaller than the case of normal mass hierarchy .",
    "the shock propagation effect on the neutrino oscillations is seen in @xmath179 s when the shock front reaches the o / c layer or the inner region of the he / c layer .",

    "detailed studies of massive star evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "stellar models including semiconvection and convective overshooting mixing also have large o - rich layers @xcite .",

    "as discussed in  5.2 , treatment of convection may also change stellar structure and abundance distribution .",
    "aspherical explosion may produce different amount of light elements . in our study ,",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath0-process reaction cross sections is very simplified : more precise evaluation of the energy dependence is required @xcite . in order to evaluate the enhancement factor due to neutrino oscillations , we need to construct more precise nucleosynthesis model in massive star evolution and supernova explosions .",
    "we also need to observe @xmath1li/@xmath2b ratio and li abundance in stars having traces of a definite supernova .",
    "we showed the possibility of constraining parameters of neutrino oscillations from the viewpoint of nucleosynthesis .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath1li/@xmath2b ratio and @xmath1li abundance would be seen in the normal mass hierarchy and adiabatic h - resonance .",
    "there are different approaches to constrain neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "one is to constrain neutrino masses from cosmological observations .",
    "massive neutrinos produced in the early universe affect cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum and structure formation , i.e. , the shape of matter power spectrum ( review in * ? ? ?",
    "constraining the total mass of mass eigenstates of neutrinos ( @xmath205 ) from cosmological observations has been carried out .",
    "an upper limit of the total neutrino mass , @xmath206 ev at 95% c.l .",
    ", has been deduced by fitting cosmological parameters combined with the analyses of wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) cmb , galaxy clustering , galaxy bias , and ly@xmath162 forest of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite . in the near future higher precision cosmological observations",
    "would reduce upper limit of the total neutrino mass , from which the squared mass difference and mass hierarchy also would be determined .",
    "observations of diffuse supernova neutrino background ( dsnb ) may constrain parameters of neutrino oscillations , too . although dsnb has not been detected yet",
    ", future improved neutrino detectors may detect dsnb .",
    "@xcite proposed a gadolinium - enhanced super - kamiokande detector by which average @xmath19 energy and the total @xmath19 energy per supernova are to be measured after five years run .",
    "further , @xcite discussed that , in the inverted mass hierarchy and adiabatic h - resonance , the average @xmath19 energy is very different from the expected one without the neutrino oscillations .",
    "therefore , combined with theoretical evaluation of the average @xmath19 and @xmath25 energies emitted from proto - neutron stars , the effect of the neutrino oscillations will be studied and the neutrino oscillation parameters will be constrained .",
    "we have these three different procedures to constrain neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "first , the investigation of the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis in supernovae would provide a piece of evidence for normal mass hierarchy and adiabatic h - resonance .",
    "second , dsnb measurement with improved neutrino detector would reveal a possible proof of inverted mass hierarchy and adiabatic h - resonance .",
    "third , improved cosmological observations would clarify mass hierarchy .",
    "thus , combining the three investigations with each other , we hope to constrain strictly the neutrino oscillation parameters in the future .",
    "we studied light element nucleosynthesis through the @xmath0-process in supernovae taking account of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the parameters of neutrino oscillations were adopted from the evaluations through several neutrino experiments .",
    "we used a supernova model corresponding to sn 1987a and investigated the dependence of the @xmath1li and @xmath2b yields on the mixing angle @xmath5 and mass hierarchy .",
    "the obtained results are summarized as follows :    * neutrino oscillations affect the yields of @xmath1li and @xmath2b synthesized in supernova explosions .",
    "especially , the @xmath1li yield increases by a factor of 1.9 in the normal mass hierarchy and adiabatic h - resonance ( @xmath4 ) compared with that without neutrino oscillations . the @xmath2b yield increases by a factor of 1.3 .",
    "* in the inverted mass hierarchy , the increase in the @xmath1li and @xmath2b yields is smaller : the yields of @xmath1li and @xmath2b increase by factors of 1.3 and 1.2 .",
    "* neutrino oscillations in supernovae make the reaction rates of charged - current @xmath0-process reactions larger .",
    "the reaction rates of neutral - current @xmath0-process reactions do not change .",
    "thus , the final amounts of the @xmath0-process products increase by the neutrino oscillations . in our study , main important @xmath0-process reactions for the @xmath1li and @xmath2b production are @xmath14he(@xmath15h(@xmath126li , @xmath14he(@xmath16he(@xmath126be , @xmath51c(@xmath128b , and @xmath51c(@xmath129c .",
    "when we consider neutrino oscillations , the following charged - current @xmath0-process reactions become also important : @xmath14he(@xmath17he(@xmath126li , @xmath14he(@xmath18h ( @xmath126be , @xmath51c(@xmath64c , @xmath51c(@xmath66b .",
    "* the neutrino temperatures also affect the @xmath1li and @xmath2b yields due to neutrino oscillations",
    ". large difference of the temperatures of @xmath10 and @xmath13 brings about larger increase in the yields compared with those without neutrino oscillations . * the shock propagation effect on the neutrino oscillations would slightly reduce the increment of the @xmath1li and @xmath2b yields . in our model ,",
    "most of neutrinos pass through the he / c layer before the shock wave arrives at the o / c layer , i.e. , the resonance density region .",
    "when the shock wave is in the o - rich layers , the density change by the shock does not influence strongly neutrino oscillations .",
    "we would like to thank koichi iwamoto , kenichi nomoto , and toshikazu shigeyama for providing the data for the internal structure of progenitor model 14e1 and for helpful discussions .",
    "we are also indebted to yong - yeon keum and masahiro takada for their valuable discussions .",
