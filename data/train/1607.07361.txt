    "transition metal oxides are versatile compounds with a number of actual and potential applications because of their coupling between charge , spin , and lattice degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "titanium dioxide , tio@xmath0 , is a particular 3@xmath1 transition metal oxide of great interest because of its wide range of applications .",
    "this versatility is partly due to the many oxidation states of ti and the different structural polymorphs of titanium oxides . in nature",
    ", tio@xmath0 occurs in three different structural polymorphs at ambient conditions : rutile , anatase and brookite .",
    "rutile is the most abundant and is widely used as a white pigment , opacifier and ultraviolet radiation absorber , while anatase is the most photocatalytically active polymorph.@xcite numerous other phases have been identified or predicted , particularly at high pressure@xcite .",
    "nanocrystalline mixtures of anatase and rutile tio@xmath0 are used in dye - sensitized solar cells and water splitting for hydrogen fuel production.@xcite brookite is also a good photocatalyst although it is more difficult to mine or synthesize than rutile or anatase @xcite .",
    "because the functionality and applications of tio@xmath0 depends on the structural polymorph , accurate characterization of the phase stability of the tio@xmath0 polymorphs is critical .",
    "the most basic questions that need to be answered are which is the most stable of the three natural polymorphs , and what are the energy differences between them .",
    "the majority of experimental studies that have addressed these questions have concluded that the bulk crystalline transition from anatase or brookite to rutile is irreversible , so that anatase and brookite are metastable.@xcite however , it is very challenging to accurately measure the subtle enthalpy differences between these phases . for example , the measured difference between rutile and anatase ranges from 0.158 to 2.50  mha per tio@xmath0 formula unit ( f.u.)@xcite , while the janaf tables give 2.3@xmath20.5  mha / f.u.@xcite . for nanoscale and potentially hydrated samples , there are phase stability reversals due to the importance of surface contributions and relative variation in surface energies@xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions based on density functional theory ( dft)@xcite do not give consistent results , and are often in disagreement with experimental results on the energetic ordering of the rutile , anatase , and brookite polymorphs .",
    "conventional dft based on the local - density approximation ( lda ) as well as many generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) functionals give the result that anatase is the lowest - energy phase@xcite , and that brookite has lower energy than rutile@xcite .",
    "this is clearly in disagreement with experiments .",
    "lda or gga functionals are typically inadequate to describe transition metal oxides because of the self - interaction error and strong electronic correlations in them .",
    "specifically , lda or gga unphysically delocalize the 3@xmath1 electrons of titanium atoms . to account for electronic correlations , methods beyond lda or gga",
    "have been used .",
    "dft+@xmath3 methods can obtain the correct energetic ordering between rutile , anatase and brookite phases by tuning the @xmath3-parameter@xcite .",
    "however , optimizing the @xmath3-parameter for one physical property can result in less accurate values for other physical properties .",
    "most importantly , by its nature this approach is not predictive .",
    "hybrid functionals with exact hartree - fock exchange ( exx ) often improve the accuracy of semi local dfts . given the generally improved thermodynamic properties of materials when calculated with hybrid functionals , it is notable that standard hybrids with typical ( 25% ) fractions of exact exchange do not reproduce the experimental ordering .",
    "indeed , a hartree - fock fraction of over 70% is needed to reproduce the experimental ordering@xcite . in a recent study using a non - self - consistent random - phase approximation with exx",
    ", it was found that rutile is more stable than anatase.@xcite the poor description of dispersion interactions afforded by dft has also been considered to be a reason for the disagreement of the energetic ordering between lda / gga methods and experiments , and calculations using dispersive interactions within the dft+d method were performed.@xcite however , this type of method also introduces empiricism .    further clouding comparisons between calculations and experiments",
    "is the consideration that dft - based calculations are usually done at 0  k. because of the small experimental enthalpy differences between the tio@xmath0 phases , it is reasonable to expect that finite - temperature effects may play an important role and may further complicate theoretical determination of the relative stability of tio@xmath0 phases . in order to correctly and reliably treat these small energy differences , theoretical predictions",
    "must be based on methods that are more accurate than dft - based ones , and preferably be based on methods that provide avenues for systematic improvements .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods , particularly fixed - node",
    "diffusion monte carlo ( fn - dmc)@xcite , offer such capability .",
    "fn - dmc has been successfully applied to a wide range of molecules@xcite and solids@xcite .",
    "studies of transition metal oxides using the fn - dmc method , including ti@xmath4o@xmath5@xcite , vo@xmath0@xcite , mno@xcite , feo@xcite , cuprates@xcite , nio@xcite , zno@xcite , have demonstrated its outstanding capability of characterizing strong electron correlation in solids .",
    "recent works have also demonstrated the accuracy of fn - dmc when dealing with systems dominated by dispersion interactions.@xcite .",
    "moreover , the cost to calculate the energy per atom with qmc scales as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of electrons , and thus allows application to much larger systems than other correlated or many - body methods , such as configuration interaction ( ci ) and coupled cluster ( cc ) . because it is a monte carlo method , the fn - dmc algorithm can be easily parallelized and efficiently uses hundreds of thousands of processors , including both cpus and gpus@xcite . in brief ,",
    "fn - dmc is a very promising empirical parameter - free method for simulating materials accurately and efficiently using supercomputers .    in this work ,",
    "we first study the phase stability of rutile , anatase and brookite polymorphs at zero temperature using the highly accurate fn - dmc .",
    "we determine the energetic ordering after considering all sources of systematic errors , which can potentially contaminate the high accuracy required in order to unambiguously determine the subtle energy difference between these different phases .",
    "we find anatase to be the most stable polymorph at 0  k , but we find the energy difference between anatase and rutile only to be 1.5  mha per formula unit ( f.u . ) with a statistical uncertainty of 0.1  mha / f.u . , while rutile and brookite have the same energy within statistical errors in the absence of zero point motion . in order to account for finite temperature and to determine the phase stability of the polymorphs at finite temperatures",
    ", we also study the phonon contributions to the phase stability of all the three polymorphs at finite temperatures using density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt)@xcite .",
    "temperature has a profound effect on the phase stability , producing a different ordering than at zero temperature .",
    "taking phonon contributions into account , we find that the free energy of rutile becomes lower than that of anatase at 650@xmath8  k. this is consistent with the experimental observations that rutile can easily be synthesized from anatase by keeping it at above 870  k for a few minutes up to a day or at 663  k after one week.@xcite we also find that the free energy of brookite is higher than that of rutile and anatase at all finite temperatures .",
    "the qmc calculations reported here are carried out within the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) and fn - dmc frameworks implemented in the qmcpack code,@xcite with a slater - jastrow type trial wave function .",
    "the single - particle orbitals used to construct the slater determinants are extracted from lda+@xmath3@xcite calculations obtained from the quantum espresso@xcite electronic structure code .",
    "the plane - wave cutoff in dft / lda calculations was 150 ha which is much higher than conventional dft calculations because of the hard pseudopotentials we use here .",
    "total energies were converged to 0.01  mha / f.u .  with respect to this cutoff .",
    "the monkhorst - pack meshes of @xmath9-points are @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 for rutile , anatase and brookite primitive cells respectively .",
    "total energies were converged to 0.0005  mha / f.u .  with these k - point samplings .",
    "the hubbard @xmath3 parameter is chosen variationally by fn - dmc@xcite ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : lda+u ] ) , which provides an un - biased way of determining this parameter . note that this method does not guarantee that dft+@xmath3 calculations with this value of @xmath3 will yield any better agreement with experiments than other methods@xcite .",
    "this method instead is a limited way to optimize the nodal surface of the fn - dmc wave function . within qmcpack ,",
    "the orbitals are evaluated on a real space mesh using b - splines to achieve a constant - time per orbital evaluation of the orbitals independent of the basis set size .",
    "the jastrow part of the trial wave function contains both one- and two - body jastrow factors with a total of 40 parameters optimized by energy minimization @xcite within vmc .",
    "the one - body jastrow has a cutoff radius as large as the wigner - seitz ( ws ) radius of a 16  f.u .",
    "cell , listed in table  [ tab : cellspec ] .",
    "the two - body jastrow cutoff is the same as the ws radius of the supercell . to test the sensitivity of the dmc energy to the jastrow factor",
    ", we also used a three - body jastrow factor to capture additional ion - electron - electron correlations ; this calculation was however limited to 36  f.u .",
    "supercells because of its higher computational expense .",
    "the three - body jastrow factor lowers the final dmc energies , but the energy difference between rutile and anatase remains consistent with the calculation with only one and two body jastrow factors , 2.2(3 ) vs 2.5(3 )  mha , see table  [ tab : j3 ] .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      while our dmc calculations help to establish the energy ordering of the rutile and anatase phases at 0  k ( neglecting zero point energy ) , our results are in disagreement with experimental observations at finite temperature@xcite in which rutile is the most stable phase .",
    "we therefore investigate the role of lattice vibrations at finite temperature on the phase stability to see if the ordering is influenced more by the entropy than the electronic contribution to the free energy at finite temperatures .",

    "the internal energy is calculated as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dft internal energy , amended by adding the energy difference between fn - dmc and dft on the experimental structure .",
    "in general this energy correction should be volume dependent , but this approximation is accurate for the very small volume range considered here .",
    "the zero - point and thermal contribution terms are obtained using density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) as implemented in the phonon code of the quantum espresso package@xcite .",
    "the accuracy of dft is sufficient for computing the inter - atomic force constants ( ifc ) used by phonon calculations because the phonon dispersion relations of rutile calculated by dft and measured by inelastic neutron scattering are in a good agreement@xcite .    for these calculations we utilize gbrv ultra - soft lda pseudopotentials@xcite and 40  ha kinetic energy cutoff for lower computational cost without compromising accuracy .",
    "calculations with pp - gbrv and our much harder pp - qmc ( generated by dft / lda ) indicate the consistency of pseudopotentials in dft and qmc calculations by showing no difference in the phonon dispersion relation and zero - point energy .",
    "dfpt calculations with helmholtz free energy converged to 0.05  mha / f.u .",
    "are obtained with @xmath9- and @xmath21-point meshes of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for rutile , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for anatase , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 for brookite .",
    "the final phonon density of states is recalculated from the ifc on a much denser @xmath21-mesh , @xmath28 .",
    "to apply the qha , phonon calculations are performed on eight volumes for each solid with the shape of cell and atomic positions fully relaxed .",
    "note that for rutile , given the instability caused by the soft modes in large expansion@xcite , free energy values at large expansion are extrapolated .",
    "the fact that these dft - predicted soft phonon modes have been confirmed by inelastic x - ray scattering@xcite strengthens the credibility of dft phonon calculations in these materials .",
    "the zero point energy ( zpe ) values of rutile , anatase and brookite are listed in table  [ tab : final ] , and the helmholtz free energy as a function of temperature are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice_dynamics ] . at zero temperature",
    ", anatase remains the most stable phase even though the larger zpe of anatase reduces the energy difference between anatase and rutile , but it is not enough to change the energetic ordering qualitatively .",
    "because of a larger zpe , brookite becomes less stable than rutile , which is consistent with the experimental findings .",
    "as the temperature is increased , the helmholtz energy of rutile decreases much faster than that of anatase , and above @xmath29  k , rutile becomes the most stable phase .",
    "this phase transition is consistent with many experimental observations@xcite that rutile can be very easily synthesized by heating anatase above about 870  k. it was also reported that at 663  k , rutile became detectable in anatase powder after one week.@xcite in all temperatures up to the melting point , brookite remains less stable than rutile and anatase .",
    "150  k. the error bars indicate the statistical uncertainty due to the qmc data used for the 0  k energy differences . ]",
    "we would like to emphasize that the qmc correction for the internal energy is crucial to improve the theoretical prediction of the phase stability between rutile and brookite , although it does not change the relative stability of anatase and rutile compared to pure dfpt .",
    "this experience clearly shows that a specific density functional may work well in a few cases but is not guaranteed to work all the time .",
    "thus methods like qmc offering higher reliability and predictability are desired .",
    "we have studied the phase stability of rutile , anatase and brookite polymorphs of tio@xmath0 at 0  k using highly accurate fn - dmc calculations .",
    "we also calculated the helmholtz free energy of the polymorphs at finite temperature by including a dfpt based quasi - harmonic treatment of the phonon contributions .",
    "our results show that at zero temperature , anatase is the most stable phase , while brookite is less stable than rutile when zero - point energy is included . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the free energy of rutile decreases faster than that of anatase , and rutile becomes the most stable bulk phase at temperatures above about 650  k. the effect of lattice vibrations at finite temperature is therefore crucial to the bulk phase stability of all the phases .",
    "the largest potential source of errors in our qmc calculations are the time step and finite size errors .",
    "we have demonstrated that these are well converged , and our results are not sensitive to them .",
    "there are two sources of systematic error remaining in the zero - temperature qmc calculations that prevents them from being exact .",
    "first , our calculations are subject to the fermion sign problem and the fixed - node error that results from using fn - dmc to control it",
    ". ideally the nodal structure of the trial wave functions would be fully optimized in qmc .",
    "this is becoming feasible for single slater determinant wave functions in simple solids@xcite , but more flexible many - body trial wave functions are also desirable .",
    "today , we can not rigorously determine the relative nodal error between the tio@xmath0 phases , although we believe it to be small .",
    "second , because we utilize pseudopotentials we must be concerned with the fundamental accuracy of the pseudopotential construction and the locality errors that result when evaluated in qmc .",
    "we expect considerable error cancellation because all of the polymorphs have , by definition , exactly the same composition .",
    "the locality error can be reduced by more accurate trial wave functions , and the atom - specific nature of the locality error suggests that this error may be targeted using methods inspired by quantum chemistry .",
    "finally , the results for finite temperatures would presumably be more accurate if qmc methods could be used for the lattice dynamics ; however , this is at the present not possible . in the future ,",
    "improvements to those remaining systematic error should be achievable when greater computational resources and improved methods are available .",
    "this would enable increased confidence in our results .",
    "these improvements are desirable for all qmc calculations and are not restricted to the current investigation .    in summary ,",
    "our calculations indicate a potential resolution of the long - standing problem in reconciling dft - based calculations with experimental observations .",
    "the fact that our qmc and many conventional density functional results obtain anatase as the most stable phase at 0  k suggests that these functionals might be qualitatively correct in giving the energetic ordering between anatase and rutile : it should not be automatically assumed that these calculations are in error , and we caution against using prediction of rutile as most stable at 0  k to validate new electronic structure methods .",
    "our finite temperature calculations show that the lattice - dynamical contribution is important and should be taken into consideration when comparing with experimental data .",
