    "in anticipation of the new observational window afforded by interferometric gravitational - wave observatories now under construction , there has been considerable interest in the rates of formation and merger of binary systems containing at least one neutron star . for double neutron - star ( ns - ns ) systems , estimates of these rates depend on the assumed `` detectable lifetimes '' of the radio pulsars in known close ns - ns binaries .",
    "the detectable lifetime of a known ns - ns binary is , presumably , the sum of the post - accretion age of the observed radio pulsar and the remaining timespan during which it will continue to be observable . for the latter ,",
    "some past authors have used the time to coalescence of the system , while others have argued that luminosity evolution limits the detectable lifetime . for age estimates , past",
    "work has relied exclusively on the `` characteristic '' spin - down timescale @xmath9 , but @xmath10 is an accurate chronological age only if the present - day spin period @xmath6 is much greater than the pulsar s period @xmath11 at `` birth '' ( i.e. , at the end of the accretion phase for recycled pulsars ) , and for dipolar radiation braking with a constant magnetic field .",
    "since @xmath11 may not be small compared to @xmath6 , the spindown timescale is generally an overestimate of the time since spinup ; consequently , birth and merger rates for ns - ns systems based on @xmath10 may be underestimates .",
    "we argue that a neutron star s rotational history since the cessation of spin - up may be used to better estimate its true age . for each known system , we check such age estimates against kinematic constraints derived from motion in the galactic gravitational potential ( sections  2 and 3 ) . in section  [ br.sec ] , we use our results to estimate the detectable lifetimes , and hence birthrates , of the known ns - ns binaries , revisiting the assumptions underlying earlier work .",
    "in addition , we show that there are kinematic solutions for both b1534 + 12 and b1913 + 16 for which they are young ( ages @xmath12 myr ) ; we describe how these ages , if characteristic of binary neutron stars , might alter estimates of their birth and merger rates .",
    "finally , we show in section  [ accret.sec ] that the phenomena of spiral - in and merger of ns - ns systems are reflected in the @xmath6-@xmath7 diagram , and argue that details of the spin - up process for other binary pulsars similarly leave behind important imprints .",
    "through accretion of mass and angular momentum from an evolving companion star , a neutron star can be spun up to an equilibrium period approximated by the kepler orbital period at the alfvn radius ( ghosh & lamb 1992 ) , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the neutron star s magnetic moment expressed in units of @xmath15 g@xmath16 , @xmath17 is the opacity of the accreting material in units of 0.4 @xmath18g@xmath1 ( the thomson opacity for ionized hydrogen ) , @xmath19 is the stellar radius in units of @xmath20 cm , @xmath21 is the neutron star s mass in units of 1.4 @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the mass accretion rate in units of the eddington rate ( accretion onto a sphere is assumed ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 is of order unity , where @xmath25 encapsulates uncertainty in the alfvn radius and @xmath26 is the fastness parameter . in the magnetic dipole model , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the stellar moment of inertia and @xmath29 is a geometrical factor , which then implies the `` spin - up line '' relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the endpoint of spin - up by accretion , @xmath30 where @xmath6 is in seconds , and @xmath31 g@xmath18 .",
    "= -1    while the scaling @xmath32 in equation  ( [ peqline.eq ] ) is well - founded for neutron stars with predominantly dipolar magnetic fields , there are numerous sources of uncertainty in the coefficient @xmath33 : the parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are not well known , and sub - eddington accretion , @xmath37 , is likely ( e.g. , if inflow onto the neutron star is restricted to the polar caps ) . also , the preferred spin - up scenario for ns - ns systems , accretion from the helium core of a companion stripped of its hydrogen envelope , suggests an opacity @xmath38 .",
    "we adopt a `` fiducial '' spin - up relation with coefficient @xmath39  s@xmath40 and perform calculations for a range of values .",
    "if the evolutionary timescale of the donor star is short , the accretion phase may not last long enough to spin the neutron star up to equilibrium .",
    "the time to reach equilibrium is @xmath41 ; if mass accretion lasts a time @xmath42 yr @xmath43 , the spin period at the end of the accretion phase is @xmath44 , which implies the relationship @xmath45 where we have used @xmath46 ms .",
    "equation  ( [ p-8.eq ] ) is extremely sensitive to all of the parameters , and represents a family of @xmath47 spin - up lines in the @xmath6-@xmath7 diagram ; the line for @xmath48 and @xmath49 yr is plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "the intersection of this alternate spin - up line with the equilibrium @xmath50 line defines a minimum post - accretion period ( corresponding to @xmath51 ) that depends on the total mass accreted , but is insensitive to other parameters ( see also kulkarni & phinney 1994 ) . if we include the effects of accretion - induced field decay following shibazaki  ( 1989 ) , we find no qualitative change in the form of the non - equilibrium spin - up line .      the time to spin down from birth period @xmath11 to present - day period @xmath6 , with constant braking index @xmath52 , is @xmath53,\\ ] ] where the characteristic age @xmath54 $ ] approaches the true age only in the limit @xmath55 . in the @xmath6-@xmath7 diagram ,",
    "intersection of the spin - down trajectory @xmath56 with an assumed spin - up line provides a recycled pulsar s initial period which , through equation  ( [ age.eq ] ) yields the epoch since the end of spin - up .",
    "we apply this technique to estimate the ages of the known ns - ns systems ; should accretion in a given system have halted before the equilibrium spin period was reached , or if the accretion rate was sub - eddington , such an estimate becomes a strong upper bound on the true age . for the fiducial spin - up line and @xmath57 , spin - down trajectories for the known ns - ns systems are shown in fig .  1 , the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane for recycled pulsars .",
    "the validity of post - accretion spin - down ages may be questioned if there is no single spin - up line as given by equation  ( [ peqline.eq ] ) .",
    "evidence that accretion consistent with equation  ( [ peqline.eq ] ) is responsible for b1913 + 16-like systems ( see section  [ accret.sec ] ) is provided by examination of the @xmath6-@xmath7 diagram : all three of the known systems lie near the spin - up line .",
    "the pulsars in these binaries must have originated above and to the left of their present positions in this diagram , and in any case age estimates become increasingly insensitive to large values of the coefficient @xmath33 ( cf .",
    "fig .  2 ) .",
    "more importantly , @xmath33 can not be made arbitrarily big , as there are no known recycled pulsars above the spin - up line , excepting two pulsars in globular clusters ( section  [ rega.sec ] ) .",
    "we therefore adopt the value @xmath58",
    "s@xmath40 as a reasonable maximum to constrain ages at the upper end .",
    "we compute spin - down ages for several values of the braking index , but for @xmath59 the slope of the spin - up line differs from @xmath50 in a way that is difficult to quantify without a model for the braking torque produced by the magnetic field .",
    "we have applied the model of melatos ( 1997 ) , which successfully explains the measured braking indices @xmath60 of three young pulsars as a result of their magnetospheric structure , to objects near the spin - up line , and find that they should have @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is initially very small and decreases further as objects spin down .",
    "this result supports age estimates derived for spin - up lines @xmath63 and spin - down with @xmath57 . if magnetic fields of recycled pulsars evolve on timescales comparable to @xmath64 , however , @xmath65 is possible ( for specific models , see e.g.  ruderman , zhu & chen 1998 ) ; in such models , the spin - down time is altered , but not necessarily the equilibrium spin - up relation .",
    "-1 a radio pulsar s distance @xmath66 from the galactic plane together with its velocity derived from proper motion measurements can be used to estimate its age through integration of the pulsar s trajectory in the galactic gravitational potential .",
    "sources of uncertainty in addition to measurement errors in distance and proper motion are the unknown line - of - sight velocities and non - zero @xmath66-heights at `` birth '' ( the end of the spin - up phase for recycled pulsars ) .",
    "we calculate gravitational restoring forces towards the disk at the present - day galactocentric radii of b1534 + 12 and b1913 + 16 using the potential of paczyski ( 1990 ) .",
    "useful kinematic age constraints can be derived for b1913 + 16 because it is at low galactic latitude and its distance and proper motion are well determined .",
    "kinematic and spin - down age estimates are compared in fig .",
    "2 . trajectories in the top panel are constrained to cross the system s current @xmath66-height moving upward at the correct present - day velocity @xmath67 ; they imply that the system is either leaving the galactic plane for the first time ( @xmath68 myr ) , or has completed at least one - half cycle of its oscillation in @xmath66 . in the latter case , i.e. , for ages greater than a few tens of myr , the system is likely to have sampled the galactic potential over a large range of galactocentric radii @xmath69 , so that the assumption of a constant @xmath69 breaks down  this will stretch or compress the plotted trajectories in a way that depends on the actual path taken by the system through the galaxy , which is unknown .",
    "the unknown line - of - sight velocity @xmath70 also modifies these trajectories , but at the system s low galactic latitude , @xmath71 , only a very large @xmath70 would be significant : to change @xmath67 by 10% , approximately the difference between tracks _ ( a ) _ and _ ( b ) _ in fig .  2 , requires @xmath72 km - s@xmath1 .    the characteristic age of b1913 + 16 , assuming a @xmath7 corrected for galactic acceleration ( damour & taylor 1991 ) , is @xmath73 myr , while the combined kinematic and spin - evolution constraints yield two possible solutions for the age : a young solution , @xmath74 myr , which is largely insensitive to uncertainties in the assumed distance , present - day @xmath67 , and braking index , and an old solution , 6080 myr , where the upper bound assumes @xmath57 and @xmath75 s@xmath40 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the old solutions provide an upper bound on the braking index , @xmath76 , unless @xmath33 is very large .",
    "the characteristic age of psr b1534 + 12 is 252 myr , assuming the acceleration correction for @xmath7 given by stairs et al .",
    "the pulsar s distance from the spin - up line ( fig .",
    "3 ) implies @xmath77 myr , for @xmath57 and @xmath78 s@xmath40 .",
    "the two estimates differ little because the condition @xmath55 is nearly met if the pulsar was born on the spin - up line .",
    "based only on proper motion and distance , psr b1534 + 12 appears to be moving _ toward _ the galactic plane with transverse velocity @xmath79 km - s@xmath1 from its current position at @xmath80 pc .",
    "because the system is at galactic latitude @xmath81 , a modest radial velocity could reverse the sign of this apparent motion . without more information about the present - day @xmath67 the system s kinematic history is largely unconstrained . we have nevertheless derived the relevant motion in the galactic potential under various assumptions . in general , the minimum @xmath67 required at birth for the system to just reach its present @xmath66-height from a starting point @xmath82  pc is @xmath83 km - s@xmath1 .",
    "if we constrain the age to be roughly 200 myr , allowed solutions span a range of initial velocities and maximum @xmath66-heights depending on the number of oscillation periods that have elapsed since the system s birth , but likely solutions require a birth @xmath67 between 100 and 200 km - s@xmath1 and @xmath84 of 2.04.5 kpc .",
    "notably , the solution in which the pulsar has completed just less than half of its oscillation cycle and is returning to the plane for the first time requires a birth velocity @xmath85 km - s@xmath1 and @xmath86 kpc , which seem unlikely .",
    "if the age is in fact as large as we believe , the system has probably crossed the plane more than once . on the other hand",
    ", the kinematic age can be made arbitrarily small if the radial velocity is assumed to be large and the system is leaving the plane for the first time : an age @xmath12 myr requires a @xmath67 at birth of 90 km - s@xmath1 and a present - day @xmath87 km - s@xmath1 .",
    "the characteristic age of b2127 + 11c is @xmath88 myr ; the apparent @xmath7 of this pulsar is likely contaminated by the system s unknown acceleration in the gravitational potential of m15 ( but phinney 1992 estimates the contamination to be at most 2% ) . although the evolutionary history of b2127 + 11c is murky , the pulsar s spin - down track in @xmath6 and @xmath7 probably originated somewhere near the conventional spin - up line",
    "we estimate the time since spin - up for this pulsar to be @xmath89 myr ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "for a given pulsar in a ns - ns binary , the birthrate of similar objects may be estimated , following phinney ( 1991 ) , using @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the total galactic volume in which ns - ns binaries are found , @xmath92 is the luminosity- and density - weighted volume that pulsar surveys have sampled for objects with identical orbital period , and @xmath93 is an appropriate source lifetime .",
    "the total birthrate follows by summing over objects , @xmath94 .",
    "a more rigorous treatment , based on a likelihood function , uses all information in pulsar surveys , including non - detections in much of the survey volume as well as detected pulsars .",
    "although the scarcity of known binary pulsars would frustrate any attempt to constrain meaningfully the many important parameters that characterize the galactic population of ns - ns binaries , we can nevertheless use the formalism to understand the proper interpretation of the parameters that enter into any birthrate estimate .",
    "we find that a maximum likelihood estimate for the binary neutron star birthrate @xmath95 is @xmath96 where the number of detected binary pulsars is @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the joint expectation value of the fraction of all existing binary pulsars detected times source lifetime , summed over surveys .",
    "the denominator involves an integral of the number density of binary pulsar systems ( normalized to one ) times their average lifetime convolved with observational selection functions that limit the spatial volume and range of lifetimes amenable to detection . at a more fundamental level ,",
    "the necessary integral involves physical distributions of the positions , center of mass speeds , orbital elements and luminosities of binary pulsars at birth , and also requires physical models for the evolution of these distributions along with detailed understanding of the phenomenological limitations of searches for such systems .",
    "ideally , the physical distributions involved in computing @xmath98 should be determined from the available data , but , since very few ns - ns binaries are known , we , like others before us , are forced to appeal to prior knowledge or theoretical expectations about the binary populations instead .",
    "moreover , we approximate the expectation value for each survey by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the fraction of all ns - ns binaries we expect to be observable , and @xmath101 is the detectable lifetime of such systems ( see , e.g. , van den heuvel & lorimer )",
    ". we can also approximate @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a measure of how representative the detected binary pulsars are of the overall galactic population .",
    "if the ns - ns binaries found so far are typical of the overall population then @xmath104 ; if not , then @xmath3 could be small ( e.g. , a substantial fraction of binary pulsars could have orbital periods short enough that detection is unlikely ; johnston & kulkarni 1991 , bloom , sigurdsson & pols 1998 ) . for @xmath105 ,",
    "we find a birthrate estimate from a single detected binary pulsar similar to phinney s ( 1991 ) @xmath106 , except that it is now clear that ( i ) there is an underlying assumption that the detected system is typical of the population and ( ii ) the appropriate lifetime to use is the expected time over which the pulsar should be detectable . finally , in the absence of detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution of ns - ns binaries , we shall approximate ( following the language of cordes & chernoff 1997 ) the `` detection volume '' @xmath92 by the `` sampled volume '' @xmath107 , which is the sensitivity - limited region searched by pulsar surveys .",
    "this approximation is conservative in that @xmath107 overestimates @xmath92 ( see below ) .",
    "apart from @xmath3 , a major uncertainty in any birthrate estimate is the value of @xmath101 .",
    "below , we estimate this parameter by computing the expected detectable lifetimes for b1913 + 16 and b1534 + 12 separately .",
    "how to translate these values into an estimate of @xmath101 is somewhat subjective , as it depends on one s prior notions of which , if either , of them is `` more typical . ''",
    "this subjectivity pervades previous estimates of @xmath95 as well as our own : _ all _ are proportional to nonrigorous estimates of @xmath108 . as should be evident from equation  ( [ eq : brest ] ) , evaluating @xmath95 as the sum of birthrate estimates for individual binary pulsar detections represents a particular choice for @xmath108 .    in a manner similar to phinney ( 1991 ) , the birth and merger rates of ns - ns systems have been estimated by narayan , piran & shemi ( 1991 ) and curran & lorimer ( 1995 ) under , effectively , different assumptions for @xmath91 and @xmath107 . in each case , the lifetimes of individual systems were taken to be the sum of the pulsar s characteristic age and the binary s coalescence time .",
    "curran & lorimer s ( 1995 ; hereafter cl95 ) estimate has twice been revised .",
    "van den heuvel & lorimer ( 1996 ; hereafter vl96 ) argued that the effective `` detectable lifetime '' ( rather than the full lifetime culminating in merger ) should be used in birthrate calculations ; they estimated radio luminosity decay timescales for each pulsar and proposed a merger rate nearly three times that of cl95 .",
    "stairs et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter sac+98 ) determined that the distance to psr b1534 + 12 is larger than previously believed , implying that @xmath107 had been underestimated by cl95 .",
    "their correction reduced van den heuvel & lorimer s ( 1996 ) estimate by a factor of 2.5 , bringing it effectively back to cl95 s value .",
    "these revisions are summarized in table 1 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath109this entry summarizes our estimate @xmath110 , equation  ( [ br1.eq ] ) , which is based on different assumptions for computing galactic scale factors than the first four entries ( see text ) .",
    "we first report here our own revision consistent with the methods and assumptions of cl95 .",
    "we then evaluate the assumptions entering into previous @xmath91 and @xmath107 calculations and report a birthrate reflecting recently completed radio pulsar surveys .      as argued by van den heuvel & lorimer ( 1996 ) , and as emphasized above , we need the detectable lifetime @xmath111 of the sources to estimate their birthrate .",
    "vl96 considered radio luminosity decay and showed that both b1534 + 12 and b1913 + 16 will likely become undetectable before they merge with their companions .",
    "however , detection is biased against finding recycled pulsars in short - period binaries ; in present surveys , neither pulsar might have been found if their binary periods were @xmath112 times their present values .",
    "the gravitational radiation lifetimes of b1534 + 12 and b1913 + 16 are @xmath113 yrs and @xmath114 yrs , respectively . for b1534 + 12",
    ", the orbital period will halve in about @xmath115 yrs and for b1913 + 16 , in about @xmath116 yrs . the latter result implies that the detectable lifetime of b1913 + 16 is limited by orbital selection rather than by luminosity decay .",
    "as shown in table 1 , then , our revision to cl95 s estimate consists of adopting ( 1 ) the stairs et al .",
    "( 1998 ) distance to b1534 + 12 , ( 2 ) our preferred age estimates for b1913 + 16 , 65 myr , and b1534 + 12 , 200 myr , and ( 3 ) retaining van den heuvel & lorimer s ( 1996 ) luminosity decay for b1534 + 12 , but assuming b1913 + 16 will remain detectable for 180 myr as a result of observational selection due to the rapidly decaying orbit determine the typical detectable lifetime . ] .",
    "we thus derive a birthrate , uncorrected for beaming or a luminosity function to account for dim objects , of @xmath117 yr@xmath1 by summing the individual rates of the two objects , a 23% increase over the latest revision .",
    "we note that cl95 suggest a factor of 10 increase to account for low - luminosity objects , and a further factor of three increase for beaming .",
    "values of @xmath91 used previously range from @xmath118900 kpc@xmath119 ; the lowest @xmath91 ( cl95 ) attributes a population i radial distribution and a scale height @xmath120 kpc to ns - ns binaries .",
    "the kinematic `` ages '' of binary pulsars are directly related to their scale heights .",
    "previously , a range @xmath1211 kpc has been used to estimate binary pulsar birthrates , but this does not typify the @xmath66 distribution of old ns which , for isolated pulsars , includes a large fraction that oscillate to @xmath122 kpc .",
    "we argue that the space velocities of ns - ns binaries are sufficently large ( up to @xmath123 km - s@xmath1 ) that both the radial and @xmath66 distributions should be extended , to roughly a 10 kpc characteristic radius and @xmath124 kpc .",
    "this yields @xmath125 kpc@xmath119 .",
    "estimates of @xmath107 are highly sensitive to modeling of selection effects in surveys that have or could have found the ns - ns binaries .",

    "( 1998 ) show that the luminosity function for non - recycled pulsars begins to turn over for @xmath146 mjykpc@xmath135 , but that there is no evidence for a turnover at 1  mjykpc@xmath135 for spun - up objects .",
    "using our estimates of @xmath91 and @xmath107 , and expressing @xmath101 in units of the mean of the detectable lifetimes of b1913 + 16 and b1534 + 12 , we obtain a rate @xmath147 where @xmath2 is the beaming fraction , under the assumption that these binaries are typical of the galactic population of ns - ns systems .",
    "this result is nearly a factor of 7 smaller than our revision of the cl95 estimate corrected for their suggested factor of 10 contribution from low - luminosity objects , @xmath148 yr@xmath1 .",
    "we attribute this difference to the increased galactic volume recently surveyed for rapidly rotating pulsars as represented here by @xmath107 , and our inclusion of the radio luminosity function in estimating @xmath107 instead of the somewhat arbitrary multiplying factor of 10 of cl95 .    aside from the beaming factor @xmath2 , equation  ( [ br1.eq ] ) is a _ lower bound _ to the actual birthrate for three reasons .",
    "first , the birthrate function for binary neutron stars could be skewed toward short orbital periods ( bloom , sigurdsson & pols 1998 ) where detection becomes unlikely ( johnston & kulkarni 1991 ) . if this is true , then @xmath3 is small , and the birthrate is larger than @xmath149 by a factor of @xmath150 ( see eqs .  [",
    "[ eq : brest ] ] and [ [ eq : fest ] ] ) .",
    "second , @xmath107 overestimates @xmath92 : for high - sensitivity surveys such as those carried out at arecibo , sky coverage at high latitudes samples a large volume at @xmath66-heights beyond the likely scale height of ns - ns binaries .",
    "third , the parameters entering into our estimate of @xmath107 , equation  ( [ vmax.eq ] ) , are sufficiently uncertain that the sampled volume itself is likely overestimated .",
    "we have probably overestimated @xmath101 as well . taken together , these considerations suggest that @xmath149 may underestimate the true rate by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "previous estimates of the binary pulsar birthrate , including our @xmath149 , presume that their lifetimes are limited by either spiral - in or spin - down .",
    "ideally , one should dispose with this prior assumption and determine @xmath101 from the data , if possible .",
    "we note that kinematical considerations imply that b1913 + 16 may be @xmath12 myr old , and a similarly young age can not be ruled out for b1534 + 12 .",
    "if a significant fraction of recycled pulsars discovered in future surveys prove to be young ( age @xmath12 myr ) , but in binary systems with long gravitational radiation and spindown lifetimes ( @xmath1181000 myr ) , then we would be forced to reduce our estimate of the detectable lifetime @xmath93 .",
    "( this would also imply that something other than gravitational radiation or spindown regulates the timescale over which binary pulsars are observable . )",
    "such a short lifetime would require a large birthrate , @xmath151 yr@xmath1 , for such systems , which could dominate the rate of neutron star mergers if they are common .",
    "as long as there is not a statistically significant population of anomalously young binary pulsars , this large birthrate is not required .",
    "given that only a few pulsars are known to exist in tight binaries , however , we can not rule out the existence of short - lived binary pulsars that are born frequently .    both of our birthrate estimates @xmath149 and @xmath152 can easily take on values larger than @xmath153 yr@xmath1 when provision is made for beaming and the large uncertainties in @xmath91 , @xmath107 , and @xmath92 .",
    "this possibility prompts us to re - examine the upper bound of @xmath154 yr@xmath1 proposed by bailes ( 1996 ) based on the absence of any known `` normal '' ( i.e. , non - recycled , long - period , high magnetic - field ) pulsars in a close ns - ns binary .",
    "we begin by defining the following quantities :    * @xmath95 , the birthrate of ns - ns binaries that will merge in a hubble time , * @xmath155 , the detectable lifetime of the non - recycled neutron star in such a binary , * @xmath156 , the fraction surveyed to date of the galactic volume occupied by such binaries ( @xmath157 ) , * @xmath158 , the fraction of such binaries that are detectable despite orbital smearing of the _ non - recycled _",

    "similarly , for the normal , isolated pulsar population , n_n t_n f_vn f_b = n_n . taking the ratio , and assuming @xmath163 , we get [ bailes.eq ] n < ( ) n_n .",
    "the quantity in parentheses , which was not considered by bailes ( 1996 ) explicitly , can be less than or greater than one , but is probably close to unity .",
    "we believe the scale height of binaries is somewhat smaller than that of the isolated normal pulsars , so @xmath164 is likely ( i.e. , a larger fraction of the galactic volume of binaries has been searched ) . because of orbital acceleration , @xmath158 is less than one , but represents a less severe selection effect for slow pulsars than for recycled objects .",
    "bailes ( 1996 ) assumed @xmath165 , and adopted the largest allowed birthrate , @xmath166 yr@xmath1 , from the analysis by lorimer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) of the population of normal , isolated pulsars .",
    "a similar recent effort by lyne et al .  ( 1998 ) based on a larger sample of objects finds a maximum birthrate of one every 60 yrs .",
    "furthermore , the number of cataloged normal pulsars with measured spin - down rates , i.e. , for which non - membership in a ns - ns binary has been firmly established , is 501 . assuming unity for the factor in parentheses in equation  ( [ bailes.eq ] ) , an upper bound on the birthrate of close ns - ns binaries is then @xmath167 yr@xmath1 , independent of beaming .",
    "this rate should be corrected upward by a statistical `` poisson '' factor and by the factor @xmath158 ; we therefore believe that a robust upper limit is n < 10 ^ -4yr^-1 .",
    "we point out , however , that the rate @xmath152 need not be subject to this bound , as the assumption @xmath163 might not hold if the detectable lifetimes of ns - ns binaries were somehow not governed by the spin - down or gravitational radiation timescales .    finally , we refer , for completeness , to the recent work of rosswog et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who find that a ns - ns merger rate of @xmath168@xmath169 yr@xmath1 could acount for the apparent deficit of @xmath170-process nuclei .",
    "surveys over the last 16 years have been sensitive to objects with @xmath171 ms to varying degrees .",
    "certain portions of the @xmath6-@xmath7 diagram have become populated as a result , while others have remained empty .",
    "we argue that three of these unpopulated regions , labelled , , and  in fig .  1 ,",
    "provide insights into the evolution of binary systems containing neutron stars .",
    "in particular , there is a dearth of pulsars in region   where we would expect to find inspiralling ns - ns binaries .",
    "we assess the significance of this and other deficits below .",
    "there are no known selection effects to prevent detection of pulsars in region : objects with spin - down rates higher than the low - field millisecond pulsars would likely be brighter and so more easily detectable .",
    "still , no recycled pulsars in the galactic disk are known above the spin - up line .",
    "we interpret this as a qualitative validation of the ghosh - lamb spin - up line .",
    "we discount pulsars in globular clusters , here and in the discussions to follow , because of their uncertain spin - down rates and complicated evolutionary histories .",
    "region  is below and to the right of the known ns - ns systems , for @xmath172 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "a deficit of known pulsars here can occur for three reasons , all of which likely play some role :    1 .",
    "ns - ns binaries born near the spin - up line will coalesce before reaching region . in fig .  1",
    ", the spin - down tracks plotted for the three ns - ns systems end at lower right at the expected coalescence time for each system .",
    "only b1534 + 12 penetrates into region  before merging .",
    "2 .   for systems like b1534 + 12",
    ", inspiral results in short orbital periods , and high orbital velocities , within region , and such pulsars have been selected against .",
    "3 .   as the pulsars in these systems age ,",
    "their radio luminosities probably decay , making them more difficult to detect ( van den heuvel & lorimer 1996 ) .",
    "evidently , any systems in  are selected against in pulsar surveys , or few live long enough to reach or spend sufficient time in the region .",
    "apparently , no new systems like b1913 + 16 are being formed far from the spin - up line .",
    "the other known pulsars in the vicinity of region  are consistent with this hypothesis . the 0.8 @xmath22 white - dwarf companion to psr b0655 + 64 , the `` failed ns - ns '' system , has cooling age @xmath173 gyr ( hansen & phinney 1998 ) , which suggests the pulsar emerged from the accretion phase near the spin - up line with @xmath174 ms . also , j2235 + 1506 and two objects with @xmath175 ms are solitary and so",
    "could not have escaped detection through merger or orbital acceleration .",
    "the suggestion of camilo , nice & taylor ( 1993 ) that j2235 + 1506 is the result of a disrupted binary is consistent with this view .",
    "the deficit of pulsars in region  supports our use of the spin - up line as a zero - age starting point , and is consistent with the existence of a population of ns - ns systems with periods shorter than 8 hours which has remained undetected because of sensitivity limits and observational selection against binary pulsars with short orbital periods and massive companions .",
    "pulsars should already be known in region , periods 530 ms and @xmath176 s - s@xmath1 , where they would have spin - down luminosities 1.52 orders of magnitude higher than , say , j0621 + 1002 .",
    "we assert that the evolutionary path for producing radio pulsars in region  is disallowed or rarely followed .",
    "a clue to the absence of pulsars in  may lie in the apparent bimodality in the spin parameters of the massive binaries ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the `` b1913 '' family ( b1913 + 16 , b1534 + 12 , b2127 + 11c , and b0655 + 64 ) consists of pulsars in short - period orbits with ns ( or white - dwarf ) companions ; the pulsars had @xmath177 ms at the end of the spin - up phase .",
    "the `` j0621 '' family ( j0621 + 1002 , j1518 + 4904 , j2145@xmath1780750 , and j1022 + 1001 ) consists of pulsars in @xmath179-day orbits with massive white - dwarf ( or ns ) companions . the division between the two families is strikingly clean  the systems with discrepant companion types ( b0655 + 64 and j1518 + 4904 ) nonetheless have orbital periods consistent with their respective family members .",
    "the shorter average spin period of the j0621 family implies that spin - up in the wide - orbit systems must have been at least as effective as in the close ns - ns binaries , but produced final magnetic fields smaller by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "these facts suggest that different accretion and spin - up processes were responsible : we believe that the b1913 family was spun up through disk accretion and the j0621 family predominantly during a wind - driven accretion phase ( e.g. , van den heuvel 1994 presents a spin - up scenario for j2145@xmath1780750 involving wind accretion ) .",
    "it is generally believed that disk accretion drives monotonic spin - up ( until the spin period @xmath180 ) once the donor star overflows its roche lobe , whereas wind accretion produces a non - monotonic random walk in the angular momentum imparted to the ns . to achieve the same final spin period ,",
    "then , much more mass must be transferred , at lower accretion rates , in wind accretion , resulting in smaller magnetic fields for the wide - orbit binaries ; this is consistent with viable models of field attenuation during accretion ( konar & bhattacharya 1998 ) .",
    "( wijers 1998 refutes the hypothesis that field loss scales with accreted mass , but without considering non - monotonic spinup . )",
    "although recent observations show that disk accretion is also not entirely monotonic ( bildsten  1997 ; nelson 1997 ) , and certain numerical simulations of wind accretion question the existence of angular momentum `` flip - flops '' ( e.g. , font & ibanez 1998 ) , frequent or deep torque reversals during spin - up in wide binaries can account for the two distinct families of massive binary pulsars without the need for abandoning field decay that scales with accreted mass .",
    "given the proximity of region  to the spin - up line and the implied high magnetic fields relative to j0621 + 1002 , our arguments suggest that the missing ns undergo accretion in close systems .",
    "we speculate , then , that the initial conditions ( orbital separation and companion type ) needed to produce pulsars in region  lead instead to accretion ending with collapse of the ns to a black hole or merger with its companion in a common - envelope phase . in detail , the outcome would depend on the maximum mass of neutron stars and the efficiency of the accretion ( see , e.g. , brown 1995 and fryer , benz , & herant 1996 ) .    detecting pulsars in region",
    "should also be made difficult by the same pulse - smearing effects that would prevent detection of pulsars like b1913 + 16 in binary orbits with periods smaller than about four hours ( johnston & kulkarni 1991 ; section 4 above ) .",
    "the minimum detectable spin period for a given orbital period is @xmath181 , so it is unlikely that pulsars spinning faster than @xmath182 ms could be detected in binaries with @xmath183 hrs .",
    "conversely , pulsars with @xmath182 ms could only be found in binaries with orbital periods longer than about 8 hours .",
    "this means that recycled pulsars in binaries like those that contain b1534 + 12 , b1913 + 16 , and b2127 + 11c could remain undiscovered throughout region .",
    "moreover , the absence of pulsars in somewhat longer period binaries ( e.g. @xmath1841 day ) in region  suggests that there is a fairly sharp upper cutoff to the distribution of periods of close binary pulsar systems , the extended b1913 family .",
    "this supports the idea that the much longer period binaries in the j0621 family have a completely different physical origin .",
    "the explanation commonly put forth for millisecond pulsars with @xmath10 exceeding a hubble time is that these objects were born with spin periods close to their present values : spin - up endpoints are assumed to adhere to equation  ( [ peqline.eq ] ) , but with very low accretion rates , @xmath185 ( e.g. , hansen & phinney 1998 ) .",
    "we suggest two additional ways in which spin - up endpoints far from the canonical spin - up line may be produced : ( 1 ) for short - period binaries ( @xmath186 d ) , pulsars emerge on one of the @xmath187 spin - up lines if accretion ceases before the equilibrium period is reached ; and ( 2 ) for long - period binaries , wind accretion results in low - field radio pulsars with as yet undetermined initial periods .",
    "the ages of such systems are therefore uncertain .",
    "it would seem that near - eddington disk accretion given sufficient time to reach equilibrium rotation and ending in a pulsar is rare , as is indicated by the paucity of radio pulsars near the spin - up line for @xmath188  ms .",
    "in addition , if prolonged mass transfer with minimal spin - up during the wind accretion phase is an important part of the evolution of wide - orbit millisecond pulsars , as we suggest , the masses of these objects may be considerably higher than previously believed .",
    "future high - precision mass measurements for such systems may therefore provide important constraints on the maximum allowed neutron star mass .",
    "by estimating the detectable lifetimes of psrs b1534 + 12 and b1913 + 16 , we have revised previous estimates of the galactic birthrate of close double neutron star binaries . in steady state , this would also be the coalescence rate for these relatively short - lived binaries .",
    "we find , adopting the galactic `` scale factors '' of curran & lorimer ( 1995 ) , that the birthrate of such systems , uncorrected for a radio pulsar luminosity function and beaming , is @xmath189 yr@xmath1 . our own estimate of the birthrate , independent of curran & lorimer s ( 1995 ) methodology ,",
    "is based on a maximum likelihood analysis that clarifies the assumptions entering into all birthrate estimates , including our own .",
    "we find , given available knowledge of the ages , systemic velocities , and orbital properties of the two known close ns - ns systems in the galactic disk , along with an estimate of the galactic volume surveyed to date , that the birthrate ( and hence merger rate , for a steady - state distribution ) is @xmath190 yr@xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the beaming factor , and @xmath191 represents the degree to which the two known objects are typical of the entire population of ns - ns binaries .",
    "important parameters entering into this estimate , e.g. , the lower cutoff of the luminosity function for recycled pulsars , are sufficiently uncertain , however , that the true rate is probably higher by an order of magnitude or more ; we therefore consider our result to be a realistic lower bound on the true rate .",
    "furthermore , we find that kinematic and spin - down age constraints for psrs b1534 + 12 and b1913 + 16 allow both systems to be unexpectedly young  if we dispose of prior prejudices about the detectable lifetimes of these systems , their birthrates could be substantially higher , of order @xmath192 yr@xmath1 . we have revised the upper bound on the ns - ns binary birthrate proposed by bailes ( 1996 ) based on the absence of any known non - recycled pulsar in a ns - ns binary , finding that the potentially large birthrates allowed by our analysis are consistent with a revised upper bound at @xmath5 yr@xmath1 .",
    "we therefore bracket the merger rate of ns - ns binaries to the range @xmath0",
    "yr@xmath193 yr@xmath1 .    our considerations of @xmath194 for ns - ns binaries suggest that searches for such binaries out of the galactic plane will be more productive than those in the plane ; independent of how many are found , high - latitude searches will allow determination of the thickness of the population in @xmath66 ."
