    "there have been several successful tests of einstein s general theory of relativity in classical physics  @xcite .",
    "heisenberg and schroedinger , following bohr , formulated a quantum mechanics that has explained , in the standard model(sm )  @xcite , all established experimentally accessible quantum phenomena except the quantum treatment of einstein s theory . indeed , even with tremendous progress in quantum field theory , superstrings  @xcite , loop quantum gravity  @xcite , etc .",
    ", no satisfactory treatment of the quantum mechanics of einstein s theory is known to be correct phenomenologically . here , with an eye toward black hole physics , we apply a new approach  @xcite to quantum gravitational phenomena , building on previous work by feynman  @xcite to get a minimal union of bohr s and einstein s ideas . the approaches to the to the attendant bad uv behavior",
    "have been summarized in ref .",
    "our approach , based on yfs methods  @xcite , is a new version of the resummation approach  @xcite and allows us to make contact with both the extended theory  @xcite and the asymptotic safety  @xcite approaches and to discuss issues in black hole physics , some of which relate to hawking  @xcite radiation .",
    "in the sm there are many massive point particles .",
    "are they black holes in our new approach to quantum gravity ? to study this question , we follow feynman , treat spin as an inessential complication  @xcite , and consider the simplest case for our question , that of gravity coupled to a `` free '' scalar field , a `` free '' physical higgs field , @xmath0 , with a rest mass @xmath1 believed to be less than @xmath2 gev and known to be greater than @xmath3 gev with a 95% cl  @xcite .",
    "the feynman rules for this theory were already worked - out by feynman  @xcite . on this view",
    ", quantum gravity is just another quantum field theory where the metric now has quantum fluctuations as well .",
    "for example , the one - loop corrections to the graviton propagator due to matter loops is just given by the diagrams in fig .",
    "we return to these graphs shortly .",
    "to yfs resum the propagators in the theory , in the yfs formula in eq.(5.16 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , we make the replacements described in refs .",
    "@xcite to go over from qed to qg and get the factor @xmath4 in numerator of each propagator in feynman s series  @xcite , with @xmath5 in the deep euclidean regime .",
    "if @xmath1 vanishes , using the usual @xmath6 normalization point we get @xmath7 . in both cases",
    "the respective resummed propagator falls faster than any power of @xmath8 !",
    "this means that one - loop corrections are finite !",
    "all quantum gravity loops are uv finite and the all orders proof is given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the one - loop corrections to newton s law implied by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] directly impact our black hole issue . using the yfs resummed propagators in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we get the potential  @xcite @xmath9 where  @xcite @xmath10 when for definiteness we set @xmath11gev .",
    "our gauge invariant analysis can be shown  @xcite to be consistent with the one - loop analysis of qg in ref .",
    "with reasonable estimates and measurements  @xcite of the sm particle masses , including the various bosons , the corresponding results for the analogs of the diagrams in fig .",
    "1 imply  @xcite that in the sm @xmath12 . to make direct contact with black hole physics , note that , if @xmath13 is the schwarzschild radius , for @xmath14 , @xmath15 so that @xmath16 .",
    "this means that @xmath17 remains positive as we pass through the schwarzschild radius .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that this positivity holds to @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , @xmath19 remains negative through @xmath13 down to @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "in resummed qg , a massive point particle is not a black hole .",
    "our results imply the running newton constant @xmath20 which is fixed point behavior for @xmath21 , in agreement with the phenomenological asymptotic safety approach of ref .",
    "our result that an elementary particle has no horizon also agrees with the result in ref .",
    "@xcite that a black hole with a mass less than @xmath22 has no horizon .",
    "the basic physics is the same : @xmath23 vanishes for @xmath21 .    because our value of the coefficient of @xmath24 in the denominator of @xmath23 agrees with that found by ref .",
    "@xcite , if we use their prescription for the relationship between @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the regime where the lapse function vanishes , we get the same hawking radiation phenomenology as they do : a very massive black hole evaporates until it reaches a mass @xmath27 at which the bekenstein - hawking temperature vanishes , leaving a planck scale remnant .",
