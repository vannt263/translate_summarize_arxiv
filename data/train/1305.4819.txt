    "<S> one possibility is to declare a realization as endemic whenever its coverage reaches 1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , from a computational point of view , this option is too costly . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore take advantage of the following fact : in an infinite size system , whenever the coverage of a realization reaches a finite fraction ( even small ) , the probability of the realization being endemic is 1 . </S>",
    "<S> then , in finite systems , we declare a realization as endemic whenever its coverage reaches a predefined value ( in our case @xmath70 , see si for tests with other values  @xcite ) and stop the realization at this point . </S>",
    "<S> then , we can measure the average lifetime of finite realizations @xmath71 and the position of its peak , which we take as the estimate of the epidemic threshold for finite systems . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that the method can be applied starting from any node of the network with identical results as far as the position of the threshold is concerned . here , to minimize the fluctuations of @xmath71 close to the critical point , we start our simulations always from the node with highest degree .    figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the result of this program in random pl networks generated with the uncorrelated configuration model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the average lifetime @xmath71 behaves as an effective susceptibility and , thus , we estimate the epidemic threshold for a finite network as the position of its peak , @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> these estimates are shown in the bottom plots and compared with the upper bound given by a numerical solution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lambdac ] ) and where @xmath21 is obtained from numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> as it can be clearly seen , the upper bound predicted by our theory is in very good agreement with numerical simulations , even for @xmath64 , a network clearly `` unclustered '' according to  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> notice that , due to the approximation made in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:2 ] ) , our theory neglects the propagation of the epidemic mediated only by connected nodes , which is the approach taken in the hmf theory . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one should expect that the true upper bound for the real epidemic threshold is the minimum between the estimation given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lambdac ] ) and @xmath73 . from this perspective , it is surprising that the epidemic threshold measured from simulations is higher than @xmath73 for small system sizes . </S>",
    "<S> notice , however , that the hmf theory of the sis dynamics completely neglects dynamical correlations . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations account for the fact that , whenever a node is infected , there is a high probability for the node that infected it to be still infected . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the number of neighbors available to an infected node to further propagate the epidemics is , in most cases , its degree minus 1 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , a better upper bound for the local propagation of the dynamics is given by the hmf theory of the sir model , that is @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> bottom plots of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] show the estimation of @xmath75 , which is always above the real threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> to sum up , the behavior of the sis epidemic threshold in networks depends on a delicate balance between their local and global properties . </S>",
    "<S> both hmf and qmf theories are constructed by considering only the local dynamics of infections among nearest neighbors , and thus fail to provide a correct description . </S>",
    "<S> here we have presented a theoretical approach to epidemics in networks , built upon previously sketched concepts , that takes into account the full network structure , and that considers reinfection events among nodes not directly connected , i.e. mediated by chains of other nodes . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical analysis , while based in some ( reasonable ) approximations , is well backed up by means of reliable numerical evidence . </S>",
    "<S> the main conclusion of both approaches is that the epidemic threshold in sis model is effectively null in the thermodynamic limit in all random small - world networks with a degree distribution decaying slower than exponentially . beyond this remarkable result </S>",
    "<S> , our work highlights the subtle role that dynamical correlations might play in non - equilibrium heterogeneous systems near criticality .    </S>",
