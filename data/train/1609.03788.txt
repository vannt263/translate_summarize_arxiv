    "the interaction of light and matter leads to interesting phenomena such as the stark effect  @xcite , i.e. , the splitting and shifting of atomic spectral lines in electric fields .",
    "the static stark effect in constant fields can be studied with the dicke hamiltonian  @xcite , which is of fundamental importance in the field of quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "many theoretical studies of the dicke model focus on quantized theories of the laser , and the superradiant phase transition  @xcite . because most of the atom - field interactions in these studies only involve highly populated modes of the electric field , a semi - classical treatment that approximates the electric field as a @xmath1-number is sufficient .",
    "the quantized dicke hamiltonian becomes important in cavity - quantum electrodynamics  @xcite , where many field modes contribute and where the light - matter coupling constant is enhanced by the cavity .",
    "then , dynamical effects related to the energy spectrum of the full dicke hamiltonian are observable .",
    "in particular , as an indication of the static stark effect , the eigenvalues of the dicke hamiltonian show rabi splittings of the atomic energies , which leads to collapse and revival dynamics  @xcite .    the dynamic stark effect in alternating fields can be studied in an optical realization , where the atomic system is driven by a laser . in the dipole approximation",
    "this situation can be described by an explicit time - dependent contribution to the dicke hamiltonian . because the coupling to the external field is periodic with the laser frequency , the solutions of the schrdinger equation follow from floquet theory . for a single emitter with atom - cavity coupling and laser - driving in rotating - wave approximation",
    ", the floquet states and quasienergies can be calculated analytically  @xcite .",
    "the resulting shifted rabi splittings are a consequence of the dynamic stark effect .    in this article",
    "we generalize this result to more than one emitter using the full dicke and external laser - interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the dynamic stark effect is analyzed through evaluation of the emission spectrum of the laser - driven dicke system .",
    "in particular , we quantify the laser intensity dependent shifts of the emission peaks .",
    "in addition , we calculate the glauber function  @xcite that allows us to study the emission of nonclassical light  @xcite .",
    "most notably , we provide a physical picture to interpret the features of the glauber function appearing for finite laser intensity .",
    "this generalizes our previous results without external drive  @xcite and related studies  @xcite .",
    "we furthermore consider the possible generation of entanglement  @xcite between two emitters which we quantify by the so - called entanglement of formation .    to calculate the emission properties of such a coupled light - matter system we have to use the full input - output formalism  @xcite that explicitly takes the environmental degrees of freedom into account .",
    "the resulting input - output relations connect expectation values of output operators to those of the system operators , which requires knowledge about the reduced ( open ) system dynamics  @xcite . for weak system - environment coupling the dissipative evolution of the system",
    "is described by markovian master equations  @xcite . in view of the periodicity of the system",
    "hamiltonian floquet states can be used as the computational basis .",
    "the resulting floquet master equation  @xcite is markovian and has time - independent coefficients .",
