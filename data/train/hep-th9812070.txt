    "the present status of the relativistic direct interaction theory @xcite enables us to consider it as a natural basis for a consistent description of relativistic effects in various physical systems on different levels : classical , quantum , or statistical ones .",
    "the relativistic statistical mechanics of interacting particle systems is nowadays at an early stage of its development , although the classical partition function of a relativistic ideal gas was calculated by jttner in 1911 .",
    "one cause of this was indicated in report @xcite .",
    "ter haar and wergeland wrote : `` at extremely high temperatures relativistic effects may , of course , be important",
    ". then , however , matter behaves as a mixture of ideal gases and this limiting case poses no problem . by and large ,",
    "a relativistic theory of heat seems , therefore , to be of little practical importance '' .",
    "but the ` practical importance ' , being a very nonsmooth function on historical time , can not be considered as the main reason for theoretical investigation .    among various approaches to the relativistic direct interaction theory the single - time lagrangian formalism @xcite seems to be the most convenient in the consideration of the general problem of relativistic dynamics , as well as in the investigation of various approximations .",
    "this formalism has been extended to an arbitrary form of relativistic dynamics defined geometrically by means of space - like foliations of the minkowski space @xcite .",
    "transition from the classical lagrangian to the hamiltonian description allows one to consider the relativistic effects in the statistical and quantum mechanical properties of the particle systems .",
    "the present paper is concerned with relativistic models of the equilibrium statistical mechanics . in sec .",
    "2 , a brief introduction into the concept of the form of relativistic dynamics is presented .",
    "investigation of a classical and quantum relativistic ideal gas by means of the front form of dynamics is outlined in sec .",
    "relativistic generalization of a one - dimensional gas of hard spheres is obtained in sec .",
    "this gives an example of an exactly solvable model in the relativistic statistical mechanics with a nontrivial particle interaction .",
    "is devoted to the investigation of the first quasirelativistic ( post - newtonian ) approximation . in the instant form of dynamics the weakly - relativistic corrections to the thermodynamical functions of the dilute gas with short - range interactions",
    "are studied on the basis of the general structure , to the order @xmath0 , of the approximately relativistic hamiltonian . as an example , the relativistic correction to the van der waals equation to the order @xmath0 is obtained .",
    "let us consider a dynamical system consisting of @xmath1 interacting point particles .",
    "it is convenient to describe the evolution of this system in the ( @xmath2)-dimensional minkowski space @xmath3 with coordinates @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "we use the metric @xmath6 . in applications we put @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "the motion of the particles is described by the world lines @xmath9 being time - like one - dimensional unbounded submanifolds of the minkowski space .",
    "the relativistic freedom in the simultaneity definition makes possible different three - dimensional descriptions of the relativistic particle motions . according to dirac @xcite ,",
    "they are called the _ forms of relativistic dynamics_. within the framework of the single - time lagrangian or hamiltonian mechanics this concept may be introduced in the following way @xcite .",
    "let us consider foliation @xmath10 of the minkowski space @xmath3 by the hypersurfaces @xmath11 with the next property : every hypersurface @xmath12 must intersect the world lines @xmath13 of all the particles in one and only one point @xmath14 this allows us to consider @xmath15 as an evolution parameter of the system @xcite . in the poincar ' e - invariant theory , when we consider only time - like world lines , the hypersurfaces ( [ 2.2 ] ) must be space - like or isotropic : @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "then , we have @xmath18 , and the hypersurface equation has the solution @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the constraint @xmath22 enables us to determine the zeroth component of @xmath23 in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath24 .",
    "the parametric equations of the world lines of the particles in the given form of dynamics have the form : @xmath25    the evolution of the system is determined by @xmath26 functions @xmath27 .",
    "they may be considered as representatives for the sections @xmath28 of the trivial fibre bundle @xmath29 with @xmath26-dimensional fibre space @xmath30 .",
    "the latter constitutes the configuration space of our system .",
    "three dirac s forms of relativistic dynamics correspond to the following hypersurfaces : @xmath31 ( instant form ) , @xmath32 ( front form ) , and @xmath33 ( point form ) .",
    "other examples for the case @xmath7 may be found in @xcite .    in the relativistic lagrangian mechanics the lagrangian function @xmath34",
    "is defined on the infinite order jet space of the fibre bundle @xmath35 with the standard coordinates @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the values of these coordinates for the section @xmath37 belonging to the corresponding equivalence class from @xmath38 are @xmath39 , @xmath40",
    ".    the free - particle system is determined in any form of dynamics by the lagrangian @xmath41 depending on the first derivatives : @xmath42 @xmath43 being a rest mass of the particle . in the front form of dynamics",
    "it reads : @xmath44    in the general case the poincar ' e - invariance conditions forbid the existence of interaction lagrangians which are defined on the jet - space @xmath45 with some finite @xmath46 ( for example , with @xmath47 ) .",
    "this leads to serious difficulties in physical interpretation of the formalism , and , in fact , makes it impossible to obtain a closed form of the corresponding hamiltonian functions which is necessary for the development of the classical statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "this fact is the lagrangian counterpart of the famous no - interaction theorem in the hamiltonian relativistic mechanics @xcite .",
    "there are at least two possibilities to avoid this difficulty .",
    "the first is offered by the front form of dynamics in the two - dimensional minkowski space . in this case",
    "there exists a wide class of interaction lagrangians depending on the first order derivatives @xcite .",
    "this allows us to obtain corresponding hamiltonian functions by the standard legendre transformation that preserves the physical meaning of the position canonical coordinates .",
    "the second consists in the consideration of the approximation in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "at least in the first order approximation we may obtain the usual lagrangian functions depending on the first order derivatives @xcite .",
    "examples of using these possibilities in the investigation of relativistic effects in models of the equilibrium statistical mechanics will be considered in the next sections .",
    "as an illustrative example we shall consider here a description of the relativistic ideal gas by means of the front form of dynamics .",
    "the hamiltonian function of the free @xmath1-particle system has the form : @xmath48 with @xmath49 this hamiltonian can be obtained from the lagrangian by the usual legendre application .",
    "the @xmath50-dimensional coordinates @xmath51 cover the given region @xmath52 with @xmath53 , and @xmath54 belongs to the region @xmath55.as it is well known , all the information about thermodynamical properties of the system is contained in the expression for the canonical partition function @xcite : @xmath56 where , as usual , @xmath57 and the integration is performed over the phase space @xmath58 . in our case @xmath59.inserting into eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath60 where @xmath61 substitution of the front form hamiltonian immediately yields @xmath62",

    "the obtained expressions can be useful for the treatment of the quantum relativistic ideal gas with generalized statistics of arbitrary order @xmath76 . in this case",
    "it is convenient to consider the grand partition function @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 represent the operators of energy and of particle number , respectively , and @xmath80 denotes chemical potential @xcite .    assuming that the maximum value of the occupation number in a given energy state can be @xmath76 , any integer greater than 1 , and acting in a manner quite similar to the nonrelativistic case ( cf .",

    "einstein statistics ) . but",
    "this problem , connected with the bose condensation , is essential at a low temperature , @xmath88 , when relativistic correction seems to be negligible .",

    "we may write relativistic virial expansions for other thermodynamical functions of the quantum ideal gas , especially for the inner energy and specific heat .",
    "in the two - dimensional space - time @xmath109 , the front form of dynamics serves a wide class of nontrivial interaction hamiltonians in terms of the covariant canonical coordinates .",

    "we put @xmath116 . from the definition of the front form of dynamics it follows that momenta @xmath112 belong to the positive semiaxis @xmath117 : @xmath118 for the convenience of the comparison with the corresponding nonrelativistic calculations we assume that function @xmath119 has the form : @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 is some function which will be defined later .",
