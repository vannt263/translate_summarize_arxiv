    "there is a substantial literature on jet simulations going back to the time when the first supercomputers became available for computational astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the simulations of extragalactic radio jets that have been carried out typically have axisymmetric or cartesian slab - jet geometries ; a smaller number of three dimensional simulations have also been conducted .",
    "one of the most important features has generally been the assumption of a hot , tenuous and smoothly distributed ambient atmosphere .",
    "these simulations have been extremely informative , leading to significant insights into the physics of extragalactic jets .",
    "for example the production of jet knots and filamentary structure has been associated with non - linear development of kelvin - helmholtz modes @xcite ; slab - jet simulations have shown how the extragalactic dentist drill @xcite may work in practice @xcite and simulations of jets in atmospheres with density gradients @xcite have shown how the stability / instability of jets is influenced by the gradients in the ambient atmosphere .",
    "more recently , @xcite has mapped out a region of the parameter space of jet density ratio , @xmath2 and mach number , @xmath3 and has also simulated the progress of a light jet through a dense ( but uniform ) medium typical of gigahertz peak spectrum ( gps ) or compact steep spectrum ( css ) radio sources .    notwithstanding the insights provided by the above work , until recently one key element has not been addressed in detail and this is the nature of the background medium . in the case of classical double radio sources",
    ", there is ample justification for assuming an homogeneous medium .",
    "however , there is excellent observational motivation for the disruption or modification of radio source morphologies by an _",
    "inhomogeneous _ medium .",
    "for example , the existence of filamentary optical line - emitting gas adjacent to the inner radio lobes in m87 has been known for some time @xcite as has the hierarchical structure of m87 evident in both radio and x - ray images @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent chandra observations of the inner few kpc of m87 , indicate significant interaction of the inner radio plasma in m87 with the hot x - ray gas leading to the production of x - ray filaments .",

    "ism interaction in high redshift radio galaxies such as 4c41.17 @xcite , quasars such as 3c  48 @xcite , blazars such as mkn  501 @xcite , and the general class of gps and css sources @xcite , which motivated our current line of research in the first place .",
    "all of these sources show clear evidence for the interaction of a jet with a clumpy medium which substantially distorts the morphology of the radio source , in most cases producing accompanying emission line luminosity from the disturbed dense gas .",
    "there are other compelling reasons for considering the interaction of radio jets with an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "ever since the paper of @xcite , proposing an explanation for the @xcite relation between black hole mass and bulge mass , there has been an increasing appreciation of the importance of feedback processes involving active galactic nuclei and the evolving interstellar medium of forming galaxies . in principle , jets , winds and radiation emitted from the environs of the black hole can impede continued accretion into a forming galaxy thereby limiting its growth .",
    "the importance of jets stems from the realisation that disrupted jets can process @xmath4 steradians of solid angle in the interstellar medium ( e.g. @xcite ) and that they transport a large amount of momentum . for similar reasons",
    "the importance of jet ",
    "ism interactions has been appreciated in attempts to resolve the questions posed by cooling flows as well as the x - ray cavities associated with radio bubbles that are now being observed in these environments ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in recent work",
    "we have begun to investigate these phenomena through the simulation of two - dimensional slab jets issuing into an inhomogeneous medium @xcite .",
    "we have shown that a numerous different radio morphologies can arise as a result of the interaction of both the jet and lobes with a clumpy interstellar medium and we have compared the resulting radio morphologies with a number of well  known radio sources .",
    "some preliminary three - dimensional simulations have also been published @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a high resolution simulation of a radio jet interacting with an inhomogeneous interstellar medium in the form of a turbulently supported disk which extends our previous work in several different directions : ( 1 ) the simulation is three dimensional with a resolution of 512 cells in the ( cartesian ) coordinate directions and a spatial scale of 2 parsecs per cell .

    "( other types of distributions of warm gas that may be contemplated include that typical of the lyman-@xmath5 haloes observed in many high redshift radio galaxies .",
    "these will be considered in future papers in this series . )",
    "( 4 ) the hard and soft x - ray emissivity and surface brightness of the thermal plasma is calculated , in conjunction with the radio surface brightness image .",
    "these synthetic images provide valuable insights for the interpretation of observational data .",
    "this simulation illustrates four important phases in the evolution of a young radio galaxy : ( 1 ) an initial  flood and channel \" phase wherein the radio source is beginning to be established , but is still interacting strongly with the disk material .",
    "( 2 ) a quasi - spherical jet - driven bubble phase where the jet is fully disrupted and drives a pseudo - spherical bubble into the surrounding medium . ( 3 ) a rapid jet establishment phase where the last obstruction is ablated away and the jet reforms and crosses the spherical bubble rabidly until it breaks out .",

    "we discuss our justification of , and constraints on , the parameters chosen for the simulations .",
    "elliptical galaxies contain both baryonic and dark matter .",
    "the former dominates on scales close to the core and the latter dominates at large radii , say of order 10  kpc . since jet simulations frequently extend over this range of scales , we have constructed a family of potentials which we use to represent a combined , self - consistent distribution of baryonic ( luminous ) and dark matter . in the simulation presented here ,",
    "the scale of the simulation is such that the potential is dominated by the baryonic component close to the core .",
    "however , the dark matter does have some influence . hence , we present here a generic potential that is useful here and which can also be used in future simulations with a larger overall spatial scale , in which the dark matter has an even greater influence .",

    ", width=480 ]      the warm and cold interstellar medium has been known to be non - uniform ever since the first observations of nebulae in the late 19th and early 20th centuries ( although recognition of an interstellar medium as such came later in the 20th century ) . in these simulations",
    "we introduce a non - uniform medium , which is describable semi - analytically , with the view to assessing qualitatively the influence on inhomogeneity on the energetics of dynamical interactions  even if a full theoretical understanding of the non - uniformity unavailable .",
    "we compare a homogeneous model with an inhomogeneous model , at two resolutions , in order to comprehend the consequences of non - uniformity will take , in a global dynamical sense .    to establish non - uniform medium",
    "we make use of an obvious analogy with a turbulent medium .",
    "the physics literature on turbulence is vast , with results and models in a many fields of physical sciences , and astrophysics is is no exception . rather than attempt to review this huge topic here however ,",
    "we refer the reader to the recent astrophysically oriented annual reviews of @xcite , and @xcite as a starting point for background material , and then refer simply to some specific results that we use below to arrive at reasonable ( although not necessarily unique ) parameters for our non - uniform medium .",
    "it must be emphasized that for the present work we are not modelling actual turbulence in a genuine causally generated ism ( see @xcite for a recent large scale isothermal ism turbulence simulation ) .",
    "rather , we are taking a parameterisation for the non - uniform properties of generic turbulent media focusing on characteristics such as the variance , @xmath56 , the intermittency ( in skewed distributions ) , and _ two  point _ self - similar power - law structures , relying on a range of previous experimental and theoretical results from the field of turbulence .",
    "hence the initial distribution of the ism that we employ should be regarded as a physically motivated generalisation of a homogeneous model , whilst not necessarily representing an accurate physical model of a turbulent ism .",
    "turbulence naturally gives rise to non - uniform structure , in velocity and density fields .",
    "we neglect the velocity structure , and focus on choosing statistical parameters to describe the density .",
    "this is justified numerically by the relatively small turbulent velocities expected when compared to the very large velocities found in our global jet ",
    "ism interaction .",
    "the velocities observed in typical warm ism conditions fall in a range of transonic to mildly supersonic values , mach 1 - 4 ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . at temperatures at or below @xmath57  k",
    "this corresponds to velocities @xmath58 . in our 1  kpc simulations over @xmath59  yr timescales ,",
    "the resulting displacements amount to less than 2 or 3 cells , and are insignificant compared to those of the radio jet and the energy bubble / cocoon generated by the main outburst , wherein velocities of hundreds or thousands of km / s occur .",
    "consequently , we do not impose a turbulent velocity field on the warm medium , and focus instead on constructing the density field .",
    "we use a log  normal distribution to describe the single point statistics of the density field of our nonuniform ism .",
    "the log  normal distribution is a skewed continuous probability distribution . unlike the normal distribution",
    ", it has a non - zero skewness , variable kurtosis , and in general the mode , median and mean are unequal .",
    "the log - normal distribution appears to be a nearly universal property of isothermal turbulent media in experimental , numerical and analytical studies ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , see also @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it is encouraging that the log  normal distribution is the limiting distribution for the product of random increments , in the same way that the normal distribution plays that role for additive random increments .",
    "it is thus compatible , at least conceptually , with a generic cascading process consisting of repeated folding and stretching .",
    "we begin by describing parameters for an inhomogeneous interstellar medium density field , which is on average isotropic .",

    "we adopt @xmath66 , @xmath67 , as our standard log  normal distribution .",
    "these values are compatible with the favored ranges in @xcite and @xcite from star burst galaxy reddening and extinction considerations .",
    "the variance measures how concentrated the mass is in dense cores , or conversely how much volume is occupied by voids , and these parameters give a flatness parameter @xmath68 , indicative of an intermittent distribution ( see appendix  [ a : lognormal ] ) . with these parameters ,",
    "densities below the mean , @xmath69 , comprise one quarter of the mass , and occupy three quarters of the volume , and the mean is approximately 20 times the mode ( see   [ a : turb_disk ] for further details ) .",
    "other values are possible of course , and a proposed relationship between the log - normal variance and the isothermal mach number of the turbulence given by @xcite , viz .",
    "@xmath70 suggests that higher mach numbers in an agn medium for example , could be compatible with larger variances .",
    "below , when we use turbulent velocity support to determine the scale height of the warm ism disk in the galactic potential , we adopt a turbulent velocity that is consistent with the value @xmath67 adopted here ; hence the turbulent velocity is not a completely independent parameter in the model .",
    "the two  point structure of a homogeneous turbulent medium is best described in fourier space .",
    "we denote the fourier transform of the density @xmath71 by @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 is the wavenumber vector ) . the isotropic power spectrum @xmath74 is the integral over solid angle in fourier space of the spectral density @xmath75 .",
    "in three dimensions : @xmath76 . even if the spectral density is anisotropic , the angular integral averages the spectral density into a one dimensional function of @xmath73 only .    for a power - law dependence on @xmath73 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ,",
    "the spectrum is referred to as kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "it has been shown that a scalar tracer ( density ) of the turbulent field also shows the kolmogorov structure index @xcite .",
    "we follow @xcite and adopt a standard density power spectrum with a kolmogorov power - law with @xmath78 to generate a spatial structure power - law for the density in our non - uniform ism . given our assumption above that the ( isothermal ) disk is mainly supported by supersonic turbulence , a slightly different value of @xmath79 associated with shock turbulence may be a reasonable alternative ( e.g. @xcite ) but we postpone investigation of the variation of @xmath80 to future work .      for our inhomogeneous ism we select @xmath66 and @xmath67 as our standard log ",
    "normal density field parameters , and a kolmogorov @xmath78 power - law spatial index .",
    "this structure is modified as described below in ",
    "[ s : turb_disk ] to take account of a spatially variable mean density .",
    "the selected parameters may be representative in view of the results of @xcite and @xcite noted above .",
    "however , at this stage not a lot is known about the parameters of the inhomogeneous ism of radio galaxies .    in order to simultaneously achieve log - normal single - point statistics and a power - law self - similar structure ,",
    "we have implemented the practical method developed by atmospheric scientists , for constructing two and three dimensional terrestrial cloud models , which are used in radiative transfer calculations @xcite .",
    "the first step of the procedure involves constructing a cube in which each cell has a gaussian distribution of mean zero .",
    "this cube is fourier transformed and then apodized by a power - law in wave number .",
    "the apodized cube is then fourier transformed back to the spatial domain and retains its gaussian statistics because a sum of gaussians is still a gaussian . a cube with log - normal statisitics is then produced by exponentiating the gaussian cube .",
    "however , as re - transformation to fourier space shows this alters the power - law in wave number property .",
    "essentially the generation of dense cores and large voids consistent with the log - normal parameters , alters the low and high wavenumber ends of an original power - law , breaking self - similarity .",
    "hence , the deviation from a power - law is calculated and this is used to estimate a correction to the power - law of the gaussian distribution .",
    "successive corrections are applied until satisfactory convergence to a power - law ( within approximately 1% ) is obtained , usually in about 46 iterations for distributions with modest variances ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the process converges more slowly as the target variance , @xmath56 , increases , and variances @xmath82 were not attempted .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for further details of this method .    from this process",
    "a library of cubes with a range of resolutions and variances were pre - computed for use in a range of simulations , from which our standard set : @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath78 was selected .",
    "the remaining choice in this procedure is to select the range of wave numbers over which to generate the fractal , in particular the minimum wave number @xmath83 , which determines the largest structure scale in the resulting fractal with respect to the spatial grid . with the scale height of the disk in the simulations being of order 100  pc in a domain of 1  kpc extent ,",
    "a minimum wave number of @xmath84 is used to ensure that the largest ` clouds ' are of order 50  pc , and appropriate to the scale of the disk everywhere . in the final structure",
    "used to form the disk , the wave numbers in the fourier domain range from @xmath85 to the nyquist limit , @xmath86 , covering just over 1.1 decades of scale .",
    "this is limited by the computational requirements for the overall grid , and the fact that the disk is only a small part of the domain .",
    "significant improvement requires a substantial increase in computing resources than are available to treat more than say 2 decades of structure in the fractal disk alone .",
    "that said however , we did perform the simulation with two resolutions , low and high , discussed in  [ s : simpars ] , to investigate resolution dependent differences , and the differences of the low and high resolution fractal simulations from a uniform model . the evolution of these different simulations is evidence that at least some of the fractal properties are being captured .      as noted in ",
    "[ s : intro ] many radio galaxies exhibit a turbulent disk of gas in the central regions , motivating us to consider the interaction of a jet with such a disk .",
    "let us now consider the establishment of a disk - like distribution of gas in some detail .",
    "there are two elements to establishing a turbulent disk .",
    "we begin with the fractal , power - law distribution described above .",
    "this may be scaled to give a fractal distribution with a specific , but constant , mean density .",
    "this is unsatisfactory since the distribution of gas would not reflect the potential of the galaxy .",
    "hence , we derive below expressions for the _ mean _ density of a turbulent gas disk in the potential discussed in  [ s : potential ] .",

    "we express the density and velocity as statistical averages , as follows , with the angle brackets expressing ensemble averages : @xmath88 for a recent description of this mass - averaged approach to a statistical description of turbulent flow , see @xcite .",
    "we derive the relevant equations for our warm clumpy disk in the appendix , showing en - route that the azimuthal velocity in the turbulent disk is a function of the cylindrical radius only",

    "( equation  ( [ e : warm_gas ] ) assumes that @xmath92 and @xmath93 are constant throughout the disk . )",
    "the main differences from the development of a similar equation by @xcite is the ( mandatory ) lack of dependence of @xmath91 on @xmath97 and the formal introduction of a turbulent velocity .",
    "the latter avoids the difficulty of prescribing an unphysically large temperature in order to achieve a reasonable disk scale height .    in summary",
    "then , we use the double isothermal potential @xmath30with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , scaled by @xmath98  kpc , and @xmath99  km / s , and a rotation parameter @xmath100 , plus a velocity dispersion of the warm gas of @xmath101  km / s for the disk .",

    "here we discuss the selection of parameters for the jet , potential and hot and warm components of the atmosphere .",
    "physical objectives dominate the criteria by which we select these parameters but the selection is also governed by the desired resolution and spatial dynamic range constrained by the necessity for a realistic number of cells in the grid . in this subsection",
    "we discuss other , global , resolution constraints on the simulation ; in the following subsection (   [ s : scaling ] ) we consider how the simulations may be scaled .",
    "if a jet is 20  pc wide where it enters the grid and we require 10 cells across the jet in order to resolve it adequately with a lagrangian  remap ppm algorithm , then the maximum spatial size of a @xmath118 grid is just over a kiloparsec .",
    "hence , using a code with fixed sized cells , such as _ ppmlr _ the range of scales is limited to those relevant to gigahertz peak spectrum ( gps ) sources .",
    "nevertheless , some of the features present in the simulations would probably also be relevant to larger scale sources and we indicate these in the sections below .    in adiabatic simulations",
    "the precise choice of parameters is not highly constrained since arbitary spatial , velocity and density scales may be applied . however , since we have introduced cooling processes the scaling that is allowed is restricted to a one parameter set ( see [ s : scaling ] ) so that we need to exercise some care in selecting parameters that provide both physically consistent and interesting simulations , which reveal the range of feasible interactions between a jet and an inhomogeneous interstellar medium .",
    "the process of choosing realistic parameters is both interesting and informative .    for the jet",
    "the relevant relativistic parameters are : velocity in units of the speed of light @xmath80 ( equivalently lorentz factor @xmath119 ) , pressure @xmath120 defined by its ratio @xmath106 to the external ism pressure and the proper density parameter @xmath121 .",
    "the non - relativistic counterparts are the velocity @xmath9 , mach number @xmath3 , the pressure , and the ratio of jet to ism densities , @xmath2 .",
    "the kinetic power of a jet [ see equation  ( [ e : fe_rel ] ) ] provides one constraint on jet parameters . another useful constraint comes from consideration of the hot - spot advance speed .",
    "many fr2 radio lobes display broad structure that indicates that the head of the lobe is not expanding at high velocity ; this is confirmed by statistical estimates of average lobe expansion in powerful sources @xmath122 a few percent of the speed of light @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "following the idea of @xcite which more recently has become formally expressed in the form of self - similar evolution of radio galaxy lobes ( e.g. @xcite ) the lobe advance is affected by the spread of the jet momentum over an area that is larger than the jet cross - section . on the other hand the `` instantaneous '' hot - spot velocities in a number of gps sources have been observed to be a considerable fraction of the speed of light ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore in the first instance it is useful to consider the hot - spot advance speed @xmath123 calculated from ram pressure balance at the jet terminus . for a relativistic jet expanding into a thermal medium ,",
    "the instantaneous hot spot advance speed is given by : @xmath124 where @xmath125^{1/2 } =   \\left ( \\frac { 4 p_{\\rm jet}}{\\rho_{\\rm ism } c^2 } \\right)^{1/2 } \\ , \\left ( 1 + \\chi \\right)^{1/2 }   \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xcite .",
    "let @xmath126 be the total number density of the interstellar medium in the vicinity of the hot spot and let @xmath112 be the jet diameter .",
    "then , the jet kinetic power can be expressed in terms of the hot - spot parameters as follows : @xmath127 \\ , \\left [ \\frac { \\beta_{\\rm hs}^2/\\beta^2 } { 1 - \\beta_{\\rm hs}^2/\\beta^2 } \\right ] \\ , n_{\\rm ism } \\ , \\beta a   \\ , ,   \\nonumber \\\\ &",

    "most of the dependence of the jet power enters through the local interstellar medium density , the jet diameter and the instantaneous hot spot advance speed .    at a kiloparsec from the core ,",
    "@xmath129 and @xmath130 are reasonable fiducial values . at 10  kpc , @xmath131 and @xmath132",
    "may be more appropriate .",
    "in the first case , @xmath133 and @xmath134 give a jet power @xmath135 typical of the most powerful fr2 jets ; @xmath136 implies a power @xmath137 at the lower end of the fr2 range . on the other hand , for fr2 jets on a scale of 10 kpc , @xmath136 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 gives a power @xmath140 .",
    "thus fr2 jets remain powerful from small to large scales if the effective diameter of the jet widens , in response to the evolving dynamics of the lobe ( which confines the jet ) and the instabilities in the jet itself leading to jittering and filamentation .",
    "we have selected a jet for which the instantaneous @xmath141 is of order 0.05 - 0.1 and the initial jet diameter is @xmath142 .",
    "these parameters , together with a central ism @xmath143 places the jet at the low end of fr2 power @xmath144 .",
    "this choice of parameters produces a jet which initially interacts strongly with the ambient ism but whose morphology at later times is similar to a classical fr2 radio source .",
    "test simulations ( not presented here ) show that with higher - powered jets the hot spot advance rapidly becomes focused when the jet emerges from the inhomogeneous region surrounding the core and the advance speed is quite high .",
    "thus , this simulation is designed to show the characteristics of the range of interactions that can occur . however , for these characteristics to be be manifest in higher powered sources , it is probably necessary to relax the assumption of an equilibrium disk for the inhomogeneous ism .",
    "future parameter studies will be used to map out different regimes in more detail .",
    "radio galaxies are mainly associated with the high luminosity end of the elliptical galaxy distribution . however , fr2 galaxies are less optically luminous than fr1s @xcite .",
    "therefore , we adopt a velocity dispersion of the baryonic matter of @xmath145 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the dark matter is @xmath146 .",
    "the latter choice is driven by the physical requirement that the dark matter in an elliptical galaxy is more extended than the baryonic matter and by the numerical requirements imposed by resolution and number of cells discussed above .",
    "this combination of different dark matter and baryonic matter scales is naturally treated by the double isothermal potential described in  [ s : potential ] .",
    "the selection of parameters for the hot medium is straightforward .",
    "we choose a temperature for the ( isothermal ) medium close to the virial temperature defined by the dark matter .",

    "observationally , this is justified by the inference of supersonic turbulence in the disk in the center of m87 @xcite and the gaseous disk in ngc  7052 @xcite .",
    "the density scale of the log - normal distribution at the centre of the galaxy , @xmath149 is defined by approximate total ( thermal plus turbulent ) pressure equilibrium with the ambient hot medium , that is , @xmath150 2 .",
    "the density scale of the warm gas at each cell of the simulation is defined by equation  ( [ e : warm_gas ] ) for the mean density @xmath151 of warm turbulent gas in the potential well of the galaxy .",

    "that a given simulation describe a set of scaleable physical situations it is necessary that the scaled cooling function have the same functional form .",
    "thus unless @xmath172 has some special from ( e.g. a power - law ) it is necessary that the parameter @xmath173 be invariant under scaling .",
    "hence , the parameter @xmath174 is invariant ; this is the major difference from adiabatic scaling in which @xmath174 may be arbitrary .",
    "the spatial scale @xmath175 is arbitrary , but @xmath176 is restricted by the constancy of @xmath174 .",
    "moreover , in order that the primed equations describe the same situation , the parameter @xmath177 must be invariant . referring to equation  ( [ e : lambda_0 ] )",

    "a given simulation defines a one - parameter family of simulations where the scaling parameters satisfy the following constraints : @xmath181 with the proviso that @xmath175 can not increase to the extent that the gas density exceeds the density of gravitating matter .",
    "notwithstanding this restricted one - parameter scaling , the allowable set of physical models allowed by this scaling describes an interesting variety of different physical situations .",
    "three simulations were performed in this paper , models * a * , * b * , and * c*. however , the first ( model * a * ) is presented as the standard model , in the greatest detail .",

    "a collimated jet flow has been established and the jet is about to pierce the initial bubble .",
    "subsequently , the jet propagates beyond the bubble and starts to establish a classic double lobe morphology consisting of bow - shock , cocoon and backflow .",
    "another way of looking at this phase is that the quasi - isotropic ( energy - driven ) phase of radio lobe expansion makes a transition to a bow - shock dominated ( momentum - driven ) phase as the now relatively undeflected jet progresses through the interstellar medium .",
    "an interesting feature , which is discussed further below , is that the jet , whilst maintaining a more or less single direction , is unstable . as a result of both filamentation and helical instabilities ,",

    "mid - plane pressure slices in figure  [ f : presslice ] confirm the evolutionary features revealed by the density and at the same time show some additional characteristics .",
    "the flood and channel phase ( 5  25  kyr ) shows a high - pressured amorphous region where the jet struggles to make its way out of the confining disk .",
    "the lower pressure dense gas ( the white region ) surrounds this amorphous bubble .    in the energy - driven bubble phase ( 35  55  kyr )",
    "the pressure in the jet - driven bubble is fairly uniform ( as expected ) but also shows at 35 kyr a biconical shock associated with the compression of the emerging jet by the overpressured bubble . and a bow shock caused by obstructing high density gas in the path of the jet .",
    "there are also some spots of high pressure associated with the general turbulence in the bubble .    during the jet - breakout phase ( 55  70  kyr )",
    "most of the radio lobe is at constant pressure , and there are only small residual regions of low pressure associated with the disk .",
    "further biconical shocks form within the jet and the high pressure jet terminus is seen propagating through the bubble .    during the classical phase ( 75  95  kyr the hot spot at the end of the jet pierces the bubble and forms a higher pressure , momentum - driven cocoon .",
    "the biconical shocks do not persist within this cocoon and the high pressure region at the end of the jet is spread out over more than a jet diameter .",

    "the emissivity is defined by : @xmath293 where @xmath5 is the spectral index .",
    "this form of the emissivity assumes that the magnetic pressure tracks the plasma pressure , that is , @xmath294 .",
    "the scalar tracer @xmath295 , which is the mass concentration by density of the non - thermal plasma , is used to indicate the presence of jet plasma at the various regions of the grid .",
    "an approach that we have used in previous papers ( e.g. @xcite ) is to simply take the emissivity proportional to the tracer .",
    "this has the desired effect of making the emissivity non - zero where @xmath296 ( the jet value ) and zero in the background , where @xmath297 .",
    "this ansatz is innapropriate in regions of intermediate values of @xmath295 since the nonthermal pressure , which determines the jet emissivity , dominates even when the ratio of non  thermal to total density is small .",
    "hence , in order to gain a more accurate idea of the distribution of non - thermal emission we use the above expression ( [ e : emissivity ] ) for the emissivity when @xmath295 is greater than some threshold value , usually about @xmath298 .",
    "the radio images produced from this emissivity do not include the effects of aberration , relativisitic beaming , or spectral steepening .",
    "they correspond best to low frequency observations where electron - aging effects are less .",
    "they are intended as reasonable indicators of the distribution of radio emission .",
    "the detailed modelling of all the possible non - thermal emission processes ( primarily synchrotron and inverse compton ) from a frame of the simulation to the level required for a point by point prediction and comparison with a specific radio observation is beyond the scope of the current investigation . in future , with a fuller relativistic and mhd treatment , detailed radio emission predictions will be included .",
    "the radio thermal emissivity cubes are ray - traced using a volumetric ray - tracing program , _ render _ , to provide synthetic surface brightness images , as well as for column densities and other more general projection of variables .",
    "_ render _ is a 2d and 3d volumetric renderer that preserves surface brightnesses , and uses homogeneous coordinates for projecting a range of cartesian and other geometries , under a range of transformations , including perspective ( not utilized here ) , plus rotations , affine transforms and stereoscopic modes .",
    "the _ render _ code also handles a range of geometries and symmetries , and in the double jet renderings of the radio emission ( e.g. in figures  [ f : inu_a ] and [ f : inu_b ] ) the simulation data are reflected in the @xmath299 plane , perpendicular to the initial jet direction during the ray - tracing process .",
    "perspective and other depth cueing transformations have been turned off for all the following figures , resulting in the projection as seen from an infinite distance from the source .",
    "a series of synthetic radio surface brightness snapshots is displayed in figures  [ f : inu_a ] and [ f : inu_b ] at the same times as in the previous figures of desnity and pressure slices .",
    "note that the panels are split across two figures in order not to lose detail in the double - sided surface brightness images .    at the early times ( 5",
    " 15  kyr ) the surface brightness shows the amorphous structure that is evident in the density slices discussed above .    in the flood and channel phase from approximately 25  45  kyr , we see the formation of the two radio - emitting bubbles with some flocculent structure evident in the surface brightness resulting from the non - uniform thermalisation of jet plasma during this phase .",
    "we also see quite clearly ( particularly at 35  kyr and 45  kyr ) the bow shock ( on each side ) caused by the impact of the jet on the obstructing cloud revealed in the density and pressure slices discussed above .    during the jet - breakout phase from 55  70  kyr , the radio - emitting bubbles become smoother in appearance but high surface brightness features associated initially with the jet - cloud bow shock ( 55  kyr ) and then with the jet terminal shock ( 65 and 70  kyr ) are also seen propagating out through the respective bubbles . another feature which becomes obvious here , but",
    "which is also evident from approximately 25  kyr onwards , is a band of low surface brightness emission caused by the partial exclusion of radio - emitting plasma from the disk region .    from 75  kyr",
    "onwards we see the effect of the jets breaking free of the bubbles .    .",
    "the insets for 5  kyr and 10  kyr show the surface brightness images magnified by factors of 3 and 2 respectively in order to bring out the detail in these early stages.,width=480 ]    .,width=480 ]        below , we show x - ray images calculated for specific x - ray emission bands .",
    "these images are calculated as follows .",
    "first , the x - ray spectrum , corresponding to the cooling function used in the calculations is calculated as a function of temperature .",
    "this is a by - product of the original evaluation of the cooling function . in the range 0.110kev the spectra consist of 1100 energy bins .",
    "second , integrals over specified sub - bands are evluated and the fraction of the total cooling in those bands is evaluated .",
    "third , the fractions of the total cooling in each band are tabulated .",
    "the _ render _ code then uses the total emissivity and temperature cubes to determine the volume emissivity in each band of interest and then ray - traces the emissivity to form the images presented below in  [ s : xray.images ] .",
    "self - absorption is neglected , as is any form of scattering , thus restricting this analysis of the thermal emission to the x - ray domain for the present .",
    "the softest x - ray synthetic images are approximate since the neglected self - absorption is stronger for energies @xmath300 . despite this limitation the synthetic x - ray images",
    "give a good indication of the locations where soft or hard x - rays should dominate , although we do nt assign precise absolute values to the x - ray surface brightnesses at present , leaving them as relative fluxes .",
    "three color x - ray images as well as single band images can be generated but these are not presented here .",
    "snapshots of the soft ( 0.1  0.75  kev ) and hard ( 1.5  10  kev ) x - ray surface brightness are presented in figures  [ f : xsoft1 ] , [ f : xsoft2 ] , [ f : xhard1 ] and [ f : xhard2 ] .    in order to indicate the contribution from gas at various temperatures to the emission in the soft and hard bands",
    ", we have included a grayscale bar in each x - ray image which indicates the relative contribution of gas at a specific temperature to the emissivity in the specific band .",
    "light indicates a low relative contribution ; dark indicates a high relative contribution .",
    "thus the dominant contribution in the soft x - ray band is from gas in the range @xmath301 .",
    "however , there is also some contribution from gas at higher temperatures up to and exceeding @xmath302 . in the hard x - ray band",
    "there is little contribution from gas whose temperature is below @xmath303 ; the dominant contribution is from gas whose temperature exceeds approximately @xmath304 .      during the period from 545  kyr the soft x - ray emission is dominated by emission from the disk as the developing bubble of non - thermal plasma sweeps through driving moderate velocity radiative shocks into the dense gas concentrations within the log - normal disk . the bright ( i.e. dark color ) emission is the result of the slower shocks producing a temperature @xmath305 in the high density material .",
    "the brightness of the emission is also enhanced by the density squared dependence of the emissivity .",
    "some faint emission from the gas at the outer parts of the disk is also visible resulting from the driving of radiative shocks into the disk by the higher pressure hot interstellar medium .",
    "this is a consequence of the way in which the initial distribution of gas has been established and not too much should be read into the details of this emission .",
    "as the simulation evolves ( figure  [ f : xsoft2 ] ) an additional feature appears ",
    "x - ray emission from the spherical bubbles blown by the jets on either side of the double source . at 95  kyr ,",
    "faint features corresponding to the piercing of the bubbles by the jets are just perceptible .",
    "the hard x - ray emission ( figures  [ f : xhard1 ] and [ f : xhard2 ] ) presents a similar evolutionary picture with some interesting differences .",
    "the first obvious feature is that the x - ray emission from the jet - driven bubbles is much brighter relative to the disk than in the soft x - ray case and the `` dimples '' on the edge of the bubbles caused by the jet breakout and the formation of the classical radio lobe structure are more apparent both at 85 and 95  kyr .",
    "the simple reason for this is that the shocks associated with the bubbles are much faster than those driven into the disk and shock the ambient gas to a much higher temperature  typically @xmath306 compared to @xmath305 .",
    "the second feature is that the hard x - ray emission from the disk is smoother than the soft x - ray emission .. this is the result of the emission from faster shocks being driven into lower density gas in between the dense concentrations within the disk .",
    "one of the most significant features of both the hard and soft x - ray emission is that the disk remains bright well after the jet has broken free and started to form a radio lobe .",
    "this occurs because the high - pressured bubble continues to drive shocks into the disk gas .",
    "however , the brightest phase of the radio plasma ",
    "jet interaction occurs when the jet plasma is forcing its way through the disk .",
    "this is evident from the images and more quantitatively from the plots of x - ray luminosity ( figure  [ f : l_x ] ) , which we discuss further below .",
    "in addition to the general x - ray luminous features discussed above , we can see wisps of radiating gas , which are entrained into the lower regions of the bubble .",
    "figures [ f : totcool ] and [ f : innertotcool ] show the overall contribution to total thermal cooling dominated by the clumpy disk material , and show how some of the entrained ism gas forms filaments which cool and increase in contrast at late times , as well as the great brightness of the dense cloud cores that remain in the disk throughout .",
    "filaments are particularly evident in the jet breakout phase from 55  70  kyr .",
    "this entrainment is also discussed further below in  [ s : transport ] .    the @xmath307 x - ray emission for models * a * , * b * and * c * as a function of time is shown in figure  [ f : l_x ] .",
    "the common feature of all the luminosity curves is that they rise approximately linearly to a broad maximum and then decline . for the more realistic models * a * and * b * , the maximum luminosity is a fraction of one percent of the jet energy flux . in the physically unrealistic model   * c * , the peak x - ray luminosity is about 1.6% of the jet energy flux . in all cases ,",
    "the peak x - ray luminosity occurs when the jet can be considered to have just broken free of the disk . before that epoch",
    "a portion of the jet power is being directed into the radiative shocks that are responsible for the x - ray emission .",
    "when the jet breaks out , the fraction of its power that was being diverted into radiative shocks is reduced since the jet power is now diverted into non - radiative shocks in the hot interstellar medium .",
    "given the major morphological disruptions revealed by these simulations ( especially for radio plasma ) , why is the efficiency of conversion @xmath308 of jet power into x - ray luminosity so low ?",
    "this is mainly the result of the relative density of the jet and clouds : let the density of the jet be @xmath309 and the density of a cloud be @xmath310 .",
    "then , momentum balance in the jet  cloud shock system gives us the well - known result that the velocity of the radiative cloud shock is @xmath311 .",
    "the energy flux density in the shocked gas , which is converted into radiation is given by @xmath312 .",
    "hence the efficiency of conversion of jet power into radiation is partly determined by the factor @xmath313 which is of order @xmath314 here . given the efficiency factor @xmath315 associated with the jet to cloud density ratio it is therefore unsurprising to find that the peak efficiency is of order 1% .",
    "the other factor affecting the conversion of jet power to radiation is the effective cross sectional area of the jet that is tapped to produce shocks .",
    "this depends , at any one time , upon how much of the jet is obstructed by dense gas .",
    "hence , we see an almost identical rise in x - ray luminosity in models * a * , * b * and * c * as the jet intersects more gas as it attempts to break free and the increasing peak luminosity from model * a * to * c * , reflecting the longer period of obstruction as we progress through the models .",
    "figure [ f : l_fx ] shows the corresponding fractions of the total cooling in x - rays and in the soft and hard bands . in all the models ,",
    "the x - ray fraction of the total cooling rises to 3540% , until the bubble clears the disk .",
    "it then declines as the overall cooling becomes increasingly dominated by the very hot main bubble .",
    "nevertheless , the disk continues to contribute a significant percentage of the cooling throughout the simulation . in",

    "the interaction of the jet with the dense warm disk causes a redistribution of mass as a result of the momentum imparted to the warm gas .",
    "we examine this process here in detail for two purposes : ( 1 ) too ascertain the potential role of such jet  disk interactions on the feedback of black holes on forming galaxies . and",
    "( 2 ) to examine the continued presence of gas in the nuclear regions of radio galaxies well after the passage of the jet to large distances from the core .",
    "we examine the redistribution of gas here in all three models * a * , * b * and * c * ( see  [ s : simpars ] ) with the particular emphasis on examining the effect of the greater porosity in models * a * and * b * , compared to * c*.      figure  [ f : abc_dens ] is a side by side comparison of the density of the three models at 75  kyr .",
    "as expected the dynamical states of the simulations are quite different .",

    "<S> we present three dimensional simulations of the interaction of a light hypersonic jet with an inhomogeneous thermal and turbulently supported disk in an elliptical galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations are applicable to the gps / css phase of extragalactic radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> the interstellar medium in these simulations consists of a conventional hot ( @xmath0 ) component together with a warm ( @xmath1 ) turbulently supported disk whose local density is described by a log - normal density distribution and whose spatial structure is realized from a fractal power - law . </S>",
    "<S> we model the jet as a light , supersonic non - relativistic flow with parameters selected to be consistent with a relativistic jet with kinetic power just above the fr1/fr2 break .    </S>",
    "<S> we identify four generic phases in the evolution of such a jet with the inhomogeneous interstellar medium : 1 ) an initial `` flood and channel '' phase , where progress is characterized by high pressure gas finding changing weak points in the ism , flowing through channels that form and re - form over time , 2 ) a spherical , energy - driven bubble phase , were the bubble is larger than the disk scale , but the jet remains fully disrupted close to the nucleus , 3 ) a subsequent , rapid , jet break  out phase the jet breaks free of the last obstructing dense clouds , becomes collimated once more and pierces the spherical bubble , and 4 ) a classical phase , the jet propagates in a momentum - dominated fashion similar to jets in single component hot haloes , leading to the classical jet  cocoon  bow - shock structure .    </S>",
    "<S> mass transport in the simulations is investigated , and we propose a model for the morphology and component proper motions in the well - studied compact symmetric object 4c31.04 . </S>"
