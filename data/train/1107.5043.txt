    "core - collapse supernovae are energetic explosions that mark the death of stars more massive than @xmath20  m@xmath8 .",
    "they are extremely important in several areas of astrophysics , including the nucleosynthesis of chemical elements , energy feedback that affects the evolution of galaxies , the formation of compact object remnants , the production of high - energy particles , as tracers of recent star - formation in galaxies , and as test cases of massive stellar evolution .",
    "supernovae discovered in nearby galaxies have been particularly important for testing our physical understanding of the explosions and to establish direct links between the events and their progenitors , which puts tight constraints on stellar evolution theory .",
    "the two best - studied nearby core - collapse supernovae , the peculiar type  ii sn  1987a in the lmc and the type  iib sn  1993j in m81 , had progenitors that were detected in pre - explosion images . both were very interesting cases that challenged theoretical expectations based on stellar evolution models that predicted red supergiants as their progenitor stars : sn  1987a had a @xmath21  m@xmath8 blue supergiant progenitor star ( e.g. , arnett et al .",
    "1989 ) and sn  1993j had a @xmath22  m@xmath8 yellow supergiant progenitor ( e.g. , aldering et al .",
    "1994 ) , which turned out to be a massive binary system ( e.g. , maund et al .",
    "2004 ) . after more than a decade of work , smartt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) presented a thorough study of nearby ( @xmath23  mpc ) type  ii - plateau supernovae with deep pre - explosion imaging ( see also li et al . 2005 ) , which allowed them to constrain the progenitors of type  iip supernovae to be red supergiants with initial main - sequence masses in the range @xmath24  m@xmath8 .",
    "this result is in conflict with well - studied red supergiant samples in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , levesque et al .",
    "2006 ) , which also contain massive supergiants with @xmath25  m@xmath8 , and a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) for high - mass stars .",
    "this  red supergiant problem \" can be alleviated if high - mass red or yellow supergiants produce other spectroscopic or photometric type  ii supernova sub - types ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2009 ; elias - rosa et al . 2009 , 2010 ) , or if high - mass supergiants experience strong winds due to pulsations ( e.g. , yoon & cantiello 2010 ) .",
    "very recently , walmswell & eldridge ( 2011 ) have proposed circumstellar dust as a possible solution .",
    "it can also be explained by failed supernovae , an hypothesis that would have several deep implications ( e.g. , kochanek et al . 2008 ) .",
    "in addition , there are known selection biases that have not been discussed in depth or accounted for .",
    "of the 18 nearby type  ii supernovae with fairly secure progenitor ( either single , binaries , or compact clusters ) detections , two of the 18 events were initially discovered by the galaxy - targeted lick observatory supernova search ( loss ; filippenko et al .",
    "2001 ) , and 14 of the 18 were initially discovered by dedicated amateur astronomers that mostly concentrate their search efforts in big galaxies .",
    "only 2 of these supernovae were found in dwarf galaxies ( sn  1987a and 2008ax ) and all the type  iips ( 10 of the 18 ) were found in the disks of spiral galaxies , mostly in grand - design spirals .    the existing selection bias against finding nearby core - collapse supernovae in dwarf galaxies could be important because @xmath26 of the local star formation rate density is in galaxies with absolute magnitude @xmath27  mag ( e.g. , james et al .",
    "2008 ; young et al . 2008 ; williams et al . 2011 ) .",
    "since metallicity is a key parameter in massive stellar evolution and stellar death ( e.g. , prieto et al . 2008a ; modjaz 2011 , and references therein ) , changes in the fractions of different type  ii spectroscopic subtypes with metallicity ( e.g. , arcavi et al . 2010 ) could affect our census of progenitors in local samples . also , possible variations of the stellar imf with environment ( e.g. , meurer et al .",
    "2009 ; but see , e.g. , myers et al .",
    "2011 and references therein ) can introduce complications to the progenitor analyses .",
    "recently , horiuchi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) discussed in detail related effects of incompleteness in the existing supernova rate measurements and how they affect their use as star formation rate indicators .",
    "in this paper we present the discovery , follow - up observations , and analysis of the nearby type  ii sn  2008jb ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) in a southern dwarf - irregular galaxy at @xmath30  mpc ( prieto et al .",
    "this bright @xmath31  mag supernova was missed by targeted southern supernova surveys , like chase ( pignata et al . 2009 ) and amateur searches , mainly because the host galaxy eso  302@xmath014 is a fairly low - luminosity dwarf and was not included in the catalogs of galaxies that are surveyed for supernovae .",
    "we are able to recover the optical light curves of this supernova from two surveys that do not target individual galaxies , but rather scan large areas of the sky : the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ; drake et al .",

    "<S> we present the discovery and follow - up observations of sn  2008jb , a core - collapse supernova in the southern dwarf irregular galaxy eso  302@xmath014 at . </S>",
    "<S> this nearby transient was missed by galaxy - targeted surveys and was only found in archival optical images obtained by the catalina real - time transient survey and the all - sky automated survey . </S>",
    "<S> the well sampled archival photometry shows that sn  2008jb was detected shortly after explosion and reached a bright optical maximum , @xmath1  mag ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the light curve shows a plateau of @xmath3  days , followed by a drop of @xmath4  mag in @xmath5-band to a slow decline with the approximate @xmath6co decay slope . </S>",
    "<S> the late - time light curve is consistent with @xmath7  m@xmath8 of @xmath6ni synthesized in the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> a spectrum of the supernova obtained 2  years after explosion shows a broad , boxy h@xmath9 emission line , which is unusual for normal type  iip supernovae at late times . </S>",
    "<S> we detect the supernova in archival spitzer and wise images obtained @xmath10  months after explosion , which show clear signs of warm ( @xmath11  k ) dust emission . </S>",
    "<S> the dwarf irregular host galaxy , eso  302@xmath014 , has a low gas - phase oxygen abundance , @xmath12 ( @xmath13  z@xmath8 ) , similar to those of the smc and the hosts of long gamma - ray bursts and luminous core - collapse supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> this metallicity is one of the lowest among local ( @xmath14  mpc ) supernova hosts . </S>",
    "<S> we study the host environment using galex far - uv , @xmath15-band , and h@xmath9 images and find that the supernova occurred in a large star - formation complex . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology of the h@xmath9 emission appears as a large shell ( @xmath16  pc ) surrounding the fuv and optical emission . </S>",
    "<S> using the h@xmath9-to - fuv ratio , and fuv and @xmath15-band luminosities , we estimate an age of @xmath17  myr and a total mass of @xmath18  m@xmath8 for the star - formation complex , assuming a single - age starburst . </S>",
    "<S> these properties are consistent with the expanding h@xmath9 supershells observed in many well - studied nearby dwarf galaxies , which are tell - tale signs of feedback from the cumulative effect of massive star winds and supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> the age estimated for the star - forming region where sn  2008jb exploded suggests a relatively high - mass progenitor star with initial mass @xmath19  m@xmath8 , and warrants further study . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of these findings in the study of core - collapse supernova progenitors . </S>"
