    "the problem of studying qcd at nonzero chemical potential is at the crux of nuclear physics .",
    "if reliable methods could be developed for doing this , then one could study cold nuclear matter at zero pressure ( which is not a bad caricature of the interiors of real nuclei ) as well as matter under extreme conditions which may be relevant in astrophysics or heavy ion reactions .",
    "the ultimate purpose of this paper is to begin to explore the implications of the large @xmath0 limit of qcd to this problem .",
    "large @xmath0 qcd has proven to be a useful tool to gain insights into hadronic physics and thus it is reasonable to suppose that it may prove similarly useful to study qcd with a chemical potential@xcite .    before proceeding",
    ", it should be noted that the applicability of large @xmath0 qcd to problems in the nuclear physics domain such as nuclear matter may be quite problematic due to the relevant scales in the problem . in a formal large",
    "@xmath0 expansion one organizes things only by factors @xmath2 .",
    "this is clearly useful if @xmath0 is large enough and if all of the coefficients multiplying the @xmath2 factors are `` natural '' . however",
    ", if there are a wide variety of scales in the problem which have an origin different from @xmath2 physics , it may well be that the @xmath2 expansion does not do a good job of organizing the physics into a hierarchy of scales amenable to expansion .",
    "in fact , in nuclear physics many important scales are much smaller than typical hadronic scales for reasons which have nothing to do with large @xmath0 physics .",
    "for example , the binding of two nucleons is formally of order @xmath4 .",
    "however , the binding of the deepest bound two - nucleon state is the deuteron at @xmath5 mev .",
    "this is two - order magnitude smaller than the nucleon - delta mass splitting ( @xmath6 mev ) which is of order @xmath2 .",
    "thus one might reasonably worry that the vastly different scales in the problem presumably make the large @xmath0 expansion useless for quantitative or semi - quantitative studies of nuclear physics .",
    "given this caution , one might conclude that it is pointless to use large @xmath0 methods in the nuclear domain",
    ". however , this would be hasty . in the first place",
    ", there may be problems for which the scales present in nuclear physics do not mix strongly with hadronic scales and which may lead to a useful expansion quantitatively .",
    "studies of the nucleon - nucleon potential in large @xmath0 show that the patterns of large and small spin - isospin terms in the potential are consistent with results from straightforward @xmath2 counting@xcite .",
    "moreover , even if the large @xmath0 expansion turns out to be of little utility quantitatively it can be used to answer questions of principle .",
    "for example , the question of whether the nucleon - nucleon force is consistent with a meson - exchange picture can be studied in the large @xmath0 context@xcite .",
    "the issue is nontrivial since diagrams associated with multi - meson exchange are powers of @xmath0 larger than the allowed total value .",
    "however , cancellations occur between classes of such diagrams to yield results consistent with the standard @xmath0 counting . in a similar way",
    "one might hope to gain qualitative insight into qcd at non - zero chemical potential .",
    "this problem is of practical importance in nuclear physics .",
    "there is also an underlying theoretical mystery . at zero temperature",
    "the baryon density is strictly zero if the absolute value of the chemical potential is less than the critical value to make nuclear matter .",
    "however , from the perspective of the functional integral it is quite unclear _",
    "why _ the density is zero .",
    "this problem has been dubbed the silver blaze problem@xcite after the arthur conan doyle story `` silver blaze '' in which the key clue is a dog _ not _ barking in the night . resolving",
    "this problem is of potential importance since understanding how nuclear matter forms for chemical potential greater than this critical value presumably depends on understanding how it does nt form below .",
    "it is plausible that large @xmath0 qcd can give insight into this issue of principle .",
    "one possible way to gain such insight into the problem of qcd at a finite baryon chemical potential is to compare qcd with an equal chemical potential for up and down quarks ( which will yield symmetric nuclear matter ) to qcd with chemical potentials for up and down quarks which are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign ( which makes `` isospin matter '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , a pion condensate at low densities ) .",
    "one reason to focus on this comparison is that the isospin matter case is well understood at low densities .",
    "firstly , at a phenomenological level this problem is amenable to treatment using chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "secondly , the analogous isospin silver blaze has been solved : the relevant configurations which contribute to the functional integral have functional determinants equal to their zero chemical potential value for all chemical potentials less than the critical value ( which is a chemical potential per quark of @xmath3)@xcite .",
    "thus if we can understand the difference between the baryon chemical potential case and the analogous isospin case , we can understand the baryon case .",
    "at a formal level these two systems are quite similar , but at a phenomenological level they are very different and our goal is to understand this difference .    on first sight",
    "it seems plausible that large @xmath0 qcd might provide import insights into the differences between the two systems .",
    "indeed , a simple diagrammatic analysis parallel to the original analysis of  t hooft ( done for the zero chemical potential case)@xcite yields the result that the density of up quarks depends only on the up quark chemical potential while the density of down quarks depends only on the down quark chemical potential plus corrections which are suppressed at large @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that baryon matter with a certain chemical potential per quark has the same magnitude of quark density for up and down quarks as isospin matter of the same chemical potential : the only difference being that in the isospin case one of the flavors has a negative density .",
    "a simple way to understand this is that large @xmath0 qcd is quenched : in quenched qcd quark properties are only affected by their propagators and not via the functional determinants so there is no way for the chemical potential for one flavor of quark to affect the behavior of a quark of a different flavor .",
    "however , this is at odds with known phenomenology . at zero temperature",
    ", the critical value for the isospin chemical potential goes to zero in the chiral limit while the critical value of the baryon chemical potential presumably does not .",
    "thus , a simple large @xmath0 analysis of the problem does not resolve the problem of interest , rather it yields a new puzzle : namely , why does the simple ",
    "t hooft type analysis fail ?    the immediate goal of this paper is to attempt to resolve this problem : before the general behavior of qcd at finite baryon chemical potential can be understood , this issue must be dealt with .",
    "this paper explores a scenario which appears to provide a natural resolution to the problem ",
    "the @xmath2 expansion breaks down due to infrared effects associated with spontaneous breaking of u(1 ) isospin symmetry ( associated with the third component ) which thereby invalidates the  t hooft type diagrammatic analysis . despite its simplicity this explanation raises some interesting and subtle theoretical issues .",
    "indeed , on its face this resolution immediately poses new problems .",
    "one problem concerns the nature of the break down of the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "a taylor expansion breaks down when it enters a regime in which it ceases to converge .",
    "this does not appear to be the nature of the breakdown here ",
    "one can be in a regime in which both the isospin matter case and the baryon matter case are well described by taylor series in @xmath2 and yet they do not agree with each other .",
    "the fact that they are well described by a converged series suggests that the expansion has not broken down , yet the fact that they give distinct answers suggests that it has .",
    "what is going on ?",
    "a second problem involves the behavior of the system at small , but nonzero temperatures and small chemical potentials . in this regime one can use chiral perturbation theory to compute the densities and by explicit computation it can be seen that the isospin chemical case differs radically from the baryon chemical potential case despite the fact that the large @xmath0 analysis says they should both be equal at leading order",
    "this is apparently in contradiction to the overall resolution of the paradox : in this regime there is no phase transition and hence no apparent reason why the @xmath2 expansion breaks down . as will be discussed in detail in this paper these apparent problems",
    "can also be resolved and reconciled with the simple explanation given above .",
    "there is an additional problem with the scenario and that relates to the quenched approximation to qcd .",
    "lattice simulations show that quenched qcd incorrectly gives the critical point for the baryon chemical potential qualitatively ( at a chemical potential per quark of @xmath3)@xcite .",
    "since the diagrammatic analysis implies that the large @xmath0 limit of qcd _ is _ quenched , the known behavior of quenched qcd suggests that whatever problem exists at large @xmath0 , it is associated with the baryon number case and not the isospin case .",
    "this seems to be at odds with the general resolutions since it is the isospin chemical potential which leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "there is a plausible way to evade this difficulty  that quenched qcd undergoes a phase transition at a chemical potential per quark of @xmath3 associated with breaking a symmetry which is not present in full qcd . in this picture ,",
    "quenched qcd with a baryon chemical potential behaves analogously to qcd with an isospin chemical potential .",
    "however , as will be discussed in detail this explanation is problematic when viewed at a diagrammatic level .    the difficulties associated with a diagrammatic description of quenched qcd raises doubts about the scenario presented here .",
    "it is plausible , however , that the problem is associated with peculiarities of quenched qcd ( which , after all is not even a physical theory ) .",
    "if this is the case , then the explanation outlined here may well be correct .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the underlying theoretical differences between the two systems ( qcd with isospin chemical potential and qcd with a baryon chemical potential ) is briefly reviewed as is the phenomenology of the two cases . in the following section ,",
    "a simple large @xmath0 analysis based on diagrammatics is given which yields the prediction that baryon matter with a certain chemical potential per quark has the same magnitude of quark density for up and down quarks as isospin matter of the same chemical potential .",
    "this is the principal problem addressed here .",
    "next comes a section discussing how a phase transition associated with pion condensation appears to resolve this problem and various theoretical issues associated with this resolution .",
    "the final section discusses the challenges to the scenario posed by quenched qcd .",
    "for simplicity the problem will be studied in the limit of unbroken isospin so the up and down quark masses will be taken as degenerate and electromagnetic effects ignored .",
    "the problem is most easily expressed in terms of qcd with a separate chemical potential for up and down quarks ; that is , consider a system whose lagrangian is given by @xmath7 with lagrangian one can evaluate the partition function  at least in principle  and from the partition function one can compute the free energy density : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the spatial volume of the system and @xmath10 .",
    "the densities of the two species of quark are given by @xmath11 two important cases can be distinguished  a baryon matter ( _ eg .",
    "_ nuclear matter ) for which @xmath12 and isospin matter ( _ eg .",
    "_ , a pion condensate for @xmath13 ) : @xmath14 the focus of this paper is on the difference between @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the large @xmath0 limit of qcd .    as seen in ref .",

    "the standard boundary conditions are imposed : periodic for the gluons and anti - periodic for the fermions with an extension in the time direction of @xmath10 .",
    "note in the expression for @xmath21 the functional determinant is squared ( one for each flavor ) while for the first form for @xmath22 the chemical potential for the two flavors is opposite . the second form for @xmath22 exploits the identity @xmath23 which",
    "can easily be proved @xcite .    comparing the second form for @xmath22 with the form for @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ zff])and the fact that @xmath24 is real and positive , one sees that the only difference between the two is the phase of the functional determinant in the integrand .",
    "thus , the entire difference between the phenomenology of nuclear matter from isospin matter ( a pion condensate ) stems from this phase . as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite the fact that @xmath25 allows one to deduce in an _ a priori _ way that @xmath26 .",
    "the issue of relevance in this paper is whether large @xmath0 qcd allows us to deduce anything else about the relationship between @xmath18 and @xmath17 .    before turning to the large @xmath0 limit it is useful to review what is known about the phenomenology of baryon matter and isospin matter . here",
    "the focus will be on the zero temperature case .",
    "there are two reasons for this focus .",
    "the first is simply because the silver blaze problem only arises at zero temperature .",
    "the second is the analysis in this paper will ultimately be done in the large @xmath0 limit where one expects the general phenomena of large @xmath0 continuum reduction to apply @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite large @xmath0 continuum reduction means that at large @xmath0 the expectation of an operator will be independent of temperature for all temperatures below some critical value .",
    "thus it is sufficient to study the @xmath27 case to understand the full low temperature behavior at large @xmath0 .",
    "first consider the case of isospin matter . at low chemical potential",
    "one expects that the system remains in the vacuum state for chemical potentials less than @xmath3 , which is the critical point since the pion is the state with the smallest mass per unit isospin in qcd . at @xmath28",
    "there will be a second - order phase transition to a dilute pion condensate whose density then grows with @xmath29 . the system can be analyzed in chiral perturbation theory@xcite at tree level and the up and down quark densities are given by    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is a typical hadronic scale ( for example @xmath32 ) . from eq .",
    "( [ pheni ] ) it is apparent that if one can neglect the higher order terms in the chiral expansion , then there is a second - order transition as a function of @xmath29 with a critical @xmath29 of @xmath3 ; there is no discontinuity in the density at the critical point . on very general grounds the higher - order terms",
    "are not expected to destroy this qualitative picture : there will be a second - order transition at @xmath28 .",
    "the case of baryon matter is quite different .",
    "the transition as a function of @xmath29 is first order at @xmath27 .",
    "below a critical value of the chemical potential the density is zero . immediately above this value",
    "the density is given by the saturation density of nuclear matter @xmath33 .",
    "the critical chemical potential is given by @xmath34 where @xmath0 , the number of colors , is three for the physical world , @xmath35 is the nucleon mass and @xmath36 is the binding energy per nucleon of saturated nuclear matter which is estimated to be approximately 16 mev .",
    "these properties of baryon matter can be easily inferred from the extrapolation of the properties of finite nuclei@xcite .",
    "it is apparent that the behavior of the two systems is completely different .",
    "the order of the transition is different as is the critical chemical potential .",
    "perhaps more striking than the numerical differences in the critical chemical potentials are the qualitative ones : in the isospin case the critical chemical potential is of a chiral origin and goes to zero as the quark masses go to zero ; this is not true in the baryon case . clearly , the single sign difference in eq .",

    "all diagrams not in these classes are lower order in the expansion .",
    "the classes are specified by topology .",

    "can _ be drawn in the topology indicated . [",
    "cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the study of large @xmath0 qcd began with ",
    "t hooft s seminal work @xcite .",
    "the key theoretical tool introduced in this was a classification of perturbative qcd diagrams into classes according to their @xmath0 scaling .",
    "the assumptions underlying this classification are very simple : the quarks are taken to be in the fundamental representation of su(@xmath0 ) while the gluons are in the adjoint ; the coupling constant is taken to scale as @xmath37 while the quark mass is taken to scale as @xmath38 .",
    "these rules ensure a smooth large @xmath0 limit for mesonic properties .",
    "the analysis is greatly simplified by exploiting the fact that color content of a color adjoint gluon is essentially that of a fundamental - antifundamental bilinear with a color singlet contribution removed . however",
    ", this color singlet combination is a @xmath39 effect so that at leading order and next - to - leading order as far as color counting is concerned the gluon acts like a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "this is beautifully encoded via the introduction of  t hooft s double line representation for the gluons representing the color flow ( the fundamental and anti - fundamental indices have flow in opposite directions ) .",
    "the quarks are represented by single lines representing the flow of the color in the fundamental representation .",
    "color conservation requires that the color entering a vertex must leave it ; thus all color lines eventually form closed loops .",
    "the @xmath0 counting of a diagram is then given by a factor of @xmath0 for each closed color loop and a factor of @xmath37 for every coupling constant .",
    "the results of this analysis are well known and summarized in table [ t ] .",
    "the issue of what modifications are needed to this analysis of the counting rules when a chemical potential is included is critical here .",
    "however , it can be dealt with trivially : formally the analysis of the scaling goes through without modification , provided that the chemical potential is of order @xmath38 .",
    "the reason for this is straightforward : the chemical potential enters a diagram only via the quark propagator .",
    "if the quark mass and the chemical potential are each of order @xmath38 , then the quark propagator itself is also of order @xmath38 .",
    "since the inclusion of a chemical potential of order unity does not alter the @xmath0 dependence of the propagator , its inclusion does not alter the @xmath0 dependence of the diagrams and table [ t ] continues to apply .    in order to use this topological classification of diagrams to deduce the @xmath0 scaling properties of physical observables",
    ", an additional assumption must be made .",
    "namely , that the leading @xmath0 for some quantity is fixed by the @xmath0 counting of the lowest - order class of graphs which can contribute to the quantity in a perturbative expansion . this assumption is nontrivial since a theory need not be equivalent to the perturbative expansion summed to all orders ; intrinsically nonperturbative phenomena can contribute and _ a priori _ there is no guarantee that nonperturbative contributions will follow the same @xmath0 scaling laws as the perturbative ones .",
    "however , this assumption has worked well for the case of zero chemical potential in the sense that there are no known cases where intrinsically nonperturbative contradictions spoil the @xmath0 scaling based on diagrammatics .",
    "it seems reasonable as a tentative first step in the study of nonzero chemical potentials to make the same assumption .",
    "the free energy is simply the sum of all connected diagrams ( assuming that the resummed perturbative expansion is equivalent to the theory ) .",
    "the dependence of the free energy on the chemical potential requires the contribution of at least one quark loop . from table [ t ] , it is apparent that the leading class of diagrams containing at least one quark loop are the one - loop diagrams where the quark loop bounds the diagram and contributes at order @xmath4 ; two - quark - loop contributions are at least one order down in @xmath0 .",
    "since the gluons are flavor neutral , one - quark - loop diagrams are either loops with up quarks or down quarks ( the contributions of heavier quark loops are neglected since the focus is on the dependence of the up and down quark chemical potential . )",
    "this implies that the @xmath29-dependent part of the free energy density at leading order in the expansion is given by @xmath40 the first term on the right - hand side is the sum of the one - up - quark loop contributions while the second term represents the one - down - quark loops .",
    "note that functions @xmath41 for the up - quark and down - quark contributions are identical due to isospin invariance .",
    "the overall factor of @xmath0 follows from the scaling rule seen in table [ t ] .",
    "it is easy to see why eq .",
    "( [ form ] ) must hold  the large @xmath0 limit of qcd is quenched .",
    "this implies that the contribution of the two flavors must be independent  the up quark density , for example , can not depend on the down quark chemical potential .",
    "this independence is encoded in eq .",
    "( [ form ] ) .",
    "the apparent phenomenological consequences of eq .",
    "( [ form ] ) are quite stark . combining eqs .",
    "( [ form ] ) and ( [ dif ] ) yields @xmath42 it is easy to see that @xmath43 must be an even function of @xmath29 if the @xmath2 expansion holds .",
    "@xmath44 is given by eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "however , cpt implies that @xmath45 since anti - nuclear matter has the same mass as nuclear matter .",
    "this immediately implies that if @xmath2 corrections can be neglected , then @xmath46 .",
    "however , if @xmath47 is even , then eq .  ( [ b ] ) implies that @xmath48 equation ( [ para ] ) states that the free energy of baryonic matter is identical to that of isospin matter at the same chemical potential plus @xmath2 corrections .",
    "it is at the core of the paradox : as discussed in sec .",
    "[ bg ] , at a phenomenological level the two systems are radically different yet the @xmath2 expansion suggests that their differences should be small .",
    "the resolution to this paradox , presumably either resides in the theoretical analysis or in the phenomenological description .    superficially , the logic underlying the analysis in the previous section was identical to that used by ",
    "t hooft in the zero chemical potential case where the analysis does appear to be reliable .",
    "thus , it is prudent to first focus on the possibility that phenomenology as being the culprit . _ a priori _ this may not seem to be too implausible .",
    "after all , as discussed in the introduction , the large @xmath0 limit of qcd can easily fail for nuclear phenomena given the very small characteristic scales involved .",
    "thus , one might hope that eq .",
    "( [ para ] ) holds formally ; this would imply that the fundamental problem is simply that the @xmath2 corrections swamp the leading term .",
    "this would make nuclear matter very different from isospin matter .",
    "this resolution to the paradox amounts to the assertion that if we only lived in a truly large @xmath0 world ( say @xmath49 rather than @xmath50 ) , isospin matter and nuclear matter at the same chemical potential would have virtually the same density .",
    "however , this phenomenological resolution to the paradox is almost certainly not correct .",
    "note that for the isospin case there is a second - order transition at @xmath28 for @xmath27 . for eq .",
    "( [ para ] ) to hold in a large @xmath0 world the critical chemical potential for the baryon case would also have to be @xmath28 and thus tend to zero in the chiral limit . for this to occur one would have to make nuclear matter which is so deeply bound that the binding energy between nucleons cancels the nucleon s mass .",
    "this is quite far fetched since the nucleon mass appears to have nothing to do with the chiral limit .",
    "it is even more far fetched when one considers the second - order nature of the transition .",
    "the density at @xmath29 just above the transition in the isospin case can be made arbitrarily small so that eq .",
    "( [ para ] ) implies that the baryon density would also be arbitrarily small just above the transition .",
    "however , if the density in the baryon case is dilute then the nucleon - nucleon interactions would be small and thus could not cancel the nucleon mass .",
    "having disposed of the phenomenological resolution , one is forced to conclude that eq .",
    "( [ para ] ) is wrong and , hence , so is the theoretical justification underlying it .",
    "the issue then becomes identifying what is wrong with the standard @xmath2 analysis of the diagrams , which as we have noted is identical to that used by ",
    "t hooft at zero chemical potential . in attempting to resolve this",
    "theoretically there are a number of issues that appear to complicate the analysis .",
    "the first is that there is no obvious breakdown of the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "if we concentrate on @xmath51 and @xmath52 and imagine writing them both as taylor series in @xmath2 , there is no indication that the series breaks down for either quantity .",
    "consider , for example , the regime @xmath27 , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is given in eq .",
    "( [ mu0 ] ) . in this regime",
    "the @xmath51 is strictly zero .",
    "thus @xmath51 is accurately described by a taylor series in @xmath2 with all terms zero . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath52 is finite and for small enough values of @xmath29 and @xmath55 can be arbitrarily well described by eq .",
    "( [ pheni ] ) .",
    "since this regime is supposed to be the regime of validity of chiral perturbation theory , one expects that a systematic series in pion loops is possible since the chiral expansion organizes into a loop expansion for pion contributions .",
    "however , the loop expansion for meson is also the @xmath2 expansion and hence one expects that if the chiral expansion is legitimate so is the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "this suggests that , at least in this regime , a @xmath2 expansion is valid for both quantities of interest .",
    "this poses a problem since we expect that the most plausible theoretical explanation of the difference between @xmath56 and @xmath44 is due to a breakdown of the @xmath2 expansion ; if the expansion does not break down , they must agree up to @xmath2 corrections .",
    "a second issue is associated with the regime of low temperatures and small chemical potentials : @xmath57 where , at least formally @xmath29 , @xmath58 and @xmath55 are taken to be of order @xmath38 . in this regime , chiral symmetry implies that the system behaves as a gas of weakly interacting pions from which one can directly compute the free energy density of isospin matter : @xmath59 thus we see that the free energy density in this regime , though small , is formally of order @xmath38 .",
    "this should be contrasted to the baryon free energy which , in this regime , is exponentially small in a @xmath2 sense @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the two free energies continue to differ in this regime .",
    "the significance of the behavior in this regime becomes clear if one studies @xmath16 as a function of @xmath29 at fixed but small @xmath58 . equation ( [ r2 ] ) shows explicitly that in this regime there is no discontinuity as a function of @xmath29 all the way down to @xmath1 ; in the regime under consideration there is no phase transition to a pion condensate .",
    "however , since the problem of isospin matter not matching baryon matter persists in this regime it suggests that the phase transition is not the origin of the problem .",
    "these issues appear to suggest that the problem is not associated with a breakdown of the @xmath2 expansion for the free energies , and is not associated with a discontinuity of the free energy as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "however , it will be argued here that the cause of the problem is with the description of the isospin matter system , and is caused by a breakdown of the @xmath2 expansion which , in turn , is associated with a phase transition .    recall the crux of the problem .",
    "a diagrammatic analysis at large @xmath0 implies that at leading orders the two quark flavors do not `` talk to '' each other : down quark observables do not depend on the up quarks and vice versa . if they do depend on each other at leading order , than the expansion has broken down",
    "this is precisely what occurs for the case of isospin matter . to see this ,",
    "let us return to the regime with @xmath27 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 is a typical hadronic scale",
    ". in this regime one can directly compute properties of isospin matter using a lowest - order lagrangian working at tree level .",
    "this analysis was originally carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite and was the basis for eq .",
    "( [ pheni ] ) .",
    "the important thing here is that in this regime there is a pion condensate which can be computed easily .",

    "this explanation is both simple and natural .",
    "however , it appears to be in conflict with the arguments presented above .",
    "thus , it is important to understand just how these arguments can be evaded .",

    "how then can one argue that a breakdown in the @xmath2 expansion for @xmath56 to cause it to differ from @xmath44 as implied by the diagrammatic @xmath2 expansion ?",
    "the answer lies in the possibility that there are multiple regimes in the problem , each with a valid @xmath2 expansion but which are not connected with each other due to a breakdown of the @xmath2 expansion at the boundary of the regimes .",
    "specifically , the scenario is that there is a well - defined taylor expansion in @xmath2 for @xmath56 in the regime @xmath71 and another well - defined but disconnected expansion for @xmath61 . in this scenario",
    ", the regime for @xmath72 behaves according to the large @xmath0 behavior as deduced from the diagrammatic analysis ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath73 plus possible higher order corrections ) . in the regime where @xmath61 ( for @xmath27 )",
    ", @xmath56 still possesses a @xmath2 expansion but it is a different expansion than that given by the diagrammatic analysis of  t hooft .",
    "this is possible only if there is no smooth way to connect the series for the two regimes due to a breakdown of the expansion on the boundary @xmath28 .",
    "as it happens , the series in @xmath2 for @xmath56 _ does _ break down at the boundary between these two regimes .",
    "note from eq .",
    "( [ pheni ] ) , that the expression contains a smooth function of @xmath29 times a step function at @xmath74 .",

    "( [ piexp ] ) and a subsequent taylor expansion .",
    "@xmath78    the series clearly breaks down at the point @xmath79 since the second term is a divergent @xmath80 function .",
    "thus , the scenario in which there is a well - defined @xmath2 expansion in the symmetry broken phase  but a different @xmath2 expansion than in the unbroken phase  is viable .",
    "next , let us consider the second issue , namely , the behavior of the system in the regime of low temperatures and small chemical potentials , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath57 .",
    "the apparent problem arises since formally @xmath29 , @xmath58 and @xmath55 are of order @xmath38 .",
    "equation ( [ r2 ] ) , however , shows that in this regime , isospin matter has a finite free energy density as @xmath81 while baryon matter has zero free energy density .",
    "this is in apparent conflict with the large @xmath0 expectation based on diagrammatics seen in eq .",
    "( [ form ] ) .",
    "however , it is also clear that the problem is not associated with a phase transition to a pion condensed phase since no such transition occurs in this regime .",
    "this , in turn , appears to contradict the claim made above that the failure of the large @xmath0 analysis is due to such a phase transition .",
    "in fact , there is no contradiction . while it is true that isospin matter and baryon matter do differ in this regime , the differences  although of relative order 100%are , in fact , subleading in the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "the standard @xmath2 counting yields a number density and a free energy density of order @xmath4 for chemical potentials of order unity .",
    "this can be seen straightforwardly from the  t hooft analysis ",
    "the leading order is one loop and hence proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is seen explicitly , for example , in eq .",
    "( [ pheni ] ) : the standard scaling rules @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 yield densities and free energy densities of order @xmath4 when they are non - zero .",
    "however , the same scaling rules applied to eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) gives @xmath85 .",
    "thus , in the regime considered here , both the isospin case and the baryon case have free energies which are zero at order @xmath4 .",
    "they differ from each other at order @xmath38 ( _ i.e. _ , at the first subleading order ) which is exactly what one expects from the diagrammatic analysis .",
    "the behavior seen here in going from zero to finite temperature with no effect on the leading order large @xmath0 behavior illustrates a rather general feature of large @xmath0 qcd and is related to the general phenomena of large @xmath0 continuum reduction@xcite .",
    "the unusual feature in the case of the free energy density of isospin matter is that at zero temperature the observable is strictly zero while at non - zero temperature the observable is non - zero but still subleading .    while the explanation given in this section here is rather natural there remain some important open questions associated with this scenario .",
    "since the essence of the original paradox was seen in a diagrammatic analysis , a complete resolution of the issue requires an understanding of the issue in terms of diagrams .",
    "however , the resolution to the problem as given above  while very plausible  does not make clear precisely which class of diagrams play a role at leading order in @xmath2 .",
    "consider , for example , qcd with an isospin chemical potential .",
    "the scenario outlined here  that there are two distinct @xmath2 expansions , one valid for @xmath86 and one for @xmath87 with the expansions breaking down for @xmath28should be describable in terms of diagrams .",
    "the diagrams which contribute at large @xmath0 in the regime @xmath86 are presumably the same set which occur for @xmath1 : one quark loop graphs with planar gluons and the quark loop bounding the graph . however , above the phase transition our explanation requires a larger set of graphs to contribute at leading order . the argument associated with fig .",
    "[ loops ] implies that in the broken phase a divergent @xmath66 implies that even infinitesimal perturbations with the appropriate quantum numbers can lead to leading - order response .",
    "additional quark loops can couple with these quantum numbers ; although the overall strength associated with adding a loop is suppressed by @xmath2 they can nevertheless yield leading order results due to infrared enhancements .",
    "there is , however , an important open question associated with this , namely , just which class of diagrams does contribute at leading order in this regime ?",
    "a plausible conjecture is that all graphs with planar glue and with an arbitrary number of closed quark loops bounding forming an inner boundary of the graph ( _ i.e _ , with no glue inside the graph ) .",
    "this is plausible in that it builds in all of the standard @xmath2 rules that hold generally , except for the quark loop rule ( which we know to be violated in this regime )",
    ".    a parenthetical remark may be useful here : the leading order graphs containing quarks for @xmath1 are conventionally expressed as single quark loops with all of the ( planar ) glue on the inside . however , as feynman graphs these are identical to single quark loops with all of the ( planar ) glue on the outside .",
    "the important point is simply that they bound the graph .",
    "however , if one wants to generalize to a situation with multiple quark loops , the only topological way to have all of the loops bound the graph is to have the glue on the exterior of the quark loops .",
    "it is not immediately apparent , however , if this conjecture is correct . nor is there an obvious and straightforward way to verify it .",
    "thus , determining whether the conjectured class of diagrams for this regime is correct is an important open question .",
    "a second open question concerns the regime of finite baryon chemical potential .",
    "the explanation given here suggests that the standard diagrammatic treatment for large @xmath0 qcd as done for @xmath1 ( planar graphs with a single quark loop bounding the graph ) remains valid at least up to the phase transition where nuclear matter is formed ( which occurs at @xmath88 ) .",
    "what class of diagrams contributes in the nuclear matter regime ?",
    "at present we do not know .",
    "indeed , the general question of how qcd nuclear matter behaves at large @xmath0 is at present unanswered .",
    "we do not know , for example , if the transition as a function of @xmath29 at @xmath27 is first order ( as in the case of @xmath50 ) or second order .",
    "the need to develop reliable theoretical tools to study qcd with a baryon chemical potential near the transition to nuclear matter is paramount to any attempt in understanding nuclear physics from qcd .",
    "one may hope that large @xmath0 qcd will ultimately provide insight into this problem , but at present we lack the tools even to study large @xmath0 qcd in this regime .    to summarize this section : a natural explanation of the different behavior of large @xmath0 qcd with a baryon chemical potential from large @xmath0 qcd with an isospin chemical potential is due to a breakdown of the @xmath2 expansion for qcd with an isospin chemical potential at the point where a pion condensation phase transition occurs .",
    "the two issues raised in this section which suggested difficulties for such an explanation are apparently reconciled with it .",
    "however , there remain open questions of how the system ought to be described diagrammatically in the symmetry broken regimes .",
    "the behavior of quenched qcd with a baryon chemical potential raises issues in many ways quite analogous to those of qcd with an isospin chemical potential .",
    "thus , if the scenario given in the previous section is correct , one would expect a similar scenario to apply for quenched qcd . as we will see in this section , the behavior of quenched qcd raises challenges to this scenario .",
    "recall the essence of the argument of sec .",
    "[ dia ] that qcd is quenched at leading order large @xmath0 , at least in a diagrammatic analysis .",
    "however , it is long been known that quenched qcd at non - zero baryon chemical potential gives perverse results . in lattice studies of quenched qcd",
    ", the critical baryon chemical potential was found to be at @xmath3 and not at @xmath54.@xcite as @xmath29 exceeds @xmath3 there is evidence that the chiral condensate changes nonanalytically and that the baryon density discontinuously increases from zero .",
    "thus a description of baryon matter based on quenched qcd with a baryon chemical potential appears to be completely wrong : in full qcd the chiral condensate remains at its vacuum value and the baryon density remains zero until @xmath88 .",
    "this immediately poses a challenge to the explanation in sec .",
    "[ pr ] since it suggests that the problem lies with the treatment of baryon matter and not with isospin matter .    to see why , note that the qualitative difference between quenched qcd and full qcd at non - zero chemical potential may be viewed as another symptom of the same basic problem seen in the comparison of baryon matter and isospin  a diagrammatic large @xmath0 analysis fails .",
    "one can consider both full and quenched qcd at any @xmath0 .",
    "presumably the two descriptions remain qualitatively different at all @xmath0 with the transition for quenched qcd occurring at @xmath28 and full qcd well above this ( since there is nothing special about @xmath50 where lattice simulations for quenched qcd were done ) . on the other hand",
    ", a diagrammatic analysis says that the baryon density in large @xmath0 qcd should become equivalent to the density in quenched large @xmath0 qcd since all extra quark loops cost a suppression factor of @xmath2 .",
    "the fact that the two differ , seems to be completely analogous to the fact that baryon matter and isospin matter differ despite being equivalent at the diagrammatic limit . clearly , isospin matter plays no role in this problem and thus the origin of the difficulty here can not be a phase transition in isospin matter .",
    "since the original problem ( an isospin chemical potential versus a baryon chemical potential ) and this one ( full versus quenched qcd with a baryon chemical potential ) have one thing in common  full qcd with a baryon chemical potential ",
    "it is natural to guess that the problem lies there .",
    "the behavior of quenched qcd might be reconciled with our explanation of the difference between isospin matter and baryon matter if quenched qcd undergoes a phase transition at finite baryon chemical potential in a manner analogous to the breaking in isospin matter . however",
    ", this transition can not be associated with the breaking of a standard baryon number u(1 ) symmetry , since then one would be faced with the questions of why the transition occurs at @xmath3 and why the transition does not occur in full qcd .",
    "if one views quenched qcd as merely a prescription to evaluate functional integrals with the functional determinant set to unity , it is hard to see how this possibility could be realized .",
    "however , this prescriptive interpretation of quenched qcd has a major drawback : the physical quantities of interest are not obtained by differentiating a generating functional with respect to sources  as one does with legitimate quantum field theories .",
    "if one formulates quenched qcd in terms of a field theory with a generating functional then one can see how such a symmetry breaking could come about . to do",
    "this one starts with full qcd and then adds a new set of particles : for each quark one adds an associated bosonic quark ( a colored spin-1/2 particle with bosonic commutation relations ) with the same mass and chemical potential as the original quarks@xcite .",
    "these boson quarks , are generally denoted as @xmath89 .",
    "of course , since these fields violate the spin and statistic theorem , their inclusion leads to some clearly unphysical consequences such as states with negative norm .",
    "although the theory is physically nonsensical in these ways , one can treat it as a problem in mathematical physics still computed in the usual way .",
    "the bosonic quarks can be formally integrated out of the functional integral and contribute a factor @xmath90 to the integrand of the gluonic functional integral while the corresponding quark contributes a factor @xmath91 .",
    "the product cancels and thus the usual quark fermion determinant is replaced by unity  this is standard quenching .",
    "the key issue here is that the inclusion of bosonic quarks implies new symmetries for the system and such symmetries can break leading to a phase transition .",
    "if quenched qcd does undergo a phase transition ( associated with the breaking of one of these new symmetries ) when the baryon chemical potential reaches @xmath3 , the difference between full and quenched qcd at large @xmath0 appears to be easy to understand .",
    "in essence , quenched qcd with a baryon chemical potential then behaves analogously to full qcd with an isospin chemical potential : the naive @xmath2 expansion breaking down at the transition point .",
    "it was suggested by stephanov on the basis of a random matrix model study that one expects a phase transition associated with the breaking of a symmetry not present in full qcd@xcite . moreover , from first principles one expects quenched qcd to undergo a phase transition at @xmath92 .",
    "the theory has more degrees of freedom than the usual qcd  it has boson quarks as well as ordinary quarks . consider an excitation created by the current @xmath93 the lightest state in the spectrum with these quantum numbers _",
    "i.e. _ the lightest state obtained by @xmath94 acting on the vacuum might be called a `` baryo - pion''it carries nonzero baryon number but in many respects acts like a pion . in particular , one expects a phase transition at the same @xmath29 ( for a baryon chemical potential ) as ordinary pions will condense ( for an isospin chemical potential ) .    to see this , consider the contribution to the susceptibility for the current @xmath94 , namely , @xmath95 from a one fermion loop diagram in quenched qcd with baryon chemical potential @xmath29 and with some particular arrangement of gluon lines .",
    "it is easy to see from the feynman rules that the contribution is identical to the contribution to @xmath66 , the chiral susceptibility defined in eq .",
    "( [ chis ] ) at one fermion loop ( with an isospin chemical potential @xmath29 ) and with the same arrangement of gluon lines ( modulo an overall multiplicative constant ) .",
    "the standard @xmath2 expansion holds for isospin matter in the regime @xmath72 , so the one fermion loop planar graphs should correctly describe @xmath66 for large @xmath0 and @xmath87 .",
    "this means that in this regime @xmath96 is proportional to @xmath66 . since @xmath66 diverges as @xmath97 , so does @xmath96 .",
    "this type of divergence typically signals the onset of a phase transition .",
    "physically one might think of such a transition as the condensation of `` baryo - pions '' .",
    "thus , quenched qcd does have an instability at a ( baryon ) chemical potential of @xmath3 of the sort typically associated with a phase transition .",
    "this instability is presumably associated with the breaking of a symmetry which is not present in full qcd .",
    "the appearance of such a phase transition is what is needed to reconcile the difference of behavior of quenched and full qcd with baryon chemical potential with our overall explanation .",
    "while this state of affairs is encouraging , there remains a troubling unresolved issue : it provides no way to understand the difference between full and quenched qcd with a baryon chemical potential at large @xmath0 from a diagrammatic perspective .",
    "recall that our explanation for the different behavior was that quenched qcd undergoes a phase transition at @xmath28 associated with the breaking of a u(1 ) symmetry which is not present in the full theory .",
    "regardless of the phenomenology , we know that the baryon density in quenched qcd is generically given diagrammatically as the sum of one quark loop graphs with a single insertion of the operator @xmath98 on that loop .",
    "indeed , the essence of quenching is precisely that all quark loops not connected to external currents do not contribute ; they are exactly canceled by bosonic quark loops . in the large @xmath0 limit , only the planar graphs with the quark line bounding the graph contribute .",
    "a potential problem occurs when we consider the regime @xmath99 , where full qcd has not undergone a phase transition . since full",
    "qcd is in the same phase as at nonzero @xmath100 as at @xmath1 , one expects that the naive @xmath2 analysis based on diagrams to hold in this regime : at leading order , the baryon density is given by planar gluons with a single quark loop which bounds the graph ; an insertion of @xmath98 is attached to the quark line .",
    "indeed , the scenario outlined in sec .",
    "[ pr ] is based on this assumption .",
    "however , this is precisely the same set of diagrams that occurs in a calculation of the baryon density in quenched qcd at large @xmath0 regardless of the value of @xmath29 .",
    "thus , in the regime @xmath101 , full and quenched qcd at large @xmath0 appear to have exactly the same diagrams contributing , yet to predict different densities .",
    "the difficulty is that we have no way to understand the differing behaviors from a diagrammatic point of view .",
    "note that the situation is qualitatively different from our scenario for isospin matter at @xmath102 .",
    "in isospin matter the phase transition at @xmath103 implies a new @xmath2 expansion , and associated with this new expansion is a new set of diagrams : those with more than a single quark loop .",
    "however , an analogous behavior can not happen for quenched qcd  by construction , in quenched qcd only single quark loop graphs can contribute .",
    "in this diagrammatic sense , large @xmath0 quenched qcd with a baryon chemical potential is _ not _ analogous to large @xmath0 qcd with an isospin chemical potential .",
    "the upshot of this is that the difference between full and quenched qcd at large @xmath0 and non - zero baryon chemical potential is not fully understood .",
    "the argument analogous to the one used for the isospin case does not resolve the issue at a diagrammatic level .",
    "until this issue is fully resolved one must view the scenario presented in sec .",
    "[ pr ] as being provisional .",
    "while the scenario seems quite plausible when viewed in its own right , the lack of understanding the apparently analogous problem in qcd suggests the possibility of a common explanation for both issues which is presently unknown . of course",
    ", it is also possible that the scenario in sec .",
    "[ pr ] is , in fact , correct and that there are subtle issues associated with quenching which will ultimately explain the puzzle discussed in this section .",
    "this is , perhaps , not too implausible .",
    "quenched qcd , after all , is not a true physical theory and it is quite conceivable that some peculiar feature of it can explain the diagrammatic issue raised in this section while leaving the scenario of sec .",
    "[ pr ] intact . clearly",
