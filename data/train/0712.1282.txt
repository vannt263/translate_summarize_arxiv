    "noise - induced transport play a crucial role in many processes from physical and biological to social systems .",
    "there has been an increasing interest in transport properties of nonlinear systems which can extract usable work from unbiased nonequilibrium fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this comes from the desire of understanding molecular motors @xcite , nanoscale friction @xcite , surface smoothening @xcite , coupled josephson junctions @xcite , optical ratchets and directed motion of laser cooled atoms @xcite , and mass separation and trapping schemes at microscale @xcite .",
    "most studies have referred to the consideration of the energy barriers .",
    "the nature of the energy barriers depends on which thermodynamic potential varies when passing from one well to the other , and its presence plays an important role in the dynamics of the solid - state physics system .",
    "however , in some cases , such as soft condensed - matter and biological systems , the entropic barriers should be considered .",
    "the entropic barriers may appear when coarsening the description of a complex system for simplifying its dynamics .",
    "reguera and co - workers @xcite used the mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics theory to derive the general kinetic equation of a system and analyze in detail the case of diffusion in a domain of irregular geometry in which the presence of the boundaries induces entropic barriers when approaching the dynamics by a coarsening of the description . in the presence of entropic barriers , the asymmetry of the tube",
    "can induce a net current in the absence of any net macroscopic forces or in the presence of the unbiased forces @xcite .",
    "+ in recent years the energetics of these systems , which rectify the zero - mean fluctuations , was investigated .",
    "much of the interest was motivated by the elegant piece of work done by magnasco @xcite , which showed that a brownian particle , subject to external fluctuations , can undergo a non - zero drift while moving under the influence of an asymmetric potential .",
    "he claimed that there is a region where the efficiency can be optimized at a finite temperature and the existence of thermal fluctuations facilitate the efficiency of energy transformation .",
    "his claim is interesting because thermal noise is usually known to disturb the operation of machines .",
    "based on energetic analysis of the same model kamegawa and co - workers @xcite made a important conclusion that the efficiency of energy transformation on the quasistatic limit can not be optimized at finite temperatures and that the thermal fluctuations does not facilitate it .",
    "takagi and hondou@xcite found that thermal noise may facilitate the energy conversion in the forced thermal ratchet when an `` oscillating ratchet '' was considered .",
    "a recent investigation of dan and co - workers @xcite showed that the efficiency can be optimized at a finite temperature in inhomogeneous systems with spatially varying friction coefficient in a forced thermal ratchet .",
    "sumithra and co - workers @xcite studied a homogeneous ratchet driven by a nonadiabatical external periodic force and found that thermal noise can facilitate the energy transformation . when an isothermal ratchet driven by a chemical reaction between the two states , the efficiency can also have a maximum as a function of temperature @xcite . in forced undamped ratchets @xcite , the efficiency optimization can also be found . in two - dimensional ratchet ,",
    "wang and bao @xcite found that the efficiency is peaked function of temperature which is different from that in one - dimensional ratchet .",
    "recently , ghosh and co - workers @xcite investigated the stochastic energetics of direction quantum transport due to rectification of nonequilibrium thermal fluctuations and found that the stokes efficiency reaches a maximum at a particular temperature .",
    "efficiency optimization in forced thermal ratchet usually takes place for fast oscillating or fluctuation forces .",
    "when the force changes very slowly enough , for example a square wave with a very long period , the system can be treated as quasistatic .",
    "when the unbiased force is asymmetry , ai and co - workers @xcite found that the thermal noise can facilitate the energy transformation even on the quasi - static limit .",
    "the previous works on efficiency were on the consideration of the energy barriers .",
    "the present work is extended to the study of efficiency to the case of entropic barriers .",
    "we emphasize on finding whether the thermal noise in the presence of entropic barriers can facilitate the energy transformation even on the quasistatic limit .",

    "<S> efficiency of a brownian particle moving along the axis of a three - dimensional asymmetric periodic channel is investigated in the presence of a symmetric unbiased force and a load . </S>",
    "<S> reduction of the spatial dimensionality from two or three physical dimensions to an effective one - dimensional system entails the appearance of entropic barriers and an effective diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the energetics in the presence of entropic barriers exhibits peculiar behavior which is different from that occurring through energy barriers . </S>",
    "<S> we found that even on the quasistatic limit there is a regime where the efficiency can be a peaked function of temperature , which indicates that thermal noise can facilitate energy transformation , contrary to the case of energy barriers . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of entropic barriers may induce optimized efficiency at a finite temperature . </S>"
