    "in the last decade it became clear that typical processes in many neural and cognitive networks are realized in the form of sequential dynamics ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the dynamics are exhibited as sequential switching among metastable states , each of which represents a collection of simultaneously activated nodes in the network , so that at most instants of time a single state is activated .",
    "such dynamics are consistent with the winner - less competition principle @xcite . in the phase space of a mathematical model of such a system",
    "each state corresponds to an invariant saddle set and the switchings are determined by trajectories joining these invariant sets . in the simplest case these invariant sets may be saddle equilibrium points coupled by heteroclinic trajectories , and they form a heteroclinic sequence ( hs )",
    ". this sequence can be stable if all saddle equilibria have one - dimensional unstable manifolds @xcite , in the sense that there is an open set of initial points such that trajectories going through them follow the heteroclinic ones in the hs , or unstable if some of the unstable manifolds are two - or - more dimensional . in the latter case properties of trajectories in a neighborhood of the hs",
    "were studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "general results on the stability of heteroclinic sequences have been obtained by krupa and melbourne @xcite in the form of necessary conditions that may also be sufficient in the presence of certain algebraic conditions .",
    "an instability of a hs may be caused if some initial conditions follow trajectories on the unstable manifold different from the heteroclinic ones .",
    "m.  rabinovich suggested @xcite considering the case when all trajetories on the unstable manifold of any saddle in a hs are heteroclinic to saddles in the hs , which implies an assumption that the hs is , in fact , a heteroclinic cycle . in this case",
    "one can expect some kind of stability , not of the hs , of course , but of the object in the phase space formed by all heteroclinic trajectories of the saddles in the hs .",
    "we study in our paper the rabinovich problem .",
    "we deal here with the generalized lotka - volterra model @xcite that is a basic model of sequential dynamics for which unstable sets are realized as saddle equilibrium points .",
    "all variables and parameters may take only nonnegative values , so we work in the positive orthant of the phase space @xmath7 .",
    "we impose some restrictions on parameters under which all unstable manifolds of the saddle point are two - dimensional and all trajectories on them ( in the positive orthant ) are heteroclinic in some specific way ( see below ) .",
    "we prove that they form a piece - wise smooth manifold homeomorphic to the cylinder if the number of the saddle points in the hs is even or to the mbius band if it is odd .",
    "we prove also that under the additional assumption that each equilibrium is _ dissipative _ ( see below ) , then this manifold is the maximal attractor for some absorbing region ( in the positive orthant ) .",
    "trajectories in this region may follow different heteroclinic trajectories and may manifest some kind of weak complex behavior .",
    "although our motivations are neurological , we observe that heteroclinic networks ( and thus , potentially , high - dimensional counterparts of the same ) are ubiquitous , appearing in applications that range from celestial dynamics @xcite to evolutionary game theory @xcite .",
    "we begin our consideration of two - dimensional heteroclinic channels with the study of a series of lotka - volterra equations .",
    "lotka - volterra models are widely used in the context of heteroclinic sequences where all the unstable manifolds are one dimensional , so that each equilibrium is connected to exactly one subsequent equilibrium ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has been recently shown that they ask provide a general method for embedding directed graphs into a system of ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "we remark that although @xcite allows graphs of high valency to be modeled by heteroclinic networks , and some work has been done on the stability of such systems ( e.g. @xcite , which considers the competing dynamics of the  overlapping \" channels @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , study of heteroclinic networks has usually only considered one - dimensional unstable manifolds . in keeping with the discussion of the introduction , we consider the dynamics of a system such that initial conditions arbitrarily close to any of @xmath10 saddle nodes may be mapped into neighborhoods of either one of two other saddle nodes . in particular , a simple general model for heteroclinic sequential dynamics was given in @xcite by @xmath11 where all of the parameters are assumed to be positive .",
    "the constants @xmath12 have biological meaning , representing inhibition of mode @xmath13 by mode @xmath14 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume that @xmath15 for all @xmath13 .",
    "further , since the variable @xmath16 is assumed to encode biological information that is necessarily non - negative , e.g.  activation levels or chemical concentrations , we restrict the system to the first closed orthant , @xmath17 .",
    "the system is so constructed that it contains saddle points lying on the axes , with @xmath18 being the @xmath13-th coordinate of the @xmath13-th saddle along the @xmath13-th axis ( @xmath19 ) , i.e. , the system has @xmath20 equilibrium points of the form @xmath21 , for @xmath22 .",
    "there may be other equilibria as well , but they are not relevant for our purposes ; we only study transitions between the @xmath20 equilibria just defined .    in the present work",
    "we suppose that the first @xmath6 equilibria points are sequentially connected by a set of @xmath5-dimensional unstable manifolds . for each @xmath23 , @xmath24 , there will be a heteroclinic orbit connecting @xmath0 to @xmath2 and a heteroclinic orbit connecting @xmath0 to @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the system is closed in the sense that @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath6 is the modulus of the subscript . in the following , we will consider the restrictions necessary to enforce such dynamics .    , with @xmath26 . ]    to ensure that there are heteroclinic trajectories between @xmath0 and both @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we apply eigenvalue conditions to the system .",
    "consider first @xmath27 .",
    "the linearization of the vector field @xmath28 at @xmath27 is given by the upper triangular matrix : @xmath29 and so the eigenvalues appear on the diagonal .",
    "the matrices @xmath30 have a similar simple structure , zeros everywhere except on the diagonal and on the @xmath23-th row .",
    "it is then easy to see that the eigenvalues of @xmath31 at @xmath0 are @xmath32 in particular , the eigenvalues are all real .",
    "one can also see from the structure of that @xmath30 has a full set of eigenvectors , even if some eigenvalues are repeated .",
    "note that because of the particular form of the equations , all coordinate axes , planes and hyperplanes are invariant .",
    "thus , in order that trajectories can travel from @xmath0 to @xmath2 or @xmath3 , it is sufficient to put the restriction @xmath33 , and @xmath34 otherwise , to ensure that they can only go in those directions . in particular , for each @xmath23 , @xmath24 , we require that @xmath35 note also that @xmath36 .",
    "these inequalities guarantee that each equilibrium is a hyperbolic saddle with @xmath5 unstable directions and @xmath37 stable directions .",
    "let @xmath38 be the unstable manifold of @xmath0 restricted to the positive orthant .",
    "we show below that @xmath39 forms a piecewise smooth surface that we will classify topologically as follows .",
    "[ formofgamma ] suppose that inequalities and hold for each @xmath23 , @xmath24 and that each unstable manifold @xmath40 is contained in a compact forward invariant set as specified in lemma  [ positivelyinvariantset ] ( see also remark 3.11 ) .",
    "when @xmath6 is even , the union of unstable manifolds @xmath41 is homeomorphic to a cylinder .",
    "when @xmath6 is odd , @xmath41 is homeomorphic to a mbius strip    the proof of this theorem , which is slightly involved , is left for the appendix .    consider the following definition .",
    "let @xmath42 and @xmath43 be the set of stable and unstable eigenvalues , respectively , of the linearization of a vector field at a saddle equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we say that the saddle is * dissipative * if @xmath46 in other words , the weakest stable eigenvalue is stronger than the strongest unstable eigenvalue .",
    "( see @xcite . )    in terms of the specific vector field under study all the eigenvalues in question are real and for each @xmath23 we have : @xmath47    the main goal of this manuscript is to show that , under the condition that each saddle equilibrium is dissipative , then @xmath41 is asymptotically stable . specifically , our main theorem is :    [ maintheorem ] suppose that inequalities , and hold for each @xmath23 , @xmath24 and that each unstable manifold @xmath40 is contained in a compact forward invariant set as specified in section  [ section : positive_invarian ] .",
    "then @xmath41 is asymptotically stable .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ maintheorem ] breaks roughly into two independent pieces .",
    "we start by considering the trajectory of a representative point that is @xmath48-close to @xmath41 , but is distant from each of the fixed points @xmath49 . in such a case ,",
    "the dynamics of the system are controlled largely by three consecutive saddles @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51",
    ". in section  [ section:3d ] , we consider the restriction of to three consecutive dimensions ; we will gain information on the full - dimensional system by viewing it as a perturbation of this restriction .",
    "the second part of the proof is to consider the dynamics as a trajectory passes near a fixed point ; we consider this in section  [ section : local ] .    in section  [ stablesurface ]",
    "we prove the main theorem . in section  [ parsers ]",
    "we show that there is a non - empty parameter set for which the conditions of the theorem are satisfied .",
    "we begin our proof of theorems 2.1 and 2.3 with a study of the restriction of the system to three dimensional sub - spaces corresponding to three consecutive coordinate directions . through a series of geometric lemmas ,",
    "we prove the main result of the section , theorem  [ 3d ] , which provides information on the behavior of trajectories inside this invariant subspace .",
    "this will be used in later sections to complete the proofs of the main results by providing information on those parts of the full phase space where all but three coordinates are small .",
    "let @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 be any three consecutive equilibria and restrict the system ( [ eq : vectorfield ] ) to the three dimensions spanned by consecutive coordinates @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . for convenience",
    ", we will refer to these three variables as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "our goal in three dimensions is to show the existence of a compact , forward invariant set containing @xmath27 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 such that any trajectory with an initial value in the interior of that set converges to @xmath59 .",
    "restricted to three dimensions , the equations are reduced to @xmath60 the restriction of the dimension of the unstable manifolds via the eigenvalue conditions , and the positivity conditions on @xmath61 yield the following inequalities : @xmath62 of those inequalities , ( [ ev1 ] ) controls the behavior of the system at @xmath27 , ( [ ev2 ] ) - ( [ ev3 ] ) control the behavior of the system at @xmath58 , and ( [ ev4 ] ) - ( [ ev5 ] ) at @xmath59 . the point @xmath63 is a saddle with a two - dimensional unstable manifold , @xmath64 is a saddle with a one - dimensional unstable manifold , and @xmath65 is a sink for the system  ( [ threedimensionalrestriction ] ) .",
    "we remark that although has the form of the may - leonard model , the particular parameter restrictions under consideration yield simple dynamics ( see theorem  [ 3d ] ) , and prevent the more complex behavior usually studied in that context .",
    "in particular , they are inconsistent with the symmetric may - leonard model as it was introduced in @xcite .",
