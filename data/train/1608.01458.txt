    "the flow of viscous incompressible fluid is governed by the navier  stokes equation , @xmath0 and the continuity equation @xmath1 here we adopt conventional notations : @xmath2 is the fluid density , @xmath3 is the flow velocity field , @xmath4 is pressure , @xmath5 is the dynamic viscosity coefficient , @xmath6 is the specific mass force ( if the only external mass force is the gravity , @xmath6 is the gravity ) .",
    "a self - content mathematical description of the problem requires one to specify boundary conditions , and the order of these conditions must be consistent with the order of equations in the bulk . for the case of rigid boundary , these conditions are typically the no - slip conditions ; for the case of nondeformable shear - stress - free boundary , the orthogonal to boundary component of the velocity and the shear stress vanish , _ etc_.    for the case of inviscid fluid , the navier ",
    "stokes equations turns into the euler equation : @xmath7 as the order of with respect to spatial derivatives is decreased compared to , the order of the boundary conditions , required for a self - content mathematical description , is decreased as well .",
    "in particular , the condition of no - slip of the flow along the boundary disappears ; the remaining boundary condition is the condition that the boundary is impermeable .    however , the question of existence of the limiting case transition from the navier  stokes equation to the euler equation arises .",
    "indeed , when kinematic viscosity @xmath8 tends to zero , the reynolds number @xmath9 tends to infinity ( here @xmath10 is the characteristic flow velocity and @xmath11 is the characteristic spatial scale of the system ) . as the reynolds number tends to infinity , a developed turbulence sets - up in the system .",
    "thus , small viscosity for real systems means generally the transition to essentially turbulent flow regimes , while the real turbulence in fluid systems is inherent to the navier  stokes equation , but not the euler equation , which describes the flow of inviscid fluids .",
    "the answer to the question of existence of this limiting case transition requires understanding of the properties of turbulent currents in boundary layers near impermeable walls ( rigid boundary or liquid  liquid interface ) .",
    "the discussion of the turbulent boundary layer , we provide below , gives the opportunity to see , how the solutions to the euler equation may represent real fluid flows at low viscosity , and to estimate the accuracy of the representation of real flows by these solutions .",
    "the latter issue is a nontrivial one ; the characteristic small parameter of the system is determined by its physical parameters in a nonobvious way .",
    "since the consideration and derivations in the following sections heavily rely on the theory of the turbulent boundary layer  @xcite , we revoke here not only its results but also principal points .",
    "this will allow assessing the limits of applicability of the theory results for specific situations .",
    "a detailed consideration can be found in  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the flow of viscous fluid in a half - space near a flat rigid boundary .",
    "it is convenient to choose the boundary as the @xmath12-plane with the @xmath13-axis oriented along the average flow and the @xmath14-axis to be perpendicular to it ( see ) . in a steady state",
    "( statistically stationary state ) , such a flow requires a spatially uniform shear stress @xmath15 , which is related to the momentum flux towards the boundary , and the average flow @xmath16 itself must be a shear one ; @xmath17 .    in the turbulent case ,",
    "the macroscopic average current is controlled by the effective turbulent viscosity .",
    "the turbulent viscosity is related to irregular pulsations of the velocity field which perform the momentum transport ; for the case we consider , they yield the shear stress @xmath15 . the uniform momentum flux performed by pulsations is determined by the intensity of these pulsations ; @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the characteristic value of turbulent pulsations .",
    "notice , equation  ( [ eq-04 ] ) is not an expression for the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath19 , but serves as a definition of the introduced parameter @xmath19 . with this definition",
    ", one can consider the problem in terms of the governing parameter @xmath19 , in place of the original governing parameter @xmath15 .",
    "for the process of transfer of the momentum by turbulent pulsations , the only characteristic spatial scale which can be discriminated in the system is the distance @xmath14 from the boundary .",
    "hence , the turbulent viscosity can be determined only by 3 physical parameters : @xmath14 , @xmath19 and @xmath2",
    ". the only combination of these parameters with the measure units of kinematic viscosity is a product @xmath20 ; and , as there in no dimensionless combinations of these parameters , according to the buckingham @xmath21 theorem  @xcite , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a dimensionless geometric factor , which can be determined empirically or from detailed numerical simulation of turbulent currents .",
    "it is known from experiments that @xmath24 .    with imposed momentum flux ( [ eq-04 ] ) and inhomogeneous viscosity ( [ eq-05 ] ) , one finds @xmath25 from the velocity profile of the macroscopic average flow can be obtained @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the dimensionless integration constant .",
    "expression  ( [ eq-07 ] ) is accurate at the spatial scale large compared to the scale where the molecular viscosity is of the same order of magnitude as the turbulent one , _",
    "i.e. _ , for @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the thickness of so - called viscous sublayer .",
    "the shape of profile @xmath30 for @xmath31 is known from experiments , and it is such that the condition of no slip along the boundary requires @xmath32 .",
    "the case of flow along a nondeformable or weakly - deformable interface between two fluids is qualitatively similar to the case of flow along a rigid boundary , because the basic points used for derivation of hold true .",
    "although constants @xmath23 and @xmath27 may be different compared to the case of a rigid wall , laws ( [ eq-05 ] ) and ( [ eq-07 ] ) must hold valid .",
    "let us estimate the reference order of magnitude of parameters of the turbulent boundary layer for sensible situations with water flows , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the thickness of the viscous sublayer , beyond which the average flow profile is accurately described by  , is @xmath36 , the characteristic value of the argument of logarithm in   in the bulk is @xmath37 ( which yields for the logarithm @xmath38 ) , and the characteristic average flow velocity  ( [ eq-07 ] ) @xmath39 . for the stream canal of a common river , @xmath40 and depth @xmath41 , one can estimate @xmath42 , which yields the logarithm argument @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and the maximal stream speed in the canal @xmath45 .",
    "the solution to euler equation  ( [ eq-03 ] ) with the constrain of the continuity equation  ( [ eq-02 ] ) can be sought in the potential form ; @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the potential of the velocity field .",
    "hence , yields @xmath48 and euler equation  ( [ eq-03 ] ) determines the pressure field in the fluid ; @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the potential of the mass force field , @xmath51 .",
    "the condition of impermeability of a nondeformable boundary in terms of velocity potential provides the boundary conditions for  : @xmath52 .",
    "noteworthy , due to the harmonicity property  ( [ eq-09 ] ) , potential flow  ( [ eq-08 ] ) satisfies also navier  stokes equation  ( [ eq-01 ] ) .",
    "however , in the general case the boundary conditions for a viscous fluid can not be satisfied with a potential flow ; they have a higher order than the order which can be consistent with equation  ( [ eq-09 ] ) .",
    "average over turbulent pulsations fluid flow @xmath53 obeys the following equations with effective turbulent viscosity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath54 where effective turbulent viscosity stress tensor @xmath55 here @xmath4 differs from the molecular pressure and contains a turbulent contribution , superscript @xmath56 indicates transposing . strictly saying , turbulent viscosity is not a scalar , but a tensor of a higher rank .",
    "however , for our treatment it is sufficient to use the approximation of scalar @xmath57 .",
    "the turbulent viscosity property of the primary importance for our consideration is that this viscosity tends to zero as one approaches a nondeformable boundary .",
    "this property is well seen in equation  ( [ eq-05 ] ) .",
    "the persistence of this property for a broad range of situations can be substantiated as follows . by virtue of the fact that for realistic flows of , for instance , water the thickness of the viscous sublayer can be estimated as @xmath58 , there is wide enough range of scales @xmath59 which are large compared to the viscous sublayer thickness , but small compared to the system scale @xmath60 : @xmath61 . at the distance of the order of magnitude of @xmath59 from the boundary of the flow domain",
    ", one can assume a constant in space shear stress , neglect the boundary curvature and inhomogeneity of the average flow along the boundary , and the current to be statistically stationary at this spatial scale .",
    "these assumptions correspond to the basic points adopted for construction of the boundary layer theory in and , therefore , make results  ( [ eq-05 ] ) and ( [ eq-07 ] ) relevant at the scales we consider here .",
    "hence , for @xmath62 the turbulent viscosity tends to zero as one approaches a nondeformable boundary .",
    "the turbulent viscosity coefficient can also vanish at the free interface between two liquids which possesses a nonzero surface tension .",
    "the sufficient condition for this vanishing is the smallness of @xmath63 against the background of the interface curvature radius @xmath64 : @xmath65 . in this case",
    ", one can choose scale @xmath59 such that @xmath66 ; at this scale , the interface is practically inflexible , _",
    "i.e. _ , the result  ( [ eq-05 ] ) is valid , meaning vanishing turbulent viscosity at the interface . the value of @xmath64 for typical problems can be assessed from comparison between the gravity force and the surface tension force ; @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the surface tension coefficient .",
    "hence , @xmath69 . for water",
    ", one finds @xmath70 and , for instance , with @xmath71 there is a wide range of possible values of @xmath59 satisfying condition @xmath66 .",
    "the existence of this range means that the turbulent viscosity vanishes at such an interface .      with the turbulent viscosity vanishing at the boundary",
    ", one can seek the solution to equation  ( [ eq-10 ] ) in a potential form , as the problem is free from the no - slip boundary condition . for @xmath72",
    "the divergence of the turbulent viscosity stress tensor  ( [ eq-11 ] ) reads @xmath73 due to harmonicity of potential flow , @xmath74 employing the results for the turbulent boundary layer provided in , one can compare the order of magnitude of terms @xmath75 and @xmath76 in   for potential flow  ( [ eq-12 ] ) .    indeed , according to , @xmath77 hence , @xmath78 the advective term ( for a potential flow ) @xmath79 the ratio of characteristic values of these two terms is @xmath80 which is a small value at low viscosity , as we will show below in the text .",
    "thus , in equation  ( [ eq-10 ] ) the term which makes it different from the euler equation turns out to be small compared to the other terms .",
    "the ratio @xmath81 is expected to be small at low viscosity ; nonetheless , its characteristic value is yet to be defined .",
    "for an ideal fluid flow , which approximately corresponds to equation  ( [ eq-10 ] ) at low viscosity , the characteristic flow velocity near the boundary is of the same order of magnitude as the one in the bulk .",
    "simultaneously , next to the boundary the logarithmic profile  ( [ eq-07 ] ) occurs , which can be employed for the assessment of the ratio @xmath82    in the limit of arbitrary small viscosity the logarithm argument tends to infinity and , therefore , ratio  ( [ eq-13 ] ) tends to zero .",
    "this fact , indeed , allows one to neglect the term @xmath76 against the background of @xmath75 when considering a potential flow  ( [ eq-12 ] ) .",
    "moreover , with the turbulent mechanism of eddy viscosity a potential flow becomes compatible with the physically natural boundary conditions ( in contradistinction to the case of homogeneous viscosity , where a potential flow is admitted by the navier - stokes equation , but is generally incompatible with boundary conditions ) .",
    "thus , with a given geometry of the flow domain , the euler equation with the boundary conditions for an inviscid fluid turns out to correspond the average over turbulent pulsations flow of a fluid of arbitrary small viscosity . in this sense",
    ", one can speak of the existence of the passage to the limit of inviscid fluid , and the euler equation can be correctly employed for this limiting case .",
    "the small parameter quantifying the accuracy of euler equation for low - viscosity flows is remarkable .",
    "according to , this parameter is @xmath83 parameter @xmath84 is logarithmically small with respect to viscosity @xmath85 and the thickness of the viscous sublayer .",
    "let us make two reference estimates for water flows ( @xmath33 ) : + 1 )  @xmath34 , @xmath86 ( typical for desktop installations ) .",
    "the logarithm argument is @xmath87 and parameter @xmath88 .",
    "+ 2 )  @xmath40 , @xmath89 ( stream canal of a common river ) .",
    "the logarithm argument is @xmath90 and parameter @xmath91 .",
    "+ one can see that the parameter @xmath84 is quite small for these cases .",
    "the smallness of parameter @xmath84 is logarithmically weak with respect to the ratio of the viscous sublayer thickness to the geometric size of the system ; for the above estimates the decrease of @xmath92 by a factor @xmath93 resulted in the decrease of parameter @xmath84 merely by a factor @xmath94 .",
    "let us summarise , what should be the equations and boundary conditions for flows of multiphase systems with free interface at low viscosity .",
    "in , it has been shown , that for an interface with nonzero surface tension the turbulent viscosity should vanish at the interface if @xmath95 . hence , at interfaces in multiphase systems the normal components of the current velocity in contacting phases should be matched , while tangential components can be arbitrary  the mutual slipping of flows is possible .    within each phase",
    "the flow must be potential and smooth .",
    "there is an important point to be emphasised here : the euler equation formally admits discontinuities of the velocity field and , in particular , mutual slipping of flows .",
    "however , the presence of nonzero turbulent viscosity in the bulk of each phase makes the flow discontinuities in the bulk impossible .",
    "the euler equation is valid for mathematical description of the macroscopic average flow as long as this flow is a potential one and its potential in smooth within the given phase .",
    "besides the multiphase systems with nonzero surface tension , there are systems where interfaces do not possess surface tension .",
    "an example of such a system is the case of a contact of two mutually soluble liquids . in this case",
    "the mutual solvation is operated by molecular diffusion and phases can remain well separated at time scales which are large compared to the hydrodynamic time scale .",
    "this conclusion holds valid for the system of two volumes of the same liquid but with different concentration of solute or fine suspension . an external force field",
    "( _ e.g. _ , gravity ) can drive such a multiphase system to a stratified state , where the interface will possess certain effective resilience to deformation ; being distorted , it will tend to restore a flat horizontal shape .",
    "the effective interface resilience can hinder the penetration of vortex motions through the interface and diminish the efficiency of the turbulent eddy transport of the average momentum . as a result",
    ", one should expect decrease of the turbulent viscosity at this interface .",
    "one can estimate the reference length scale @xmath96 of the interface deformations due to turbulent pulsations ; @xmath97 , where @xmath2 is the characteristic density of liquids , @xmath98 is the density difference between two liquids .",
    "wherefrom , @xmath99 at the scales which are large compared to @xmath96 , the basic points of leading to expression  ( [ eq-05 ] ) are relevant , although the value of multiplier @xmath23 specific to this case should be determined empirically but not from a generalised analysis and can differ from @xmath100 . at these scales , it is natural to expect the turbulent viscosity to practically vanish near the interface .",
    "[ tab1 ]    in , the values of @xmath96 are provided for the cases of desktop installations and stream canals of common rivers for a pair of mutually soluble heterogeneous liquids ( @xmath101 ) and confluence of two fresh - water rivers with different natural water hardness ( @xmath102 ) . as an example of the latter , the confluence of the rivers chusovaya and sylva near the ural mountains , for which the detailed measurements on water properties and a persistent stratified state are available  @xcite ,",
    "can be mentioned .",
    "here @xmath103 and during the winter period , when two rivers are covered by ice sheet , a stratified state with a two - layer flow is observed downstream from the confluence site and even upstream from it ; the waters of the river chusovaya overlay the water of the river sylva . in a sample of the average flow velocity profile measured by lepikhin s group  @xcite",
    "is roughly sketched . in this sketch",
    ", one can distinguish a narrow nose near the water ",
    "water interface indicating an eased mutual spilling of water layers , _",
    "i.e. _ , a diminished turbulent viscosity",
    ". the cutting scale of this decrease law for the turbulent viscosity , below which it does not experience further decreasing , is approximately @xmath104 ( cf .  ) .",
    "note , for the interface of the mixing layer , our analysis and conclusions are not applicable .",
    "such an interface possesses neither surface tension nor any kind of effective resilience ; therefore , there is no mechanism for a significant decrease of the turbulent viscosity and thus persistent existence of the potential discontinuity can not be expected .",
    "the passage to the limit of inviscid fluid for the navier  stokes equation exists and it leads to the euler equation . in this limit ,",
    "the fluid flow is turbulent , and the passage is essentially related to the properties of the turbulent boundary layer ; specifically , the property of the effective turbulent viscosity , which is nonuniform in space , to vanish at the rigid boundaries and the liquid  liquid interfaces . with turbulent viscosity vanishing at the boundary",
    ", one can adopt for the macroscopic average flow the same boundary conditions as for an ideal fluid ; the no - slip boundary condition does not appear .",
    "such a boundary conditions can be satisfied with a potential flow , which allows one to seek for the solution in a potential form . simultaneously",
    ", the relative contribution of the term related to turbulent viscosity into the equation for the macroscopic average flow turns out to be logarithmically small with respect to the ratio of the viscous sublayer thickness @xmath63 to the geometric size of the system @xmath11 ; this contribution is quantified by a small dimensionless parameter @xmath105 $ ] , where for a rigid boundary @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( for a free interface , geometric coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath27 may be different ) .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath108 , the potential of the macroscopic average flow obeys the same equation to which the potential solutions to the euler equation obey .    in this sense",
    ", one can speak of existence of the passage to the euler equation in the limit of arbitrary small viscosity ; the solution to the euler equation represents macroscopic fluid flow averaged over turbulent pulsations .",
