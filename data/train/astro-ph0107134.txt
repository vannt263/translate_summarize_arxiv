    "the argument that active galaxies and quasars are powered by accretion onto massive compact objects was first made almost four decades ago ( salpeter 1964 ; zeldovich 1964 ) . since that time , the existence of supermassive black holes has been confirmed in the nuclei of nearby galaxies and in a handful of more distant galaxies by direct dynamical measurement of their masses .",
    "the best determinations are in our own galaxy ( @xmath4 , genzel 2000 ; ghez 1998 ) , ngc 4258 ( miyoshi 1995 ) , and m87 ( macchetto 1997 ) .",
    "the data for each of these galaxies exhibit a clear rise very near the center in the orbital velocity of stars or gas , suggestive of motion around a compact object .",
    "data of this quality are unfortunately still rare , and the majority of black hole detections have necessarily been based on stellar - kinematical data which do not exhibit a clear signature of the presence of a black hole . these data ( magorrian 1998 ; richstone 1998 ) imply a mean black hole mass that is uncomfortably large compared with values predicted from quasar light .",
    "the inconsistency has been taken as evidence for low radiative efficiencies during the optically bright phase of quasars ( e.g. haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ) or for continued growth of black holes after the quasar epoch ( e.g. richstone 1998 ) .",
    "it is now clear that this discrepancy was due almost entirely to systematic errors in the stellar kinematical mass estimates .",
    "the first convincing demonstration of this came from the @xmath1 relation , a tight empirical correlation between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "the @xmath1 relation was discovered by ranking black hole detections in terms of their believability and excluding the least secure cases . the remarkable and unexpected result ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) was an almost perfect correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the best - determined black hole masses , compared to a much weaker correlation for the less secure masses .",
    "ground - based , stellar kinematical estimates of @xmath5 were found to scatter above the @xmath1 relation by as much as two orders of magnitude , suggesting that many of the published masses were spurious and that most were substantial overestimates .",
    "the ability of the @xmath1 relation to `` separate the wheat from the chaff '' has led to a rapid advance in our understanding of black hole demographics .",
    "we review that progress in  2 and  3 ; we argue that there is now almost embarrassingly good agreement between the results from the various techniques for estimating the mean mass density of black holes in the universe .",
    "black hole masses determined dynamically in nearby quiescent galaxies are now fully consistent with masses inferred in active galaxies and quasars , and with estimates of the density of dark relic objects produced by accretion during the quasar epoch .",
    "the need for non - standard accretion histories in order to reproduce a large density of black holes in the current universe has disappeared .",
    "two recurrent themes in this review are the importance of adequate data when estimating black hole masses ; and the much greater usefulness of _ accurate _ mass estimates compared with simple detections .",
    "when the first black hole detections were being published , there was much discussion about whether the observations ( all ground - based at the time ) were of sufficient quality to resolve the black holes sphere of influence , @xmath7 .",
    "we now know that the ground - based data almost always failed to do this , sometimes by a large factor , and that this failure , coupled with shortcomings in the modelling , led to systematic overestimates of @xmath5 (  2 ) .",
    "the situation has improved somewhat with the space telescope , but not dramatically : we argue (  4 ) that the number of galaxies with secure dynamical estimates of @xmath5 will increase only modestly over the next few years in spite of ambitious ongoing programs with hst .",
    "this is due partly to the fact that these observations were planned at a time when the mean black hole mass was believed to be much larger than it is now .",
    "progress in our understanding of black hole demographics is more likely to come from techniques with higher effective resolution than stellar or gas kinematics , notably reverberation mapping in agn ( peterson 1993 ) .",
    "while the ability of the @xmath1 relation to clarify the data has been an enormous boon , the existence of such a tight correlation must also be telling us something fundamental about the way in which black holes form and about the connection between black holes and bulges .",
    "unfortunately , the theoretical understanding of this connection has lagged behind the phenomenology .",
    "we summarize the proposed explanations for the origin of the @xmath1 relation in  5 and discuss their strengths and weaknesses .",

    "the former sample included many `` standard bearers '' like m31 ( richstone , bower & dressler 1990 ) , ngc 3115 ( kormendy 1996a ) and ngc 4594 ( kormendy 1996b ) .",
    "the size of the discrepancy was difficult to pin down since there were ( and still are ) essentially no galaxies for which black hole masses had been independently derived using more than one technique .",
    "however the masses derived from ground - based stellar kinematics were much larger , by roughly an order of magnitude on average , than those inferred from other techniques when galaxies with similar properties were compared , or when estimates of the cosmological density of black holes or the mean ratio of black hole mass to bulge mass were made .",
    "the discrepancy was clearest in two arenas :    * _ active vs. quiescent galaxies .",
    "_ in seyfert galaxies , the gravitational influence of the black hole can be measured on small scales , @xmath8 pc , using emission lines from the broad emission line region ( blr ) .",
    "the technique of `` reverberation mapping '' combines the velocity of the blr gas with an estimate of the size of the blr based on time delay measurements ( peterson 1993 ) .",
    "reverberation mapping masses have been derived for about three dozen black holes ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ; kaspi 2000 ) .",
    "these masses fall a factor of 5 - 20 below the @xmath9 relation defined by ground - based , stellar kinematical data ( wandel 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "* _ quasar light vs. black hole demographics . _",
    "the mass density of black holes at large redshifts can be estimated by requiring the optical qso luminosity function to be reproduced by accretion onto black holes ( soltan 1982 ) . assuming a standard accretion efficiency of @xmath10 , the mean mass density in black holes works out to be @xmath11 ( chokshi & turner 1992 ; salucci 1999 ) . a similar argument based on the x - ray background",
    "gives consistent results , @xmath12 ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ; salucci 1999 ) . by comparison ,",
    "the black hole mass density implied by stellar kinematical modelling was about ten times higher ( magorrian 1998 ; richstone 1998 ; faber 1999 ) .",
    "serious inconsistencies like these only appeared when comparisons were made with black hole masses derived from the stellar kinematical data ; all other techniques gave roughly consistent values for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "nevertheless , most authors accepted the correctness of the stellar dynamical mass estimates and looked elsewhere to explain the discrepancies . ho ( 1999 ) suggested that the reverberation mapping masses had been systematically underestimated .",
    "wandel ( 1999 ) proposed that black holes in active galaxies were smaller on average than those in quiescent galaxies , due either to different accretion histories or to selection effects .",
    "richstone ( 1998 ) and faber ( 1999 ) suggested that the inconsistency between their group s masses and the masses inferred from quasar light could be explained if black holes had acquired @xmath15 of their mass _ after _ the quasar epoch through some process that produced no observable radiation .",
    "what particularly caught our attention was the gulf between black hole masses derived from high- and low - resolution data , and ( to a lesser extent ) between gas- and stellar dynamical data ; the former ( e.g. ferrarese , ford & jaffe 1996 ; ferrarese & ford 1999 ) were typically taken at higher resolution than the latter .",
    "black hole masses derived from the highest resolution data , in galaxies like the milky way ( ghez 1998 ; genzel 2000 ) and m87 ( macchetto 1997 ) , were the _",
    "smallest _ when expressed as a fraction of the bulge mass , with @xmath16 .",
    "largest _ fractional black hole masses  in galaxies like ngc 3377 ( kormendy 1998 ) or ngc 4486b ( kormendy 1997 )  were mostly derived from stellar absorption - line spectra obtained from the ground , at resolutions of @xmath17 , corresponding to typical linear scales of @xmath18 pc .",
    "the mean value of @xmath19 for these galaxies was claimed to be about @xmath20 ( magorrian 1998 ; richstone 1998 ) , roughly an order of magnitude greater than the value derived from the high - resolution data .",
    "we began to suspect that some of the masses derived from the lower - quality data might be serious over - estimates  or , even worse , that some of the `` detections '' based on these data were spurious .    to test this hypothesis",
    ", we tabulated all of the published black hole masses that had been derived from stellar- or gas kinematical data ( excluding the reverberation mapping masses ) and divided them into two groups based on their expected accuracy .",
    "this is not quite as easy as it sounds , since the `` accuracy '' of a black hole mass estimate is not necessarily related in any simple way to its published confidence range .",
    "our criterion was simply the quality of the data : `` accurate '' black hole masses were those derived from hst data , at resolutions of @xmath21 , as well as @xmath5 for the milky way black hole ( which is by far the nearest ) and the black hole in ngc 4258 ( for which vlbi gives a resolution of @xmath22 pc ) .",
    "the velocity data for these galaxies ( our `` sample a '' ) was always found to exhibit a clear rise in the inner few data points , suggesting that the black hole s sphere of influence @xmath23 had been well resolved .",
    "the remaining black hole masses ( `` sample b '' ) were all those derived from lower - resolution data , typically ground - based stellar kinematics , including most of the masses in the magorrian ( 1998 ) study . sample a contained 12 galaxies , sample b 31 .    our first attempt to compare `` sample a '' and `` sample b '' masses was disappointing ( figure 1a ) . in the @xmath9 plane ,",
    "the sample a masses do fall slightly below those from sample b , but the intrinsic scatter in @xmath24 is apparently so large that there is no clear difference in the relations defined by the two samples .",
    "but when we plotted @xmath5 versus the velocity dispersion @xmath6 of the bulge stars , something magical happened ( figure 1b ) : now the sample a galaxies clearly defined the _ lower edge _ of the relation , while the sample b galaxies scattered above , some by as much as two orders of magnitude in @xmath5 !",
    "furthermore the correlation defined by the sample a galaxies alone was very tight .",
    "what particularly impressed us about the @xmath25 plot was the fact that the sample a galaxies , which are diverse in their properties , showed such a tight correlation ; while the sample b galaxies , which are much more homogeneous , exhibited a large scatter .",
    "for instance , sample a contains two spiral galaxies , two lenticulars , and both dwarf and giant ellipticals ; while the sample b galaxies are almost exclusively giant ellipticals .",
    "furthermore the black hole masses in sample a were derived using a variety of techniques , including absorption - line stellar kinematics ( m32 , ngc 4342 ) , dynamics of gas disks ( m87 , ngc 4261 ) , and velocities of discrete objects ( mw , ngc 4258 ) ; while in sample b all of the black hole masses were derived from stellar spectra obtained from the ground .",
    "this was circumstantial , but to us compelling , evidence that the sample a masses were defining the true relation and that the sample b masses were systematically in error .    fitting a regression line to @xmath26 vs. @xmath27 for the sample a galaxies alone , we found @xmath28 with @xmath29 ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "we defined the quantity @xmath30 to be the rms velocity of stars in an aperture of radius @xmath31 centered on the nucleus , with @xmath32 the half - light radius of the bulge .",
    "this radius is large enough that the stellar velocities are expected to be affected at only the few percent level by the gravitational force from the black hole , but small enough that @xmath30 can easily be measured from the ground .",
    "a striking feature of the @xmath1 relation is its negligible scatter .",
    "the reduced @xmath33 of sample a about the best - fit line of eq . 1 , taking into account measurement errors in both variables , is only @xmath34 , essentially a perfect fit .",
    "such a tight correlation seemed almost too good to be true ( and may in fact be a fluke resulting from the small sample size ) but we felt we could not rule it out given the existence of other , similarly tight correlations in astronomy , e.g. the near - zero thickness of the elliptical galaxy fundamental plane .",
    "in fact the scatter in the @xmath1 relation is so small that it is reasonable to use the relation to _ predict _ black hole masses , even in galaxies for which determinations of @xmath5 based on detailed modelling have previously been published .",
    "one can then ask , galaxy by galaxy , whether the observations on which the published estimate of @xmath5 was based were of sufficiently high quality to resolve the black hole s sphere of influence .",
    "table 1 and figure 2 show the results .",
    "table 1 is a ranked list of the most secure black hole detections to date .",
    "the galaxies are listed in order of increasing @xmath35 , i.e. the ratio of the size of the resolution element to twice the radius of influence of the black hole . in the case of hst observations , for which the psf is undersampled , fwhm is the diameter of the fos aperture or the width of the stis slit . for ground - based observations",
    ", fwhm refers to the seeing disk .",
    "figure 2 plots the same quantities for essentially all galaxies with published estimates of @xmath5 based on stellar or gas kinematics .    not surprisingly , only the black holes in the milky way and in ngc 4258 have been observed at a resolution greatly exceeding @xmath36 . the sample a galaxies of ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) also satisfy @xmath37 ,",
    "although sometimes marginally . by contrast , almost none of the ground - based data resolved @xmath36 , sometimes failing by more than a factor of 10 .",

    "the answer to the first question is simple in retrospect .",
    "figure 5 shows how the signal of the black hole  a sudden rise in the rms stellar velocities at a distance of @xmath77 from the black hole ",
    "is degraded by seeing . for @xmath78 ,",

    "most of the ground - based observations fall into this regime ( figure 2 ) .",
    "in fact the situation is even worse than figure 5 suggests , since for @xmath80 , the rise in @xmath81 will be measured by only a single data point .",
    "this is the case for many of the galaxies that are listed as `` resolved '' in table 1 ( e.g. ngc 3379 , gebhardt 2000a ) .",
    "a short digression is in order at this point .",
    "data taken from the ground often show an impressive central spike in the velocity dispersion profile ; examples are ngc 4594 ( kormendy 1996b ) and ngc 4486b ( kormendy 1997 ) .",
    "however such features are due in part to blending of light from two sides of the nucleus where the rotational velocity has opposite signs and would be almost as impressive even if the black hole were not present .",
    "this point was first emphasized by tonry ( 1984 ) in the context of his ground - based m32 observations . as he showed , the velocity dispersion spike in m32 as observed at @xmath82 resolution is consistent with rotational broadening and does not require any increase in the _ intrinsic _ velocity dispersion near the center",
    ".    why should poor data lead preferentially to overestimates of @xmath5 , rather than random errors ? there are two reasons . first , as pointed out by van der marel ( 1997 ) , much of the model - fitting prior to 1999 was carried out using isotropic spherical models or their axisymmetric analogs , the so - called `` two - integral '' ( 2i ) models .",
    "such models predict a velocity dispersion profile that gently _ falls _ as one moves inward , for two reasons : non - isothermal cores , i.e. @xmath83 with @xmath84 , generically have central minima in the rms velocity ( e.g. dehnen 1993 ) ; and , when flattened , the 2i axisymmetric models become dominated by nearly circular orbits ( in order to maintain isotropy in the meridional plane ) further reducing the predicted velocities near the center .",
    "figure 6 illustrates these effects for a set of axisymmetric 2i models with @xmath85 .",
    "real galaxies almost always exhibit a monotonic rise in @xmath86 . adding a central point",
    "mass can correct this deficiency of the models , but only an unphysically large value of @xmath63 will affect the stellar motions at large enough radii , @xmath87 , to do the trick .",
    "this is probably the explanation for the factor @xmath66 mean error in @xmath5 derived from the best ground - based data ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the much larger values of @xmath88 associated with the more distant galaxies in figure 3 are probably attributable to a different factor . when the data contain no useful information about the black hole mass , only values of @xmath63 that are much larger than the true mass will significantly affect the @xmath33 of the model fits .",
    "the only black holes that can be `` seen '' in such data are excessively massive ones .",
    "can these problems be overcome by abandoning 2i models in favor of more general , three - integral ( 3i ) models ?",
    "the answer , surprisingly , is `` no '' : making the modelling algorithm more flexible ( without also increasing the amount or quality of the data ) has the effect of _ weakening _ the constraints on @xmath5 .",
    "the reason is illustrated in figure 7 .",
    "the rms velocities in 2i models are uniquely determined by the assumed potential , i.e. by @xmath63 and @xmath89 , the mass - to - light ratio assumed for the stars .",
    "this means that the models are highly _ over - constrained _ by the data  there are far more observational constraints ( velocities ) than adjustable parameters ( @xmath90 ) , hence one expects to find a unique set of values for @xmath63 and @xmath89 that come closest to reproducing the data .",
    "this is the usual case in problems of statistical estimation and it implies a well - behaved set of @xmath33 contours with a unique minimum .    when the same data are modeled using the more general distribution of orbits available in a 3i model , the problem becomes _ under_-constrained : now one has the freedom to adjust the phase - space distribution function in order to compensate for changes in @xmath63 and @xmath89 , so as to leave the goodness of fit precisely unchanged .",
    "the result is a plateau in @xmath33 ( figure 7 ) , the width of which depends in a complicated way on the ratio of observational constraints to number of orbits or phase - space cells in the modelling algorithm ( merritt 1994 ) .",
    "thus , 3i modelling of the ground - based data would only show that the range of possible values of @xmath63 includes , but is not limited to , the values found using the 2i models ; it would not generate more precise estimates of @xmath5 unless the data quality were also increased .    the greater difficulty of interpreting results from 3i modelling has not been widely appreciated ; few authors make a distinction between `` indeterminacy '' in @xmath5 ( the width of the constant-@xmath33 plateau in figure 7 ) and `` uncertainty '' ( the additional range in @xmath5 allowed by measurement errors ) , or look carefully at how their confidence range depends on the number of orbits used .",
    "we illustrate these difficulties by examining two recently published studies based on high quality , stellar kinematical data .",
    "_ ngc 3379 _ ( gebhardt 2000a ) : the prima - facie evidence for a central mass concentration in this galaxy consists of a single data point , the innermost velocity dispersion as measured by hst / fos ; the rotation curve exhibits no central rise , in fact it drops monotonically toward the center .",
    "goodness - of - fit contours generated from 3i models show the expected plateau ( fig .",
    "7 of gebhardt ) , extending from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",

    "cretton & van den bosch find that a black - hole - free model provides `` fits to the actual data [ that ] look almost indistinguishable from that of model b '' ( a model with @xmath95 ) .",
    "their @xmath33 contours ( their fig .",
    "7 ) nevertheless seem to show a preferred black hole mass ; however they note that @xmath33 is dominated by the data at radii @xmath96 , far outside of the radius of influence of the black hole .",
    "the probable culprit here is the modest number of orbits ( @xmath97 , compared with @xmath98 constraints ) in their 3i solutions .",
    "outer data points are always the most difficult to fit when modelling via a finite orbit library since only a fraction of the orbits extend to large radii ; this is clear in their fits ( cf . their fig .",
    "8) which become progessively worse at large radii .",
    "we emphasize that both of these modelling studies were based on high - quality data , with @xmath99 ( ngc 3379 ) and @xmath100 ( ngc 4342 ) ( table 1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the extreme freedom associated with 3i models permits a wide range of black hole masses to be fit to the velocity data in both galaxies . as figure 2 shows ,",
    "most of the galaxies in the ongoing hst / stis survey of galactic nuclei will be observed at even lower effective resolutions ; hence we predict that the black hole masses in many of these galaxies will turn out to be consistent with zero and that the range of allowed masses will usually be large .",
    "( to be fair , we note that these observations were planned at a time when @xmath0 was believed to be much larger than it is now . )",
    "we therefore urge caution when interpreting results like kormendy & gebhardt s ( 2001 ) recent compilation of black hole masses derived from unpublished 3i modelling .",
    "the techniques that allow us to detect supermassive black holes in quiescent galaxies are rarely applicable to the hosts of bright agns . in the seyfert",
    "1 galaxies and in the handful of qsos that are close enough that the black hole s sphere of influence has some chance of being resolved , the presence of the bright non - thermal nucleus ( e.g. malkan , gorjian & tam 1998 ) severely dilutes the very features which are necessary for dynamical studies .",
    "the only bright agn in which a supermassive black hole has been detected by spatially - resolved kinematics is the nearby ( herrnstein et al .",
    "1999 ; newman 2000 ) seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 4258 , which is blessed with the presence of an orderly water maser disk ( watson & wallin 1994 ; greenhill 1995 ; miyoshi 1995 ) . the radius of influence of the black hole at its center , @xmath101015 , can barely be resolved by hst but can be fully sampled by the vlba at 22.2 ghz .",
    "unfortunately , water masers are rare and of the handful that are known , only in ngc 4258 are the maser clouds distributed in a simple geometrical configuration that exhibits clear keplerian motion around the central source ( braatz 1996 ; greenhill 1996 , 1997 ; greenhill , moran & herrnstein 1997 ; trotter 1998 ) .",
    "black hole demographics in agns must therefore proceed via alternate routes .",
    "dynamical modeling of the broad emission line region ( blr ) constitutes a viable alternative to spatially - resolved kinematical studies . according to the standard model ,",
    "the blr consists of many ( @xmath102 , arav 1997 , 1998 ; dietrich 1999 ) , small , dense ( @xmath103 @xmath104 ) , cold ( @xmath105 k ) photoionized clouds ( ferland 1992 ) , localized within a volume of a few light days to several tens of light weeks in diameter around the central ionization source ( but see also smith & raine 1985 , 1988 ; pelletier & pudritz 1992 ; murray 1995 ; murray & chiang 1997 ; collin - souffrin 1988 ) . as such ,",
    "the blr is , and will likely remain , spatially unresolved . in the presence of a variable non - thermal nuclear continuum , however , the responsivity - weighted radius @xmath106 of the blr is measured by the light - travel time delay between emission and continuum variations ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 1993 ; netzer & peterson 1997 ; koratkar & gaskell 1991 ) . _",
    "if _ the blr is gravitationally bound , the central mass is given by the virial theorem as @xmath107 , where the fwhm of the emission lines ( generally h@xmath108 ) is taken as being representative of the rms velocity @xmath109 , once assumptions are made about the blr geometry .",
    "in a few cases , independent measurements of @xmath106 and @xmath109 have been derived from different emission lines : it is found that the two quantities define a `` virial relation '' in the sense @xmath110 ( koratkar & gaskell 1991 ; wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ; peterson & wandel 2000 ) , suggesting a simple picture of a stratified blr in keplerian motion .    on the downside",
    ", mapping the blr response to continuum variations requires many ( @xmath111 ) repeated observations taken at closely spaced time intervals , @xmath112 .",
    "moreover , the observations can be translated into black hole masses only if a series of reasonable , but untested , assumptions are made regarding the geometry , stability and velocity structure of the blr , the radial emissivity function of the gas , and the geometry and location ( relative to the blr ) of the ionizing continuum source . if a wrong assumption is made , systematic errors of a factor @xmath66 can result ( krolik 2001 ) .",
    "the uncertainties surrounding reverberation mapping has made the derived black hole masses an easy target for critics ( e.g. richstone 1998 ; ho 1999 ) .",
    "on the other hand , because the blr gas samples a spatial region very near to the black hole , there is almost no possibility of making the much larger errors in @xmath5 that have plagued the ground - based stellar kinematical studies ( magorrian 1998 ) .",

    "while the exact functional form of the dependence is debated ( koratkar & gaskell 1991 ; kaspi 1996 , 2000 ; wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ) , the @xmath113 relation can potentially provide an inexpensive way of bypassing reverberation mapping measurements on the way to determining black hole masses .      with one exception ( ferrarese 2001 )",

    "@xmath130 , i.e. the blr is spherical and characterized by an isotropic velocity distribution .",
    "this differs from the assumption made by mclure & dunlop that the blr is a thin , rotation - dominated disk , i.e. @xmath131 , which predicts velocities @xmath132 times larger and black holes masses three times greater . *",

    "we draw the following conclusions .    1",
    ".   the seyfert , qso and quiescent galaxy samples are largely consistent .",
    "a simple least - squares fit gives @xmath138 ( qsos ) and @xmath139 ( seyferts ) , compared with @xmath140 for quiescent galaxies ( merritt & ferrarese 2001a ) .",
    "we further note that the disk / bulge decompositions for two of the objects with low @xmath19 , @xmath141 , are deemed of lower quality ( mclure & dunlop 2000 ) .",
    "thus it does not appear to be the case , as suggested by richstone ( 1998 ) and ho ( 1999 ) , that supermassive black holes in agn are undermassive relative to their counterparts in quiescent galaxies .",
    "in fact , assuming a flattened blr geometry would further increase the agn masses .",
    "2 .   @xmath0 in agns is lower , by a factor @xmath142 , than predicted by the magorrian ( 1998 ) relation .",
    "this is further evidence that the mass estimates derived from ground - based kinematics were systematically in error .",
    "3 .   in view of recent claims , it is interesting to ask whether narrow line seyfert 1s and qsos ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) contain smaller black holes compared with the rest of the agn sample ( vron - cetty , vron & goncalves 2001 and references therein ; mathur 2001 ) .",
    "the size of the symbols in figure 8 is proportional to the fwhm of the h@xmath108 line : the boundary between regular and narrow line objects corresponds to the size used in the figure legend .",
    "no correlation between line width and @xmath19 is readily apparent for the seyferts , while a hint might be present for the qsos . on the other hand , bulge / disk decompositions are less accurate for most of the narrow line qsos , and it is possible that bulge luminosities in these objects have been overestimated .",
    "the large uncertanities in the data , and the large intrinsic scatter in the @xmath115 relation , make it very difficult to test whether the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath143 is linear . however , an ordinary least square fit to the data produces slopes consistent , at the 1@xmath6 level , with a linear relation for both the qso and seyfert 1 samples ( cf laor 2001 ) .",
    "because of its large intrinsic scatter , there is little more that can be learned about black hole demographics from the @xmath115 relation .",
    "an alternative route is suggested by the @xmath1 relation for quiescent galaxies , which exhibits much less scatter .",
    "very few accurate measurements of @xmath6 are available in agns , due to the difficulty of separating the bright nucleus from the faint underlying stellar population .",
    "the first program to map agns onto the @xmath1 relation was undertaken by ferrarese ( 2001 ) .",
    "velocity dispersions in the bulges of six galaxies with reverberation mapping masses were obtained , thus producing the first sample of agns for which both the black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion are accurately known ( with formal uncertainties of 30% and 15% respectively ) .",
    "figure 9 shows the relation between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion for the six reverberation - mapped agns observed by ferrarese ( 2001 ) , plus an additional object with a high - quality @xmath6 from the literature ( nelson & whittle 1995 ) .",
    "the quiescent galaxies ( sample a from ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) are shown by the black dots .",
    "the consistency between black hole masses in active and quiescent galaxies is even more striking here than in the @xmath114 plot .",
    "the only noticeable difference between the two samples is a slightly greater scatter in the reverberation mapping masses ( in spite of similar , formal error bars ) .",
    "narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies do not stand out in any way from the rest of the agn sample .",
    "we conclude that there is no longer any prima facie reason to believe that reverberation - based masses are less reliable than those based on the kinematics of stars or gas disks .",
    "this is important since the resolution of stellar kinematical studies will remain fixed at @xmath144 for the forseeable future , whereas reverberation mapping samples a region which is per se unresolvable and is the only technique that can yield accurate masses for very small ( @xmath145 ) or very distant black holes .",
    "the smallest nuclear black holes whose masses have been securely established are in the milky way and m32 , both of which have @xmath146 ( table 1 ) .",
    "how small can supermassive black holes be ? some formation scenarios ( e.g. haenhelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ) naturally predict a lower limit of @xmath91 .",

    "observationally , a black hole with @xmath147 could only be resolved in a very nearby galaxy .",
    "an obvious candidate is the local group late type spiral m33 : the absence of an obvious bulge , and the low central stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath148 , kormendy & mclure 1993 ) both argue for a very small black hole . according to the @xmath1 relation ( eq .",
    "2 ) , @xmath149 m@xmath150 , but a range of at least @xmath151 is allowed given the uncertainties in the slope of the relation .",
    "we show in figure 10 the rotation curve and velocity dispersion profile of the m33 nucleus obtained from hst / stis data .",

    "the rotation curve is consistent with solid - body rotation .",
    "a dynamical analysis ( merritt , ferrarese & joseph 2001 ) gives an upper limit to the central mass of @xmath155 . while this is tantalizingly similar to the masses inferred for ulxs ( matsumoto et al .",

    "the two subsamples containing only stellar kinematical or stellar dynamical data produce fits with slopes of @xmath161 , in agreement with each other and with the slope quoted for the complete sample .",
    "however , something interesting happens when the eight galaxies in table 1 for which @xmath36 has _ not _ been resolved are added to the sample ( all of the mass determinations in these galaxies are based on stellar dynamics ) .",
    "figure 11 shows the slope of the @xmath1 relation obtained from the stellar dynamical mass estimates when various cutoffs are placed on the quality of the data .",
    "if the complete sample is used ( including all entries in table 1 down to ngc 2778 ) , the slope becomes quite shallow , @xmath162 .",
    "when only the best - resolved galaxies are included , @xmath163 , the slope increases to @xmath164 , identical to the value obtained from the gas dynamical masses alone .",
    "mass estimates based on the dynamics of gas disks are expected to be more accurate than estimates from stellar dynamics at equal resolution since the inclination angle of the disk can be measured and ( if the motions are in equilibrium ) the circular orbital geometry is simpler ( faber 1999 ) . from figure 11 , we conclude that the inclusion of masses derived from data that do not properly sample the black hole s sphere of influence biases the slope of the relation .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by merritt & ferrarese ( 2001b ) .",
    "we also show in figure 11 the results of least - squares fits using a simpler algorithm that does not account for measurement errors .",
    "this is the same algorithm used by gebhardt ( 2000a ) . as pointed out by merritt & ferrarese ( 2001b ) ,",
    "not accounting for measurement errors biases the slope too low : the inferred slope for the complete sample of stellar dynamical masses falls to @xmath165 using the simpler algorithm , similar to the slope quoted by gebhardt ( 2000a ) and kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 ) .",
    "thus the lower slope quoted by those authors is due to the inclusion of less accurate data points and to the use of a less precise regression algorithm .",
    "we noted above that a total of @xmath166 galaxies have been or will be observed with hst during the next two years with the hope of constraining the mass of the central black hole .",
    "how many of these new data sets will in fact lead to stringent constraints on @xmath5 ?",

    "black hole masses have been estimated from the @xmath1 relation , eq .",
    "we argued above that the condition @xmath167 , compounded by the low s / n characteristic of hst data , will likely lead to weak constraints or biased determinations of @xmath5 , particularly in the case of stellar absorption line data .",

    "less than one quarter will be resolved as well or better than ngc 3379 ( @xmath99 ) , for which the constraints on @xmath5 are weak (  2.2 ) . among the galaxies slated to be observed in ionized gas",
    ", the preliminary results of sarzi ( 2001 ) suggest that few will be found to have the well - ordered disks that are necessary for secure estimates of @xmath5 .",
    "many of the `` sample a '' galaxies from ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) were originally targeted for observation because of their exceptionally favorable properties , such as nearness ( the milky way , m32 ) , existence of a well - ordered maser disk ( ngc 4258 ) , etc .",
    "it is unlikely that many more galaxies will turn out to have equally favorable properties .",
    "the majority of the targeted galaxies are expected to have black holes with masses of order @xmath168 .",
    "this range is already well sampled by the current data ; however the new detections might provide useful information about the scatter of the @xmath1 relation",
    ". only a handful of black holes with masses @xmath169 or @xmath170 will be detected , and probably none in the @xmath171 range .",
    "probing the low and high mass end of the @xmath1 relation is of particular interest since the slope and scatter of the relation have important implications for hierarchical models of galaxy formation ( haehnelt , natarajan , & rees 1998 ; silk & rees 1998 ; haehnelt & kauffmann 2000 ) and the effect of mergers on subsequent evolution ( cattaneo  1999 ) .",
    "the fact that the new observations will not appreciably extend the range of masses is not due to poor planning : the simple fact is that very small or very massive black holes are found in galaxies which are not close enough to resolve their sphere of influence using current optical / near infrared instrumentation .",
    "it is our opinion that the future of the @xmath1 relation relies on methods other than traditional dynamical studies .",
    "an aggressive campaign to reverberation map a large sample of agns appears to be the obvious solution .",
    "the recent results from ferrarese ( 2001 ) show that reverberation mapping can produce mass estimates with a precision comparable to traditional dynamical studies .",
    "although the obvious drawback is that it is only applicable to the @xmath172 of galaxies with type 1 agn , reverberation mapping is intrinsically unbiased with respect to black hole mass , provided the galaxies can be monitored with the appropriate time resolution : while dynamical methods rely on the ability to spatially resolve the black hole s sphere of influence , reverberation mapping samples a region which is per se unresolvable .",
    "furthermore , reverberation mapping can probe galaxies at high redshifts and with a wide range of nuclear activity , opening an avenue to explore possible dependences of the @xmath1 relation on redshift and activity level .",
    "the greatest dividend to come so far from the @xmath1 relation has been the resolution of the apparent discrepancy between black hole masses in nearby galaxies , the masses of black holes in agn , and the mass density in black holes needed to explain quasar light .",
    "but the importance of the @xmath1 relation presumably goes beyond its ability to clarify the data . like other tight , empirical correlations in astronomy , the @xmath1 relation must be telling us something fundamental about origins , and in particular , about the connection between black hole mass and bulge properties .",
    "probably the simplest way to relate black holes to bulges is to assume a fixed ratio of @xmath5 to @xmath143 . since @xmath173 ( eq .",
    "2 ) , this assumption implies @xmath174 .",
    "in fact this is well known to be the case : bulge luminosities scale as @xmath175 , the faber - jackson law , and mass - to - light ratios scale as @xmath176 ( faber 1987 ) , giving @xmath177 , in agreement with the slope @xmath178 derived above for the @xmath1 relation .    on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath1 relation appears to be much tighter than the relation between @xmath6 and bulge mass or luminosity . and",
    "even if a tight correlation between black hole mass and bulge mass were set up in the early universe , it is hard to see how it could survive mergers , which readily convert disks to bulges and may also channel gas into the nucleus , producing ( presumably ) uncorrelated changes in @xmath5 and @xmath143 .",
    "the tightness of the @xmath1 relation suggests that some additional feedback mechanism acts to more directly connect black hole masses to stellar velocity dispersions and to maintain that connection in spite of mergers .",
    "one such feedback mechanism was suggested by silk & rees ( 1998 ) even before the discovery of the @xmath1 relation .",
    "these authors explored a model in which supermassive black holes first form via collapse of @xmath91 gas clouds before most of the bulge mass has turned into stars .",
    "the black holes created in this way would then accrete and radiate , driving a wind which acts back on the accretion flow . ignoring star formation , departures from spherical symmetry etc .",
    ", the flow would stall if the rate of deposition of mechanical energy into the infalling gas was large enough to unbind the protogalaxy in a crossing time @xmath179 .",
    "taking for the energy deposition rate some fraction @xmath180 of the eddington luminosity @xmath181 , we have @xmath182 writing @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 with @xmath186 the opacity , @xmath187 consistent with the observed relation",
    ". the constant of proportionality works out to be roughly correct if @xmath188 ( silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "this model assumes that black holes acquire most of their mass during a fast accretion phase , @xmath189 yr .",
    "kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2000 ) developed a semi - analytic model for galaxy formation in which black holes grow progressively larger during galaxy mergers .",
    "the cooling of the gas that falls in during mergers is assumed to be partially balanced by energy input from supernovae .",
    "this feedback is stronger for smaller galaxies which has the effect of steepening the resulting relation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "haehnelt & kauffmann ( 2000 ) found @xmath190 but the slope could easily have been increased if the feedback had been set higher ( m. haehnelt , private communication ) .",
    "however the scatter in the @xmath1 relation derived by them was only slightly less than the scatter in @xmath5 vs @xmath24 , in apparent contradiction with the observations ( figure 1 ) .",
    "burkert & silk ( 2001 ) also considered a model in which black holes grow by accreting gas during mergers . in their model",
    ", accretion is halted when star formation begins to exhaust the gas in the outer accreting disk ; the viscous accretion rate is proportional to @xmath191 , and assuming a star formation time scale that is proportional to @xmath179 , burkert & silk found @xmath192 , with a constant of proportionality that is again similar to that observed . this model does not give a convincing explanation for the tight correlation of @xmath5 with @xmath6 however .",
    "feedback of a very different sort was proposed by norman , sellwood & hasan ( 1996 ) , merritt & quinlan ( 1998 ) and sellwood & moore ( 1999 ) .",
    "these authors simulated the growth of massive compact objects at the centers of barred or triaxial systems and noted how the nonaxisymmetric component was weakened or dissolved when the central mass exceeded a few percent of the stellar mass .",
    "since departures from axisymmetry are believed to be crucial for channeling gas into the nucleus , the growth of the black hole has the effect of cutting off its own supply of fuel .",
    "these models , being based purely on stellar dynamics , have the nice feature that they can be _ falsified _ , and in fact they probably have been : our new understanding of black hole demographics (  2,3 ) suggests that few if any galaxies have @xmath19 as great as @xmath20 .",
    "( at the time of these studies , several galaxies were believed from ground - based data to have @xmath193 , including ngc 1399 ( magorrian 1998 ) , ngc 3115 ( kormendy 1996a ) , and ngc 4486b ( kormendy 1997 ) ) .",
    "the tightness of the @xmath1 relation must place strong constraints on the growth of black holes during mergers .",
    "we know empirically that mergers manage to keep galaxies on the fundamental plane , which is a relation between @xmath6 , the bulge effective radius @xmath194 and the surface brightness at @xmath194 .",
    "the @xmath6 that appears in the fundamental plane relation is the same @xmath30 that appears in the @xmath1 relation ( indeed , it was defined by ferrarese & merritt 2000 for just this reason ) and furthermore @xmath30 is defined within a large enough aperture that it is unlikely to be significantly affected by dynamical processes associated with the formation of a black - hole binary during a merger ( milosavljevic & merritt 2001 ) .",
    "hence the physics of the black - hole binary can be ignored and we can ask simply : how do mergers manage to grow black holes in such a way that @xmath195 , independent of changes in @xmath194 and @xmath196 ?"
