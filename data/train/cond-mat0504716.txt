    "the statistical mechanics of systems with long - range interactions is currently a topic of active research . so far ,",
    "most works have focused on the case of hamiltonian systems of particles such as the @xmath0-stars problem , the @xmath0-vortex problem or the hmf model [ 1 ] . for these systems",
    "the energy is conserved and the proper statistical description is the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the statistical evolution of the particles is described by kinetic equations such as the landau equation in astrophysics [ 2 ] or the kinetic equation derived in [ 3 ] for point vortices . since statistical ensembles",
    "are not equivalent for systems with long - range interactions , it may be of interest , at a conceptual level , to compare this microcanonical evolution with a canonical one . in that respect",
    ", we can consider a system of brownian particles in interaction .",
    "these particles are in contact with a thermal bath that imposes its temperature .",
    "therefore , they have a rigorous canonical structure and their statistical evolution is described by non - local fokker - planck equations [ 4,5 ] .    in a different context",
    ", it has been shown that tsallis generalized thermodynamics could be useful to interpret anomalous diffusion in complex systems and that the @xmath1-entropies are connected to nonlinear fokker - planck equations [ 6,7 ] .",
    "these equations can be derived from stochastic processes involving a multiplicative noise depending on the distribution function [ 8 ] .",
    "in fact , it is possible to construct a larger class of fokker - planck equations associated with a generalized thermodynamical framework encompassing tsallis and boltzmann entropies [ 9 - 12,5 ] .",
    "these generalized fokker - planck equations are obtained from standard ones by assuming that the diffusion coefficient is an arbitrary function @xmath2 of the distribution function ( the friction term can also depend on @xmath3 ) . for these equations , there exists a lyapunov functional , satisfying @xmath4 , that can be interpreted as a generalized free energy . in this context",
    ", tsallis free energy corresponds to a power - law dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 and the @xmath1 parameter in tsallis formalism is related to the exponent of anomalous diffusion .    in this paper , following [ 11 ] , we introduce a new class of fokker - planck equations associated with a generalized free energy functional _ and _ an arbitrary potential of interaction .",
    "these equations connect the two topics discussed above : long - range interactions and generalized stochastic processes .",
    "their mathematical and physical richness is considerable , as they exhibit a wide variety of canonical phase transitions and blow - up phenomena [ 13 - 17 ] . in the limit of short - range interactions ,",

    "we have derived these equations from a particular stochastic process involving a special form of multiplicative noise , but they can also arise from other types of microscopic models . in our point of view ,",
    "generalized fokker - planck equations are `` effective equations '' trying to take into account `` hidden constraints '' in complex media that are difficult to formalize [ 12 ] .",
    "since these equations decrease a functional similar to a generalized free energy , this leads naturally to a notion of `` effective thermodynamics '' .",
    "this effective approach is not in contradiction with usual thermodynamics .",
    "this is just a heuristic approach trying to deal with complex situations in which standard thermodynamics is difficult to implement .",
    "we can either use ordinary thermodynamics ( boltzmann ) and try to take into account microscopic constraints or keep only the most accessible constraints ( mass , energy , ... ) and introduce an `` effective entropy '' .",
    "this heuristic approach may be useful in certain occasions when an exact description of the system s dynamics is difficult to implement .",
    "generalized thermodynamics is justified when all the accessible microstates are _ not _ equiprobable due to additional microscopic constraints .",
    "these constraints can be due to quantum mechanics ( pauli exclusion principle ) , to the existence of a lattice , to hard sphere effects , to a fractal structure of phase space , etc .",
    "we emphasize that our formalism is valid for more general functionals than the tsallis entropy .",
    "tsallis entropy forms , however , an important class of functionals associated with polytropic distributions and power - laws . these distributions generate a natural form of self - confinement that can be of interest in nonextensive systems . however , it was our interest here to show that a more general formalism could be developed consistently .",
    "a notion of `` generalized thermodynamics '' , with a different presentation and a different motivation , has been developed independently by kaniadakis [ 9 ] , frank [ 10 ] and naudts [ 19 ] .",
    "the non - local fokker - planck equations introduced in this paper can be of interest in different fields of physics , with various interpretations . in the usual case where they are associated with the boltzmann entropy",
    ", they describe a gas of brownian particles in interaction [ 4,5 ] .",
    "therefore , they constitute the canonical counterpart of the microcanonical kinetic equations ( boltzmann , landau , lenard - balescu , ... ) describing hamiltonian systems of particles in interaction [ 2,3 ] .",
    "they are thus interesting at a conceptual level to test _ dynamically _ situations of ensemble inequivalence for systems with long - range interactions .",
    "for example , the `` isothermal collapse '' of self - gravitating brownian particles described by the smoluchowski - poisson system [ 13 - 16 ] can be compared with the `` gravothermal catastrophe '' of the hamiltonian @xmath0-stars system described by the landau - poisson system ( or by the orbit averaged fokker - planck equation ) .",
    "similarly , the smoluchowski - poisson system for brownian point vortices can be contrasted with the kinetic equation obtained in [ 3 ] from the hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "they exhibit a very different behaviour illustrating the inequivalence of statistical ensembles .    at a practical level",
    ", the generalized fokker - planck equations presented in this paper and in [ 11 ] can be used as numerical algorithms to compute explicitly nonlinearly dynamically stable stationary solutions of the vlasov and euler equations . in that context , the generalized entropy @xmath79 is interpreted as a casimir functional or a @xmath80-function [ 20 ] .",
    "its maximization at fixed energy and mass ( or circulation ) determines a condition of dynamical stability , not a condition of thermodynamical stability .",
    "the fact that this variational principle looks similar to the variational principle that occurs in thermodynamics is essentially a _",
    "thermodynamical analogy _ [ 11 ] .",
    "since the generalized fokker - planck equations introduced in [ 11 ] increase the functional @xmath81 while conserving @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) , they can be used as physical algorithms to construct arbitrary nonlinearly dynamically stable stationary solutions of the vlasov ( or euler ) equation .",
    "such stationary solutions can arise in practice as a result of a ( possibly incomplete ) violent relaxation , leading to a metaequilibrium state on the coarse - grained scale [ 21,11,12 ] .    finally ,",
    "non - local drift - diffusion equations isomorphic to the smoluchowski - poisson system have a real interest in biology in relation with the concept of chemotaxis ( see [ 17 ] for a description of the analogy between self - gravitating brownian particles and bacterial populations ) .",
    "now , it has been noted that the diffusion of bacteries is anomalous in general so that the diffusion coefficient which appears in the drift - diffusion equation depends on the density .",
    "this leads to a notion of `` effective '' generalized thermodynamics .",
    "this is simply because the true dynamics is so complex that it is replaced by a simple equation with an `` ad hoc '' diffusion coefficient whose specific form has to be deduced from experiments ( this illustrates what we mean by `` hidden constraints '' ) . accordingly , different forms of `` generalized free energy '' functionals can arise in biology depending on the context .    in conclusion , the generalized fokker - planck equations presented in this paper and in [ 11 ] can be of considerable interest , in particular in the case of long - range interactions where they exhibit a rich variety of canonical phase transitions .",
    "a systematic study of this new class of equations has been initiated in [ 13 - 17 ] ."
