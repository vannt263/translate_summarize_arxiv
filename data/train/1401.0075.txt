    "axial killing fields play an important role in classical general relativity when defining the angular momentum of a black hole or a similar compact , gravitating body .",
    "the simplest example is the komar angular momentum , which applies to regions of spacetime that admit a global axial killing field @xmath1 .",
    "the formula is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a spacelike 2-sphere , @xmath4 is the area bivector normal to @xmath3 , @xmath5 is the extrinsic curvature of a cauchy surface @xmath6 containing @xmath3 , @xmath7 is the spacelike normal to @xmath3 within @xmath6 , and @xmath8 is the intrinsic area element on @xmath3",
    ". similar integrals  such as the quasi - local formulae due to brown and york @xcite and for dynamical horizons @xcite  apply more generally , when only the _",
    "intrinsic , two - dimensional _ metric on @xmath3 is symmetric .",
    "but the definition of each does rely on the existence of such an intrinsic symmetry .    in order to justify an integral like ( [ komar ] ) as a physical angular momentum",
    ", @xmath1 should have some standard , global characteristics of an axial killing field .",
    "in particular , for a general riemannian geometry @xmath9 , these characteristics include that    1 .",
    "@xmath1 vanishes at at least one fixed point @xmath10 , 2 .",
    "every orbit of the flow @xmath11 generated by @xmath1 is either a fixed point or a circle , and 3 .",
    "all of the circular orbits close only at integer multiples of a common period @xmath12 .",
    "one may then scale @xmath1 by a constant as needed so that @xmath13 , the standard period for a group of rigid rotations .",
    "the angular momenta mentioned above take unique values only when one restricts to this preferred normalization .",
    "if @xmath14 happens to be a ( topological ) 2-sphere , then condition ( a ) is usually strengthened to    1 .",
    "@xmath1 vanishes at exactly two fixed points @xmath15 and @xmath16 in @xmath14 .",
    "these conditions distill the intuitive , geometric features of axial symmetries in standard geometries ( _ i.e. _ , euclidean , gaussian , or lobachevskian ) .",
    "the purpose of this note is to show that the conditions above are redundant .",
    "the _ global _ conditions ( b ) and ( c )  as well as condition ( a ) when @xmath14  derive from condition ( a ) and one other _ local _ condition at @xmath15 , which is that @xmath17 that is , any killing field @xmath1 with at least one fixed point @xmath15 , whose derivative satisfies the local condition ( [ fcon ] ) , is necessarily an axial killing field in the global sense described above .",
    "furthermore , ( [ fcon ] ) _ always _ holds if @xmath18 is 2- or 3-dimensional , so in those cases any killing field with a fixed point is an axial killing field .",
    "finally , every vector field on a 2-sphere must vanish at at least one point , so every killing field on a 2-sphere is axial .",
    "condition ( a ) then follows by a topological argument .",
    "one can also show that conditions ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) hold whenever @xmath14 is a 2-sphere ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see  3 ) using the classical uniformization theorem : every metric @xmath19 on a 2-sphere is conformally related to a round metric @xmath20 .",
    "any killing field of @xmath19 must also be a killing field of @xmath20 , and therefore must satisfy conditions ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) .",
    "the approach we take here is more direct , and actually lays the foundation @xcite for a proof of the uniformization theorem via ricci flow @xcite . here",
    "we extend this direct approach to arbitrary riemannian geometries and highlight its utility in physical applications .",
    "the global flow @xmath11 generated by a killing field @xmath1 on a riemannian manifold @xmath9 is closely related to the corresponding inifnitesimal flow @xmath21 induced on the tangent space @xmath22 at any point @xmath15 where @xmath1 vanishes .",
    "the key point is that the latter form a subgroup of the symmetry group @xmath23 for the euclidean geometry @xmath24 .",
    "the natural flow @xmath21 in the tangent space at @xmath15 consists of the differentials @xmath25 of the diffeomorphisms @xmath11 in the global flow on @xmath18 .",
    "the differential of a diffeomorphism @xmath26 is just the natural push - forward map @xmath27 on vectors .",
    "if @xmath28 is fixed , then @xmath29 becomes a linear map from the tangent space @xmath30 to itself .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath31 is a global isometry of the riemannian geometry @xmath9 that fixes @xmath32 , then @xmath29 is a linear isometry of the euclidean geometry @xmath33 .",
    "it follows that @xmath34 is a one - parameter group of linear isometries of a eucliean vector space",
    ". they must be rotational isometries , not translational , because they fix the origin of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , each orbit of @xmath21 must either be a fixed point or a circle .",
    "this is the tangent - space analogue ( b@xmath35 ) of condition ( b ) above .",
    "next , recall that the lie derivative along @xmath1 of a vector field @xmath36 is defined in terms of the push - forward under the flow @xmath11 generated by @xmath1 : @xmath37_{t = 0}.\\ ] ] when @xmath1 vanishes at @xmath38 , this determines the generator , in the ordinary sense of matrices , of the one - parameter group of linear isometries @xmath21 via @xmath39_{t = 0 }           = - \\lie_\\varphi\\ , v^b \\bigr|_{p_0 }          = v^a\\ , \\grad\\!_a\\ , \\varphi^b \\bigr|_{p_0}.\\ ] ] thus , the tensor @xmath40 from ( [ fcon ] ) generates the rotations @xmath21 in @xmath22 in the sense that @xmath41 one can always find an orthonormal basis for @xmath24 that puts an anti - symmetric tensor like @xmath40 in canonical , block - diagonal form with one or more @xmath42 anti - symmetric blocks along the diagonal , possibly followed by one or more zeroes .",
    "there can be at most one non - zero block if @xmath18 is 2- or 3-dimensional , but in higher dimensions there may be several . in principle , each block could have a different pair of values @xmath43 for its off - diagonal elements .",
    "but the period of @xmath44 within the 2-dimensional subspace of @xmath22 corresponding to one of these blocks is @xmath45 .",
    "these periods are equal if ( [ fcon ] ) holds because , working in the preferred basis , we have @xmath46 for each @xmath47 .",
    "thus , ( [ fcon ] ) yields the tangent - space analogue ( c@xmath35 ) of condition ( c ) .",
    "to summarize , the rigid , euclidean geometry of @xmath24 suffices to prove the tangent - space analogues of our claims above .",
    "more precisely , we have shown that    1 .",
    "the 1-parameter group of linear isometries @xmath21 fixes the origin in @xmath22 , _ whence _ 2 .",
    "every other orbit of @xmath21 in @xmath22 is either a fixed point or a circle , and 3 .",
    "all of those circular orbits close for a common period @xmath12 as long as ( [ fcon ] ) holds .",
    "in addition , ( [ fcon ] ) holds identically if @xmath18 is 2- or 3-dimensional . finally , note that the natural normalization of @xmath40 sets each @xmath48 , which is equivalent to @xmath49 this one normalization condition implies that _ all _ orbits of @xmath21 close at @xmath13 .",
    "the results in the tangent space @xmath22 extend back to the whole manifold @xmath18 essentially because the global isometries @xmath11 map geodesics of @xmath9 to other geodesics . recall the exponential map @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the unique geodesic of @xmath9 starting from @xmath52 , having initial tangent @xmath53 , and affinely parameterized so that @xmath54 for all @xmath55 .",
    "each global isometry @xmath11 maps this geodesic to another one , @xmath56 , which of course has its initial tangent rotated in @xmath22 . in short , @xmath57 for all @xmath58 and all @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath18 is connected , compact , and without boundary , then there exists at least one geodesic between @xmath15 and any of its other points .",
    "it therefore follows from ( [ pcomm ] ) that every orbit of @xmath11 in @xmath18 must be the image under the exponential map of at least one orbit of @xmath21 in @xmath22 . the exponential generally is not invertible , of course , so the orbit in @xmath22 generally is not unique . but the orbits of @xmath11 can not intersect one another , or themselves , non - trivially .",
    "thus , although the exponential mapping of orbits may be many - to - one , and may map circular orbits of @xmath21 to fixed - point orbits of @xmath11 , it nonetheless preserves orbits .",
    "it follows in particular that each orbit of @xmath11 must either be a fixed point or a closed circle . in other words ,",
    "condition ( b ) for the orbits of @xmath11 follows from condition ( b@xmath35 ) for the orbits of @xmath21 .",
    "it is also clear that every circular orbit of @xmath11 must close with the same period as one of the orbits of @xmath21 that is mapped to it by the exponential .",
    "but all orbits of @xmath21 have the same period as long as ( [ fcon ] ) holds , and condition ( c ) for the orbits of @xmath11 then follows from condition ( c@xmath35 ) for the orbits of @xmath21 .    let us summarize the chain of arguments here . condition ( a ) on a killing field on a riemannian geometry @xmath9 implies condition ( a@xmath35 ) for the linear isometries @xmath21 of the euclidean geometry @xmath24 .",
    "this in turn implies conditions ( b@xmath35 ) and ( c@xmath35 ) , as long as ( [ fcon ] ) holds .",
    "finally , these imply conditions ( b ) and ( c ) globally on @xmath18 via the exponential map .",
    "note that the _ local _ normalization condition ( [ fnorm ] ) at @xmath15 therefore dictates the _ global _ scaling of the killing field @xmath1 such that all of its orbits have the desired period @xmath13 .",
    "every vector field , and thus every killing field , on a 2-sphere @xmath3 vanishes at at least one point , and ( [ fcon ] ) holds identically in 2 dimensions .",
    "every killing field on a 2-sphere therefore satisfies conditions ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) .",
    "but the intuitive picture of an axial killing field on a 2-sphere is that it should vanish at exactly two poles , as in condition ( a ) , not just at a single point .",
    "we now show that this is necessarily the case .",
    "suppose that a 2-sphere geometry @xmath60 admits an axial killing field @xmath1 , which we take to be normalized according to ( [ fnorm ] ) .",
    "each point @xmath61 in @xmath3 lies on a unique orbit of @xmath1 , which divides the sphere into two regions .",
    "let @xmath62 denote the area of the region bounded by that orbit and containing the fixed point @xmath15 .",
    "equivalently @xcite , we may set @xmath63 the smooth function @xmath62 takes both maximum and minimum values somewhere on the ( compact ) sphere , and each must occur at a fixed point where @xmath64 vanishes .",
    "the minimum value is zero , and occurs only at @xmath38 .",
    "the maximum value @xmath65 also occurs at a fixed point @xmath16 , which can not coincide with @xmath15 because any fixed point of @xmath1 must be _ one - sided_. that is , the local topology of @xmath66 is that of the 2-dimensional plane , so the fixed points of @xmath1 must be isolated from one another , and each must be surrounded by a _",
    "single _ family of circular orbits .",
    "( if two distinct families of circular orbits surrounded a given fixed point , then @xmath3 would have the local topology of a two - sided cone there . ) similarly , every circular orbit of @xmath1 must be _ two - sided _ in the sense that there are exactly two distinct families of circular orbits surrounding it .",
    "( there can not be only one such family because @xmath3 has no boundary , and there can not be more than two because this would violate the assumed manifold structure of @xmath3 at each point of such an orbit . )",
    "the manifold of orbits @xmath67 of @xmath1 therefore has the topology of a closed interval @xmath68 $ ] , with exactly two fixed points at the two ends and only circular orbits in the interior .",
    "thus , @xmath1 must have exactly two isolated fixed points .",
    "finally , we show that the exponential map maps a closed disk with _ finite _",
    "radius @xmath69 in @xmath70 onto _ all _ of @xmath3 , with the entire circular boundary of that disk mapped to the conjugate fixed point @xmath71 .",
    "this mapping is invertible in the interior of the disk , but obviously not on the boundary . to see this ,",
    "observe that @xmath72{\\dot\\gamma_v(s ) } = 0      \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad      \\grad\\!_{\\dot\\gamma_v(s)}\\ , \\bigl ( \\varphi \\cdot \\dot\\gamma_v(s ) \\bigr ) = 0\\ ] ] because @xmath51 in ( [ expdef ] ) is an affinely parameterized geodesic and @xmath1 is a killing field .",
    "it follows that the tangent to @xmath51 has constant norm equal to @xmath73 for all @xmath55 and , since @xmath1 vanishes at @xmath15 , is everywhere orthogonal to the circular orbits of @xmath1 .",
    "the proper distance in @xmath3 along @xmath51 from @xmath15 to @xmath74 is therefore equal to @xmath73 in @xmath75 .",
    "( this holds generally , not just on the 2-sphere . )",
    "it also follows from ( [ gprop ] ) that the proper geodetic distance from @xmath15 to @xmath16 is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the proper radius of the orbit of @xmath1 through any given point , and primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath78 .",
    "this integral is irregular because @xmath79 vanishes at both endpoints .",
    "but the integral converges nonetheless because the conditions to avoid conical singularities in @xmath3 at @xmath15 and @xmath16 are @xmath80 thus , although @xmath81 diverges at both endpoints in ( [ sigint ] ) , the indefinite integral of @xmath82 vanishes like @xmath79 near @xmath83 .",
    "the difference @xmath84 likewise vanishes like @xmath79 near @xmath85 .",
    "there can be no other irregular points with @xmath86 , so the integral ( [ sigint ] ) is well - defined and @xmath69 is finite .",
    "we have seen that any killing field @xmath1 that vanishes at at least one point @xmath15 in a riemannian manifold @xmath9 , and satisfies ( [ fcon ] ) there , necessarily has only fixed - point and closed , circular orbits throughout @xmath18 , the latter all having the same period @xmath87 .",
    "this offers a convenient way to characterize axial killing fields in terms of local data at a fixed point .",
    "furthermore , scaling @xmath1 globally such that ( [ fnorm ] ) holds locally at @xmath15 guarantees that the period of every circular orbit is @xmath0 .",
    "the condition ( [ fcon ] ) is not needed in 2 or 3 dimensions , and in fact one might imagine abandoning it altogether for manifolds of arbitrary dimension .",
    "the main disadvantage of this would be that some orbits of @xmath21 may no longer be closed .",
    "rather , if some of the @xmath88 from ( [ fivals ] ) were incommensurate , some orbits @xmath21 would densely fill a torus in @xmath22 . the same would then apply to the orbits of @xmath11 by the same methods used above . although this would be rather less convenient , and less physical ,",
    "such `` quasi - axial '' symmetries could potentially be interesting in certain applications .",
    "one additional feature of these results is that they suggest a natural and convenient way to normalize an _ approximate _ killing field on a riemannian geometry @xmath9 that has no actual symmetries @xcite .",
    "namely , suppose that a candidate approximate killing field @xmath89 can be found up to constant scaling on @xmath18 and vanishes at at least one point , which again is guaranteed if @xmath14 .",
    "then , one may define @xmath90}$ ] , and use ( [ fnorm ] ) to normalize @xmath89 throughout @xmath18 without having to compute the orbits of @xmath89 and ensure that they close , etc .",
    "we explore this proposal further in a companion paper @xcite ."
