    "the discovery of superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite has generated renewed interest in this material @xcite . originally the main motivation in ref .",
    "@xcite was the close similarity of its crystal structure with that of high temperature superconducting oxide la@xmath7ca@xmath8cuo@xmath1 .",
    "however , unlike cuprates , strontium ruthenate is metallic without doping and is not readily superconducting . indeed , very pure single crystals have superconducting transition temperature @xmath9k , rather low on the scale of the high t@xmath10 cuprates .    in the normal state",
    "the electrons in strontium ruthenate form a well behaved , albeit anisotropic and correlated , fermi liquid . in particular the resistivity shows a typical quadratic dependence on temperature @xmath11 at low temperatures . here",
    "@xmath12 is the ` residual ' resistivity measured at temperature just above @xmath3 and @xmath13 denotes the direction of the current ( @xmath14 for in plane and @xmath15 for c - axis resistivity ) .",
    "electronic transport is very anisotropic with the ratio of @xmath16 exceeding 500 .",
    "normal state electronic specific heat shows a typical linear dependence on temperature , @xmath17 , with a high value of @xmath18 mj / k@xmath19 mol .",
    "the appreciable enhancement ( factor 3 - 5 ) of @xmath6 over the band structure calculations indicates the existence of strong carrier correlations in the system .",
    "the same conclusion can also be drawn from the enhanced value of the ratio between pauli spin - susceptibility and @xmath6 ( wilson ratio ) and the so called kadowaki - woods ratio of the coefficient @xmath20 to @xmath6 .",
    "these values exceeds those for non - correlated systems .",
    "consistent with the above picture is the fact that first - principles calculations based on the local density approximation ( lda ) give a good qualitative account of the electronic structure @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum around the fermi level of strontium ruthenate is dominated by electrons occupying @xmath21 orbitals ( @xmath22,@xmath23,@xmath24 ) of @xmath25 .",
    "the fermi surface consists of three cylindrical sheets open in the z - direction .",
    "those called @xmath4 and @xmath5 stem from hybridised @xmath22 and @xmath23 orbitals , while the @xmath6 sheet is mainly of @xmath24 character .",
    "the @xmath4 sheet is a hole fermi surface .",
    "it is centered at the point @xmath26 of the bct brillouin zone and possesses two fold symmetry .",
    "the calculated shape of the fermi surfaces agrees nicely with that measured _ via _ de haas",
    " van alphen effect @xcite .",
    "while the normal state , as shown above , is quite typical of a good metal , the superconducting state is very exotic .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 is strongly suppressed by even small amount of impurities @xcite .",
    "the nmr measured relaxation rate shows no hebel - slichter peak , and the @xmath27sr experiments indicate the appearance of spontaneous magnetic fields at @xmath28 . together with a temperature independent knight shift , all that points towards very unconventional , presumably spin - triplet , and superconductivity with a time reversal symmetry breaking pairing state .",
    "because the electrons forming cooper pairs in superconductors are fermions , the pair wave function has to be odd with respect to interchange .",
    "it consists of spin and orbital components .",
    "if the total spin of a pair is zero then such a pairing state is called spin - singlet .",
    "the corresponding spin - wave function is odd so the orbital part has to be even . in galilean invariant systems they correspond to even values of the orbital quantum number @xmath29 and the corresponding superconducting states",
    "are referred to as having @xmath30,@xmath31 , @xmath32 wave symmetry .",
    "the @xmath30wave symmetry is realised in conventional superconductors , while @xmath31wave is the case in high temperature superconductors .",
    "the electrons in strontium ruthenate most probably pair in relative spin triplet state .",
    "their spin wave function is even and thus the orbital one has to be odd . even though a crystal has only discreet rotational symmetry , the corresponding symmetries of the superconducting state are still called @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath32 wave .    as well known , a relatively weak dependence of @xmath3 on the concentration of impurities and an exponential dependence of the electron specific heat on temperature point to spin singlet s - wave superconductivity . on the other hand",
    "a power law temperature dependence of specific heat is characteristic of a superconducting gap which vanishes at points or along lines on the fermi surface , and a dramatic decrease of @xmath3 with impurity concentration is a signal of @xmath35 ` wave ' paring .",
    "the puzzling behaviour of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 in the superconducting state is connected with the facts that nmr , @xmath27sr and related experiments indicate the realisation of the @xmath36 state which does not vanish at the fermi level and that the power law temperature dependence of the specific heat @xcite , penetration depth @xcite or thermal conductivity @xcite which require the gap to vanish along lines of the fermi surface .",
    "the point is that out of all the symmetry distinct states of a bct crystal @xcite none of the odd - parity states have to be time reversal symmetry breaking and also possess gap nodes at the same time ( _ c.f .",
    "_ table i ) . the various states , formally fulfilling both requirements proposed in literature @xcite can be shown to be the sum of symmetry allowed states with distinct transition temperatures .",
    "the single superconducting transition observed in all studied samples rules out all these proposals as the single transition could only be a result of accidental degeneracy . instead of relying on a symmetry arguments alone",
    ", we present a methodology which is based on explicit construction of an effective pairing interaction .",
    ".[tableone ] irreducible representations in a tetragonal crystal .",
    "the symbols @xmath26 , @xmath37 @xmath38 represent any functions transforming as @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 under crystal point group operations , while @xmath42 represents any function which is invariant under all point group symmetries .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in choosing the interaction parameters @xmath43 we adopted a frankly semi phenomenological approach .",
    "namely , we eschewed any effort to derive these from an assumed physical mechanism of pairing and endeavoured to find a minimal , hopefully unique , set of parameters which describes the available data .",
    "the point of such strategy is that at the end we can claim to have identified the position and orbital dependence of the interaction and therefore provided guidance for constructing microscopic models for specific mechanisms .    in the above spirit we consider two sets of interaction constants : @xmath44 for nearest neighbours in the plane and @xmath45 for nearest - neighbour ru - atoms in the adjacent plane as indicated in fig .",
    "2 . to limit further the parameter space we need to explore , we assume that @xmath46 , @xmath47 and contemplate only @xmath48 in fact , we take @xmath49 for most of our calculations and we use only one in plane , @xmath50 , and one out of plane @xmath51 , parameters to fit the experimental data on the specific heat , @xmath52 , superfluid density @xmath53 and the thermal conductivity @xmath54 . the purpose of the few calculations with @xmath55 , @xmath56 was only to investigate the stability of the @xmath57 results to variations in @xmath44 and @xmath58 .    within the above model",
    ", we solved the bogolubov - de gennes equations : @xmath59 together with the self - consistency condition @xmath60 which follow from eq .",
    "( 1 ) on making the usual bcs - like mean field approximation@xcite . since @xmath61 and @xmath62 depend only on the difference @xmath63 the solution of eq . ( 3 ) is rendered tractable by taking its lattice fourier transforms and , thus transforming the problem into that of a 12 @xmath64 12 matrix , eigenvalue problem at each @xmath65 in the appropriate brillouin zone .",
    "for @xmath49 the general structure of @xmath66 turns out to be of the form @xmath67 for @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "our self - consistency procedure always converged on the amplitudes @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 to an accuracy higher than 10@xmath75% .",
    "the principle results of such calculations are these amplitudes and the corresponding quasiparticle energy eigenvalues @xmath76 .",
    "these eigenvalues are shown in fig .",
    "3 , for the interaction values @xmath50 , @xmath51 given in table 2 , and with the constraint that @xmath77 . evidently from the figure , on the @xmath6 sheet there is an absolute gap below @xmath78 , in the quasi - particle spectrum , while the @xmath5 sheet is gapless with a line of nodes in the gap functions at @xmath79 this dramatically different gap structure and symmetry on different sheets of the fermi surface is the striking new results of an interaction matrix @xmath80 which couples electrons in different ru - planes .    from the results in fig .",
    "3 , one is encouraged to investigate this form of interaction further because , on the one hand , the line of zero gap on the @xmath5 sheet explains the power - law behaviour of various thermodynamic quantities and , on the other , on the fully gapped @xmath6 sheet @xmath81 which implies the broken time reversal symmetry demanded by a number of other experiments . indeed , for the above pair of interactions , @xmath51 and @xmath50 , and the corresponding quasiparticle spectra we find the specific heat @xmath52 shown in fig .",
    "4 as a function of @xmath82 .",
    "although these parameters were chosen to fit the experimental data which is also shown , the agreement between theory and experiment is truly remarkable .",
    "the point to appreciate is that in general two different @xmath50 and @xmath51 imply two separate transitions at @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "thus , to agree with the experiments which features a single transition at @xmath85  k we had to use both degrees of freedoms .",
    "namely , fitting @xmath3 determined both coupling constants @xmath51 and @xmath50 .",
    "now , one might suggest that it is a short - coming of our model that we have to rely on such an accidental coincidence of @xmath50 and @xmath51 to fit one number @xmath86 .",
    "however , in the light of the very good fit to the very non trivial experimental variation of @xmath87 with temperature this is not a strong objection .",
    "indeed , the fact that having fitted to @xmath88 only and we have reproduced the slope as @xmath82 goes to zero and the size of the jump at @xmath3 has to be regarded as a confirmation of our model .",
    "our calculations @xcite of the superfluid density @xmath53 @xcite and thermal conductivity @xmath89 @xcite , for the same parameters as above , provide further evidence in support of our model .",
    "note that these calculations do not involve additional adjustable parameters and thus the results are not only qualitative consequences of nodes of the gap on the @xmath4 and @xmath5 sheets of the fermi surface but are also quantitative predictions of the theory .    in what follows",
    "we conclude this brief survey of our very encouraging results by two further important comments .",
    "the first concerns the constraints @xmath90 imposed at each step of the selfconsistency cycle during the above calculations . without this constraint",
    "there would be a second transition @xmath91 , where @xmath92 becomes non zero and this would imply a peak in @xmath52 at @xmath93  k , which has not been seen experimentally .",
    "fortunately , we have been able to show by explicit quantitative calculations that a small amount of disorder will eliminate the @xmath94 component of the order parameters without changing the other amplitudes in eq .",
    "( 4 ) very much .",
    "the details of these calculations will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this justifies , at the present level of the mean - free path in samples on which the experiments were made , the simultaneous neglect of disorder and the @xmath95-component @xmath92 .",
    "the other comment is that we have studied the stability of the above model ( eqs . 1 - 5 , fig .",
    "5 ) to introducing further interaction constants and found it to be satisfactorily robust .",
    "in particular we have carried a number of calculations with @xmath96 and @xmath56 and , as we shall report in a separate publication , we found @xcite that the overall picture presented above remained the same .",
    "namely , our conclusion that a model with just two interaction constants , one in plane @xmath50 , and one out of plane @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "4 ) roughly of the same size , around 50  mev , is capable of explaining all the available data we have analysed remained valid .",
