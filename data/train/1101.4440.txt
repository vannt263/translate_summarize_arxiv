    "the fabrication of junctions made of small molecules seems by now well established .",
    "@xcite the transport properties of such molecular junctions are largely determined by the interplay between the electrical and the vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "these include the couplings of the bridge with the leads , as well as the resonance energies .",
    "their effects on the dc conductance of such junctions have been examined in many works ( see below ) . here",
    "we study the ac conductance , concentrating on the modulation of the frequency dependence brought about by the coupling to the vibrational modes .",
    "our calculation is confined to the linear - response regime , and is carried out to second order in the coupling with the vibrational modes .    the simplest model for describing this system assigns a single electronic level , @xmath0 , to the molecule , which is connected via two leads to two electronic reservoirs .",
    "those are kept at different chemical potentials . when electrons pass through the molecule , they are coupled to its vibrational modes . since the molecule has a finite size , those modes have finite frequencies ; in the simplest approach and at very low temperatures , they may be represented by a single vibrational frequency , @xmath1 , treated within the einstein model .",
    "various approximate numerical and analytical schemes have been developed for treating this model .",
    "the dc current - voltage characteristics have been studied by the perturbation theory , @xcite the rate equations,@xcite and monte carlo methods.@xcite furthermore , the shot noise and the full counting statistics of the charge passing the junction have been studied by perturbation theory , @xcite rate equations , @xcite and the polaron approximation.@xcite    in the linear - response regime , the breit - wigner resonance of the dc conductance ( as a function of the equilibrium chemical potential @xmath2 , and at very low temperatures ) is _ narrowed down _ by the electron - vibration ( e - v ) interaction , due to the renormalization of the tunnel coupling between the molecule and the leads ( the frank - condon blockade ) .",
    "@xcite however , the e - v interaction _ does not _ yield side peaks in the conductance at energies corresponding to the molecule vibrational frequencies , as long as it is not large enough to induce polaronic phase transitions . for such peaks to arise ( at zero temperature and at small values of the e - v coupling )",
    ", the electron needs to lose an energy @xmath1 ( we use @xmath3 ) in order to excite a vibrational mode , and this is not possible in the linear - response regime .",
    "such side peaks will appear ( at zero temperature ) in the _",
    "nonlinear-_response regime , where the finite voltage , @xmath4 , allows for the opening of inelastic channels when @xmath5 exceeds @xmath6 .@xcite side peaks can be induced by a finite temperature , but their height will be minute , reflecting the number of available vibrational modes . @xcite",
    "the ac conductance of molecular junctions , in particular the effects of the e - v interaction on its frequency dependence , has been studied to lesser extent .",
    "recently , kubala and marquardt @xcite wrote down expressions for the ac conductance of interacting electrons traversing molecular junctions , in the case where the dc voltage is finite , while the ac one is very small , including as an example the e - v interaction .",
    "our expressions ( which are derived by a different approach ) agree with theirs in the zero - dc bias limit .",
    "in addition , we give details of an extra diagram [ ( d ) in fig . [ fig : fig1 ] ] which they chose to ignore ( because it vanishes in the dc limit ) , and present a detailed discussion of the dependence of the ac conductance on the various parameters .",
    "as we show , the e - v interaction generates four contributions to the ac conductance .",
    "the first two are a hartree and an exchange terms .",
    "in addition , the kubo formula for the ac conductance also contains two vertex corrections . in the keldysh",
    "formalism,@xcite the vertex corrections correspond to an expansion of the self energies in the time - dependent chemical potentials of the left and right reservoirs , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "these corrections cause the ac conductance to diverge when the frequency @xmath9 of the applied ac voltage crosses @xmath1 ; the imaginary part of the green function of the vibrational mode is infinitesimally small to second - order in the e - v coupling . to avoid this divergence , a finite lifetime of the vibrational modes should be included .",
    "two effects can be considered which contribute to this lifetime .",
    "one is the relaxation due to the coupling with bulk phonons in the substrate .",
    "we denote this relaxation rate by @xmath10 ; the other involves the electrical polarization , which results from the coupling of the vibrational mode with the transport electrons .",
    "the latter effect is dominant for floating molecules , air - bridged between the electrodes ( in the absence of the substrate).@xcite we discuss this case in sec .",
    "[ summary ] and in appendix [ pola ] .",
    "the contributions of the vertex corrections to the ac conductance are proportional to the combination @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the broadening of the energy level representing the molecule due to its coupling with the left ( right ) lead .",
    "choosing a symmetric configuration , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , causes these contributions to vanish .",
    "therefore , in this symmetric case the ac conductance is affected by the e - v interaction only via the hartree and the exchange ( fock ) contributions .",
    "as we show , the former contribution is usually dominant , causing a relatively small increase ( larger decrease ) of the ac conductance when the average chemical potential in the leads , @xmath2 , is below ( above ) the electronic level @xmath0 on the molecule . similar to the dc conductance",
    ", this causes a narrowing of the ac conductance ( plotted versus @xmath2 ) .",
    "since the exchange contribution is even in @xmath15 , subtracting the conductances above and below @xmath0 can yield information on the hartree contribution . when the junction is not fully symmetric",
    ", the vertex corrections introduce an additional structure in the frequency dependence of the ac conductance , especially near @xmath16 .",
