    "the search for a mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking , and in particular for a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , has been a major goal of particle physics for many years , and is a central part of the fermilab tevatron physics program , and also that of the large hadron collider .",
    "recently , the atlas and cms collaborations at the large hadron collider have released results on searches for the standard model higgs boson decaying to @xmath3  @xcite , @xmath9  @xcite , @xmath10  @xcite both the cdf and collaborations have performed new combinations  @xcite of multiple direct searches for the sm higgs boson .",
    "the new searches cover a larger data sample , and incorporate improved analysis techniques compared to previous analyses .",
    "the sensitivities of these new combinations significantly exceed those of previous combinations  @xcite .    in this note , we combine the most recent results of searches for the sm higgs boson produced in  collisions at  .",
    "the analyses combined here seek signals of higgs bosons produced in association with vector bosons ( @xmath11 ) , through gluon - gluon fusion ( @xmath12 ) , and through vector boson fusion ( vbf ) ( @xmath13 ) corresponding to integrated luminosities up to 7.1  at cdf and up to 8.2  at d0 .",
    "the searches included here target higgs boson decays to @xmath3 , although acceptance for decays into @xmath4 and @xmath5 are included in the d0 channels .",
    "the searches are separated into 46 mutually exclusive final states ( 12 for cdf and 34 for d0 ; see tables  [ tab : cdfacc ] and  [ tab : dzacc ] ) referred to as `` analysis sub - channels '' in this note .",
    "the selection procedures for each analysis are detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite through  @xcite , and are briefly described below .",
    "event selections are similar for the corresponding cdf and d0 analyses .    for the  analyses which seek events in which both @xmath14 bosons decay leptonically , signal events are characterized by large  and two oppositely - signed , isolated leptons .",
    "the presence of neutrinos in the final state prevents the accurate reconstruction of the candidate higgs boson mass .",
    "d0 selects events containing large  and electrons and/or muons , dividing the data sample into three final states : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . the searches in the three final states each use 8.1 fb@xmath18 of data which is subdivided according to the number of jets in the event : 0 , 1 , or 2 or more ( `` 2 + '' ) jets .",
    "decays involving tau leptons are included in two orthogonal ways .",
    "for the first time , a dedicated analysis ( @xmath19 ) using 7.3 fb@xmath18 of data studying the final state involving a muon and a hadronic tau decay , is included in the tevatron combination .",
    "final states involving other tau decays and mis - identified hadronic tau decays are included in the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 final state analyses .",
    "cdf separates the  events in five non - overlapping samples , split into both `` high @xmath20 '' and `` low @xmath20 '' categories based on lepton types and different categories based on the number of reconstructed jets : 0 , 1 , or 2 + jets . the sample with two or more jets is not split into low @xmath20 and high @xmath20 lepton categories due to low statistics .",
    "a sixth cdf channel is the low dilepton mass ( @xmath21 ) channel , which accepts events with @xmath22  gev .",
    "this channel increases the sensitivity of the @xmath23 analyses at low @xmath24 , adding 10% additional acceptance at @xmath25  gev .",
    "the division of events into jet categories allows the analysis discriminants to separate three different categories of signals from the backgrounds more effectively .",
    "the signal production mechanisms considered are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and vector - boson fusion .",
    "the d0 @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 final state channels use boosted decision tree outputs as the final discriminants while the @xmath19 channel uses neural networks .",
    "cdf uses neural - network outputs , including likelihoods constructed from calculated matrix - element probabilities as additional inputs for the 0-jet bin .",
    "d0 includes  analyses in which the associated vector boson and the @xmath14 boson from the higgs boson decay that has the same charge are required to decay leptonically , thereby defining three like - sign dilepton final states ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ) .",
    "the combined output of two decision trees , trained against the instrumental and diboson backgrounds respectively , is used as the final discriminant .",
    "cdf also includes a separate analysis of events with same - sign leptons and large  to incorporate additional potential signal from associated production events in which the two leptons ( one from the associated vector boson and one from a @xmath14 boson produced in the higgs decay ) have the same charge .",
    "cdf for the first time also incorporates three tri - lepton channels to include additional associated production contributions where leptons result from the associated @xmath14 boson and the two @xmath14 bosons produced in the higgs decay or where an associated @xmath31 boson decays into a dilepton pair and a third lepton is produced in the decay of either of the @xmath14 bosons resulting from the higgs decay . in the latter case , cdf separates the sample into 1 jet and 2 + jet sub - channels to fully take advantage of the higgs mass constraint available in the 2 + jet case where all of the decay products are reconstructed .",
    "cdf also includes opposite - sign channels in which one of the two lepton candidates is a hadronic tau .",
    "events are separated into @xmath32-@xmath33 and @xmath34-@xmath33 channels .",
    "the final discriminants are obtained from boosted decision trees which incorporate both hadronic tau identification and kinematic event variables as inputs .",
    "d0 includes channels in which one of the @xmath14 bosons in the @xmath35 process decays leptonically and the other decays hadronically .",
    "electron and muon final states are studied separately , each with 5.4 fb@xmath18 of data .",
    "random forests are used for the final discriminants .",
    "the d0 analysis of the @xmath36  jets final state has also been updated to include additional data ( 4.3 fb@xmath18 ) and both muonic and electronic tau decays .",
    "the output of boosted decision trees is used as the final discriminant .    for both cdf and d0 , events from qcd multijet ( instrumental ) backgrounds",
    "are measured in independent data samples using different methods . for cdf , backgrounds from sm processes with electroweak gauge bosons or top quarks",
    "were generated using pythia  @xcite , alpgen  @xcite , mc@nlo  @xcite , and herwig  @xcite programs .",
    "for d0 , these backgrounds were generated using pythia , alpgen , and comphep  @xcite , with pythia providing parton - showering and hadronization for all the generators .",
    "these background processes were normalized using either experimental data or next - to - leading order calculations ( including mcfm  @xcite for the @xmath37 heavy flavor process ) .    tables  [ tab : cdfacc ] and  [ tab : dzacc ] summarize , for cdf and d0 respectively , the integrated luminosities , the higgs boson mass ranges over which the searches are performed , and references to further details for each analysis ."
