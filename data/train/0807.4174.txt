    "identifying the first stage of galaxy formation is one of the ultimate goals in astronomy today .",
    "theoretical models predict that primordial gas accretes onto the center of halos via gravitational cooling with subsequent star - formation activity @xcite .",
    "these primordial galaxies make spatially extended ly@xmath0 nebulae caused by hydrogen cooling , and it is suggested that high-@xmath16 extended ly@xmath0 sources , or ly@xmath0 blobs , are candidates for primordial galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "ly@xmath0 blobs are found mostly at @xmath17 , and have angular extents of @xmath18 arcsec with total ly@xmath0 luminosities ranging from @xmath19 to @xmath20 erg s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the most prominent ly@xmath0 nebulae known to date are blobs 1 and 2 found by @xcite , which extend over @xmath21 kpc with @xmath22 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "although ly@xmath0 blobs are candidates for galaxies with gas inflow of cooling accretion , it is also suggested that ly@xmath0 blobs can be produced by intensive starbursts associated with significant outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) , by a hidden agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or by both of them ( e.g. , @xcite ; yang et al . in preparation ) .",
    "in fact , the infrared - submm and x - ray observations indicate that @xcite s blobs 1 and 2 would be powered by a heavily obscured starburst ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) and an agn @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xcite claim that all of their spectroscopically - identified ly@xmath0 blobs are likely to be the sites of massive galaxy formation because of their large line widths of @xmath23 km s@xmath5 .",
    "it is also well known that such bright large ly@xmath0 nebulae are associated with radio - loud agn ( e.g. @xcite ) or radio - quiet quasars ( @xcite ) . in this way , extended ly@xmath0 nebulae shed light not only on primordial galaxies but also on massive - galaxy formation and agn activity .",
    "so far , extended ly@xmath0 nebulae have been found only at @xmath24 with the majority at @xmath17 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . due to this current observational limit , it is difficult to identify primordial galaxies as well as to study the early stage of massive galaxy formation . at @xmath17 , the mean",
    "metallicity of the inter - stellar medium is already as high as @xmath25 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is predicted that the fraction of primordial galaxies to metal enriched galaxies would be quite low at @xmath17 ( @xcite ) , and that the fraction of population iii to population ii star - formation rate ( sfr ) rises with increasing redshift @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the importance of the early stage of massive - galaxy formation has been recognized by the downsizing behavior of stellar - mass assembly @xcite .",
    "a massive population at @xmath26 selected from a distant - red galaxy sample is old , @xmath27 gyr , and their mean formation redshift is estimated to be @xmath28 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is implied that galaxies at the massive end would have a very high specific star - formation rate ( ssfr ) at @xmath29 @xcite , and that a major active star - formation in massive galaxies probably takes place at @xmath29 .",
    "thus , it is important to study extended ly@xmath0 nebulae at a redshift greater than the current - observational limit , especially at the reionization epoch of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "this epoch is also the today s observational limit of galaxy studies @xcite .",
    "moreover , such bright ly@xmath0 sources can be a good laboratory for understanding reionization ( e.g. @xcite ) and metal enrichment ( e.g. @xcite ) of inter - galactic medium ( igm ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we report our discovery of an extended ly@xmath0 nebula , which we named himiko , near the reionization epoch at @xmath1 .",

    "the sky distribution of our laes show a rectangular area ( @xmath57 ) with a number density of laes higher than the average by a factor of 2 . in this high - density region , we find the object , himiko , that has the brightest @xmath33 magnitude and the largest isophotal area among the 207 lae candidates .",

    "we confirm that the brightest source from the previous 0.2 deg@xmath2 subaru deep field ( sdf ) survey for @xmath72 laes is only as bright as our second brightest candidate with no significant spatial extent @xcite , and that our object is distinguished from all the other @xmath72 laes found in the previous studies . by the comparisons with @xmath73 laes found in previous studies ,",

    "it indicates that it is unlikely that they are gravitationally lensed objects .",

    "if we consider the smaller radius for the @xmath321 estimate ( @xmath324 kpc ) than that for the @xmath322 estimate ( @xmath325 kpc ) , the difference of these dynamical masses defined in a common radius becomes even larger .",
    "if ly@xmath0 reflects dynamics , our giant lae would be a system more dominated by random motion than rotation .",

    "if this giant lae is an outflow object whose ly@xmath0 emission is produced by shock heating ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the dynamical time scale required to form the extended ly@xmath0 nebula is @xmath326 yr , where we assume the size of the major axis ( @xmath327 kpc ) and the typical velocity width ( @xmath328 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "since this time scale is as long as the cosmic time between @xmath1 and @xmath329 , it would start making an ionized - bubble since @xmath330 in this shock heating scenario .",
    "the nature of the ly@xmath0 nebula of our object is not yet clearly understood within the currently available observational data .",
    "there are five possible explanations : ( 1 ) halo gas photoionized by a hidden agn , ( 2 ) clouds of hii regions in a single virialized galaxy , ( 3 ) cooling gas accreting onto a massive dark halo associated with an initial onset of starburst at the halo center , ( 4 ) merging bright laes with clouds of hii regions , and ( 5 ) outflowing gas excited by shocks or uv radiation from starbursts and/or mergers .",
    "there is a chance of ( 1 ) , although no positive evidence of an agn is found .",
    "our object shows the lack of nv line , no line broadening , and no detections in x - ray , mir , submm , and radio bands ( figure [ fig : z7blob_multibandsed ] ) .",
    "but , these constraints are not strong enough to discard the possibility of a hidden agn .",
    "the case of ( 2 ) seems surprising , because it means that such a large galaxy exists in a very early epoch of @xmath3 .",
    "this galaxy would have a size of @xmath9 kpc and possibly two large star - forming regions in a disk seen in our @xmath61 band image (  [ sec : gravitational_lensing ] ) . however , there is a chance to explain this large galaxy in the framework of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models .",
    "we estimate properties of the most massive dark halo whose number density is the same as our object at @xmath3 . based on the analytic cdm model of @xcite , we find that the dark halo has a radius of 47 kpc and a mass of @xmath331 with a circular velocity of 380 km s@xmath5 .",
    "all of these values of the dark halo are significantly larger than those of our giant lae measured via radiation , indicating that the single - galaxy picture can be compatible with the cdm model in terms of halo properties .",

    "the case of ( 3 ) is possible with the potentially large @xmath168 of @xmath332 .",

    "this possible red peak may be similar to the one produced by igm infalling into a collapsing cloud , which is claimed by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the comparable sfr values from ly@xmath0 and uv continuum (  [ sec : stellar_population ] ) may not prefer this scenario , since the ly@xmath0 luminosity could be explained solely by normal star - forming activities that the uv continuum indicates .",
    "however , this argument is not strong due to the underestimation of sfr from ly@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "in fact , the intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity could be brighter by a factor of 20 if our giant lae has diffuse ly@xmath0 components similar to @xcite s blob 1 (  [ sec : comparisons ] ) .",
    "the explanation of ( 4 ) would be reasonable , given the possible existence of two peaks in @xmath61 band with a separation of @xmath210 ( 6.0 kpc ) .",
    "the @xmath33-image profile can be reproduced by two exponential disks with a reasonably small half - light radius of @xmath209 corresponding to @xmath336 kpc (  [ sec : gravitational_lensing ] ; cf .",
    "the merger would induce star - formation activities , and could produce the bright ly@xmath0-line and uv - continuum emission .",
    "figure [ fig : z7blob_specdiff ] shows that velocity widths at @xmath212 1 and 2 are similar , implying that dynamical masses of these components would be comparable .",

    "if the ly@xmath0 nebula really extends beyond the @xmath48-level isophotal area , it becomes difficult to explain the ly@xmath0 morphology with a profile of two merging laes .",
    "the ( 5 ) case seems plausible , since our object has a relatively high sfr and a large stellar - mass with possible multiple components in @xmath61 band (  [ sec : gravitational_lensing ] ) . in either case of ( 4 ) or ( 5 )",
    ", our object would be a massive galaxy in formation with significant star - formation contributing to cosmic reionization ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and/or with outflows for the metal enrichment of igm @xcite .",
    "since our object has the small velocity offset ( @xmath338 km s@xmath5 ) and the line width ( @xmath328 km s@xmath5 ) , the dynamics of merger or outflow would have to be well collimated to the direction perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the angular size of the ly@xmath0 nebula is @xmath9 proper kpc (  [ sec : gravitational_lensing ] ) , which is comparable to the diameter of the stellar disk of the present - day milky way .",
    "it is impressive , if we consider that the age of the universe at @xmath1 is only 6% of the one of the present - day universe .",
    "moreover , such an extended ly@xmath0 source is very rare in the cosmological volume only with the number density of @xmath165 comoving mpc@xmath166 at @xmath3 (  [ sec : spectroscopic_confirmation ] ) .",
    "if our selection of large ly@xmath0 nebula does not miss a significant fraction of massive galaxies at this early epoch ( @xmath3 ) , our object could be an ancestor of a bright - cluster or cd galaxy , and should be a good laboratory of massive - galaxy formation near the reionization epoch .      in section 4.3 , we have found that the currently available data do not provide a clear answer to the question about the nature of this object .",
    "it is obvious that deeper nir and infrared images of this object can be taken with hubble and spitzer space telescopes to constrain sfr , dust extinction , and stellar age , which will trace back through the star - formation history of this object ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these deep images are critically important to give stronger constraints on the sed of our object ( figure [ fig : z7blob_sed ] ) that characterizes sfr and dust extinction , and to identify ly@xmath0 photons that are not originated from star - formation activities but from others , such as cold accretion .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a giant ly@xmath0 emitter ( lae ) with a spitzer / irac counterpart near the reionization epoch at @xmath1 . the giant lae is found from the extensive 1 deg@xmath2 subaru narrow - band survey for @xmath3 laes in the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ) field , and subsequently identified by deep spectroscopy of keck / deimos and magellan / imacs . among our 207 lae candidates , </S>",
    "<S> this lae is not only the brightest narrow - band object with @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 in our survey volume of @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 , but also a spatially extended ly@xmath0 nebula with the largest isophotal area whose major axis is at least @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this object is more likely to be a large ly@xmath0 nebula with a size of @xmath9-kpc than to be a strongly - lensed galaxy by a foreground object . </S>",
    "<S> our keck spectrum with medium - high spectral and spatial resolutions suggests that the velocity width is @xmath10 km s@xmath5 , and that the line - center velocity changes by @xmath11 km s@xmath5 in a @xmath12-kpc range . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar mass and star - formation rate are estimated to be @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15yr@xmath5 , respectively , from the combination of deep optical to infrared images of subaru , ukidss - ultra deep survey , and spitzer / irac . </S>",
    "<S> although the nature of this object is not yet clearly understood , this could be an important object for studying cooling clouds accreting onto a massive halo , or forming - massive galaxies with significant outflows contributing to cosmic reionization and metal enrichment of inter - galactic medium . </S>"
