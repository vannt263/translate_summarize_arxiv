    "few  body nuclei with a number of nucleons a between 5 and 16 are a particularly interesting testground for nuclear theory . they lie in the range between the classical few  nucleon systems ( @xmath3 ) and the smallest nuclei , which can be described realistically starting from a mean field ansatz .",
    "therefore one hopes that these nuclei could build a link between few  body and many  body physics .",
    "presently quite an effort is made for a better understanding of these intermediate systems .",
    "specific interest is devoted to halo ",
    "nuclei , but also the less exotic nuclei of this mass range are investigated thoroughly .",
    "many theoretical techniques for the calculation of their ground states have been imported from the classical few  body field , where there has been a considerable progress in the last years .",
    "in fact for the classical few  body systems rather different approaches have been developed and proven to lead to precise results .",
    "these methods include solutions of the faddeev  yakubovsky equation , variational ( vmc ) and green function monte carlo ( gfmc ) , the hyperspherical harmonic ( hh ) ansatz , the stochastic variational ( svm ) , as well as coupled cluster and resonating group methods .    for nuclei with @xmath2 a similar level of precision",
    "has not yet been reached . here",
    "gfmc has led to the most accurate results .",
    "exact bound state energies with realistic @xmath4 interactions have been calculated for @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately wave functions can not be generated with this method .",
    "recently , a very powerful tool to calculate few  body wave functions has been developed with the svm ansatz  .",
    "however , this approach is probably most suitable for systems with @xmath6 . for nuclei with @xmath7",
    "rather good results have been obtained in the integro  differential equation approach ( idea )  @xcite , which uses the hh expansion at first order , and with a variational method , the translational invariant configuration interaction method ( tici )  , which is inspired by the coupled cluster method .    in this work we present the general formulation of the method , which combining the main ideas of the hh expansion , the pair correlation ansatz and the faddeev approach allows to calculate wave functions of few  body systems .",
    "we apply it to calculate the binding energies of nuclear systems with 6 , 8 and 12 particles . including higher order hh functions we make the nontrivial step beyond the idea approach .",
    "the difficulty in constructing antisymmetric @xmath0particle hh is overcome by the use of a recently developed very efficient recursive method  @xcite , where hh basis functions are constructed , belonging to well defined irreducible representations of the orthogonal and symmetric groups .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the method is described in section [ gen ] , while the construction of the hh basis function is briefly reviewed in section [ basis ] .",
    "section [ matrix ] illustrates how the matrix elements are calculated and the obtained results for the binding energies of nuclei with @xmath8 and 12 are discussed in section [ results ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ concl ] .",
    "our aim is the solution of the schrdinger equation for a system of a particles interacting via a two  body potential .",
    "after subtraction of the center of mass hamiltonian the problem reduces to the solution of the internal hamiltonian in terms of @xmath9 jacobi coordinates @xmath10 .",
    "one can write the wave function in terms of an hh expansion @xmath11 where , in case of nucleons , @xmath12 represent the hyperspherical harmonic functions coupled to the spin ",
    "isospin basis functions to yield the totally antisymmetric wave function .",

    "the label @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is needed to remove the degeneracy of the hyperspherical ( spin  isospin ) states with a given symmetry .",

    "we shall use the subscript @xmath14 to denote @xmath0 particle quantum numbers that depend on the jacobi coordinates , and the subscript @xmath35 for the @xmath35 particle subsystem .",
    "it is well known that finding a solution of the schrdinger equation in terms of the ansatz ( [ hh ] ) can be very difficult because the number of basis functions increases very fast with @xmath33 and in order to have a real convergence one must use a huge number of basis functions @xcite .",
    "therefore a correlation function is advantageous to give the wave function a proper behavior  @xcite .",
    "its advantages have been extensively verified for classical few - body systems reaching a high level of accuracy @xcite .",
    "a general ansatz within the two  body correlation scheme is the jastrow factor @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a two  body correlation function .",

    "these functions are expressed in terms of @xmath94 hyperspherical states , that are coupled , via the  tree \" method  @xcite , with the appropriate single ",
    "jacobi coordinate hyperspherical functions , into coupled @xmath0particle states with the desired angular momentum and hyperspherical angular momentum quantum numbers . actually , these coupled states yield an invariant subspace with respect to @xmath89 .",
    "the transposition class  sum of the symmetric group ( the second casimir operator ) is diagonalized within this subspace .",
    "the eigenvalues that are obtained after the diagonalization identify the irreps of the symmetric group uniquely , and the eigenvectors are the hyperspherical coefficients of fractional parentage ( hscfps ) .    constructing basis functions in such a recursive way makes the evaluation of any two body operator easy , since only the matrix element of the two  body operator between the last two particles needs to be calculated .",
    "a further improvement in the efficiency of the algorithm can be reached if one uses reversed order jacobi coordinates for the construction of the hyperspherical functions .",
    "normally jacobi coordinates are defined so that the first one is the relative distance between particles 1 and 2 , while the last is the distance between the ath particle and the center of mass of the a-1 particle system .",
    "this implies that in order to calculate the matrix element of a two  body operator , depending typically on the interparticle distance between the ath and ( a-1)th particles ( see section [ matrix ] ) , one needs to rotate the last two jacobi coordinates by a proper angle so that one of them represents the interparticle distance .",
    "this can be done by using the raynal revai , the t - coefficients and the 6-j coefficients . constructing the jacobi",
    "coordinates in reverse order , would simplify the calculation of two and three  body matrix elements as no further rotation is needed @xcite .",
    "recently an alternative way to construct the symmetrized hyperspherical functions has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this method consists in introducing as an intermediate subgroup the orthogonal group of kinematic rotations @xmath95 , i.e. one uses the group chain @xmath96 .",
    "the introduction of the kinematic group turns out to be of particular importance for increasing number of particles and for large values of @xmath33 as it results in a significant reduction in the number of hscfps and in the computation time .",
    "another benefit in using this method is the realization of kinematic rotations through the representation matrices of the group @xmath95 thus avoiding the use of the raynal  revai and the t ",
    "coefficients in calculating matrix elements of two  body operators depending on the interparticle distance . in the present calculation",
    "we have adopted this procedure , even if it is less efficient than defining jacobi coordinates in reversed order .",
    "the reason is that in this way one can easily extend the present method to solve the schrdinger  like equation with source , necessary for the calculation of the lorentz integral transforms of response functions  @xcite .",

    "( [ defme ] ) we see that @xmath159 this matrix element can be easily calculated once we know the action of @xmath67 on @xmath48 . since @xmath67 is invariant under kinematical rotations we can always write it using a set of jacobi coordinates such that @xmath160 , which leads to the following expression @xmath161 this is just the matrix element of a sum of two body operators which can be calculated as explained above .",
    "a bit more problematic are the three and four  body integrals @xmath162}_{k'\\nu'\\,p'\\ , k \\nu\\,p}$ ] and @xmath81}_{k'\\nu'\\,p ' k\\nu\\,p}$ ] . in order to calculate the three ( four ) body term",
    "we must first use three ( four ) generations of the ocfps in order to express the matrix elements in terms of the orthogonal symmetry adapted hyperspherical functions .",
    "then we can use the proper rotations and reduce the integrals to six  dimensional integrals that depend only on the last two jacobi coordinates .",
    "the explicit dependence of the hh functions on the jacobi coordinates is then revealed using the last two generations of the ohscfps , eq .",
    "( [ cfpon ] ) . for @xmath163 states",
    ", these integrals can further be reduced to three  dimensional integrations .",
    "the present method becomes more and more complex as the number of fermions increases .",
    "therefore in this work we consider only central @xmath4 potentials .",
    "we present results for 6 , 8 and 12 nucleons interacting via the volkov  @xcite ( vv ) , the afnan ",
    "tang  @xcite ( s3 ) , the modified s3 potential  @xcite ( ms3 ) , the brink  boeker  @xcite ( b1 ) and the malfliet  tjon  @xcite potentials ( mt  i / iii and mt ",
    "the accuracy and convergence of the method have been investigated for 6 and 8 nucleons .",
    "the first step in our numerical study was to determine the hyperradial working point , i.e. the parameters @xmath164 and @xmath165 of the laguerre polynomials in eq .",
    "( [ frho ] ) , the number of radial grid points and their location . after some preliminary tests we decided to use 15 hyperradial grid points and 15 hyperradial functions with the parameters @xmath166 fm and @xmath167 .",
    "the grid points where chosen as the abscissas for a gauss ",
    "laguerre integration .",
    "the next step in setting our working point was to check the convergence of the two  body correlation terms .",
    "as an example we studied the @xmath168be system with the hard core mt  v potential , using a single hh function , with @xmath169 and expanding the correlation function into jacobi polynomials . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] the binding energy converges very fast with increasing number @xmath170 of polynomials .",
    "in fact , the energy difference between the calculations with 7 and 8 correlations terms is about 0.02 mev . as a consequence we used 8 terms in the expansion of the correlation function .",
    "the effect of introducing the hypercentral potential @xmath42 is presented in table [ tb : vhc ] for @xmath171li with the vv potential . as can be seen",
    "the hypercentral potential accelerates the convergence of the hh expansion . with the lowest @xmath172 of",
    "2 one already obtains a larger binding energy than with @xmath173 without hypercentral potential .",
    "thus the introduction of @xmath174 is certainly advantageous .",
    "our numerical results with the parameters described above are presented in table [ tb : n6 ] for the @xmath175 nucleon system and in table [ tb : n8 ] for the @xmath176 nucleon system .",
    "for @xmath171li the calculations include only one line irreps of the kinematical group @xmath177 and the irreps [ 42 ] and [ 33 ] of the permutation group .",
    "we compare our values with recent accurate variational results  @xcite available for some of these central potentials .",
    "one can notice that with the vv potential one reaches convergence faster than with other potentials .",
    "the result for the binding energy starts oscillating around the asymptotic value .",
    "it also compares nicely to the variational result of ref .",
    "the other potentials show a tendency to convergence even if @xmath172 is not large enough to reach it .",
    "the mt potentials seem to lead to a more rapid convergence than s3 and b1 . the differences may be due both to the fact that the convergent value has not yet been reached and to the missing irreps of the permutation group .",
    "the two line irreps of the orthogonal group are of little importance .",
    "this has been checked for the 8 particle case , where they give rather small contributions .",
    "the calculations for @xmath168be include only the irrep ( 400 ) of the kinematical group @xmath178 and irreps with at most 3 rows of the permutation group . here",
    "the comparison is made with the tici results  @xcite . in all cases",
    "our results for the binding energy are somewhat larger .",
    "they show characteristics similar to the six  body case .",
    "again one sees that the vv potential result presents small oscillations around the convergent value and that the rather hard core mt potentials seem to give values closer to convergence than b1 or s3 . from the comparison between the tici results with and without state dependent correlations",
    "one can infer that for the mt potentials state independent correlations already give rather satisfying results , while state dependent correlations are more effective for b1 and s3 .",
    "since our correlations are state independent one could expect such a different convergence behavior as found in table [ tb : n8 ]    the results for @xmath179c are presented in table [ tb : n12 ] . here",
    "the calculations include a single hh state , @xmath180 , with the kinematical group @xmath181 irrep @xmath182 and the @xmath183 irrep @xmath184 $ ] .",
    "the comparison is made with tici",
    "@xcite , idea  @xcite , and the variational result of ref .",
    "again from the comparison with the tici results one can see that s3 and b1 results are farer from convergence than the mt values and that state dependent correlations play a similar role as discussed for the @xmath168be case .",
    "the idea results for 12 particles deviate somewhat from ours , although they are all obtained using a single hh state .",
    "one possible explanation of the difference can be attributed to the choice of the hh state which is not unique . on the other hand",
    "we have obtained excellent agreement with the idea results for 16 bosons .",
    "in this work we have formulated a general method to calculate the wave functions of light systems up to considerably large number of particle .",
    "this method combines the main ideas of the hh expansion , the pair correlation ansatz and the faddeev approach .",
    "the actual application of it is made possible by the use of a very efficient recursive algorithm to construct the antisymmetric a - particle state containing hyperspherical harmonics .",
    "we have applied the method to calculate the binding energies of 6 , 8 and 12 nucleon systems with central local potentials .",
    "the results we have obtained are very encouraging .",
    "for some potentials ( vv , 6 particles and mtv , 8 particles ) we have reached the convergence region with @xmath180 which is the maximum value allowed by our present computer facilities ( workstations ) . the @xmath171li result for the vv potential is slightly higher than the svm result . even if in other cases we have not yet reached the convergence in the hh expansion our results are close to the tici results .",
    "for the eight  body case they are higher for all the potentials where results were available for a comparison .",
    "the method presented here for the solution of the few  body schrdinger equation can be easily extended to solve the schrdinger  like equation with a source , necessary for the application of the lorentz integral transform method .",
