    "the primary goal of the heavy ion collisions at the highest energy of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the energy of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is to explore the properties of the extreme hot and dense matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , existed in the early stages of the collisions .",
    "recent investigations @xcite indicate that the initial systems created in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at the rhic and lhc energies are not uniform in space , and there are event - by - event fluctuations of the system initial quantities , due to the fluctuations of nucleon distributions in the nuclei , the fluctuations in the color charge distributions inside a nucleon , and combined with highly lorentz contraction .",
    "the studies of the system evolution with the fluctuating initial conditions ( fic ) and the influence of the fic on final particle observables are recently very interesting issues in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite .",

    "they reflect the transverse ( perpendicular to the beam direction ) anisotropic pressure property and the space - time structure of the particle - emitting sources , respectively . in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the spectators depart from the reaction region quickly after collision , and a very hot and dense fireball is created in the mid - rapidity region . for uniform systems of the fireballs",
    "the odd - order azimuthal flow harmonics are expected to be zero .",
    "however , recent studies indicate that the fluctuating inhomogeneous density distributions of the initial systems may lead to nonzero triangular flow , and thus inspires the investigations of azimuthal triangular flow and even higher - order flow harmonics . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors reproduced well the experimental flow results of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at the rhic and the lhc , by using the ip - glasma fic @xcite with the viscous hydrodynamic model of music @xcite .",
    "the investigations imply that the fluctuations in the initial geometry state are important and the created medium behaves as a nearly perfect liquid of nuclear matter because it has an extraordinarily low ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density .    on event - by - event basis ,",

    "we introduce a granularity length to describe the granular inhomogeneity of the initial sources and investigate its relationships with the fluctuations of the flow harmonics and hbt correlation functions .",
    "our investigations indicate that the fic lead to event - by - event fluctuations of the elliptic flow , triangular flow , and hbt correlation functions .",
    "these fic - caused fluctuations can be detected by the fluctuation distributions of the observables of event subcollections .",
