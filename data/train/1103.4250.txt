    "cosmogenic neutrinos , the daughter particles of the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) process in which the highest energy cosmic - rays interacting with the cosmic - microwave background @xcite , may give a unique picture of the universe in the highest energy regime .",
    "cosmogenic neutrinos carry information about the sources of the highest energy cosmic - rays , such as their location , cosmological evolution , and cosmic - ray spectra at the sources .",
    "various cosmogenic neutrino models  @xcite which assume primary cosmic - ray protons predict neutrino fluxes @xmath7  @xmath8 in the energy range @xmath9  gev @xmath10  gev , which implies that the @xmath11 solid angle averaged neutrino effective area divided by energy @xmath12 must be larger than @xmath13  m@xmath14/gev ( e.g.  @xmath15m@xmath14 at @xmath9  gev and @xmath16m@xmath14 at @xmath17  gev ) to detect several cosmogenic neutrinos every year .",
    "several techniques have been used to realize such huge detection volumes for these extremely - high energy ( ehe ) neutrinos .",
    "air - shower detectors search for neutrino induced young inclined showers  @xcite or earth - skimming events initiated by tau neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "radio cherenkov neutrino detectors search for radio askaryan pulses in a dielectric medium as the ehe neutrino signature  @xcite .",
    "underground neutrino telescopes , such as icecube , deployed in transparent naturally occurring media  @xcite can detect ehe neutrino interactions through the strong cherenkov radiation emitted by the charged secondary particles .",
    "this technique is well established for observations of astrophysical neutrinos in the mev to gev energy region  @xcite , and can also be utilized to search for cosmogenic ehe neutrinos with an appropriate background rejection method . in a neutrino telescope ,",
    "an ehe neutrino interaction would be identified by the extremely high number of cherenkov photons deposited in the detector .    in this paper , we describe the search for neutrinos with energies above @xmath0  gev using data collected with the half - completed icecube detector in 2008@xmath32009 .",
    "this analysis is sensitive to all three neutrino flavors .",
    "compared to the previous ehe neutrino search described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which used an earlier stage of the icecube detector , the current analysis benefits from the enlarged instrumented volume and from improved agreement between simulated and observed event distributions .",
    "this article presents the improved strategies implemented since the previous analysis  @xcite .",
    "the analysis uses data collected from april 6 , 2008 through may 20 , 2009 . at the time of data collection , the icecube detector consisted of 2400 digital optical modules ( doms ) on 40 vertical strings .",
    "the volume of the detector was roughly 0.5  km@xmath18 with the detector center located at a depth of 1948  m below the ice surface .",
    "the doms consist of a 25  cm photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) @xcite with data acquisition and calibration electronics , data compression , communications , and control hardware  @xcite .",
    "the trigger setting was unchanged from the previous analysis  @xcite .",
    "the analysis was optimized on simulated data with most of the experimental data kept blind .",
    "a 10% subset of the experimental data was used for examinations of the monte carlo simulations and detector response .",
    "this subset comprised 35.8 days of detector livetime distributed randomly throughout the data collection period , and was not used once the analysis was fully defined .",
    "the use of statistically independent final sample conservatively ensures avoidance of possible analysis bias due to tuning a monte carlo simulation using an experimental subset .",
    "the selection criteria were then applied to the complementary 90% of the experimental data , comprising 333.5 days of livetime .",
    "the primary background in this analysis is muon bundles made up of large numbers of muons produced by high energy cosmic - ray interactions in the atmosphere .",
    "this background was simulated with the corsika air - shower simulation package version 6.720  @xcite with the sibyll 2.1  @xcite and qgsjet - ii  @xcite hadronic interaction models , without prompt muons from the heavy meson decays .",
    "cosmic - ray interactions assuming pure proton and iron primary compositions in the energy region between @xmath0 and @xmath19  gev were simulated .",
    "background contributions from primary cosmic - ray energies beyond @xmath19  gev were estimated by extrapolation of the simulated sample up to the gzk cutoff energy of @xmath205 @xmath21  gev .",
    "ehe neutrino signal events in energies between @xmath22 and @xmath23  gev from several flux models  @xcite were simulated using the juliet package  @xcite .",
    "the amount of energy deposited in the form of cherenkov photons by the neutrino - induced charged particles in the detector is highly correlated with the energy of the particles  @xcite .",
    "an ehe neutrino interaction occurring inside or close to the icecube detector would stand out against the background of cosmic - ray induced muons due to the much higher light deposition .",
    "the total number of photo - electrons ( npe ) recorded in an event was used as the main distinctive feature to separate signal from background .",
    "the number of photo - electrons ( p.e . ) recorded by an individual dom was derived by integrating the pedestal subtracted waveforms .",
    "each dom has two waveform digitizers , that simultaneously capture p.e .",
    "signals with differing dynamic ranges and time windows  @xcite .",
    "the event total npe was then obtained by summing the number of p.e .  detected by each dom .",
    "pmt saturation effects and the sizes of the time windows limit the npe estimation at high light levels .",
    "the initial npe calculation was performed online at the south pole . for this analysis",
    "we consider only events with @xmath24  @xmath25  630 .",
    "the event rate of this `` on - line bright sample '' was @xmath201.4  hz . at this level ,",
    "the background rate exceeded the expected signal rate by @xmath26 .      for the following data selection step ,",
    "the npe values were re - calculated after eliminating photon signals from low energy muons accidentally coincident in a 20  @xmath27s time window of a large npe event .",
    "these low energy muons leave a faint light , typically with an npe  @xmath28  9 .",
    "the light deposition of the coinciding low energy muon was , in most cases , spatially and temporally separated from the main bright p.e .  cluster .",
    "while the few coincident photons have very small impact on the npe calculation , they can disturb the geometrical reconstruction of the particle tracks later on in the analysis .",
    "contributions from coincident low energy muons were eliminated by removing p.e .",
    "signals that were temporally separated from the time of the highest light deposition associated with the main high npe event .",
    "the recording time of a p.e .",
    "signal in the @xmath29 dom , @xmath30 , was defined as the time at which 10% of the total charge had been captured .",
    "the time of the highest light deposition was defined as the time @xmath31 of the dom which captured the largest p.e .",
    "signal in the event .",
    "this time , @xmath31 , was typically associated with the time of closest approach of the charged particle tracks to any dom in the detector .",
    "for the off - line npe calculation and track reconstruction , those p.e .",
    "signals which occurred outside the time window [ @xmath34.4  @xmath27s , 6.4  @xmath27s ] around the @xmath31 were excluded .",
    "the `` off - line bright sample '' selects events with npe @xmath32 and the number of hit doms ( ndom )  @xmath33 ; here and below npe and ndom are obtained after the @xmath34 time window cleaning .",
    "these npe and ndom thresholds reduced the background rate by two orders of magnitude while keeping @xmath2070  % of the cosmogenic neutrino - induced events remain .",
    "the remaining backgrounds are bundles containing many hundreds of muons , with an estimated cosmic - ray energy above @xmath35  gev .",
    "apart from npe , the particle direction and the depth distribution of the detected cherenkov photons are distinctive event features that separate the ehe neutrino signal from the atmospheric muon background . due to the energy dependence of the neutrino interaction cross section ,",
    "most of the ehe neutrino signal is expected from directions close to the horizon . as a result of the depth dependence of the optical properties of the polar ice ,",
    "the largest photon signals are often detected in the deepest part of the detector , where the ice is most transparent  @xcite . on the other hand , the background atmospheric muons enter the detection volume from above and lose a substantial fraction of their energy during propagation through the detector .",
    "therefore , the time and depth coordinates , z , of the detected cherenkov photons , measured relative to the detector center , show negative correlation for background .",
    "the largest photon signals from these background muons are expected at shallow depths near the top of the detector .",
    "exceptions are inclined atmospheric muon bundles that pass outside the instrumented volume with the point of closest approach in the deep , clear ice at the bottom of the detector , or individual muons that deposit most of their energy in an isolated catastrophic energy loss in the deep ice after having passed through the top part of the detector .",
    "track reconstructions often fail to identify such atmospheric muon events as downward - going tracks , when most of the light deposition occurs in the deep part of the detector .",
    "therefore , a track reconstruction is applied only to those events in which the dom with the largest signal is located at z @xmath36 @xmath3300  m",
    "(  shallow events \" ) .",
    "the negative z value indicates the vertical distance below the center of the icecube detector . for events with the largest photon signal at z @xmath28 @xmath3300  m",
    "(  deep events \" ) , further event selection criteria rely on timing instead of directional information .    for the shallow events ,",
    "the particle directions are reconstructed with the linefit algorithm  @xcite . since the majority of the ehe neutrino induced events",
    "is close to the horizon  @xcite while the directions of the background muon bundles are mostly vertical , it is important to minimize the number of background tracks that are misreconstructed as horizontal . in order to reject the mis - reconstructed background events , another simple one - dimensional reconstruction is introduced .",
    "the distribution of average depth of p.e .  as a function of timing are fitted by a linear function , @xmath37 .",
    "the fit parameter , @xmath38 , is a measure for the speed at which the light signal propagates in z - direction , and hence for the inclination of the tracks .",
    "for vertically downward - going relativistic particles , the quantity @xmath39 takes values @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the vacuum speed of light , whereas close to horizontal tracks yield values @xmath42 .",
    "the shallow `` quality bright sample '' requires an additional condition of @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the reconstructed zenith angle from the linefit .",
    "this condition excludes events for which the one - dimensional fit suggests a significantly more vertical downward - going geometry than the linefit .",
    "both signal and background are reduced by less than @xmath202% by this criterion .",
    "figure  [ fig : level2 ] shows the distributions of npe ( panel  ( a ) ) and cos  @xmath44 ( panel  ( b ) ) for experimental data , background and signal simulations in the quality bright sample .",
    "the distributions of corsika - sibyll with an iron primary composition show a reasonable agreement with experimental data while the total event rates are 50% overestimated by simulation .",
    "the zenith angle reconstruction resolution of the shallow quality bright sample is @xmath201.4@xmath45 rms for muon bundle background and @xmath462.5@xmath45 for @xmath47 signal .",
    "this is because the @xmath48 signal experiences more stochastic energy losses along with hadronic cascades at its interaction vertices .",
    "the deep bright events ( @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath3300  m ) are mostly events that traverse the bottom edge of icecube or are uncontained events that propagate or cascade below the detector .",
    "the inclination of these events tends to be reconstructed more horizontally than the true direction .",
    "the agreement between the simulation and experimental distributions improves with increasing npe threshold values for these events .",
    "events with npe @xmath51 are discarded from the deep quality bright sample in order to achieve a reasonable agreement between experimental data and simulations .",
    "since the majority of the ehe neutrino - induced events have npe @xmath52 , the effect on the signal efficiency by this requirement is minimal .",
    "a fraction of 96% of background is rejected by the cut , while 91% of signal is retained .",
    "the panel  ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : level2 ] shows the npe distributions from the deep quality bright sample .",
    "the final event selection is chosen in order to minimize the model discovery factor ( mdf = @xmath53 )  @xcite in the region of the phase space where a better signal to background ratio ( s / b ) is expected , where @xmath54 is the least number of events to claim signal discovery at 5@xmath55 significance and @xmath56 is the number of neutrinos expected from the gzk  1  @xcite model flux .",
    "for the shallow events , high s / b is obtained in the region near the horizontal reconstructed direction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : level2 ] ( b ) . for the deep events , instead of reconstructing the inclination of events ,",
    "we utilize the time interval , @xmath57 , between the earliest detected photon in an event and @xmath31 to obtain the best s / b subsample . the vertical atmospheric muon bundle events with the largest p.e .",
    "near the bottom of icecube are often associated with a small number of p.e .  in the shallow detector region",
    "much earlier than @xmath31 .",
    "this contrasts to the ehe neutrino signal events .",
    "the main contributions to a detectable ehe signal in icecube come from neutrino - induced horizontal muons and taus  @xcite .",
    "these produce the largest p.e .",
    "signals shortly after the first recorded photo - electrons . contained cascade - like events induced by neutrino interactions  @xcite inside the icecube detector volume also exhibit a similar trend .",
    "figure  [ fig : level2 ] ( d ) shows the distributions in the deep quality bright sample .",
    "the best s / b is achieved in the bin @xmath58  ns . the high rate in the experimental data for @xmath59  ns is due to random noise in the doms and remaining coincident muons that were underestimated by the simulations . the slightly higher rate for the data in the bin @xmath60  ns may reflect the fact that the ice is cleaner than what was simulated in the deep region .",
    "figure  [ fig:2d ] presents the event distributions in the planes of cos @xmath44 vs.  npe for the shallow events and @xmath61 vs.  npe for the deep events .",
    "optimization is performed by differentiating the npe threshold numbers in the region cos  @xmath44 @xmath50 0.3 or @xmath57 @xmath50 0.5  @xmath27s for shallow and deep quality bright sample respectively .",
    "the npe threshold of the other region ( cos  @xmath44 @xmath25 0.3 or @xmath57 @xmath25 0.5  @xmath27s ) is conservatively determined such that the number of background events above the threshold is less than @xmath62 of the full livetime for each bin of cos  @xmath44 with width 0.2 or 1  @xmath27s for @xmath63 .",
    "this improves the detection sensitivity without sacrificing discovery potential .",

    "events with npe above the threshold value in each bin are considered to be signal event candidates .",

    "this uncertainties are included in the final limit using a method outlined in @xcite .",
    "this estimation together with the null result in the experimental sample gives the feldman - cousins 90% cl event upper limit  @xcite of 2.35 events .",
    "for cosmic neutrinos with an @xmath1 energy spectrum , this implies an integral flux limit of @xmath5  @xmath6 with the central 90% of the @xmath1 signal found in the energy interval @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4  gev .",
    "this result is the first constraint of neutrino fluxes below the waxman - bahcall flux bound  @xcite in this energy region .",
    "we analyzed the 2008 - 09 data sample collected by the 40-string icecube detector to search for extremely - high energy neutrinos with energies exceeding @xmath0  gev .",
    "the differential and integral limits obtained are significantly improved relative to our previous result  @xcite .",
    "this is due to both the increased instrumented volume and improvements of the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the improved agreement between experimental and simulated data allowed a loosening of the npe threshold in the data selection , thereby lowering the energy threshold of the analysis and improving the selection efficiency for high energy signal events that occurred outside the instrumented volume .",
    "this can also be seen in the corresponding neutrino effective area at the final selection shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : effarea ] . compared to the previous search  @xcite ,",
    "the effective area is a factor of 6 and 3.3 increased at @xmath66  gev and @xmath17  gev , respectively .",
    "the full solid angle averaged 3 flavor ( assuming @xmath67:@xmath47:@xmath68=1:1:1 ) neutrino effective area reaches 300  m@xmath14 at @xmath9  gev and 2100  m@xmath14 at @xmath17  gev .",
    "the 90% cl differential limit at @xmath17  gev is a factor of @xmath204 higher than the fluxes predicted by the models gzk  2 and 5 , and a factor of @xmath208 higher than the flux predicted by the models gzk  1 , 4 , 6 , all of which assume primary protons .",
    "this suggests that the icecube ehe neutrino search will reach these flux levels in the near future since the event rate is roughly proportional to the fiducial volume ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] ) , and the current analysis used only the half - instrumented icecube detector configuration .",
    "further improvements in sensitivity would enable icecube to act as a a probe of the primary cosmic - ray composition at gzk energies  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : effarea ] indicates that a large part of the ehe neutrino signal are expected from the zenith angle region between @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "upward - going ehe neutrinos are absorbed in the earth .",
    "the propagation length of secondary muons and taus is greater than the distance between the surface and the icecube fiducial volume .",
    "thus , the inclined particles that reach the icecube detector are created in the earth . for @xmath67 ,",
    "the event signatures are produced nearly at the neutrino interaction points and the current analysis is sensitive to all downward - going geometries .",

    "significant contributions from all neutrino flavors are observed . in the gzk  6 model , 13% of the signal are from @xmath67 , 45% are from @xmath47 and 42% are from @xmath73 .",
    "through - going tracks ( muons and taus ) constitute 60% of the signal rate and the rest are neutrino interactions that create cascade - like events near and inside the detector volume .",
