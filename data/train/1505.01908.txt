    "manipulation of magnetization and spin current without magnetic field is a key issue in spintronics technology . in the case of metallic ferromagnets , electric current has been proved to be highly useful for switching the magnetization and for driving magnetic domain walls by use of current - induced spin - transfer torques proposed by berger @xcite and slonczewski @xcite .",
    "metallic systems have been studied extensively also for spin current manipulation such as for direct and inverse spin hall effects @xcite . besides metallic magnets , insulating ferrimagnet such as yttrium iron garnet ( yig )",
    "are also expected to be useful spintronics materials @xcite because of its weak spin relaxation effects as represented by small gilbert damping parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "although use of electric current do not apply to insulators , recent extensive studies revealed that manipulation of magnetization of yig is possible by several different methods , such as using a temperature gradient @xcite and sound waves@xcite .",
    "thermal methods are of particular importance for realizing novel thermoelectric materials based on magnetic materials @xcite , which are expected to be useful for devices with low energy consumption .",
    "recently , thermally - driven domain wall motion in a yig film was observed optically @xcite .",
    "the domain wall was found to move to a hotter side of the system , and the speed was about @xmath1 m / s when a temperature gradient of @xmath2 k / mm is applied .",
    "the direction of the motion is counter - intuitive , but is consistent with the spin - transfer effect of spin waves ( magnons ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , magnons excited around the wall are pushed by the temperature gradient to the colder side , and they transfer an spin angular momentum opposite to the local magnetization , resulting in a domain wall motion towards the hotter end .",
    "thermodynamic viewpoint of domain wall motion was discussed by wang @xcite by evaluating numerically the entropy and free energy due to the magnons around the wall .",
    "it was concluded that the wall motion to the hotter side is consistent with minimization of free energy when the entropy due to magnons are taken into account . in a metallic ferromagnet , thermal motion of domain walls",
    "was observed in 1986 @xcite .",
    "the motion was towards the colder end , and the wall - entropy force proportional to @xmath3 was suggested as a possible mechanism @xcite , but the behavior would be explained simply by the spin - transfer torque induced by thermally - driven conduction electrons .",
    "domain wall under temperature gradient was numerically studied by solving the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation for spins in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effect of temperature was modeled as a random magnetic field satisfying the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the results indicated that the behavior of the wall are essentially the same as the electric - current - driven case @xcite .",
    "for instance , a sliding motion with a constant tilting angle occurs at low driving force or at large damping cases , while the tilting angle becomes time - dependent resulting in a screw - like motion when the driving force exceeds a threshold value corresponding to the walker s break down field .",
    "the llg approach was employed also to study the motion of magnetic skyrmions @xcite .",
    "skyrmions also turned out to move to the hotter region in the same manner as domain walls and the velocity was found to be inversely proportional to the gilbert damping parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical result was explained by the `` brownian motion '' of the skyrmion driven by thermal random magnetic field and the spin - transfer effect from thermal spin waves . it was demonstrated that the spin wave spin - transfer effect contributing to the motion towards the hotter side is proportional to @xmath4 , while the velocity due to the brownian motion , which pushes the skyrmions to the colder side , proportional to @xmath5 , and thus is negligibly small when @xmath0 is small .",
    "the study of ref .",
    "@xcite was extended to include dissipative torque arising from spin relaxation in refs .",
    "most of the theories on thermally - driven magnetic systems so far are either phenomenological @xcite or numerical @xcite and lack microscopic viewpoint .",
    "the reason is obvious ; the temperature gradient appears not to be straightforwardly integrated into a linear response theory or field - theoretical methods since its effect is not described by a microscopic interaction hamiltonian .",
    "this difficulty was removed in the case of electron transport phenomena by luttinger already in 1964 @xcite .",
    "he introduced a fictitious scalar field called a gravitational  potential , @xmath6 , which couples to the local energy density , @xmath7 , by an interaction hamiltonian @xmath8 it was argued that @xmath6 satisfies @xmath9 and that a linear response theory ( kubo formula ) applies to the thermally - driven case by considering the correlation functions of the energy current density .",
    "many works have been carried out based on the gravitational  potential formalism on electron transport @xcite , quantum dot @xcite , magnon transport @xcite and thermal torques @xcite . at the same time , it has been noted that naive application of kubo formula may result in wrong thermal coefficients @xcite .    as alternative approaches for thermal transport ,",
    "landauer - like approach by connecting locally equilibrium systems at different temperatures is possible @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the obtained transport coefficients have no unphysical divergence , since only the electrons at the fermi energy contribute to them .",
    "quantum kinetic equation approach was employed in refs .",
    "@xcite to study electron correlation effects . still , a fully quantum mechanical description based on a linear response theory has wider applications and is highly useful .",
    "prescriptions to extract correct results based on the gravitational   potential formalism were given by some works @xcite .",
    "in the case of thermally - induced electron transport , smrcka and streda carried out the calculation of thermal hall effect in the presence of an applied magnetic field , based on the luttinger s prescription @xcite . they rewrote the luttinger s interaction , @xmath10 , by use of integral by parts as @xmath11 and carried out a perturbative expansion with respect to a physical force proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "the analysis , however , is based on a interaction proportional to a unbounded operator , @xmath13 , and thus the results may not be always convincing .",
    "recent works on thermal magnons are based on the same treatment @xcite .",
    "later , qin et .",
    "al . pointed out that a naive application of luttinger s approach for thermal hall effect leads to a unphysical divergence at @xmath14 , and that this divergence arises from an equilibrium rotational electron current induced when the time - reversal invariance is broken by the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "they showed that the correct non - equilibrium response is obtained if one subtract the equilibrium current before applying the gravitational   potential .",
    "the case of thermally - induced torque in ferromagnetic metals was studied in detail by kohno et .",
    "they calculated the non - equilibrium torque on the magnetization generated by the conduction electron when a temperature gradient is applied and found that unphysical divergence arises if luttinger s approach is straightforwardly applied .",
    "they demonstrated that the divergence arises from the equilibrium torque describing the exchange interaction between the magnetization and that this equilibrium contribution needs to be removed when discussing non - equilibrium torque .",
    "it was recently pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that those problems of luttinger s formalism arise from the fact that the gravitational   potential couples to the total energy density , modifying the equilibrium properties in addition to inducing non - equilibrium response .",
    "it was discussed that the role of diamagnetic current , which is essential for removing unphysical equilibrium ( non - dissipative ) contribution from transport coefficients @xcite , is not seen straightforwardly in the scalar potential formalism . instead of a scalar potential formalism , a vector potential formalism to describe thermally - induced transport was developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , shitade demonstrated using the analogy of general relativity that if an invariance under time translation is imposed locally , a vector potential arises from luttinger s scalar potential and they are described by a gauge invariant theory .",
    "he applied his model to describe thermal hall effect of non - interacting electrons and showed that the results satisfy the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "the origin of the invariance under local time translation was not argued . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the vector potential was introduced by rewriting the luttinger s",
    "hamiltonian for the gravitational   potential using the conservation law of the energy in the limit of static ( dc ) limit of the temperature gradient .",
    "the vector potential interaction was also argued there in the context of entropy force . since the thermal vector potential couples to energy current",
    ", it only generate excitations and does not alter equilibrium contributions .",
    "the vector potential representation thus guarantees a straightforward linear response calculations for thermal dynamics on the equal footing as the electric field - driven case .",
    "it was indeed shown that unphysical equilibrium contributions are canceled automatically by diamagnetic   currents associated with the vector potential .",
