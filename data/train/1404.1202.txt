    "as inferred from astrochemical studies for galactic sources , chemical compositions often tell us much more about physical conditions of target sources than conventional physical parameters such as mass , density , and temperature . for example , dynamical evolution of starless cores has been studied on the basis of chemical indicators such as the ccs / nh@xmath2 ratio and the deuterium fractionation ratio ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". this direction will be more and more important in extragalactic studies in the near future .",
    "however , efforts interpreting chemical compositions in terms of physical conditions are still in their infancy for external galaxies .",
    "their chemical compositions have often been discussed on the basis of astrochemical concepts established in nearby molecular clouds in our galaxy without careful considerations on a large difference of a resolvable scale between galactic molecular clouds and external galaxies . for external galaxies ,",
    "we usually observe the ` average ' chemical compositions of a number of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "although this situation is being improved by high angular resolution observations with interferometers , there still remains a large gap between extragalactic chemistry and molecular - cloud chemistry .",
    "therefore , it is of fundamental importance to understand the chemical composition averaged over gmcs and its meanings .",
    "this can not be done with models , but has to be done with observations .",
    "chemical compositions of external galaxies are mainly studied in the nuclear regions .",
    "they are known to vary under extreme environments such as the starbursts and the agns .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that the abundance ratio of hcn and hco@xmath3 depends on relative contribution of photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) and x - ray dominated regions ( xdrs ) ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "unbiased spectral line surveys in a wide frequency range became realistic for external galaxies , thanks to recent technical developments of sensitive receivers and wide - band correlators .",
    "many spectral line surveys have been conducted toward the nuclear regions of nearby galaxies with single dish telescopes ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and even with an interferometer ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "in order to extract chemical features associated with the extreme environments of the nuclear regions , it is indispensable to know the chemical composition averaged over the similar size including a number of gmcs in a spiral arm as a reference .",
    "however , only little efforts have been done for such a fundamental task .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied distributions of cch , c@xmath4s , n@xmath0h@xmath1 , ch@xmath2oh , hnco , hnc , hc@xmath2n , and so in ic  342 and maffei  2 with the ovro and bima mm - interferometers .",
    "they observed a part of the spiral arm region as well as the nuclear region , and revealed that the distributions are different from molecule to molecule .",
    "despite such an effort , we still need to explore the meaning of the chemical composition averaged over the 1-kpc scale region involving many gmcs in a spiral arm , which would have a characteristic chemical composition as a whole .",
    "if we can understand its meanings in relation to physical conditions and internal structures , it could be used as a standard reference for chemical diagnostics of external galaxies . as the first step toward this goal",
    ", we have conducted an unbiased spectral line survey toward a spiral arm in m51 to characterize the averaged chemical composition of gmcs there .",
    "m51 ( ngc  5194 ) is a nearby grand - design spiral galaxy ( sabc ) with a distance of 8.4  mpc @xcite . molecular gas distribution and kinematics of this galaxy have extensively been studied with co emission @xcite .",
    "in addition , hcn @xcite , hco@xmath3 @xcite , hnc @xcite , cs @xcite , n@xmath0h@xmath1 @xcite , and nh@xmath2 @xcite have been detected toward the nuclear region .",
    "in spiral arm regions , @xcite observed the @xmath5co , @xmath6co , c@xmath7o , hco@xmath1 , and hcn lines .",
    "they have estimated kinetic temperature and h@xmath0 density by lvg analysis , and suggested that star formation activities do not have a strong impact on physical conditions of molecular gas probed at their observational resolution of 120  pc .",
    "however , the observation is limited to a few representative molecular species . in this study , we have investigated the chemical composition of gmcs averaged over the 1-kpc scale region toward two positions in a spiral arm with different star formation activities by the spectral line survey .",
    "observations were performed with the iram  30  m telescope at pico veleta in 2329 , december , 2011 and 1013 , august , 2012 .",
    "the observed positions were ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) = ( 13@xmath1029@xmath1150@xmath12.0 , + 47@xmath1311@xmath1425@xmath15.0 ) ( p1 ) and ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) = ( 13@xmath1029@xmath1150@xmath12.9 , + 47@xmath1311@xmath1406@xmath15.9 ) ( p2 ) ( figure [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "these are the @xmath6co(@xmath16 ) peak positions of the spiral arm in m51 @xcite .",
    "p1 contains many of the balmer  @xmath17 and paschen  @xmath17 spots and shows strong 24 micron emission , while these emissions are generally weaker in p2 than in p1 @xcite .",
    "therefore , star formation activity is higher in p1 than in p2 .",
    "the beam size is 3020@xmath15 and 1917@xmath15 at the 3  mm and 2  mm band , respectively , which corresponds to a linear scale of 1.20.9  kpc and 0.80.7  kpc , respectively .",
    "the observed frequency range is from 83 to 103.5 , from 108.5 to 116  ghz , and from 130 to 148  ghz for p1 , and from 85 to 116  ghz and from 139.3 to 142.3  ghz for p2 .",
    "since the frequency range from 100 to 109  ghz does not contain strong spectral lines according to spectral line surveys toward the galactic sources , we put a lower priority on observations of this frequency range within the limited observation time .",
    "two emir ( eight mixer receivers ) bands , e090 and e150 , were observed simultaneously with the dual polarization mode .",
    "the emir is the sideband separating receiver , which outputs the usb and lsb signals separately .",
    "the image rejection ratios are assured to be better than 13  db and 10  db for e090 and e150 , respectively , according to the status report of the 30  m telescope .",
    "the system temperatures ranged from 75 - 310  k for e090 and from 100 - 210  k for e150 .",
    "the detailed frequency settings , integration time , and system noise temperatures are summarized in table [ tab7 ] .",
    "the backends were eight fts ( fourier transform spectrometers ) autocorrelators whose bandwidth and channel width are 4050  mhz and 195  khz , respectively .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked every hour by observing continuum sources near the target position , and was found to be better than @xmath18 .",
    "the wobbler switching mode was employed with beam throw of @xmath19 and switching frequency of 0.5  hz . the wobbler throw is toward the azimuth direction , and hence , the absolute off - position depends on the hour angle . although the off - position is still within the m51 system , the emission of the off - position is smeared out for the long integrations in our line survey observation .",
    "in fact , we compared the co intensity with that of obtained by paws @xcite , and found that the off - position contribution is less than 10  % .",
    "hence , the effect would be almost negligible for the other molecular lines with higher critical densities .",
    "the intensity scale was calibrated to the antenna temperature ( @xmath20 ) scale by using cold and hot loads .",
    "@xmath20 was converted to the main beam temperature @xmath21 by multiplying @xmath22 . here",
    ", @xmath23 is forward efficiency , which is 95  % and 93  % for the 3  mm and 2  mm bands , respectively , and @xmath24 is main beam efficiency , which is 81  % and 74  % for the 3  mm and 2  mm bands , respectively .",
    "thanks to the wobbler switching , the spectrum baseline was stable .",
    "spectral baselines were subtracted for each correlator band ( 4050  mhz ) and for each scan by fitting a 5th - 7th order polynomial to the line - free part before the averaging of all the scans .",
    "then , the final spectrum for each correlator band was obtained by integrating all the scans .",
    "the composite spectrum was prepared by gathering the spectra thus obtained .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the composite spectra from 85 to 116  ghz toward p1 and p2 and that from 130 to 148  ghz in p1 .",
    "their expanded spectra are shown in appendix a. typical r.m.s .",
    "noise levels are 27  mk and 23  mk in the 3  mm and 2  mm bands , respectively for the spectral resolution of 4  mhz . in total",
    ", 21  lines and 5  lines were detected in the 3  mm and 2  mm bands , respectively , toward p1 ( figure [ fig3 ] and table [ tab1 ] ) , from which 13 molecular species and 6 isotopologues were identified with the aid of the spectral line database the cologne database for molecular spectroscopy ( cdms ) managed by university of cologne @xcite and submillimeter , millimeter , and microwave spectral line catalog provided by jet propulsion laboratory .",
    "the line parameters were obtained by gaussian fitting to the appropriate frequency range around the line which is much wider than the line width ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "a criterion of the detection is that the line is observed at the expected velocity ( @xmath25 km  s@xmath26 and @xmath27 km  s@xmath26 for p1 and p2 , respectively ) with a line width of 20  km  s@xmath26 or broader and a significance of 3@xmath28 or higher .",
    "the result is shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "in addition to @xmath5co , hcn , hco@xmath3 , hnc , and cs , which are usually found in the nuclear regions of many external galaxies , n@xmath29h@xmath3 , h@xmath29co , ch@xmath30oh , hnco , cch , cn , c - c@xmath30h@xmath29 , and so were detected toward p1 .",
    "as for isotopologues , h@xmath6cn , h@xmath6co@xmath3 , and c@xmath4s were identified , as well as @xmath6co , c@xmath7o , and c@xmath31o . toward p2 ,",
    "16 and 1 lines were detected in the 3  mm and 2  mm bands , respectively ( figure [ fig3 ] and table [ tab2 ] ) , from which 11 molecular species and 3 co isotopologues have been identified .",
    "although the observation sensitivities are almost the same between p1 and p2 , the number of detected lines is smaller in p2 than that in p1 .",
    "this is because the line intensities are about 1.5 times weaker in p2 than p1 .",
    "on the other hand , molecules often found in starburst galaxies and agns such as hc@xmath2n , ch@xmath2cn , ch@xmath30cch , ocs and sio were not detected in the spiral arm of m51 .",
    "although marginal features of the hc@xmath2n line were recognized at the expected frequencies ( 90.979023  ghz and 100.076392  ghz for the @xmath32 and @xmath33 lines ) in p1 , they are not statistically significant ( @xmath34 ) . moreover , deuterated species such as dcn , dco@xmath3 , and hdco were not detected .",
    "table [ tab1 ] also lists lines of representative non - detected species .",
    "the upper limits to the peak intensities are 3 times the r.m.s .",
    "noise at the spectral resolution of 4  mhz , whereas the upper limits to the integrated intensities are evaluated from the upper limits to the peak intensities by assuming a velocity width of 40  km  s@xmath26 . in general ,",
    "non - detection of the lines does not always mean low column densities , because the line may not be excited to give observable emission due to insufficient h@xmath0 density and/or low kinetic temperature .",
    "however , most of these non - detections do not originate from such an excitation problem , but are likely due to low abundances of these molecules .",
    "indeed , the hnco line ( @xmath35 ) whose upper state energy is as high as 22.2  k was detected .",
    "upper state energies of transitions of the above non - detected molecules are lower than those of the detected lines ( _ e.g. _ hnco ) , except for the hc@xmath2n(@xmath32 ) line ( @xmath36  k ) .",
    "it should be noted that non - detections are based on the averaged over the telescope beam .",
    "hence , the results do not rule out the possibility that they exist in very localized parts within the beam .      in this observation",
    ", multiple transition lines were detected for hnco , ch@xmath2oh , and cs .",
    "assuming an optically thin condition and local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , we determined the rotation temperatures and the beam - averaged column densities of these three molecules by using the least - square method with the following formula : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are integrated intensity , line strength , dipole moment , transition frequency , total column density , the boltzmann constant , partition function , rotation temperature , the planck constant , the cosmic microwave background temperature , and upper state energy , respectively .",
    "since we are looking at smaller regions than the telescope beam , we need to correct for the effect of beam dilution .",
    "this correction is particularly important for using the 2  mm and 3  mm data simultaneously , because the beam dilution effect is very different .",
    "the correction was made by dividing the observed integrated intensity by the beam dilution factor @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the source size and the @xmath52 beam width of the telescope .",
    "the @xmath52 beam width can be calculated as @xmath53 in arcsecond for the 30  m telescope . since , the size of the emitting region is uncertain and the emitting region may be different from molecule to molecule , we assumed three source sizes of 5@xmath15 , 10@xmath15 , and larger than the telescope beams .",
    "the rotation temperature and the column density of cs , ch@xmath2oh , and hnco were estimated toward p1 as shown in table [ tab3 ] . in the case of ch@xmath2oh",
    ", we need a special treatment , because the ch@xmath2oh lines consist of unresolved multiple transitions ( table [ tab1 ] ) . by assuming that the column density of the a - state @xmath42 is the same as that of the e - state",
    ", the intensity of ch@xmath2oh can be expressed as : @xmath54 here , @xmath55 denotes an index of each transition , and @xmath56 stands for the partition function of the a or e - state depending on the state that the @xmath55th line belongs to . for p2 ,",
    "the rotation temperature was not determined accurately because of poor s / n ratios of the lines .",
    "the rotation temperatures obtained toward p1 are similar to those found in cold dark clouds . from this result",
    ", the detected molecules would reside in a cold ( @xmath57  k ) and widespread molecular gas , although a part of the molecular emissions may also come from hot molecular gas affected by the feedback from the star formation activities .",
    "indeed , the spectral intensity patterns obtained in this survey are much different from those found in hot cores in high - mass star forming regions such as orion  kl @xcite",
    ". the observed spectra can not be reproduced by an assembly of molecular gas in hot cores .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the single dish observation which samples many gmcs within the telescope beam .",
    "column densities of other molecules , for which only one line was observed , were estimated under the assumption of the lte with a rotation temperature ( @xmath45 ) of 5  k and 10  k by using eq .",
    "( 1 ) ( table [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the identified molecules , upper limits to column densities were derived for 12 non - detected molecules ( table [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "for h@xmath0co in p1 , the column density was estimated by summing the column densities of ortho - h@xmath0co and para - h@xmath0co , which were derived from transitions of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "for h@xmath0co in p2 , the ortho - to para ratio is assumed to be 3 ( the statistical value ) . the ortho - to - para ratios",
    "are also assumed to be 3 for c - c@xmath2h@xmath0 , and h@xmath0cs .",
    "the upper limits for ch@xmath2cch and ch@xmath2cn were evaluated by assuming equal column densities for the a and e states .",
    "fractional abundances were calculated by using the column density of molecular hydrogen derived from the column density of c@xmath7o , as summarized in table [ tab4 ] . here ,",
    "the [ h@xmath0]/[c@xmath7o ] ratio of @xmath61 @xcite is employed . for simplicity",
    ", we assumed that all the molecular species have the same size of the emitting regions .",
    "although the column densities are strongly dependent on the assumed source sizes , the fractional abundances do not change very much .",
    "we also calculated the column densities of ch@xmath2oh with this method , and confirmed that these column densities are consistent with those determined by the multiple line analysis within a factor of 2.5 . in the following , we use the column densities of ch@xmath2oh , hnco and cs estimated by lte approximation with @xmath62 of 5  k in order to discuss the abundances of various molecules on an equal footing .",
    "the h@xmath6cn , h@xmath6co@xmath3 and c@xmath4s lines are detected in p1 .",
    "the isotope ratios are evaluated as : [ hcn]/[h@xmath6cn ] = @xmath63 , [ hco@xmath1]/[h@xmath6co@xmath1 ] = @xmath65 , and [ cs]/[c@xmath4s ] = @xmath66 .",
    "these values are lower than normal isotope ratios in the solar neighborhood : [ @xmath5c]/[@xmath6c ] = 59 and [ @xmath67s]/[@xmath4s ] = 22 .",
    "hence , these normal spectral lines may be optically thick , if the solar neighborhood values of the isotope ratios could be applied to m51 .",
    "the [ @xmath7o]/[@xmath31o ] ratio is derived to be @xmath68 from the c@xmath7o and c@xmath31o data .",
    "since the lines of these two molecules are usually optically thin , the derived [ @xmath7o]/[@xmath31o ] ratio would be reliable .",
    "the measured ratio is similar to or slightly higher than those observed in nuclear regions of external galaxies ( 610 ) @xcite , while it is higher than the galactic value of 35 .",
    "hc@xmath2n has been detected in many external galaxies ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fractional abundances of hc@xmath2n averaged over the 1-kpc scale region in m51 are evaluated to be less than @xmath69 in p1 and p2 .",
    "they are lower by a factor of two than those in ic  342 ( @xmath70 : * ? ? ?",
    "however , the ic  342 result is based on gmc - scale resolution ( 30  pc ) .",
    "@xcite reported that the intensity ratios of hc@xmath2n(109)/hcn(10 ) are 0.050.78 in the nuclear regions of external galaxies ( resolution of 0.2  24  kpc ) .",
    "the ratio observed in m51  p1 is much lower ( @xmath71 0.020.04 ) than their values .",
    "this result indicates that the abundance of hc@xmath2n is lower in the spiral arm of m51 in the 1-kpc scale than in the nuclear regions .",
    "the excitation conditions are likely not the reason for the lower intensity ratio , because the hnco(@xmath72@xmath73 ) line which has a similar upper - state energy to that of the hc@xmath30n(109 ) line , is observed as mentioned before . if hc@xmath2n is confined in a small dense region , the difference of the spatial resolution would result in different detectability of this molecule .",
    "the upper limits to deuterium fractionation ratios are found to be less than 0.8% and 1.2  % for dco@xmath1/hco@xmath1 and dcn / hcn , respectively . here , the column densities of hcn and hco@xmath1 are estimated from the normal species lines , because of the large uncertainty of the line intensities of the @xmath6c isotopologues . therefore , the deuterium fractionation ratios would be smaller than these values , if the normal species lines are optically thick . the upper limit to",
    "the dcn / hcn ratio is comparable to those reported for galactic star forming regions ( orion : 0.1 - 2  % ) @xcite and also cold dark clouds ( 1  % ) @xcite , while it is lower than those found in low - mass protostars ( 26  % ) @xcite .",
    "it is known that the deuterium fractionation ratios of molecules are as high as 10  % for evolved starless cores without star formation @xcite .",
    "this is because they are enhanced in the later stage of prestellar cores due to a high degree of co depletion onto dust grains .",
    "the lower deuterium fractionation ratios in m51  p1 and p2 seem reasonable , because our single - dish observation samples less dense molecular clouds without heavy co depletion occurring .",
    "emitting regions could be different from molecule to molecule within the telescope beam . in order to examine this",
    ", we prepared a correlation plot between the line of sight velocities and the line widths ( fwhm ) determined by gaussian fitting to the spectra in p1 ( figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the lines of co , hco@xmath3 , and cs tend to have relatively broader line widths in comparison with the other molecular lines , probably because these molecules are widely distributed in the spiral arm . the hcn , cch , cn , and ch@xmath2oh lines are broadened by blending of unresolved hyperfine components or internal rotation components .",
    "the optical depth effect would also broaden the line width for co , hco@xmath3 , and cs . in spite of these broadenings ,",
    "molecular lines with relatively narrow line width tend to be blue - shifted relative to the velocity of the @xmath5co line , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] .    with the @xmath74 resolution observation with carma",
    ", @xcite found that massive gma ( giant molecular association ) cores ( gmc complexes ) have blue - shifted velocities relative to the average velocity of the spiral arm .",
    "these massive gma cores are spatially located downstream of the spiral arm .",
    "therefore , molecules showing blue - shifted emissions could preferentially reside in the massive gma cores identified by @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the slight velocity differences may reflect different spatial distribution of molecular line emission within the beam .",
    "this has to be confirmed by high resolution observations with interferometers .",
    "with this unbiased spectral line survey , we have revealed the chemical compositions averaged over the 1-kpc region in the spiral arm of m51 .",
    "this is the first systematic frequency scan toward a spiral arm in a nearby disk galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows a correlation plot of fractional abundances between the p1 and p2 positions , where a source size of @xmath75 is assumed . the correlation plot does not change significantly with the assumed source size .",
    "a good correlation of the abundances can be seen between the two positions .",
    "although the abundance of cn is about 1.5 times higher in p1 , most of the fractional abundance ratios between p1 and p2 are in a narrow range from 0.8 to 1.3 .",
    "when the uncertainty in each abundance is taken into account , the chemical composition can be regarded to be similar between p1 and p2 . on the other hand ,",
    "star formation activities are higher in p1 than in p2 , because the p1 position is bright in the h@xmath17 and the 24  @xmath76 m ( figure [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the star formation rate ( sfr ) in p1 is estimated to be twice as high as in p2 on the basis of the 24  @xmath76 m and h@xmath17 data obtained by @xcite , where the sfrs are derived to be @xmath77  m@xmath78  yr@xmath26 and @xmath79  m@xmath78  yr@xmath26 for p1 and p2 , respectively , using the method by @xcite ( appendix b ) .",
    "the star formation efficiency , which is estimated from the sfr divided by the molecular gas mass , is 1.5 times higher in p1 ( @xmath80  yr@xmath26 ) than in p2 ( @xmath81  yr@xmath26 ) , where the molecular gas mass is calculated to be @xmath82  m@xmath78 and @xmath83  m@xmath78 for p1 and p2 , respectively , from the c@xmath7o data obtained in this study .",
    "hence , the star formation activity does not directly affect the chemical composition averaged over the 1-kpc scale region .",
    "although the chemical composition of star forming regions is known to be different from that in quiescent molecular clouds as observed in the galactic sources , such as effect of star formation is diluted by the large observation beam .",
    "thus , the observed chemical composition primarily reflects that of the whole molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite also discussed that star formation activities have no strong impact on the physical condition of molecular gas in the spiral arms at a linear resolution of 180  pc .",
    "it is known that cch and cn are deficient in high - mass star forming regions and are rather abundant in cloud envelopes @xcite .",
    "high abundances of these molecules are consistent with the picture that the observed chemical composition represents the gmc scale one .",
    "the relatively high abundance of ch@xmath2oh is , on the other hand , interesting , which is discussed in section 4.3 .",
    "according to observational studies of nearby molecular cloud cores in the galaxy , chemical compositions gradually changes along cloud evolution with a time scale of 10@xmath84  yr .",
    "if the dynamical time scale of clouds is less than this , a chemical evolution effect can be observed ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the dynamical time scale of 10  pc cloud , which is typical size of gmc , is roughly estimated to be a few @xmath85  yr , which corresponds to transit time of the cloud with the sound speed of the 0.3  km  s@xmath26 , at the kinetic temperature of 15  k is @xcite .",
    "hence , such an chemical evolution effect will not be important for the gmc - scale chemical composition .",
    "chemical compositions reflect complex physical structures and conditions within the telescope beam .",
    "hence , it is generally difficult to discuss pure chemistry based on well - defined conditions , particularly for external galaxies",
    ". nevertheless , we can learn about the physical structure and conditions of the molecular gas from its chemical composition to some extent without resolving the source , because the different chemical compositions imply the different physical situations .",
    "hence , it is worth highlighting the chemical signatures specific to agns and starbursts by comparing their chemical compositions with those without such extreme activities ( _ e.g. _ those of m51  p1 and 2 ) .",
    "this is an important step for chemical diagnostics of external galaxies , and our spectral line survey toward m51  p1 and p2 is of fundamental importance in giving a reference template of molecular abundances in a spiral arm of a disk galaxy .    for demonstrating how surrounding environments affect chemical compositions of gmcs",
    ", we compare the chemical composition of m51 p1 with those reported previously for the nuclear regions of other external galaxies with starbursts and agns . although these chemical compositions sample different size scales ( 0.31.5  kpc )",
    ", we should be able to extract relations between such macroscopic chemical compositions and physical processes occurring therein . here ,",
    "only m51  p1 is compared with other sources , because m51  p2 has a similar chemical composition to that of p1 .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows correlation plots of the fractional abundances of m51  p1 against the starburst regions in ngc  253 and m82 , as well as the agn in ngc  1068 . for these sources ,",
    "the fractional abundances are calculated by using the h@xmath0 column density estimated from the c@xmath7o data , assuming that [ h@xmath0]/[c@xmath7o ] = @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig7 ] ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) represent the results for ngc  253 , m82 , and ngc  1068 , respectively .",
    "overall , molecular abundances of these sources correlate with that of m51 p1 . however , the correlations are loose in comparison with that between m51 p1 and p2 .",
    "this means that chemical composition of each source is different from that of m51 p1 because of an environmental effect . here , we highlight some characteristic features of each source below .",
    "ngc  253 is a nearby ( 3.4  mpc : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) starburst galaxy and classified as sab(s)c .",

    "alternatively , it is worth considering non - thermal desorption of ch@xmath2oh as a possibility .",
    "the main formation process of ch@xmath2oh is considered to be hydrogenation of the co molecule on dust grains under a low temperature condition @xcite .",
    "hence , high temperature conditions ( @xmath96  k ) or energetic phenomena are required for liberation of ch@xmath2oh into the gas phase . for instance , ch@xmath2oh has been detected in shocked regions caused by an impact of outflows from protostars ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is often regarded as a shock tracer as mentioned above .",
    "nevertheless , ch@xmath2oh exists in the cold widespread gas of m51  p1 and p2 observed with our telescope beam . hence , its origin is of great interest . we examine the required liberation rate to account for the observed ch@xmath2oh abundances in the gas phase .    for simplicity ,",
    "we consider evaporation , depletion , and gas - phase destruction with ions .",
    "the rate equation for ch@xmath2oh is approximately written as : @xmath97}{dt } = n_{\\rm g } k_{\\rm ev } - k_{\\rm d } [ { \\rm ch_3oh } ] - k_{\\rm r}[{\\rm ch_3oh}][{\\rm m^+ } ] , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the liberation rate coefficient of ch@xmath2oh per dust grain , @xmath99 is the number density of dust grains , @xmath100 is the rate coefficient of depletion of ch@xmath2oh onto dust grain , and @xmath101 is the total rate coefficient for reactions of ch@xmath2oh with various ions m@xmath1 ( m@xmath1 = h@xmath1 , h@xmath102 , hco@xmath1 , and he@xmath1 ) . assuming the steady - state condition , equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is modified to : @xmath103)}{x_{\\rm g}}.\\ ] ] here , we approximately assume that @xmath104 \\sim [ { \\rm e}]$ ] , where @xmath105 $ ] is a number density of electrons in the gas phase .",

    "the following parameters are assumed : @xmath110  s@xmath26 @xmath111  s@xmath26 @xcite , @xmath112  @xmath113  s@xmath26 ( a typical langevin rate coefficient ) , @xmath105 \\sim 10^{-5 } \\times \\sqrt{n({\\rm h_2})}$ ]  @xmath109 @xmath114  @xmath109 , and @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath98 is required to be @xmath116  s@xmath26 in order to reproduce the observed value of @xmath106 of @xmath117 .",
    "when the h@xmath0 density of @xmath118  @xmath109 is assumed , @xmath98 has to be @xmath119  s@xmath26 .",
    "this liberation rate can be compared with that in the nearby quiescent starless core l134n . in this source ,",
    "the fractional abundance of ch@xmath2oh is @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "hence , the liberation rate is evaluated to be @xmath121  s@xmath26 for an h@xmath0 density of @xmath122  @xmath109 by using equation ( 4 ) .",
    "this value is comparable to that found in m51  p1 , although the spatial scale is much different .",
    "the liberation mechanism of ch@xmath2oh is unclear . in order to thermally desorb the ch@xmath2oh molecules from dust grains , the temperature has to be as high as 100  k. in the spiral arm of m51 , the star formation activity is not a potential mechanism , because the star formation feedback seems to be localized to small areas .",
    "indeed , our survey shows no enhancement of the ch@xmath2oh fractional abundance in p1 which shows higher star formation activities than in p2 . a possible mechanism is a large - scale shock such as spiral shocks and cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "indeed , an enhancement of ch@xmath2oh has been observed in the central spiral arm regions of ic  342 @xcite and maffei  2 @xcite , which are confirmed as shocked regions by observations of the shock tracer sio .",
    "the abundances of ch@xmath2oh are estimated to be @xmath123 and @xmath124 in ic  342 and maffei  2 @xcite , respectively .",
    "these abundances are similar to or higher than those of m51 , although the spatial resolution of the ic  342 and maffei  2 observation is much higher ( 50  120  pc ) than that of our m51 observation . alternatively ,",
    "non - thermal desorption process such as photoevaporation by cosmic - ray induced uv photons ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be responsible for evaporation of ch@xmath2oh . since l134n",
    "does not show any evidence of shocks , the origin of ch@xmath2oh is likely the non- thermal desorption process .",
    "if the cosmic ray flux in m51  p1 is comparable to that in l134n , this mechanism can explain the observed abundance of ch@xmath2oh . in any case",
    ", it seems important to explore the distribution of ch@xmath2oh in m51  p1 with higher angular resolution in order to assess the evaporation mechanism .",
    "we carried out a spectral line survey toward two positions ( p1 and p2 ) in the spiral arm of the nearby galaxy m51 in the 3  mm and 2  mm bands with the iram 30  m telescope .",
    "this is the first systematic frequency - scan toward a spiral arm of a nearby galaxy , and the result can be used as a template for the 1-kpc scale chemical composition of a spiral arm .",
    "main results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "thirteen molecular species , cch , cn , hcn , hnc , co , hco@xmath1 , h@xmath0co , ch@xmath2oh , n@xmath0h@xmath1 , c - c@xmath2h@xmath0 , hnco , cs , and so were identified in p1 . in addition , six isotopologues , @xmath6co , c@xmath31o , c@xmath7o , h@xmath6co@xmath1 , h@xmath6cn , and c@xmath4s were identified .",
    "eleven molecular species and three co isotopologues were found in p2 .",
    "hc@xmath2n , ch@xmath2cn , ch@xmath2cch , and sio , which are often detected in the nuclear regions of nearby galaxies , were not detected in the both observed positions .",
    "the upper limit to the column density of hc@xmath2n is much lower than those found in nuclear regions such as m82 s one .",
    "deuterated species such as dcn and dco@xmath1 were not detected in this survey , either .",
    "the upper limits to the deuterium fractionation ratios are comparable to those in galactic star - forming cores and young dark clouds ( tmc-1 ) , whereas they are lower than those in low - mass star forming regions .",
    "4 .   p1 and p2 are found to have almost identical chemical composition , although the star formation efficiency in p1 is 1.5 times higher than that in p2 .",
    "therefore , a small difference of star formation activities has little influence on the chemical composition averaged over the 1-kpc scale region in the spiral arm .",
    "the chemical compositions of m51  p1 is found to be loosely correlated with those of starbursts and agns .",
    "the difference of chemical compositions between m51 p1 and the nuclear regions , such as enhancement of cs in the nuclear regions may be attributed to the extreme environments such as high uv or x - ray radiation fields in the nuclear regions .",
    "ch@xmath2oh is found to be abundant in the molecular gas in the spiral arm . because ch@xmath2oh is thought to be formed on the dust mantle , some liberation mechanisms are necessary .",
    "a shock induced by kpc - scale dynamics such as cloud - cloud collisions , as well as non - thermal desorption processes , could be potential mechanisms .",
