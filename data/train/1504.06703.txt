    "in the early 80 s michael freedman stunned the mathematical world by obtaining a complete classification of all closed simply connected topological 4-manifolds ( @xcite ) .",
    "he was able to show that the homeomorphism type of a closed simply connected topological 4-manifold was characterised by two invariants .",
    "the first one was the intersection form @xmath1 which is a symmetric bilinear form having determinant @xmath2 .",
    "the second is the kirby - seibenmann invariant , which is an element @xmath3 that vanishes if and only if the product @xmath4 admits a smooth structure ( see @xcite p.221 - 222 ) .",
    "furthermore , he was able to show that given an arbitrary integral symmetric bilinear form @xmath5 with determinant @xmath2 , there exists a closed simply connected topological 4-manifold that has @xmath5 as its intersection form .",
    "the number of definite forms is enormous , coupled with the classification theorem of freedman this shows that the number of closed simply connected topological 4-manifolds whose intersection form is definite is enormous .",
    "one could try and exclude some of these forms by restricting to those manifolds that admit a smooth structure , but unfortunately freedman s theorem does not say anything about a diffeomorphism classification of smooth 4-manifolds , and on the existence of smooth structures .",
    "during that time there was no way of ruling out the possibility that the enormous number of topological 4-manifolds with definite intersection form admitted a smooth structure .",
    "+ just one year after freedman s work a second revolution occurred in the 4-manifold world .",
    "simon donaldson ( @xcite ) , using techniques from gauge theory , was able to show that the only definite forms that arose as the intersection form of a closed smooth simply connected 4-manifold were @xmath6 \\text { and } \\oplus_n[-1]\\ ] ] along with the work of freedman , this immediately implied that the overwhelming crowd of topological 4-manifolds with definite intersection forms was mainly populated by ones that did not admit a smooth structure . a result",
    "many mathematicians did not see coming .",
    "freedman s work together with the work of donaldson refines the classification theorem for closed smooth simply connected 4-manifolds , and can be expressed in the following simple form .",
    "_ every closed smooth simply connected 4-manifold is homeomorphic to either _ @xmath7 here @xmath8 denotes the non - smoothable topological 4-manifold with the @xmath9 intersection form .",
    "although this theorem may seem somewhat unsatisfactory , since many of the @xmath10 are non - smoothable .",
    "it has proved to be invaluable in our understanding of 4-manifolds .",
    "the aim of this paper is to try and understand which homeomorphism types , in the donaldson - freedman classification theorem , can contain a codimension two link complement that admits a hyperbolic structure . by hyperbolic structure we will always mean a finite volume hyperbolic structure . the first piece of work that was done in investigating this type of question was carried out by d. ivan@xmath11i@xmath12 in @xcite .",
    "in that paper ivan@xmath11i@xmath12 constructed a comdimension two link complement in a closed smooth 4-manifold that was homeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "the starting point for his construction was to analyse the orientable double cover of a non - orientable finite volume hyperbolic 4-manifold constructed by j. ratcliffe and s. tschantz . in @xcite ratcliffe and tschantz",
    "construct 1171 non - compact finite volume hyperbolic 4-manifolds , with 22 of them being orientable and 1149 being non- orientable , each of euler characteristic @xmath14 .",
    "ivan@xmath11i@xmath12 shows that the orientable double cover of the one numbered 1011 has five cusps , with each cusp cross - section given by the 3-torus . by gluing in a solid 3-torus to each cusp cross - section via the identity map , he showed that you would obtain a closed smooth simply connected 4-manifold whose euler characteristic was @xmath15 .",
    "using the donaldson - freedman classification theorem he was able to conclude that the closed smooth simply connected 4-manifold he obtained , through this gluing process , was homeomorphic to @xmath13 . in this way",
    "he had produced the first example of a codimension two hyperbolic link complement in a 4-manifold that was homeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "soon after d. ivan@xmath11i@xmath12 , j. ratcliffe , and s. tschantz constructed several more examples of codimension two hyperbolic link complements in 4-manifolds that were homeomorphic to @xmath13 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the starting point of this paper is to construct many more examples of codimension two hyperbolic link complements in closed smooth simply connected 4-manifolds , whose homeomorphism type we can classify .",
    "we show how to construct codimension two link complements in smooth 4-manifolds whose homeomorphism type is given by @xmath16 for @xmath17 .    for @xmath17",
    "there exists a collection of @xmath18 tori embedded in a smooth 4-manifold @xmath19 such that @xmath19 is homeomorphic to @xmath16 , and @xmath20 admits a finite volume hyperbolic structure .",
    "our approach to proving the above theorem starts by constructing certain finite covers of the orientable double cover of the hyperbolic manifold numbered 1011 in the list constructed by ratcliffe and tschantz .",
    "the cusps of each of these covers each have a cross - section given by the 3-torus .",
    "we show that if we glue in a solid 3-torus , via the identity , we obtain a closed smooth simply connected 4-manifold that admits a spin structure . then using work of d. long and a. reid on the signature of a non - compact finite volume hyperbolic 4-manifold ( @xcite )",
    ", we prove that the signature of these closed 4-manifolds must vanish .",
    "these two results are enough to classify the homeomorphism type of the closed 4-manifolds , obtained from gluing in solid 3-tori to each cusp cross - section , and obtain the above theorem .    the second , and final ,",
    "goal of the paper is to understand whether all the homeomorphism types of smooth 4-manifolds , occurring in the donaldson - freedman classification theorem , can contain a codimension two link complement that admits a hyperbolic structure .",
    "for example , one of the homeomorphism types occurring in the donaldson - freedman classification theorem is given by @xmath21 .",
    "the fact that this admits a smooth structure follows from the observation that it has the same intersection form , given by @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 denotes the hyperbolic form ) , as a @xmath24 surface .",
    "one can then ask if a @xmath24 surface contains a codimension two link complement that admits a hyperbolic structure ?",
    "we are able to show that this can not be the case , and in fact many homeomorphism types , occurring in the donaldson - freedman classification , can not contain a codimension two link complement that admits a hyperbolic structure .",
    "our main theorem , in regards to this second goal , takes the following form .",
    "let @xmath25 be a closed smooth simply connected 4-manifold that has a codimension two link complement that admits a hyperbolic structure .",
    "then the homeomorphism type of @xmath25 falls into one of the following three categories :    * @xmath13 * @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "* @xmath28 , @xmath27 .",
    "we prove this theorem by showing that any such closed smooth 4-manifold that contains a codimension two link complement that admits a hyperbolic structure must have vanishing signature .",
    "this immediately gives the above result .",
    "i would like to thank andras juhasz and marc lackenby for finding an error in an earlier version of this work , and for their help in repairing this error .",
    "i would like to thank igor belegradek for providing a useful reference on eta invariants .",
    "finally , i must thank john parker for his valuable comments on an earlier version of this work",
    "in this section we will introduce the reader to the ratcliffe - tschantz hyperbolic 4-manifolds .",
    "each of their hyperbolic 4-manifolds has the hyperbolic 24-cell , a four dimensional self dual polyhedron , as a fundamental domain . in view of this",
    "we start by describing how the hyperbolic 24-cell is constructed , and the notation we will be using to describe it .",
    "we then state the main theorem we will need from their paper @xcite , and explain the coding they developed to identify each of the 1171 hyperbolic 4-manifolds they constructed .",
    "let @xmath29 denote a sphere of radius 1 centred at a point in @xmath30 whose coordinates have two @xmath31 s and whose other two coordinates are both zero .",
    "for example @xmath32 denotes the sphere of radius 1 centred at the point @xmath33 in @xmath30 .",
    "if we let @xmath34 denote the ball model of hyperbolic 4-space then we find that all the spheres @xmath29 intersect the sphere at infinity orthogonally .",
    "this implies that each such sphere determines a hyperplane in @xmath34 .",
    "if we let @xmath35 denote the corresponding half - space that contains the origin , and then take the intersection of all such half - spaces , we find that we obtain a 24-sided polyhedron in @xmath34 .",
    "this polyhedron is known as the hyperbolic 24-cell , and we will denote it by @xmath36 .",
    "it is a four dimensional self dual polyhedron .",
    "we will denote the side of @xmath36 that lies on the sphere @xmath29 also by @xmath29 .",
    "all the dihedral angles of @xmath36 are @xmath37 and it has twenty - four ideal vertices .",
    "we can explicitly describe each ideal vertex : we have 8 vertices of the form @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 plus 16 vertices of the form @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath43 be the group of @xmath44 positive lorentzian matrices with integer entries .",
    "the group @xmath43 is an infinite discrete subgroup of the group @xmath45 of lorentzian @xmath44 matrices .",
    "the principal congruence two subgroup of @xmath43 is the group @xmath46 of all matrices in @xmath43 that are congruent to the identity matrix modulo two . in their paper @xcite ratcliffe and",
    "tschantz classify all the hyperbolic space forms @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a torsion free subgroup of minimal index in the group @xmath49 ( they actually do the case @xmath50 as well but as we are only interested in the @xmath51 case we will not worry about these other two ) .",
    "their main theorem takes the form :    there are , up to isometry , exactly 1171 hyperbolic space - forms @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a torsion free subgroup of minimal index in the group @xmath49 .",
    "only 22 of these manifolds are orientable .",
    "each of the 1171 hyperbolic 4-manifolds coming from the above theorem have euler characteristic @xmath14 .",
    "the proof of this theorem which leads to the construction of the 1171 hyperbolic space - forms @xmath47 involves finding suitable side pairings of the 24-cell that will give rise to hyperbolic 4-manifolds .",
    "the interested reader can consult p.111 of @xcite for the details of the proof .",
    "all their side pairings are of the form @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entry taking the form @xmath54 , which is to be interpreted as a composition of reflections in the coordinate planes @xmath55 for @xmath56 . in order to identify a particular element @xmath53",
    "it suffices to simply give the diagonal @xmath54 , where a @xmath57 in some position tells us that we reflect in the coordinate corresponding to that position , and a @xmath58 tell us that we do nothing .",
    "for example @xmath59 is the composition of reflection in @xmath60 followed by reflection in @xmath61 .",
    "ratcliffe and tschantz develop a coding system for the @xmath53-part of each side pairing transformation which we now describe .",
    "the polyhedron @xmath36 has 24 three dimensional sides , since a side pairing transformation must identify pairs of sides we need to give twelve transformations",
    ". we will denote these transformations by the letters @xmath62 .",
    "we then group the letters @xmath63 and the sides of @xmath36 into the following groups : @xmath64 @xmath65 in each of the above sets the letters are pairings between the spheres in that set ( remember the spheres represent the sides of the 24-cell @xmath36 by the way we constructed it ) .",
    "we give the sides the ordering @xmath66 .",
    "so for example taking the first group above our order tells us that @xmath67 the first letter always pairs the side with @xmath68 to one of the other sides ( we will show how to determine this side ) , and the second letter pairs the next unused side ( with respect to the above ordering ) with the last side .",
    "the actual side pairing transformations are encoded by a string of six characters from the set @xmath69 one character for each of the above sets .",
    "each character represents a particular @xmath53-part , and the following table shows the correspondence :    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +   +   + the closed flat 3-manifold given by * g * is a non - orientable @xmath70-fibre bundle .",
    "the parabolic translations that correspond to the @xmath70-fibre are given by @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath53 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the starting point to obtaining a kirby diagram for the orientable double cover is to identify the orientation preserving isometries and those that are orientation reversing .",
    "recall , any side pairing transformation is written as the composition @xmath52 , where @xmath75 is reflection in the image side and @xmath53 is a diagonal matrix .",
    "it is clear that @xmath75 is orientation reversing ( since it is a reflection in a hyperplane ) , therefore we can conclude that the orientation preserving isometries are those whose @xmath53-part has an odd number of @xmath57 s , and the orientation reversing isometries are those that have an even number of @xmath57 s .",
    "we then find that the orientation preserving isometries are given by @xmath76 , and the orientation reversing isometries are given by @xmath77 .    a fundamental domain for the orientable double cover consists of two copies of the 24-cell @xmath36 attached along a codimension one side corresponding to one of the orientation reversing isometries .",
    "if we take the orientation reversing isometry @xmath78 , then we can think of the fundamental domain of the orientable double cover to consist of the union @xmath79 .",
    "in our paper @xcite we showed how to compute the side pairing transformations associated to the orientable double cover of any one of the non - orientable ratcliffe - tschantz manifolds using the reidemeister - schreier rewriting process .",

    "the same construction outlined in that paper also works in this case .",
    "as we will not need the details of the construction we will simply show the reader what the kirby diagram looks like .",
    "the totality of the kirby diagram will be split into four separate diagrams .",
    "each diagram contains two sub diagrams corresponding to the fact that a fundamental domain for @xmath80 consists of two components , @xmath36 and @xmath87 .",
    "the first diagram shows the @xmath88 plane of the kirby diagram coming from @xmath36 and @xmath87 .",
    "the second and third diagrams show the @xmath89 and @xmath90 planes respectively of the kirby diagram coming from @xmath36 and @xmath87 .",
    "finally , there are always twelve 2-handles that do not all lie in any one of these three planes , the fourth diagram shows how these 2-handles look like . in total",
    "there are twenty four 1-handles and forty eight 2-handles , with twelve 2-handles in each of the @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 planes , and another twelve that do not all lie in any one of these planes . in the following diagrams for each side @xmath91",
    "we denote the component of the 1-handle corresponding to @xmath92 by @xmath93 .",
    "the attaching maps for the attaching regions of the 1-handles are given by the above side pairing transformations .",
    "as the kirby diagram is split into four separate diagrams we colour code the 2-handles in each of the four diagrams by twelve distinct colours .",
    "the following diagram shows that part of the kirby diagram contained in the @xmath88 plane .",
    "that part of the kirby diagram contained in the @xmath89 plane can be seen in the following diagram .",
    "that part of the kirby diagram contained in the @xmath90 plane can be seen in the following diagram .",
    "we said that the above shows that part of the kirby diagram contained in the @xmath90 plane .",
    "this is not exactly true , what we mean by this is that in the above diagram the component on the left shows the @xmath90 plane of the kirby diagram coming from the @xmath36 part of the fundamental domain @xmath94 .",
    "the component on the right shows the @xmath90 plane of the kirby diagram coming from the @xmath87 part .",
    "finally , we have the 2-handles that do not all lie in any one of the above planes , there are twelve in total .",
    "observe that in the diagrams showing the @xmath88 and @xmath90 planes , there is a 2-handle running between @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "this 2-handle comes about due to the fact that when we form the fundamental domain for @xmath80 we take @xmath36 and transform it across the side @xmath95 by applying @xmath78 .",
    "hence the 2-handle is needed to cancel the 1-handle @xmath97 .",
    "the double cover @xmath80 is also a five cusped hyperbolic 4-manifold with each cusp having type @xmath98 , the 3-torus ( this is because the orientable double cover of @xmath99 is @xmath98 ) . in @xcite d.",
    "ivan@xmath11i@xmath12 proves that @xmath80 is a codimension two hyperbolic link complement in a closed smooth 4-manifold that is homeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "the basic idea behind his proof is as follows .",
    "the hyperbolic 4-manifold @xmath25 has five cusps each having type @xmath99 , which is an @xmath70-fibre bundle .",
    "being an @xmath70-fibre bundle means @xmath99 bounds a natural 4-manifold , the associated disk bundle . by gluing in these disk bundles to each cusp cross - section of @xmath25 , via the identity , one obtains a closed 4-manifold for which @xmath25 is a hyperbolic link complement in .",
    "algebraically the gluing in of disk bundles corresponds to adding certain parabolic transformations to a presentation of the fundamental group of @xmath25 .",
    "therefore in each parabolic subgroup corresponding to each cusp there exists a parabolic translation corresponding to the @xmath70-fibre .",
    "the parabolic translations are given by @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath53 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "he then finds a finite presentation of the fundamental group of @xmath25 and adds the relations @xmath100 .",
    "he then shows that by adding these extra relations to the fundamental group one obtains the group @xmath101 . in other words gluing in the associated disk bundles to each cusp cross - section produces a closed 4-manifold with fundamental group @xmath101 , which we denote by @xmath102 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath102 must have euler characteristic equal to that of @xmath25 , which is @xmath14 ( remember all the ratcliffe - tschantz manifolds have euler characteristic @xmath14 ) .",
    "this is because a flat manifold has euler characteristic zero , so gluing in a disk bundle associated to a flat @xmath70-fibre bundle can not change the euler characteristic .",
    "the orientable double cover of @xmath102 , which we denote by @xmath103 , is a closed simply connected 4-manifold of euler characteristic @xmath15 . it is easy to see that @xmath80 is a hyperbolic link complement in @xmath103 .",
    "applying the donaldson - freedman classification theorem ( see theorem [ simple_connec ] ) ivan@xmath11i@xmath12 is able to conclude that @xmath103 is homeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "ivan@xmath11i@xmath12 s theorem shows us that if we glue in solid 3-tori to each cusp cross - section of the orientable double cover @xmath80 we produce a closed 4-manifold that is homeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "we should point out that because the 3-torus fibres over the 2-torus in more than one way the gluing in of a solid 3-torus to a cusp cross - section is not unique .",
    "it depends on a choice of what we identify as the @xmath70-fibre , or put another way the gluing in of a solid 3-torus depends on a choice of a meridian .",
    "our construction of codimension two hyperbolic link complements in 4-manifolds with homeomorphism type @xmath16 proceeds in a similar way .",
    "we construct certain finite covers of @xmath80 , which must have cusp cross - sections given by the 3-torus @xmath98 .",
    "we then `` fill in '' these manifolds by gluing in solid 3-tori via the identity map , with respect to a choice of meridian , to produce a closed 4-manifold . from here",
    "on in we will refer to the gluing in of disk bundles to the cusp cross - sections of a hyperbolic 4-manifold via the identity map as a `` filling '' of that manifold .",
    "we then prove that these fillings must be spin and have vanishing signature .",
    "an appeal to the donaldson - freedman classification theorem allows us to determine the homeomorphism type of these fillings .",
    "[ spin_str ]    in this section we are going to prove that @xmath80 is a spin 4-manifold .",
    "we do this by using the construction of a kirby diagram of @xmath80 outlined in the previous section , and the fact that the second stiefel - whitney class can be interpreted as a cocycle whose value on each 2-handle is the framing coefficient of that 2-handle .    let @xmath104 be a real vector bundle over a 4-manifold @xmath19 , which we assume from here on in is orientable .",
    "we also assume that the fibres of @xmath104 have dimension @xmath105 , this will always be the case of interest for us . in the general case",
    "one can sum with a trivial bundle to obtain this condition . to construct a _",
    "spin structure _ we begin with a trivialisation of @xmath106 , where @xmath107 denotes the 1-skeleton of @xmath19 .",
    "we wish to extend this trivialisation @xmath108 over each 2-handle @xmath109 of @xmath19 .",
    "the 2-handle @xmath109 is a copy of @xmath110 , which being contractible implies @xmath111 is trivial , so @xmath108 over the attaching circle determines an element of @xmath112 ( as we are assuming @xmath105 ) .",
    "it is then clear that @xmath108 extends over @xmath109 if and only if this element in @xmath101 vanishes . applying this to each 2-handle @xmath109 of @xmath19 we obtain an element of @xmath101 assigned to each 2- handle . in other words , using the handle complex we obtain a cochain @xmath113 .",
    "one can then prove that if we were to take another trivialisation @xmath114 to start with , the cochains @xmath115 and @xmath116 will differ by a coboundary .",
    "furthermore one can prove that for any trivialisation @xmath108 , @xmath115 is closed .",
    "this implies we get a well - defined cohomology class denoted @xmath117 \\in h^2(x ; { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb z}}_2)$ ] .",
    "we can then conclude    an oriented vector bundle @xmath104 over @xmath19 admits a spin structure if and only if @xmath118 .",
    "the cohomology class @xmath119 is known as the _ second stiefel - whitney class _ of @xmath104 , the details of why @xmath115 defines a cohomology class can be found in @xcite p.180 . given an oriented 4- manifold @xmath19 its tangent bundle is an oriented vector bundle over @xmath19 of rank four .",
    "the second stiefel - whitney class of the tangent bundle associated to @xmath19 will be denoted by @xmath120 .    given a kirby diagram of the oriented 4-manifold @xmath19",
    "the following proposition shows how we can compute the second stiefel - whitney class @xmath120 .",
    "[ spin ] for an oriented manifold @xmath19 given by a kirby diagram in dotted circle notation , @xmath121 is represented by the cocycle @xmath122 whose value on each 2-handle @xmath109 is the framing coefficient of @xmath109 modulo 2 .",
    "the proof of this proposition can be found in @xcite proposition 5.7.1 and corollary 5.7.3 , p.185 - 186 .",
    "the reader who is unfamiliar with dotted circle notation can consult @xcite chap.5.6 , p.167 .",
    "we will just mention that one way to think of how the dotted circle method comes in to play is to recall that we can cancel any 1-handle in a kirby diagram by adding an appropriate 2-handle .",
    "thus , adding a 1-handle to a kirby diagram @xmath19 is the same as removing the cancelling 2-handle .",
    "the point is that the cocore of the 2-handle corresponds to an unknotted 2-disk in @xmath19 , obtained from a 2-disk in the boundary @xmath123 by pushing the interior of this 2-disk into the interior of @xmath19 . in this way we can think of the addition of a 1-handle as being done by pushing the interior of a 2-disk , originally in @xmath123 , into the interior of @xmath19 and then removing a tubular neighbourhood of the disk",
    "this tubular neighbourhood is drawn as a circle decorated with a dot , hence the name the dotted circle notation . using this viewpoint of",
    "a 1-handle one can transfer a usual kirby diagram into dotted circle notation . on the level of the actual diagram one can think of the passage to dotted circle notation as being carried out by choosing a collection of reference arcs , one for each pair of 1-handles running between the attaching spheres of the 1-handle , then taking a dotted meridian to each such reference arc and collapsing the associated 1-handle via the reference arc .",
    "this will cause the 2-handles running between the 1-handles to then run through the associated dotted meridian parallel to the choice of reference arc ( see @xcite p.169 ) .",
    "the problem here is that there is no canonical way to do this transformation , one has to make a choice of how the 1-handles are going to come together to form dotted circles i.e. one has to make a choice of reference arc .",
    "( see @xcite p.169 for an example of this choice ) .",
    "once one fixes a choice of such reference arcs then in dotted circle notation all the 2-handles are knots in 3-space .",
    "they then have a notion of a framing integer ( or as it is sometimes called framing coefficient ) .",
    "the goal of the rest of this section is to use proposition [ spin ] and show that the orientable double cover @xmath80 has vanishing second stiefel - whitney class . in order to use proposition [ spin ]",
    "we need to show how to transform the kirby diagram of @xmath80 into dotted circle notation .",
    "we start by showing how we can pick a system of reference arcs for each 1-handle such that when we change to dotted circle notation the framing of each 2-handle will be congruent to zero mod two . in order to do this",
    "we need a way to measure the framing from the diagram .",
    "a convenient choice to use is the * blackboard framing * , this involves projecting the knot onto a 2- plane giving a knot diagram .",
    "the framing coefficient is then computed as the signed number of self - crossings of the knot .",
    "start with the @xmath88 plane , the following diagram shows a system of reference arcs for some of the 1-handles , they all lie in the x - y plane and have framing zero .",
    "this leaves us with specifying reference arcs for the 1-handles @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the reference arcs for some of these will have to leave the @xmath88 plane slightly as some other handles are in the way .",
    "the following diagram shows these reference arcs together with the ones shown above .",
    "once we have chosen a particular reference arc for a 1-handle in one diagram we have to use that same reference arc for any other diagram that the 1-handle resides in .",
    "for example since the 1-handles @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 also lie in the @xmath89 plane when we choose reference arcs for 1-handles in the @xmath89 plane we have to keep in mind that the reference arcs for @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 have already been chosen .",
    "the following diagram shows the reference arcs for the 1-handles in the @xmath89 plane .",
    "the arcs you see , in the above diagram , running between the 1-handles @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 represent projections , of the reference arcs chosen previously for these 1-handles , onto the @xmath89 plane .",
    "the next reference arcs we want to show are for those 1-handles in the diagram corresponding to the twelve 2-handles not all lying in a single 2-plane . to start with we show those reference arcs that have already been chosen when we considered the @xmath88 and @xmath89 planes .",
    "we are left with choosing arcs for @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 . for the 1-handles @xmath128 and @xmath130 we choose horizontal arcs that run behind the diagram as the following shows .        for the 1-handles @xmath129 and @xmath131 we choose horizontal arcs running in the front as the following shows .",
    "the final case to consider is the diagram that shows the @xmath90 plane and the plane parallel to the @xmath90 plane . for this diagram",
    "we choose the following arcs .",
    "we have not shown how the arcs running between the 1-handles @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 look like from this plane . from our choice above it should be clear to the reader that they run horizontally outside the diagram .",
    "we claim that with this system of reference arcs when we pass to dotted circle notation each 2-handle will have even framing .",
    "this is not too hard to see , one needs to take each 2-handle separately and then see what happens when we collapse a 1-handle it goes over using the reference arc for that 1-handle .",
    "let us give a few examples .",
    "start with the 2-handles in the @xmath88 plane , look at the pink 2-handle in that plane .",
    "when we use our system of reference arcs to collapse the 1-handles it goes over we get that the pink 2-handle transforms to the following .        as we are only interested in the framings of each 2-handle and not on how they link with the other 2-handles we have thrown away some 2-handles so that the reader can easily see how the pink 2-handle will look like in dotted circle notation .",
    "it should be clear to the reader that the pink 2-handle transforms to a knot with zero framing ( remember we are using the blackboard framing ) .",
    "the green 2-handle also transforms in a similar way , the following diagram shows how it looks like .",
    "the reader should notice that the framing is again zero .",
    "the following diagram shows how the red and blue 2-handles transform",
    ". it should be clear that the framing is zero for both of them .",
    "one can continue in this fashion checking each 2-handle , in this case one finds that all the 2-handles will have framing zero .",
    "the point is that since these 2-handles are all confined in a 2-plane one can easily find a system of reference arcs so that in dotted circle notation these 2-handles will have even framing . a computation similar to the above works for the @xmath89 plane as well ,",
    "we leave the details to the reader .",
    "we want to move on to considering the diagram showing the twelve 2-handles that did not all lie in a single 2-plane .",
    "the following diagram shows how the green 2-handle in that diagram transforms .",
    "it is easy to see that the framing is again zero .",
    "so far all the 2-handles we have shown have had framing zero simply because when they transform they do nt cross over themselves .",
    "it can happen that a 2-handle transforms to something that has self crossings .",
    "however , it is always the case that the number of self crossings is even , this means that the blackboard framing will always be congruent to zero mod two .",
    "the following diagram shows how the black 2-handle transforms .",
    "in this case you can see two self crossings , and if we were to project this to the plane then we would have framing zero ( as we count the crossings with sign ) .",
    "each of the other 2-handles in this diagram transform in a similar way .",
    "it is also the case that for the 2-handles in the diagram showing the @xmath90 plane that when we transform to dotted circle notation , using the reference arcs we have chosen above , we always get 2-handles with an even number of self crossings . in other words",
    "they also all have an even framing . as",
    "the details are exactly analogous to what we have shown above we will not bother with the details .    in summary",
    "we have chosen a system of reference arcs that when used to transform the kirby diagram of @xmath80 into dotted circle notation we obtain 2-handles all of which have an even framing . in particular by proposition [ spin ] we see that the double cover of manifold 1011 must be spin .",
    "we already mentioned that d. ivan@xmath11i@xmath12 in @xcite proved that if you glue in a solid 3- torus to each cusp cross - section of @xmath80 you get a 4-manifold that is homeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "the gluing is done by choosing a meridian , then gluing via the identity map .",
    "the parabolic translations that corresponded to the @xmath70-fibre of each cusp cross - section of @xmath25 were @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath53 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "each of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath53 , and @xmath73 are orientation preserving isometries , hence they lift to the same isometries in the orientable double cover .",
    "this means we can take them as meridians in the orientable double cover . on the other hand @xmath74 lifts to @xmath132 in the orientable double cover . on the level of a handle decomposition the gluing in of a solid 3-torus corresponds to adding one 2-handle , two 3-handles , and one 4-handle",
    ". therefore on the level of the kirby diagram of @xmath80 the gluing in of solid 3-tori along the meridians given by @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath53 , @xmath73 , and @xmath132 corresponds to adding five 2-handles as follows .",
    "we need to add a 2-handle between @xmath133 and @xmath134 corresponding to gluing in a solid 3-torus via the identity along the meridian @xmath71 .",
    "we then need to add a 2-handle from @xmath135 to @xmath136 corresponding to gluing in a solid 3-torus via the identity along the meridian @xmath72 , and similarly for @xmath53 and @xmath73 .",
    "finally we add a 2-handle that has two components running from @xmath104 to @xmath95 and @xmath137 to @xmath138 respectively , corresponding to gluing in a solid 3-torus along @xmath132 .",
    "the kirby diagram of @xmath80 together with these five added 2-handles constitutes a kirby diagram for the filling of @xmath80 . using proposition [ spin ] and the system of reference arcs we chose above",
    ", it is easy to see that each time we glue in one of these solid 3-tori we still obtain a spin 4-manifold .",
    "this observation will be important in the next section when we construct certain finite covers of @xmath80 , and want to prove that their associated fillings are all spin .",
    "this section is devoted to constructing codimension two hyperbolic link complements in 4-manifolds that are homeomorphic to @xmath16 for @xmath27 .",
    "the candidate manifolds will be constructed by taking certain finite covers of manifold 1011 and then performing a filling of these covers .",
    "the homeomorphism type of these fillings will be analysed using the fact that the orientable double cover of manifold 1011 is spin ( see section [ spin_str ] ) coupled with an argument showing that the signature of these finite covers must vanish . as we will only be concerned with codimension two link complements , from here on in we",
    "will simply use the term link complement .",
    "recall we are denoting manifold 1011 by @xmath25 and its orientable double cover by @xmath80 .",
    "the manifold @xmath25 has five cusps with each cusp cross - section being given by the closed flat 3-manifold @xmath99 .",
    "the parabolic translations corresponding to the @xmath70-fibre of each of these cusp cross - sections are given by @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath53 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "when we construct a filling on the level of the fundamental group what we were doing is adding the relations @xmath139 ( see end of section [ double_cover ] ) .",
    "if instead we add a power of one of the translations then we can construct new fillings .",
    "for example instead of taking @xmath71 we could take @xmath140 for some @xmath141 .",
    "this is still a translation and so we can try and analyse what happens if we fill along this translation . on the level of the fundamental group",
    "what we are doing is adding the relations @xmath142 . using some computer software , such as * magma *",
    ", one can obtain that the presentation for the fundamental group with these added relations is @xmath143 .",
    "this is not quite a product as the @xmath144 and @xmath71 terms interact , however it is a semi direct product of @xmath145 , generated by @xmath71 , and @xmath101 , generated by @xmath144 , where @xmath144 acts on @xmath145 by @xmath146 .",
    "we can use this fact to construct finite covers of @xmath25 as follows .",
    "let @xmath147 be the quotient homomorphism given by the above discussion .",
    "we know explicit generators of each parabolic subgroup associated to each cusp of @xmath25 ( see section [ double_cover ] ) .",
    "using these explicit generators one can show that the parabolic subgroups associated to the equivalence class of ideal vertices @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 all map to the generator @xmath144 under @xmath152 .",
    "furthermore , the parabolic subgroup corresponding to the ideal vertex @xmath153 has one generator ( other than @xmath71 ) that maps to @xmath144 , since @xmath71 maps to @xmath71 it follows that the image of the parabolic subgroup corresponding to @xmath153 is the whole group @xmath154 .",
    "this means that the image of the parabolic subgroup associated to @xmath153 has index one , and the index of the image of all the other parabolic subgroups is @xmath155 . as the orientation reversing side pairing transformations of @xmath25 are @xmath144 and @xmath156 , it follows that under the quotient map they map to @xmath101 .",
    "this implies that the orientation preserving generators are sent to @xmath145 , which in turn implies that that orientable double cover of @xmath25 corresponds to the index two subgroup given by @xmath157 .",
    "we also know that the kernel of this quotient homomorphism is contained in @xmath157 and has index @xmath158 .",
    "it follows that the cover corresponding to @xmath159 is also an @xmath155-fold cover of the orientable double cover of @xmath25 .",
    "the associated deck transformation group to @xmath159 over the orientable double cover of @xmath25 is @xmath145 , which implies the @xmath158 fold cover is a cyclic cover .",
    "the above construction shows that the orientable double cover @xmath80 has an @xmath155 sheeted cyclic cover for each @xmath155 , or put another way @xmath25 has a @xmath158 sheeted cover for each @xmath155 , where the case @xmath160 corresponds to the orientable double cover @xmath80 .",
    "the orientable double cover @xmath80 has five cusps each having type @xmath98 , which is the 3-torus .",
    "the discussion above tells us how each boundary 3-torus corresponding to a parabolic subgroup lifts to each cover .",
    "the boundary component corresponding to the ideal vertex class @xmath153 lifts to one torus .",
    "this means that the covering restricted to this boundary torus is the usual @xmath155 fold covering of the 3-torus onto itself .",
    "all other boundary 3-tori each lift to @xmath155 copies of itself .",
    "in other words , the orientable double cover @xmath80 has an @xmath155 sheeted cyclic cover which has @xmath161 cusps , each given by a 3-torus .",
    "we denote these covers by @xmath162 .",
    "the question that arises at this point is can we identify any fillings of these cyclic covers ?",
    "observe that @xmath80 has euler characteristic @xmath15 ( as all the ratcliffe - tschantz manifolds have euler characteristic @xmath14 ) .",
    "therefore each such cyclic cover has euler characteristic @xmath158 . in the case",
    "that @xmath155 is odd we claim that we can identify the topological type of the associated filling .",
    "the argument proceeds as follows , from the previous section we know that @xmath80 is spin hence it induces a spin structure on each of its boundary 3-tori ( there are five in total ) .",
    "the three torus has exactly eight spin structures , seven of them are given by having one @xmath70-factor taking the bounding spin structure induced from @xmath163 , and each of these spin structures spin bounds a solid 3-torus .",
    "the eighth spin structure corresponds to taking the lie group spin structure on each @xmath70 factor .",
    "this eighth spin structure does not spin bound a solid 3-torus , rather it spins bounds the complement of a singular 2- torus fibre in @xmath164 , viewed as an elliptic fibration over @xmath165 ( see @xcite chap .",
    "when we preform a filling of @xmath80 we are gluing in a solid torus by making a choice of meridian . when we do this to each cusp cross - section the manifold we obtain is itself spin ( see discussion at end of section [ spin_str ] ) , meaning that the spin structure induced on each boundary 3-torus must cross over the solid torus that we glued in .",
    "hence the induced spin structure on each boundary component must be the one that spin bounds a solid torus , and in fact the fibre we are filling in must have the spin structure induced from @xmath163 .",
    "as four of the boundary 3-tori each lift to @xmath155 disjoint 3-tori in the cyclic cover .",
    "it follows that the spin structure associated to these @xmath155 boundary 3-tori in the cyclic cover must have the same spin structure as their base .",
    "thus we need only worry about the lift of the boundary 3-torus corresponding to the ideal vertex class @xmath153 . in this case the covering is given by the covering of @xmath166 onto itself induced by the @xmath155-fold cover of one @xmath70 factor onto itself . in the case that @xmath155 is odd we have that the lifted spin structure on the associated boundary 3-torus in the @xmath155 sheeted cover must also be the one that spin bounds a solid torus .",
    "this implies that for @xmath155 odd the associated filling of the @xmath155 sheeted cover is a closed smooth simply connected spin 4-manifold .",
    "we have thus proved the following theorem .",
    "the manifold @xmath80 has a collection of @xmath155-sheeted covers , denoted by @xmath162 , such that each @xmath162 has @xmath161 cusps with each cusp cross - section being the 3-torus .",
    "furthermore for @xmath155 odd a filling of @xmath162 produces a closed smooth simply connected spin 4-manifold .",

    "we now want to move on to describe the homeomorphism type of each of the fillings of the manifolds @xmath162 , in the case that @xmath141 and odd .",
