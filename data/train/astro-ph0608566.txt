    "when the wavelength of synchrotron radiation emitted by a bunch of relativistic particles is comparable to the size of the bunch the particles may radiate coherently .",
    "the coherent emission produces significantly greater power than the incoherent emission .",
    "coherent synchrotron emission is seen from different astrophysical source but most notably from the rotationally powered radio pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particle accelerators",
    "the coherent synchrotron emission is usually undesirable because it causes very rapid energy loss . in this context",
    "we would also like to mention efforts to study coherent curvature radiation as a pulsar emission mechanism in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "several effects may act to stabilize a system unstable to the csr instability . in @xcite",
    "the authors analyzed the influence of a small energy spread in a beam of charged particles in approximately circular motion . a distribution function with a single value of the canonical angular momentum",
    "was considered .",
    "the radial width of the beam was given by the amplitude of the betatron oscillations which is non - zero for a non - zero energy spread .",
    "it was shown that the decoherence introduced by the betatron oscillations leads to a characteristic frequency spectrum , whereas the dependence on the lorentz factor and the number density remains unaffected .    in this paper",
    "we relax the assumption of zero spread in the canonical angular momentum @xmath0 of the equilibrium distribution . in general",
    "this leads to shear in that the average angular velocity becomes dependent on the radius of the orbit . in practice",
    "the requirement of a small spread in the canonical angular momentum may be harder to satisfy than a small energy spread .",
    "shear is expected in astrophysical sources of coherent emission @xcite .",
    "shear itself can be the cause of instabilities , for example , the `` diocotron instability '' @xcite , but this is not the focus of the present paper . in the case of csr",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the shear acts to stabilize the csr instability due to particles with different radii `` slipping away '' . using a linear perturbation analysis of the fluid equations for a laminar brillioun flow we show that even with a spread of the canonical angular momentum @xmath1 , previous results for equilibria with constant @xmath2 can be recovered treating the plasma as a relativistic cold fluid .",
    "computer simulations of csr emission in brillioun flows @xcite are compatible with this picture . with the cold fluid approximation adopted here , the stability depends on the number density and the angular velocity which depends on the radius .",
    "the azimuthal velocity is approximately equal to the speed of light .",
    "the problem of csr emission has been investigated by several authors .",
    "goldreich and keeley @xcite considered the stability of a charge distribution whose motion is confined to a thin ring with the particle motion being one - dimensional .",
    "this calculation led to confusion as to how the proposed csr mechanism works in detail ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as proposed in @xcite the csr instability is related to the classical negative mass instability @xcite in the sense that an increase in particle energy leads to a decrease in its angular velocity .",
    "while the classical negative mass instability is caused by the coulomb part of the electromagnetic potential , the csr instability is caused by the radiation field .",
    "the negative mass effect is not immediately apparent in a one - dimensional treatment based on conservation of energy and charge .",
    "heifets and stupakov @xcite effectively built in the negative mass effect by hand having a constrained radius and particle energy .",
    "the treatments @xcite give the growth rate in the absence of an energy spread .",
    "however , considering a non - zero energy spread requires a truly two - dimensional model .",
    "larroche and pellat investigated the effect of steep boundaries in the particle distribution function @xcite .",
    "section ii describes the assumed models , and section iii approximate solutions of the equations .",
    "section iv derives a dispersion relation for the considered perturbation .",
    "section v discusses the results .",
    "we consider two cases illustrated in figure 1 . the first case ( a ) corresponds to a thin layer of relativistic electrons gyrating in a uniform external magnetic field , an `` e - layer . ''",
    "the second case ( b ) corresponds to the electrons moving almost parallel to a toroidal magnetic field .",
    "we consider a laminar brillioun type equilibrium of a long , non - neutral , cylindrical relativistic electron ( or positron ) layer in a uniform external magnetic field @xmath3 , where we use a non - rotating cylindrical @xmath4 coordinate system .",
    "the electron velocity is @xmath5 the self - magnetic field is in the @xmath6direction while the self - electric field is in the @xmath7direction .",
    "the radial force balance of the equilibrium is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the lorentz factor with velocities measured in units of the speed of light , @xmath10 is the total ( self plus external ) axial magnetic field , @xmath11 is the total ( @xmath12 self ) radial electric field , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the particle charge and rest mass .",
    "we have @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the charge density of the electron layer .",
    "we consider weak layers in the sense that the ` field reversal ' parameter @xmath17 is small compared with unity , @xmath18 . under this condition equation [ fbalance ]",
    "gives @xmath19 .",
    "here , we have assumed that the layer exists between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we also consider that the lorentz factor is appreciably larger than unity in the sense that @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , we consider radially thin layers @xmath23    we consider general electromagnetic perturbations of the electron layer with the perturbations proportional to @xmath24 where @xmath25 for the different scalar quantities , @xmath26 integer , and @xmath27 the angular frequency of the perturbation .",
    "thus the perturbations give rise to field components @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . the perturbed equation of motion is @xmath31 @xmath32 where the deltas indicate perturbation quantities .",
    "this equation can be simplified to give @xmath33 \\left[\\begin{array}{c } { \\delta v_r } \\\\ \\noalign{\\medskip}{\\delta v_\\phi } \\end{array}\\right]~\\ ] ] @xmath34~ , \\label{simpeuler}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the doppler shifted frequency seen by a particle rotating at @xmath37 .",
    "we also define the dimensionless quantity @xmath38 which will turn out to be useful later .",
    "using the equilibrium equation [ fbalance ] and the condition @xmath18 , the matrix in equation [ simpeuler ] is approximately @xmath39~,\\ ] ] we have used the fact that @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath18 we have @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in the absence of shear",

    "here we consider an equilibrium with the same number density and velocity profile as before but with different external fields as shown in figure [ config]b . instead of an external magnetic field in the @xmath6direction we consider an equilibrium with an azimuthal magnetic field acting as a guiding field and a radial electric field .",
    "the latter is included in the equilibrium condition and therefore does not enter the linearized euler equation .",
    "@xmath47 would only enter if we considered motion in the axial direction and non - zero axial wavenumbers .",
