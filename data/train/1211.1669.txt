    "the hot halos of spiral galaxies like our own are reservoirs of @xmath4k gas whose origin is unclear .",
    "these halos are potentially important to galaxy formation theories because some closed - box models of galactic chemical evolution predict a larger number of metal - poor stars in the solar neighborhood than we observe ( the g - dwarf or m - dwarf problem , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this issue is not isolated to the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". this problem can be solved by the accretion of low - metallicity gas onto the disk from the halo .",
    "in addition , @xcite argue that about @xmath5yr@xmath6 of accretion onto the disk is required to sustain the star formation rate ( sfr ) of typical spirals ; @xcite find that the sfr in the solar neighborhood has been nearly constant for the past 11gyr for a salpeter initial mass function , so star formation may indeed be sustained for long times .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the required accretion occurs primarily via condensation of a radiatively cooling hot halo or cold flows and minor mergers ( for a review of cold accretion , see * ? ? ?",
    "it is also unclear whether the hot halo is gas accreted from the local intergalactic medium ( igm ) as suggested by @xcite .",
    "instead , they may be gas expelled from the disk by supernovae ( sne ) in a `` galactic fountain '' @xcite",
    ". both can explain the observed hot halos : in the case of accretion , infalling gas from the igm shocks and is heated to the dynamical temperature , whereas a galactic fountain forms the hot halo as superbubbles powered by hundreds of sne break out of the galactic disk and vent their contents to the halo .",
    "since both the galactic fountain and accretion from the igm are expected to occur , it is not clear which contributes most to the hot halo .",
    "for example , if the supernova rate is too low , the bubbles may never break out or only contribute to a halo with a small scale height . as both mechanisms can produce a halo with a similar temperature and disk condensation rate ,",
    "the simplest way to distinguish them is the metallicity of the hot gas , which should be close to the igm value in the accretion scenario ( @xmath7 in a spiral - rich cluster such as hcg16 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and solar or super - solar in the fountain scenario .",
    "the hot halos are visible in the soft x - rays where the metallicity can be measured directly .",
    "since edge - on spirals allow for clean separation of the disk and halo emission while amplifying the surface brightness of the halo , they are the ideal candidates for this measurement .    in this paper",
    ", we present an x - ray study of the hot halo of ngc891 using _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data to measure the halo metallicity .",
    "ngc891 is a nearby ( @xmath8mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) edge - on spiral thought to be a close milky way analog in luminosity and spectral type ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and , as in our galaxy , there is dynamical evidence for a bar @xcite .",
    "ngc891 is not interacting with other galaxies , is almost perfectly edge - on , and has no optical or warp @xcite , allowing an unambiguous distinction between halo and disk emission .",
    "however , it is known to be slightly lopsided @xcite . the primary aim of our study is to measure the metallicity of the hot halo directly from the x - ray data .",
    "a summary of basic parameters for ngc891 is given in table  [ table.basic ] .",
    "ngc891 is of particular interest because it is the x - ray brightest of normal edge - on galaxies @xcite and has been held up as a prime example of a galactic fountain in action .",
    "the evidence in favor of such a fountain is quite strong , enabling us to determine whether the x - ray emitting gas is an important participant in the fountain or largely decoupled accreted material that slowly settles onto the disk .",
    "we review the evidence presently .",
    "first , the disk appears to be dynamically connected to the halo .",
    "the cold halo rotates differentially , with rotation velocity decreasing with distance from the disk @xcite , and the spatial structure of the radio emission correlates with that of the h@xmath9 halo @xcite and the x - rays @xcite , being concentrated in the north and near the disk .",
    "the sfr is also highest here , which @xcite argue leads naturally to the observed distribution since the amount of hot gas is proportional to the energy injected by supernovae .",
    "this is consistent with the dust halo @xcite , which shows more pronounced filaments on the northern side ( although perhaps just as many on the southern side ) , but we note that @xcite find that the extended molecular halo is consistent with being symmetric about the rotation axis .",
    "second , there is strong evidence for magnetic fields lacing the halo that are naturally explained by a galactic fountain .",
    "there is radio synchrotron emission cospatial with the halo out to 10kpc away from the disk @xcite , and there are collimated h@xmath9 filaments that extend a few kpc above the disk @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the magnetic field originates in the disk @xcite .    finally , clear evidence of supernova activity is visible in the disk .",
    "@xcite find superbubbles and shells near the midplane , as well as filamentary structures that appear to be connected to the disk superbubbles .",
    "these may signify breakouts from the disk where the hot medium can rise into the halo .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section.obs ]",
    ", we describe the x - ray observations of ngc891 and how we processed the resultant data .",
    "section  [ section.metallicity ] contains the temperatures and metallicities we derive from fits to the spectra , as well as estimates of the uncertainties in these parameters from various systematic effects .",
    "we present two competing models that can not be spectroscopically distinguished with the present data , so in the first part of section  [ section.discussion ] we appeal to the expected cooling rate and morphology of the hot halo in each model .",
    "afterward , we consider more generally whether the hot gas is coupled to the neutral halo and whether the system is in a steady state .",
    "we conclude by summarizing our results and arguments .",
    "we processed new and archival x - ray data from the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory and _ xmm - newton _ ( table  [ table.observations ] ) .",
    "our primary goal was to measure the metallicity of the hot halo , which is visible in the soft x - rays .",
    "to do so , we extract spectra from regions on the detectors corresponding to the halo and fit them with a thermal plasma model , assuming collisional ionization equilibrium . in the remainder of this section , we describe the observations and processing , surface brightness maps , and our spectral fitting method .",

    "the data were processed using the standard reduction tasks for the epic cameras in the scientific analysis system software ( sas v11.0 ) and screened for proton flaring , after which 92ks of good time remains . unlike the _ chandra _ images , this exposure is severely contaminated by the presence of a bright new source with an absorbed @xmath22kev flux of @xmath36ergs@xmath6 near the disk of the galaxy .",
    "this source , which we argue is an ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulx ) in ngc891 @xcite , was not present in the _ chandra _ observations nor any archival x - ray observation publicly available .",

    "we used a cutoff flux of @xmath37ergs@xmath6@xmath26 in the @xmath38kev bandpass .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ point source sensitivity for this exposure is about @xmath39ergs@xmath6@xmath26 in the pn and slightly worse in the mos detectors .",
    "when compared to the masks produced for the _ chandra _ data , we find good agreement near the central region except for the ulx , which we excise to the 90% encircled energy radius ( 1arcmin ) .",
    "we also note that chip 5 on the mos1 detector has anomalously high background and is removed from analysis ; however , no significant source emission falls on this chip .",
    "the diffuse emission associated with the hot halo can be seen in adaptively smoothed maps of the soft emission with point sources removed ( figure  [ figure.inner_outer_halo ] ; the large cavity on the right is the ulx mask , and the point source masks for each epic camera are shown in figure  [ figure.xmm_masks ] ) .",
    "the left panel shows the bright emission close to the disk seen by _",
    "chandra_. little emission comes from the disk itself ( where the soft x - rays from the ism are absorbed by the high @xmath40 column ) , and the emission immediately outside is dominated by the bulge near the galactic center .",
    "the non - bulge emission is primarily seen to the north of the galactic center and is concentrated within about 1.5kpc of the disk .",
    "this is the halo emission most obvious at lower sensitivities @xcite , and it correlates with the diffuse ionized ( h@xmath9 ) halo @xcite and higher sfr on the northern side . in the deeper _ xmm - newton _ image to the right , it is evident that the diffuse x - ray emission extends much farther from the bulge ( also described in the _ rosat _ observation in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is more symmetric on larger scales .",
    "the diffuse emission is much more evident in the _ xmm - newton _ image in figure  [ figure.inner_outer_halo ] due to the higher effective area of the telescope and the moderate angular resolution ( 6arcsec ) compared to _",
    "chandra _ ( 0.5arcsec ) .",
    "the difference between the emission on large and small scales means that it is possible that the physical properties of the emitting gas are also different . for fitting purposes",
    "it is also convenient to extract spectra from regions near the disk ( where the absorption is strong and variable , see figure  [ figure.hi_halo ] ) and regions where the dominant @xmath40 column is the galactic one .",
    "since @xmath40 is somewhat degenerate with @xmath41 and @xmath42 at ccd spectral resolution , the cleanest measurement of @xmath42 can be made in the latter case .",
    "we therefore divide the x - ray emission into two regions : the `` inner halo '' ( where absorption must be modeled explicitly ) and the `` outer halo '' ( where we use the galactic column only ) .",
    "the inner halo is defined as the region more than two optical scale heights above the disk midplane ( @xmath43pc in * ? ? ?",
    "* and we adopt 300pc ) but below where the absorbing column falls to half the galactic value of @xmath44@xmath26 @xcite , which is between 1.53kpc depending on position along the disk ( figure  [ figure.hi_halo ] ) .",
    "the inner boundary is chosen to exclude x - ray binary emission , as ism disk emission is negligible .",
    "the outer halo is simply the region above this ( where the galactic column dominates absorption ) out to where the source emission falls below the background .    in practice , defining the rotation axis of the galaxy as @xmath45 and the projected midplane axis as @xmath46 , the inner halo has boundaries @xmath47 ( 0.6kpc@xmath482.8kpc ) and the outer halo @xmath49 ( @xmath50kpc ) . for extraction purposes , we make boxes whose length in @xmath46 is the projected disk length ( 7arcmin or @xmath5115kpc ) .",
    "filamentary structure and signs of outflows are common in x - ray images of edge - on ( mostly starburst ) galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we searched for structure by making unsharp masks of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data and looking for overlap .",
    "although apparent filaments are visible in each dataset , there is little agreement between images . on closer inspection",
    ", the putative filaments often include emission near point source masks . because the psf wings produce enhanced surface brightness over the background while the mask itself is a decrement , filamentary structure can be mimicked when a subtracted source is near two ( intrinsically uncorrelated ) regions with higher surface brightness",
    ". we also find that several of the structures in the _ xmm - newton _ map include point sources that were too faint or distorted to be identified by the _ cheese _",
    "algorithm but are obvious in the _ chandra _ data .",
    "we find no evidence for outflow - like or filamentary structures in the data , but as the emission is integrated through the halo we can not rule it out .",
    "the outer halo is approximately symmetric about @xmath45 and @xmath46 and is best seen in the _ xmm - newton _ image ( figure  [ figure.inner_outer_halo ] ) , as the outer halo is about as wide as the _ chandra _ acis - s3 chip . to estimate the scale height",
    ", we use the exposure - corrected , point - source subtracted data in the @xmath35kev bandpass for _ chandra _ and @xmath29kev for _ xmm - newton_.    if circular annuli are used , a blind radial profile including the bulge emission in the _ chandra _ image yields a surface brightness scale height of @xmath512arcmin ( @xmath514kpc ) .",
    "the bulge and halo are separate components , with the bulge having a smaller scale height and larger surface brightness .",
    "this suggests a larger scale height for the halo .    as the halo may not be spherically symmetric , we can measure the profile in @xmath45 using regions parallel to the midplane of the galaxy ( similar to the approach used for the ngc891",
    "chandra _ data in * ? ? ?",
    "this profile is shown in figure  [ figure.midplane_profile ] .",
    "the image on top is the adaptively smoothed _",
    "chandra _ image , with the 6arcmin by 0.25arcmin boxes we used overlaid on the image .",
    "the mean surface brightness in each region is shown in the bottom panel , and is blindly corrected for the point source masks and other unexposed areas by scaling to the nominal area in each box .",
    "the _ chandra _ data are shown as the black boxes in the bottom panel of figure  [ figure.midplane_profile ] , and includes the bulge emission . to derive the scale height",
    ", we fit an exponential profile ( @xmath52 ) , finding @xmath53arcmin ( 1.3kpc ) for the _ chandra _ data .",
    "this is similar to that in @xcite based on their encircled light values , and somewhat smaller than the _ rosat _ value reported by @xcite .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ values are shown as red triangles in figure  [ figure.midplane_profile ] and result in a slightly larger @xmath54arcmin ( 2kpc ) . as these values are extracted in wider boxes ( 6arcmin by 0.5arcmin )",
    "because of the large point source masks , we expect a bias towards higher @xmath55 .",
    "on the other hand , the _ xmm - newton _ images mask most of the bulge emission ( under the ulx point source mask ) that is included in the _ chandra _ fit .",
    "since the spectrum of the bulge emission shows that it is clearly a different physical component ( which we expect to have a smaller scale height ) , the _ chandra _ value quoted above is probably too small .",
    "since the bulge emission is not entirely masked in the _ xmm - newton _ image , we can improve this value by ignoring a region within about an arcminute of the galactic center .",
    "we do this by extracting profiles in 3arcmin by 0.5arcmin north and south of the bulge in the _ xmm - newton _ data , seen as green diamonds and blue stars in figure  [ figure.midplane_profile ] respectively .",
    "the similarity between the values for the long boxes and the northern shorter boxes in figure  [ figure.midplane_profile ] shows that the correction is small , with the dominant component being the bright emission near the disk on the north side .",
    "the halo emission itself is asymmetric both north - to - south and east - to - west .",
    "the north ",
    "south asymmetry is well known and can be easily seen in figure  [ figure.midplane_profile ] where the boxes are centered on the galactic center .",
    "the east  west asymmetry can be seen in the horizontal dashed and dotted lines in figure  [ figure.midplane_profile ] , which represent a constant `` background '' in the fit to the _ chandra _ data . despite nearly identical scale heights on either side of the galaxy , the west side is decidedly brighter out to the extent of the s3 chip .",
    "emission in the wings of the psf of bright subtracted point sources can account for less than 20% of the discrepancy .",
    "a cluster of faint point sources can not be ruled out .    on the north side of the bulge",
    ", we find @xmath56arcmin ( 2kpc ) east of the galaxy and @xmath53arcmin ( 1.3kpc ) on the west side .",
    "in contrast , z the surface brightnesses obtained on the south side of the bulge indicate scale heights of @xmath57arcmin ( 3.2kpc ) east of the disk and @xmath58arcmin ( 3.9kpc ) to the west .",
    "the difference in these values suggests that the inner halo may be a separate physical component .    however , the scale height is very sensitive to the innermost surface brightness values .",
    "these values are the most affected by the point source masks ( which are more concentrated near the disk ) , the bulge , and the residual 10% of the ulx emission .",
    "the change in surface brightness across each extraction zone is also highest near the disk , so our blind correction to the nominal area increases the uncertainty in these bins far beyond the @xmath59 errors plotted in figure  [ figure.midplane_profile ] .    still , it is likely that the true scale height , at least in the outer halo , is even larger than the @xmath57arcmin found in the southern boxes in the _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "when we correct for the bulge and ulx by subtracting model profiles ( assuming a circular psf for the ulx and a circular model fit to the bulge in the _ chandra _ data ) , @xmath55 increases to near 1.0arcmin in the northern boxes ( where the inner halo is bright ) and 2.5arcmin in the southern boxes .",
    "this is because @xmath55 is highly sensitive to the mean surface brightness in the innermost bins , which is overestimated according to these corrections .",
    "overall , a scale height of @xmath60arcmin ( @xmath61kpc ) is likely in the outer halo .",
    "the density scale height is twice this value , or @xmath62kpc , which is consistent with @xcite considering they included all diffuse emission . in any case ,",
    "a scale height below 1arcmin is strongly disfavored .",
    "finally , we note that there is a patch of diffuse emission to the northwest of the galaxy with approximately a 12arcmin separation .",
    "this is visible in both the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data and the emission is centered near @xmath6302h21m32.2s , @xmath6442d25m12s . the emission is roughly circular with a radius of about 2arcmin , but it has some substructure with a brighter `` bar '' running roughly parallel to ngc891 .",
    "the emission is near the _ chandra _ point source cxosexsij022142.6 + 422654 ( which may also be 1axgj022139 + 4226 , a source identified as 0.5arcmin away but in an error circle of 1.1arcmin ) .",
    "we have not found any records in the literature of this source despite its appearance in the acis - i chips of the archival _ chandra _ data , and unfortunately the optical and ir data at this position is limited . in 2mass and",

    "the diffuse source emission is made up of two or more components : the bulge and ( inner / outer ) halo .",
    "we begin with the simplest case of a homogenous halo , but the inner and outer halo may be produced by a galactic fountain and igm accretion respectively , and so may have different properties .",
    "the halo has an x - ray spectrum that peaks near 0.6kev , whereas the hotter bulge has a spectrum peaking near 0.9kev ( figure  [ figure.chandra_spectra ] ) .",
    "the bulge emission is unimportant in the outer halo , but contributes near the disk . as we expect these to be thermal plasmas in collisional ionization equilibrium ,",

    "all fits incorporate the galactic absorption column of @xmath73@xmath26 @xcite in addition to variable absorption near the disk .",
    "the influence of these choices ( by comparison with alternatives ) is described in section  [ section.metallicity ] .",
    "the ulx in the _ xmm - newton _ data contributes approximately 55,000 counts in the pn and 17,000 in each mos camera in the @xmath22kev bandpass , peaking near 1kev .",
    "although we mask the ulx to the 90% encircled energy radius , even outside this it contributes thousands of counts .",
    "we adopt as a ulx model the best fitting simple model from @xcite : absorbed emission from a hot accretion disk .",
    "this model , tbabs*diskpbb , is an excellent fit to the ulx spectrum ( @xmath74/1170 d.o.f . for the combined mos and pn spectra ) .",
    "we freeze the model parameters to their best - fit values : @xmath75@xmath26 , @xmath76kev , and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is a free parameter and @xmath79 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this model is included in all our _ xmm - newton _ fits with the normalization allowed to vary , but we find that it reproduces the expected contribution of the ulx flux very well in annuli around the ulx .",
    "the ulx spectrum does vary slightly with radius because the psf is energy dependent .",
    "however , for the relevant energies , the expected difference is approximately 1% , which is smaller than the poisson uncertainty in the ulx flux in the source extraction regions .",
    "the x - ray background includes instrumental noise , particle backgrounds , the cosmic x - ray background , the contribution from the local bubble , and the hot galactic halo .",
    "the latter two are particularly important for our purposes because the galactic halo has a similar temperature ( @xmath80kev ) to that of ngc891 , and the local bubble contributes to the emission lines by which we determine the temperature of the source plasma .",
    "such emission is typically subtracted by using a scaled spectrum extracted from nearby source - free regions .",
    "however , the emission from ngc891 s halo covers most of the acis - s3 chip and the central chips of the mos detectors , and the true scale height of the halo is unknown .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ particle background also induces strong fluorescent lines ( the al and si k@xmath9 lines at 1.49kev and 1.75kev are the important lines in our fitting bandpass ) that are highly variable with position such that scaled background subtraction leaves large pcygni type profiles in the @xmath81kev range .",
    "thus , the background regions for the _ chandra _ data contain an unknown amount of source flux , while those for the mos detectors ( placed farther out ) do not directly subtract the instrumental background for the chip of interest .",

    "since the galactic halo has a temperature similar to the 1-t fit temperature ( @xmath186kev ) , it likewise can not produce a strong line without also producing a strong line , which is the same reason the 1-t model leaves this excess ( figure  [ figure.fountain_sim ] ) .",
    "it is probably not produced by solar wind charge exchange because , while we would expect charge exchange to produce a simple line , we expect charge exchange to produce other strong lines ( e.g. ) , and @xcite find that _ xmm - newton _ observations affected by charge exchange have line light curves that are uncorrelated with continuum curves .",

    "there are some apparent differences between the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ spectra ( figure  [ figure.halo_contours ] ) , but the differences are small in absolute terms and fall within the 3@xmath23 statistical error contours . since the metallicities in all three are small , if the calibration below 0.5kev is wrong , it is wrong in a similar way for all three spectra .",

    "the agreement in astrophysical background surface brightness and spectra between the rass and three instruments we use indicates that the soft shoulder is not likely to be due to inappropriate background subtraction , for example a higher - than - expected local bubble contribution .",
    "while fits to the instrumental backgrounds without constraints from rass do not constrain the local bubble emission well ( it drops sharply above 0.3kev ) , in a phenomenological sense it does not matter how we fit the background as long as it is appropriately `` subtracted '' in the explicit fits , and the agreement between the parameters ( figure  [ figure.bkgfit_bkgsub_contours ] ) indicates that it is .    on the modeling side , one might worry about our treatment of the photoelectric absorption , the relative abundance tables we use , the thermal model we use , and the ( non-)modeling of the possible excess .",
    "photoelectric absorption predominantly affects the softer x - rays , thus potentially biasing @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in our fits to the outer halo , we fix @xmath40 at the galactic value of @xmath116@xmath26 .",

    ", if the excess is real it may indicate an additional thermal component rather than a single line , so this change in temperature should be treated with caution .",
    "nonetheless , the line does not appear to change the overall metallicity much , as its presence or absence does not change the need to model the flux below 0.5kev . adding a line component does change the o / fe value , counterintuitively _ increasing _ the value because the temperature of the 1-t model is forced higher , increasing the emission in the fe l - shell lines . in the fit as reported in table  [ table.halo_fits ] , the low temperature requires a relatively higher fe abundance to produce these lines .",

    ", there is some reason to believe this might be true : early , low - resolution and low - signal x - ray spectra from galactic halos were fit by single - temperature models with low metallicity , but later fits incorporating foreground and background components relaxed the metallicity constraints and found a 1-t vs. 2-t ambiguity as we find in ngc891 .",
    "@xcite found that the x - ray spectra extracted from a sample of nearby , edge - on , star - forming galaxies could all be fit with the same 2-t model ( with different normalizations ) .",

    "if the true value is near the upper bound , then the fountain model is implicated , but a more sensitive observation could rule it out .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the 2-t model leaves little room for a separate warm - hot halo component .",
    "the coronal scale height may also distinguish between the 1-t and 2-t models .",
    "specifically , we can measure the scale height in each component of the models assuming hydrostatic equilibrium ( the `` observed '' scale height ) and ask whether the value is consistent with our expectations based on the cooling and equilibrating times . if the observed scale height is inconsistent with these times , the model may be unphysical .    in hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath243 , where @xmath28 is the scale height .",

    "spectra extracted along and above the disk at various positions indicate that the 1-t model atmosphere is isothermal , so these values should be approximately accurate . however , to verify these values we have measured the emission - weighted density as a function of @xmath12 in a set of five strips ( each 0.5arcmin high ) above and below the disk .",

    "it is possible that the surface brightness enhancement around the disk to the north ( between @xmath81kpc off the disk ) is this dense layer , but no corresponding layer is visible in the maps where the column density falls off monotonically .",
    "also , the north side of the bulge only has about 30% more mass than the south in this region .",
    "this corresponds to less than 1% of the total coronal mass .    the measured scale height in the 0.1kev component of the 2-t model appears to be inconsistent with what we would expect from gas actually rising at this temperature .",
    "a substantial amount of 0.1kev gas is also required above 3kpc in the 2-t fit , but even if we put the fountain model aside it is unlikely that this gas could have cooled from the hotter medium .",
    "this is because the 0.1kev material will cool below x - ray visibility long before the 0.25kev gas cools to 0.1kev .",
    "we might also expect to see filamentary structures in the x - ray maps if this were the case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we do not see any ( section  [ section.obs ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the 0.2kev plasma of the 1-t corona moves faster and cools more slowly and will equilibrate long before it cools .",
    "the 1-t model is also in better agreement with recent galactic fountain models such as @xcite and @xcite that find an accreted corona is required to dissipate the angular momentum of material ejected from the disk . in these models , 1020% of the total extraplanar gas mass must be accreted from the igm .",

    "these arguments depend primarily on temperature and are less sensitive to the details of the physical model .",
    "for example , 0.2kev plasma in a 1-t fountain model would still equilibrate before cooling .",

    "if the 2-t model were still disfavored , such results would point toward a more complex hot halo .",
    "it is also possible that the 2-t model represents a fountain@xmath84accretion scenario in which the hotter component ( whose metallicity is poorly constrained , but somewhat above the 0.1@xmath190 of the 1-t model ) represents accreted gas that has equilibrated at a different scale height than the cooler fountain gas .",
    "the simulated _ xmm - newton _ spectrum in figure  [ figure.fountain_sim ] would strongly constrain the metallicity in the 2-t model if the 1-t model has already been ruled out . in this case , the accretion component would dominate farther from the galaxy .",

    ", it is evident that the atomic component could not have cooled from the hot corona in the steady state .",
    "this is because the cold ( @xmath276k ) gas free falls back onto the disk ( in @xmath277myr ) at a rate of @xmath278yr@xmath6 , whereas the total cooling rate from the x - ray and uv emitting gas is @xmath279yr@xmath6",
    ". this rate could be as low as @xmath280yr@xmath6 in the 1-t accretion model if the only source of luminosity is cooling coronal gas . in this case , the instantaneous gas consumption rate by star formation @xcite is more than 4times higher than the accretion rate",
    ".    the halo components could exist in a steady state if the is not supplied by the hot gas , but rather rises into the halo via a ( primarily cold ) galactic fountain ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and variants ) .",
    "the viability of a cold fountain depends on its ability to expel enough gas and to keep it cold . in our view , if the fountain is powered by superbubble breakouts ( the most natural way to launch material more than 1kpc above the disk ) , it fails to meet both criteria as we argue below .",
    "this rules out a halo formed by the steady - state action of a galactic fountain , hot or cold .",

    "extrapolations from observed superbubbles also support @xmath313 of hot gas as a lower limit in large bubbles . if the hot masses inferred in smaller bubbles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are scaled up to bubbles of @xmath289pc , the masses are @xmath322 , and @xcite find in spectral fits to regions in ngc2403 that the ratio of hot gas to swept - up mass is 610% ( for our fiducial shell mass of @xmath323 , this is @xmath324 of hot material , assuming this ratio holds throughout the lifetime of a massive bubble ) .",
    "these considerations suggest a hot mass somewhere between @xmath325 , so for the sake of argument we take as a fiducial value the hot mass in a @xmath326pc bubble to be @xmath327 . this would give a filling factor @xmath328 in the bubble described above , but we emphasize that the hot mass and filling factor of the soft x - ray emission is poorly known in many bubbles .",
    "thus , at breakout our fiducial bubble ( table  [ table.fiducial ] ) launches @xmath308 of cold shell material towards the halo and contains @xmath309 of hot ( @xmath317k ) material whose thermal energy ( @xmath329erg ) is similar to or greater than the kinetic energy in the entire shell .",
    "the erupting shell material is therefore driven rapidly upwards even though it dominates the mass .",

    "the thermal energy of the hot gas is sufficient to raise about @xmath332 of cold material to @xmath239k , so it is energetically feasible for the hot gas to become the dominant component ( there is more than enough energy to merely evaporate the cold material by heating it to , say , @xmath333k ) .",
    "whether the hot component becomes dominant is unclear , since evaporation occurs via thermal conduction in a boundary layer around the fragments and most of the hot material would not participate . on the other hand",
    ", the fragments are rising into the hot bath of the extant halo .",
    "a significant unknown is the effect of magnetic fields , which could suppress conduction relative to the @xcite value if the fragments are wrapped in field lines , which are seen to be expelled along with the gas @xcite in at least one superbubble in ngc6946 .",
    "however , turbulence could mitigate this effect ( cf .",
    "galaxy clusters in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the bubble described by @xcite ,",
    "both the large - scale fields around the bubble and turbulent fields entrained in the hot plasma are uplifted .",
    "the speed of the hot gas flow is also important , since gas that is too fast shocks the cooler entrained gas instead of evaporating it @xcite .",
    "pure hydrodynamic models suggest that virtually all of the gas rises hot @xcite , but the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) to a scale height of @xmath51500pc in ngc891 @xcite may indicate that a substantial amount of material rises cold .",
    "the difference between pah features in the disk and halo suggests that the cool fountain gas does experience shocks as it rises , but that these do not heat the gas to x - ray emitting temperatures ( it is also possible the grain destruction time exceeds the flow time )",
    ".    the proportion of cold fragments to hot gas will decline with distance above the disk since some of the cold material that is not evaporated will fall back below 1kpc ( above which it would unambiguously be considered halo material ) .",
    "@xcite find that the fragments have upward velocities between @xmath331kms@xmath6 , and on the lower end these fragments will reach an apex below 1kpc .",
    "considering these factors , we suppose that less than half of the fountain material that makes it into the halo is cold .",
    "this amounts to a few@xmath334 of cold material injected into the halo per hole and a comparable mass of hot gas .",
    "thus , a galactic fountain powered by supernova feedback seems unlikely to be truly `` cold '' .",
    "more importantly , it is evident from these values that the proportion of cold and hot material in the fountain is a moot point in ngc891 because the fountain envisioned above does not expel enough mass to sustain the halo regardless of the temperature .",
    "this can also be seen in ngc6946 , whose holes we used to derive our values . for our fiducial values ,",
    "the total amount of gas that rises into the halo in ngc6946 is no more than @xmath5115% of the total extraplanar @xcite and coronal gas @xcite .",
    "even with optimistic assumptions about the true hole size and amount of kinetic energy involved , it is difficult to envision increasing the outflow mass by an order of magnitude without ejecting the entire swept - up shell mass of each contributing hole , which is impossible for isolated holes .",
    "the situation is even worse in ngc891 , which has a similar sfr to ngc6946 ( and therefore presumably about the same number of holes ) but four times more extraplanar .",
    "this problem is circumvented if the extraplanar gas spends more time in the halo than the lifetime of the progenitor bubble .",
    "the lifetime of the holes is limited by the slowing expansion velocity ( once it drops below the characteristic velocity in the surrounding gas , the bubble breaks up ) and interactions with neighboring bubbles ( converging flows from two expanding shells can promote star formation which will disrupt that part of the shell ) , and is perhaps 80myr @xcite .",
    "hot gas may reside in the halo longer than this , but we have already established that the halo can not have cooled from the x - ray emitting gas if it is in the steady state . the time spent in the halo by the cold gas is about twice the free - fall time , or @xmath335myr for the ejection speeds in @xcite . since the expulsion of cold mass from the bubble is a one - time event occurring at breakout , we expect the cold material launched into the halo to return to the disk within a bubble lifetime ( although it will not refill the hole since the galaxy rotates and the fountain material has angular momentum ; * ? ? ?",
    "additional hot material may leak out of the hole following the breakout , but for an isolated hole this will be subsequent stellar wind and sne material .",
    "the masses of these components is quite small ; even if we assume that the hot gas does not escape the blown - out bubble before evaporating additional material from the shell , the evaporated component described above was a small fraction of the total swept - up shell mass .",
    "thus , neither a classic nor a cold fountain seem capable of producing the extraplanar in ngc891 in the steady state at the current sfr .",
    "although our argument for ngc891 is largely circumstantial , we note that ngc6946 has a similar mass , sfr , and is disk - dominated like ngc891 with a comparable disk scale height .",
    "since stellar feedback must be tied closely to the sfr , there is no reason to expect a much higher hole rate in ngc891 .",
    "it is not clear if this imbalance occurs more generally .",
    "there are not many non - starburst galaxies with the x - ray , uv , h@xmath9 , , and radio continuum data required to establish an mass and cooling rate ( starbursts are not expected to be in equilibrium ) .",

    "* ) . however , among galaxies with relatively complete coverage , there are others that appear to fall into this category . as we have established , the halo of ngc6946 can not have been ejected by the observed holes unless the expelled mass rate is an order of magnitude larger , but it also can not have cooled from the hot corona ( which has a bolometric @xmath336ergs@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",

    ".    if the halo is not in the steady state , there are two basic possibilities for the origin of the extraplanar gas : cold accretion and prior outflows .",
    "cold accretion ( including the recycling of gas ripped out of a disk by galactic interaction ) can occur via the infall of intergalactic clouds or through tidal stripping and cannibalization of small satellite galaxies .",
    "the former is disfavored by the paucity of intergalactic ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the small amount of counter - rotating extraplanar in ngc891 @xcite .",
    "recent simulations also indicate that accretion of fresh material primarily occurs in the hot phase @xcite . while it is possible that a large reservoir of photoionized hydrogen resides outside the visible halo , this would require an extremely extended halo .",
    "the @xcite contour map extends down to @xmath30@xmath26 and monotonically declines from the center .",
    "the scale height suggests that the column drops below @xmath342@xmath26 within several kpc of the last contour . at this point",
    ", we would expect the to be photoionized .",
    "although the column density likely continues to drop beyond this , if we assume that the space around ngc891 is filled with a uniform column of @xmath342@xmath26 ( @xmath343kpc@xmath110 ) , it would take about @xmath333kpc@xmath344 to make up @xmath345 of ionized hydrogen .",
    "if we further assume that the photoionized halo is circular in projection and centered on ngc891 , the radius required is about 200kpc . replenishing the visible halo from such a reservoir can not explain the observed mass , and it is not clear that such a halo would rotate with the galaxy to such distances .",
    "a more plausible scenario is that the halo is made up of tidally stripped gas from a satellite galaxy and gas ripped out of the disk of ngc891 by the same interaction .",
    "however , there is no direct evidence of an interaction such as tidal streams , stellar shells , or a warped disk that would be particularly visible in an edge - on galaxy .",
    "the absence of these features and the kinematics of the extraplanar indicate that the time elapsed since the posited interaction is a few times the galactic rotation timescale of a few@xmath270yr . in this case , however , we would expect gas within a few tens of kpc to have fallen back onto the disk .",
    "there are a few candidates for recent interactions .",
    "first , the companion galaxy ugc1807 is a small but gas - rich galaxy with about 10% of the mass of ngc891 and is sufficiently far away to account for the lack of tidal features @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite find that the amount of accretion that can be explained by this interaction is only @xmath346yr@xmath6 .",
    "two other signatures of recent or ongoing accretion are described in @xcite , namely an extended ( 10kpc above the disk ) , flat ( disk - like ) envelope of halo stars and a giant rosette pattern of tidal streams extending out to 30kpc from ngc891 .",
    "we do not believe the former can account for much recent cold accretion because such extended `` disks '' form on long timescales of a few gyr or more when dwarf galaxies are cannibalized @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite also find a similar extended halo around ngc2683 , a highly inclined ( @xmath347 ) galaxy with a similar total mass to ngc891 but no substantial halo @xcite .",
    "such envelopes may be common , but evidently need not correlate with recent cold accretion .",
    "regarding the rosette tails , @xcite argue that they likely originate from a single accretion event based on the similar morphology to disrupted dwarf galaxies in @xmath348-body simulations .",
    "if the galaxy were gas - rich , it could provide a substantial cold accretion rate over a relatively long period of time , but @xcite argue based on stellar ages ( no stars younger than a few gyr were seen in the streams ) that the companion had little compared to ugc1807 . although the instantaneous cold accretion rate could be quite high upon absorption of a particular stream , we would expect an average accretion rate from a gas - poor dwarf with a pre - merger gas mass @xmath349 to be no more than @xmath350yr@xmath6 , considering that the lifetime of the stellar streams is between @xmath351gyr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is similar to the imputed contribution from ugc1807 of @xmath346yr@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the remaining possibility we consider is a prior hot outflow that cooled to form the halo .",
    "there are two basic models , including a vigorous fountain ( powered by higher star formation distributed throughout the disk ) or a nuclear wind .",
    "plausible cooling mechanisms that would produce the observed halo can be found for either case , but as winds are ubiquitous in starburst galaxies @xcite , it may be that a powerful fountain is always accompanied by a nuclear wind .    typical outflow rates in winds appear to be @xmath352 times the instantaneous sfr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it is unclear how much mass they carry because the mass carried in each component is hard to measure ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if material flowed out of the disk at @xmath353yr@xmath6 , this would imply a sfr of @xmath354yr@xmath6 during the active phase , which is plausible for massive starbursts .    as the putative outflow must have occurred long enough ago for",
    "the to have cooled from the hot phase , a variety of parameters are possible .",
    "the minimum age of the outflow can be constrained by the cooling time of the gas and ( in the case of the wind ) the fallback time from large distances . in either case ,",
    "ages of 50myr or more are expected .",
    "the absence of wind signatures ( cf .",
    "edge - on starburst galaxies in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the duration of starburst episodes place lower limits consistent with this value .",
    "thus , it is neither possible to rule this out nor to make verifiable predictions , so what follows is speculation .",
    "ngc891 belongs to a class of massive , disk - dominated , late - type galaxies with relatively high disk - distributed sfr that are not classified as starbursts .",
    "nearby examples include ngc6946 , ngc2403 , m101 , ngc4631 ( although it is classified as a starburst by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ngc5775 ( classified as a starburst in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . of these ,",
    "ngc4631 and ngc5775 show some evidence for a wind - like nuclear outflow in the x - rays , with the case being stronger in ngc4631 .",
    "as one might expect , such galaxies tend to have more prominent halos than other massive spirals with lower sfr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with an active fountain implicated as a result .",
    "the existence of halos that appear too massive to have cooled in the steady state in ngc891 , ngc6946 , m101 , and ngc2403 ( more precisely , the x - ray cooling rate and expected cold outflow appears unable to replace gas lost via free - fall ) suggests that ngc891 may simply be an extreme case of a more frequent phenomenon , and that prior outflows may also be necessary in these galaxies .",
    "the case of ngc2403 is especially interesting in this vein because a _ chandra _ observation shows x - ray emission that is more centrally concentrated than the star - forming regions @xcite . since ngc2403 has a relatively high sfr ( @xmath355yr@xmath6 ) for its mass ( @xmath356 ) and the x - ray emission ( if produced by star formation )",
    "represents a significant amount of mass , ngc2403 may have had a nuclear starburst that has propagated outwards or shut off while the disk star formation continued @xcite .",
    "another hint of a prior outflow is found in m104 , which has a curiously low sfr for its mass , where @xcite argue that a nuclear wind ( in their model powered by type 1a sne ) has removed much of the material in the inner region of the galaxy , an argument supported by the absence of in the same region @xcite .",
    "we therefore speculate that the high sfr is the remainder of a starburst phase that ejected a substantial amount of material or else fresh star formation fueled by the return of this material to the disk .",
    "this scenario is attractive because it explains the evidence that points towards a vigorous ongoing disk ",
    "halo interaction ( summarized in section  [ section.introduction ] for ngc891 ) , the apparent disconnect between the and x - ray halos ( and perhaps the low metallicity of the latter , if it is accreted ) , and why starbursts generally do not have extended hydrostatic x - ray halos or prominent extraplanar ( although the latter may be due to photoionization of extant hydrogen ) . this appears to be true in ngc253 , ngc3628 , ngc3079 , and the less massive ngc4945 , ngc1482 , and m82 , where outflow morphology is seen in the x - rays @xcite and other bands , but only modest signs of extraplanar @xcite .",
    "the outflow rates required to explain the halos are easily met in starbursts . on the other hand , if the halos develop as hot gas cools , we would expect to see x - ray luminous post - starburst galaxies .",
    "this seems likely even if much of the halo is formed by recombination of extant photoionized gas in the wake of the starburst ( cf . the starburst galaxy ngc253 where the disk is smaller than the optical disk ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the sample of nearby massive spirals with x - ray observations is small , ngc891 is the most x - ray luminous of the nearby non - starburst spiral galaxies .    in principle , this picture is consistent with either the 1-t or 2-t coronal models depending on the type of outflow .",
    "it is possible that the observed corona is dominated by accreted material that has fallen in during and since the formation of the halo .",
    "such a situation could arise in an outflow scenario if a distributed starburst ( i.e. , non - nuclear ) `` fountain '' expelled a large amount of material ( @xmath357 ) in a relatively short period of time ( a few tens of myr ) . if the material was expelled via superbubble breakouts at a constant rate and entered the halo at several million degrees , the initial material would equilibrate before the end of the starburst and begin to cool .",
    "although its cooling time would be quite high at first , the scale height of the corona would be determined by the temperature , so additional fountain action would increase the coronal density ( and luminosity ) , thereby decreasing the cooling time . as more material accumulated in the halo , the cooling time would eventually shrink until the cooling rate was comparable to the fallback time of cold material , and the coronal gas would rapidly cool to form a large halo . if there were steady accretion from the igm throughout this period , the hotter material further out would survive the rapid cooling phase , leaving the halo possibly dominated by accreted gas . whether this would actually happen depends on the fountain ejection rate , the temperature , and the details of the cooling .",
    "for example , clouds may primarily form via the thermal instability , and the putative `` cooling flow '' would form the most cold gas nearest the disk , so the halo might not extend more than a few kpc from the disk .",
    "more importantly , it is not clear that such powerful distributed `` starbursts '' occur . on the other hand ,",
    "it is easier to explain such an outflow in the 2-t model of the halo ( if the 0.25kev component has near solar metallicity and the 0.1kev component represents the present - day fountain ) .",
    "overall , the hypothesis of a previous outflow is severely hampered by the dearth of meaningful constraints , but the present - day fountain and cold accretion do not seem sufficient to explain the massive halo in a steady state .      we have argued that the massive halo in ngc891 ( and , we speculate , in a handful of other nearby galaxies with sufficient data ) can not be supported by the instantaneous sfr or cooling from the x - ray halo .",
    "however , a rigorous examination of the fountain models and halo masses must be made in order to confirm this picture .",
    "for example , it is possible that the interaction between multiple breakouts within a small patch of the disk @xcite might conspire to eject much more mass , or that new bubbles forming below the falling back fragments of old ones can lift much more cold material than the breakout of a bubble from a pristine disk .",
    "our arguments are based on the latter scenario as it appears in maps of holes that the overlap fraction is small , but this may be a bias of the hole detection algorithm .",
    "an additional and important unknown is the amount of warm - hot material in the halos of various galaxies , although we would expect a separate warm - hot component to equilibrate with a small scale height . in ngc891 , at least , such a component could not explain the substantial extraplanar a few kpc away from the disk . finally , we emphasize that any galaxy with a low luminosity ( @xmath358ergs@xmath6 ) x - ray halo ( including many nearby massive spirals ) must have a low cooling rate of @xmath359yr@xmath6 , with @xmath360yr@xmath6 for a temperature like that of the galactic halo .",
    "even if the fountain model can be reconciled with ngc6946 @xcite , ngc891 has a halo four times more massive with a similar instantaneous sfr .",
    "the mass loading would then need to be a factor of @xmath361 in order to balance the fallback rate of the extraplanar .",
    "if the within 1kpc of the disk ( but outside a few scale heights ) is also participating in the fountain , the mass loading factor must exceed about 10 ( this may be material that was not ejected with sufficient velocity to exceed 1kpc ) .",
    "it is difficult to envision any fountain scenario in which this could be the case .",
    "since cold accretion does not appear to be a viable source of , we speculate that a prior outflow is the best explanation .",
    "unfortunately , there are few constraints on the characteristics of such an outflow , so it is an unsatisfactory , if plausible , explanation at present .",
    "however , if the present activity in the disk is insufficient to produce the neutral halo , it is the best candidate .",
    "finally , if it is conclusively demonstrated that the x - ray emitting gas is indeed low metallicity , a prior outflow scheme would decouple it from the observed halo ( that presumably has the same metallicity of the disk ) .",
    "we have used deep x - ray exposures of the nearby , edge - on spiral galaxy ngc891 to determine the properties of its hot halo .",
    "our main findings are summarized here :    * the hot halo is fit well by a thermal model with subsolar metallicity ( @xmath208 ) to high confidence",
    ". fits to the halo emission near the disk and farther out find nearly identical parameters , indicating a homogenous halo .",
    "* the simplest explanation for a low - metallicity x - ray halo is hot accretion from the igm . *",
    "the best - fit values agree between the mos , pn , and _",
    "acis - s detectors .",
    "an examination of the x - ray background in the region indicates that it is properly subtracted from the spectra , and known systematic effects from model choices and fitting method do not substantially change our results . *",
    "a 2-t model with solar metallicity is also a good fit to the halo spectrum when the emission measure is dominated by an absorbed , cool , @xmath209kev component .",
    "most of the emission , however , comes from a weaker @xmath177kev component .",
    "the metallicity in this model supports a disk origin for the coronal material .",
    "* when considering the x - ray cooling rate and limits on the cooling mass as well as the density scale heights in the 1-t and 2-t models , the 1-t model is favored .",
    "* the aforementioned cooling rates are not high enough to offset the losses of the massive halo due to fallback of cold material onto the disk .",
    "this suggests that the extraplanar gas can not be in equilibrium . *",
    "an examination of single superbubble breakouts indicates that a galactic fountain can not lift enough material into the halo to account for the massive halo .",
    "this corroborates the cooling rate problem .",
    "* there is no plausible cold accretion mechanism to supply so much gas so rapidly to ngc891 , so we speculate that a prior outflow has taken place .",
    "there is circumstantial evidence for some kind of past nuclear starburst in a few other massive , late - type galaxies with high star formation spread throughout the disk .",
    "however , the parameters of such an outflow can not be constrained from the present data .",
    "1-t and 2-t models of hot halos have been criticized as undermodeling the true spectrum , which may be considerably more complex @xcite . however , there is reason to believe ( at least in non - starburst galaxies ) that the halo really is simple .",
    "although we have presented arguments in favor of the reality of the low @xmath42 in the 1-t model and that the 1-t model better explains the coronal morphology , a definitive test could be made with a deep ( 400ks total ) exposure that would allow line ratios to be measured even at the low spectral resolution of the epic ccds .",
    "we believe that we have demonstrated that the background is well enough understood and the temperature well enough established to make this test feasible .",
    "in addition , such an exposure would allow a definitive study of the smoothness of the halo .",
    "coronal material is frequently described as `` filamentary '' in the literature , but in many cases the appearance of filaments may be biased by adaptive smoothing or related to psf wings . in our _ xmm - newton _ images of ngc891 , some apparent filamentary structure is revealed to be slightly brighter regions of the halo connected by dim point sources ( seen in the _ chandra _ data ) or arcs that clearly trace the edge of a subtracted point source mask . since the presence of this filamentary structure is an important test of state - of - the - art cooling models for accreted or hydrostatic halos ( e.g.",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a deep search for filaments that are not obviously related to outbursts ( as in starburst galaxies ) would be a welcome contribution .",
    "progress on the steady - state front requires a more sophisticated treatment of the galactic fountain mechanism , allowing for the action of interacting superbubble breakouts and superbubbles that form beneath debris falling back from prior breakouts .",
    "if it still appears that the instantaneous sfr in ngc891 and its high sfr counterparts can not explain the amount of extraplanar gas , a serious search for a sequence of post - starburst galaxies with luminous x - ray halos is warranted . improved imaging from the halogas project @xcite will refine the estimates of residing above 1kpc in nearby galaxies , but unfortunately x - ray imaging remains sparse .",
    "still , the work by @xcite and @xcite indicates that most galaxies will not have x - ray halos nearly as luminous as ngc891 .",
    "this in turn places cooling rate limits of about @xmath5yr@xmath6 on the halos of these galaxies , assuming a single - temperature plasma in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
