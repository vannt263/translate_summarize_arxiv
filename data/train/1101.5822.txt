    "a hypothesis that bears testing with these data is that the x - ray emission results from ic - cmb photons off relativistic electrons and that the bulk motion of the jet is highly relativistic and aligned close to the line of sight .",
    "we have several lines of evidence that suggest that the jets in our sample are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "we detected 12 x - ray emitting jets among the 19 targets observed , half of which were previously reported .",
    "of these detections , 9 were in the a subsample of 10 sources , while only 3 were in just the b subsample : 0234@xmath15285 , 2007@xmath15777 , and 2123@xmath5463 .",
    "if detections were equally likely in both b and a samples , then the _ a priori _ probability that there would be @xmath30 b detections would be 7.3% , so the hypothesis that the morphology selection is just as good as a flux selection is marginally acceptable .",
    "of the aggregate of 39 sources from paper i and this paper , 22 were in the a subsample .",
    "jets were detected in 16 of the 22 images , for a 73% detection rate .",
    "this detection rate is similar to that obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the jet detection rate for the b - only subsample is not as high .",
    "of all the b - only quasars , 7 of 17 jets are detected ( 41% ) .",
    "these rates could be biased , however , because those targets observed in other programs were generally the brightest a targets .",
    "the typical x - ray flux densities of detected jets are greater than 2 njy .",
    "flux densities in the radio band were generally lower in b targets than in a targets while the x - ray flux limits are all about the same ; consequently , the lower limits on @xmath0 are higher for the a targets ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : alpharx - z ] ) . however , fig .",
    "[ fig : arxdistribution ] shows that the distribution of @xmath0 is slightly shifted toward lower values of @xmath0 for b targets compared to a targets , indicating slightly larger x - ray flux densities relative to the jets radio flux densities as a group .",
    "thus , it appears that morphological selection may yield jets brighter in the x - ray band .",
    "however , the distribution differences are not statistically significant , due to small number of detected sources in the b subsample .",
    "furthermore , due to the systematically higher redshifts of the b subsample , jet detection rate differences between the two subsamples may result from redshift dependences .        as in paper",
    "i , there are bright x - ray jets even in sources with weak extended radio flux , confirming that the ratio of the x - ray to radio flux densities has a wide range ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : arxdistribution ] ) .",
    "the @xmath31 width of the @xmath0 distribution is about 0.15  a factor of 15 in @xmath32 , the ratio of the x - ray and radio flux densities ( as extrapolated to a common frequency , see appendix  [ app : d95 ] ) .",
    "the jets radio flux densities extend over a factor of almost 100 for the _ detected _ jets in our sample .",
    "while there is a general trend that the brightest jets are detected most often , it is clear that predicting the x - ray flux from the radio knot flux densities is risky , so a shallow survey is practically the only efficient means for finding jets that are x - ray bright .",
    "we note that the two jets detected out of four exposures longer than 10 ks would have been detected with just the first 10 ks .    whereas detailed individual analyses of the brighter quasar jets can test physical models ( e.g. ,",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we explore here how even relatively short exposures can prove useful for statistical tests of the model in which the x - rays result from inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by relativistic electrons in a jet moving with high bulk lorentz factor nearly along the line of sight ( the ic - cmb model ) .",
    "particular support for this model arises in individual cases where the optical flux lies below the radio to x - ray interpolation , indicating that synchrotron radiation from a single population of relativistic electrons can not fit the spectral energy distribution .",
    "we note that our objective is comparable to that examined by @xcite and @xcite but with a larger , more homogeneous sample of fr ii quasars containing a much larger fraction of sources with @xmath33 .",
    "we limit our analysis to the 34 quasars in our sample with known redshifts greater than 0.1 so as to avoid the slight contamination by flat spectrum , core - dominated fr i radio galaxies .    following ( * ? ? ?",

    "this paper is concerned primarily with shallow observations and deeper individual analyses would be best suited to examine these more subtle issues .      as in paper i , we computed the distribution of angles to the line of sight for these kpc scale jets , under the assumptions that 1 ) x - rays arise from the ic - cmb mechanism , and 2 ) all jets have a common lorentz factor , @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite estimated the intrinsic lorentz factor distribution for a flux - selected set of core - dominated quasars , finding that it appears broad , with most values of @xmath4 between 5 and 25 ( see their fig .",
    "9 ) . for now , we assume @xmath81 and find that @xmath37 ranges from 6  to 13  for the quasars in our sample ( see table  [ tab : beaming ] ) . for these sources , the doppler factor , @xmath82 ,",
    "is in the range 3 - 8 , compared to the assumed lorentz factor of 15 .",
    "because the jet surface brightness is not constant and the spatial variations between the radio and x - ray bands can differ , it is possible that systematic errors result from considering the entire jet . to estimate the effect of restricting attention to knots within the jets , we have computed x - ray and radio flux densities for a selection of 3@xmath833  regions from the jets .",
    "measurements are given in table  [ tab : knotresults ] and angles to the line of sight are given in table  [ tab : knotbeaming ] .",
    "the angles usually decrease by a degree or less from the full - jet estimates . for the remainder of this section",
    ", we will only consider results for the entire jet , leaving analysis of individual knots to follow - up work which will require deeper x - ray observations with higher knot counts .",
    "see section  [ sec : sources ] for comments about individual sources and references to more detailed analyses , where available .",
    "many of these sources are in the mojave program , which consists of vlbi observations of several hundred compact active galaxies and quasars used to measure pc - scale proper motions . of the 22 sources in common with our sample , we have x - ray data for 14 , as listed in table  [ tab : bends ] . for all but one quasar of the 22 , there is apparent superluminal motion .",
    "values of @xmath84 , the apparent velocity of the most rapidly moving pc - scale component relative to @xmath27 , are given in the table .",
    "see the discussion of individual sources for references .",
    "the population modeling by @xcite based on the mojave sample provides a basis for testing the ic - cmb model for our sample .",
    "as a first step , it is important to determine that our sample is a representative subset of the mojave sample . for the flux - limited mojave sample",
    ", @xcite showed that @xmath85 of the pc - scale jets are generally within 50% of @xmath86 .",
    "[ fig : sldistribution ] shows that the distribution of @xmath86 for our sample is as concentrated below about 5  as the mojave sample . also shown in this figure",
    "is the distribution of the values of @xmath37 for the large scale jets , as derived from the ic - cmb model .",
    "these angles are generally below 11  but systematically larger than the angles estimated for the pc - scale jets .",
    "this difference is not surprising because the pc - scale and kpc - scale jets are not aligned in projection on the sky but suggests that most misalignments are small .",
    "position angle differences are given in table  [ tab : bends ] .",
    "we now attempt to quantify the comparison of the angles to the line of sight for the kpc - scale jets with information in the pc - scale jets . in appendix  [ app :",
    "angle ] , we show how one may estimate the range of kpc - scale angles to the line of sight by using only the values of @xmath84 for the pc - scale jets and the position angle differences . at the same time ,",
    "intrinsic bend angles , @xmath87 , are estimated and a probable range for these angles are computed .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : bends ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angles ] , where it can be seen that these independent estimates are generally consistent .",
    "however , there are some notable exceptions , particularly where the angles from the ic - cmb calculation are of order a factor of two larger than those based on geometry and superluminal motion of the pc - scale jet . for these exceptions",
    ", one may infer that the jets decelerate substantially from pc to kpc scales .",
    "we have reported new imaging results using the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory for quasar jets selected from the sample originally defined by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) . for the larger sample ,",
    "we confirm many results in paper i : 1 ) quasar jets can be readily detected in x - rays using short _ chandra _ observations , 2 ) no x - ray counterjets are detected , and 3 ) the line - of - sight angles of the kpc - scale jets are small in the ic - cmb model in which the x - ray emission results from inverse compton upscattering of cosmic microwave background photons by relativistic electrons in a jet moving with large bulk lorentz factor .",
    "in addition , we have several new results : 1 ) depending on how the jet volume is computed , which determines how estimates of the intrinsic magnetic field may vary with @xmath3 , @xmath88 values do not increase with @xmath89 at the level expected in a simple ic - cmb model , and 2 ) the pc - scale jet speed and orientation indicate that some kpc - scale jets are oriented closer to the line of sight than inferred from the ic - cmb model , suggesting instead that these jets decelerate from pc to kpc scales .",
    "other results also cast doubt upon a pure ic - cmb interpretation of the x - ray emission from kpc - scale jets @xcite , tending toward an interpretation requiring a high energy population of electrons producing synchrotron emission observable in the optical to x - ray bands but undetected in the radio band . while we may not be able to verify this interpretation using these short x - ray exposures , our results",
    "do indicate that the large scale jets are likely to be seen in projection at small angles to the line of sight , as assumed in the ic - cmb model . in this case , in order to _ avoid _ substantial inverse compton emission , the kpc - scale jets must have smaller lorentz factors than their pc - scale counterparts .",
    "here we give the formal method for handling a linear regression where some of the data points have such large error bars that a logarithmic transformation is mathematically disallowed .",
    "one approach for handling such data is to degrade the poor measurements by assigning limits to them and then using a regression method developed by @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to use the error bars and distinguish between the observation and the intrinsic quantities .",
    "a regression method using all error bar information was presented by @xcite that we shall use here .",
    "see that paper for a discussion of the approach .",
    "our objective is to determine @xmath68 in the model    @xmath90    where @xmath91 .",
    "the data set is @xmath92 , where @xmath93 are the estimated luminosity ratios that have uncertainties @xmath94 that may be large .",
    "note that some @xmath93 values may be negative due to large background and low intrinsic @xmath32 values .",
    "following @xcite , we define the probability model for the true @xmath32 , when given @xmath95 and the model parameters as    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the standard deviation of the population about the trend line we are fitting .",
    "the likelihood for the observed values , given this model and the ( gaussian ) uncertainties on the measurements is    @xmath98    so that the minimization statistic that is distributed as @xmath99 is @xmath100 .",
    "the integration interval is set by the physical condition that @xmath32 can not truly be less than zero .",
    "we have used the formalism of ( * ? ? ? * hk02 ) in equation  [ eq : r ] .",
    "we could just as well have used the derivation by ( * ? ? ?",
    "we now show that these two approaches yield the same dependence of @xmath32 upon @xmath17 , @xmath43 , and @xmath3 .",
    "much of the reconciliation comes in the definition of terms . translating from d95 s notation to hk02 terms",

    "d95 s equations 7 and 8 define the ic - cmb flux , @xmath109 , and the synchrotron flux , @xmath110 , so taking the ratio gives    @xmath111^{1+\\alpha } ( \\epsilon_b/\\epsilon^*)^{1-\\alpha}\\ ] ]    in d95 notation , where @xmath112 is the monochromatic , isotropic , radiation density in the host galaxy s rest frame ; @xmath113 is the magnetic field energy density in the knot rest frame ; @xmath114 for @xmath115 g ; and @xmath116 is a dimensionless form of the photon energy of the isotropic radiation in the host rest frame .",

    "<S> depending on how the jet magnetic fields vary with @xmath3 , the observed x - ray to radio flux ratios do not follow the redshift dependence expected from the ic - cmb model . for a subset of our sample with known superluminal motion based on vlbi observations </S>",

    "<S> these angles are sometimes much smaller than estimates based on the ic - cmb model with a lorentz factor of 15 , indicating that these jets may decelerate significantly from pc scales to kpc scales . </S>"
