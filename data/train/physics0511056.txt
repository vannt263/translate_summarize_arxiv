    "hagen  poiseuille flow ( or simply poiseuille flow ) is important to a variety of applications ranging from macroscopic pipes in chemical plants to the flow of blood in veins .",
    "however , the rapid development in the field of lab - on - a - chip systems during the past decade has put even more emphasis on pressure driven laminar flow . traditionally , capillary tubes would have circular cross - sections , but today microfabricated channels come with a variety of shapes depending on the fabrication technique in use .",
    "the list of examples includes rectangular channels obtained by hot embossing in polymer wafers , semi - circular channels in isotropically etched surfaces , triangular channels in koh - etched silicon crystals , gaussian - shaped channels in laser - ablated polymer films , and elliptic channels in stretched pdms devices , see e.g. ref .  .",
    "this development has naturally led to more emphasis on theoretical studies of shape - dependence in microfluidic channels .",
    "recently , we therefore revisited the problem of poiseuille flow and its shape dependence and we have also addressed mass diffusion in microchannels  @xcite . in the present work we combine the two former studies and address the dynamics caused by the abrupt onset of a pressure gradient at time @xmath12 in an incompressible liquid of viscosity @xmath13 and density @xmath14 situated in a long , straight , and rigid channel of length @xmath15 and some constant cross - sectional shape @xmath16 .",
    "the solution is well - known for the case of a cylindrical channel , see e.g. ref .  , but in this paper we generalize the results to a cross - section of arbitrary shape .",
    "the similarity between mass and momentum diffusion , and the existence of a characteristic diffusion time - scale @xmath17 for mass diffusion  @xcite have led us to introduce the momentum diffusion time - scale @xmath11 defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the kinematic viscosity ( having dimensions of a diffusion constant ) , while @xmath1 and @xmath2 is the area and perimeter of the cross section @xmath16 , respectively . in this paper",
    "we show that the dynamics of the flow rate @xmath10 is universal with @xmath11 as the characteristic time scale .    as shown in ref .",
    "the shape parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 also play an important role in the steady - state poiseuille flow .",
    "the hydraulic resistance @xmath20 can be expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath8 is a dimensionless geometrical correction factor and @xmath22 is a characteristic resistance .",
    "remarkably , @xmath8 is simply ( linearly ) related to the dimensionless compactness parameter @xmath9 .    above",
    "we have emphasized microfluidic flows because of the variety of shapes frequently encountered in lab - on - a - chip systems .",
    "however , our results are generally valid for laminar flows at any length scale .",
    "we consider a long , straight channel of length @xmath15 , aligned with the @xmath23-axis , having a constant cross section @xmath16 with the boundary @xmath24 in the @xmath25 plane .",
    "the fluid flow is driven by a pressure gradient of @xmath26 which is turned on abruptly at time @xmath12 .",
    "we note that strictly speaking the pressure gradient is not established instantaneously , but rather on a time - scale set by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the speed of sound . for typical liquids",
    "@xmath29 which for micro - fluidic systems and practical purposes makes the pressure gradient appear almost instantaneously . from the symmetry of the problem",
    "it follows that the velocity field is of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 . from the navier",
    " stokes equation it then follows that @xmath32 is governed by , see e.g. refs .   or  , @xmath33 which is a diffusion equation for the momentum with the pressure drop acting as a source term on the right - hand side .",
    "the velocity @xmath34 is subject to a no - slip boundary condition on @xmath24 and obviously @xmath34 is initially zero , while it asymptotically approaches the steady - state velocity field @xmath35 for @xmath36 .    in the analysis it is natural to write the velocity as a difference @xmath37 of the asymptotic , static field @xmath38 , solving the poiseuille problem @xmath39 and a time - dependent field @xmath40 satisfying the homogeneous diffusion equation , @xmath41 from ref .",
    "it is known that rescaling the helmholz equation by @xmath42 leads to a lowest eigenvalue @xmath43 that is of order unity and only weakly geometry dependent .",
    "we therefore perform this rescaling , which naturally implies the time - scale @xmath11 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) and the following form of the diffusion equation , @xmath44 where we have introduced the rescaled laplacian @xmath45 , @xmath46 we note that by the rescaling the navier  stokes equation  ( [ eq : momentumdiffusion ] ) becomes @xmath47 where we have introduced the steady - state flow rate @xmath48 and used eq .",

    "in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsrescaled ] ) we will take advantage of the hilbert space formulation  @xcite , often employed in quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the hilbert space of real functions @xmath49 is defined by the inner product @xmath50 and a complete set @xmath51 of orthonormal basis functions , @xmath52 above , we have used the dirac _ bra - ket _ notation and @xmath53 is the kronecker delta . we choose the eigenfunctions @xmath54 of the rescaled helmholz equation ( with a zero dirichlet boundary condition on @xmath24 ) as our basis functions , @xmath55 with this complete basis any function in the hilbert space can be written as a linear combination of basis functions . using the _ bra - ket _ notation eq .",
