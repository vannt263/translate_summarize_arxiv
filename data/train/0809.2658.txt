    "in the early 1970s migdal suggested the possibility of pion condensation in a nuclear medium @xcite . since then , many efforts have been made in order to clarify the in - medium pion properties affected by the pion - nucleon interaction @xcite , because a better insight of such condensation phenomena would yield important advances not only in subnuclear physics such as that of pionic atoms @xcite , but also in the physics of neutron stars @xcite , supernovas @xcite , and the heavy ion collisions @xcite . from the results of the experiments concerning the repulsive @xmath3 interaction , the simplest possibility ,",
    "the @xmath4-wave pion condensation is highly unlikely to be realized in nature .",
    "in contrast , the possibility of @xmath5-wave pion condensation has been widely argued @xcite , even though it still remains as a matter of debate if this occurs at several times the ordinary nuclear density .",
    "most of the studies about this issue performed so far are mainly concerned with the role of the coupling between pions and baryons in the nuclear medium @xcite , considering the pion itself as an elementary object .",
    "however , since the pion is considered to be the nambu - goldstone boson associated with chiral symmetry breaking , its _ internal structure _ and _ mass _ may also be sensitive to the modification of the qcd vacuum itself in the finite density environment @xcite ; the finite baryon density , and even the isospin density arising from the neutrality condition , can modify the structure of the qcd ground state , and it can in turn produce significant modifications of the pion properties in the medium .    in this article",
    "we revisit the possibility of @xmath4-wave charged pion ( @xmath6 ) condensation starting from a _ microscopic _ model which is built with quarks as the constituents of pions , and which exhibits chiral symmetry restoration at the finite quark chemical potential @xmath7 or temperature @xmath8 .",
    "this strategy also enables us to present a unified view on the possible crossover from a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath9 condensate to a bcs - type @xmath10 superfluid ( bcs - bec crossover ) at finite isospin density @xcite .",
    "this possibility was first speculated by applying the chiral lagrangian at low @xmath11 and the perturbative qcd result at high @xmath11 @xcite ; since then , the qcd phase structure at finite isospin density has been widely investigated using the chiral effective models @xcite , a lattice - based model @xcite , the random matrix model @xcite , and the lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "since @xmath7 acts as the external field producing a mismatch in @xmath12-@xmath13 fermi surfaces @xcite , our problem also closely intersects with the problem of the bcs - bec crossover with a density imbalance in the cold atomic systems @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be noted that in refs .",
    "@xcite some window was found for the @xmath4-wave @xmath6 condensate on the finite @xmath7 axis in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model .",
    "this was called the `` _ gapless pion condensate _ '' since the constituent quark presents a gapless dispersion relation , due to @xmath12-@xmath13 fermi surface mismatch .",
    "our purpose here includes clarification of how this can be understood consistently with the number of negative results on the @xmath4-wave pion condensate obtained in the past . to this end",
    ", we derive the appropriate criterion for @xmath6 condensation , and based on this criterion , we show that the @xmath6 condensation found in @xcite is extremely fragile to explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to a finite current quark mass .",
    "the purpose of this article is twofold .",
    "first , we investigate the conditions for the onset of @xmath6 condensation at finite density using the njl model of qcd ; in this model pions are not elementary fields , but they are described as the bound states of quarks . we find that even in such a composite pion model with dynamical quarks , the threshold for @xmath6 condensation for noninteracting elementary pion gas , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) for positive ( negative ) @xmath16 ( with @xmath16 being the electric chemical potential ) , holds as well .",
    "this enables us to elucidate the effect of the current quark mass in the neutral ground state , which will be summarized by drawing the phase diagram in the @xmath17 plane , where @xmath18 denotes the vacuum pion mass .",
    "furthermore we investigate the effect of @xmath16 at the physical value of the current quark mass drawing a phase diagram in the @xmath19 plane .",
    "based on these analyses , we conclude that @xmath6 condensation is forbidden in realistic neutral quark matter .",
    "we study two - flavor quark matter at a finite chemical potential within the njl model .",
    "the lagrangian of the model is given by  @xcite @xmath20~ , \\label{eq : lagr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath21 denotes the electron field , and @xmath22 is the quark spinor with dirac , color and flavor indices ( implicitly summed ) .",
    "@xmath23 is the bare quark mass and @xmath24 is the coupling constant .",
    "@xmath16 is the electric charge chemical potential needed to keep the system electrically neutral @xcite , while @xmath11 serves as the isospin chemical potential in the hadron sector , @xmath25 since @xmath26 .",
    "the quark chemical potential matrix @xmath27 is defined in flavor - color space as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the identity matrix in color space , @xmath7 is the quark chemical potential related to the conserved baryon number . by performing the mean field approximation",
    ", we examine the possibility that the ground state develops condensation in the @xmath30 and/or @xmath31 channels , where @xmath32 denotes the pauli matrices .",
    "we find that @xmath33 is always zero , as there is no driving force , so we omit it in the following .",
    "we use the notation , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in the numerical analyses , we fix @xmath36 mev and @xmath37 so that the model reproduces @xmath38 mev , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 mev in the vacuum with @xmath41 mev .",
    "the global symmetry of the model at @xmath42 is the @xmath43 chiral symmetry .",
    "this symmetry will be broken spontaneously to @xmath44 by the emergence of a nonzero condensate @xmath45 . when the finite quark mass @xmath2 is turned on , the original chiral symmetry is explicitly broken to the diagonal subgroup @xmath46 .",
    "this forces the chiral condensate to the @xmath47 direction ( vacuum alignment ) , and the pions as goldstone bosons acquire a mass , but they remain degenerate in the isospin triplet .",
    "the effect of a small @xmath11 is then to split the masses of the three pions , since the diagonal @xmath48 is broken explicitly to @xmath49 , which denotes the rotation about the isospin third axis . when @xmath50 and/or @xmath51 condensates ( or simply @xmath52 ) become nonzero , this @xmath49 symmetry gets spontaneously broken and we expect one massless goldstone boson to appear .",
    "it is interesting to note that when the discrete parity is considered together , there remains one discrete symmetry even in the pion condensed phase .",
    "the parity operation acts as @xmath53 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 , also flips the sign of the @xmath6 condensate .",
    "hence , the combined transformation , a _ rotated parity _",
    "@xmath56 , remains unbroken .",
    "the new symmetry breaking pattern of the @xmath6 condensate can be specified as @xmath57 .",
    "the new parity @xmath58 is analogous to what is discussed in @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath7 breaks the charge conjugation , causing stress which produces a mismatch in @xmath12 and @xmath13 densities that are equal at small ( large ) @xmath7 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "before discussing @xmath6 condensation in the medium , it is instructive to review the classical arguments at @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "the shift of the vacuum energy caused by the pion fields at the lowest nonvanishing order in the fields @xmath60 is @xmath61 . from this",
    "we can infer that in the chiral limit ( @xmath62 ) an infinitesimally small value of @xmath11 favors condensation , @xmath63 . in the general case of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the condition @xmath66 needs to be fulfilled so that the @xmath6 condensation turns out to be energetically favored . in this kind of approach , using chiral perturbation theory , the chiral @xmath44 multiplets are elementary fields whose internal structures do not suffer from any quantum corrections . on the other hand ,",
    "the same threshold at @xmath59 is obtained also in the njl - type model  @xcite .",
    "we now consider neutral quark matter at @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we are interested in the relation between the threshold of @xmath6 condensation at finite density and the in - medium pion masses in the neutral ground state .",
    "we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that at the physical point @xmath41 mev , there is no room for @xmath6 condensation in the neutral phase .",
    "similar conclusion is also obtained in @xcite .",
    "this picture changes if we lower the current quark mass .",
    "we discuss this point in detail later . for our present purpose",
    "it is enough to state that we need a current quark mass of the order of 10 kev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : masse ] we plot @xmath69 and @xmath52 in the neutral phase as a function of @xmath7 for @xmath70 kev . in this figure @xmath71 ,",
    "@xmath72 denote the in - medium pion masses defined by the poles of the pion propagators in the rest frame , computed in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) to the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation . for charged pion sector in the phase of a vanishing pion condensate @xmath73 ,",
    "the pole condition is @xmath74 with @xmath75 being the inverse @xmath76 propagator , @xmath77 , @xmath78 being the number of colors , and @xmath79 being the polarization defined by @xmath80\\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the fermi distribution .",
    "we note that the polarization function is not symmetric under @xmath82 if there is a finite isospin density in the system , @xmath83 ; this asymmetry is responsible for the mass splitting of @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the excitation gaps for @xmath76 and @xmath9 are accordingly given by @xmath86 and @xmath87 , corresponding to positive and negative solutions to the bs equation in @xmath88 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : masse ] we notice that the transition to the pion condensed phase is of second order and it occurs at the point where @xmath89 .    ,",
    "the pion condensate @xmath52 , and meson masses as a function of @xmath7 at @xmath68 in the neutral phase for a toy value of the current quark mass @xmath70 kev.,width=302 ]    the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : masse ] can be understood by a closer inspection to the bs equation and the gap equation for pion condensate .",
    "although the argument below applies even to the @xmath90 case , we set @xmath68 for simplicity . for small @xmath52",
    ", we expand the free energy of the ground state up to fourth order in the charged pion condensate @xmath91 , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the free energy at @xmath73 .",
    "it can be shown that the second order coefficient @xmath94 has the same structure as the @xmath76 propagator , with @xmath95 replaced by @xmath96 , i.e. , @xmath97 .",
    "provided that the transition to the @xmath6 condensed phase is of second order , the critical condition is given by the linearized gap equation , @xmath98 , that determines the line of the critical electric chemical potential @xmath99 in the @xmath100 plane . from the equality of the pion propagator and @xmath94",
    "noted above , one immediately obtains the threshold @xmath101 for positive ( negative ) @xmath16 .",
    "this is because @xmath102 is also satisfied on the critical line @xmath103 , and this solution corresponds to the negative ( positive ) root of the bs when @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the above argument holds either with or without the neutrality condition .",
    "the neutrality condition determines the neutrality line @xmath106 in the @xmath107 plane . at @xmath70 kev , @xmath99 and",
    "@xmath106 intersect at the point @xmath108 mev .",
    "this fact is somehow implicit in fig .",
    "[ fig : masse ] where the physical quantities only along @xmath106 is sketched .",
    "we see from the figure that , as soon as @xmath7 exceeds the value of the vacuum constituent quark mass @xmath109 , @xmath16 becomes finite due to the appearance of quark fermi surfaces .",
    "accordingly , the mass degeneracy in the pion sector gets lifted .    when the critical point @xmath110(@xmath111 for the transition from the chiral symmetry broken phase to the pion condensed phase corresponds to the critical baryon density @xmath112 , with @xmath113 being the nuclear saturation density @xmath114 .",
    "the electron fraction is @xmath115 .",
    "these values are unconventionally small , which is simply attributed to the fact that we are working near the unphysical chiral limit , @xmath116 . ] ) is reached , @xmath16 hits @xmath85 from below , resulting in the gapless excitation in the @xmath9 mode .",
    "thereafter , @xmath9 mode in the @xmath73 phase changes into the exact nambu - goldstone boson associated with @xmath49 breaking ; the excitation stays gapless due to the mixing of @xmath117 modes in the bs equation for @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "we also notice that the increase of @xmath16 is somehow quenched as soon as the system experiences the transition to the pion condensed phase .",
    "this is reasonable because the @xmath9 condensate tries to accommodate the @xmath119 quark fermi surface that helps cancel the positive charge arising from @xmath12 quarks ; then less electrons are needed .",
    "the pion condensed phase continues up to @xmath120 where the system encounters the first order phase transition into the almost chirally symmetric quark matter phase ; the phase is characterized by @xmath121 .",
    "since we are working near the chiral limit @xmath116 , the mass splitting in the sigma and neutral pion sector is tiny .",
    "in fact @xmath122 is only slightly larger than @xmath123 ; the difference is less than @xmath124 which is actually invisible in the figure .",
    "a few remarks are in order with regards to the nature of pion condensed phase obtained here : ( i )  having a look at the fermionic spectrum , we can see that it is of gapless type  @xcite .",
    "( ii )  an investigation of the spectral functions in the bosonic sector leads us to conclude that it is the bec of the real @xmath125 bound state ( @xmath9 ) rather than the bcs - like pionic superfluid .",
    "let us first address point ( ii ) .",
    "it is enough for our present purpose to focus on the onset of the pion condensed phase . at the onset @xmath126 ,",
    "the @xmath9 mode becomes gapless , which means the inverse @xmath9 propagator is zero at @xmath127 . on the other hand , looking at the spectral density , the imaginary part of the @xmath9 propagator , it is easy to see that the threshold for the @xmath128 continuum at rest @xmath129 is located at @xmath130",
    ". then , @xmath131 in the @xmath9 propagator is realized as an isolated bound state pole if @xmath132 , while in the opposite case it is realized as a soft mode peak whose width goes to zero only when its momentum @xmath133 goes to zero .",
    "actually the former is realized here , so the system is the bec ; the isospin chemical potential @xmath134 is too small to realize the bcs - like superfluid state @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to point ( i ) .",
    "the dispersion relations for quasiquarks in the pion condensed phase are given by @xmath135   e_{\\tilde{d}}(p)&=&\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{m^2+p^2}-\\mu_e/2)^2 + n^2 } -(\\mu - { \\mu_e}/{6 } ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) represents the quasiquark which has a large @xmath12-quark ( @xmath119-quark ) content at large @xmath138 .",
    "since we have already noted that @xmath139 in the bec , each quasiquark energy has a minimum at @xmath140 . then we see that both quasiquarks have a blocking region in @xmath138-space , defined by the condition @xmath141 ; the constituent @xmath12 and @xmath119 quarks are , accordingly , accumulated in those regions . from ( i ) and ( ii ) , we may conclude that the system is the bec of the real @xmath125 bound state ( @xmath9 ) formed in the charge neutral background characterized by the fermi seas of @xmath12 , @xmath119 quarks , and electrons .",
    "in the past years , a large number of the calculations dealing with the issue of @xmath6 condensation have been performed in the chiral limit .",
    "this treatment is simple from the point of view of calculations but somehow unphysical . in this section",
    "we investigate the role of the current quark mass in @xmath6 condensation . in this analysis",
    "we fix the cutoff @xmath142 and the coupling @xmath24 to the values specified above and we treat @xmath2 as a free parameter . as a consequence ,",
    "the pion mass at @xmath143 , @xmath18 in the following , is a free parameter as well .",
    "plane.,width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasempi ] we report the phase diagram in @xmath17 plane in the neutral case .",
    "the solid line represents the border between the two regions where chiral symmetry is broken and restored .",
    "the bold dot is the critical endpoint of the first order transition .",
    "the shaded region indicates the region where @xmath6 condensation occurs . in the chiral limit @xmath144 our results are in good agreement with those obtained in ref",
    ".  @xcite . as we discussed in the previous section ,",
    "there exist two critical values of the quark chemical potential , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , corresponding to the onset and vanishing of @xmath6 condensation , respectively . increasing the current quark mass results in the shrinking of the shaded region till the point @xmath147 for @xmath148 , corresponding to a current quark mass of @xmath149 .",
    "hence we have shown that the gapless @xmath6 condensation is extremely fragile with respect to the symmetry breaking effect of the current quark mass ; this can be understood by observing the fact that the increase of quark mass leads to a drastic magnification of the vacuum pion mass at small @xmath2 because of @xmath150 , while the change in quark mass in kev scale brings about no significant modification in @xmath16 .",
    "plane at @xmath41 mev.,width=302 ]",
    "as a final investigation , in fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediag ] we draw the phase diagram of quark matter in the @xmath151 plane in the physical limit where the current quark mass is tuned to @xmath41 mev . at each value of @xmath151",
    "we compute the chiral and pion condensates by minimization of the thermodynamical potential .",
    "the solid line represents the first order transition from the @xmath6 condensed phase to the chiral symmetry broken phase without the @xmath6 condensate .",
    "the bold dot is the critical endpoint for the first order transition , after which the second order transition sets in . the dashed line indicates the first order transition between the two regions where chiral symmetry is broken and restored , respectively .",
    "the dot - dashed line is the neutrality line @xmath152 which is obtained by requiring the global electrical neutrality condition , @xmath153 .",
    "the neutrality line manifestly shows the impossibility of finding a @xmath6 condensate in a physical situation .",
    "in this article we have studied the phenomenology of @xmath6 condensation in two - flavor neutral quark matter using a nambu  jona - lasinio model of qcd . in particular , we have clarified the role of the quark mass @xmath2 and the electric chemical potential @xmath16 .",
    "our central results is that the threshold to the @xmath6 condensed phase , @xmath14 , persists even for a composite pionic gas in the presence of dynamical quarks provided the transition to the @xmath6 condensed phase is of second order , which is indeed true up to @xmath154 mev .",
    "furthermore , we have found that the possibility of @xmath6 condensation is ruled out in neutral quark matter with a current quark mass larger than the order of 10 kev .",
    "we have given a natural explanation for this fact by using the threshold criterion noted above .",
    "as a further result we have computed the phase diagram in the @xmath151 plane at the physical quark mass . we find that the transition to the @xmath6 condensed phase is of second order up to @xmath155 mev , after which it turns into a first order one .",
    "by superimposing the neutrality line onto the phase diagram , we have shown that neutral quark matter never meets the regions of the nonvanishing @xmath6 condensate .",
    "thus we conclude that in neutral quark matter at the physical quark mass , the njl model does not allow charged pion condensation in the ground state .    in the present analyses , we have focused on the modification of pion propagation due to the character change of the qcd ground state with respect to the finite baryon ( and isospin ) density environment",
    ". it should be noted , however , that in our restricted treatment , the contribution to finite baryon density comes only from constituent quarks and not from nucleons .",
    "the existence of nucleons , the bound states of constituent quarks , should make @xmath4-wave @xmath6 condensation even less favorable .",
    "this is because the tomozawa - weinberg interaction between the nucleon and the pion is isospin odd , giving rise to repulsive pion self - energy at the physical situation where the neutron density is larger than the proton density , i.e. , @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting , though challenging , to investigate pion condensation by taking into account nucleon degrees of freedom within the njl model .",
    "the prescription made in @xcite may be useful .",
