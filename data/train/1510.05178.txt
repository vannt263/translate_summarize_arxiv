    "note that due to hermity of density matrix , its coefficients of expansion @xmath268 are real numbers and due to unit trace of @xmath269 we have @xmath270 .    using the decomposition of @xmath269 in ( [ eq : decompositiondensitygeneral ] )",

    "as explained in section [ sec : dtcpriliminaries ] , the convergence rate of the obtained dtc problem is dictated by the second largest eigenvalue modulus ( slem ) of the weight matrix @xmath288 defined as , @xmath289 where the weight matrix @xmath290 is @xmath291 .",
    "thus the corresponding fastest discrete time consensus problem can be written as the following optimization problem , @xmath292 we refer to this problem as the fastest discrete time quantum consensus ( fdtqc ) problem .",
    "the state update equation ( [ eq : lindblad2 ] ) reaches quantum consensus ( [ eq : qcmefinalconsensus ] ) , due to the fact that the generating set is selected in a away that the whole group of @xmath131 can be generated and the resultant cayley graph of @xmath131 is connected .",
    "even though , the quantum consensus is achieved but surprisingly , the equations in ( [ eq : densityequation1 ] ) indicate that all agents are not able to exchange information with each other .",
    "this is due to the fact that the underlying graph of the dtc problem obtained from ( [ eq : densityequation1 ] ) is not connected and the consensus is not reachable in the same sense as in the classical dtc problem , where the sufficient condition for reaching consensus is the connected underlying communication graph .    from the right hand side of the equation ( [ eq : densityequation1 ] )",

    "each one of these connected components has identical impact on the convergence rate of the state update equation ( [ eq : lindblad2 ] ) to its quantum consensus state ( [ eq : qcmefinalconsensus ] ) .",

    "based on the one to one correspondence between agent states and the right or left cosets of @xmath335 in @xmath131 , it can be concluded that the connected component is the schreier coset graph of permutation group @xmath14 with young subgroup @xmath129 and generating set consisting of transpositions associated with edges of the underlying graph of the quantum network . for the case of trivial @xmath335 ( i.e. @xmath336 )",

    "association scheme [ associationscheme ] + let @xmath48 be a set of @xmath0 vertices and assume @xmath509 be a set of nonempty relations on @xmath48 ( subsets of @xmath510 ) satisfying the following conditions , @xmath511 to @xmath512 . then the pair @xmath513 is called an association scheme .",
    "the constraints on relations are as below , + @xmath514 is a partition of @xmath515 + @xmath516 + @xmath517 for @xmath518 , where @xmath519 + @xmath512 for @xmath520 , the number @xmath521 does not depend on @xmath522 but only on @xmath523 and @xmath230 .",
    "+ then , @xmath524 defines a symmetric association scheme of class @xmath2 on @xmath48 .",
    "further , if @xmath525 for all @xmath526 , then @xmath527 is called commutative .",
    "let @xmath524 be a commutative symmetric association scheme of class @xmath2 , then the matrices @xmath528 defined by @xmath529 are adjacency matrices of @xmath527 and are such that @xmath530 from ( [ ss ] ) , it is seen that the adjacency matrices @xmath531 form a basis for a commutative algebra known as the bose - mesner algebra of @xmath527 .",
    "this algebra has a second basis @xmath532 primitive idempotents , defined as @xmath533 , @xmath534 , @xmath535 , where , @xmath536 and @xmath537 is the @xmath538 all-@xmath32 matrix in @xmath539 .",
    "let @xmath540 and @xmath541 be the matrices relating the two basis for @xmath539 : @xmath542 and @xmath543 , for @xmath544 .",
    "then clearly we have @xmath545 .",
    "it also follows that @xmath546 .",
    "the scalars @xmath547 are called the eigenvalues of the scheme . since they are eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath548 , they are algebraic integers ( respectively the scalars @xmath549 are called the dual eigenvalues of the scheme ) ; the columns of @xmath550 are the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "thus @xmath551 rank(@xmath550 ) is the multiplicity of the eigenvalue @xmath547 of @xmath548 ( provided that @xmath552 for @xmath553 ) .",
    "we see that @xmath554 , and @xmath551trace@xmath555 ( indeed , @xmath550 has only eigenvalues @xmath447 and @xmath32 , so rank(@xmath556 ) equals the sum of the eigenvalues ) .",
    "one of the important schemes is the group scheme as explained below ,    group association scheme [ groupassociationscheme ] + let @xmath52 be a group ; then it can be proved that the set of relations defined by @xmath557 , where @xmath558 are the set of conjugacy classes of @xmath52 , satisfy the four constraints ( 1)-(4 ) in the definition of association scheme conditions ( definition [ associationscheme ] ) , so @xmath559 is a symmetric association scheme .    defining class sums @xmath560 for @xmath561 as @xmath562 , by the action of @xmath563 on group elements in the regular representation we observe that @xmath564 , so @xmath565 thus due to ( [ ss ] ) , the relation @xmath566 hold true .",
    "one can show that @xmath567 therefore the group scheme is a commutative scheme .",
    "furthermore they also commute with every element of the group i.e. @xmath568    however from group theory we know that the coefficients @xmath569 have to be nonnegative integers , and their value is given by the following relation @xcite : @xmath570 where the sum is over all the irreducible characters @xmath571 of @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the idempotents @xmath572 of the group association scheme @xmath573 are the projection operators of @xmath67-module , i.e. , @xmath574 .",
    "thus , eigenvalues of adjacency matrices of @xmath575 and idempotents @xmath556 , respectively , are @xmath576 and @xmath577 , where @xmath578s are the dimensions of the irreducible characters @xmath579 which are positive integers , and @xmath580 is the number of elements in the conjugate class @xmath581 , which is the degree of its corresponding adjacency matrix . since @xmath582 for all @xmath54 are identical therefore in the formulations above @xmath583 is employed instead of @xmath582 .    from relation ( [ eq:2021 ] )",
    "it is obvious that in any matrix representation the adjacency matrices @xmath584 commute with all elements of group , therefore according to schur s lemma @xmath584 should be proportional to identity matrix i.e. @xmath585 where @xmath586 is the @xmath33-th eigenvalue of the adjacency matrices of @xmath584 .      for each partition @xmath587 , @xmath131 has a corresponding conjugacy class which consists of those permutations having cycle structure described by @xmath105 .",
    "the cycle structure are the listing of number of cycles of each length ( i.e , @xmath588 is the number of @xmath19 cycles ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath589 the conjugacy class of @xmath131 consisting of all permutations having cycle structure @xmath105 .",
    "therefore the number of conjugacy classes of @xmath131 , namely the diameter of its scheme is equal to the number of partitions of @xmath0 .",
    "here we are concerned with the adjacency matrix corresponding to @xmath590 and its spectrum , since this adjacency matrix is same as the adjacency matrix of the induced graph corresponding to partition @xmath381 ( cayley graph ) if the underlying graph of the quantum network is a complete graph .",
    "the adjacency matrix corresponding to @xmath590 is @xmath591 , where @xmath592 is the matrix representation of the transposition @xmath593 in @xmath131-regular representation .    to obtain the spectrum of the adjacency matrix @xmath594 , introduced above , the character of @xmath595 is required which is as below @xcite , @xmath596 here",
    ", @xmath597 is the conjugate of partition @xmath105 , while @xmath598 and @xmath599 are the @xmath33-th components of the partitions @xmath133 and @xmath105 , and @xmath335 is the irreducible specht module corresponding to partition @xmath105 .    since the representation is regular then @xmath600 is equal to @xmath601 .",
    "@xmath602 is the cardinality of the first conjugate class @xmath603 which is the number of possible transpositions .",
    "then the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix @xmath594 can be written as @xmath604    now using ( [ eq:2077 ] ) , in the irreducible representation corresponding to a given partition @xmath105 , the adjacency matrix @xmath594 can be written as below @xmath605      now we are ready to provide the optimal weights and the slem of the discrete time quantum consensus problem over a quantum network with complete graph topology . to do so ,",
    "we first obtain the spectrum of the laplacian matrix @xmath606 of the induced graphs given in ( [ eq : robustsolitondistribution1540 ] ) , which is possible by obtaining the spectrum of @xmath607 .",
    "this is achievable for partition @xmath381 , since for this partition we have @xmath608 where @xmath508 is the weight on each edge of the complete graph and the spectrum of @xmath609 is provided above in subsection [ sec : associationschemeofgroupsn ] . restricting relation ( [ eq:2290 ] ) to an irreducible representation",
    "corresponding to partition @xmath105 , using ( [ eq : laplacianpartitionblocksum ] ) the left hand side of ( [ eq:2290 ] ) becomes @xmath610 while using ( [ eq:2234 ] ) the right hand side can be written as @xmath611 .",
    "therefore , for each block of @xmath606 in ( [ eq : laplacianpartitionblocksum ] ) we have @xmath612    considering ( [ eq:2302 ] ) for the given partition @xmath105 , the eigenvalues of @xmath366 are @xmath613 where @xmath133 includes all partitions dominant to partition @xmath105 , with @xmath614 given in ( [ eigen2220 ] ) .",
    "this is the main result of this section towards calculating the optimal slem of the discrete time quantum consensus problem for a quantum network with complete graph topology .    in the following , we provide the optimal results for a quantum network with @xmath0 qubits . for complete graph as the underlying graph ,",
    "the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix @xmath606 for all partitions ( other than @xmath395 ) is the eigenvalue of @xmath418 in ( [ eq : laplacianpartitionblocksum ] ) which is @xmath615 .",
    "regarding @xmath616 depending on the value of @xmath0 there are four different categories , namely @xmath617 for @xmath618 and @xmath619 .",
    "* @xmath620 : in this case , since partition @xmath621 is the least dominant partition , @xmath616 is obtained from @xmath622 . from ( [ eigen2220 ] ) , @xmath623 for @xmath621 and its conjugate partition @xmath624 can be calculated as @xmath625 , and by substituting @xmath626 and @xmath623 in ( [ 2313 ] ) for @xmath627 we obtain @xmath628 . for optimal the weights we have @xmath629 which results in the optimal @xmath508 as @xmath630 and thus the corresponding optimal slem is @xmath631 .",

    "the solution procedure is similar as above but for higher number of number of categories that is @xmath641 .",
    "in this paper , we have optimized the convergence rate of the quantum consensus algorithm over a quantum network with @xmath0 qudits . for the study presented in this paper we have considered the discrete time model of the quantum consensus algorithm .",
