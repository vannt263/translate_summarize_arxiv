    "quantum physics revealed many advantages overcoming the limits of classical physics . while classical physics deals with large macroscopic systems , quantum physics describes various non - classical effects in microscopic systems . during the last decades , the control of microscopic quantum systems , like photons and atoms @xcite , allowed to test the potential of quantum physics in communication , metrology and computing . in many cases",
    "the control remains quite challenging because of sensitive and tiny character of microscopic systems .",
    "the key solution can be found in macroscopic quantum states of light which are easy to handle like in classical optics , but still keep relevant quantum features , which are needed for a given task .",
    "a macroscopic nature however simultaneously means that large number of atoms or optical modes can not be precisely controlled .",
    "it is contradictory to existence of many very sensitive quantum phenomena .",
    "a loss of single particle or mode can often cause a large reduction of quantum nonclassical effects , which could bring quantum states closer to classical ones .    as an example of the macroscopic nonclassical quantum states , bright twin beams and entangled states of large numbers of atoms",
    "have been generated during the last decades @xcite .",
    "the bright photonic twin beams represent an empirical evidence of non - classical states visible by a naked eye , they are therefore easy to manipulate like the classical light beams .",
    "the twin beams are non - classical because they are highly correlated in energy , which contradicts classical wave theory @xcite .",
    "high energy of both beams arises from large number of the modes , which results in the macroscopic character of the beams .",
    "the photon number correlations are fortunately robust against a loss of few modes or receiving of a small number of unmatched modes in the detectors .",
    "such robustness allows one to detect quantum features of macroscopic beams .",
    "a single pair of correlated modes inside the twin beam is also entangled in phase - sensitive continuous variables ( cvs ) of light @xcite",
    ". it can be detected by a pair of single - mode homodyne detectors with strongly coherent local oscillators ( lo ) , serving as the phase references .",
    "such entangled states have interestingly a direct application , they can be used to generate a secure key between two distant parties in cv quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite , which was previously also shown possible with the coherent states of light @xcite .",
    "the symmetrical multimode entangled states with low energy can still be indistinguishably detected by multimode homodyne detectors , if the sufficiently large - amplitude los are matching all the modes of entangled states .",
    "the modes , which are not matched to the lo , are simply negligible , compared to the matched modes .",
    "consequently , the multimode detectors allow to generate a secure key equivalently to the single - mode detection as it was recently shown in @xcite .",
    "now as a final step towards the use of classical beams , in the sense of their macroscopic character , for quantum communication , we consider the bright multimode states and waive the assumption of the weakness of the beams used for quantum communication .    in this paper",
    "we show that as the energy of multimode beams increases , the homodyne detector starts to be sensitive to the large incoming energy of the modes which are not matched to lo .",
    "this sensitivity in fact witnesses the macroscopically large intensity received by a homodyne detector .",
    "when the macroscopic modes do not match any mode of the lo , they directly contribute to the noise of the detector .",
    "homodyne detection then becomes more noisy because of the detection of macroscopic very bright light .",
    "the homodyne measurements of weak states with additional unmatched signals was previously studied in the context of ultrafast detection @xcite . in the current paper",
    "we show how the structure of the bright matched and unmatched signal and also how unbalancing of the homodyne detection influence the noise caused by the macroscopic character of the states , and then focus on the role of such noise in the detection of nonclassical properties of light as well as on the applicability of the macroscopic states to qkd .",
    "this type of noise can be small , however , it can not be neglected since it comes from outside of the detector . it can be fully exploited by an eavesdropper to substantially reduce security of qkd .",
    "it therefore represents the most relevant limitation for the application of macroscopic nonclassical states of light in secure quantum communication .    using the homodyne detection of bright nonclassical light",
    ", we propose the feasible cv qkd implementation with the macroscopically bright nonclassical beams .",
    "our proposal opposes the discrete - variable qkd ( see @xcite for review ) , based on the single photons and faint light beams , and represents the very natural extension of cv qkd on the macroscopic states .",
    "we suggest an optimal way of implementing qkd with bright beams , which are easy to handle since they can be visible by a naked eye . the homodyne detector noise caused by the macroscopic beams is nonlinear , it depends on intensity of impinging light .",
    "due to this , a trade - off appears between security and macroscopic nature when entanglement increases .",
    "a distance of secure transmission is shorten by that noise , when intensity increases , but the security can be still guaranteed for .",
    "it is therefore possible to extend cv qkd to the macroscopic version . in this way",
    ", qkd can be finally realized by visible beams having the same features as the classical optical beams .",
    "in classical optics , light beams typically consist of large number of modes , which are not individually controllable and measurable . to demonstrate the delicate aspect of such macroscopic nature of the signal states we consider each of the beams consisting of @xmath0 modes matched with the respective lo modes ( which are shared between the communicating parties or are generated locally @xcite , and serve as a phase reference ) , and @xmath1 unmatched modes which do not match any lo modes .",
    "we study the impact of the bright auxiliary modes , which are not matched by the lo modes , but can affect the quadrature measurement and contribute to the noise in the quadrature variance",
    ". the mode mismatch can be the result of the difference in the mode structures of the source and the lo , but it can also be imposed by the effects in the channel such as the mode dispersion , when some of the signal modes lose mutual coherence with the respective modes of the lo .     are coupled to lo modes @xmath2 and unmatched n signal modes @xmath3 are coupled to respective vacuum modes @xmath3 on a generally unbalanced beamsplitter with transmittances @xmath4 and @xmath5 for modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the quadrature measurement consists in detecting the photocurrent difference between the two photodetectors on the output ports of the coupling beamsplitter.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the multimode version of homodyne detection depicted in the fig .",
    "[ scheme_detection ] , the coupling between the signal modes and the bright or vacuum modes of the lo modes is provided by a beamsplitter .",
    "one input of the beamsplitter is fed by the matched signal modes , characterized by the quantum operators @xmath8 and the auxiliary unmatched modes of the source , characterized by @xmath9 .",
    "the other port is fed by the very bright lo modes @xmath10 , being the classical phase reference for the homodyne detection , which are coupled to the modes @xmath11 .",
    "the modes @xmath3 are coupled to the vacuum modes @xmath12 , i.e. , we assume that the modes @xmath3 are not matched by any of the bright modes of the lo .",
    "we thus assume here that the signal modes are either matched to the strong modes of the lo or not .",
    "furthermore , if modes @xmath3 are weak , they do not play role in the detection since they are not amplified , but if they are strong they do play role and require no lo to be amplified .",
    "the coupling constants can be generally different for different modes entering the beamsplitter ( i.e. the transmittance values of the coupling beamsplitter @xmath4 and @xmath5 are different for all the modes modes @xmath11 and @xmath3 ) and not exactly equal to @xmath13 , which we refer to as an imperfect ( unbalanced ) homodyne detection .",
    "note that vacuum input modes can also match the lo modes , but their effect would be negligible and is therefore not considered .",
    "the homodyne detection results in the photocurrent difference @xmath14 , which is proportional to the difference of the photon numbers @xmath15 measured at the two mode - nondiscriminating detectors . here",
    "@xmath16 is the coefficient applied during the measurement process to the data from one of the detectors , which is aimed at removing the contribution from the matched signal modes in the case of the unbalanced detection .",
    "this is the standard method in the homodyne detection and the role of the coefficient @xmath16 is discussed further in subsection [ ubdet ] .",
    "each of the photon numbers consists of the contributions from the output modes of the coupling beamsplitter @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 indicates an output mode after the coupling ) , which are defined by the well known input - output relations of a beamsplitter : @xmath20 similarly for the conjugate operators @xmath21 defined through the @xmath22 and for the operators of output modes @xmath23(and their conjugate ) , which are defined through the operators of the input modes @xmath24 ( and respectively their conjugate ) and are governed by the coupling ratios @xmath5 .",
    "the photon numbers detected by the photodetectors at the outputs of the coupling taking into account the suppression of the auxiliary modes then read @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "they can be obtained from the input - output relations eq .",
    "( [ inout ] ) as @xmath27 + { } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & { } + \\epsilon\\sum_j^n\\big[t_{b_j}b^\\dag_{s_j}b_{s_j}+\\sqrt{t_{b_j}(1-t_{b_j})}\\big(b^\\dag_{s_j}b_{v_j}+b^\\dag_{v_j}b_{s_j}\\big)+(1-t_{b_j})b^\\dag_{v_j}b_{b_j}\\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath28 + { } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & { } + \\epsilon\\sum_j^n\\big[(1-t_{b_j})b^\\dag_{s_j}b_{s_j}-\\sqrt{t_{b_j}(1-t_{b_j})}\\big(b^\\dag_{s_j}b_{v_j}+b^\\dag_{v_j}b_{s_j}\\big)+t_{b_j}b^\\dag_{v_j}b_{b_j}\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we assume that the measurement devices are able to partially filter out the contribution from the unmatched modes .",
    "this can be done , for example , by frequency or spatial filtering , depending on the nature of the multimode structure of the macroscopic light .",
    "we characterize the inefficiency of mode filtration by the coefficient @xmath29 , which is applied to the contribution from the auxiliary modes @xmath23 .",
    "such inefficiency can vary in different detectors therefore in our analysis we consider it to be an unknown parameter of a particular set - up .",
    "based on the estimation of @xmath29 for a given detector the possibility to filter out the unmatched signal can be estimated .",
    "we therefore use @xmath29 to characterize the robustness of the homodyne measurement of the macroscopic bright light and describe the ability of a homodyne detector to measure the macroscopic states on a microscopic level .",
    "the lo in a @xmath30-th mode is a sufficiently strong coherent beam which can be approximated by a classical complex amplitude as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the real amplitude and @xmath33 defines the phase ( both @xmath32 and @xmath33 assumed to be the same for all the lo modes ) .",
    "although the bright states are measured , the lo modes are still needed to be much brighter in order to reach effective and robust homodyne detection .",
    "therefore the homodyne detection is measuring the observable proportional to @xmath34 in the matched modes . if @xmath35 , the homodyne detection measures the quadrature @xmath36 of the signal , while for @xmath37 the conjugate quadrature @xmath38 is measured .",
    "further with no loss of generality we put @xmath33 to zero thus assuming that x - quadrature is measured in each of the signal modes .",
    "we first consider the optimal and simplest case of the balanced detection , i.e. @xmath39 for any @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in this case",
    "the photon numbers read @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the photon - number difference expressed through the operators of the incoming modes taking into account the parametrization of the lo is @xmath44 the measurement of the bright multimode light therefore consists of the balanced homodyne detection @xcite in the matched signal modes @xmath11 and the self - energy detection in the auxiliary signal modes @xmath3 resulting in the noise contribution .",
    "the noise arising from the brightness and multimode structure of the states becomes present in the quadrature variance measured by a homodyne detector .",
    "the quadrature variance is obtained from the variance of the difference photocurrent @xmath45 , where averaging is performed on the incoming states , namely the vacuum states in modes @xmath12 and thermal states ( twin beams with one of the beams being traced out after measurement at alice , or gaussian - modulated squeezed states ) in modes @xmath11 and @xmath3 .",
    "the quadrature variance is essential when studying gaussian nonclassical properties and their application in cv qkd .",
    "taking this into account and tracing out the vacuum modes @xmath3 we arrive at @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the variance of the difference photocurrent must be normalized by the vacuum variance corresponding to the measurement taken with the input signal being blocked which is typically done in the experiment .",
    "for the detector being considered such variance would be @xmath48 , thus the normalized variance becomes @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mean number of photons in a signal mode , @xmath51 is the quadrature variance of a signal mode , and @xmath52 thus the quadrature variance even in the case of the perfectly balanced homodyne detection involves the noise term which is proportional to the mean photon - number in the additional signal modes . clearly this inefficiency of the modes selection can be reduced by decreasing @xmath1 using better mode matching or by increasing amplitude @xmath32 of the lo . by reducing the inefficiency @xmath53 the noise term concerned with the macroscopic brightness of the signal can be strongly reduced .",
    "however it does not vanish as long as the bright unmatched modes are present .",
    "therefore the homodyne detection of the multimode bright light becomes equivalent to the homodyne detection on the single - mode signal with the excess noise proportional to the mean photon number of a signal mode .",
    "if the homodyne detection of the macroscopic multimode signal is unbalanced , then the normalized photocurrent difference involves an additional term , proportional to the photon - number variance in the signal mode , @xmath54 , so that in the two - mode case the normalized photocurrent difference reads @xmath55,\\ ] ] taking into account that the coefficient @xmath16 applied to the contribution @xmath56 from the second detector is @xmath57 so that the term proportional to @xmath58 vanishes . this way the impact of the photon number fluctuations in the main signal mode @xmath59 related to the unbalanced detection @xmath60 is compensated , but",
    "the effect of the unbalancing remains present in the contribution from the unmatched modes .    in the non - macroscopic regime",
    "the noise related to the unmatched signal modes can be also present in the results of the homodyne detection , but its amount is very small due to the low mean photon number and therefore can be typically neglected especially if the intensity of the beam is additionally decreased by the channel attenuation .",
    "however in the macroscopic case , when the states are heavily multimode and intense , the noise arising from the macroscopic character must be taken into account as it can become crucial for transmission of the entanglement or for the secure key distribution as we show in the next section .",
    "the limitations imposed by such the detection noise get more strict as the beams get closer to the macroscopic character .",
    "we consider the effect of the noise concerned with the homodyning of macroscopic bright states on the detection of nonclassical resources contained in the states as well as on the application to secure cv qkd .",
    "to do so we consider two main quantum communication scenarios used to share a nonclassical resource or a secure key : prepare - and - measure ( p&m ) and entanglement- ( epr- ) based as depicted in the fig .",
    "[ scheme_communication ] . in the case of p&m scenario ( fig .",
    "[ scheme_communication ] , left ) alice possesses a source of the multimode bright squeezed light with quadrature variance @xmath61 in each mode , and applies modulation ( random gaussian - distributed displacement ) to a signal up to the thermal state with variance @xmath62 .",
    "the signal then travels through a quantum channel to a remote party bob , who applies homodyne detection on the signal .",
    "the channel is characterized by transmittance @xmath63 and quadrature excess noise @xmath64 , given in shot - noise units ( snu ) of vacuum quadrature fluctuations . in the case of the epr - based scenario ( fig .",
    "[ scheme_communication ] , right ) alice prepares the bright multimode entangled states , being the combination of twin beam states in each of the pairs of modes , and measures one of the beams by a local homodyne detector , while the other beam travels through the channel and is measured by bob .",
    "we characterize the states by the mean photon number per mode @xmath50 or by total mean photon number per beam @xmath65 .",
    "the channel transforms a quadrature of a given i - th mode as @xmath66 ( similarly for @xmath67-quadrature ) , where @xmath68 stands for the random displacement introduced by the channel excess noise with variance @xmath69 , and @xmath70 represents a vacuum quadrature , corresponding to the pure channel loss , with @xmath71 .",
    "importantly , the channel transmittance degrades the signal by attenuating it , but also affects the noise arising from the macroscopic character of the signal , since the mean photon number @xmath50 in a signal mode is scaled as @xmath72 .",
    "this improves the applicability of the macroscopically bright nonclassical light in the practical communication scenarios over lossy channels .",
    "further we consider the particular cases and the role of macroscopic structure of the states on the resources and security of cv qkd with such states .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]",
    "we shown that the impact of macroscopic character of light on the realistic homodyne detection of the macroscopically bright multimode signal results in the additional noise , which depends on photon numbers in the unmatched signal modes .",
    "such noise reduces the entanglement and applicability of the states in secure quantum communication . however ,",
    "if the mode - matching is efficient and/or brightness of the individual modes is reduced , the entanglement and squeezing can be observed by a homodyne detector . based on this observation , we proposed the quantum communication scheme based on the macroscopic nonclassical light .",
    "we shown that qkd can be implemented with the macroscopically bright light .",
    "we therefore demonstrated the theoretical possibility of building secure quantum communication channels with the macroscopically bright nonclassical states of light .",
