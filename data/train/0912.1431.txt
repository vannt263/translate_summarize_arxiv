    "by definition , soft matter is easy to deform .",
    "some materials are soft because they have a high degree of symmetry .",
    "for example , the absence of long - range translational order in a liquid means that there is no resistance to shear in static equilibrium .",
    "other materials , such as colloidal crystals , have low symmetry but are soft since the fundamental constituents are large and the interactions between these constituents are of entropic origin , and therefore weak . for example , to estimate the shear modulus @xmath0 of a colloidal crystal , we assume a characteristic length scale @xmath1@xmath2 m and a characteristic energy scale of about ten times the thermal energy at room temperature , and find @xmath3pa . this estimate is far smaller than the typical elastic modulus for a molecular crystal , where covalent bonds and molecular sizes determine the size of the shear modulus . finally , many objects are soft since they are thin in one or two dimensions .",
    "it is a matter of common experience that bending a thin rod or plate is much easier than stretching .",
    "examples of thin objects at the micron scale abound : bacterial flagella , actin filaments , and cell membranes readily deform in response to thermal fluctuations or viscous forces arising in fluid flow .",
    "the key to understanding the physics of these systems often hinges on understanding the dynamics of their shapes .",
    "thus , the student of soft matter is led directly to the problem of describing how curves and surfaces deform under external forces .",
    "differential geometry is the natural tool for this task . in this review",
    ", we give a self - contained introduction to differential geometry of curves and surfaces that evolve in time .",
    "our intended audience is someone who wants to use these equations to elucidate physical phenomena .",
    "therefore , although our main focus is on mathematics , we give physical interpretations of the mathematics whenever possible .",
    "it is natural to ask why we need another review of differential geometry .",
    "there are introductory books of a purely mathematical nature that are excellent starting points for students @xcite .",
    "there are useful books with a broader mathematical scope , such as that of  @xcite . finally , there are books and reviews that introduce differential geometry in the context of solid mechanics  @xcite , fluid mechanics  @xcite , and soft matter  @xcite .",
    "our review is closest in spirit to these last four , but it is complementary since it emphasizes the variational point of view for deriving forces due to internal stresses acting on a stiff polymer or membrane . like the review @xcite , we give a unified treatment of curves and surfaces from the  extrinsic \" point of view , in which distances along curves and surfaces sitting in three - dimensional space are measured using the notion of distance in that three - dimensional space . the alternative  intrinsic \" approach to the differential geometry of surfaces is to work only with quantities that can be measured by a two - dimensional being living on the surface .",
    "for example , the curvature @xmath4 of a surface can be defined by comparing the circumference @xmath5 of a circle on the surface to the radius @xmath6 of the circle , as measured by the inhabitant of the surface .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ twodcurvature ] ; the formula relating @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 displayed in the figure can be readily confirmed for the case of a sphere ) .",
    "since polymers and membranes interact and bend in three - dimensional space , it is impossible to formulate their equations of motions in terms of intrinsic quantities only , and we will not hesitate to characterize curves and surfaces with extrinsic quantities such as length in three dimensions .     considers the relation between the circumference and radius of a circle in his curved world ; @xmath4 is a number he can determine by making careful measurements of length.,height=240 ]    in addition to the tension between the extrinsic and intrinsic points of view , the issue of choosing coordinates always arises when studying curves and surfaces . since geometric quantities such as vector fields and curvatures exist independently of the choice of coordinates , it is natural to define these quantities without invoking coordinates at all  @xcite .",
    "although this approach is elegant , it requires too much mathematical machinery for our purposes . in the case of curves ,",
    "the basic geometrical ideas can be captured with vector calculus .",
    "surfaces are more complicated and therefore require us to introduce some of the elements of the calculus of tensors , which we attempt to do with a minimal amount of formalism .",
    "a second reason not to insist on a coordinate - free approach is that physical considerations often single out a coordinate system or a class of coordinate systems as special .",
    "for example , we will see that arclength parametrization is natural for inextensible rods , and that convected coordinates  coordinates that are carried along by material particles  are natural for fluid membranes .",
    "a second point related to choice of coordinates is the distinction between an interface between two different phases and the physical surfaces that we study .",
    "for example , since a solidification front  @xcite advances through a substance while the material points of the substance remain at rest , we are free to use choose coordinates such that the interface velocity is always normal to the tangent plane  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the velocity of a material point in a polymer or membrane may have a component along the tangential direction .",
    "for motion of a polymer or membrane arising from deformation , this velocity component has physical consequences and can not be removed by a change of coordinates .",
    "to keep the review of manageable size , we limit the scope by disregarding thermal fluctuations . this assumption is a vast simplification , since the flexibility of polymers and membranes ensures that thermal undulations are always present . however , there are many shape - evolution problems in which these effects are small . furthermore , the formalism described in this review is also useful even for problems where thermal effects play an important role , such as the dynamics of tension in semiflexible polymers  @xcite and the surface tension of an undulating fluid membrane  @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly delineate the conditions under which thermal fluctuations are important .    first consider a filament in solution .",
    "the filament could be a semiflexible polymer such as dna or actin , or the flagellar filament of a bacterium  @xcite .",
    "these filaments resist bending , and may be described by an energy @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the bending modulus , with dimensions of energy times length , and @xmath9 is distance measured along the filament , and @xmath6 is the local radius of curvature of the filament",
    ". we will describe the curvature of a filament in much greater detail in  [ sec : rodkinematics ] ; for now the reader can simply imagine that the thermal motion of the molecules of the solution causes the filament to flex back and forth between arcs of constant curvature .",
    "if we imagine lengthening the filament , then our experience with macroscopic rods tells us that the filament is easier to bend .",
    "that is , for fixed filament stiffness @xmath8 , the same force applied perpendicular to the end of the filament leads to a greater deflection as the filament gets longer .",
    "thus , the longer the filament , the more it will bend spontaneously due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "we can estimate the length @xmath10 of a filament at which thermal fluctuations become important by equating thermal energy @xmath11 with the bending energy of a filament bent into an arc of one radian : @xmath12 , or @xmath13 .",
    "the length @xmath10 is called the persistence length . at room temperature ,",
    "the persistence length of dna is about 50 nm ; @xmath10 is of the order of microns for actin , and millimeters for microtubules and bacterial flagellar filaments  @xcite .",
    "the effects of thermal fluctuations are small when the length @xmath14 of a filament is small compared to @xmath10 , @xmath15 .    unlike interfaces which are simply the boundary between two phases , membranes are comprised of molecules that resist bending .",
    "therefore , the shapes of membranes are also governed by a bending energy . as we review in  [ sec : geomsurface ] , there are two radii of curvature at any point of a surface .",
    "thus , the bending energy of a fluid membrane is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the bending modulus or stiffness , with dimensions of energy , and @xmath18 is the element of of surface area .",
    "just as for filaments , we expect that as a membrane gets larger and larger , the thermal motion of the solvent is more and more effective at bending the membrane .",
    "however , since the units of @xmath17 do not contain a length , it is not immediately obvious how to estimate the persistence length using dimensional analysis",
    ". therefore , we must use a more detailed approach .    consider a membrane that is weakly perturbed by thermal motion and spanning a frame with dimensions @xmath19 .",
    "since the membrane is almost flat , it can be described as the graph of a height function @xmath20 over the @xmath21-plane . in  [ sec : geomsurface ] we will see that the energy in eq .",
    "( [ membenden ] ) may be approximated as @xmath22 our strategy for quantifying the effect of thermal fluctuations will be to estimate the scale @xmath14 at which fluctuations in the normal to the membrane , @xmath23 , become of the order of unity , or in other words , large enough to spoil the assumption that the membrane is almost flat . first , use the equipartition theorem to assign to each mode of the quadratic energy function ( [ equadratic ] ) the contribution @xmath24 toward the average energy . the simplest way to apply",
    "the equipartition theorem is to assume periodic boundary conditions and write the height as a fourier series , @xmath25h_\\mathbf{q}/l^2 $ ] , where the sum is over all wavevectors @xmath26 with the integers @xmath27 and @xmath28 less than a maximum value @xmath29 . the wavelength corresponding to the maximum is the smallest length at which the continuum theory applies , and is a molecular scale @xmath30 such as the thickness of the membrane .",
    "thus , the mean - square amplitude of the fluctuations of the height are @xmath31 longer wavelength ripples are easier to excite .",
    "we can now calculate the fluctuations in the normal direction @xmath32 . since the membrane is almost flat , it is convenient to calculate the mean - square fluctuations of the deviation @xmath33",
    "@xcite : @xmath34 the integral in eq .",
    "( [ qint ] ) runs over wavevectors ranging from the short - distance cutoff @xmath35 to the long - distance cutoff given by the scale of the frame , @xmath36 .",
    "assuming for simplicity a disc - shaped domain of integration , we find @xmath37 .",
    "the scale at which the thermal fluctuations lead to significant deformation of the membrane is the length scale @xmath38 for which @xmath39 , or @xmath40 for typical values @xmath41 nm and @xmath42 , the persistence length is extremely large .",
    "thus , thermal fluctuations are often disregarded in studies of the shape dynamics of vesicles .      to understand the physical mechanisms that govern the dynamics of filaments ,",
    "we describe the characteristic time scales for stretching , bending , and twisting .",
    "to get the orders of magnitude of these time scales , it is sufficient to use scaling arguments and work in the limit of small deflection from a straight filament .",
    "the precise nonlinear equations of motion require the development of the geometric tools presented in the later sections of this review .",
    "we begin by recalling some basic definitions from the mechanics of rods  @xcite and viscous fluids  @xcite .",
    "consider a straight rod of radius @xmath43 , with long axis aligned along @xmath44 and under longitudinal deformation .",
    "the stress @xmath45 , or force per unit area acting through a cross - section at @xmath44 , is proportional to the strain for small deformations : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the displacement of the cross - section of the rod originally at @xmath44 , and @xmath48 is the young s modulus with units of energy per volume .",
    "the net elastic force per length acting on the element of size @xmath49 is therefore given by @xmath50 .",
    "now suppose the rod is allowed to relax , with the only resistance to the relaxation being the viscous drag of the solvent .    to estimate the viscous resistance , we first argue that at the small scales of polymer and cells , the typical viscous forces are much larger than the forces that are required to change the velocity of the fluid .",
    "viscous stresses are given by the product of the viscosity @xmath51 and the strain rate .",
    "thus , the viscous force on an object of size @xmath52 is approximately @xmath53 where @xmath51 is the viscosity and @xmath54 is a characteristic speed of the flow .",
    "the viscosity of water is @xmath55n - s / m@xmath56 .",
    "the product of mass and acceleration for an element of size @xmath52 of a fluid of density @xmath57 is approximately @xmath58 for micron - sized objects in water moving at speeds of the order of microns per second , the inertial force @xmath59 is about a million times smaller than the viscous force @xmath60 .",
    "this regime is the regime of  low reynolds number , \" in which inertia is irrelevant  @xcite .",
    "thus , we may estimate the viscous drag on the element of the rod of length @xmath49 to be of the order of @xmath61 .",
    "( in  [ sec : curves ] we address the question of how the length scale @xmath43 enters the drag . )",
    "we now have the ingredients required to estimate the relaxation time for longitudinal extension and compression of a filament . assuming that the inertia of the rod as well as the fluid is negligible , we balance the viscous drag with the elastic force , identify @xmath54 with @xmath62 , and drop numerical factors such as @xmath63 to find @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the characteristic relaxation time for longitudinal stretching or compression of a rod of length @xmath14 in a viscous fluid is @xmath65    to estimate the relaxation time for bending deformations , note that the bending modulus @xmath8 for a thin filament of radius @xmath43 is related to the young s modulus by @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "just as we did for membranes , we can describe small deflections of a filament by a height function @xmath67 , and approximate the elastic energy as @xmath68 . by the principle of virtual work ,",
    "the elastic force per unit length due to bending is given by the functional derivative @xmath69 .",
    "once again disregarding numerical factors , we approximate the resistance to transverse motion as @xmath70 , and balance the elastic and viscous forces to obtain the bending relaxation time @xmath71 the ratio of the stretch relaxation time to the bend relaxation time involves two powers of the aspect ratio , @xmath72 .",
    "this aspect ratio is typically very small , ranging from @xmath73 for a 50 nm segment of dna to @xmath74 for a typical bacterial flagellum  @xcite .",
    "therefore , modulations in the extension relax much faster than bending deformations for polymer filaments .",
    "when the focus of interest is bending dynamics , thin filaments are typically assumed to be inextensible    to estimate the relaxation time for twisting deformations , suppose the filament is straight but twisted .",
    "we will precisely define twist for a filament with arbitrary contour in  [ sec : rodkinematics ] , but for a straight filament define the angle @xmath75 through which the cross - section at @xmath44 has rotated due to twist .",
    "the torque applied through a cross - section is @xmath76 , and the net elastic torque on an element of length @xmath49 due to internal stresses is @xmath77 .",
    "the viscous torque resisting rotation at rate @xmath78 is the product of the viscous stress @xmath79 , the surface area of the element @xmath80 , and the moment arm @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the twist degree of freedom obeys the diffusion equation @xmath81 , and the twist relaxation time is @xmath82 for many materials , @xmath83  @xcite , and thus @xmath84 the twist relaxation time is much smaller than the bend relaxation time .",
    "interestingly , the twist relaxation time is comparable to the stretch relaxation time .",
    "nevertheless , it is common to consider the dynamics of inextensible elastic rods with both bending and twisting degrees of freedom , since twisting and stretching are usually driven by different physical processes .",
    "a simple example is provided by an elastic filament , initially straight and twirling about its long axis (  [ illustrative1 ] ) . since the rotation induces twist but no stretching , it is convenient to treat the filament as inextensible .      in this section",
    "we review the basic mechanics of membranes  @xcite .",
    "we confine our attention to fluid membranes , in which there is no long - range order in the molecules making up the membrane .",
    "these membranes wrap up into closed surfaces known as vesicles  liposomes in the case of lipid molecules , and polymersomes in the case of block copolymers  @xcite .",
    "both the lipids and the block copolymers are amphiphilic , consisting of two parts with different affinities for water .",
    "the hydrophobic effect drives the molecules to form a bilayer , with the oily chains with the least affinity for water inside the bilayer .",
    "we now estimate the relaxation time for membrane stretching .",
    "consistent with the discussion of  [ thermalflucts ] , we suppose the membrane is in the  high - tension \" regime of stretching in which the resistance arises from elasticity rather than entropic effects  @xcite . disregarding the bilayer structure for the moment",
    ", we may view the membrane as a two - dimensional fluid .",
    "unlike the filaments we considered in  [ sec : timefilament ] , the membrane is a liquid , and to describe the resistance of the membrane to stretching and compression we use the density rather than a displacement variable .",
    "let @xmath85 denote the number of molecules per unit area , and @xmath86 denote the preferred number density . for small deformations ,",
    "the elastic energy of stretching is @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the compression modulus with units of energy . since the modulus @xmath88 is usually large enough that the density is close to @xmath86 , work in terms of @xmath89 . from dimensional analysis",
    ", we deduce that the two - dimensional pressure in the membrane , with units of force per length , is @xmath90 .",
    "gradients in the two - dimensional pressure lead to tangential forces in the membrane , which drive regions of non - uniform density to relax to constant density .",
    "the balance of these tangential forces with dissipative forces determines the stretch relaxation time .",
    "we consider the relaxation of a density modulation with wavenumber @xmath91 .",
    "first we suppose that the dominant dissipative forces arise from the viscous forces the solvent exerts on the membrane . for a characteristic flow field @xmath54 near the membrane ,",
    "the stress is @xmath92 .",
    "thus the balance of the gradient of pressure with the viscous stress leads to @xmath93 assuming the no - slip boundary condition between the solvent velocity and the lipid velocity holds , we may use @xmath54 to represent the lipid velocity as well .",
    "the rate of change of the density @xmath85 is related to the lipid flow by the continuity equation expressing conservation of particles . in  [",
    "sec : dynamicalequationsmembrane ]",
    "we will see how to formulate the continuity equation on a moving curved surface , but for our scaling argument it is sufficient to assert that @xmath94 , or @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the stretching relaxation time of the membrane . combining eqs .",
    "( [ gpresvstress ] ) and ( [ lipconsscaling ] ) leads to @xmath97 or , taking the smallest wavenumber to be set by the size @xmath14 of the vesicle , @xmath98 .    to estimate the relaxation time for bending deformations with wavenumber @xmath91 , we balance the bending elastic force per unit area with viscous stress or traction from the solvent .",
    "we will give the precise form of the elastic force per area on a deformed membrane in  [ sec : fluidmembrane ] , but working in analogy with our expression for the bending force per unit length on a filament , we have @xmath99 . again invoking the no - slip condition to identify @xmath100 with the velocity in the solvent near the membrane",
    ", we estimate the viscous traction on the membrane as @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the bending relaxation time scale .",
    "balancing the elastic force per area with the traction leads to  @xcite @xmath103 since the smallest @xmath91 scales with vesicle size @xmath14 , we may also write @xmath104 .",
    "a simple scaling estimate for the magnitude of the bending stiffness is @xmath105 , where @xmath30 is a molecular scale such as the thickness of the membrane  @xcite .",
    "thus , the ratio of the stretch relaxation time to the bend relaxation time for membranes scale as @xmath106 , and just as in the case of filaments we expect density modulations to relax much faster than bending modulations . to estimate the time scales directly from the measured parameters for the lipid stearoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine ( sopc ) , we use @xmath107n / m and @xmath108j  @xcite , which yields for a vesicle with @xmath109@xmath2 m a stretch relaxation time of @xmath110s and a bending relaxation time of @xmath111s .",
    "note that the bending relaxation time depends strongly on length scale ; a ripple with a 1@xmath2 m wavelength relaxes 1000 times faster than a ripple with a 10@xmath2 m wavelength .",
    "thus , the time scale for bending dynamics of lipid membranes can easily be of the order of seconds .",
    "in addition to the viscous forces from the solvent , there are two other dissipative forces acting on the membrane : viscous forces due the surface viscosity of the membrane itself , and friction forces arising from the slipping of the two monolayers past each other .",
    "the relative importance of these forces changes with scale , with bilayer friction and then membrane viscosity becoming dominant as the length scale decreases  @xcite .",
    "the implications of bilayer structure , both for dynamics and for morphology , are described in  @xcite and will not be discussed in this review .",
    "however , we will treat intrinsic membrane viscosity , since it is even more important than solvent viscosity in the case of polymersomes .",
    "surface viscosity relates the viscous force per unit _ length _",
    "@xmath112 to the shear rate , @xmath113 .",
    "thus , the ratio of surface and bulk viscosity is a length , @xmath114 , termed the  saffman - delbrck length \"  @xcite in honor of saffman and delbrck s study of the mobility of particles embedded in a thin liquid film atop a deep liquid subphase  @xcite . since the force per unit area acting on an element of membrane",
    "is given by a derivative of the force per length , the surface viscous force per unit area scales as @xmath115 compared to @xmath116 for the traction from the solvent .",
    "therefore , surface viscosity effects become dominant when @xmath117 . surface viscosities for lipid membranes",
    "are of the order of 10@xmath118n@xmath119s / m  @xcite , whereas the surface viscosity of diblock copolymer vesicles can be about 500 times higher  @xcite . therefore , the saffman - delbrck length is @xmath120@xmath2 m for liposomes , and @xmath121 mm for polymersomes . therefore , surface viscosity effects dominate the dynamics of polymersomes .",
    "however , we will see in  [ sec : dynamicalequationsmembrane ] that solvent viscosity can not be neglected in the dynamics of almost flat membranes .",
    "nevertheless , the bending relaxation time for a polymersome may be obtained by the same argument that led to eq .",
    "( [ bendrelaxtime ] ) with @xmath122 replacing @xmath51 , leading to @xmath123 or @xmath124 for a vesicle of size @xmath14 . since surface",
    "viscous stresses will resist the relaxation of both compression and bending modes , the relation @xmath125 still holds for polymersomes .",
    "in this section we derive the equations of motion for flexible filaments in a viscous liquid  @xcite .",
    "we begin with kinematics and review how to compactly describe bending and twisting using a body - fixed frame of directors .",
    "then we use variational arguments to derive the elastic forces per unit length acting on an element of a rod in an arbitrary configuration . after a brief discussion of compatibility relations for rod strain and angular velocity ,",
    "we conclude the section with an overview of the viscous forces acting on slender rods in the overdamped regime of stokes flow .",
    "the centerline of a rod is given by @xmath126 , the position of the point with coordinate @xmath127 .",
    "since @xmath127 is fixed for a given material point , we call @xmath127 a material coordinate .",
    "alternatively , @xmath127 is sometimes called a convected coordinate since the label @xmath127 is carried along with the material point as the body deforms . as mentioned earlier , it is much easier to bend a rod than it is to stretch it .",
    "thus , we consider inextensible rods . note that @xmath127 is a material or convected coordinate ; it is a label for material points of the centerline of the rod .",

    "our characterization of the configuration of a rod is completed by specifying the orientation of the rod cross - section at each @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath134 and @xmath135 lie along the principal directions of the rod cross - section ( see fig .",
    "[ rod_directors ] ) . then define @xmath136 . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider _ unshearable _ rods , for which the cross - section always remains perpendicular to the rod centerline , or @xmath137",
