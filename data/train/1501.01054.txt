    "models involving a black hole surrounded by a hyperaccretion disc have been proposed @xcite as the central engine of grbs .",
    "several authors @xcite , however , suggest that a highly - magnetized , rapidly spinning stable ns ( magnetar ) could form during the coalescence of bnss . the evidence for magnetar formation following some sgrbs is accumulated during the past decade @xcite . in addition",

    "the ejecta from a neutron star merger ( nsm ) are thought to be a pure sample of @xmath1-process material .",

    "the physical picture of this scenario is illustrated in figure fig : schematic .",
    "high opacity of the ejecta is caused by the presence of elements with half - filled @xmath6-shells , such as lanthanides and actinides produced in the @xmath1-process @xcite . as a result of high ( bound - bound ) opacity , optical emission from rs",
    "would be blocked during the early expansion of the ejecta .",
    "early x - ray emission from the rs , on the other hand , would be blocked only by the electron scattering opacity and unaffected by the bound - bound transitions .",

    "inspection of equation @xmath58  indicates that initially @xmath59 , the ejecta will be accelerated linearly in time until @xmath60 , where the deceleration timescale @xmath8is determined by the condition @xmath61  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by setting the spin - down timescale @xmath62",
    ", we will arrive at a critical ejecta mass @xcite@xmath63where @xmath64  is the moment of inertia of the neutron star .",
    "it is this critical mass that defines the three cases considered by @xcite , i.e. , case i for @xmath65 , case ii for @xmath66 , and case iii for @xmath67 .",
    "here we show the corresponding results including rs in figures [ fig : case - i]-fig : case - iii , where the spectral index of electrons in fs is set as @xmath68 , and the luminosity distance of the source is set as @xmath69 . the optical opacity is set as @xmath70 . for more discussions about the dependence of opacity on wavelength , see section [ sec : ion ] . to ease comparison between different choices of dynamics ,",
    "we selectively show in figures [ fig : case - i]a and [ fig : case - i]b as dashed lines the results with the same parameters as the solid lines but with dynamics expressed by equation @xmath71 .    in the above calculations we set the lorentz factor of the unshocked electrons / positrons ( region 4 ) as @xmath72 , as determined in the literature @xcite . the spectral index of @xmath73 in rs is set as @xmath74 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there is an additional complication concerning rs that should be mentioned .",
    "after the shut - off of the central magnetar at @xmath75 , the reverse shock crosses region 4 so that there are no more @xmath73 to be shocked . consequently , the electrons already cooled to a lorentz factor @xmath76 can not be shocked again to a higher lorentz factor . as a result , in the analytical and numerical calculations",
    ", if we find the cooling lorentz factor increases in a time period after @xmath75 , which is the case when @xmath77 for case i , we will set its value the same as before .",
    "we find that the characteristic frequencies of synchrotron radiation of fs are quite similar to that calculated by @xcite so that we do not show them in the figures .",
    "because the rs emission will be absorbed by the ejecta , we show the rs emission with / without absorption in panels ( d ) and ( c ) respectively .",
    "it is in principle possible that a fs and a rs develop in the ejecta upon the interaction with region 3 and region 2 respectively . in practice , however , since the ejecta are very thin , the fs and rs in it can last only for a transient while .",
    "consequently we do not consider them here .    a first glimpse of figure [ fig : case - i]a shows that the evolution of lorentz factor with different choices of dynamics are very similar . however , there are also differences that result in appreciable modification to the evolution of characteristic frequencies ( comparing the solid lines and dashed lines in figure [ fig : case - i]b ) and light curves , which are not shown in figure [ fig : case - i ] .",
    "the reason is that the ejecta absorb some amount of energy , resulting in a heavier ejecta and therefore a delay of the deceleration time @xmath8 by a factor of @xmath78 .",
    "this further results in a drop of @xmath79 ( see figure [ fig : case - i]b ) , which is otherwise identical to the situation where the ejecta do not absorb energy ( comparing the solid lines and dashed lines in figure [ fig : case - i]b ) .",
    "the delay of @xmath8 also strengthens the fs since more ambient media are swept up at @xmath8 .",
    "figure [ fig : case - iii]a shows the coasting of lorentz factor , but not so clear - cut as in figure 4a of gao13 .",
    "although the energy absorption by ejecta has an appreciable effect on the dynamics and therefore the light curves , it is not so significant as for the case of merger - nova discussed by @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that a simple model based on equation @xmath58  and used in @xcite , properly reproduces qualitative features of the more sophisticated one employed here , and therefore the use of this model in wang13b is justified .    for completeness and also for the ease of future quantitative analysis",

    ", we see that the free - free opacity at uv wavelengths is @xmath103 , which is completely negligible .",
    "the free - free opacity at x - ray band is even smaller because of the dependence of opacity on wavelength @xmath104 .",
    "the bound - bound opacities of the lanthanides are a function of both temperature and wavelength @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , the line expansion opacity of cerium ( ce , @xmath105 , @xmath6-shell ) , for example , decreases to the red and sharply drops to zero for @xmath106 ( figure 7 in * ? ? ?",
    "that is , the bound - bound opacity in the uv and x - ray bands is negligible at the temperature we are interested in , i.e. @xmath107 . on the other hand , the planck mean expansion opacity of neodymium ( nd ,",

    "the reason is that , with the increase of temperature , more excited levels are populated .",
    "but if the gas becomes hot enough to ionize , the originally populated state leaves blank and the opacity declines .",

    "accordingly , we estimate @xmath127 for @xmath128 . taking the typical values , we find @xmath129 for @xmath128 .",
    "we therefore conclude that for uv photons , bound - free opacity is dominant . for x - ray ,",
    "@xmath130 , but @xmath117 takes a value several orders of magnitude smaller than it does at the optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "consequently , the bound - free opacity for x - ray is negligible and the opacity at x - ray is dominated by @xmath131 .",
    "although the above reasoning is quite robust , but owing to the complex nature of opacities , it is worth of more scrutiny here .",
    "figure 7 in kasen13 shows that the opacity of osmium ( os , @xmath132 , @xmath133-shell ) is very high at uv wavelengths .",
    "but this high opacity is only for temperature @xmath134 .",

    "consequently we can tentatively infer that the bound - bound opacity of os at temperature @xmath137 is smaller than the bound - free opacity evaluated in the previous paragraph .",
    "another uncertainty comes from actinides ( @xmath138 ) . while the actinide series is generally of very low abundance , but",

    "future gravitational observation of nsms may also help determine the launch time of poynting flux because this time roughly coincides with the merger time .",
    "figure [ fig : ionization ] shows that the ionization break - out time depends on @xmath121  weakly .",
    "thus by timing x - ray , uv , and visual light we can obtain weak constraints on @xmath112  and @xmath200 .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed electromagnetic counterparts in various bands to the binary neutron star merger , and arrived at the following conclusions :    1 .   by assuming that the poynting flux of the central magnetar becomes lepton - dominated so that rs develops , broad - band em signals , i.e. radio , optical , uv , and x - ray emission , can be produced .",
    "the nsm ejecta can be accelerated to relativistic speed so that a forward shock can form .",
    "we therefore expect to observe em signals first from rs and subsequently from fs .",
    "2 .   in the study of the optical and radio radiation of ptf11agg , the simple dynamics , i.e. , equation @xmath58 , was adopted by @xcite . in this paper",
    ", the dynamics is determined by pressure balance and it is found that equation @xmath201 is an acceptable approximation .",
    "3 .   in studying ptf11agg , @xcite ignored the absorption of optical radiation by the ejecta .",
    "we find in this paper , by including the absorption effect , that by the time the first optical datum was taken , the ejecta become optically thin so that the treatment of @xcite is justified .",
    "@xcite also ignored the emission from the ejecta itself , which is verified in this paper ( figure [ fig : case - i ] ) that the emission of the ejecta itself is negligible in all relevant bands .",
    "scattering off free electrons will obscure the early x - ray emission from rs .",
    "optical emission from rs will be suppressed by bound - bound opacity until the ejecta become transparent at later times .",
    "uv radiation from rs , on the other hand , has the right energy to ionize the hot ejecta during its early expansion and ionization breakout should therefore be observed .",
    "5 .   given the weak dependence of arrival times of em signals at different wavelengths on different opacities , we conclude that the timing of x - ray , uv , and optical light is not an accurate method to observationally constrain the opacities of @xmath1-process material . 6 .",
    "recent papers by @xcite and @xcite make an approximation that the merger ejecta is rapidly compressed into a thin expanding shell , similar to the one which forms at grb afterglows . in this paper",
    "we estimate the time it takes for the flux to compress the ejecta to a thin shell and find that the time is negligible compared with the activity duration of the central magnetar . as a result , the models proposed by gao13 and @xcite can be applied safely .",
