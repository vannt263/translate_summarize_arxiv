    "over many years of both theoretical and experimental studies , drell - yan lepton pair production has been considered as one of the most interesting processes in high energy physics . especially , single inclusive drell - yan lepton pair production in p@xmath0 collisions is a cleaner probe than high-@xmath1 hadrons since it has neither final state interactions nor fragmentation effects .",
    "therefore , it provides a unique opportunity to study the parton distributions , especially the unintegrated gluon distributions @xcite , in hadrons .",
    "furthermore , according to the high energy factorization , the hard photon - hadron and drell - yan lepton pair - hadron ( virtual photon - hadron ) correlations in p@xmath0 collisions serve an important role in probing the low-@xmath2 dipole gluon distributions .    in the small-@xmath2 regime @xcite , there exist two distinct unintegrated gluon distributions , namely the weizscker - williams ( ww ) gluon distribution @xcite and the dipole gluon distribution @xcite . according to its operator definition , the ww gluon distribution corresponds to the conventional gluon distribution , which measures the gluon density in the light - cone gauge .",
    "although the dipole gluon distribution has no such interpretation , it is a fundamental quantity which appears in many processes involving hadrons .",
    "the dijet ( or dihadron ) correlations in dis @xcite can help us directly measure the ww gluon distribution which has never been explored experimentally before , while the drell - yan lepton - pair - hadron correlation can directly probe the dipole gluon distribution at small-@xmath2 .",
    "since the virtual photon does not interact with the gluons inside target hadrons , the final state effects are absent . as a result , this correlation can be calculated exactly in the leading order for all angles between the virtual photon and associated jet or hadron @xcite .",
    "in contrast , due to the final state interactions , the so - called correlation limit or back - to - back limit has to be taken in order to arrive at a factorized formula for the dijet or dihadron processes .",
    "previous studies @xcite of the drell - yan processes in pp or p@xmath0 collisions have focused primarily on the inclusive cross sections , but not on the correlations between the outgoing hadron and the drell - yan lepton pair collisions . if we take the virtuality of the photon @xmath3 to be @xmath4 , and subtract the collinear divergence with proper scheme , we can also get the results for the real prompt photon and hadron correlations . ] . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the correlations can reveal more dynamical information about the dense nuclear target and yield the direct measurement of the dipole gluon distribution .",
    "the objective of this paper is to numerically study the correlations between the lepton - pair and associated hadron in the drell - yan process in p@xmath0 collisions .",
    "this provides predictions for the correlations which can be measured at both rhic and lhc @xcite .    to parametrize the dipole gluon distribution , we have employed two approaches . in the first one we used the golec - biernat - wsthoff ( gbw ) model @xcite together with the geometrical scaling @xcite which can successfully describe all the low-@xmath2 dis data . in deep inelastic scattering ,",
    "the partonic cross section for a virtual photon scattering off a proton can be written in the color dipole model as a convolution of the photon wave function and the dipole - proton scattering amplitude . in the gbw model ,",
    "the dipole scattering amplitude is parametrized as @xmath5 $ ] with @xmath6 being the transverse size of the @xmath7 dipole .",
    "the geometrical scaling property means that if one writes @xmath8 with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite , the dis total cross section only depends on one single variable @xmath12 , instead of the variables @xmath2 and @xmath13 separately .",
    "although the geometric scaling was originally found in dis on proton targets , it can be generalized to p@xmath0 collisions as well @xcite .",
    "one can write the saturation momentum scale @xmath14 for target nuclei with mass number @xmath0 as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the profile function which depends on the impact parameter @xmath17 . this profile function is related to the centrality of the p@xmath0 ( or d@xmath0 ) collisions .",
    "central collisions give large values of @xmath16 , while the peripheral collisions correspond to small values of the profile function .    in the second approach",
    ", we numerically solve the small-@xmath2 evolution equation for the dipole amplitude , namely the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite , using both fixed and running couplings . from these numerical solutions we then obtain the dipole gluon distribution in each case .",
    "we will discuss the implementation of this approach later in more detail .",
    "comparing to the dihadron ( or dijet ) correlations in p@xmath0 processes , the drell - yan type correlation contains a unique feature on the away side .",
    "this correlation has a double - peak structure in the away side while other correlation functions exhibit a single peak structure .",
    "this difference comes from the fact that the dipole gluon distribution and the cross section both vanish when the transverse momentum of the gluon goes to zero .",
    "this leads to a vanishing partonic cross section when the produced virtual photon and quark are completely back - to - back . with the fragmentation effect which turns the quark into a pion ( @xmath18 ) , this effect gets smeared a little bit and becomes less visible .",
    "nevertheless , taking into account the fragmentation , we find that the correlation has a minimum at @xmath19 and possesses a two - peak structure .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dijetcorr ] , we discuss the cross section of the drell - yan process with associated hadron in p@xmath0 collisions and define the correlation function by dividing the single inclusive cross section of the dy process .",

    "we impose a transverse momentum cutoff @xmath58 which can be set to match the experimental acceptance .",
    "the upper limits are again determined by requiring that the longitudinal momentum fraction of the initial quark @xmath59 be less than 1",
    ". this would give the lower bound of @xmath31 integrals and upper bounds of momentum integrals .",
    "for the correlation measurement , either the virtual photon or the detected hadron can be the leading particle with larger transverse mass , while the other becomes the associated particle . in the code",
    ", we break the total contributions into two cases : ( 1 ) @xmath60 ; ( 2)@xmath61 which correspond to the region @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "finally , the ratio of these two cross sections defines the drell - yan pair - hadron correlation function @xmath64 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is defined as the azimuthal angle difference between the virtual photon and measured @xmath18 .",
    "the correlation function expresses the probability density for a pion to be emitted at a specific azimuthal angle relative to the virtual photon ( normally the rapidities of these two particles are chosen to be the same ) .",
    "when @xmath67 , that is , when the virtual photon and @xmath18 are almost back - to - back , the dominant contribution to the correlation function @xmath68 comes from the low @xmath69 region of the gluon distribution @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast , the behavior of the correlation function @xmath68 at @xmath71 is mainly determined by the large transverse momentum part of the gluon distribution function @xmath70 .",
    "in addition , as mentioned earlier , the partonic cross section vanishes at @xmath72 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exclusivedsigma ] ) .",
    "the physical interpretation is that the emission of the virtual photon from the quark requires that the quark gets a kick or an impulse in the transverse direction .",
    "since the small-@xmath2 gluons carry very little longitudinal momentum and the virtual photon does not interact with the dense small-@xmath2 gluons from the target nucleus , the quark must change its transverse momentum during the multiple scattering with the gluons in order to radiate the photon .",
    "in other words , if the quark receives no impulse which change its momentum , the virtual photon will remain as part of the quark higher fock state wavefunction , and thus can not be produced in the final state . due to this fact",
    ", we expect that @xmath73 should be a local minimum of the correlation function .",
    "furthermore , there are two symmetrical maxima lying near @xmath73 as @xmath74 increases with @xmath69 and reaches its maximum at @xmath75 . as a result , the correlation should have a unique double - peak structure on the away side .",
    "note that the correlation function at @xmath73 is no longer zero due to the pion fragmentation function .    in terms of the numerical evaluation of the cross sections and",
    ", we use the mstw 2008 nlo parton distributions @xcite for the parton distributions @xmath76 and the dss fragmentation functions @xcite for the fragmentation functions @xmath77 . in the case of the d ",
    "au collisions at rhic , since the parton distributions are only given for protons in ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain the parton distribution for neutrons by using the isospin symmetry , which gives @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the drell - yan cross section involves the so - called normalized dipole gluon distribution @xmath70 , which characterizes the dense gluon distribution in this process in the nucleus in the small-@xmath2 regime . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this function is related to the well - known dipole gluon distribution @xmath80 as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the transverse area of the target nucleus , @xmath83 is the number of colors , and @xmath84 is the strong coupling constant .    as mentioned",
    "previously we have chosen two approaches to parametrize the normalized dipole gluon distribution @xmath70 , namely , the solution of the bk evolution equation @xcite and the gbw model @xcite .",
    "@xmath85 is a fourier transform of the color dipole amplitude in the coordinate space .",
    "the implementation of the solution to the leading order bk equation for the phenomenological use is a little bit troublesome since it gives too fast energy evolution as compared to the experimental data from dis .",
    "the gbw model describes the dis data very well and is straightforward to use",
    ". however the gbw model fails to describe the proper behavior gluon distribution at large transverse momentum since it has an exponential drop off , while the perturbative qcd gives a result which drops in terms of powers of @xmath69 . in practice , we use these two approaches for our numerical evaluation since they are complementary to each other .",
    "our procedure is to fine - tune the behavior of the strong coupling constant @xmath84 or the running coupling @xmath86 in the numerical solution of the bk equation until the solution has the same energy dependence and similar low @xmath69 behavior as what the gbw model gives",
    ". then we believe that the solution of the bk equation should be able to produce the correct large @xmath69 part of the distribution and thus the correct angle correlation at @xmath87 .",

    "the @xmath100 dependence is left implicit .",
    "the normalized dipole gluon distribution @xmath85 at small @xmath2 extracted from the solution to the leading order bk equation yields energy dependence which is too fast as compared with phenomenology .",
    "in addition , the numerical solution to the full nlo bk equation @xcite is not yet ready for use in phenomenological study . in practice ,",
    "we have chosen to modify the solution from the lo bk equation to obtain a realistic energy dependence by varying the behavior of the coupling constant .",
    "for a fixed coupling , we vary the value of the coupling constant directly ; for the running coupling , we vary the value of @xmath101 which controls the running behavior .      we can also parametrize the dipole gluon distributions by using the gbw model adapted for nuclear targets , which has both the nuclear enhancement and geometrical scaling @xcite feature .",
    "the geometrical scaling was found to be related to the traveling wave solutions @xcite of the balitsky - kovchegov evolution .    for a dense proton target ,",

    " pb collisions , we put @xmath156 which corresponds to the full design energy ( @xmath157 pp cm energy ) , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 . for both the rhic and lhc measurement",

    ", we set @xmath160 which means that the virtual photons and pions are produced in the same rapidity window , and use @xmath161 which corresponds to central collisions .",
    "we show our final results for the correlations in figures [ fig : corr_rhic_2 ] and [ fig : corr_lhc_2 ] with different specifically chosen parameters . from figs .",
    "[ fig : corr_rhic_2 ] and [ fig : corr_lhc_2 ] , we find that indeed the gbw model and the bk equation with fixed and running couplings yield similar double - peak structure , as expected from our early discussion for the correlation function at the away side ( @xmath67 ) . however , they differ dramatically at the near side ( @xmath71 ) . it is easy to see that the near side correlation samples the large @xmath69 region of the gluon distribution @xmath70 . since this distribution is slightly greater with the running coupling than with fixed coupling , the near side peak",
    "is somewhat enhanced in the running coupling case .",
    "we believe that the solution to the bk equation gives the correct large @xmath69 behavior for the dipole gluon distribution while the gbw model fails at large @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , we expect that the curves generated by the numeric solution of the bk equation predicts the correlation for rhic and lhc measurement for all azimuthal angle including both the near side and the away side .",
    "in this paper , by using the gbw model and the numerical solution to the bk equation , we have numerically studied the correlations between the lepton - pair and associated hadron in drell - yan processes in p@xmath0 collisions , which directly probe the dipole gluon distributions .",
    "the correlations have been computed for both rhic d  au collisions and lhc p  pb collisions .",
    "we find that the drell - yan type correlation implies a strong suppression of the away side hadron at forward rapidity due to strong interaction between the forward quark from the projectile proton and the dense gluon from the target nucleus .",
    "in addition , we also emphasize that the drell - yan type correlation exhibits a unique double - peak structure in the away side .",
