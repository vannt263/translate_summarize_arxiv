    "large magnetic fields @xmath0 @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electron mass and charge , respectively ) in the surface of stellar objects identified as neutron stars @xcite might provide physical scenarios where quantum processes predicted in such a regime could become relevant for astrophysics and cosmology . according to quantum electrodynamics(qed ) in strong background fields , the most important effects are likely to be pair creation @xcite , photon splitting @xcite and photon capture @xcite . the last two essentially depend on the drastic departure of the photon dispersion relation from the light cone curve , due to the vacuum polarization tensor @xmath4 which depends on both the landau levels of virtual electron - positron pair , as well as on the external magnetic field . as a result ,",
    "the issue of light propagation in empty space , in the presence of @xmath5 is similar to the dispersion of light in an anisotropic `` medium '' , with the preferred direction corresponding to the external field axis .",
    "the phenomenological aspects associated with this issue has been studied for a long time and recently , the effects of the vacuum polarization tensor on the coulomb potential in superstrong magnetic field have been considered as well @xcite .",
    "however , the problem concerning the magnetism carried by a photon has not attracted sufficient attention , excepting @xcite , where an photon anomalous magnetic moment has been pointed out .",
    "the authors of this reference attempted to derive this quantity in two different regimes of the vacuum polarization tensor . on the one hand for low energies in weak fields ( @xmath6 ) and on the other hand (",
    "originally studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) near the first pair creation threshold and for a moderate fields @xmath7 . however , it was ignored that the photon magnetic moment @xmath8 actually is a vector defined as the coefficient of @xmath9 when the energy is linearly approximated in term of the external magnetic field . in consequence",
    ", neither any discussion about the connection between this quantity and its angular momentum was presented nor any comment about its precession around the external field axis was made .    in the present work",
    "we reveal the asymptotic conditions where the concept of a photon anomalous magnetic moment may be adequate .",
    "we will analyze the cases of superstrong magnetic fields ( @xmath10 ) for both the low and the high energy limit of the vacuum polarization tensor . in these domains ,",
    "one eigenvalue of @xmath4 depends linearly on the external field . in consequence ,",
    "the maxwell equations in the `` medium '' seem to describe a massless particle with a magnetic moment . in this case",
    "@xmath8 may become a characteristic quantity since the external field generates a lorentz symmetry break down which induces the nonconservation of the photon helicity .",
    "we shall see that this notion equips us with an intuitive tool to understand , in a phenomenological way , the quasiparticle behavior of a photon propagation mode in a highly magnetized vacuum .",
    "the second purpose of this work is to show that virtual photons are a source of magnetization to the whole vacuum .",
    "we will address the question in which way the virtual electromagnetic radiation contributes to a measurement of the vacuum magnetization and therefore to increase the external field strength .",
    "this aspect might be important for astrophysics since the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in compact stellar objects remains poorly understood @xcite .",
    "some investigations in this area provide theoretical evidences that @xmath11 is self - consistent due to the bose - einstein condensation of charged and neutral boson gases in a superstrong magnetic field @xcite . in this context",
    ", the nonlinear qed - vacuum possesses the properties of a paramagnetic medium and seems to play an important role within the process of magnetization in the stars .",
    "its properties have been studied also in @xcite for weak ( @xmath12 ) and moderate fields ( @xmath13 ) in one - loop approximation of the euler - heisenberg lagrangian @xcite .",
    "new corrections emerge by considering the two - loop term of this effective lagrangian @xcite which contains the contribution of virtual photons created and annihilated spontaneously in the vacuum and interacting with the external field through the vacuum polarization tensor .",
    "the two - loop term of the euler - heisenberg lagragian was computed many years ago by ritus @xcite .",
    "a few years latter , dittrich and reuter @xcite obtained a simpler integral representation of this term and showed that their results agreed with those determined by ritus in the strong magnetic field limit . in the last few years , it has been recalculated by several authors using the worldline formalism @xcite and it has been extended to the case of finite temperature as well @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in all these works it is really cumbersome to discern the individual contributions given by each virtual photon propagation mode to the euler - heisenberg lagrangian which should allow to determine the global magnetic character generated by each of them . in this paper",
    "we compute these contributions separately .",
    "in addition we derive the individual vacuum magnetizations provided by each virtual photon propagation mode for very large magnetic fields @xmath14 .",
    "whilst the complete two - loop contribution is purely paramagnetic we find a diamagnetic response coming from that @xmath15eigenvalue which is used to obtain the photon anomalous magnetic moment .    in order to expose our results",

    "the posibility to define a photon anomalous magnetic moment in an asymptotically large magnetic field is studied in sect .",
    "iv . we shall show that @xmath8 turns out to be a vector with two orthogonal components in correspondence with the cylindrical symmetry imposed by the external field .",
    "moreover , we will see that a nonvanishing torque exerted by @xmath16 might generates a precession of @xmath8 which is a manifestation of the reduction of the rotation symmetry and , consequently lorentz symmetry . in sect .",
