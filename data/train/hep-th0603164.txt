    "in the last few years the quantum liouville theory attracted again a considerable attention , mainly for its application in describing d - brane dynamics in non - compact curved or time dependent backgrounds ( for review and references see @xcite ) .",
    "this renewed interest was supported by a recent progress in the quantum liouville theory on bordered surfaces , where exact analytic forms of all basic correlators were derived @xcite by powerful conformal bootstrap methods .",
    "these methods were previously successfully applied in rederiving @xcite the dozz bulk three point function @xcite and proving its consistency @xcite .    in the case of the dozz",
    "three point function on the sphere the exact result agrees with the perturbative calculations @xcite based on the hamiltonian approach @xcite .",
    "a perturbative check of the exact formula for the one point function on the pseudosphere was given in @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the bootstrap solution should have a well defined path integral representation . in all the cases in which a classical solution exists one",
    "then could expect that the quantum expressions arise as a result of integrating fluctuations of classical background geometries .    in the case of `` heavy '' elliptic weights on compact surfaces a systematic functional formulation of liouville theory",
    "was first proposed long time ago by takhtajan @xcite ( see @xcite for recent generalizations ) .",
    "this so called geometric approach has been recently compared with the exact bootstrap solution on the pseudosphere @xcite .",
    "it was shown in particular that the choice of regularization is crucial for the agreement with the bootstrap approach . recently a functional representation of liouville correlators with heavy elliptic charges on the sphere @xcite , the pseudosphere @xcite , and the disc @xcite has been developed .",
    "this representation agrees with the bootstrap solution at least up to one loop calculations .    in the present paper",
    "we address the problem of calculating the classical limit of the fzzt liouville theory for heavy charges .",
    "our motivation is twofold . in spite of the recent progress in constructing the path integral representation of liouville correlators for elliptic weights there is still an open and interesting problem of factorization in functional approach . due to the global character of the liouville action related to its specific dependence on the background metric",
    "it is not simply described by the standard cutting - open procedure .",
    "it seems that in order to handle this problem one should first construct a functional representations for liouville correlators with hyperbolic weights .",
    "the fzzt theory provides simple cases where exact solutions are known and both problems can be relatively easily analyzed .",
    "the classical limit is just the first step of such calculations .",
    "the second , probably more important motivation is the semiclassical limit itself .",
    "it turned out that analyzing the quantum liouville theory in this limit one gets essentially new insight into the classical hyperbolic geometry .",
    "one of the first results of this type was the so called polyakov conjecture , originally obtained as a classical limit of the ward identity and proved latter as an exact theorem @xcite .",
    "it says that the classical liouville action is a generating function for the accessory parameters of the fuchsian uniformization of the punctured sphere .",
    "more intriguing results are related with the classical conformal block @xmath0(x),$ ] defined by the classical limit of the bpz quantum conformal block @xcite with heavy weights @xmath1 @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath3",
    "\\!(x ) \\ ; \\sim \\ ; \\exp \\left\\ { q^2\\,f_{\\delta } \\!\\left[_{\\delta_{4}\\;\\delta_{1}}^{\\delta_{3}\\;\\delta_{2}}\\right ] \\!(x ) \\right\\}.\\ ] ] it was argued in @xcite that the 4-point liouville classical action can be expressed in terms of 3-point actions and the classical conformal block in a given channel calculated for a saddle point value of the intermediate weight .",
    "since there are three different decompositions of the 4-point action one gets consistency conditions called the classical bootstrap equations @xcite .",
    "it was also conjectured @xcite that the saddle point weight is closely related to the length of the closed geodesic in the corresponding channel .",
    "these statements are far from being proved in a rigorous way , but there are many nontrivial numerical checks instead @xcite .",
    "let us finally stress that once the 4-point liouville action is known one can in principle calculate the uniformization of the 4-punctured sphere @xcite , which is a long standing open mathematical problem .",
    "analyzing various classical limits one may hope to gain some new information on the classical conformal block , which up to now is only available through term by term symbolic calculations from the limit ( [ defccb ] ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sect .  2 , following the ideas of @xcite",
    ", we formulate the @xmath4-monodromy problem with boundary . in sect .",
    "3 we introduce an appropriate classical liouville action and derive the formulae for its partial derivatives with respect to bulk and boundary conformal weights , and bulk and boundary cosmological constants .",
    "a novel technical result is the formula for the partial derivative of the action with respect to the ratio @xmath5 in terms of special values of some conformal map .",
    "details of its derivation are explained in the appendix .    in sect .",
    "4 we present a proof of the polyakov conjecture for elliptic boundary weights and arbitrary bulk weights .",
    "this extends the previous results @xcite to the fzzt liouville theory and is one of the main results of this paper .",
    "the last section contains four examples of explicit calculations of the classical actions both from classical solutions and from the classical limit of exact quantum expressions .",
    "the simplest one is the case of one bulk elliptic singularity considered in subsect .  5.1 .",
    "the case of one bulk hyperbolic singularity is considered in subsect .",
    "this calculations provide an additional support for the construction of the classical action for hyperbolic singularities proposed and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the cases of two boundary , and one bulk one boundary elliptic weights are calculated in subsect .",
    "5.3 and subsect .  5.4 , respectively . both ways of calculation the classical liouville action are rather complicated in these cases .",
    "the full agreement of the results provides an additional strong evidence that the classical limit of the dozz bootstrap solution exists and is properly described by a classical action satisfying the equations derived in sect .  3 and 4 .",
