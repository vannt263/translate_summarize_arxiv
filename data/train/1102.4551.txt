    "the magnetization dynamics that is relevant for the performance of any type of magnetic device is in general governed by damping . in most cases the magnetization dynamics",
    "can be modeled successfully by means of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation @xcite that accounts for damping in a phenomenological way . the possibility to calculate",
    "the corresponding damping parameter from first principles would open the perspective of optimizing materials for devices and has therefore motivated extensive theoretical work in the past .",
    "this led among others to kambersky s breathing fermi surface ( bfs ) @xcite and torque - correlation model ( tcm ) @xcite , that in principle provide a firm basis for numerical investigations based on electronic structure calculations @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling that is seen as a key factor in transferring energy from the magnetization to the electronic degrees of freedom is explicitly included in these models .",
    "most ab - initio results have been obtained for the bfs model though the torque - correlation model makes fewer approximations @xcite . in particular , it in principle describes the physical processes responsible for gilbert damping over a wide range of temperatures as well as chemical ( alloy ) disorder .",
    "however , in practice , like many other models it depends on a relaxation time parameter @xmath3 that describes the rate of transfer due to the various types of possible scattering mechanisms .",
    "this weak point could be removed recently by brataas et al .",
    "@xcite who described the gilbert damping by means of scattering theory .",
    "this development supplied the formal basis for the first parameter - free investigations on disordered alloys for which the dominant scattering mechanism is potential scattering caused by chemical disorder @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by brataas et al .",
    "@xcite , their approach is completely equivalent to a formulation in terms of the linear response or kubo formalism .",
    "the latter route is taken in this communication that presents a kubo - greenwood - like expression for the gilbert damping parameter .",
    "application of the scheme to disordered alloys demonstrates that this approach is indeed fully equivalent to the scattering theory formulation of brataas et al .",
    "in addition a scheme is introduced to deal with the temperature dependence of the gilbert damping parameter .",
    "following brataas et al .",
    "@xcite , the starting point of our scheme is the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation for the time derivative of the magnetization @xmath4 : @xmath5 \\ ; , \\label{llg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the saturation magnetization , @xmath7 the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath8 the gilbert damping tensor .",

    ", one gets an explicit expression for the gilbert damping tensor @xmath8 or equivalently for the damping parameter @xmath21 : @xmath22 an efficient way to deal with eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) is achieved by expressing the sum over the eigenstates by means of the retarded single - particle green s function @xmath23 .",
    "this leads for the parameter @xmath24 to a kubo - greenwood - like equation : @xmath25 with @xmath26 indicating a configurational average in case of a disordered system ( see below ) .",
    "identifying @xmath27 with the magnetic torque @xmath28 this expression obviously gives the parameter @xmath19 in terms of a torque - torque correlation function .",
    "however , in contrast to the conventional tcm the electronic structure is not represented in terms of bloch states but using the retarded electronic green function giving the present approach much more flexibility .",
    "as it corresponds one - to - one to the standard kubo - greenwood equation for the electrical conductivity , the techniques developed to calculate conductivities can be straightforwardly adopted to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ alpha2 ] ) .",
    "the most reliable way to account for spin - orbit coupling as the source of gilbert damping is to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ alpha2 ] ) using a fully relativistic hamiltonian within the framework of local spin density formalism ( lsda ) @xcite : @xmath29 here @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the standard dirac matrices and @xmath32 is the relativistic momentum operator @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the spin - averaged and spin - dependent parts respectively of the lsda potential .",

    "the four component wave functions @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) are regular ( irregular ) solutions to the single - site dirac equation for site @xmath40 and @xmath45 is the so - called scattering path operator that transfers an electronic wave coming in at site @xmath46 into a wave going out from site @xmath47 with all possible intermediate scattering events accounted for coherently .",

    "this can be done by describing in a first step the underlying electronic structure ( for @xmath58  k ) on the basis of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) alloy theory . in the next step the configurational average in eq .",
    "( [ alpha2 ] ) is taken following the scheme worked out by butler @xcite when dealing with the electrical conducting at @xmath58  k or residual resistivity respectively , of disordered alloys .",
    "this implies in particular that so - called vertex corrections of the type @xmath59 that account for scattering - in processes in the language of the boltzmann transport formalism are properly accounted for .",
    "thermal vibrations as a source of electron scattering can in principle be accounted for by a generalization of eqs .",
    "( [ alpha2 ] )  ( [ matrix - element ] ) to finite temperatures and by including the electron - phonon self - energy @xmath60",
    "when calculating the greens function @xmath61 . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to elastic scattering processes by using a quasi - static representation of the thermal displacements of the atoms from their equilibrium positions .",

    "the approach described above has been applied to the ferromagnetic 3d - transition metal alloy systems bcc fe@xmath1co@xmath2 , fcc fe@xmath1ni@xmath2 and fcc co@xmath1ni@xmath2 .",

    "an indispensable requirement to achieve this agreement is to include the vertex corrections mentioned above .",
    "in fact , ignoring them leads in some cases to completely unphysical results . to check the reliability of the standard cpa , that implies a single - site approximation when performing the configurational average , we performed calculations on the basis of the non - local cpa @xcite . in this case four atom cluster",
    "have been used leading - apart from the very dilute case - practically to the same results as the cpa .",
    "as found before for fcc fe@xmath1ni@xmath2 @xcite the theoretical results for @xmath0 reproduce the concentration dependence of the experimental data quite well but are found too low ( see below ) . as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ alpha_mst ] ) the variation of @xmath72 with concentration @xmath73 may reflect to some extent the variation of the average magnetic moment @xmath74 of alloy .",
    "as the moments as well as the spin - orbit coupling strength of fe and co do nt differ too much , the variation of @xmath72 should be determined in the concentrated regime primarily by the electronic structure at the fermi energy @xmath54 . as fig .",
    "[ fig - feni ] shows , there is indeed a close correlation of the density of states @xmath75 that may be seen as a measure for the available relaxation channels .",
    "while the scattering and linear response approach are completely equivalent when dealing with bulk alloys the latter allows us to perform the necessary configuration averaging in a much more efficient way .",
    "this allows us to study with moderate effort the influence of varying the alloy composition on the damping parameter @xmath19 .",
    "corresponding work has been done in particular using permalloy as a starting material and adding transition metals ( tm ) @xcite or rare earth metals @xcite .",

    "as found by experiment @xcite @xmath24 increases in all cases nearly linearly with the 5d tm content .",
    "the total damping for 10 % 5d tm content shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - py5d ] varies roughly parabolically over the 5d tm series .",
    "in contrast to the fe@xmath1co@xmath2 alloys considered above , there is now an s - like variation of the moments @xmath79 over the series ( fig .",
    "[ fig - py5d ] , bottom ) , characteristic of 5d impurities in the pure hosts fe and ni @xcite . in spite of this behaviour of @xmath79",
    "the variation of @xmath72 seems again to be correlated with the density of states @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - py5d ] bottom ) . again",
    "the trend of the experimental data is well reproduced by the theoretical ones that are however somewhat too low .",
    "one of the possible reasons for the discrepancy of the theoretical and experimental results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - feni ] and [ fig - py5d ] might be the neglect of the influence of finite temperatures .",
    "this can be incorporated as indicated above by accounting for the thermal displacement of the atoms in a quasi - static way and performing a configurational average over the displacements using the cpa .",
    "this leads even for pure systems to a scattering mechanism and this way to a finite value for @xmath19 .",
    "corresponding results for pure ni are given in fig .",
    "[ fig - ni ] that show in full accordance with experiment a rapid decrease of @xmath24 with increasing temperature until a regime with a weak variation of @xmath0 with @xmath81 is reached .",
    "this behavior is commonly interpreted as a transition from conductivity - like to resistivity - like behaviour reflecting the dominance of intra- and inter - band transition , respectively @xcite , that is related to the increase of the broadening of electron energy bands caused by the increase of scattering events with temperature . adding only less than 1 at .",
    "% cu to ni , the conductivity - like behavior at low temperatures is strongly reduced while the high temperature behavior is hardly changed .",
    "a further increase of the cu content leads to the impurity - scattering processes responsible for the band broadening dominating @xmath0 .",
    "this effect completely suppresses the conductivity - like behavior in the low - temperature regime because of the increase of scattering events due to chemical disorder .",
    "again this is fully in line with the experimental data , providing a straightforward explanation for their peculiar variation with temperature and composition .    from the results obtained for",
    "ni one may conclude that thermal lattice displacements are only partly responsible for the finding that the damping parameters obtained for py doped with the @xmath78 tm series , and fe@xmath1co@xmath2 are somewhat low compared with experiment .",
    "this indicates that additional relaxation mechanisms like magnon scattering contribute .",
    "again , these can be included at least in a quasi - static way by adopting the point of view of a disordered local moment picture .",
    "this implies scattering due to random temperature - dependent fluctuations of the spin moments that can also be dealt with using the cpa .    in summary ,",
    "a formulation for the gilbert damping parameter @xmath19 in terms of a torque - torque - correlation function was derived that led to a kubo - greenwood - like equation .",
