    "subsurface flows in heterogenous media @xcite , that is , where the heterogeneity varies over a wide range of scales , are examples of multiscale problems . numerical solutions of such problems are often affected by the heterogeneity , in particular when it is highly varying , that is , the permeability of the media can span a large scale . in this paper",
    "we consider the numerical solution of flow problems governed by elliptic equations with highly varying coefficients .",
    "domain decomposition methods use both fine scale and coarse scale subproblems as well as interpolation operators from the subspaces to the solution space to construct preconditioners for the original problem .",
    "the convergence property is linked to proper treatment of the jumps in the coefficients @xcite . a key point when building such domain decomposition methods is to find a good coarse problem that can capture relevant small scale information from the fine level . in general ,",
    "due to the complex geometry of the conductivity field , where high and low conductivity regions often appear as small inclusions inside subdomains and long channels across subdomain boundaries , it is rather difficult to design a robust domain decomposition method for such problems . + when considering high conductivity regions ( inclusions or channels ) in a low conductivity background , the authors of @xcite used functions that are discrete harmonic in each coarse grid block with special boundary values as coarse basis functions ( multiscale basis functions ) .",
    "they introduced two indicators , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the coefficient representing the conductivity , to capture the effect of the jumps in @xmath2 on the condition number .",
    "the indicator @xmath0 measures",
    "how well the coarse partitioning of the whole domain @xmath3 is , as for instance , @xmath0 behaves well as long as the high conductivity regions ( inclusions ) do not cross any subdomain boundaries , and badly otherwise .",
    "the indicator @xmath1 is a measure for the weighted energy norm of the coarse basis functions , and it depends on the choice of boundary conditions , as for instance , an oscillatory boundary condition is often needed in order to keep the energy norm low , consequently for @xmath1 to behave well .",
    "the authors in @xcite used the traditional @xmath4 projection operator from the fine space to the coarse space , and proved that the condition number bound is independent of the jumps .",
    "this approach assumes that the conductivity coefficient is continuous across coarse grid boundaries , although their numerical results did not seem to require this . recently , in @xcite , the authors proposed an overlapping domain decomposition method for the multiscale problem .",
    "the idea of their method is based on the fact that high conductivity regions correspond to the smallest eigenvalues of the system .",
    "consequently , they used the corresponding eigenfunctions as coarse basis functions , and proved a weighted poincar inequality resulting in a condition number bound independent of the jumps .",
    "they also proposed an overlapping domain decomposition methods for the schur complement system .",
    "+ discontinuous galerkin methods may offer several important and valuable computational advantages over their conforming galerkin counterparts .",
    "the finite element spaces are not subject to inter - element continuity conditions , and the local element spaces can be defined independently .",
    "this makes discontinuous galerkin methods well suited for their applications to multiscale problems with piecewise constant coefficients relative to a fine triangulation .",
    "a domain decomposition method for the discontinuous galerkin formulation of a multiscale elliptic problem has recently been proposed in @xcite .",
    "there a composite discontinuous galerkin formulation , that is , a regular continuous formulation inside each subdomain and a discontinuous galerkin formulation across the subdomain boundaries , has been used . there the coarse space consists of piecewise constant basis functions over the coarse partition . the condition number bound of this method",
    "is shown to be @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the maximum and the minimum of the coefficients inside a boundary layer of the subdomain @xmath8 @xmath9 is the diameter of @xmath8 @xmath10 is the fine mesh size in @xmath8 and @xmath11 , the harmonic average of @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "we note that the condition number bound above depends on the jump of the coefficients inside the boundary layer of each subdomain .",
    "+ the present work is an extension of the work in @xcite to a discontinuous galerkin formulation .",
    "we use the same bilinear form as the one given in @xcite with harmonic average weight functions , defined on the fine space which is the space of piecewise linear polynomials with respect to the fine triangulation . a composite discontinuous galerkin formulation , c.f . , @xcite ,",
    "is used on the coarse space whose basis functions are the multiscale basis functions given by the oscillatory boundary conditions , c.f .",
    "we present both a nonoverlapping and an overlapping method . +",
    "a new indicator @xmath13 is introduced measuring the @xmath4 norm of the jump of the coarse basis functions across coarse grid boundaries ( see ( [ eq : beta ] ) ) .",
    "we show that , under certain assumptions , slightly weaker than in @xcite , our methods are robust . for the nonoverlapping case ,",
    "we show that the condition number bound is @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the harmonic average weight function ( see ( [ eq : weight ] ) ) , @xmath1 and @xmath13 are the indicators , and @xmath16 is a penalty parameter .",
    "the numerical experiments support the assumption that this bound is sharp .",
    "however , due to the presence of @xmath15 in the bound , the method may have a large condition number when high conductivity channels cross subdomain boundaries .",
    "note that , this is the case for ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) even when there are no channels crossing subdomain boundaries .",
    "the situation gets improved in the overlapping case .",
    "we show that , for the overlapping method , the condition number bound is @xmath17 the rest of the paper is organized as the following . in section 2 , we introduce our model problem and the discontinuous galerkin discrete formulation .",
    "the two level additive schwarz domain decomposition methods , first the nonoverlapping and then the overlapping version , are defined and analyzed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the numerical results .",
    "throughout this paper , we adopt standard notations from the lebesgue and sobolev space theory ( see @xcite ) .",
