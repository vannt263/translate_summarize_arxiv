    "questions about the nature of chemical reactions , why and how they proceed and how this can be used to form certain desired chemical products are already very old .",
    "in fact they are older than most other of the current research topics in atomic and molecular physics or physical chemistry .",
    "the efforts to answer these questions have lead to numerous achievements over the centuries , starting maybe with the re - discovery of the discreet atomic structure of matter , leading to the invention of chemical catalysis , and including the understanding of the quantum mechanical nature of the chemical bond .",
    "several technological advances have fertilised experimental research on the dynamics of chemical reactions . besides the development of versatile tunable laser source , one notes supersonic single and crossed molecular beams @xcite , multi - dimensional momentum imaging and coincidence detection @xcite , ultrafast time - resolved spectroscopy @xcite , and , most recently",
    ", the preparation of cold and ultracold atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "today the study of the reaction dynamics of molecules has advanced to precise quantum - state resolved scattering experiments in quantitative agreement with high - level scattering calculations  at least for reactive complexes that involve no more than four atoms .",
    "if more atoms contribute to a chemical reaction the dimensionality of the scattering process , i.  e.  the number of degrees of freedom , increases beyond what quantum scattering calculations can do on current computers . also experiments are challenged by the growing complexity , because individual quantum states are increasingly difficult to separate in the initial as well as the final state of a scattering event .",
    "however , it is precisely this `` complexity limit '' in chemical dynamics that is driving a lot of research , because one would like to understand the details of reactions that are of relevance in organic chemistry , in living cells , or in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "in such many - atom reactions new phenomena may occur that lead to different reaction mechanisms than in triatomic reactions .    within the large field of reaction dynamics",
    "an important division follows the electric charge of the collision partners that participate in the reaction . besides the neutral - neutral reaction processes ,",
    "the second largest class are ion - molecule reactions . as will be shown later , the much stronger ion - neutral interaction than the neutral - neutral van - der - waals interaction leads to qualitatively different behaviour .",
    "ion - molecule reactions have often very high rate coefficients and are thus important as soon as ions are present in an environment .",
    "these environments include discharge plasmas @xcite , combustion processes , the earth s ionosphere @xcite , and many other stellar and interstellar regions @xcite .",
    "also in the condensed phase , more specifically in liquid solutions , ion - molecule reactions are important .",
    "reactions of ions are consequently studied almost as long as neutral - neutral reactions .",
    "they require , however , significantly different experimental techniques .",
    "a large portion of the research on ion - molecule reactions is devoted to positively charged ions . in dilute plasmas , ionisation by electron impact or by radiation will directly lead to the formation of cations and they should therefore play an important role there . nevertheless , also negatively charged ions are important constituents of gas phase environments , for example in the lower ionosphere of the earth . here",
    "the negative charge density is mostly represented by atomic and molecular anions ( such as o@xmath0 , o@xmath1 , oh@xmath0 , hco@xmath2 , no@xmath1 and their clusters with water molecules ) and not by free electrons @xcite .",
    "similarly negative ions are omnipresent in liquid solutions and have a strong impact on reactions there .",
    "furthermore , negative ions are precursors for solvated electrons in liquids , which are responsible for strong optical absorption and have been the subject of many studies .    in recent years",
    "negative ions have also been detected in other planetary atmospheres in our solar system , such as the atmosphere of saturn s satellite titan , and they have been found in the interstellar medium , in the dark molecular cloud tmc-1 and in a circumstellar shell around the carbon rich star irc+10216 @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the complex chemistry that leads to anions in these areas is still fragmentary .",
    "the questions here are not only related to the formation of the anions , but also if they can add new formation pathways to the complex neutral molecules found in the interstellar medium , such as long unsaturated carbon chains or possibly polyaromatic hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "the study of the reaction dynamics of anion - molecule reactions are the topic of this review .",
    "comparisons with cation - molecule reactions will be made if suitable .",
    "chemical reactions of negative ions have been studied extensively for many decades .",
    "several excellent reviews have appeared a few years ago on this topic @xcite . here",
    ", we will concentrate specifically on the reaction dynamics in contrast to the mere kinetics of anion - molecule reactions . ``",
    "molecular reaction dynamics is the study of elementary processes [ of molecular collisions ] and the means of probing them , understanding them and controlling them . ''",
    "@xcite . in this sense",
    "we focus on processes where isolated molecules collide in a well - controlled reactive event with a negative ion .",
    "we give an overview over all the major experimental techniques that are used to study anion - molecule reaction dynamics .",
    "in particular , we include the recent experimental developments , on the one hand cryogenic ion traps and on the other hand ion - molecule crossed - beam imaging , and show how they provide new insights .",
    "negative ions are also subject to spectroscopic studies in the infrared and optical range , using bound - bound absorption and bound - free photoelectron spectroscopy .",
    "this reveals the stability , i.  e.  the electron affinity of the neutral , as well as structural information about the anion . since negative ions are still today challenging for quantum chemical calculations , due to the spatial extension of the wavefunction of the excess electron and its interaction with the atomic core , spectroscopy and detachment studies can provide benchmark data @xcite .",
    "photoelectron spectroscopy of negative ions can also reveal the energy level structure of the neutral system that is reached after photodetaching the excess electron .",
    "if the neutral system is not a bound molecule , but a reactive complex , such as for the fh@xmath1 anion , one can even study neutral reactions near the transition state between reactants and products @xcite .",
    "for more information on the spectroscopy of negative ions see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this article will start with the discussion of a few general considerations of anion - molecule collisions and reactions in the next section .",
    "then it will be discussed how measurements of integral cross sections or total rate coefficients , respectively , are performed .",
    "they are carried out either at a given collision energy or a given sample temperature and can already be used to infer information on the underlying reaction dynamics . in the next section , experimental approaches are discussed that allow the investigation of the transient reaction complex . then in section [ crossed - beams : sect ] experiments with crossed beams are presented , which allow the determination of energy- and angle - differential cross sections , under optimum conditions even quantum - state resolved . from these measurements a wealth of information about the collision and reaction dynamics can be extracted . in the final section some of the future directions for the study of anion - molecule reaction dynamics are highlighted .",
    "the understanding of the dynamics of an anion - molecule reaction starts with the description of the interaction potential , usually in the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "the long - range and short - range properties of the interaction potential are discussed in the next sections .",
    "the proper theoretical treatment of the dynamics of the colliding molecules and ions on the interaction potential is a quantum scattering calculation @xcite , which is usually , however , limited to a reduced set of dimensions by the computational effort .",
    "alternatively , the atomic motion is treated with classical dynamics @xcite , which is generally a good assumption because of the small de - broglie wavelength of the atoms . in this case",
    "all dimensions can be included , but such effects as the zero - point motion , tunnelling through potential barriers or quantum scattering resonances can usually not be accounted for .      at large distances the force between an ion and a neutral molecule is determined by the electrostatic interaction potential of the ion with the induced , and possibly also permanent , electric dipole moment of the molecule .",
    "@xmath4 is the orientationally averaged polarisability and @xmath5 the permanent dipole moment of the neutral molecule .",
    "@xmath6 is the charge of the colliding ion . in certain cases also",
    "the ion - quadrupole interaction and other higher order multipole terms need to be added .    if the molecule carries a permanent dipole moment its interaction with the charge , which scales as @xmath7 typically dominates over the induced - dipole interaction , which scales as @xmath8",
    ". however , at large relative separation the free rotation of the molecule leads to a vanishing time - averaged permanent dipole moment . at the largest inter - atomic distances",
    "the ion - induced dipole interaction is therefore most important , which is always attractive .",
    "once the interaction potential then becomes comparable to the rotational energy `` locking '' of the permanent molecular dipole to the incoming ion may occur and will thereby enhance the attractive interaction .        at short distances the electronic wavefunctions of the ion and the molecule",
    "determining the short range interaction potential therefore requires solving the schrdinger equation for the collision system .",
    "this is often particularly difficult for negative ions , because the excess electron is so delocalized that a large basis set is required in the numerical solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "however , it works as an advantage that many negative ions of interest are `` closed - shell '' systems with a spin singlet configuration of the electronic wavefunction , because these are the most stable negative ions with respect to electron detachment . as a consequence ,",
    "only a single born - oppenheimer potential hypersurface governs the reactions of such negative ions with closed - shell neutral molecules .    for many negative ion - neutral collision systems",
    "a repulsive potential is obtained at very short range .",
    "this may be attributed to the electron - electron repulsion by electrostatic forces and the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "together with the strong attractive interaction this leads to potential energy landscapes with two characteristic minima along the reaction coordinate , as shown in fig .",
    "[ reaction - pot : fig ] .",
    "the path along the reaction coordinate is defined as the path of minimum potential energy that connects the reactants with the products .",
    "the potential energy minima typically lie several hundred mev below the asymptotic energies .",
    "consequently , substantial short - range energy barriers may have negative transition state energies , as shown in fig.[reaction - pot : fig ] .",
    "but even if the transition state energy is negative , it can have a profound influence on the reactivity as we will see in the next paragraph .",
    "this is in contrasts to most reactions of cations , because there is usually no or at least no substantial short - range barrier .",
    "the kinetics of a chemical reaction , which describes the rate at which products are formed as a function of time , is usually characterised by the reaction rate coefficient . for a bimolecular reaction that occurs in a collision of two species",
    "the second order rate equation @xmath9 describes the time - dependent increase of the product particle density @xmath10 for given reactant densities @xmath11 .",
    "this equation is typically applied to thermal ensembles .",
    "the second order rate coefficient @xmath12 is then dependent on the absolute temperature @xmath13 .",
    "it is related to the scattering cross section @xmath14 for the individual collision events , which depends on the relative velocity , by the thermal average @xmath15 @xmath16 is the thermal probability distribution for the relative velocities at the absolute temperature @xmath13 .",
    "the standard model to estimate collision rates of ions with neutral atoms or molecules is the langevin or capture model @xcite .",
    "the assumption of this model is that a collision occurs with 100% probability if the two collision partners come closer to each other than a critical distance .",
    "only the longest - range attractive interaction , the ion - induced dipole potential ( first term in eq .",
    "[ long - range - pot : eq ] ) , and the repulsive centrifugal potential are taken into account .",
    "this critical distance is then given by the location of the maximum of the centrifugal barrier .",
    "the largest impact parameter for a scattering trajectory that reaches this critical distance and can surmount the centrifugal barrier determines the scattering cross section . for larger impact parameters",
    "the ion - neutral interaction is neglected . with an additional thermal averaging ,",
    "this assumption yields the langevin rate coefficient ( in si units ) @xmath17 which turns out to be temperature independent .",
    "@xmath4 is again the orientation - averaged polarisability of the neutral molecule while @xmath18 denotes the reduced mass of the two - body system ( @xmath6 is the ion charge and @xmath19 the electric constant ) .",
    "typical langevin rate coefficients range between @xmath20@xmath21/s and @xmath22@xmath21/s .",
    "a correction to the langevin rate coefficient has to be introduced if the neutral target carries a permanent dipole moment @xmath5 .",
    "then the second term in eq .",
    "( [ long - range - pot : eq ] ) needs to be included .",
    "the `` average dipole orientation '' approach @xcite introduced an effective `` dipole locking constant '' from which an improved collision rate coefficient was derived . in a more accurate approach",
    ", the rate coefficient for ion - polar molecule collisions is calculated from a series of classical trajectories that are calculated to numerical precision for the exact interaction potential .",
    "the parameterisation of these trajectories leads to a pre - factor @xmath23 to the langevin rate constant eq .",
    "[ langevin : eq ] , which is a function of @xmath5 and @xmath4 @xcite . as an effect",
    "the ion - polar molecule capture rate coefficient is typically a factor of two to four larger than the prediction for the langevin rate coefficient .",
    "the langevin rate constant has proven to be extremely valuable as a guideline and often describes fairly accurately measured reaction rates for cations with nonpolar neutral molecules @xcite . when the observed rate coefficient for an ion - molecule reaction is smaller than the capture rate coefficient , which occurs when the reaction probability after crossing the centrifugal barrier is smaller than 100% , temperature- or energy - dependent rate coefficient measurements can be used to infer information on the reaction dynamics at short internuclear separation .    in the next sections",
    "this approach will be illustrated with several studies from recent years .",
    "most major experimental techniques that are used for these studies , drift and flow tubes , guided ion beams , free jet expansions and low - temperature ion traps will be discussed .",
    "ion cyclotron resonance experiments and high - pressure mass spectrometry ( see e.g.@xcite ) , however , will not be covered in this article .",
    "flow and drift tubes have been the classic workhorse for the acquisition of ion - molecule reaction rate coefficients .",
    "they have produced a wealth of atmospherically and astrophysically relevant data over the almost 50 years of their existence @xcite .",
    "today they are found in many different variants e.g.@xcite .",
    "these instruments usually operate at room temperature , but may also be heated up to more than 1000k or cooled down to near liquid nitrogen temperatures ( 77k ) .",
    "ions are created typically by electron impact , eventually chemically transformed and mass selected , and then injected into a constant flow of buffer gas of several m / s velocity .",
    "the pressure of this buffer gas , which is usually helium , is of the order of a few millibar .",
    "consequently , the mean free path of the ions is smaller than the dimension of the tube and the flowing buffer gas transports the thermalised ions downstream through the flow tube .",
    "a distance away from the ion source , neutral reactant gas is injected .",
    "due to reactions of the ions with the neutral gas their density decreases with flow time , which now corresponds to the flow distance .",
    "at the same time , product ions are generated . by sampling ion yield and composition with a quadrupole mass spectrometer as a function of flow distance",
    "absolute reaction rate coefficients can be extracted .",
    "their temperature dependence may be obtained by heating or cooling the buffer gas inlet and flow section .",
    "an electric field gradient may be applied along the flow section turning the flow tube into a drift tube .",
    "this allows studies at elevated kinetic energy rather than temperature .",
    "the rate coefficient gives a first hint at the dynamics of an ion - molecule reaction .",
    "barrier - less proton transfer reactions usually exhibit large rate coefficients in accordance with the capture model @xcite .",
    "in contrast many anion - molecule reactions feature orders of magnitude lower rate coefficients , pointing at dynamical bottlenecks and intermediate barriers on the potential energy hypersurface .",
    "chemically versatile flow and drift tubes are well suited to study the effects of chemical substitution on the rate coefficient @xcite .",
    "different reaction mechanisms leading to the same ( ionic ) products may be distinguished by studying kinetic isotope effects @xcite .",
    "more direct insight into the dynamics can be obtained from a temperature dependent flow tube measurement of the rate coefficient @xcite . moreover , in drift tubes internal and translational degrees of freedom of the reaction partners are decoupled and can be separately controlled .",
    "this allows to investigate how the reaction rate changes if the same amount of energy is provided in different forms , challenging a statistical model of the reaction dynamics @xcite .",
    "probably the most important type of anion - molecule reaction that has been studied up to now is the nucleophilic substitution ( s@xmath242 ) reaction @xcite : @xmath25 where x and y can anything from simple halogen atoms to large macro - molecular systems .",
    "the assumption of statistical energy redistribution was a matter of fierce debate in the 1990s in the framework of s@xmath242 reactions .",
    "a variable temperature flow tube study had shown that the cl@xmath0 + ch@xmath26br reaction rate is strongly dependent on the relative translational energy , while being at the same time insensitive to the internal temperature of the reactants @xcite .",
    "such behaviour is in clear contradiction with the statistical assumption of rapid randomisation of all available energy in the [ cl @xmath27 ch@xmath26br]@xmath0 entrance channel complex .",
    "this observation prompted a large number of theoretical studies , which uncovered a dynamical bottleneck for energy transfer between internal modes of ch@xmath26br and the intermolecular low - frequency modes @xcite .",
    "in a recent application of an ion flow tube instrument , the competition between nucleophilic substitution ( s@xmath242 ) and base - induced elimination ( e2 ) was investigated via chemical substitution and the deuterium kinetic isotope effect @xcite .",
    "villano et al .",
    "studied the reaction of bro@xmath0 and clo@xmath0 with methyl chloride ( ch@xmath26cl ) and its partially and fully methylated form cxyzcl ( where x , y , z can be either h or ch@xmath26 ) .",
    "s@xmath242 and e2 mechanisms lead to the same ionic reaction product , a challenge for all experiments , which rely on charged particle detection .",
    "the authors used that deuteration of the neutral reactant changes the rate of the reaction .",
    "the deuterium kinetic isotope effect is defined as the ratio of perprotio to perdeuterio rate coefficient ( kie=@xmath28 ) .",
    "whereas for ch@xmath26cl an inverse kie was determined ( i.e. kie@xmath291 ) , the kie was found to become increasingly more normal ( kie@xmath301 ) as the extend of methyl - substitution in the neutral reactant is increased . for the reaction of bro@xmath0 with the fully methylated neutral species , an about a factor of three larger reaction rate coefficient was measured for ( ch@xmath26)@xmath26ccl as compared to its deuterated form ( cd@xmath26)@xmath26ccl .",
    "villano et al",
    ". referred to a marked effect of deuteration on the vibrational dynamics near the respective transition states of the s@xmath242 and the e2 mechanism @xcite .",
    "they argued that the e2 pathway is a minor channel for the small neutral reactant ch@xmath26cl , whereas it becomes gradually more important with increasing methylation of the neutral , which sterically hinders and finally impedes nucleophilic substitution .",
    "the oxidation of the trichlorooxyphosphorus anion pocl@xmath2 , which occurs in combustion flames , has been recently studied by kerkines _",
    "despite its very low rate coefficient of only around 1x10@xmath31 @xmath21/s ( at 300k ) , such oxidations can change the chemistry of flames due to the high abundance of o@xmath32 .",
    "the authors employed a turbulent ion flow tube , where orders of magnitude higher neutral gas densities can be applied as compared to the conventional laminar flow tubes @xcite .",
    "they measured the rate coefficient over the range of 300 - 626k and found it to increase slowly with increasing temperature .",
    "an arrhenius fit yielded an activation energy of 50mev . since the oxidation is exothermic by about 1.8ev , the presence of an intermediate potential barrier was concluded .",
    "examination of the reaction pathways at different levels of molecular orbital theory led to the proposal of a multistep reaction mechanism .",
    "it involves product formation via the transformation of the entrance channel ion - dipole complex into a four - membered p @xmath27 o - o @xmath27 cl ring transition state , the highest point on the potential energy surface .",
    "the highest temperature studies of ion - molecule reactions under fully thermalised conditions have been undertaken in a high temperature flowing afterglow apparatus at up to 1800k @xcite .",
    "for an anion - molecule reaction , 1440k has been reached for co@xmath2 + so@xmath32 @xmath33 so@xmath2 + co@xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the main driving force for these technically challenging experiments is to model the chemical environment of the earth s ionosphere and other planetary atmospheres at high altitude .",
    "however , these studies are also interesting from the reaction dynamics point of view . at these high temperatures",
    "even small molecules carry significant amounts of rotational and vibrational excitation .",
    "it can be explored how energy supplied in different forms - translational or internal - affects the reaction rate . for the reaction of co@xmath2 with so@xmath32 , miller et al . found by comparison with drift tube data that the total energy alone controls the reactivity @xcite .",
    "they concluded that the independence of the rate coefficient on the form of energy implies that the reaction is governed by long lived intermediates in which energy equilibrates , even at the very high temperatures .",
    "guided ion beam ( gib ) studies are the method of choice for precise measurements of integral reaction cross sections of ion - molecule reactions for collision energies of the millielectronvolt to the tens of electronvolt range .",
    "these measurements also allow for the determination of the opening and competition of different reactive channels in ion - molecule collisions @xcite .",
    "teloy and gerlich introduced gibs into gas - phase chemistry in pioneering experiments in freiburg in the 1970s @xcite . in this technique",
    "mass selected ions are passed into a long radio frequency ( rf ) multipole ion guide - typically an octupole - with a selected kinetic energy , controlled by the dc potential difference between the ion source and the ion guide .",
    "importantly , the guiding multipole electric rf field contains the ions radially , while at the same time minimising alteration of their kinetic energy .",
    "the latter is crucial to the technique and impedes the use of quadrupole rf fields : micro motion of the ions driven by the oscillating field results in energetic collisions with buffer and reaction gas .",
    "these effects are referred to as radio frequency heating and are minimised in a multipole rf field @xcite .",
    "the created effective potential guides the ions through a scattering cell located at the centre of the long guide .",
    "the neutral reaction partner is introduced into the scattering cell - which may be temperature - variable @xcite - at a well characterised density .",
    "ions collide with the neutrals as they pass through the scattering cell and undergo chemical reactions .",
    "note that the multipole guide also contains the ionic reaction products .",
    "all ions are mass analysed when they reach the end of the guide , typically with a quadrupole mass selector .",
    "counting the number of reactant and product ions allows one to determine absolute integral cross sections for ion - molecule reactions and collision induced dissociation .",
    "these measurements can be done as a function of the relative kinetic energy of the reactants over an extended range of energies from about 0.1 to hundreds of ev .",
    "gib measurements achieve high resolution since they ensure single collision conditions in contrast to drift tubes and employ better defined , narrow ion velocity distributions @xcite . at the same time",
    "the range of relative collision energies is extended since ions are radially contained and can not get lost by drifting to the walls of the tube . to further minimise the energy spread of the reactants , sophisticated ion sources such as flow tubes and multipole traps",
    "are used @xcite .",
    "the bulk of gib studies have focused on positively charged ions .",
    "negative ion chemistry has been investigated in particular by the group of kent ervin , with special emphasis on nucleophilic substitution .",
    "to uncover reaction dynamics and mechanisms , the group heavily employs ab initio calculations and density functional theory in the interpretation of their measurements .",
    "the high resolution of gib measurements allows to reveal the threshold behaviour of endoergic reactions @xcite and of exothermic reactions , which feature an intermediate potential barrier @xcite .",
    "the wide tunability of the relative collision energy enables studies of the opening and interplay of reaction mechanisms leading to different ionic products .",
    "absolute integral cross sections of competing nucleophilic substitution and abstraction reactions were obtained @xcite .",
    "collision induced dissociation of anion - dipole complexes accesses the dynamics at the transition state @xcite . in an advanced mode of operation",
    ", gib experiments may be run in a pulsed manner and the dwell time of the ionic reaction products in the long guide may be used to analyse their axial kinetic energy distribution .",
    "this allows to some degree to distinguish between forward and backward scattering for a more direct insight into ion - molecule reaction dynamics @xcite .",
    "haufler , schlemmer and gerlich carried out a pioneering gib study for anions , investigating the fundamental molecular reaction h@xmath0 + d@xmath32 @xmath33 d@xmath0 + hd and its isotopic variant d@xmath0 + h@xmath32 @xmath33 h@xmath0 + hd @xcite .",
    "integral cross sections have been obtained as a function of collision energy between 0.1 and 10ev translational energy in the centre - of - mass frame .",
    "they show an onset at around 0.3ev , a maximum at around 1ev and a decrease at larger collision energies .",
    "barriers of 350 and 330mev were deduced for h@xmath0 + d@xmath32 and d@xmath0 + h@xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the decrease of the cross section was attributed to the competition with collisional electron detachment of the reactant anion .",
    "interestingly , it was found that the integral cross section of the heavy ion colliding with the light molecule is larger by a factor of two , reaching 2.7@xmath34 at its maximum .",
    "axial product time - of - flight distributions have been measured by recording arrival times and converted to differential cross sections d@xmath35/d@xmath36",
    "( @xmath36 denotes the velocity component of the products along the guide ) .",
    "preferred forward scattering was found for low collision energies just above threshold . by variation of the depth of the effective potential via the rf amplitude , which probes the transversal velocity distribution , the authors concluded that internal excitation of the product molecule is not significant at these energies .",
    "thus they were able to deconvolute d@xmath35/d@xmath36 to obtain angle - differential cross sections d@xmath35/d@xmath37 .",
    "these could be cross - calibrated against crossed - beam data @xcite ( see section [ conv - crossed - beams : sect ] ) .",
    "the angle differential cross sections were found to be quite similar for the two variants of the reaction , despite the big isotope effect observed in the integral cross section .",
    "the authors concluded that the region of the potential energy surface probed in the exit channel has to be similar and the increased reactivity of d@xmath0 + h@xmath32 has to stem from dynamics in the entrance channel .",
    "deturi _ et al .",
    "_ investigated the symmetric s@xmath242 reaction cl@xmath0 + ch@xmath26cl @xmath33 clch@xmath26 + cl@xmath0 @xcite by isotopic labelling .",
    "for this system , a translational energy threshold of 2ev had been determined 10 years before in a pioneering and well - recognised drift tube measurement by the bierbaum group @xcite .",
    "based on that finding , anionic attack on the chlorine side of chloromethane ( `` frontside attack '' ) had been proposed as the reaction mechanism ( potential barrier 2.0ev ) , and subsequently been backed by theoretical studies @xcite . in contrast , deturi _ et al .",
    "_ determined a translational energy threshold of 470@xmath38160mev in their gib experiment .",
    "the authors argued that the previous measurement had been affected by the skewed reactant kinetic energy distribution in the drift tube as well as by collisions with its high density helium buffer gas during the lifetime of the entrance channel complex .",
    "the adjusted threshold , however , energetically excludes frontside attack as the reaction mechanism . on the other hand the conventional s@xmath242 back - side attack mechanism , with inversion of the carbon centre , features a potential barrier height of only around 120mev , substantially lower than the measured threshold by deturi et al .",
    "this puzzle prompted a lot of studies on the theoretical side .",
    "quasiclassical trajectory simulations by the hase group both on an analytical potential energy surface @xcite and with the ab initio direct dynamics method @xcite as well as reduced - dimensionality quantum dynamical calculations @xcite were undertaken .",
    "it was confirmed that frontside attack is not the reaction mechanism and backside attack prevails .",
    "however , in contrast to the conventional s@xmath242 mechanism , it was found that only a very small fraction of the reactive trajectories are indirect , with transient trapping in the ion - dipole wells .",
    "this is assigned to poor coupling of the provided translational excitation to internal degrees of molecular freedom .",
    "a direct pathway of product formation , on the other hand , seems to feature strict dynamical constraints for low collision energy such as a very restricted geometry of approach for passing over the minimum energy barrier .",
    "the power of the gib technique is nicely demonstrated in complementary cross section studies of the exothermic s@xmath242 reaction f@xmath0 + ch@xmath26cl and its counterpart , the endothermic reverse reaction",

    "an early transition state in the exothermic direction for the collinear reaction pathway renders translational energy efficient in promoting the reaction .",
    "this accounts for the high cross section in excess of 100@xmath34 for low collision energies .",
    "after translational passage over the barrier trajectories need to pass the `` bend '' along the reaction coordinate to form products . hence much of the reactant translation is expected to be converted into excitation of the c - cl stretch vibration of the product molecule .",
    "microscopic reversibility suggests in turn that vibrational excitation of ch@xmath26cl is needed in the endothermic direction to efficiently pass the initial tight bend on the pes before surmounting the late transition state .",
    "translational activation such as in the gib experiment should hence be inefficient at promoting the endothermic reaction .",

    "some of these reactions exhibit dual rising features .",
    "reaction mechanisms have been proposed based on molecular structure calculations .",
    "while gib techniques are strong at determining integral reaction cross sections , the very detailed and insightful study by angel and ervin also clearly shows their limitations .",
    "an experimental method is needed , which can provide more direct insight into the reaction dynamics and is capable of dissecting the partitioning of energy into translational and internal degrees of molecular freedom ( see section [ crossed - beams : sect ] ) .",
    "as first demonstrated by gerlich @xcite and already mentioned above , gib methods can in fact provide to some degree more direct insight into the reaction dynamics by recording the arrival time of the product ions .",
    "angel and ervin applied this technique in a study of the exothermic s@xmath242 reaction cl@xmath0 + ch@xmath26br @xcite .",
    "they reported the relative product velocity distribution along the axis of the ion guide for a series of relative collision energies between 0.1 and 4.0ev . at 0.1ev ,",
    "the s@xmath422 product velocity was found to be symmetrically distributed around the centre of mass velocity and to agree well with the prediction of a statistical phase space theory ( pst ) model .",
    "this can be regarded as strong sign that the reaction is complex - mediated . at 0.25ev ,",
    "the velocity distribution becomes asymmetric with a preference for forward scattering of the ch@xmath26cl product .",
    "this shows that the reaction becomes more direct , with reactant interaction on a time scale less than the rotational period of the complex . at 0.5ev ,",
    "backward scattering arises and becomes dominant above 1.0ev .",
    "the authors interpreted this as introduction of a direct rebound mechanism .      at lower and lower temperatures",
    "the dynamics of ion - molecule reactions become more sensitive to details of the interaction potential and to quantum dynamical effects such as tunnelling .",
    "changes in the rate coefficients at low temperature also affect the abundance of ions in atmospheric and interstellar plasmas , which are often characterised by temperatures well - below room temperature .",
    "this has raised substantial interest in low - temperature studies of ion - molecule reactions .",
    "very low temperatures , down to about 0.1k , are reached in free jet supersonic flows employing adiabatic expansion @xcite .",
    "however , the complex cooling process that is induced by the transient flow dynamics of an expanding free jet does lead to temperature disequilibria for the different molecular degrees of freedom and non - thermal rotational state distributions @xcite . despite these difficulties supersonic jets",

    "two examples are the study of vibrational quenching of no@xmath43(@xmath44=1 ) via helium by complex formation below 3kelvin @xcite and the reopening of the bimolecular c@xmath32h@xmath45 channel in the hydrogen transfer of h@xmath32 to c@xmath32h@xmath46 for low temperatures , which is attributed to tunnelling of a collision complex through the reaction barrier @xcite .",

    "uniform expansions from precisely designed laval nozzles can overcome some of the difficulties of free jet flows by maintaining parallel stream lines at constant mach number @xcite .",
    "constant high densities are reached at a fixed temperature in the travelling frame over the entire flow , which makes equilibration of the molecules degrees of freedom more likely . by terminating the supersonic expansion through parallelisation of the stream lines in the nozzle ,",

    ", it became clear that for the efficient cooling and complete thermalisation of molecular ions with a buffer gas , trapping in a quasi field - free environment is indispensable @xcite .",
    "gerlich pioneered the development of cryogenic storage devices based on electric multipole fields , which are capable of cooling molecular ions to a few kelvin in all degrees of molecular freedom .",

    "thus , in 98% of the collision events the reactants are reproduced and no products are being formed .",
    "this occurs despite the fact that the reaction is exothermic and also the intermediate potential barrier lies below the energy of the entrance channel .",
    "it shows that for this reaction the reaction dynamics at short range are very important .     with h@xmath32 ( eq .  [ nh2:reaction ] ) as a function of temperature @xcite .",
    "the data show that the probability for reaction increases with decreasing temperature but stays well below the langevin limit .",
    "below 20k the data show an unexpected decrease of the reaction probability that can not be explained by a classical statistical model ( dashed line ) . ]    at lower temperatures the probability for reaction ( [ nh2:reaction ] ) increases strongly @xcite .",
    "the data are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ reactions : fig ] . at 20k",
    "the probability has increased by a factor of six .",
    "this increase is a manifestation of the complex - mediated reaction dynamics @xcite : the intermediate nh@xmath48 complex , which is transiently formed during a collision that surmounts the centrifugal barrier , has a longer lifetime with respect to decay back to reactants at lower temperatures , because the number of available decay channels decreases .",
    "the probability to cross the intermediate potential barrier and form products , however , remains approximately constant .",
    "therefore the overall probability to react increases .",
    "the observed decrease of the reaction probability for temperatures lower than 20k ( see fig .  [",

    "stabilisation of the complex can occur in a second step if a third particle impact removes more internal excitation from the complex than the initial relative translational and internal energy of its constituents .",
    "this is only a small fraction of its internal excitation given the binding energy of ground state [ cl@xmath49ch@xmath26cl ] of about 450mev with respect to the asymptote . in subsequent collisions the internal energy is thermalised with the environment .",
    "re - excitation of the complex above the asymptote for dissociation is then strongly suppressed by a boltzmann factor .",
    "conditions are arranged such that the stabilisation step occurs with a high probability by the buffer gas , which is provided in large excess as compared to the reaction partners . at the same time",
    "the low - pressure limit of the steady state approximation has to be valid , which practically means that it has to be ensured that stabilisation of the complex is a rare event .",

    "this approach of crossed - beam measurements of the differential scattering cross section is widely used for neutral reactions @xcite .",
    "we will discuss in the following two sections that it also proves to be valuable for anion - neutral reactions .",
    "the classical approach to crossed - beam reactive scattering is to cross two reactant beams at 90@xmath68 and use a rotatable detector to measure the flux and the arrival time of products under a selected set of scattering angles in the laboratory frame of reference . from these laboratory flux data the differential cross section in the centre - of - mass frame of the reaction",
    "is reconstructed , often using numerical simulations of the apparatus function .",
    "this approach has been developed for neutral - neutral reactions and has been used with great success to study the f + h@xmath32 reaction ( see e.g.@xcite ) . in combination with the rydberg tagging technique to measure the h atom product ,",
    "the rotatable - detector setup is still the method of choice for this reaction @xcite .",
    "the same detector concept has been applied to study elastic , inelastic and reactive channels in cation - molecule reactions ( see refs.@xcite for reviews of the early work on cation - molecule reactive scattering ) . here",
    "the main difference to neutral - neutral scattering experiments is , naturally , the production of the ion beam . where the neutral beams are usually produced in supersonic expansions with a well defined narrow range of velocities , the production of ion beams with a narrow velocity spread represents a major experimental challenge . for the study of chemical reactions the most interesting relative collision energies in the centre - of - mass frame range from millielectronvolts to a few electronvolts .",
    "therefore ion beams have to be produced with a low kinetic energy and a correspondingly small energy spread .",
    "this has been achieved for the first time in the 1970s for continuous beams of cations @xcite .",
    "a high degree of control over the electric fields in the experimental setup , including contact potentials between different materials , are important to achieve a low energy spread .",
    "even then , the coulomb repulsion between the reactant ions in the beam ultimately limits the energy resolution for a given reactant density and thus scattering rate . for ion - molecule reactions",
    "this typically leads to a reduction in the ion reactant density by many orders of magnitude in comparison with a neutral supersonic beam .",
    "this is only to a small extend compensated by the higher detection efficiency for product ions in a charged - particle detector when compared to neutral products of neutral - neutral reactions which have to be ionised in the detector .",
    "note that once the control over the ion - beam energy is achieved in an experimental setup , the relative collision energy of the crossed beams can be continuously tuned by means of the ion acceleration potential .",
    "such a tunable scattering energy is much more difficult to achieve for neutral - neutral reactions .",
    "there , different seed gases for the molecules in the supersonic beams and different intersection angles between the supersonic beams are required for the same purpose .",
    "it was only in the 1990s that precise low - energy crossed - beam measurements with negative ions in a rotatable detector setup have been carried out @xcite . in the years before the first detailed scattering experiments on anion - molecule reactions have been carried out using a complex multiparticle coincidence scattering setup . with this setup reactions of heavy , mostly",
    "atomic , negative ions ( f@xmath0 , cl@xmath0 , br@xmath0 , i@xmath0 , s@xmath0 , cn@xmath0 ) with light - weight hydrogen could be studied @xcite .",
    "for example for the cl@xmath0 + h@xmath32 collision , the kinematics of this combination have made it possible to study collisions down to 6ev relative energy with an ion kinetic energies of 110ev @xcite , which is significantly easier to handle experimentally than ion beams with only few electronvolt kinetic energy .",
    "furthermore , under these conditions the kinetic energy of the neutral product in the lab frame is large enough to be detected with a microchannel plate detector . with this technique the different channels for the collision of cl@xmath0 with h@xmath32 , reactive proton transfer , forming hcl + h@xmath0 , reactive detachment , forming hcl + h + e@xmath0 , simple detachment , leading to cl + h@xmath32 + e@xmath0 , and dissociative detachment , leading to cl + h + h + e@xmath0 , could be distinguished and their differential and absolute cross sections could be measured as a function of the relative energy @xcite .",
    "also some information on the vibrational state population of the product molecule could be inferred . from these data",

    "more recently , non - reactive and reactive collisions of oh@xmath0 anions with d@xmath32 molecules have been studied by the same group @xcite . in the isotopic exchange reaction channel ,",
    "the formation of od@xmath0 + hd , no energy dependence was found between 0.27 and 0.69ev relative collision energy @xcite . in the measured narrow angular distribution",
    "it was found that the reaction occurs fast on the time scale of rotation of the oh@xmath0(h@xmath32 ) reaction complex . in a study of the proton transfer reaction channel , forming hod + d@xmath0 ,",
    "also a very narrow velocity distribution was extracted @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed velocity distribution in the scattering plane is reproduced in fig .",
    "[ farrar - data : fig ] .",
    "these data also indicate a direct and fast reaction mechanism .",
    "the flux at smaller product ion velocities is caused by vibrational excitation of the bending mode in the hod product .",
    "this can be attributed to a significant change of the water bond angle during the d@xmath43 transfer .",
    "compared to the conventional crossed - beam experiments with a rotatable detector , higher angular resolution and a much more rapid data acquisition is achieved with an imaging spectrometer .",
    "moreover , such a spectrometer detects products irrespective of their velocity or scattering angle , i.e.  it represents a detector with @xmath69 solid angle of acceptance .",
    "ion imaging has been combined with neutral reactive scattering starting with a study of the h + d@xmath32 reaction @xcite and is being successfully employed in a number of laboratories for reactive and inelastic crossed - beam scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "the current spectrometers are based on the technique of velocity map imaging @xcite , which projects ions with the same velocity parallel to the detector surface onto the same spot on the detector .",
    "it thereby avoids broadening of the product ion images due to the finite size of the reaction volume .    to study ion - molecule reactions with crossed beam imaging",
    ", we have constructed a velocity map imaging spectrometer and a versatile low - energy ion source @xcite .",
    "this approach is in contrast with an early exploration of ion - molecule crossed beam imaging , where an in - situ production of the reactant ions was used @xcite , an approach that is not usable for negative ions . in our experiment , slow ions with between 0.5 and 5ev kinetic energy are brought to collision with neutral molecules in a supersonic molecular beam in the centre of the velocity map imaging electrode stack .",
    "both reactant beams are pulsed to avoid a heavy gas load in the vacuum system .",
    "once the two beams have crossed , the electric field of the imaging spectrometer is rapidly pulsed on and any product ions are projected onto the position sensitive imaging detector .",
    "ion impact positions , which are proportional to the velocity components in the scattering plane parallel to the detector surface , are recorded with a ccd camera .",
    "recently , we improved the ion imaging electrodes to enhance the velocity resolution and we included a photomultiplier tube to measure the third , vertical , component of the product velocity vector @xcite .    with the ion - molecule crossed beam imaging spectrometer we have studied the elementary s@xmath242-reaction of cl@xmath0 with methyl iodide ( ch@xmath26i ) at relative scattering energies between 0.4 and 2ev @xcite . the potential energy curve for this reaction along the reaction coordinate",
    "is closely resembled in fig .",
    "[ reaction - pot : fig ] .",
    "as discussed already in section [ interaction : sect ] the characteristic deep potential minima , separated by an intermediate barrier , are found . in the reaction studied here",
    "this barrier lies submerged below the energy of the reactants .",
    "nevertheless it strongly influences the reactivity in that the reaction occurs at only 10% of the langevin or capture rate .",
    "the imaging data , which is represented by an event list of impact velocity vectors in the laboratory frame , needs only little data processing . on the one hand",
    ", the transformation to the centre of mass frame has to be performed for each scattering event , which involves a translation and a rotation of the image parallel to the relative velocity vector . on the other hand",
    ", the loss of fast moving reaction products needs to be corrected .",
    "product ions with high laboratory velocities have a chance to leave the spectrometer volume that can be imaged onto the position - sensitive detector .",
    "this effect is referred to as density - to - flux correction in neutral crossed beam scattering experiments , where it also includes the correction for the spatial and velocity dependence of the ionisation efficiency . for ion - molecule",
    "reactive imaging , the same correction function is used for all relative collision energies .",
    "it only depends on the magnitude of the laboratory velocity and not on its direction in the lab frame .",
    "measured differential scattering cross section for the reaction of cl@xmath0 + ch@xmath26i giving clch@xmath26 + i@xmath0 . shown",
    "are two images at 0.39 ( left panel ) and 1.9ev ( right panel ) relative collision energy of the i@xmath0 velocity vector in the scattering plane obtained by velocity map slice imaging .",
    "the centre of each image denotes zero velocity in the centre of mass frame .",
    "the circles represent constant product velocities with the largest circle showing the maximum possible product velocity based on the known total energy in the reaction system . at 0.39ev isotropic scattering",
    "is observed , indicative of an indirect reaction mechanism via a long - lived complex . at 1.9ev",
    "most of the flux shows direct scattering with large product velocities ( peak near @xmath70 m/s , but with about 10% probability , small product velocities both forward and backward scattered , are observed .",
    "these events are attributed to the indirect `` roundabout '' mechanism ( taken from @xcite ) . ]",
    "two measured images of the differential cross section in the centre - of - mass frame are shown in fig .",
    "[ sn2-images : fig ] for two relative energies @xcite . at 0.39ev isotropic scattering of the i@xmath0 product ion",
    "is observed , indicative of an indirect reaction mechanism via a long - lived complex . here , also much more energy is partitioned into internal excitation of the neutral ch@xmath26cl product .",
    "this indicates an indirect reaction mechanism with trapping of the collision partners in the minima of the intermolecular reaction potential .",
    "in contrast , at 1.9ev the i@xmath0 ions scatter preferentially backward with respect to the direction of the incoming ch@xmath26i .",
    "also their velocity is found very near the maximum possible velocity .",
    "this is explained by a fast and direct reaction mechanism where the i@xmath0 leaves the reaction approximately co - linearly with the incoming cl@xmath0 anion .    in order to understand the details of the measured differential cross sections theoretical calculation",
    "are employed .",
    "however , the theoretical description of polyatomic reactions that involve more than four atoms is very difficult .",
    "the present reaction involves six atoms and therefore twelve internal degrees of freedom .",
    "such a large system can not be calculated quantum mechanically and one has to resort to significant approximations .",
    "these are either quantum scattering calculations in reduced dimensions ( typically four ) @xcite or calculations that treat the electronic structure quantum mechanically but propagate the nuclei classically on the born - oppenheimer surface @xcite .",
    "calculated trajectories show that at 1.9ev collision energy a direct reaction mechanism governs the nucleophilic substitution reaction .",
    "the cl@xmath0 ions moves into the umbrella of the hydrogen atoms and forms a bond with the central carbon atom .",
    "roughly co - linearly to this motion the i@xmath0 product ion is moving away after the three hydrogen atoms have inverted to form the clch@xmath26 product molecule .",
    "this numerical results corresponds directly to the back - scattering observed in the experiment .",
    "the trajectory calculations also revealed another reaction mechanism that occurs with about 10% probability . in this mechanism",
    "the ch@xmath26i reactant undergoes a single 360@xmath68 revolution about an axis perpendicular to the c - i bond . only after this revolution the substitution occurs .",
    "this mechanism , which we named the `` roundabout '' mechanism , is found to go along with a large energy partitioning into internal degrees of freedom of the neutral product molecule .",
    "this agrees with the observed structures in the measured differential cross sections at small i@xmath0 velocity ( see fig .  [",
    "sn2-images : fig ] ) , which have therefore been attributed to the roundabout mechanism @xcite .",
    "negative ion reactions have been studied for a long time owing to their importance in many earth - bound , planetary or astrophysical plasmas . in the last two decades research on the detailed dynamics of this class of reactions",
    "has flourished , owing to more and more precise techniques to measure both integral and differential scattering studies . in this article",
    "we have presented an overview of these experimental approaches and how much they have been teaching us on the different , and sometimes peculiar , aspects of anion - molecule reaction dynamics .",
    "we have shown that flow and drift tube measurements are well suited to study the thermal kinetics of anion - molecule reactions .",
    "at low temperature these studies are complemented and extended using cryogenic ion traps , which also can measure much smaller rate coefficients than drift tubes due to the long attainable interaction times . guided ion beam experiments are ideal for precise measurements of integral cross sections at well - defined relative energy over a large dynamic range .",
    "the dynamics of the transient reaction complex can be studied with direct time - resolved spectroscopy and its lifetime can also be indirectly inferred from ternary collision rates .",
    "when it comes to direct imaging the full reaction dynamics , crossed - beam experiments are very revealing . in particular the new opportunities of crossed - beam velocity map ion imaging should be stressed here .    despite a wealth of theoretical studies , detailed insight into the flow of energy via the coupling of different vibrational modes during",
    "the reaction continues to be not accessed experimentally .",
    "of particular interest is the regime of breakdown of ergodicity at the transition from a complex mediated , statistical to an impulsive reaction mechanism .",
    "it is in this range of relative collision energies , where crossed beam imaging provides the best resolution .",
    "reactive scattering with vibrationally excited reactants - as successfully used to shed light on chemical reactions of neutrals @xcite - is not yet explored for anion - molecule reactions .",
    "the role of non - reactive degrees of freedom in a reaction , referred to as the `` spectator modes '' , on the integral cross section and the product branching is a matter of debate that needs answers from experiments .",
    "reactive scattering with spatially aligned or oriented molecules would directly access the stereodynamics on the molecular level .",
    "importantly , anion - molecule reactions have very different kinetics in solution .",
    "a bottom - up approach , introducing the solvent molecule per molecule in scattering experiments with microsolvated anions , would highlight the role of the environment on the dynamics .",
    "questions about the role of quantum effects such as feshbach scattering resonances , tunnelling , zero - point vibrational motion or decoherence free subspaces can be dared to be asked now and demand innovative experimental approaches .",
    "we expect that guided ion beam and ion trap studies as well as ion - molecule crossed - beam imaging will be most helpful to address some of these questions in the future .",
    "the combination of an ion trap as a source for internally cold molecular ions and clusters with a scattering experiment will allow for studies of the reactions of complex molecular systems while maintaining good control over their internal quantum states . also merged ion and neutral beams represent a useful approach to study low - energy reactions , as demonstrated most recently for the reaction of h@xmath0 with h @xcite , which is considered to be important for the formation of h@xmath32 in the early universe .",
    "laser - cooling of the reactants may eventually provide even lower collision temperatures than buffer gas cooling , an approach that has been demonstrated for cation - neutral reactions @xcite ; os@xmath0 is a possible candidate for anion laser cooling @xcite .",
    "all in all , there is also a lot of room for further research on anion - molecule reactions , that challenges the `` complexity limit '' and ultimately allows us to understand and control all the subtleties of the chemical dynamics of multi - atom molecular systems .",
    "we would like to thank our collaborators in the experiments on anion - molecule reaction dynamics , in particular sebastian trippel , rico otto , and christoph eichhorn .",
    "we also wish to thank dan neumark and bill hase for the fruitful collaborations on reaction dynamics in general and nucleophilic substitution reactions in particular .",
