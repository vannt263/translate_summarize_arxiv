    "one of the most important problems in quantum information theory is the problem of quantifying correlations .",
    "henderson and vedral raised the problem of separating total correlations in a bipartite state into quantum and classical parts @xcite ( see also in this context @xcite).they also proposed a measure of purely classical bipartite correlations .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there exist bipartite states which have almost maximal entanglement of formation and almost no mutual information and hence , almost no classical correlations . in a series of papers a thermodynamical approach to quantifying correlations",
    "was developed @xcite .",
    "it is well known that bits of information can be used to extract work from a heat bath @xcite .",
    "if we have a bipartite quantum state one can ask how much work can be extracted from the heat bath under different classes of operations . in particular quantum information deficit",
    "was defined .",
    "it is the difference between globally and locally ( with the use of local operations and classical communication ) extractable work from the heat bath .",
    "recently it was shown that under some restricted scenario of work extraction there exist quantum states for which quantum information deficit is equal to quantum mutual information @xcite . as a result ,",
    "all correlations behave , as if they were exclusively quantum .",
    "the problem of coexistence of quantum and classical correlations in multipartite systems was considered in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that there exist @xmath0-qubit states which consist of an equal mixture of two w states with an odd number of qubits , for which @xmath0-party covariance defined as @xmath1 is zero for all choices of local observables @xmath2 and the state is genuinely entangled . based on these observations the authors argued that genuine multipartite correlations can exist without classical correlations .",
    "however , the conclusion is based on assumption that covariance is an indicator of genuine multipartite correlations .    in this paper",
    "we formulate three postulates which any measure or indicator of genuine multipartite correlations should satisfy .",
    "we show that covariance does not satisfy two postulates when applied to more than two - partite systems .",
    "our counterexamples will be the states considered in @xcite .",
    "hence , vanishing of covariance for multipartite states does not imply absence of genuine multipartite classical correlations but rather shows that covariance can not be an indicator of genuine multipartite classical correlations . as a by - product we obtain a protocol of distillation of w states from a wide class of states ( for distillation of w states from generic states see @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we formulate reasonable postulates for measures or indicators of genuine multipartite correlations and introduce degree of correlations . in section iii we show that covariance does not satisfy postulates . in section",
    "iv we discuss relation between multipartite correlations and work extraction . in section",
    "v we draw our conclusions .",
    "we do not know what it means that a state has genuine multipartite correlations .",
    "hence we give reasonable postulates which each measure or indicator of genuine multipartite correlations should satisfy . in subsection",
    "a we formulate postulates for genuine @xmath0-partite correlations of an @xmath0-partite state while in subsection b we formulate postulates for genuine @xmath0-partite correlations of an arbitrary multipartite state and introduce degree of correlations as an indicator of genuine @xmath0-partite correlations for an arbitrary multipartite state .",
    "the postulates apply to correlations in general , hence , in particular , they apply also to genuine multipartite entanglement or genuine multipartite classical correlations .      each measure or indicator of genuine @xmath0-partite correlations for an @xmath0-partite state should satisfy the following postulates :    * postulate 1 . * _ if an @xmath0-partite state does not have genuine @xmath0-partite correlations and one adds a party in a product state then the resulting @xmath3 partite state does not have genuine @xmath0-partite correlations . _",
    "* postulate 2 . * _ if an @xmath0-partite state does not have genuine @xmath0-partite correlations then local operations and unanimous postselection ( which mathematically correspond to the operation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of particles and each @xmath6 is trace non - increasing operation acting on @xmath7-th party s subsystem ) can not generate genuine @xmath0-partite correlations . _",
    "* postulate 3 . * _ if an @xmath0-partite state does not have genuine @xmath0-partite correlations then if one party splits his system into two , i.e. sends part of his system to new party which is product with the remainder of the system then the resulting @xmath3-partite state does not have genuine @xmath3-partite correlations .",
    "_    one can also require ( compare postulate 2 ) for each measure @xmath8 of genuine @xmath0-partite correlations that it does not increase on average under local opertions , i.e.    @xmath9    where @xmath10 are krauss operators acting on @xmath11-th subsystem satisfying @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "it seems that this requirement should be added to postulates of henderson and vedral for measures of classical bipartite correlations @xcite .",

    "* the postulates apply also to entanglement .",

    "we proceed in a standard way @xcite , i.e. we say that a state @xmath28 has genuine @xmath0-partite entanglement , if it is not a mixture of pure states that do not have genuine @xmath0-partite entanglement .",
    "thus , to rule out correlations that do not represent entanglement , we can add fourth postulate , saying , that by mixing states which do not have @xmath0-partite entanglement , we can not obtain genuine @xmath0-partite entanglement .",
    "we introduce the concept of degree of correlations .",
    "we do not define it first but rather require that it should satisfy the following postulates :    * postulate 1@xmath29 . * _ if one adds a party in a product state with the remainder of the system then degree of correlations can not change . _    * postulate 2@xmath29 . *",

    "before we show that covariance does not satisfy postulate 2 we present a purification protocol which allows the distillation of w states from certain mixed state .",
    "the protocol consists of two steps . in the first step each party performs a measurement on his particle  the so called local filtering @xcite .",
    "the measurements performed by all parties are independent , i.e. they are not conditioned on the results of the measurements performed by other parties . in the second step the parties postselect a state .",

    "in this section we investigate the relation between multipartite correlations and the amount of work that can be extracted from the environment @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that two parties share a quantum state @xmath104 .",
    "it is well known that this state can be used to extract work from the environment in many different ways .",
    "we consider two scenarios . in the first one",
    "the parties are allowed to perform closed local operations , i.e. , they can perform local unitary operations and local dephasing ( clo ) . in the second one they are allowed to perform closed local operations and send classical communication , i.e. send subsystem down a completely dephasing channel ( clocc ) .",
    "if for the state @xmath104 the parties can extract more work with clocc than with clo then the state @xmath104 has classical correlations .",
    "let us now consider multipartite states . by analogy",
    "we expect that if the parties can extract more work with clocc and with sending classical information across any bipartite cut than with clocc and without sending classical information across at least one cut then the state has genuine multipartite classical correlations .",
    "the difference between extractable work in those two scenarios minimized overall bipartite cuts we shall denote by @xmath105 .",
    "* example 1 . * here we compare the amount of work extractable with the use of an equal mixture of two tripartite @xmath77 states when three parties cooperate , i.e. , there is classical communication across any cut , and when two parties cooperate , i.e. , there is not classical communication across one cut . let us first suppose that three parties cooperate .",
    "if the parties dephase their qubits in @xmath106 basis and the first two parties send their qubits to the third party ( this is equivalent to sending qubits down a completely dephasing channel ) then the third party will hold the state @xmath107 he can now extract @xmath108 bits of work .",
    "another protocol is the following : one party measures in a chosen basis , and tells the result to other parties , who then draw work from the resulting pure state they share .",
    "if the basis is @xmath109 , the result is the same as above .",
    "the complementary basis @xmath110 gives @xmath111 , while the optimal basis is @xmath112 , providing @xmath113 bits of work .",
    "we do not know , whether by general clocc protocol one can extract more work .",
    "let us now suppose that only two parties cooperate , i.e. the first and the second one .",
    "the reduced state of the third party is maximally mixed state and he can not extract any work at all . the reduced state of the first two parties is bell diagonal state @xmath114 where @xmath115 if the first party dephase his qubit in @xmath116 basis , where @xmath117 he can now extract @xmath118 bits of work , where @xmath119 is binary entropy .",
    "this is maximal work which can be extracted with help of one - way classical communication even if one takes into account povms and asymptotic limit of many copies @xcite .",
    "however , again , it is not known if one can extract more work with help of two - way classical communication .    to summarize , we showed , that if the communication through a : bc cut is allowed , then we can extract at least @xmath113 bits of work , while if it is not allowed , we were able to provide a protocol which extracts @xmath120 bits of work ( this concerns all possible cuts , as the state is permutationally symmetric ) .",
    "if the latter protocol were optimal , we would have @xmath121 .",
    "this supports existence of genuine tripartite correlations in the state .",
    "* example 2 .",
    "* on the other hand if the parties can extract the same amount of work with clocc and with sending classical information across any bipartite cut than with clocc and without sending classical information across at least one cut then we can not conclude that the state does not have genuine multipartite classical correlations .",
    "let us consider the following tripartite state @xmath122 if three parties cooperate they can extract one bit of work .",
    "however if only the first and the second party cooperate they can also extract one bit of work . on the other hand",
    "the state is non - product across any bipartite cut and according to definition 2 it has genuine tripartite classical correlations .",
    "the above two examples show that on one hand @xmath105 can indicate multipartite correlations , on the other hand it may vanish , even though the state is non - product against any cut .",
    "this is analogous to behavior of some entanglement measures : e.g. distillable entanglement can vanish for states despite they are entangled .",
    "thus @xmath105 quantifies some particular type of genuine multipartite correlations , which may be absent in some states even though they contain genuinely multipartite correlations .",
    "let us note that the above property of @xmath105 is similar to covariance , which disappears for state , even though it has genuine multipartite correlations with respect to some other criteria .",
    "one basic difference is however , that covariance can be positive even for states such as product of epr pairs @xmath123 which quite obviously do not represent multipartite entanglement ( example of such covariances are those of pauli matrices in cases when pairs of the same pauli matrices are measured on each of the epr pair ) .",
    "moreover , we believe ( though have not proven ) that @xmath105 would satisfy our postulates , i.e. having been zero for some state , it will not go up under the operations described in the formulation of the postulates , while covariance , as we have shown in previous sections violates two postulates .",
    "in conclusion we have proposed reasonable postulates which each measure or indicator of genuine multipartite correlations ( or genuine multipartite entanglement ) should satisfy .",
    "we also introduced degree of correlations which gives partial characterization of multipartite correlations .",
    "we have shown that covariance does not satisfy proposed postulates and it can not be used as an indicator of genuine multipartite classical correlations . in particular , our postulates show that the claim that there exist genuine @xmath0-partite quantum correlations without genuine @xmath0-partite classical correlations is not justified . as a by - product we obtain a protocol of distillation of w states from a wide class of states .",
    "finally we propose a candidate for a measure of genuine multipartite correlations based on work that can be drawn from local environments by means a multipartite state .",
    "we hope that our results , especially the proposed postulates , will allow to develop understanding and quantitative description of genuine multipartite correlations .",
