    "the radio contours at both frequencies are very similar , and both are well correlated to the infrared emission .",
    "there is only a slight difference in morphology between the infrared and radio with the radio emission being filled - in , and the infrared emission more shell - like with a central cavity .",
    "the contours of 4.9 ghz emission shown in the image on the right give a diameter of approximately 2  ( 2 pc at d = 3.5 kpc ) for dbcl23 .",

    "there are double emission peaks separated by about 30  visible in the radio and infrared emission .",
    "the location of these peaks in the radio emission is offset from the peaks in the infrared emission .",
    "examination of figures [ fig1]-[fig7 ] reveal some overall trends for the ism surrounding the candidate clusters : ( 1 ) in all but two sources , the infrared emission ( 3.6 and 8 @xmath9 m ) extends beyond the associated radio emission .",
    "the two exceptions to this are bd84 and db7 , for which the 4.9 ghz emission extends farther than the infrared emission ; ( 2 ) the morphology of the infrared emission for the cluster sources bd52 , bd84 , and dbcl23 is shell - like with a cavity and bright emission along the edges .",
    "the radio emission in bd52 , bd84 , and dbcl23 is also more symmetric and roughly follows the infrared emission .",
    "the shell - like morphology at both radio and infrared wavelengths allows for a more in - depth analysis to be carried out for these three sources (  5.1 ) ; ( 3 ) on the other hand , bd65 , bd95 , and db7 are more complex and less symmetric in morphology at radio and infrared wavelengths ; and ( 4 ) the peak intensity seen in the radio emission is offset from the peak in the infrared emission .",
    "this trend is also noticeable in the slice analysis performed on the three cluster candidates bd52 , dbcl23 , and bd84 ( see  5.1 ) .",
    "we can estimate the physical properties of the radio continuum emission by examining the flux density of each source .",
    "flux densities have been measured within the contour representing 3 times the rms level at 4.9 ghz as seen in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "approximate angular sizes have also been determined from the full width at zero intensity of slices taken across each source .",
    "the 3@xmath14 contour at 4.9 ghz was used to delineate the edge of the sources .",
    "the integrated flux density and angular size values are reported in table [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "based on the radio continuum parameters , physical properties of the ionized gas associated with the candidate clusters have been derived using the formulation of @xcite . in using these formulae , a uniform density , spherical , ionization bounded h ii region with an electron temperature of 10,000 k and an abundance of ionized helium to hydrogen of 0.1 is assumed .",
    "table [ tbl-4 ] presents the derived quantities from the radio continuum parameters shown in table [ tbl-3 ] . due to",
    "flux missing from a couple of the sources in the 8.5 ghz observations , an accurate measure of the flux density could not be obtained , thereby preventing a useful analysis at this frequency . using the formulae ,",
    "we derive a linear radius of the equivalent sphere for the h ii region ( r ) , electron density ( n@xmath15 ) , emission measure ( em ) , total mass of ionized gas ( m@xmath10 ) , and the lyman continuum photon flux ( n@xmath16 ) . the lyman continuum photon flux is the rate of photons emitted capable of ionizing the surrounding hydrogen .",
    "this value provides a measure of the cluster s power by quantifying its ability to impact the surrounding gas .",
    "the authors acknowledge that the sources presented in this study are not well described by a uniform density sphere .",
    "however , past studies ( most notably the work done by @xcite ) have shown h ii region properties based on radio continuum emission to have relatively limited model dependence . @xcite",
    "compared three models to describe the radio continuum structure of 11 galactic h ii regions .",
    "physical parameters were derived from the models using different geometries ( homogeneous sphere and a spherical gaussian ) as well as by using peak properties in the continuum intensity maps .",
    "comparison between the three models showed no systematic differences in the derived electron density and emission measure , and resulted in an overall scatter of 15@xmath17 between modeled parameters .",
    "in addition , the ionization properties which are of greatest interest in this analysis are a function of frequency , electron temperature , distance , and flux density , all of which are model independent .",
    "the main challenge lies in accurately measuring the flux density .",
    "@xcite discovered there could be differences in measured flux density of up to @xmath650@xmath17 for extended sources , which would result in about a 50@xmath17 difference in derived ionizing flux .",
    "however , the motivation of this work is an order of magnitude comparison of ionizing photon fluxes between the sources in this study and known massive clusters in the galaxy .",
    "therefore , the results of this analysis are adequate for the primary goal of this study .",
    "it should be emphasized that the physical quantities reported in table [ tbl-4 ] derived from the radio continuum parameters are meant to be used for relative comparison .",
    "the last column in table [ tbl-4 ] gives an estimate of the spectral type for each cluster based on our calculated lyman continuum photon fluxes and model stellar atmospheres derived by @xcite .",
    "no correction for extinction was made for these estimates .",
    "the stellar spectral types given are the types that would be assigned to a single ionizing source which produces the observed lyman continuum flux .",
    "it is recognized that the ionizing photon rate calculated for the stellar clusters most likely arises from more than one cluster member , and not a single ionizing source of the estimated spectral type .",
    "however , the estimate allows for a comparison between the results of this analysis and those determined in previous studies . in general , there was close agreement between the estimated spectral types indicating these results are consistent with past observations ( e.g. bd95 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the physical parameters derived in table [ tbl-4 ] show variation in physical characteristics of the h ii regions associated with the cluster candidate sources .",

    "bd84 , bd95 , db7 , and dbcl23 have intermediate masses averaging around @xmath650 m@xmath10 , whereas bd65 contains a remarkable 2800 m@xmath10 of ionized gas .",
    "the lyman continuum photon fluxes spread over two orders of magnitude from @xmath610@xmath20 s@xmath12 to 10@xmath21 s@xmath12 with an average of @xmath66@xmath710@xmath22 s@xmath12 .",
    "this spread in ionizing photon rates corresponds to a spread in stellar spectral type from early b - type to mid o - type .",
    "the majority of the candidate sources have lyman continuum photon fluxes that would be produced by single b0 type star .    in this candidate cluster comparison",
    ", bd65 stands out as having greater values for most derived parameters .",
    "it clearly has the largest linear radius of 9.1 pc , much greater than the other clusters average of @xmath62 pc .",
    "similarly , bd65 has an h ii mass that is nearly 70 times greater than the average of the other clusters ionized mass .",
    "bd65 has the greatest lyman continuum photon flux of 3.5@xmath710@xmath21 s@xmath12 , corresponding to an ionizing source of spectral type o3v .",
    "the physical paramters of the h ii regions associated with these clusters depend on the distance .",
    "therefore , the discrepancy in distance estimates to bd65 implies the physical properties derived would be less extreme if a smaller distance was adopted .",
    "for example , at a distance of 4.9 kpc ( @xcite ) bd65 has a linear radius of 4.5 pc , an ionized mass of 490 m@xmath10 , and a lyman continuum photon flux of 8.8@xmath710@xmath22 s@xmath12 . even at this smaller distance bd65",

    "@xcite performed an analysis on infrared dust bubbles using radio and mid - infrared data for bubbles in the galactic plane which led to a generalized picture of infrared bubbles as ionized gas with hot dust surrounded by a pdr containing interstellar gas , pahs , and dust .",
    "the inner ionized gas is traced by radio free - free emission , and the thermal dust continuum can be traced with infrared emission , which often lies outside of the region of radio emission .",

    "the 8 @xmath9 m emission exhibits the same double peaked structure , but peaks at @xmath6100  and 315  along the slice .",
    "this plot shows that the majority of the radio emission is contained within the 8 @xmath9 m emission indicating that the ionized gas lies primarily interior to the infrared shell ( thermal dust ) .",

    "the difference between this emission and the emission peaks at 5.8 and 8 @xmath9 m is likely due to the addition of pah features in the peaks , which delineate the edge of the pdr around the cluster .",

    "the dip in intensity between the emission peaks at these wavelengths is likely due to hot dust with the omission of pahs .",

    "the 8 @xmath9 m emission has peaks on either side of the radio emission , @xmath690  and 130 .",
    "a possible interpretation is that the h ii emission indicated by the peak is surrounded by a shell of pahs and warm dust indicated by the two infrared emission peaks .",
    "as is evident in figure [ fig4 ] , the radio continuum emission is more extended than the infrared emission in bd84 .",
    "this is only slightly apparent in the slices in figure [ fig13 ] where the 4.9 ghz emission is visible above the 8 @xmath9 m emission just outside the two peaks .",

    "bd84 differs in this respect with a single peak of radio emission near the cluster surrounded by more diffuse extended emission .",
    "lower intensity emission at 5.8 and 8 @xmath9 m between two emission peaks for all three sources indicates pahs are probably being destroyed by stellar radiation near the clusters .",

    "<S> the galaxy appears to be richer in young , massive stellar clusters than previously known , due to advances in infrared surveys which have uncovered deeply embedded regions of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> young , massive clusters can significantly impact the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) and hence radio observations can also be an important tracer of their activity . </S>",
    "<S> several hundred cluster candidates are now known by examining survey data . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on multiwavelength observations of six of these candidates in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we carried out 4.9 and 8.5 ghz vla observations of the radio emission associated with these clusters to obtain the physical characteristics of the surrounding gas , including the lyman continuum photon flux and ionized gas mass . _ </S>",
    "<S> spitzer _ infrared array camera observations were also made of these regions , and provide details on the stellar population as well as the dust continuum and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission . </S>",
    "<S> when compared to the known young , massive clusters in the galaxy , the six cluster candidates have less powerful lyman ionizing fluxes and ionize less of the h ii mass in the surrounding ism . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , these cluster candidates appear to be more consistent with intermediate - mass clusters ( 10@xmath0 - 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 ) . </S>"
