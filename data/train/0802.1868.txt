    "quantum phase transitions in itinerant electron systems continue to ignite considerable interest.@xcite these transitions are usually induced by varying a non - thermal control parameter such as pressure or chemical potential at zero temperature , so that no classical fluctuations occur and the transition is driven exclusively by quantum effects . in many physical situations",
    ", a line of finite temperature second order phase transitions in the phase diagram terminates at a quantum critical point at @xmath4 . in such cases quantum fluctuations influence the system also at finite temperatures altering measurable quantities such as the shape of the phase boundary .",
    "consequently , in a complete description of the system at finite @xmath5 , quantum and thermal fluctuations have to be accounted for simultaneously .",
    "the conventional renormalization group ( rg ) approach to quantum criticality in itinerant electron systems @xcite relies on the assumption that it is sensible to integrate out fermionic degrees of freedom from the functional integral representation of the partition function and then to expand the resulting effective action in powers of the order parameter alone .",
    "this approach has been questioned for magnetic phase transitions associated with spontaneous breaking of continuous spin rotation invariance , since integrating the fermions results in singular interactions of the order parameter field .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we focus on quantum phase transitions to phases with broken _ discrete _ symmetry .",
    "we analyze quantum and classical fluctuations in the _ symmetry - broken _ phase with an ising - like order parameter near a quantum critical point .",
    "our calculations are based on a set of coupled flow equations obtained by approximating the exact flow equations of the one - particle irreducible version of the functional rg .",
    "quantum and classical ( thermal ) fluctuations are treated on equal footing .",
    "the functional rg has been applied extensively to classical critical phenomena,@xcite where it provides a unified description of @xmath6-symmetric scalar models , including two - dimensional systems .",
    "the classical ising universality class has been analyzed in refs .  .",
    "the functional rg is obviously also a suitable framework for treating quantum criticality.@xcite in our approach , we can compute the rg flow in any region of the phase diagram , including the region governed by non - gaussian critical fluctuations .",
    "this allows comparison between the true transition line and the ginzburg line , which so far has been used as an estimate of the former .",
    "@xcite specifically , we capture the strong - coupling behavior emergent in the vicinity of the transition line as well as the correct classical fixed - point for @xmath7 , including the anomalous dimension of the order parameter field .",
    "our results may be applied to commensurate charge - density - waves , pomeranchuk transitions @xcite which spontaneously break the discrete point group lattice symmetry , and to magnetic transitions with ising symmetry , provided the transitions are continuous at low temperatures .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section ii we introduce hertz s @xcite effective action , adapted to the symmetry - broken phase , which serves as a starting point for the subsequent analysis . in section",
    "iii we describe the functional rg method and its application in the present context , and subsequently derive the rg flow equations . in section",
    "iv we present a solution of the equations in the case @xmath4 .",
    "section v contains numerical results for the finite @xmath5 phase diagram in the region with broken symmetry .",
    "different cases are discussed , distinguished by the dimensionality @xmath8 and the dynamical exponent @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , we compare the @xmath7 line with the ginzburg line , thus providing an estimate of the critical region size . in section",
    "vi we summarize and discuss the results .",
    "the starting point of the standard rg approach to quantum critical phenomena in itinerant electron systems is the hertz action . @xcite it can be derived from a microscopic hamiltonian by applying a hubbard - stratonovich transformation to the path - integral representation of the partition function and subsequently integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting action is then expanded in powers of the order parameter field , usually to quartic order .",
    "the validity of this expansion is dubious in several physically interesting cases , in particular for magnetic transitions with su(2)-symmetry , since the integration over gapless fermionic modes can lead to singular effective interactions of the order parameter field , which may invalidate the conventional power counting .",
    "@xcite such complications probably do not affect transitions in the charge channel and magnetic transitions with ising symmetry .",
    "there are several indications that singularities cancel in that case , namely the cancellation of singularities in effective interactions upon symmetrization of fermion loops,@xcite and the cancellation of non - analyticities in susceptibilities .",
