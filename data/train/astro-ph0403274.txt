    "the tycho supernova remnant ( snr ) is known as a remnant of a type ia supernova that occurred in the year 1572 @xcite . as one of the few historical snrs",
    ", the remnant has been widely studied in various wavebands . in radio continuum , it shows a shell morphology with clearly defined outer boundary and clumpy inner structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recent high resolution x - ray images also exhibit similar features .",
    "@xcite derived a shock velocity by modelling the optical spectrum from a fast nonradiative shock and compared it with an optical proper motion @xcite , giving an estimated distance of @xmath0 kpc .",
    "other independent estimates give similar distances @xcite .",
    "it is , however , noted that there has been controversy in interpreting the  absorption data , giving a different distance .",
    "this will be discussed in ",
    "[ distance ] .",
    "observations show evidence that tycho is interacting with ambient dense clouds toward its northeast ( ne ) direction .",
    "@xcite has studied its expansion using a 10-year - lap vla data and found that the ne area , which is farthest from the geometrical center of the snr , is currently moving slowest , suggesting that the remnant is expanding into a higher density medium .",
    "@xcite has conducted a  absorption study towards the remnant and suggested that tycho is currently interacting with a dense  concentration in the ne ( @xmath1  @xmath2  ) which locally slows down the expansion of the shock front .",
    "there are other observations that also suggest its interaction with inhomogeneous environment .    from the fcrao @xmath3co survey of the outer galaxy @xcite",
    ", we have identified molecular clouds which could be associated with tycho ( figure [ fig : tycho_fcrao ] ) .",
    "they are arc - shaped and the inner boundary roughly traces the ne rim of tycho .",
    "the morphology of the molecular clouds suggests physical association with tycho .",
    "we have conducted high - resolution @xmath3co j=@xmath4 line observations and present the results in this _ letter_.",
    "the observation was carried out for a total of 20 hours during 2003 january 1113 using the nobeyama 45 m radio telescope .",
    "the bears focal - plane receiver system was used to cover @xmath5  area centered at tycho whose diameter is @xmath6 .",
    "hpbw of the 45 m telescope at @xmath3co ( j=1 - 0 ) is about @xmath7 and we have mapped the region with a 8  grid spacing .",
    "pointing accuracy was quite good during the observing run and we estimate it to be better than 5 .",
    "velocity resolution of @xmath8 @xmath2  was achieved using 1024 channel autocorrelator as a backend .",
    "the data were calibrated using the standard procedure with _",
    "newstar _ software developed by naoj .",
    "exposure time is not uniform , leading to varying noises .",
    "the ne portion of the image has the most significant s / n ( @xmath9 ) while the inner part of the remnant has a poorer s / n ratio ( @xmath10 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : tycho_channelmap_nobeyama1 ] , we present channel maps in gray scale together with the radio continuum showing the boundary of tycho .",
    "there is virtually no @xmath11  emission at @xmath12  ( except from the gas in the local arm ) and most of the emission is between @xmath13 with some faint emission localized in the northern part of the remnant at @xmath14 .",
    "the emission is generally from regions surrounding the remnant . in particular , at velocities between @xmath15 to @xmath16 , the emitting area appears to be in contact with the remnant along its ne boundary .",
    "this is more clearly seen in figure  [ fig : tycho_v63_nobeyama ] , the integrated intensity map over @xmath17 . in particular , at the location of optical knot g where the radio continuum boundary is deformed and the radio expansion is slowest , molecular clumps are touching the radio boundary .",
    "the ambient environment of tycho is not homogeneous as clearly revealed by the slower expansion of the ne rim .",
    "the morphology of the molecular cloud suggests their physical interaction .",
    "we discuss their physical association in the following sections .",
    "the distance to tycho has been estimated by several authors using independent methods @xcite .",
    "most estimates agree on a distance of @xmath18 kpc except for the estimate based on   absorption observations . applying the  absorption technique to tycho",
    "is not straightforward due to the non - circular motion of the gas in the perseus arm .",
    "the peculiar velocity field of the perseus arm is well known , e.g. , radial velocities of regions and ob stars in the perseus arm are lower than those derived from photometric / spectroscopic distances .",
    "the widely accepted model is the `` two armed spiral shock '' ( tass ) model proposed by @xcite . in this model , the galactic spiral pattern is visualized by a large scale shock residing in the galactic density wave .",
    "multi - value velocity - distance relation is naturally expected in this scenario , and , toward tycho ( @xmath19 ) , the radial velocity is expected to drop abruptly from @xmath20 to @xmath21 @xmath2  at the shock front at 2.2 kpc and slowly increase to @xmath22  at 2.8 kpc , after which it slowly decreases . the velocity of the most negative absorption feature towards tycho is around @xmath23 with weak absorption at @xmath24 . @xcite attributed the absorption to the gas behind the spiral shock and placed tycho just behind the large scale spiral shock , at a distance of @xmath25  kpc .",
    "they noted that there is little absorption between @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xmath2  which was considered as evidence for tycho not being far beyond the spiral shock front . on the other hand , has argued that it should be placed at a distance of @xmath28 kpc where almost circular rotation is applicable .",
    "one of their arguments was that the velocity of the most negative absorption feature ( @xmath24 ) is too low compared to the model - predicted shock velocity ( @xmath29 @xmath2 ) .",
    "the velocity structure in the perseus arm , however , is rather highly dependent on the galactic latitude .",
    "this trend can be clearly seen from the recent fcrao co survey of the outer galaxy @xcite  and drao low resolution  survey @xcite .",
    "the peak velocity of @xmath11  associated with perseus arm in the region of @xmath30  is around @xmath31 at @xmath32 , but systematically decreases to @xmath33  at @xmath34  and further decreases for higher latitudes .",
    "if these @xmath11  molecules are associated with the high density regime behind the spiral shock front , as is likely to , the shock velocity itself should have a similar trend , although it is not explicitly accounted for in the tass model .",
    "data can be described in a similar way .",
    "therefore , if we account the @xmath35-dependent behavior of the velocity field , the absorption velocity could be as low as @xmath36 even if tycho is just behind the shock front , and we consider that the  absorption experiments are consistent with tycho being at the near side of the perseus arm .",
    "the velocity of the co molecular cloud in the ne area of tycho is @xmath37 km / s , which is slightly lower than the minimum velocity of the  absorption feature .",
    "the cloud , and other clouds in figure [ fig : tycho_channelmap_nobeyama1 ] , however , seem to be part of a large - scale distribution of molecular gas presumably representing the high - density ridge behind the spiral shock .",
    "the co emission between @xmath38 and @xmath39 is generally confined within a velocity interval of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this is much narrower than that of the  gas ( @xmath42 ) , whose peak velocity is also blue - shifted from the peak of @xmath11 .",
    "these different characteristics of @xmath11  and   can be explained within the frame of tass model where @xmath11  clouds mostly correspond to the high - density region just behind the spiral shock .",
    "we have compared the @xmath43 distribution of @xmath11  around @xmath32 with the theoretical prediction ( shock ridge ) and found them to be well matched .",
    "hence , it is likely that the distances to the tycho snr and to the molecular clouds surrounding it are comparable .",
    "optical filaments have been found in tycho @xcite .",
    "the filaments are located along the ne boundary of the remnant , where interaction with a molecular cloud is likely ( figure [ fig : tycho_v63_nobeyama ] ) .",
    "the emission is predominantly hydrogen balmer emission and is believed to originate from a collisionless nonradiative shock , characterized by broad and narrow emission components whose velocity distribution represent that of postshock and preshock gas , respectively @xcite .",
    "the expansion velocities of these filaments , which are compatible with radio expansion rate at this region ( @xmath45 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is relatively small ( @xmath46 ) compared to the other parts of the remnant .",
    "the implied large preshock density suggests its association with the molecular cloud . @xcite",
    "obtained high - resolution echelle spectrum of knot g ( figure [ fig : tycho_v63_nobeyama ] ) and their observed central velocity is @xmath47 . for comparison ,",
    "most of the @xmath11  emission around tycho is between @xmath48 and @xmath41 , and the @xmath11  line profile near knot g , fitted with gaussian , gives a line center of @xmath49  and a fwhm of @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , there is a non - negligible velocity difference of @xmath51 between the h alpha filament and the @xmath11  cloud .",
    "even if we consider the fwhm of @xmath11  as a possible error , the difference is greater than @xmath52 which is significant .",
    "the velocity of the narrow h@xmath44  component of a non - radiative shock should represent that of the gas entering the shock .",
    "this implies two possibilities .",
    "one is that the gases responsible for @xmath11  and h@xmath44  have initially different velocities .",
    "this could be due to a turbulent motion behind the spiral shock or some kinematical effects associated with the evolution of the progenitor star or the sn explosion itself .",
    "but these seem rather unlikely because there is virtually no @xmath11  emission above @xmath41  and the actual velocity difference considering a projection could be much larger ( see next section ) .",
    "the remaining possibility is that the gas experiences an acceleration before the excitation by the shock .",
    "we further discuss about it in the following .",
    "a handful of remnants show non - radiative shock emission like tycho .",
    "the width of the narrow line has been a puzzle since it is unusually large for neutral hydrogen and does not vary much from remnant to remnant . for most of the remnants , it ranges between 30 and 50 @xmath2 , while sn 1006 , which is the fastest ( @xmath53 ) , has a slightly smaller value of about 20 @xmath2 .",
    "various physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain this line width @xcite .",
    "although the cr precursor and/or fast neutral precursor scenario has been regarded as the most likely case @xcite ,  firm evidence is yet to be found .",
    "some of the proposed mechanisms , which include a interaction with heavy particles ( like protons ) , also predict a systematic acceleration of the gas before their excitation .",
    "we propose that the velocity difference between h@xmath44  and @xmath11  can be explained by this gas acceleration .",
    "observed peak velocity of the broad h@xmath44  component is red - shifted by @xmath54 from that of the narrow one , indicating that the shock is not completely edge on @xcite . with a shock velocity @xmath55 ( fluid velocity @xmath56 ) , viewing angle is estimated to be about @xmath57 .",
    "if the gas is accelerated , the h@xmath44  narrow component will be red - shifted from the unperturbed medium , which is qualitatively consistent with our interpretation where @xmath11  typifies the velocity of the unperturbed medium .",
    "the observed velocity difference of @xmath58 in @xmath59   then implies that the actual acceleration is about @xmath60 .",
    "one possibility to explain the velocity difference is a momentum transfer by collisions with fast protons after crossing the shock .",
    "but , as @xcite  has showed , a lifetime of the hydrogen atom is very short and only a moderate amount of acceleration ( @xmath61 ) is possible .",
    "we consider two preshock mechanisms which might account for this acceleration .",
    "broadening of the narrow component is well explained by a cr precursor @xcite  and acceleration of the preshock gas is also theoretically well expected ( see * ? ? ?",
    "for a cr dominated shock , it is suggested that the preshock gas can be accelerated to the significant fraction of the shock velocity .",
    "@xcite  has applied this shock model to the balmer - dominated filaments in cygnus loop . according to their model , the preshock gas is accelerated to velocities close to the shock velocity . for the case of tycho",
    ", the smaller amount of acceleration , compared to the shock velocity , indicates that the cosmic ray contribution is not dominant .",
    "this is consistent with recent x - ray results @xcite where no significant temperature drop due to a possible cosmic ray acceleration is observed .",
    "the radio spectral index ( @xmath62 ) of tycho is known to be steeper ( @xmath63 at @xmath64 ) than what is expected from a test particle theory ( @xmath65 ) , and it is suggested that tycho may have somewhat strongly modified shock .",
    "but , the spectral index varies over the remnant @xcite and knot g region ( filament i in @xcite ) has the flattest spectral index of @xmath66 , which might be another indication for the interaction with molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "although tycho may have strongly modified shock in a large scale , it does not seem to apply to areas interacting with molecular clouds .",
    "there has been little theoretical study on the fast neutral precursor compared to the cosmic ray precursor .",
    "@xcite calculated the h@xmath44  profile from a @xmath67 non - radiative shock with a fast neutral precursor , but due to their narrow parameter range , direct comparison with our observation is not available and there is no indication of the velocity shift of the narrow component in their line profiles .",
    "calculations for higher shock velocity and lower pre - ionization fraction is necessary .",
    "the study of balmer - dominated filaments in snrs has given us much information about the shock structure .",
    "the velocity of an unperturbed preshock medium is an invaluable observational ingredient for fully understanding underlying shock structure . in tycho , a velocity shift between an ambient molecular cloud , which is believed to be the unperturbed preshock gas , and the h@xmath44  filaments has been observed .",
    "although the preshock acceleration was searched for previously , no evidence has obtained before our observation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our observation serves as the first direct evidence for the acceleration of preshock gas by a cosmic ray ( or fast neutral ) precursor .",
    "we , however , note that our conclusion is based on the single velocity measurement and more observations are needed to test it .",
    "there has been not much study on the structure of collisionless shocks propagating into molecular clouds .",
    "but most of the volume of a molecular cloud may be occupied by low density ( @xmath68 ) interclump medium , and the structure would not much differ from that in atomic medium . the molecules are supposed to be dissociated within a precursor either by radiation from postshock region or hot electrons .",
    "the dissociation rate of @xmath69  is only slightly larger than ionization rate of the hydrogen atom , and complete dissociation of @xmath69  may not happen since they occupy more dense region .",
    "the velocity of the transmitted shock into a molecular clump can be sufficiently low to be radiative , but currently there is no sign of radiative shock in tycho , presumably because the shock is propagating into the low - density outskirts of the molecular cloud .",
    "future study should address these issues together with the nature of cosmic ray acceleration for a high - velocity ( @xmath70 ) shock propagating into a molecular cloud .",
    "we would like to thank parviz ghavamian for kindly providing the h@xmath44  data and useful comments . we thank john raymond , hyesung kang , christopher mckee and gloria dubner for helpful informations and comments .",
    "we also thank to the anonymous referee for valuable comments , which helped us to improve this paper .",
