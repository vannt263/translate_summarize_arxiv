    "it has become clear , however , that this effect can not be explained within a model of non - interacting electrons .",
    "ambegaokar and eckern ( ae ) @xcite were the first to examine the effect of electron - electron interactions on mesoscopic persistent currents : they realized that , to first order in the screened coulomb - interaction , the dominant contribution to the disorder averaged persistent current can be obtained from the two diagrams shown in fig .

    ", the corresponding persistent current @xmath4 can be obtained from the thermodynamic relation @xmath5    in a bulk metal at high densities the bare coulomb - interaction @xmath6 is strongly screened .",
    "a simple way to take the screening into account diagrammatically is the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . following this procedure ,",
    "ae approximated the effective interaction ( in the imaginary frequency formalism ) as follows @xmath7 for momentum transfers @xmath8 small compared with the inverse elastic mean free path @xmath9 , and for frequency transfers @xmath10 small compared with the inverse elastic lifetime @xmath11 the disorder averaged polarization is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath14 is the average density of states at the fermi energy ( per spin ) in the absence of interactions .",
    "note that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the volume of the system and @xmath17 is the average level spacing ( per spin ) at the fermi energy .",
    "it turns out that both diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : ae ] are dominated by momentum transfers of the order of the fermi momentum @xmath18 , which for a metallic system is large compared with @xmath9 .",
    "( [ eq : rpa ] ) and ( [ eq : pol ] ) are therefore not suitable for a quantitatively accurate calculation of persistent currents . to make some progress analytically ,",

    "then diffusive motion is only possible along the circumference . at temperature",

    "the coupling constant @xmath33 can be identified with the dimensionless effective interaction in the cooper channel to first order in perturbation theory .",
    "ae estimated @xmath34 , assuming that the validity of the rpa can be extended to momentum transfers of the order of @xmath18 . however , higher order ladder diagrams in the cooper channel strongly reduce the effective interaction , so that @xmath35 is a more realistic estimate @xcite for the cu - rings in the experiment  @xcite .    in real space eq .",
    "( [ eq : vbar ] ) amounts to replacing the electron - electron interaction by a local effective density - density interaction , @xmath36 more precisely , this replacement means that for distances @xmath37 larger than @xmath38 , the interaction is effectively local . in a recent letter schechter , oreg , imry , and",
    "levinson @xcite pointed out that a different type of effective interaction can possibly lead to a much larger persistent current .",
    "specifically , they used the bcs model to calculate the leading interaction correction to the orbital linear magnetic response and found @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the attractive dimensionless interaction in the bcs model , and the coherence energy @xmath41 is the smaller energy of @xmath42 and the debye energy @xmath43 .",

    "( [ eq : iae ] ) and ( [ eq : imae ] ) , @xmath44 where we have used @xmath45 and retained only the leading logarithmic order .",
    "note that the logarithm is due to the slow decay ( @xmath46 ) of the fourier coefficients @xmath47 of @xmath48 , so that all coefficients with @xmath49 contribute to the linear response .",
    "for @xmath50 the linear magnetic response in the bcs model is parametrically larger than the linear response in the local interaction model .",
    "whether or not this remains true beyond the linear response has not been clarified .",
    "note also that in the bcs model the linear magnetic response is diamagnetic because the effective interaction is attractive ( @xmath51 ) , whereas the linear response in the local interaction model is paramagnetic , corresponding to a repulsive effective interaction ( @xmath52 .",
    "an interesting observation made by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite is that an effective interaction different from the local interaction used by ae can lead to a much larger persistent current , at least for sufficiently small flux @xmath0 , where it is allowed to calculate the current from the linear response .",
    "given the rather crude approximations in the microscopic derivation of the local interaction model , it seems worth while to explore the magnetic response for other types of effective interactions .",
    "a possibility which so far has not been thoroughly analyzed is an interaction which is dominated by small momentum transfers .",
    "note that the assumption that only forward scattering processes ( corresponding to vanishing momentum transfer ) have to be taken into account for a consistent description of the low - energy and long - wavelength properties of normal metals lies at the heart of the landau s fermi liquid theory .",
    "the landau model is in a sense the opposite extreme of the local interaction model , because the effective interaction in the landau model is proportional to a kronecker - delta in momentum space , @xmath53 where the landau parameter @xmath54 can be determined from experiments .",

    "the fact that a gauge transformation replacing charge vertices by current vertices can be used to avoid the explicit calculation of vertex corrections has also been employed in ref.@xcite to calculate the zero bias anomaly in the tunneling density of states of two - dimensional disordered electrons interacting with coulomb forces .",

    "[ fig : as ] ( a ) does not contain any vertex corrections analogous to the diffusion corrections of the vertices in the fock diagams ( b)(d ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the interaction line in the hartree process does not transfer any energy .",

    "interestingly , the anomalously large linear magnetic response in the bcs model given in eq .",

    "thus , the importance of hartree interactions for persistent currents is some extent independent of a specific model for the interaction . for the cu - rings used in the experiment @xcite we estimate @xmath63 , @xmath35 and @xmath108 ; with these values the linear magnetic response due to forward scattering is more than four times larger than the linear response in the local interaction model considered by ae @xcite . to take both contributions into account one",

    "in summary , we have shown that a forward scattering excess interaction , involving a vanishing momentum transfer , yields the dominant contribution to the _ linear _ magnetic response of mesoscopic metal rings for experimentally relevant parameters  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , outside the linear response regime the persistent current is dominated by the term @xmath114 involving large momentum transfers , at least if we use the bulk estimates for @xmath114 and @xmath1 for cu . however , for a mesoscopic disordered cu - ring it is not obvious that the bulk estimates are reliable .",
    "note also that in the bulk the normal fermi liquid is stable as long as @xmath115 , so that for @xmath116 the linear magnetic response in the normal state can be diamagnetic , in spite of the fact that the effective coupling @xmath117 in the cooper channel is positive .",
    "moreover , in the vicinity of an @xmath118-wave pomeranchuk instability @xcite , where @xmath119 and @xmath120 , one should replace @xmath1 by @xmath121 . in this case we predict a strongly enhanced diamagnetic linear response . in fact , the forward scattering channel might then dominate the persistent current even beyond the linear order in the flux @xmath0 . to clarify this point , a better microscopic theory of the effective electron - electron interaction in mesoscopic disordered metals",
    "is necessary . in particular",
    ", a microscopic theory should properly treat the problem of screening in a finite system and incorporate the breakdown of fermi liquid theory in quasi one - dimensional disordered metals at sufficiently low temperatures @xcite .",
