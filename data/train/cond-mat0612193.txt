    "barrier crossing phenomena are ubiquitous and are a central issue in many areas of natural science @xcite . since the reaction coordinate describing the transition across the barrier typically interact with a large number of microscopic degrees of freedom , a useful theory to start with is the construction of a hamiltonian which incorporates the effects of a heat bath environment .",
    "the classical treatment of thermally activated barrier crossing description is naturally accounted for by the generalized langevin equation ( may be nonlinear ) and by the corresponding fokker - planck equation .",
    "following kramers @xcite transition rate can then be calculated from a nonequilibrium steady state solution of the fokker - planck equation describing a constant flux across the potential barrier . over several decades the kramers theory and many of its variants has served as standard paradigms in various problems of physical and chemical kinetics to understand the rate in multidimensional systems in the overdamped and underdamped limits @xcite , effects of anharmonicities @xcite , rate enhancement by parametric fluctuations @xcite , the role of non - gaussian white noise @xcite , role of a relaxing bath @xcite , quantum and semiclassical corrections to classical rate processes @xcite and related similar aspects .",
    "the common feature of overwhelming majority of the aforesaid treatments is that the system is thermodynamically closed , which means that the noise of the medium is of internal origin so that the dissipation and fluctuations gets balanced through the fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "however , in a number of situations the system is thermodynamically open , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the system is driven by an external noise which is independent of system s characteristic damping @xcite . the main feature of the dynamics in this case is the absence of any fluctuation - dissipation relation . while in the former case",
    "a zero current steady state situation is characterized by an equilibrium boltzmann distribution , the corresponding situation in the later case is defined only by a steady state condition , if attainable .",
    "a common approach to study the nonlinear , nonequilibrium systems involves a description in terms of nonlinear stochastic differential equation @xcite . from a microscopic point of view",
    ", the system - reservoir hamiltonian description suggests that the coupling of the system and the reservoir coordinates determines both the noise and the dissipative terms in the langevin equation describing the dynamics of the system .",
    "if the system - bath interaction is linear in the bath coordinates but arbitrary in the system coordinate , the corresponding generalized langevin equation incorporates a multiplicative noise and consequently a nonlinear dissipative term arises due to the nonlinear system - bath interaction @xcite .",
    "a canonical distribution for initial conditions of the bath variables yields a zero average for the fluctuations and the fluctuation - dissipation relation is again maintained @xcite .",
    "however , when the reservoir is modulated by an external noise , it is likely that it induces fluctuations in the polarization of the reservoir @xcite .",
    "since the fluctuations of the reservoir are crucially dependent on the response function , one can envisage a connection between the dissipation of the system and the response function of the reservoir due to the external noise from a microscopic stand point @xcite .",
    "a direct driving of the system usually breaks the fluctuation - dissipation relation and can generate a biased directed motion that are seen in ratchet and molecular motors @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the bath modulation by an external noise agency maintains a thermodynamic consistency relation , an analogue of the fluctuation - dissipation relation of the closed system , as a result of which the well known kramers turnover feature can be restored @xcite .    while the nonequilibrium , nonthermal systems have also been investigated phenomenologically by a number of works in several contexts @xcite , these treatment are mainly concerned with direct driving of the system by an external noise or a time dependent field . in the present paper",
    "we consider a system - reservoir model where the reservoir is modulated by an external noise and the system is nonlinearly coupled to a heat bath thereby resulting a nonlinear , multiplicative generalized langevin equation .",
    "our object here is to explore the role of reservoir response on the system s dynamics and to calculate the generalized escape rate from a metastable state for a nonequilibrium open system in the presence of multiplicative noise",
    ".    a number of different situations depicting the modulation of the heat bath may be physically relevant .",
    "as for example , one may experimentally study the reversible isomerization of _ cis_-butene to _ trans_-butene , _ cis_-butene @xmath0 _ trans_-butene . in terms of the reaction rate theory both isomers represent the two stable local minima of the potential energy landscape and are separated by the activation energy which one stable configuration ( _ cis _ or _ trans _ ) needs to overcome to be converted into its isomeric form . to observe the effect of external stochastic modulation",
    "one can carry out the experiment in a photochemically active solvent ( the heat bath ) where the solvent is under the influence of external monochromatic light with fluctuating intensity of a wavelength which is absorbed solely by the solvent molecules . as a result of it",
    "the modulated solvent heats up due to the conversion of light energy into heat energy by radiationless relaxation process and a effective temperature like quantity develops due to the constant input of energy . since the fluctuations in the light intensity results in the polarization of the solvent molecules , the effective reaction field around the reactants gets modified .",
    "provided the required stationarity of this nonequilibrium open system is maintained the dynamics of the barrier crossing becomes amenable to the present theoretical analysis that follows .    though the dynamics of a brownian particle in a uniform solvent is well - known , it is not very clear when the response of the solvent becomes time dependent , as in a liquid crystal when projected onto an anisotropic stochastic equation of motion or in the diffusion and reaction in supercritical liquids and growth in living polymerization @xcite",
    ". also space - dependent friction is realized from the presence of a stochastic potential in the langevin equation @xcite .",
    "an exact fokker - planck equation for time and space dependent friction was derived by pollak _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "along with these formal developments , the theories of multiplicative noise have found in wide applications in several areas , _",
    "e.g. _ , activated rate processes , stochastic resonance , laser and optics , noise induced transport etc @xcite . in passing we mention that the escape rate for a space dependent friction is just not a theoretical issue but has been a subject of experimental investigation over the last two decades @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section ii , starting from a hamiltonian description of a system nonlinearly coupled to a harmonic reservoir which is modulated externally by a gaussian noise , we have derived the generalized langevin equation with an effective gaussian noise @xmath1 .",
    "the statistical properties of @xmath1 has also been explored . in section iii",
    "we have constructed the corresponding fokker - planck equation , valid for small correlation time , and have derived the generalized kramers rate for moderate to large friction . in section iv , a specific example has been carried out .",
    "both the numerical and analytical results have been analyzed in section v. the paper has been concluded in section vi .",
    "we consider a classical particle of mass @xmath2 nonlinearly coupled to a heat bath consisting of @xmath3 harmonic oscillators driven by an external noise .",
    "the total hamiltonian of such a composite system can be written as @xcite    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the coordinate and the momentum of the system particle , respectively , and @xmath7 is the potential energy of the system .",
    "@xmath8 are the variables for the @xmath9th bath oscillator having frequency @xmath10 and mass @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the coupling constant for the system - bath interaction and @xmath13 is some analytic function of system coordinate .",
    "@xmath14 is the interaction term between the heat bath and the external noise @xmath15 , with the following form :    @xmath16    the type of interaction we have considered between the heat bath and the external noise , @xmath14 is commonly known as the _ dipole interaction _ @xcite . in equation ( [ 2.2 ] ) , @xmath17 denotes the strength of the interaction .",
    "we consider @xmath18 to be a stationary , gaussian noise process with zero mean and arbitrary correlation function    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the external noise strength , @xmath21 is the external noise kernel and @xmath22 implies averaging over the external noise processes .",
    "eliminating the bath degrees of freedom in the usual way @xcite ( and setting @xmath2 and @xmath23 ) we obtain the generalized langevin equation    @xmath24    where    @xmath25    and @xmath26 is the thermal fluctuation generated due to the system - reservoir interaction and is given by    @xmath27.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) , @xmath28 is the fluctuating force generated due to the external stochastic driving @xmath18 and is given by    @xmath29    where    @xmath30    the form of equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) indicates that the system is driven by two forcing terms @xmath26 and @xmath28 , both are multiplicative by a function of system variable @xmath31 .",
    "thus we have obtained a generalized langevin equation with multiplicative noise . to define the statistical properties of @xmath26",
    ", we assume that the initial distribution is one in which the bath is equilibrated at @xmath32 in the presence of the system but in the absence of the external noise agency @xmath18 such that    @xmath33    now at @xmath34 , the external noise agency is switched on and the bath is modulated by @xmath18 .",
    "the system dynamics is governed by equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) , where apart from the internal noise @xmath26 another fluctuating force @xmath28 appears that depends on the external noise @xmath15 .",
    "so we define an effective noise @xmath35 $ ] whose correlation is given by @xcite    @xmath36    along with @xmath37 , where @xmath38 means we have taken two averages independently .",
    "it should be noted that the above equation ( [ 2.9 ] ) is not a fluctuation - dissipation relation due to the appearance of the external noise intensity .",
    "rather it serves as a thermodynamic consistency condition .",
    "the statistical properties of @xmath28 are determined by the normal mode densities of the bath frequencies , the coupling of the system with the bath , the coupling of the bath with the external noise and on the statistical properties of the external noise itself .",
    "equation ( [ 2.7 ] ) is reminiscent of the familiar linear relation between the polarization and external field , where @xmath28 and @xmath18 play the role of the former and later , respectively .",
    "@xmath39 then can be interpreted as a response function of the reservoir due to the external noise @xmath18 .",
    "the structure of @xmath28 suggests that this forcing function , although obtained from an external agency , is different from a direct driving force acting on the system .    to obtain a finite result in the continuum limit ,",
    "the coupling function @xmath40 and @xmath41 are chosen @xcite as @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "consequently @xmath44 and @xmath39 reduces to the following forms :    @xmath45    and    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are constants and @xmath49 is the cutoff frequency of the oscillator .",
    "@xmath50 may be characterized as the correlation time of the bath @xcite .",
    "for @xmath51 we obtain a delta - correlated noise process .",
    "@xmath52 is the density of modes of the heat bath which is assumed to be lorentzian :    @xmath53    this assumption resembles broadly the behavior of the hydrodynamical modes in a macroscopic system @xcite . with these forms of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 we have the expression for @xmath39 and @xmath44 as    @xmath57    from equations ( [ 2.10 ] ) and ( [ 2.11 ] ) we obtain    @xmath58    equation ( [ 2.14 ] ) , an important content of the present model , is independent of @xmath52 .",
    "this expresses how the dissipative kernel @xmath44 depends on the response function @xmath39 of the medium due to the external noise @xmath18 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath18 is a @xmath59-correlated noise , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath60 then the correlation function of @xmath28 will be    @xmath61    where we have neglected the transient terms @xmath62 .",
    "this equation shows how the heat bath dresses the external noise .",
    "though the external noise is a @xmath59-correlated noise , the system encounters it as an ornstein - uhlenbeck noise with same correlation time of the heat bath but with an intensity depending on the coupling @xmath48 and the external noise strength @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the external noise is an ornstein - uhlenbeck process with @xmath63 , the correlation function of @xmath28 is found to be    @xmath64    where we have neglected the transient terms . if the external noise - correlation time be much larger than the internal noise - correlation time , _",

    "_ equation ( [ n3.20 ] ) is the first key result of this paper_. it should be noted that when the noise is purely internal and the system - reservoir coupling is linear , equation ( [ n3.20 ] ) reduces to the generalized kramers equation @xcite ( valid for small correlation time ) .    in kramers original treatment",
    "the dynamics of the brownian particle was governed by markovian random processes . since the work of kramers a number of authors @xcite have extended kramers analysis for the non - markovian case to derive the expression for generalized escape rate . in order to allow ourselves a comparison with fokker - planck equation of other forms",
    "@xcite , we note that the diffusion coefficient in equation ( [ n3.20 ] ) is coordinate dependent .",
    "it is customary to get rid of this coordinate dependence by approximating the coefficients at the barrier top or potential well where we need the steady state solution of equation ( [ n3.20 ] ) .",
    "one may also use mean field solution of equation ( [ n3.20 ] ) obtained by neglecting the fluctuation terms and putting appropriate stationary condition in the diffusion coefficient . the drift term in equation ( [ n3.20 ] )",
    "refers to the presence of a dressed potential of the form    @xmath76    the modification of the potential is essentially due to nonlinear coupling of the system to the nonequilibrium modes .",

    "in absence of the external noise @xmath15 it reduces to the standard thermal boltzmann distribution , @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "thus the steady state distribution for the nonequilibrium open system plays the role of an equilibrium distribution of the closed system which may however be recovered in the absence of the external noise .",

    "based on a system reservoir microscopic model where the system is nonlinearly coupled to a heat bath which is modulated by an external , stationary gaussian noise with an arbitrary decaying correlation function , we have generalized the kramers theory and have numerically analyzed the model to calculate the steady state rate of escape from a metastable well .",
    "we have shown that since the reservoir is driven by the external noise and the dissipative properties of the system depend on the reservoir , a simple connection between the dissipation and the response function of the medium due to external noise can be established .",

    "the external agency generating noise does work on the bath by stirring , pumping , agitating etc to which the system dissipates internally . in the present treatment we are concerned with a nonequilibrium steady state that signifies a constant throughput of energy .",
