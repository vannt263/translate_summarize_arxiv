    "[ sec : intro ] onsager s evolution equations @xcite , based on the principle of detailed balance embedded in onsager s reciprocity relations , became a key tool for understanding the relaxational approach to equilibrium in a variety of physical processes .",
    "more recently , doi @xcite extended the range of this approach to processes in macroscopic soft matter systems , such as the swelling of gels and the dynamics of liquid crystals .",
    "it is less obvious that a similar approach can also be applied to processes out of equilibrium in spatially extended open systems .",
    "a well known example is the dynamics of single layer thin films in the long - wave ( or lubrication ) approximation @xcite where a single variable  the layer thickness  is sufficient for a description of the system . in this case , it is not a - priori obvious that an energy functional of thermodynamic origin exists for the system .",
    "nevertheless , as noticed by mitlin @xcite for dewetting films and by rosenau and oron for thin films heated from below @xcite , the dynamic equation for the layer thickness @xmath0 can be cast into a gradient dynamics form @xmath1 - q^{\\mathrm{nc}}\\left(\\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{f}}{\\delta h } -p_\\mathrm{vap}\\right ) , { \\label{eq : onefield : gov}}\\ ] ] showing that the evolution can be derived from a certain `` energy '' functional @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "@xmath3 is the pressure of the vapour phase that may instead be incorporated into @xmath4 . here and in the following @xmath5 denotes partial time derivatives and @xmath6 is the two - dimensional ( 2d ) spatial gradient operator .",
    "eq .   is the general form in which the dynamics has both a conserved and a non - conserved contributions with mobilities @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the usual procedure of irreversible thermodynamics is thereby reversed : first comes a dynamic equation obtained through a series of simplifications , and then a suitable functional is assigned , ensuring a dissipative evolution toward a minimum of this energy . however , in the case of dewetting the energy functional is the `` interface hamiltonian '' that is obtained via a systematic coarse - graining procedure from the microscale interaction energies @xcite .",
    "sometimes , even systems that are permanently out of equilibrium can be accommodated , as in the case of sliding droplets on an infinitely extended incline , where the correct thin film model can be brought into the form of a gradient dynamics with an underlying energy functional that includes potential energy @xcite .",
    "besides long - wave thin film equations , other examples of one - field gradient dynamics are the cahn - hilliard equation describing the demixing of a binary mixture , i.e. , a purely conserved dynamics ( @xmath9 ) @xcite and the allen - cahn equation that models , for instance , the purely non - conserved dynamics ( @xmath10 ) of the ising model in the mean field continuum limit @xcite . in general , equations of the form ( [ eq : onefield : gov ] ) are ubiquitous .",
    "they appear with various choices of @xmath4 , not only in the context of the dynamics of films of non - volatile and volatile liquids on solid substrates @xcite , but also as evolution equations for surface profiles in epitaxial growth @xcite , and , indeed , as models of one - component lipid bilayer adhesion dynamics @xcite .",
    "another field of application is in dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) , describing the dynamics of the density distribution of colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many hydrodynamic two- and more - field long - wave models were developed that describe , e.g. , the evolution of multilayer films , films of mixtures or surfactant - covered films @xcite .",
    "normally , they are not written in the gradient dynamics form .",
    "however , recently , the gradient dynamics approach was extended to several two - field models , namely , for the dewetting of two - layer films @xcite , for the coupled decomposition and dewetting of a film of a binary mixture @xcite and for the evolution of a layer of insoluble surfactant on a thin liquid film @xcite . in all these cases",
    ", energies with a clear physical meaning can be given that may also be obtained via the coarse - graining procedures of statistical physics .",
    "note though that the description of a thin two layer - film heated from below can not be brought into the onsager form @xcite , marking the single layer case as a fortuitous ` accident ' .",
    "nonetheless , certain out of equilibrium phenomena can be described via the addition of appropriate potential energies to the energy functional or , as in the case of dip coating and langmuir  blodgett transfer through `` comoving frame terms '' that account for a moving substrate that is withdrawn from a bath @xcite .",
    "similar two - field gradient dynamics models exist for the dynamics of membranes @xcite or as ddfts for mixtures @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the gradient dynamics approach to describe the non - equilibrium dissipative dynamics of thin film systems with several variables , and to cast the dynamic equations into a form that reproduces onsager s reciprocity relations .",
    "a further aim is to incorporate interphase exchange processes , such as evaporation and surfactant dissolution to derive equations combining conserved ( cahn  hilliard - type ) and non - conserved ( reaction - diffusion , or allen  cahn - type ) terms . in doing so ,",
    "several limitations of the known two - field models are alleviated .",
    "the particular example treated in detail is a thin liquid film that is covered by a soluble surfactant and rests on a solid substrate .",
    "the gradient dynamics model then describes the coupled evolution of the film height profile , the amount of surfactant within the film and the surface concentration dynamics ( three field ) model for the case of a thin liquid film covered by a soluble surfactant as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] .    , that varies with location on the surface @xmath11 and with time @xmath12 . on the liquid film free surface",
    "are surfactant molecules , with local density @xmath13 .",
    "the surfactant molecules have some solubility in the liquid and the local concentration within the body of the liquid is @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that @xmath15 does not vary vertically and only varies horizontally and with @xmath12 .",
    "this is equivalent to treating @xmath15 as a height - averaged concentration . over time",
    "there is exchange of surfactant molecules between the surface of the liquid and the bulk .",
    "there can also be condensation or evaporation of the liquid to vapour in the air above . ]",

    "[ sec : conc ] we have shown that a thin film ( or long - wave ) model for the dynamics of liquid films on solid substrates with a free liquid - gas interface that is covered by soluble surfactants can be brought into a gradient dynamics form . note that we always consider regimes where inertia does not enter ( small reynold number ) .",
    "the gradient dynamics form is fully consistent with linear non - equilibrium thermodynamics including onsager s reciprocity relations @xcite . in the dilute limit",

    "the free energy functional incorporates wetting energy ( resulting in a derjaguin or disjoining pressure ) , surface energy of the free interface ( constant contribution plus entropic term , resulting in capillarity - laplace pressure - and marangoni flux ) and bulk mixing free energy consisting solely of an ( ideal - gas ) entropic term that results in a dependence of evaporation on osmotic pressure but does not influence the convective flux",
    ". the entropic contributions also determine surfactant diffusion within and on the film and adsorption / desorption fluxes .",
    "the advantage of the gradient dynamics form is that one may amend the energy functional ( incorporating non - entropic mixing and surface energies , bulk and surface rigidities , concentration - dependent wetting energies , etc . ) and so one automatically obtains a thermodynamically consistent set of updated expressions for the laplace and derjaguin pressures , marangoni , korteweg and diffusion fluxes , and evaporation as well as adsorption / desorption terms .",
    "there are also new cross - coupling terms , e.g. , in the case of a concentration - dependent wettability .",
    "the general model we have presented contains as limits the case of films of non - surface active mixtures @xcite and insoluble surfactants @xcite . such models with specific energies are furthermore found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively . however , our work has also shown that many models existing in the literature are incomplete because they directly modify the hydrodynamic long - wave equations by incorporating , e.g. , concentration - dependent derjaguin pressures or nonlinear equations of state ( for examples see section  [ sec : surfsol - special ] , but also the discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "changes should be avoided as they alter only one ` transport channel ' ( e.g. marangoni flux or pressure gradient ) while the underlying change of the energy functional affects all transport channels .",
    "so does , e.g. , a change in the concentration - dependence of the surface free energy .",
    "this not only changes the surface equation of state and the marangoni flux , but also affects surfactant diffusion and adsorption / desorption . a concentration - dependent wettability results in a concentration - dependent derjaguin pressure and furthermore it gives a new marangoni - type flux , affects diffusion , evaporation , and adsorption / desorption .",
    "we expect that our general model with appropriately adapted energies can describe the film dynamics and incorporate the effects of , e.g. , the spreading of patches of high - concentration surfactants on a liquid layer , that exhibit a local concentration maximum at the advancing surfactant front @xcite , or the adsorption / desorption dynamics of nanoparticles that act as surfactant @xcite .    besides the amendments to the energy functional that we have discussed at length , an important element of a thermodynamically - consistent gradient dynamics structure are the mobilities that form a positive - definite ( positive entropy production ) and symmetric ( onsager s reciprocity relations ) matrix .",
    "whenever a similar model for a relaxational situation is derived by making a long - wave approximation , a transformation into the gradient dynamics form should result in such a mobility matrix - thereby providing a valuable check that not all models in the literature pass . here , we have not changed the convective mobilities , but allowed for general diffusive ones , @xmath187 and @xmath186 .",
    "a further discussion of the former [ @xmath187 ] is found in @xcite , where a solvent - solute symmetric model is developed ( without surface activity ) that is valid also for high solute concentrations .",
    "however , the convective mobilities may also be amended : for instance , one can incorporate slip at the substrate or solvent diffusion along the substrate as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for films of simple liquids and layers of organic molecules , respectively .",
    "less is known about the mobility coefficients of the non - conserved fluxes , so they are often approximated as a constant .",
    "a discussion of different mobility functions in the evaporation term is found , e.g. , in @xcite , although there also a constant is often used @xcite .",
    "the influence of the mobilities should be further studied  in the present three - field case we expect a larger influence than in the one - field case of a film of simple liquid . there",
    ", the various convective mobilities mainly change the relative timing of the different stages of the time evolution without much change to the pathway itself @xcite .",
    "another important factor that we have not discussed here , is the dependence of the liquid viscosity on solute concentration .",
    "this is easy to incorporate , as long as the liquid is newtonian .",
    "a further future task is the incorporation of surface viscosity @xcite that should results in changes to the mobility matrix .",
    "the gradient dynamics approach that we have presented may also be applied to situations where more than the three fields considered here ( effective bulk solute height , projected surface concentration , film height ) matter .",
    "for example , systems with surfactant adsorption at the solid substrate have relevance , e.g , for chemically - driven running droplets @xcite where the transfer of a surfactant between different media and a solid substrate plays an important role . to model",
    "such systems one needs to account for adsorption at the substrate and diffusion of the adsorbate along the substrate .",
    "this can be achieved through the incorporation of a fourth field ( adsorbate concentration ) into the gradient dynamics structure and an appropriate amendment of the energy functional .",
    "this leads to a fourth evolution equation that couples through additional adsorption / desorption fluxes with the dynamics of the other fields .",
    "such considerations are also important if one is seeking to model the dependence of the fluid dynamics in the contact line region on the concentration , including the concentration - dependence of all the involved interfacial tensions and of the equilibrium contact angle",
    ". such a model would allow one to describe the dynamics of effects like , e.g. , surfactant - induced autophobing @xcite .",
    "another important extension is the incorporation of micelle dynamics @xcite .",
    "this plays an important role , e.g. , for super - spreading , as does adsorption at the substrate @xcite . to do this",
    ", one must again incorporate additional fields into the gradient dynamics approach .",
    "one could employ the free energy approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and combine it with the present ideas to obtain coupled equations for the film height , effective solute height , effective micellar height and surface concentrations .",
    "this is straightforward if the micelles are monodisperse in size .",
    "however , the number of equations will proliferate if the number of molecules per micelle is considered in detail . in hydrodynamic long - wave models only one size",
    "is normally considered @xcite .",
    "since the adsorption at the substrate may be physisorption or chemisorption , the question arises whether , in general , chemical reactions may be incorporated into a gradient dynamics .",
    "@xcite provides such a formulation for reaction - diffusion systems that may be coupled to the present formulation of thin film hydrodynamics .",
    "preliminary considerations show that this is possible and results , e.g. , in cross - couplings between chemical reactions and wettability . however , as briefly discussed in section  [ sec : surfsol - nonconsfluxadsorp ] , what the correct way to construct the mobilities such that they agree with the ones obtained via kinetic considerations is still an open question .    throughout the present work we have nearly exclusively referred to relaxational situations ,",
    "i.e. , experimental settings without any imposed influxes or through - flows of energy or mass , where the initial state relaxes towards a minimum of the underlying energy functional .",
    "however , the resulting gradient dynamics formulation for the time evolution can now be supplemented by well - defined ( normally non - variational ) terms to describe systems that are permanently out of equilibrium .",
    "example of this are film flows and drop dynamics on inclined planes where a gradient dynamics model is obtained by incorporating the potential energy of the liquid into the energy functional @xcite .",
    "other examples include models for dip - coating and langmuir - blodgett transfer processes where a film of solution or suspension is transfered from a bath onto a moving plate @xcite .",
    "then the relaxational gradient dynamics is supplemented by a dragging or comoving frame term that together with lateral boundary conditions representing the bath and the deposited layer , respectively , effectively transforms the model into a non - relaxational out - of - equilibrium model that often shows multistability or self - organised pattern formation @xcite .",
    "it is similar for dragged films of simple liquids ( aka the landau - levich problem ) @xcite , films and drops on / in rotating cylinders @xcite and also for evaporative dewetting of suspensions ( in the comoving frame of a planar evaporation front ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one may impose certain in- and/or out - fluxes of material that break the gradient dynamics structure ( e.g. , caused by heating ) @xcite .    finally , we point out that such an approach to interface - dominated out - of - equilibrium processes may also be applied to the modelling of ( bio-)active soft matter .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite presents a model for the osmotic spreading dynamics of bacterial biofilms where a relaxational model for a mixture of aqueous solvent and biomass is supplemented by growth terms that model the proliferation of biomass .",
    "another example considers a dilute carpet of insoluble self - propelled micro - swimmers on a liquid film and describes it using an extension of models developed for insoluble non - self - propelling surfactant particles @xcite . to describe higher concentrations of the micro - swimmers one could employ the present model of soluble surfactants and add contributions resulting from the self - propulsion .",

    "<S> in this paper we propose equations of motion for the dynamics of liquid films of surfactant suspensions that consist of a general gradient dynamics framework based on an underlying energy functional . </S>",
    "<S> this extends the gradient dynamics approach to dissipative non - equilibrium thin film systems with several variables , and casts their dynamic equations into a form that reproduces onsager s reciprocity relations . </S>",
    "<S> we first discuss the general form of gradient dynamics models for an arbitrary number of fields and discuss simple well - known examples with one or two fields . </S>",
    "<S> next , we develop the gradient dynamics ( three field ) model for a thin liquid film covered by soluble surfactant and discuss how it automatically results in consistent convective ( driven by pressure gradients , marangoni forces and korteweg stresses ) , diffusive , adsorption / desorption , and evaporation fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that in the dilute limit , the model reduces to the well - known hydrodynamic form that includes marangoni fluxes due to a linear equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> in this case the energy functional incorporates wetting energy , surface energy of the free interface ( constant contribution plus an entropic term ) and bulk mixing entropy . subsequently , as an example , we show how various extensions of the energy functional result in consistent dynamical models that account for nonlinear equations of state , concentration - dependent wettability and surfactant and film bulk decomposition phase transitions . we conclude with a discussion of further possible extensions towards systems with micelles , surfactant adsorption at the solid substrate and bioactive behaviour . </S>"
