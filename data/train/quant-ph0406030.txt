    "the twin - beam state ( twb ) of two modes of radiation can be expressed in the photon number basis as @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the twb squeezing parameter .",

    "since ( [ twb : wig ] ) is positive - definite , twb are not suitable to test nonlocality through homodyne detection .",
    "indeed , the wigner function itself provides an explicit hidden variable model for homodyne measurements @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown @xcite that twb exhibits a nonlocal character for parity measurements .",
    "this is known as nonlocality in the phase - space since bell inequalities can be written in terms of the wigner function , which in turn describes correlations for the joint measurement of displaced parity operators .",
    "overall , the positivity or the negativity of the wigner function has a rather weak relation to the locality or the nonlocality of quantum correlations .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have suggested a conditional measurement scheme on twb leading to a non gaussian entangled mixed state , which improves fidelity in the teleportation of coherent states .",
    "this process , called inconclusive photon subtraction ( ips ) , is based on mixing each mode of the twb with the vacuum in a unbalanced beam splitter and then performing inconclusive photodetection on both modes , _ i.e. _ revealing the reflected beams without discriminating the number of the detected photons .    a single mode version of the ips , mapping squeezed light onto non - gaussian states , has been recently realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "moreover , ips has been suggested as a feasible method to modify twb and test nonlocality using homodyne detection @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address ips as a _",
    "degaussification _ map for twb , give its explicit expression for the density matrix and the wigner function , and investigate the nonlocality of the resulting state in the phase - space .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ s : bana ]",
    "we review nonlocality in the phase - space , _ i.e. _ wigner function bell s inequality based on measuring the displaced parity operator on two modes of radiation . in section [ s : degauss ] we illustrate the ips process as a degaussification map and calculate the wigner function of the ips state .",
    "the nonlocality of the ips state in the phase - space is then analyzed in section [ s : nonlocal ] , whereas in section [ s : homodyne ] we discuss nonlocality using homodyne detection , extending the analysis of ref .",

    "since the two - mode wigner function @xmath12 can be expressed as @xmath13 @xmath14 being the expectation value of @xmath15 , the violation of these inequalities is also known as nonlocality in the phase - space . the quantity involved in such inequalities",
