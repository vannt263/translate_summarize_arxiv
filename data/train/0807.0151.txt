    "a clear understanding of the composition features of the uhecr spectrum passes through a detailed study of the propagation of uhe protons and nuclei in astrophysical backgrounds . in particular ,",
    "uhe nuclei interacting with such backgrounds suffer two main process : ( i ) photo - disintegration , giving rise to the production of secondary nucleons ( hereafter protons ) and lighter nuclei , ( ii ) pair production , that produces a depletion in the nucleus energy .",
    "the study of the photo - disintegration process of uhe nuclei has already attracted the attention of several authors that have studied the propagation of these particles with the aim of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ( for a detailed list of references see also @xcite ) .",
    "one of the pioneering works in this field was performed in @xcite , where the authors introduced , for the first time , a very useful parameterization of the photo - disintegration cross - section , this result was up - dated in @xcite .",
    "recently , a more detailed parameterization of the photo - disintegration cross - section was presented in @xcite , this computation confirms the findings of @xcite and @xcite at energies below @xmath0 ev , showing some deviations at the extreme energies .",
    "the studies performed so far have shown the important role that the infrared / optical background ( irb ) plays in nuclei propagation , this is an important result that , on the other hand , complicates the understanding because of the less precise determination of such background respect to the well known cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .    in this paper we will briefly present a new analytical computation scheme that , based on a kinetic approach in the approximation of continuos energy losses , enables the computation of uhe nuclei propagation in any background , with the determination of the expected fluxes on earth of the primary injected particles as well as of all secondaries ( nuclei and nucleons ) produced in the photo - disintegration process . following @xcite , in order to explain the method proposed , we will restrict the discussion to the case of the cmb radiation alone .",
    "nuclei propagating in the intergalactic medium suffer a degradation of the lorentz factor and are photo - disintegrated with a change in the propagating nuclei specie . in particular , the universe expansion and the process of pair production on astrophysical backgrounds are responsible for the lorentz factor depletion , with the conservation of the nuclei species ( i.e. atomic mass number a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction of nuclei with astrophysical backgrounds is also responsible for the photo - disintegration of nuclei , this process changes the nuclei species conserving the nucleus lorentz factor .",
    "the process of pair production is efficient only on the cmb background field , while the photo - disintegration process depends also on the irb . as discussed in @xcite , once determined the energy losses , namely the two quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we can compute the survival history of nuclei during their journey from the source to the observer . specifying the initial conditions at red - shift @xmath3 , namely the observed nuclei specie ( @xmath4 ) at the observed energy @xmath5 , solving the evolution equations @xmath6 we can trace the nucleus back to the source where it was injected as @xmath7 with the generation energy @xmath8 ( being @xmath9 the proton mass ) .",
    "we consider an expanding universe homogeneously filled by the sources of the accelerated primary nuclei of a single fixed specie @xmath7 , with a generation rate per unit of co - moving volume given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the generation index and @xmath12 is the source emissivity ( i.e. the generated energy per unit of co - moving volume and per unit time ) at @xmath3 . the co - moving space density of nuclei @xmath13 of a fixed specie @xmath14 ( primary @xmath15 or secondary @xmath16 ) can be determined as the solution of the kinetic equation given by @xmath17 + \\frac{n_a(\\gamma_a , t)}{\\tau_a(\\gamma_a , t ) } = q_a(\\gamma_a , t ) , \\label{eq : kin}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the rate of the lorentz - factor loss , @xmath19 is the injection of nuclei ( primaries @xmath15 or secondaries @xmath16 ) .",
    "the photo - disintegration process in ( [ eq : kin ] ) is interpreted as a decaying process that simply depletes the flux of nuclei with an associated nucleus `` lifetime '' given by @xmath20 . as discussed in @xcite the solution of the kinetic equation at red - shif zero @xmath21",

    "as discussed in @xcite , the explicit expression of @xmath19 is determined imposing the conservation of the number of particles along the evolution trajectory of the nucleus @xmath14 ( with @xmath27 at @xmath3 ) and assuming that @xmath14 is always produced by the photo - disintegration process suffered by its father @xmath30 . under these assumptions",
    "one has : @xmath31 only inside the interval @xmath32 , as given in @xcite , with @xmath33 , being @xmath24 the red - shift of @xmath14 production , @xmath34 the red - shift of the injected primary @xmath7 and @xmath35 as in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we take into account the cmb radiation field alone , under this assumption the flux of secondary protons can be fairly computed assuming an instantaneous photo - disintegration of the primary nucleus @xmath7 @xcite , giving rise to an instantaneous production of @xmath7 nucleons . once determined the injection of protons @xmath36 their flux is simply determined as in @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig ] , assuming @xmath37 , we show the flux of primary iron , secondary protons and secondary helium in the case of @xmath38 with a maximum energy of acceleration @xmath39 ev .",
