    "the origin of baryon asymmetry is one of the most profound puzzles in modern cosmology and particle physics .",
    "it is well - known that baryon accounts for about 5% of the total energy density of the universe  @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number density of baryon , and @xmath3 is the entropy density .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics and standard cosmology , however , do not provide any viable mechanism to generate the observed baryon number . to be specific , three conditions known as the sakharov conditions  @xcite have to be satisfied for successful baryogenesis : ( i ) baryon number violation , ( ii ) c and cp violation , and ( iii ) departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "these conditions require physics beyond the sm and set tight constraints on possible scenarios for baryogenesis .    the mechanism for baryogenesis is closely related to the thermal history of the universe .",
    "the recent observations of cosmic microwave background as well as large scale structure of the universe firmly support the inflationary universe in which our universe experienced an accelerating cosmic expansion at an early stage of the evolution  @xcite .",
    "thus baryon asymmetry must be generated after inflation since otherwise the exponential expansion during inflation would completely dilute any pre - existing baryon asymmetry .",
    "however , the history of the universe after inflation is poorly known .",
    "the inflaton may directly decay into the sm particles to reheat the universe .",
    "the right amount of baryon asymmetry can be generated through thermal leptogenesis if the reheating temperature is sufficiently high  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the evolution of the universe could be more involved .",
    "indeed , there are many moduli fields in supergravity and superstring theories , which may have a significant effect on the thermal history .",
    "they are known to easily dominate the energy density of the universe because the moduli fields are copiously produced by the coherent oscillation and that their interactions are extremely weak , suppressed by the planck scale or grand unified theory ( gut ) scale .",
    "then a huge amount of entropy is released by the moduli decay , diluting pre - existing baryon asymmetry . as a consequence we have two possibilities for baryogenesis",
    "one is to create a sufficiently large amount of baryon asymmetry before the moduli decay by , _",
    "e.g. _ , the affleck - dine mechanism  @xcite , which has been extensively studied in a context of modular cosmology  @xcite . the other is to generate baryon asymmetry after the moduli decay .",
    "this is the main focus of the present paper .",
    "we assume that moduli fields dominate the energy density of the universe in the framework of supergravity .",
    "after dominating the universe , moduli decay to lighter particles in the minimal extension of supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . the moduli decay temperature can be higher than @xmath0  mev for the moduli mass heavier than about @xmath4  tev if their interactions are suppressed by the planck mass , thus avoiding bounds from the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn )  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study a baryogenesis scenario in which the baryon asymmetry is generated through cp violating decay of gluino into quark and squark , followed by baryon - number violating squark decay",
    ". we will introduce renormalizable r - parity violating interactions to get the required baryon number violation .",
    "late - time moduli decay can easily realize the out - of - equilibrium decays of gluino and squark . on the other hand ,",
    "the size of the cp phase depends on how supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking is transmitted to the visible sector . as we will see shortly ,",
    "the required cp violation for the baryogenesis has important implications for moduli stabilization .",
    "successful baryogenesis is possible in moduli stabilization such that moduli - mediated susy breaking is sizable , and the axionic shift symmetry associated with the modulus is broken at least by two terms in the modulus superpotential .",
    "we will focus on mixed modulus - anomaly mediation in the kachru - kallosh - linde - trivedi ( kklt)-type moduli stabilization  @xcite , as it provides a natural framework for the moduli - induced baryogenesis .",
    "we will also show that similar baryogenesis works in other cases where the gravitino , the saxion , or the polonyi field dominates the universe , and decays mainly into the sm gauge sector .",
    "let us mention differences of the present paper from the works in the past .",
    "baryogenesis induced by a modulus - like particle has been studied since long time ago .",
    "the gravitino - induced baryogenesis was proposed by cline and raby  @xcite , followed by mollerach and roulet who studied a similar scenario where the saxion plays the role of the gravitino  @xcite .",
    "recently baryogenesis via such late - decaying particles was studied in a generic way by with higher dimension operators  @xcite . in those studies",
    "the origin of the cp phase was simply assumed to be independent of the decaying particle . in the present paper",
    "we study a baryogenesis within a concrete moduli stabilization mechanism , where the modulus field mediates susy breaking with a non - vanishing cp phase , and its decay provides out - of - equilibrium decays of gluino and squark .",
    "therefore the moduli - induced baryogenesis studied in this paper offers a realistic and self - contained scenario . later in this paper",
    "we will revisit the gravitino - induced baryogenesis .",
    "here we will provide analytic formulae which can be applied to a more generic mass spectrum of superparticles .",
    "note that it was shown that the inflaton  @xcite as well as moduli  @xcite generically decays into a pair of gravitinos .",
    "therefore the gravitino - dominated universe can be realized in a broader scenario than originally assumed .",
    "its cosmological and phenomenological implications have been studied recently in ref .",
    "we will also revisit the saxion - induced baryogenesis . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was indicated that the saxion decay to gauginos is helicity - suppressed . as clearly shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , it is not helicity - suppressed and its rate is generically comparable to that into gauge bosons . taking into account this fact , we will show that the saxion - induced baryogenesis is more efficient than originally considered before .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we study mixed modulus - anomaly mediation in the kklt - type moduli stabilization , focusing on how to obtain the cp violation required for successful baryogenesis",
    ". we will then examine the baryogenesis by modulus decay in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , and study the implications for the susy breaking scale and discuss its experimental consequences . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we discuss similar baryogenesis by the decay of the gravitino and the saxion .",
    "[ sec:5 ] is devoted to conclusions and discussion . in this paper",
    "we take the reduced planck mass @xmath5 to be unity unless otherwise noted .",
    "we consider the possibility that late - decaying moduli account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe . to produce baryon asymmetry , we need couplings that violate both baryon number and cp .",
    "baryon number violation arises from r - parity violating interactions while satisfying various experimental constraints , such as neutron - antineutron oscillation , dinucleon decay , and proton decay . the required cp violation , on the other hand ,",
    "can be induced after susy breaking from the r - parity violating interactions . however , generating a nonzero cp phase is nontrivial .",
    "it depends on the susy breaking mechanism and the moduli stabilization .    as is well - known , anomaly mediation  @xcite ( and also gauge mediation ) generates flavor and cp conserving soft susy breaking terms because it takes place mainly through the sm gauge interactions .",
    "the soft terms induced by moduli @xmath6-terms are also considered to preserve both flavor and cp . here",
    "the flavor conservation is a result of flavor - universal rational numbers called the modular weight , which determines the coupling between moduli and the matter fields in visible sector  @xcite , meanwhile cp conserving soft terms are the consequence of axionic shift symmetries associated with the moduli @xcite .",
    "however , this is true only for a simple kklt - type moduli stabilization .",
    "it turns out that a sizable cp violation can be obtained from the moduli sector if    * soft susy breaking terms receive sizable contributions from the moduli @xmath6-terms , and * non - perturbative corrections , which generate a modulus potential and break the axionic shift symmetry , involve at least two terms .",
    "we will see that the kklt scenario is a natural framework for the moduli - induced baryogenesis that works at low temperatures .",
    "it will be also shown in the next section that such a sizable cp violation for baryogenesis could have interesting experimental consequences .      in the kklt compactification @xcite , all the moduli",
    "are stabilized at a phenomenologically viable vacuum .",
    "there are three types of moduli ; dilaton , complex structure moduli , and khler moduli .",
    "the dilation and complex structure moduli are fixed by fluxes while obtaining masses hierarchically larger than the gravitino mass .",
    "incorporating non - perturbative corrections to the superpotential , one can also stabilize khler moduli at a supersymmetric anti - de sitter ( ads ) minimum . since our vacuum is a susy breaking de sitter with a tiny cosmological constant ,",
    "we introduce an anti - brane stabilized at the tip of a highly warped throat",
    ". then its tension provides a small positive energy to cancel the negative cosmological constant . at the same time it explicitly breaks the @xmath7 susy preserved by the background geometry and fluxes . to be precise ,",
    "a small vacuum shift is induced and makes the moduli develop nonzero @xmath6-terms . through planck - suppressed interactions with the moduli",
    ", sparticles then obtain the soft susy breaking masses as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the gravitino mass . hence",
    ", if stabilized with mass much larger than @xmath10 , the modulus does not play an important role in generating the soft susy breaking terms because they always receive anomaly - mediated susy breaking contribution , @xmath11 , in supergravity @xcite .",
    "the stabilization of khler moduli can be examined within the effective theory after integrating out the dilation and complex structure moduli as they are much heavier than the gravitino and khler moduli  @xcite .",
    "let us consider a simple case with a single khler modulus @xmath12 .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize to a case with multi khler moduli .",
    "the khler potential takes the no - scale form at the leading order in the @xmath13 ( the string tension ) and the string loop expansions , @xmath14 it should be noticed that the theory possesses the axionic shift symmetry , @xmath15 this shift symmetry can be explicitly broken at non - perturbative level .",
    "for example , hidden gaugino condensation or stringy instanton effects induce non - perturbative terms in superpotential . including the non - perturbative corrections , the modulus superpotential is given by @xmath16 where the constant term @xmath17 is originated from background fluxes , which is assumed to be much smaller than order unity in the planck unit so as to get the soft susy breaking scale much lower than the planck scale .",
    "we also note that the constant term explicitly breaks u@xmath18 .",
    "the above superpotential stabilizes the modulus at a susy ads minimum satisfying @xmath19 here @xmath20 means a partial derivative with respect to the scalar field @xmath12 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath21",
    ". then the modulus mass is determined by the curvature around the minimum as @xmath22 where the gravitino mass is given by @xmath23 , and we have used @xmath24 and the susy condition ( [ susy - condition ] ) . after adding a sequestered uplifting potential @xmath25 to cancel the negative cosmological constant , a small vacuum shift is induced .",
    "this vacuum shift results in a nonzero modulus @xmath6-term , @xmath26 which is order of @xmath27 .",
    "let us continue to examine how the susy breaking is mediated to the visible sector .",
    "the soft susy breaking terms receive contributions from both modulus mediation and anomaly mediation @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the scalar component of the visible sector chiral superfield @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the gaugino , and @xmath32 is the yukawa coupling for the superpotential term @xmath33 .",
    "here @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the indices of matter fields , and @xmath37 corresponds to the u(1)@xmath38 , su(2)@xmath39 , su(3)@xmath40 gauge group , respectively .",
    "the mass of gaugino is obtained as @xmath41 when the gauge kinetic function is @xmath42 at the cut - off scale @xmath43 , which we assume to be the gut scale .",
    "@xmath44 is a positive constant .",
    "here we note that the gauge kinetic function is allowed to have only a term which is linear to @xmath12 ( except for constant term ) due to the axionic shift symmetry , _ i.e. _ , eq .  ( [ eq : pert_shift_sym ] ) .",
    "the gauge coupling reads @xmath45 , and the beta - function coefficients are given by @xmath46 in the mssm .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath47 and @xmath48 depend on the anomalous dimension @xmath49 and the modular weight @xmath50 of @xmath29  @xcite that determines the modulus dependence of the matter wave function @xmath51 .",
    "for instance , the @xmath52-parameter reads @xmath53 where @xmath50 is a rational number of order unity , and it can have various values in the kklt - type moduli stabilization with anomalous u(1 ) gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "low energy values of the soft susy breaking parameters are determined by the renormalization group running , and extra gauge - charged matters if they exist at an intermediate scale @xcite .      as will be shown in the next section , in order to generate sufficient baryon asymmetry from modulus decays ,",
    "the phase of the combination @xmath54 should be sizable , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the gluino mass , and hereafter @xmath48 denotes the soft trilinear parameter associated with baryon - number violating superpotential terms , which will be presented soon .    in the kklt scenario , moduli and anomaly mediations are comparable to each other , and the relative phase between the modulus @xmath6-term and the gravitino mass is not rotated away in the presence of two or more non - perturbative superpotential terms .",
    "this indeed makes it as a natural framework to implement the baryogenesis in the modulus - dominated universe . from the relations ( [ gaugino - mass ] ) and ( [ a - parameter ] ) ,",
    "the phase is naively estimated to be @xmath57 omitting an order unity coefficient which depends on the renormalization group running and extra gauge - charged matter fields .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 represents the ratio between moduli and anomaly mediations , @xmath59 where we have used that the modulus @xmath6-term is given by eq .",
    "( [ f - term ] ) .",
    "the original kklt scenario gives @xmath60 .",
    "it is obvious that the phase is suppressed if one of the mediation mechanisms dominates over the other . on the other hand , the approximate symmetry , u@xmath18 and",
    "u@xmath61 , indicates that @xmath62 should include at least two non - perturbative terms to get nonzero @xmath63 .",
    "this is understood as follows .",
    "suppose that there is only a single non - perturbative term .",
    "one can then remove the cp phases in the superpotential by redefining @xmath17 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , it is not generically possible to rotate away the cp phase(s ) of additional non - perturbative term(s ) . that is why at least two non - perturbative terms are needed to get a cp phase .",
    "now let us estimate the cp phase more quantitatively .",
    "for this purpose , we consider the superpotential , @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath52 and @xmath67 are order unity complex constants . here",
    "the approximate u@xmath18 and u@xmath61 ( explicitly broken by the constant and non - perturbative terms ) allow us to make @xmath17 and @xmath52 be real and positive numbers without loss of generality , which is the convention we will take hereafter .",
    "this explains why @xmath12 is fixed at a cp - conserving minimum with mass @xmath68 in the absence of the last term in eq .",
    "( [ w - model ] ) , as was considered in the original kklt mechanism .",
    "here we have used @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "let us now turn on the @xmath71 term with @xmath72 . then the susy condition reads @xmath73 neglecting small terms suppressed by @xmath74 or @xmath75 . since the right - hand side is a real number , @xmath72 shifts the minimum to a cp - violating one , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath76 . using the facts that the modulus @xmath6-term is generated according to the relation ( [ f - term ] ) after uplifting , and that the modulus is fixed at @xmath77",

    "furthermore , the modulus becomes much heavier than @xmath83 , thereby suppressing the modulus mediation .",
    "see the relation ( [ cp - violation - for - baryogenesis ] ) .",
    "] under the assumption that @xmath84 , the vacuum shift induced by @xmath85 leads to @xmath86 for @xmath87 similar to but larger than @xmath88 .",
    "here @xmath89 is a rational number if the non - perturbative terms arise from hidden gaugino condensation .",
    "for instance , the phase is around @xmath90@xmath91 @xmath92@xmath93 in the model with @xmath94 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "let us close this section by briefly mentioning the susy breaking scale .",
    "we are interested in the case where the cp violation in the moduli sector gives rise to a sizable @xmath97 to implement the baryogenesis .",
    "thus , to avoid the susy cp problems , the mssm sparticles should be heavier than 1  tev unless there is a cancellation among sparticle contributions in the amplitudes of physical processes .",
    "we will quantitatively discuss the constraint on the cp phase later .",
    "heavy sparticles around over tev scale may indicate a little hierarchy problem regarding the higgs boson mass .",
    "however , to put it another way , such a large sparticle ( mainly stop ) mass is one of possible explanations for the 126  gev higgs boson discovered at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "in this section we will discuss the generation of baryon asymmetry by modulus decay . during inflation",
    "the modulus is likely deviated from the true vacuum in the low energy , due to the deformation of the potential through gravitational interactions with the inflaton .",
    "after inflation ends , it starts coherent oscillation when the hubble parameter becomes comparable to @xmath98 with a large initial displacement of the order of the planck scale , and then soon dominates the energy density of the universe .",
    "eventually the modulus field decays to lighter particles .",
    "the modulus decay releases a huge amount of entropy , which would dilute any ( harmful ) relic of the early universe , and reheats the universe at the temperature @xmath99 given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the relativistic degrees of freedom , and @xmath102 is the total decay width of the modulus field . although the late modulus decay might washout pre - existing baryon asymmetry as well",
    ", we will show that sufficient baryon asymmetry is generated by the modulus decay followed by the gluino decay if the r - parity is violated . here",
    "we will also discuss the experimental consequences of this baryogenesis scenario .",
    "the modulus decays into the mssm particles through its couplings to the visible sector . for the case",

    "@xmath106 is the field strength of gauge field , and the modulus couplings are given by @xmath107 where the modulus coupling to gauginos has been derived by using the relation @xmath108 evaluated at the vacuum .",

    "i.e. _ , for the sakharov condition ( ii ) , for the baryogenesis via subsequent gluino and squark decays .",
    "it is also important that the branching fraction into a gluino pair is given by @xmath114 thus gluinos , whose decay is the source of the baryon asymmetry , are abundantly produced by modulus decay .    for the baryogenesis we introduce the baryon - number violating renormalizable operators in addition to the mssm superpotential @xmath115 ; @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the su(2)@xmath39 singlet up - type and down - type quarks , respectively , and @xmath119 are flavor indices while color indices are implicit .",

    "therefore , the asymmetry generated by modulus ( and subsequent sparticle ) decays is not diluted .",
    "it is also important to note that the moduli - induced gravitino problem @xcite is avoided in the presence of r - parity violating operators because the lightest sparticle is not stable anymore .",

    "( [ eq : trvalue ] ) .",
    "now let us suppose that the gravitino decays to all mssm particles . then taking the large gravitino mass limit ,",
    "the total decay width is given by @xmath238 where @xmath239 is the number of chiral superfields ( neglecting right - handed neutrinos ) and @xmath240 is the number of gauginos in the mssm .",

    "the branching ratio of the decay to gluino and gluon , under the assumption above , is then @xmath242 this large branching fraction is important for the baryogenesis .",

    "note that this decay mode has the asymmetry between its cp conjugate and itself , which is given by a similar diagram depicted in fig .",

    "@xcite . in their work",
    ", they took the maximum value for cp phase which is allowed by constraints from neutron edm experiment at that time .",

    ", we get @xmath265 this is almost consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite up to @xmath266 factor .",
    "the peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism is a plausible solution to the strong cp problem , and it predicts a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson , the axion  @xcite , which acquires a small mass predominantly from the qcd anomaly . the axion is stable on cosmological time scale ,",
    "thus it is a good candidate for dark matter . in the supersymmetric extension of the pq mechanism , its scalar partner ,",
    "called saxion , remains relatively light as it acquires a mass only from the susy breaking effects .",
    "in fact , it is known that the saxion tends to dominate the energy density of the early universe , and it plays a similar role as the modulus .",
    "the advantages of using the saxion as a source of the baryogenesis are two folds .",
    "first , it necessarily couples to the qcd gauge sector in order to solve the strong cp problem , and therefore naturally decays into gluons and gluinos .",
    "secondly , the baryogenesis can be more efficient because the decay temperature will be relatively high for the axion decay constant @xmath267 is smaller than the gut scale .",
    "let us assume that the coherent oscillation of the saxion dominates the energy density of the universe .",
    "the amount of baryon asymmetry generated by the saxion decay depends on the reheating temperature @xmath268 at the saxion decay as well as the branching fraction for the saxion decay into a gluino pair .",
    "in particular , the latter depends on the saxion coupling to axion , @xmath269 where @xmath3 and @xmath88 are the saxion and axion , respectively , and @xmath270 is a model - dependent numerical coefficient . in order to have a sizable branching fraction into gluino pair , and also to avoid the overproduction of axionic dark radiation , @xmath270 must be highly suppressed below unity since the saxion coupling to the qcd gauge sector is one - loop suppressed for a given axion decay constant @xmath267 .",
    "as the precise value of @xmath270 depends on how the pq scalars are stabilized , let us see the axion models in some detail .",
    "the axion models can be categorized according to whether the pq symmetry is realized linearly or non - linearly . for the former case , which is sometimes dubbed a field - theoretic axion model , the axion decay constant @xmath267 ranges from an intermediate scale up to the gut scale .",
    "the saxion coupling with axion depends on the stabilization mechanism . in a model with a single pq scalar ,",
    "@xmath270 is of order unity .",
    "one way to suppress @xmath270 is to consider a model with two pq scalars @xmath271 and @xmath272 , which have an opposite pq charge each other , and a u(1)@xmath273 singlet @xmath274 , @xmath275 so that the pq symmetry is broken along the @xmath6-flat direction @xmath276 , which is lifted by susy breaking effects . in this model , the axion decay constant is given by @xmath277 . if @xmath271 and @xmath272 obtain the soft scalar masses of a similar size , then @xmath270 is suppressed as @xmath278 , where @xmath279 is the typical size of their soft masses and @xmath280 is the mass splitting between them  @xcite .    the latter case , which is called a string axion model , on the other hand , corresponds to the case where the axionic shift symmetry of some moduli remains unbroken ( except for the qcd anomaly ) .",
    "the axion decay constant is then typically around @xmath281 unless the khler metric of the saxion is hierarchically smaller than unity at the vacuum .",
    "thus , in this case , one needs to assume a small initial misalignment of the axion in order for the axion relic energy density not to overclose the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "the saxion coupling to axion is typically suppressed as @xmath282 , and thus the branching fraction of the saxion decay into gluino pair is naturally sizable and is comparable to that into the axions  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the coupling to the qcd gauge sector arises at tree level in this case .",
    "we note that the kklt mechanism provides a natural framework to implement the saxion - induced baryogenesis both for the field - theoretic and the string axion models .",
    "first , the cp phase is obtained in the same way as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .",
    "note that the @xmath6-term in the axion multiplet does not induce a new cp phase in the mssm soft terms because the soft terms generating a saxion potential depend on the moduli @xmath6-terms and the gravitino mass .",
    "besides , the suppression for @xmath270 can be also implemented in both models with the kklt scenario . for the axion model described in eq .",
    "( [ axion - model ] ) , let us assume that the yukawa couplings of @xmath271 and @xmath272 are small , and the pq scalars @xmath271 and @xmath272 have the same modulus dependence , _ i.e. _ , the same modular weight . since the symmetry under interchanging between @xmath271 and @xmath272 is a good symmetry , then one can naturally achieve @xmath283 , suppressing the saxion coupling to the axion . on the other hand , in the string axion model , the qcd axion can arise from a khler modulus in the kklt scenario with multiple khler moduli , if the axionic shift symmetry for the khler modulus is not broken explicitly .",
    "this modulus is stabilized with a mass of about @xmath284 through khler mixing with other moduli , which are stabilized by the non - perturbative superpotential as in the original kklt .    in either field - theoretic axion model or string axion model ,",
    "the modulus @xmath12 may dominate the universe before the saxion - dominated universe .",
    "this is because the saxion is much lighter than the modulus .",
    "although the modulus decay generates the baryon asymmetry as we have described , the asymmetry is washed out by the saxion decay later . however , the saxion decay can generate baryon asymmetry .",
    "now let us estimate the baryon asymmetry produced by the saxion . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case where the axion production from the saxion decays is negligible , and the saxion dominantly decays to a gluon pair and a gluino pair .",
    "including the decay into the axions does not affect our results as long as @xmath285 .",
    "the saxion couplings to gluon and gluino are given ( in two - component notation ) by @xmath286 where @xmath287 is the gluon field strength and @xmath288 is the saxion mass , and the order unity constant @xmath289 is determined by how the saxion is stabilized .",
    "the above couplings mediate the saxion decay into a gluon pair and a gluino pair with @xmath290 \\left[|\\kappa|^2\\left(1-\\frac{m_{\\tilde{g}}^2}{2m_s^2}\\right ) -2{\\rm re}(\\kappa^2)\\frac{m_{\\tilde{g}}^2}{m_s^2}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the total decay rate of the saxion is given as @xmath291 neglecting the gluino mass in the final state .",
    "consequently the branching ratio for the process @xmath292 is obtained as @xmath293 on the contrary , @xmath294 was given in ref .",
    "this result indicates a chiral suppression due to the gluino mass since @xmath295 when @xmath296 .",
    "as it is seen , however , there is no such chiral suppression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : br_saxion_gluino ] ) , which is already pointed out by ref .  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath297 is order unity , the saxion can dominantly decay into a gluino pair .",
    "this makes the baryogenesis by the saxion decay more efficient than originally considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "after the gluino production , the same story follows as in the modulus case . in the string axion models ,",
    "the reheating temperature is similar to the modulus case , while it can be higher in field - theoretic axion models if the axion decay constant is smaller than the gut scale .",
    "the reheating temperature is given by @xmath298 where we have taken @xmath299 .",
    "the resultant asymmetric yield is estimated by @xmath300 thus the right amount of baryon asymmetry can be generated for the saxion mass around @xmath301 .",
    "on top of that , as mentioned above , the axion produced by the misalignment mechanism contributes to the cold dark matter .",
    "this fact is especially important because the lightest sparticle is no longer stable due to the r - parity violation .",
    "in this paper we have studied a baryogenesis induced by late - decaying moduli , and examined its implications for the moduli stabilization and the susy breaking scale .",
    "if the branching fraction of the modulus into a gluino pair is sizable , the right amount of baryon asymmetry can be generated through cp violating decay of gluino into quark and squark followed by baryon - number violating squark decays .",
    "we have shown that a natural framework realizing the baryogenesis is provided by the kklt - type moduli stabilization since sufficient cp violation is obtained from mixed modulus - anomaly mediated susy breaking in the presence of two or more non - perturbative terms in the modulus superpotential .",
    "successful baryogenesis is possible for the gravitino mass around @xmath206@xmath207  gev or equivalently the soft susy breaking mass @xmath302@xmath206  gev ( or heavier for a suppressed cp phase or effective cp violation parameter ) .",
    "such low susy breaking scale can be probed directly at the collider experiments , dinucleon decay search , and electric dipole moments of neutron and electron .",
    "we also found that similar baryogenesis works successfully in other scenarios where the saxion or the gravitino dominates the universe .",
    "lastly let us discuss baryogenesis in a couple of other moduli stabilization and susy breaking scenarios .",
    "we have mainly focused on the mixed modulus - anomaly mediation so far , assuming a sequestered uplifting .",
    "if the uplifting is not sequestered , sfermion masses are generically heavier than gaugino masses , then the gluino decay into quark and squark will be kinematically forbidden . even in such case , however , the gravitino produced by the modulus decay will be able to generate baryon asymmetry .",
    "the large volume scenario  @xcite can also lead to cp violating soft terms if one takes the same form of the superpotential for a small 4-cycle modulus as in .",
    "however , one can not simply apply the moduli - induced baryogenesis discussed in the present paper to the large volume scenario because the overall volume modulus , which has a small mass compared to other moduli , does not appear in the visible gauge kinetic function and thus weakly couples to gluino .",
    "in addition , the modulus decay into a pair of gravitinos is kinematically forbidden and the decay into higgsinos is suppressed due to the approximate no - scale structure even in the presence of the giudice - masiero term  @xcite .",
    "those fact indicate much smaller amount of gluino produced by modulus decay , which suppress the resultant baryon number .",
    "regarding the moduli stabilization , we note that there is a general tension between moduli stabilization by non - perturbative effects and chirality  @xcite . to be specific , ( a combination of ) the moduli @xmath303 appearing in the gauge kinetic function of the visible gauge sector may not be stabilized by instantonic exponential terms .",
    "the saxion in the string axion model corresponds to this case , and as discussed before , it can be stabilized by another way  @xcite and the saxion - induced baryogenesis works .",
    "alternatively , we may consider a modulus field which is stabilized _ a la _ kklt , while not appearing in the sm gauge kinetic function .",
    "such modulus field can still decay into gauge bosons and gauginos through the kinetic mixing with @xmath303 .",
    "thus the baryon asymmetry will be generated by the subsequent gluino decay , although it may be diluted by the decay of lighter moduli @xmath303 to some extent .",
    "similar baryogenesis can be also realized in gravity mediation . in the gravity - mediated susy",
    "breaking , the mssm gaugino masses are generated by planck - scale suppressed interactions with an elementary gauge singlet field called the polonyi field .",
    "since it is a singlet under any symmetry of the theory , there is no special point in its field space .",
    "therefore , during inflation , the polonyi field is generically deviated from the true minimum , as the effective potential for the polonyi field during inflation is deformed by its gravitational couplings with the inflaton .",
    "after inflation , the polonyi starts to oscillate about the minimum with an amplitude of order the planck scale , and soon dominates the energy density of the universe .",
    "the polonyi field will decay into the mssm gauge sector , and thus the baryogenesis by the polonyi decay will be possible .",
    "in particular , a sizable a - term as well as large cp phases are naturally generated in the gravity mediation , which nicely fits with the current scenario .",
    "the resultant baryon asymmetry is similar to ( [ eq : etab ] ) if the modulus mass is replaced with the polonyi mass , which is order of the gravitino mass .",

    "<S> we study a scenario for baryogenesis in modular cosmology and discuss its implications for the moduli stabilization mechanism and the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking scale . </S>",
    "<S> if moduli fields dominate the universe and decay into the standard model particles through diatonic couplings , the right amount of baryon asymmetry can be generated through cp violating decay of gluino into quark and squark followed by baryon - number violating squark decay . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in the kklt - type moduli stabilization , at least two non - perturbative terms are required to obtain a sizable cp phase , and that the successful baryogenesis is possible for the soft susy breaking mass heavier than @xmath0tev . </S>",
    "<S> a part of the parameter space for successful baryogenesis can be probed at the collider experiments , dinucleon decay search experiment , and the measurements of electric dipole moments of neutron and electron . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that similar baryogenesis works in the case of the gravitino- or the saxion - dominated universe . </S>"
