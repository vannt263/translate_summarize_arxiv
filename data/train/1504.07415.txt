    "dark matter ( dm ) constitutes about @xmath9 of the energy - matter budget of universe , significantly more than @xmath10 of baryonic matter@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the exact nature of dm is kept mysterious so far .",
    "yet it is still unclear whether dm can be described by scalar , fermion , vector or even graviton .    among various dm candidates ,",
    "dark photon has been the one of particular interest .",
    "the idea was initialed in 1980s @xcite , and developed in recent years @xcite@xcite .",

    "the gauge boson of @xmath11 , named dark photon , interacts with sm @xmath12 gauge boson via a kinetic mixing term .",
    "it helps to explain the astrophysical observation of positron excesses @xcite , as well as other astrophysical phenomenology such as supernova bounds @xcite and big bang nucleosynthesis@xcite .",
    "the direct search of dark photon , for example xenon 100 , has put a very strong constraint @xcite . for @xmath13 collider",
    ", a recent search performed at babar shows a null result , neither finds nor rules out dark photon @xcite .",
    "a further experiment , the heavy photon search ( hps ) experiment located at jefferson lab @xcite , is designed to search dark photon in the mass range @xmath14 to @xmath15 as well as the related coupling .",
    "however , it has been realized recently that a simple dark photon is not favored by @xmath16 deviation of muon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "given the fact that dark photon model is the extreme case when the parameter to describe @xmath0-@xmath1 mass mixing is closed in a more generic dark @xmath0 model , it is necessary to extend dark photon to dark @xmath0 which is the working frame of this paper .",
    "flavor physics is not only taken as a platform for precise test of sm , but also plays an important role in indirect search of new physics ( np ) beyond standard model ( sm ) .",
    "great progresses have already been made since lhc runs .",
    "for example , it was hoped for decades that np might exist in zero crossing point @xmath17 of the differential branching ratio of @xmath18 ( see for example @xcite ) but finally turned out tiny np effect@xcite .",
    "taken dm theory as one kind of ordinary np theory , flavor physics then would provide as a complementary way for conventional approaches of dm study , including direct detection , indirect detection and collider production . based on the great achievement made in run i ,",
    "the lhc has already started its run ii in 2015 .",
    "then it would be interesting , and timely , to connect together these two different fields , dark matter and flavor physics .",
    "a similar effort can also be found in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will briefly set up the dark @xmath0 model .",
    "an exact result of @xmath1 penguin and further modifications to @xmath2 functions are given in section 3 .",
    "some typical processes which are affected by the @xmath1 including the recently measured @xmath18 and @xmath4 , as well as @xmath5 and @xmath19 are discussed in section 4 , also the relevant formulas are given therein . in section 5",
    "the obtained numerical results are shown , based on which we will make a discussion .",
    "the details of @xmath1 penguin calculation can be found in appendix .",
    "suppose there exits an extra @xmath20 group , other than sm @xmath20 , what it brings in phenomenology is an interesting question .",
    "it was considered how electromagnetic charge is shifted by this extra @xmath20 group in the initial paper @xcite . until recently it becomes popular to take this @xmath20 gauge boson as a dm candidate .    under the dark group ,",
    "notated as @xmath11 , all the sm interactions are invariant .",
    "the connection between dark photon with sm particles is from a kinetic mixing term , leading to the effective lagrangian @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is weinberg angle , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are dark photon and sm @xmath25 field with the corresponding field strength @xmath26 and the mixing of gauge bosons is mimicked by parameter @xmath27 , which is supposed to be small and need to be determined .",
    "the convention above , in gauge interaction state , is not diagonalized . by redefining fields as , @xmath28 the lagrangian",
    "is then rotated to a diagonal form @xmath29 note here the field after rotation with a subscript @xmath30 differs from the one before rotation with a hat . in sm the @xmath25 field can be projected to photon and @xmath0 after spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) .",
    "incorporating @xmath31 , the related neutral gauge fields are shifted , @xmath32 the rotation does not change the definition of @xmath31 , however , photon and @xmath0 field are modified indeed . due to this modification of gauge fields , the interaction between @xmath31 and ordinary matter is induced , which is named as dark photon model .",
    "when @xmath31-@xmath33 mass mixing is considered , the simple dark photon model is then extended to dark @xmath0 model .",
    "generally speaking , the mass of @xmath1 could either be added by hand which is called stckelberg mechanism@xcite ( the origin of stckelberg photon , for example , is discussed in string theory@xcite ) or by applying higgs mechanism , see @xcite as an example . in this paper , we shall adopt the treatment of @xmath1 mass in the latter case , without involving the details of the mechanism itself .",
    "after the neutral gauge bosons obtain mass after ssb , a further rotation is required after the one in eq.([eq : rot1 ] ) for diagonalising mass matrix @xmath34 where the rotation angle @xmath35 is model dependent and analytically might be complicated , but numerically should be small , ( for example , see @xcite ) .",

    "( [ eq : rot2 ] ) , the modifications to photon and @xmath0 by dark @xmath0 shows    @xmath36    formally the shift of neutral fields in dark photon model is characterised by two independent parameters @xmath27 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "in fact @xmath37 also has a lengthy analytical expression based on detailed model .",

    "also hereafter is denoted as @xmath1 , with original sm field denoted with a hat .",
    "the two coupling constants together with @xmath1 mass constitute the unique @xmath38 model parameters of dark z , which could be measured in experiments .",
    "apparently the interactions between @xmath1 and sm particles are simply induced by the shifted neutral gauge field .",
    "explicitly , we show how @xmath1 couples to sm fermions , @xmath39 in which the sm electrical current and weak neutral current are @xmath40 where @xmath41 stands for fermions with corresponding electric charge @xmath42 , isospin @xmath43 . with both vector coupling and axial - vector coupling",
    ", @xmath1 behaves as a light version of @xmath0 and heavier version of photon . for the coupling of @xmath1 and other gauge bosons",
    ", it has both `` @xmath0 component '' and `` @xmath44 component '' sized by @xmath27 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "as current energy frontier , the lhc brings plentiful opportunities for flavour physics which dominated by flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes . in this section , we will investigate these processes of meson physics in dark @xmath0 model .",
    "it is known in sm fcnc processes are induced at loop level .",
    "conventionally the feynman diagrams contributing to fcnc can be classified to three point penguin diagram and four point box diagram .",
    "if np exists , the new interaction brought in by np will modify parts / all of these sm penguin and box contribution . within the @xmath1 model working frame",
    ", however , this modification is only applied in photon penguin and @xmath0 penguin , keeping box diagram contribution unchanged . to make the new effect more distinguishable",
    ", we extract these modifications alone and name it as @xmath1-penguin specifically .",
    "we take @xmath45 as an example , noting similar result can be applied to @xmath46 and @xmath47 when necessary conditions are satisfied .    in feynman - t hooft gauge",

    "below since we focus on semileptonic processes thus only the virtual photon vertex is taken into account . in order to keep the final result the same structure as photon penguin ,",
    "the @xmath37 component differs from sm @xmath0 penguin by neglecting dipole term contribution .",
    "an exact calculation , shown in appendix [ sec : appendix ] , gives the @xmath1 penguin vertex as @xmath54 in which @xmath55 @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 is outgoing momentum carried by gauge boson .",

    "we also assume the light @xmath1 mass smaller than the mass threshold for muon pair production , which guarantees no @xmath1 resonance is produced when final state of charged lepton is muon .",
    "also in this work we will not touch electron and neutrino as the lepton final state for the production of @xmath1 when @xmath64 is above electron threshold .",
    "nevertheless , it is safe to neglect @xmath64 in this paper .      in the state - of - the - art effective hamiltonian approach",
    ", physical observables can be factorized into short distance ( sd ) and long distance ( ld ) contribution .",
    "the sd part is treated in perturbative theory while ld hadronic matrix resorts to various methods including lattice qcd .",
    "the sd contribution gives various combination of penguin diagrams and box diagrams and leads to he so - called @xmath2 functions , which also depends on both the theoretical working frame and the calculated physical observable .",
