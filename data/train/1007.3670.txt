    "extending general relativity ( gr ) to more general actions with respect to the hilbert - einstein one is revealing a very fruitful approach in modern physics . from a conceptual point of view",
    ", there is no _ a priori _ reason to restrict the gravitational lagrangian to a linear function of the ricci scalar @xmath1 , minimally coupled with matter .",
    "the idea that there are no `` exact '' laws of physics but that the lagrangians of physical interactions are `` stochastic '' functions  with the property that local gauge invariances ( i.e. conservation laws ) are well approximated in the low energy limit and that physical constants can vary  has been recently taken into serious consideration .    beside fundamental physics motivations ,",
    "all these theories have acquired a huge interest in cosmology due to the fact that they  naturally `` exhibit inflationary behaviors able to overcome the shortcomings of cosmological standard model .",
    "furthermore , dark energy models mainly rely on the implicit assumption that einstein s gr is the correct theory of gravity , indeed .",
    "nevertheless , its validity at the larger astrophysical and cosmological scales has never been tested and it is therefore conceivable that both cosmic speed up and missing matter represent signals of a breakdown in our understanding of gravitation law so that one should consider the possibility that the hilbert - einstein lagrangian , linear in the ricci scalar @xmath1 , should be generalized . following this line of thinking , the choice of a generic function @xmath0 can be derived by matching the data and by the ' ' economic \" requirement that no exotic ingredients have to be added .",
    "this is the underlying philosophy of what is referred to as @xmath0gravity @xcite . in this context , the same cosmological constant",
    "could be removed as an ingredient of the cosmic pie being nothing else but a particular eigenvalue of a general class of theories @xcite .",
    "however @xmath0gravity can be encompassed in the extended theories of gravity being a `` minimal '' extension of gr where functions of ricci scalar are taken into account .",
    "although such gravity theories have received much attention in cosmology , since they are naturally able to give rise to accelerating expansions ( both in the late and in the early universe ) and systematic studies of the phase space of solutions are in progress @xcite , it is possible to demonstrate that @xmath0theories can also play a major role at astrophysical scales @xcite .    despite these encouraging results ,",
    "a major conceptual problem has not been solved indeed : the description of dynamics can be pursued in metric , affine and metric - affine approaches with different results ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this means that the affine connection can not be simply levi - civita , implying that the geodesic and causal structure coincide as in the metric approach , but it could be endowed with a richer geometric structure .",
    "for example , if the spacetime is @xmath2 and not @xmath3 as in riemannian geometry , torsion fields have to be considered and connection is not simply levi - civita @xcite .",
    "the consequence of this fact is that geodesic structure and causal structure of spacetime can be disentangled @xcite . probing this feature is a fundamental issue that could have dramatic consequences since",
    "further degrees of freedom , like spin or the different types of torsion , should be considered into dynamics @xcite .",
    "searching for experimental probes in this direction is a urgent problem faced by several authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will take into account the metric - affine formulation of @xmath0-gravity and put in evidence that the difference between a theory _  la _ palatini and a theory with torsion can be reconducted to the difference between affine connections that results in the relative variation of a scalar field .",
    "such a scalar field is endowed with the further degrees of freedom by which @xmath0-gravity differs from gr where @xmath4 .",
    "assuming that the effect of such a field is a further scalar mode in the relic cosmic background of gravitational waves ( gws ) , we consider that the possible detection of such a mode could result , for example , as a probe of torsion . on the other hand , the absence of such a component could be a confirmation that the connection is actually levi - civita .",
    "besides , detecting new gravitational modes could be a sort of _ experimentum crucis _ in order to discriminate among theories since this fact would be the  signature \" that gr should be enlarged or modified @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ tre ] , we give an overview of metric ",
    "affine @xmath0gravity theories .",

    "[ sei ] , we investigate the response of a single detector to a gw propagating in certain direction with each polarization mode .",
    "[ sette ] is devoted to the discussion of the spectrum of the gw stochastic background where the further scalar mode is considered .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "in metric  affine @xmath0- gravity , the ( gravitational ) dynamical fields are pairs @xmath5 consisting of a pseudo  riemannian metric @xmath6 and a linear connection @xmath7 on the space - time manifold @xmath8 . in the palatini approach , the connection @xmath7 is torsionless but it is not requested to be metric ",
    "compatible , instead , in the approach with torsion , the dynamical connection @xmath9 is forced to be metric but it is allowed to have torsion different from zero .",
    "the field equations are derived from an action functional of the form @xmath10 where @xmath0 is a real function , @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 ) is the scalar curvature associated with the connection @xmath7 and @xmath13 is a suitable material lagrangian .",
    "assuming that the material lagrangian does not depend on the dynamical connection , the field equations are @xmath14 @xmath15 for @xmath0-gravity with torsion @xmath16 @xcite , and @xmath17 @xmath18    for @xmath0-gravity in the palatini approach @xcite . in eqs . and",

    "the curvature scalar @xmath21 can be expressed as a suitable function of @xmath27 , namely @xmath28 if @xmath29 , gr plus the cosmological constant is recovered @xcite . defining the scalar field @xmath30",

    "therefore , if the dynamical connection @xmath7 is not coupled with matter , both the theories ( with torsion and palatini  like ) generate identical einstein  like field equations .    on the contrary ,",
    "the field equations for dynamical connection are different and ( in general ) give rise to different solutions .",

    "the connections @xmath9 and @xmath43 satisfy the relation @xmath44 of course , the einstein  like equations are coupled with the matter field equations . in this respect , it is worth pointing out that eqs .",
    "imply the same conservation laws holding in gr @xcite .",
    "an important consideration is in order at this point .",
    "the difference between the affine connections in theories with torsion and _  la _ palatini is characterized by the relative variation of the scalar field @xmath45 , which is determined by the matter - energy @xmath46 .",
    "assuming such a difference as a perturbation in a fixed conformal background , we can investigate if a scalar mode of gravitational radiation could be related with it .",
    "this will be the argument of the next section .",
    "the geodesic structure of metric - affine @xmath0-gravity could be tested by detecting a further polarization in gravitational radiation related to a scalar mode . to be more precise",
    ", the scalar field is a way to define the further gravitational degrees of freedom emerging from @xmath0-gravity .",
    "the total gw has to be a function of the standard modes coming from gr and modes coming from these further degrees of freedom , that is @xmath47 .",
    "the following derivation will show this statement .",
    "let us consider a small perturbation on a conformal background characterized by a minkowskian spacetime on which a scalar field @xmath48 is defined .",
    "perturbing the background at first order , we obtain    @xmath49    from these linearized quantities , it is possible to derive the related curvature invariants @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 and the field equations :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 ( see @xcite for details ) . on the other hand , such equations can be obtained directly starting from the field eqs.([2.7 ] ) with the potential ( [ 2.8 ] ) .",

    "according to the derivation of previous section , it could characterize the fact that connection is not levi - civita and then the geodesic structure of the theory could be distinguishable with respect to the causal structure . in fig.1 , we illustrate how each gw polarization affects test masses arranged on a circle .",

    "this is relevant to deal with ground - based laser interferometers but this condition could not be valid when dealing with space interferometers like lisa .",
    "however , more accurate studies have to be pursued on this issue .",

    "a typical antenna pattern presents some maxima of sensitivity ( lobes ) ; the strongest of these maxima ( the main lobe ) defines the direction in which the antenna is most sensitive @xcite .",
    "these considerations indicate that the signal related to the scalar component ( [ 5_3 ] ) is , in principle , detectable .",
    "our results are consistent , for example , with those in @xcite .",
    "another possibility to investigate the presence of gw - scalar components is to consider the stochastic background of gws as we will do in the next section .",

    "it directly derives from the inflationary scenario @xcite , which well fit the wmap data that are in particular good agreement with almost exponential inflation and spectral index @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "a remarkable fact about the inflationary scenario is that it contains a natural mechanism which gives rise to perturbations for any field .",
    "it is important for our aims that such a mechanism provides also a distinctive spectrum for relic scalar gws .",
    "these perturbations , in inflationary cosmology , arise from the most basic quantum mechanical effect : the uncertainty principle . in this way , the spectrum of relic gws that we could detect today is nothing else but the adiabatically - amplified zero - point fluctuations @xcite . the calculation for a simple inflationary model can be performed for the scalar field component .",

    "every classical or macroscopic perturbation is damped out by the inflation , i.e. the minimum allowed level of fluctuations is that required by the uncertainty principle .",
    "solution ( [ eq : ampiezza inflaz .",
    "] ) corresponds to a de sitter vacuum state . if the period of inflation is long enough , the today observable properties of the universe should be indistinguishable from the properties of a universe started in the de sitter vacuum state . in the radiation dominated phase , the eigenmodes which describe particles are the coefficients of @xmath139 while @xmath140- coefficients describe antiparticles ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the number of particles created at angular frequency @xmath147 in the radiation dominated phase is @xmath148 furthermore , it is possible to write an expression for the energy density of the stochastic background of scalar relic gravitons in the frequency interval @xmath149 as @xmath150 where @xmath117 , as above , is the frequency in standard comoving time .",

    "first of all , such a calculation works for a simplified model that does not include the matter dominated era .",

    "( [ eq : spettro gravitoni ] ) and ( [ eq : spettro gravitoni redshiftato ] ) , which are not frequency dependent , do not work correctly in all the range of physical frequencies . for waves with frequencies less than today observed @xmath157 , the notion of energy density has no sense since the wavelength becomes longer than the hubble scale of the universe . in analogous way , at high frequencies , there is a maximal frequency above which the spectrum rapidly drops to zero . in the above calculation , the simple assumption that the phase transition from the inflationary to the radiation dominated epoch is instantaneous has been made . in the physical universe",
    ", this process occurs over some time scale @xmath159 , being @xmath160 which is the redshifted rate of the transition . in any case , @xmath112 drops rapidly .",
    "the two cutoffs at low and high frequencies for the spectrum guarantee that the total energy density of the relic scalar gravitons is finite . for grand unified theories energy - scale inflation ,",

    "in fact , it is well known that wmap observations put severe restrictions on the spectrum . considering the ratio @xmath162 , the relic scalar gw spectrum seems consistent with the wmap constraints on scalar perturbations .",
    "nevertheless , since the spectrum falls off @xmath163 at low frequencies , this means that today , at ligo - virgo and lisa frequencies , one gets @xmath164 it is interesting to calculate the corresponding strain at @xmath165 , where interferometers like virgo and ligo reach a maximum in sensitivity .",
    "the well known equation for the characteristic amplitude @xcite adapted to the scalar component of gws can be used : @xmath166 and then we obtain @xmath167    then , since we expect a sensitivity of the order of @xmath168 for the above interferometers at @xmath169 , we need to gain four order of magnitude .",

    "in this paper , we have investigated the possibility that metric - affine @xmath0 theories could be distinguished from purely metric ones , by considering the difference in affine connections which result in the relative variation of a suitable scalar field .",
    "the absence of such a variation , that is @xmath175 , is the indication that the connection is levi - civita . in other words , geodesic structure and causal structure of the theory",
    "coincide . on the other hand , if @xmath176 a more general theory , formulated onto a @xmath2 manifold , has to be considered . in principle , such an issue could be tested at a fundamental level by detecting possible scalar modes of gws .",
    "this is the key point of this paper .",
    "in this perspective , we have investigated the detectability of additional polarization modes of a stochastic gw background by ground - based laser - interferometric detectors and space - interferometers .",
    "such polarization modes , in general , appear in the extended theories of gravitation and can be utilized to constrain the theories beyond gr in a model - independent way . however",
    ", a point has to be discussed in detail .",
    "if the interferometer is directionally sensitive and we also know the orientation of the source ( and of course if the source is coherent ) the situation is straightforward . in this case , the massive mode coming from @xmath0-gravity would induce longitudinal displacements along the direction of propagation which should be detectable and only the amplitude due to the scalar mode would be the true , detectable , `` new '' signal @xcite . on the other hand , in the case of the stochastic background , there is no coherent source and no directional detection of the gravitational radiation .",
    "what the interferometer picks is just an averaged signal coming from the contributions of all possible modes from ( uncorrelated ) sources all over the celestial sphere .",
    "since we expect the background to be isotropic , the signal will be the same regardless of the orientation of the interferometer , no matter how or on which plane it is rotated , it would always record the characteristic amplitude @xmath177 .",
    "so there is intrinsically no way to disentangle any of the mode in the background , being @xmath177 related to the total energy density of the gravitational radiation , which depends on the number of modes available .",
    "this is the why we have considered only @xmath71 in the above cross - correlation analysis without giving further fine details coming from polarization .",
    "for the situation considered here , we have found that the massive modes are certainly of interest for direct attempts of detection by the lisa experiment .",
    "it is , in principle , possible that massive gw modes could be produced in more significant quantities in cosmological or early astrophysical processes in alternative theories of gravity .",
    "this situation should be kept in mind when looking for a signature distinguishing these theories from gr , and seems to deserve further investigation . from our point of view",
    ", it is of extremely importance since it could allow to distinguish the same structure of the space - time .",
    "however , some further considerations are necessary at this point . according to @xcite , @xmath0-gravity in metric formalism",
    "can be presented as an effective dark fluid assuming both the role of dark energy and dark matter .",
    "evidently , metric - affine @xmath0-gravity may be also presented as ( different ) effective dark fluid .",
    "the above results could contribute in discriminating between the two approaches , if the signature of affine connections is experimentally selected .",
    "in particular , torsion could have a relevant role in structure formation and in coincidence problem between dark energy and dark matter as discussed in @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "dynamics is richer than that presented in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that not all metric @xmath0-gravity model may pass local tests , like brans - dicke test , newton law , etc .",
    "the aim is to find out self - consistent models matching solar system scales with extragalactic and cosmological scales . in @xcite , criteria and several explicit models which pass local tests",
    "are given .",
    "in this paper , we have not faced this problem since we are using general @xmath0-gravity models with the only request that they are analytic and taylor expandable .",
    "these are sufficient conditions to discuss scalar gws . in order to construct a reliable theory , also",
    "the problem of background has to be considered together with the stochastic gws .",
    "this will be the argument of forthcoming researches aimed to achieve comprehensive and self - consistent models .",
