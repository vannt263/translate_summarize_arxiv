    "conditional measurements in the atom field interaction @xcite , i.e. projections of the entangled state onto a selected atomic state once the atom and field have interacted and the atom has exit the cavity , carrying the information of the field inside it , have been used to produce nonclassical states of light such as schrdinger cat states @xcite or more complex superpositions of coherent states @xcite that may lead to generation of numbers states .",
    "gosh and gerry @xcite have shown that a class of nonclassical states may be produced by such conditional measurements which luis @xcite called paradoxical , as he showed that a measurement leading to absorption of light produced an increase of the number of photons .",
    "more recently , valverde and baseia @xcite have studied such paradoxical generation of nonclassical states in models of interpolating hamiltonians , in particular of the ( nonlinear ) jaynes - cummings type .",
    "here we show that conditional measurements can lead efficiently to multiphoton processes @xcite , and in this way , a resonant interaction that allows single - photon exchange of energy between atom and field @xcite may generate , via highly probable conditional measurements , the creation or annihilation of more than one photons in the cavity .",
    "because the atom - field interaction may be modeled in other type of systems , namely ion - laser interactions @xcite , the results shown here may be translated to such systems , where one could use this effect to cool trapped ions .",
    "consider the interaction hamiltonian for the on - resonance interaction of an atom and a quantized field ( @xmath0 is set to one ) @xmath1 the operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the annihilation and creation operators , the parameter @xmath4 is the so - called rabi frequency and the atomic operators , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are the lowering and raising pauli matrices , respectively .",
    "we can obtain the evolution operator , @xmath7 , by expanding the exponential in taylor series ; the even and odd powers may be written as ( we use the pauli matrices in their @xmath8 matrix notation ) @xcite @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 the london phase operator @xcite .",
    "so , we may obtain the evolution operator in the form @xmath12 if we consider an initial coherent state for the field , @xmath13 , with its distribution in terms of number states given by @xmath14 are the fock states , and an excited state for the atom , the initial wavefunction is given by @xmath15 we obtain the evolved wavefunction as @xmath16 , that in the ( complete ) ket notation is written as @xmath17 and @xmath18 are given by @xmath19 may be written as a schmidt decomposition @xcite @xmath20 are the eigenvalues of the atomic density matrix an the orthonormal field wavefunctions are written as @xmath21 the quantities @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are related as follows @xmath26 and @xmath27 by measuring the atom as it exits the cavity in the @xmath28 state , i.e. doing a conditional measurement of the atom in that specific schmidt state , the field is projected to the normalized state @xmath29 . from it , we can calculate the average number of photons , @xmath30 .",
    "we plot this quantity as a function of @xmath31 in figure 1 , where it is shown that an increase ( after a severe decrease ) of the average number of photons would occur for certain times ( where the maximums happens ) .",
    "of course , although it may be seen as a surprising effect such nonlinear generation of photons in the cavity , it may be understood by the fact that a distribution of photons is initially considered as well as the fact that the conditional measurement is in itself a non - unitary process .    .",
    "the field is initially in a coherent state with ( a ) @xmath32 , ( b ) @xmath33 and ( c ) @xmath34 . ]    in figure 2 , we plot ( dashed line ) the probability of such events occurring .",
    "we see that for the first maximum of the solid line in figure 1 , @xmath35 , the probability shown in figure 2 is a minimum yielding a probability of approximately @xmath36 percent .",
    "it may be also seen that all the maximums happen with minimum probability , although this probability increases such that the second relevant multiphoton processhas a probability to occur greater than 20 percent .    )",
    "of measuring the atom after it exits the cavity in the ground state ( solid line ) or excited state ( dash line ) . ]    in figure 3 , we plot the mandel-@xmath37 parameter @xcite @xmath38 as a function of @xmath31 where the generation of nonclassical states may be seen for times for which the mandel-@xmath37 parameter is less than zero .",
    "parameter as a function of @xmath31 for the state @xmath29 the field is initially in a coherent state with ( a ) @xmath32 , ( b ) @xmath33 and ( c ) @xmath34 . ]    in figure 4 ( b ) , we plot the photon distribution , @xmath39 as a function of @xmath40 for @xmath32 and @xmath35 . a deviation from the original distribution , figure 4 ( a ) , centered at @xmath41",
    "may be seen , as the one obtained from a conditional measurement may be seen centered at about @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , an increase of the average number of photons greater than one , i.e. a multiphoton process , takes place .",
    "this figure resembles that of a squeezed state @xcite .",
    "in fact , squeezed light has been predicted in the jaynes - cummings model by kuklinski and madajczyk @xcite and its interaction with two - level atoms studied by satyanarayana _",
    "_ @xcite and moya - cessa and vidiella - barranco @xcite .     and ( b ) the conditional state @xmath29 , with @xmath32 and an interaction time @xmath43 . ]     or @xmath44 state , respectively . ]",
    "we have shown that , after an atom resonantly interacts with a field , the average number of photons inside the cavity is severely affected by measuring it when it exits it .",
    "we call this a multiphoton process as the atom - field interaction allows the exchange of only single photons , but the conditional measurement generates the creation or absorption of several photons in the cavity .",
    "we have shown , numerically , that such effects are related to the initial number of photons in the cavity for both coherent states and thermal distributions giving rise to the addition or subtraction proportional to the square of the initial average number of photons .",
