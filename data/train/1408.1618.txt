    "the discovery of an infrared excess around a single white dwarf g29 - 38 @xcite from an orbiting dust disk @xcite has helped lay the foundation for the study of planetary systems around white dwarfs .",
    "however , it was not until much later that a now widely - accepted model was proposed to explain the source of the dust  tidal disruption of planetesimals @xcite .",
    "subsequent progress has been rapid , particularly after the discovery of an infrared excess around a second white dwarf gd 362 @xcite .",
    "various dynamical pathways have been explored to deliver the planetesimals into the white dwarf tidal radius @xcite . eventually , all these materials get accreted onto the white dwarf and enrich its pure hydrogen or / and helium atmosphere . studying these heavy - element - enriched white dwarfs",
    "has become a uniquely powerful way to directly measure the bulk compositions of extrasolar planetesimals @xcite .    to - date ,",
    "mainly thanks to the launch of the spitzer space telescope , more than 30 dusty white dwarfs have been identified @xcite .",
    "the seds can be fit with a geomterically thin , optically thick disk within the tidal radius of the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the typical disk lifetime is estimated to be 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath4 yr @xcite .",
    "the disk occurrence rate is about 4% for white dwarfs between 9500 - 22,500 k @xcite . despite intensive searches ,",
    "only one disk host star g166 - 58 has an effective temperature less than 9500 k @xcite .",
    "when observed with a high - resolution optical / ultraviolet spectrograph , all dusty white dwarfs show a high level of atmospheric enrichment of heavy elements .",
    "circumstellar gaseous material has also been detected around some white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "there are a lot of puzzles regarding these dusty white dwarfs .",
    "how massive is the dust disk ?",
    "how does the disk evolve with time ?",
    "why do some of them show calcium triplet emission lines from the circumstellar gas while others do not ?",
    "in addition , these emission lines appear to be variable on timescale of a few years @xcite .",
    "what causes such variability ?    in this paper , we report the first result from a systematic study of infrared variability for dusty white dwarfs .",
    "we focus on one target , wd j0959@xmath00200 , whose fluxes have decreased by @xmath2 35% in the infrared .",
    "most dusty white dwarfs have been observed with the infrared array camera ( irac ) @xcite at 3 - 10 @xmath1 m , where the disk emits most of its flux . when the wise data became available , we compared the fluxes of all dusty white dwarfs at w-1 with irac-1 and w-2 with irac-2 .",
    "we found that the flux level was comparable for the majority of them but a few showed disparities larger than 3 sigma ; most of them have a larger wise fluxes due to the lower spatial resolution of wise and contamination from background sources ( also see figure [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "in particular , five white dwarfs were in a clean field with no obvious contaminating source in the irac image and this discrepancy can be real .",
    "we were awarded spitzer time in cycle 10 to re - investigate these five targets .",
    "the program is still on - going and we report the result of wd j0959@xmath00200 in this paper .",
    "wd j0959@xmath00200 is a hydrogen - dominated white dwarf discovered from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) with a k band excess from the ukirt ( united kingdom infrared telescope ) infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) @xcite .",
    "follow - up observation from spitzer shows that this star indeed has an infrared excess from an orbiting dust disk .",
    "spectroscopic observations with the very large telescope ( vlt ) show photospheric absorption lines from calcium , magnesium as well as infrared calcium triplet emission @xcite . with a stellar temperature of 13,280 k ,",
    "wd j0959@xmath00200 is the coolest dusty white dwarf with circumstellar gaseous material , whose effective temperatures range between 13,280 k and 20,700 k. in comparison , dusty white dwarfs typically have a temperature range of 9500 - 23,100 k @xcite .",
    "because a large portion of the k band flux for wd j0959@xmath00200 is also from the dust disk , we obtained additional jhk photometry with the ukirt .",
    "the observing logs are presented in table [ tab : photometry ] .",

    "the observing strategy and data analysis were described in @xcite .",
    "we reobserved this target in 2014 ( pi : m. jura ) with a similar configuration  30 sec exposure with 30 medium size dithers in the cycling pattern , resulting in a total of 900 sec on target time in each channel .",
    "following data reduction procedures outlined in @xcite and @xcite , we used mopex to create the final mosaic of 06 pixel@xmath5 , as shown in figure [ fig : image ] . in the irac bands ,",
    "wd j0959@xmath00200 is well separated from all nearby sources .",
    "however , there is a background source 57 away , which could affect the wise results ( see section [ wise ] ) .",

    "relative to the 2010 data , we find that the flux for wd j0959@xmath00200 decreased 35 @xmath6 4 % and 34 @xmath6 4 % in irac-1 and irac-2 , respectively . for a sanity check , we also measured the fluxes of 10 nearby stars that have comparable fluxes and are in a clean field .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : comp ] , the standard deviation between the two epochs for the comparison targets is 1.3% in irac-1 and 2.0% in irac-2 , much smaller than the observed flux differences for wd j0959@xmath00200 .",

    "a caveat here is that there are 4 years between the ukidss and irac data and there could have been additional changes in the disk .",

    "the fractional luminosity has dropped to 0.02 , which is still on the high side for dusty white dwarfs .",

    "with all the available data , an increase of the inner disk radius from 10.5@xmath17 r@xmath10 to 14.0@xmath18 r@xmath10 is the most plausible explanation for the drop of the infrared luminosity of wd j0959@xmath00200 .",

    "future high precision , high cadence infrared photometric observations will be essential to disentangle different scenarios .",
    "if we can measure the photospheric abundance when the infrared flux is changing , we may have the opportunity of witnessing the specific composition of an incoming planetesimal .",
