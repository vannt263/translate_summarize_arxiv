    "blazars are the extreme class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "they show variable continuum emission over the whole energy spectrum along with high ( @xmath5 ) and variable polarization in the radio and the optical energy bands . according to the agn unification model",
    ", blazars have a relativistic jet of plasma , perpendicular to the accretion disk , emanating from very close to the central black hole and aligned at a very small angle to the line of sight(@xmath6 ) @xcite . due to the relativistic aberration and boosting effects ,",
    "the emission from blazars is dominated by the jet .",
    "the variability in their emitted flux provides an important tool to study the central engine in agns since these remain spatially unresolved even by the best observing facilities of the day .",
    "the observed timescales of the flux variability provide clues to the size of the emission region and the processes responsible for the emission .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the blazars has a characteristic double - peaked shape with a low frequency component peaking somewhere in sub - mm to x - rays energy band , and a high frequency component , peaking at the mev - tev energies .",
    "the low energy component of the sed is well explained as the synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in the jet @xcite , while the physics behind the high energy component is not yet well understood .",
    "it is proposed that the high energy flux is produced by the inverse compton scattering of the low energy seed photons by the highly energetic particles ( electrons / postitrons ) .",
    "the origin of these seed photons can either be the synchrotron emission itself ( synchrotron self compton , ssc ; @xcite ) or the sources external to the emission region , e.g. , accretion disk , broad line region , torus etc ( external compton , ec ) .",
    "several models have already been proposed to explain source of the seed photons responsible for the high energy emission in blazars @xcite . in order to constrain the models for the high energy flux generation in blazars , study of the light - curves and the seds of a sample of blazars",
    "is needed using long term , simultaneous multi - wavelength data .",
    "depending upon the position of the synchrotron peak in seds , blazars are sub - classified into a sequence ; flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , radio - selected bl lac objects ( or lbl ) , and x - ray - selected bl lac objects ( or hbl ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these sub - classes are known to have some intrinsically different properties .",
    "for example , their bolometric luminosity decreases from fsrq to hbl as does the dominance of the @xmath1-ray emission @xcite .",
    "similarly , lbls are reported to have , on the average , higher degree of polarization ( dp ) and amplitude of variation than the hbls .",
    "@xcite ascribe this difference in the dp to the differences in their beaming with lbls showing stronger beaming .",
    "recently , @xcite found only a marginal difference in the polarization behaviour of the lbls and the hbls as inferred from their sample of probable blazar candidates taken from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "however , their inference could be affected by the low statistics as they considered 8 lbls and 37 hbls in their sample . on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite report , based on the studies of their samples , that lbls generally have a higher dp than hbls .    in an earlier work , @xcite",

    "the last two panels , ( e ) and ( f ) , show the variations in nightly averaged degree of polarization and position angle as discussed in @xcite . in the following",
    "we discuss each component individually and in relation with source behaviour in other wavebands .",
    "the visual inspection of fig .",
    "1(f ) clearly shows that emission was highly polarized @xmath33 on mjd 55591.38 ( 2011 january 30 ) , indicating a highly aligned magnetic field in the emission region .",
    "the dp gradually decreased to @xmath34 on 2011 february 01 ( mjd 55593.44 ) at a rate of @xmath35 per day .",
    "dp then increases again at a relatively slower rate ( @xmath36 per day ) over next two days .",
    "the pa follows the similar trend with a difference that it decreases on 2011 february 03 .",
    "the variation in dp can be explained using intrinsic models such as shock in jet model , fresh injection of matter in the jet etc . , depending on the time - scale and nature of changes observed .",
    "the change in pa is unlikely to be caused in a straight , uniform axially symmetric , matter dominated jet just by shock compression of plasma in the emission region .",
    "the interaction with a perpendicular shock moving along blazar jet can align the tangled magnetic field in the emission region , hence enhancing dp but might not result in any significant change in pa @xcite .",
    "such a change in the pa ( on day 1 , 3 and 5 ) indicates either the fresh injection of material in the jet or a change in the jet geometry .",
    "the flipping nature of pa around mjd 55594.44 appears interesting because of opposite behaviour in dp .",
    "such trend has been noticed in other blazars when dp is seen rising accompanied with sharp drops in pa .",
    "the r band light curve ( fig.1d ) shows that the source has seen its brightest moments before 2011 january 30 with the flux decreasing during 2011 january 30 - february 03 , in agreement with the trend reported by @xcite ( @xmath37 on 2011 january 27 ) .",
    "the r band light - curve also indicates to a small rise in flux between mjd 55592.4 and mjd 55595.4 around which dp and pa are showing opposite behaviour .",
    "this might be indicative of a small flaring activity , enhancing the r - band flux and dp followed by a drastic change in pa .",
    "since timescale is very small ( @xmath38 2 days ) , this flare can not be due to global bending of the jet .",
    "it possibly favors a fresh injection of plasma in the emission zone as cause for the change .",
    "the uv - optcal light - curves ( fig .",
    "1c ) show similar behaviour in all bands , albeit with a weak colour dependence .",
    "a mild bluer when brighter and redder when fainter behaviour seen is consistent with the shock - in - jet model .",
    "we notice about 20% increase in u - band energy flux during mjd 55586.8 to mjd 55590.4 ( 2011 january 26 to 29 ) . in all optical and uv bands ,",
    "the source had maxima and minima around mjd 55590 and mjd 55595.5 with values in u , b , v bands as 9.58 , 11.2 , 14.3 mjy and 7.02 , 8.1 , 10.4 mjy , respectively .",
    "r - band flux peaked on mjd 55591.4 ( 16.67mjy ) with a minimum on mjd 55595.4 ( 14.14mjy ) .",
    "the delay of about one day in the maxima and minima as seen in our r - band vis - a - vis ubv bands is possibly due only to sampling time . as shown in fig 1(b ) , xrt - swift x - ray energy flux goes up by about 50% ( from 0.18 to 0.27 mjy ) within about 4 days ( mjd 55586.4 to 55590.4 ) and then drops by 0.04 mjy within next 2.8 days . the x - ray ( 0.2 - 10.0 kev ) light - curve follows the similar trend as seen in uv bands apart from an increase in x - ray flux towards the end while fluxes in r and uv bands decrease .",
    "the maximum ( 0.28 mjy ) and minimum ( 0.16mjy ) in the x - ray light curve occur on mjd 55590.08 and mjd 55587.02 , respectively .    on 2011",
    "jan 25 @xcite reported the source to have highest ever @xmath1-ray flux on 2011 january 23 .",
    "the @xmath1-ray lightcurves shown in fig 1(a ) are obtained from fermi / lat observations with an inclusion of flux corresponding to ts @xmath39 9 ( @xmath40 ) and 3-day binning . a significant rise around 2011 january 23 and again on 2011 january 29 was noticed .",
    "the january 29 peak flux decays slowly with time reaching a minimum on mjd 55595 .",
    "this flare appears to be different from the one around 2011 january 23 , decaying part of which might have overlapped with rising part of the second ( january 29 ) flare but the peak photon flux ( 4.3@xmath41 ) is at almost same level .",
    "fig 1 shows that @xmath1-ray , x - ray , @xmath42 and optical fluxes vary largely in unison during 2011 january 25 to february 02 with light - curves in all the bands peaking somewhere near 2011 , january 29 . though there are no polarimetric observations on 2011 , january 29 , a polarization value of 12% on january 28 was reported by @xcite , followed by our measurements of @xmath43 dp two days later on january 30 .",
    "it clearly shows a trend of rapid increase in dp during january 28 - 30 followed by equally rapid drop with january 31 recording a value of 12.8% indicating dp to also peak sometime on january 29 .",
    "while pa follows dp during january 30-feb 2 , we do not know how it behaved near the peak ( january 29 ) as there are no measurements on january 28 for pa .",
    "as mentioned earlier , from 2011 february 01 ( mjd 55593.4 ) dp increases slowly while pa shows an increase upto february 02 and then decreases .",
    "interestingly , flux in the r - band also shows a mild rise on february 02 and then a sharp fall by about 10% , just like pa . a slight increase in x - ray light curve is also noticeable at this epoch .",
    "the one day averaged _ fermi_/lat flux also shows an enhancement on february 02 ( mjd 55594 ) .",
    "it might be indicative of a flicker at around mjd 55594.4 caused by the inhomogeneity in the jet , leading to enhancement in the flux and polarization accompanied with change in pa .",
    "however , nothing can be said of uvot fluxes due to the lack of the uvot pointed observations at this epoch .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that in totality , variations in fluxes in all the bands appear to be simultaneous in nature , indicating co - spatiality of the emission at all wavebands considered here",
    ". another important consequence of this result is that the fermi source 2fgl j0211.1 + 1050 , as well as x - ray counterpart are identified with bl lac object cgrabs j0211 + 1051 .",
    "however , one can not miss the differences in the nature of short term small scale fluctuations in the light curves for different energies , implying the presence of small scale inhomogeneities in the physical conditions across the source .      in order to construct sed for cgrabs  j0211 + 1051 , we used data discussed above alongwith mojave ( 2 cm ) and other ( 8.4 ghz , 4.85 ghz , 4.775 ghz and 1.4 ghz ) radio band data from ned website .",
    "we analyzed the data for the duration mjd 55580-mjd 55596 ( 2011 january 20 - february 04 ) which are quasi - simultaneous in nature .",
    "we combined the fluxes in respective energy bands for the duration data was available for a particular band , after correcting for the galactic extinction and other aberrations .",
    "we , therefore , combined 15 days data for various uvot / x - ray and @xmath1-ray energy bands from swift and lat while r - band optical data was combined for 5-days ( 2011 january 30- february 03 ) .",
    "the sed is plotted as @xmath44 on logarithmic scale in fig 2 .",
    "the filled circles in the first peak represent the fluxes in various radio bands while filled diamonds , triangles and squares represent sub - mm@xcite , infrared ( wise ) and optical uv fluxes . the x - ray 0.3 - 10 kev fluxes from xrt and high energy lat / fermi @xmath1-ray fluxes",

    "the present study , therefore , gives credence to the idea that blazars can largely be classified based on their polarization properties .",

    "we have used @xmath55 minutes , adopted from @xcite which is the most probable shortest timescale of variations in the polarized flux observed during 2011 , february 02 - 03 . in our case , size of the emission region @xmath56 is @xmath57 cm , taking a typical value of doppler factor ( @xmath58 ) as 20 .",

    ", the co - moving magnetic field comes out to be @xmath695.93 gauss which is typical value of the magnetic fields in bl lac objects ( @xmath38 few gauss ) .",
    "other quantity which we have estimated from present study is the mass of the black hole ( bh ) which is one of the most important parameter in agns .",
    "it controls the accretion rate and most of the features observed in the seds of agns .",
    "two types of methods are used for estimating mass of the black hole : primary and secondary .",
    "the primary black hole mass estimation methods include stellar and gas kinematics , reverberation mapping and mega - maser kinematics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the kinematics methods require high spatial resolution spectroscopy of the host galaxy , the reverberation mapping method requires detection of the broad emission lines from blr while mega - masers are only detectable in edge - on sources . since blazars , in particular bl lacs , have almost featureless continuum and are nearly face - on sources , all the methods mentioned above are not suitable for estimation of their black hole mass in principal .",
    "the so - called secondary black hole mass estimation methods are also either approximations to the reverberation mapping approach that still rely on the presence of an emission line or employ well - known empirical relations between the black hole mass and the velocity dispersion or mass of the host galaxy s bulge .",
    "one method which can also be used to provide a crude estimate of the mass of black hole employs time scale of the flux variability in blazars @xcite .",
    "the observed timescale of variability ( @xmath70 ) provides an upper limit to the mass of black hole with the assumption that the variation arises due to the processes occurring close to the black hole .",
    "the causality condition limits the size of the emission region to ( r @xmath71 @xmath72  c/(1+z ) ) . combining this result with the expectation that the minimum size for such an emitting region is fairly closely related to the gravitational radius of the bh , r @xmath73 rg = @xmath74 @xcite black hole mass can be estimated .",
    "we consider that fast variability timescale corresponds to the perturbations in the jet plasma , at a distance of r=5rs , with @xmath75 as schwartzchild radius",
    ". then mass of mass of the bh is @xcite , + @xmath76    the above expression can be used for a crude estimation of the black - hole mass of the blazars using variability timescale as a parameter in the absence of any direct method . using the time scale of variability considered here ,",
    "central black hole mass for this source comes out to be @xmath77 which is in agreement with the typical black hole masses of the bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "in this communication , we have used multi - wavelength observation data for the blazar cgrabsj021 + 1051 to understand its behaviour when it was undergoing a strong flare .",
    "the data on this source are very scanty and therefore it is not straight forward to discuss its detailed behaviour .",
    "we have used all available data suitable for this study in various energy regimes and found that the source shows interesting spectral behaviour .",
    "though it is a low energy peaked bl lac , its sed shows an equally strong ic component .",
    "based on the multi - wavelength light curves , we notice presence of another flare peaking sometime on 2011 january 29 , with almost similar _ fermi_/lat photon flux as reported for the 2011 january 23 flare .",
    "it appears to be a double flare when the decaying part of the first flare overlaps the rising part of the second one .",
    "the nature of the multi - wavelength light curves presented here show that they vary in unison with time , all fluxes peaking some time on january 29 .",
    "such quasi - simultaneous trend suggests that the emissions in all the energy bands are being generated in the same part of the jet , though emitting sizes might differ with frequencies .",
    "this behaviour also confirms the identification of the fermi source 2fgl j0211.2 + 1050 as bl lac counterpart cgrabs j0211 + 1051 . that the non - thermal jet emission dominates and the magnetic field in the emission region is well ordered ,",
    "are confirmed by the high degree of polarization observed .",
    "it is the first detailed multi - wavelength study , including the information on the polarization on this source .",
    "another important conclusion drawn from this work is the confirmation of this source to be an lbl , as suggested by an earlier study based on the polarization .",
    "the synchrotron peak falls in the ir region ( @xmath78 ) as shown in the sed constructed .",
    "synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) processes can be used to explain sed and various properties of the jet emission in this source .",
    "several parameters are estimated using canonical jet model , including co - moving magnetic field ( @xmath3 gauss ) in the region .",
