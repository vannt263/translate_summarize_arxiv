    "<S> in a recent letter @xcite we proposed to control atom - atom interactions at ultra - low temperatures with a dc - e . in the presence of a dc - e the spherical symmetry of the interacting atoms </S>",

    "<S> one can intuitively understand this property ( @xmath62 in the low energy limit ) based on the discussion of the @xmath63-dependence of the phase shifts of an asymptotic potential @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the couplings between different channels are essentially given by @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for each channel , the effective potential generated by the couplings , behaves in the limit of large @xmath26 as @xmath65 . </S>",

    "<S> both the magnitude and sign of the @xmath71 are tunable by changing @xmath72 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quite generally , we found that within the same @xmath18 and @xmath73 manifold the @xmath74 is always the largest @xmath71 term , and the larger @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the smaller @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> away from resonances , smaller @xmath18 and @xmath73 correspond to larger @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> such a situation allows for the general pairing schemes as in @xmath7he @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one obtain the @xmath77 gap equation ( in the weak coupling limit ) , @xmath78 where the general quasi - particle excitation spectra is @xmath79 for the homogeneous case . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath80 is the bare particle energy ( measured from the fermi surface at @xmath81 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a general pairing scheme results in an anisotropic gap @xmath82 and the excitation spectra @xmath83 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular when one of the @xmath84 is made dominant and attractive ( positive ) , we can simplify the analysis by assuming @xmath85 one then obtains the ( @xmath86 ) gap equation @xmath87 with @xmath88 . at @xmath10 , @xmath89 , </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gt ] ) can be approximately solved to give a result similar to ( [ bcst ] ) , @xmath90 except for the substitution of @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the case of a p - wave pairing with @xmath92 being the dominant ( and positive ) term is indeed true for @xmath2li , @xmath0k , and @xmath1rb in the maximum polarized state . </S>",
    "<S> these paired superfluid states are the analogues of the @xmath7he in the @xmath93 phase .    </S>",
    "<S> such a scheme is interesting since pairing involves only atoms in the same hyperfine state , yet the strength of the pairing can be as strong as that for a s - wave pairing in different hyperfine states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this greatly increases the critical temperature for the bcs pairing to occur . </S>",
    "<S> the actual values of @xmath71 are illustrated by our calculations in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , and [ fig3 ] for @xmath3li , @xmath0k , and @xmath1rb respectively . </S>",
    "<S> although hyperfine structures are not included in these calculations presented . </S>",
    "<S> we expect they give the correct order of magnitude and the @xmath72-dependence since collisions among atoms in the maximum polarized state mainly proceed along the triplet potential curves . </S>",
    "<S> we have also estimated the critical temperatures eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tc ] ) for typical trap parameters . </S>",
    "<S> they are plotted in dashed lines with respect to the logarithmic vertical axis to the right . </S>",
    "<S> the number density at the trap center is higher than the @xmath40/cm@xmath7 used for previous estimates , justified since all inelastic processes would be slower in our scheme , the same reason why the bec was originally realized in similar maximum polarized states . in the maximum polarized states , the spin exchange collisional loss is eliminated and the two - body dipolar rates are suppressed . the three body loss inside an electric field is a much more complicated issue currently under investigation . </S>",
    "<S> this rate seems highly reasonable since the centrifugal barrier in the p - wave collision channel prevents close encounters of two atoms at short distances .    </S>",
    "<S> more generally , one may consider possibilities of pairing with @xmath94 terms if resonance structures can be induced . </S>",
    "<S> such resonances may also provide larger @xmath71 values at smaller dc - e fields . </S>",
    "<S> we are currently pursuing detailed atomic collision calculations including hyperfine structures inside a dc - e to answer these questions . inside an optical trap @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> different zeeman states of the same hyperfine spin state are degenerate , but the effect of the dc - e can still be induced . in such a case </S>",
    "<S> one would expect that similar to the analysis of the anderson - brinkman - morel states and balian - werthamer states in @xmath7he @xcite , one can consider all kinds of spin symmetries of the paired atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this would represent a more interesting scenario than in the case of @xmath7he because the total spins can be much larger , e.g. for @xmath0k , @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively in the two ground hyperfine manifolds @xcite .    as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] for @xmath3li , within the range of dc - e field considered , the induced p - wave interaction is too weak for the bcs pairing to occur at reasonable temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this is a result of the small electric polarizability of @xmath3li . </S>",
    "<S> however , for @xmath0k ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) and @xmath1rb ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) , pairing can be induced to occur at temperatures @xmath97 for dc - e field of about 3,000 ( kv / cm ) and 1,000 ( kv / cm ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this should represent a reasonable prospect to aim for within current experimental capabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the estimate of @xmath10 is based on the numbers for currently available cylindrical magnetic traps ( with @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are respectively the axial and radial frequencies ) , i.e. with the width of the trap ground state @xmath101 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi energy and the momentum are respectively @xmath102 and @xmath103 for a noninteracting fermi gas in these traps . </S>",
    "<S> the effective spatial density at the trap center is @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> although the required electric field is high for a dc - e configuration , such field strengths can be easily achieved with lasers ( e.g , co@xmath105 laser ) in a quasi - static situation @xcite .    in conclusion , we have proposed a bcs pairing scheme for atoms inside an external dc - e . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed detailed atomic calculations demonstrating the strong anisotropic pairing interactions for polarized atoms . by turning the p - wave scattering amplitude to larger values , </S>",
    "<S> we can effectively tune ( higher ) the critical temperature @xmath10 . compared with the existing proposals </S>",
    "<S> , our scheme seems to have several distinct advantages : first , the pairing only involves atoms in the maximum polarized state . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the same phase space density to be reached at a lower spatial density , thus lowering three - body decays . </S>",
    "<S> second , trapping inside the maximum polarized triplet hyperfine states completely eliminates the large ( usually dominant ) two - body decay mechanism : those due to spin exchange collisions . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , it suppresses the two - body dipolar decay processes since the final decay channels are more restricted . </S>",
    "<S> third , the applied dc - e provides a tuning knob for optimal experimental control . </S>",
    "<S> all indications seem to be consistent with our proposal at the moment . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore encourage experimentalists to attempt the implementation of the strong electric fields required . </S>",
    "<S> it may also become possible to utilize the low energy scattering resonances to induce dominant two - body attractions in d- , e- , and maybe even f - waves . </S>",
    "<S> if the fermionic gases can be confined in an optical dipole trap similar to those recently realized for bec at mit @xcite , one may be able to create more exotic bcs states such as those of the a- and b- phases in @xmath7he , but with richer spin structures @xcite .    </S>",
