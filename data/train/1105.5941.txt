    "atomistic processes such as the self - assembly of nano - particles and the growth of thin films have become extremely important for the development of new micro and nano devices and therefore have a huge potential in a vast number of disciplines  @xcite .",
    "understanding at the atomistic level the driving force for these processes is an essential aspect in order to direct future experimental research but present an enormous challenge to theory .",
    "the complexity of these processes are often too extensive for an exhaustive brute - force enumeration and would require an inaccessible amount of computational resources .",
    "heuristics have recently challenged conventional methods such as monte carlo for understanding complex processes at the atomistic level and particular promising approaches include evolutionary and genetic algorithms ( ga )  @xcite .",
    "powerful examples of the applications of atomistic ga are the prediction of crystal structures  @xcite and the geometry of nano - clusters  @xcite , reconstruction and structure of surfaces  @xcite , modeling grain boundaries  @xcite , spin glasses  @xcite and disordered bulk materials  @xcite .",
    "inspired by darwin s theory of evolution , key operators in the ga are `` selection '' and `` crossover '' . the problem of interest is usually reformulated such that a microstate is mapped on the form of a binary string .",
    "parents with high fitness ( i.e.  low energy ) are preferentially selected for ( selection ) , and offspring are formed by first cutting the parent strings at certain bit - positions and then combining complimentary strings of each parents ( crossover ) . alternatively the crossover can be made directly in real space ( using the original variables ) by combining ( often large ) `` clusters '' from each parents to form offspring(s )  @xcite .",
    "compared to that of uniform crossover ( i.e.  random bits are taken from each parents ) real space operators are more frequently used within the field of atomistic design since they have the advantage of preserving local order / structure .",
    "inspired by the success of ga in the fields mentioned above , we have recently developed  @xcite a novel genetic algorithm for finding configurations with target properties of substitutionally disordered materials ( crystalline materials where different atoms are distributed over a set of distinct sites ) such as alloys ( e.g.  aupt ) , ceramics ( e.g.  mgo - mno ) and minerals ( e.g.  pyrope - grossular mg@xmath0al@xmath1si@xmath0o@xmath2-ca@xmath0al@xmath1si@xmath0o@xmath2 ) .",
    "understanding local order within substitutionally disordered materials are important within a range of field such as the development of new alloys with superior mechanical and electrical properties and also for understanding geochemical processes within the earths interior .",
    "a generic high temperature binary `` ab '' alloy is visualised in fig .",
    "[ alloys]a where species `` a '' and `` b '' are distributed at random on the underlying lattice .",
    "problems of particular interest are whether these alloys at low temperature order ( see fig .",
    "[ alloys]b ) or phase - separate ( see fig .",
    "[ alloys]c ) , and if they order we would like to know how the atoms tend to arrange themselves .",
    "thus we are searching for configurations with the lowest energy , which in general is a hard problem and unit cells with more than 10@xmath3 atoms is typically required .",
    "for example , distributing 500 atoms of type `` a '' and 500 atoms of type `` b '' within a simulation box having 1000 lattice positions gives a total of @xmath4 distinct arrangements !",
    "although these problems are in principle suitable for ga , one of the major problems that hamper conventional ga to find global minima of alloys is the presence of a large number of symmetrically equivalent ( low energy ) configurations , which in general are far away from one - another in configuration space  @xcite .",
    "this can be examplified using a simple one - dimensional 100 atoms ising - alloy where nearest unlike neighbouring atoms repel one another and nearest like neighbouring atoms attract one another .",
    "we apply periodic boundary conditions such that the first atom in the string is bonded to the last atom in the string .",
    "this system has the symmetry of a 100-sided polygon and transforms according to the irreducible representations of the dihedral group , @xmath5 .",
    "there are 100 distinct ( symmetrically equivalent ) global minima , as for example :        ( here the grey circles stand for one type of atom and the black ones for the other type . )    despite the simplicity of this problem , a conventional ga fails to find one of the global minima even with huge initial populations , because the population does not contain sufficient diversity to `` differ '' between the building blocks of the low energy minima and the global minima .",
    "the high order building blocks ( i.e.  good local structures , also called schemata ) of a given global minimum are very similar to those present in a neighbouring low energy minima since the schemata of the global minimum and the neighbouring low energy minima all contain high order building blocks such as @xmath6@xmath7 , @xmath8@xmath9 located at the _ same _ bit positions . however , since the symmetrically equivalent global minima are often _ far away _ from one another in the configurational space , the crossing of two good minima will typically produce equally good or poorer solutions .",
    "as a consequence the driving force in the direction of a _ single _ global minimum is very weak and the algorithm is not able to find the optimal structure .",
    "the premature convergence is manifested as small ( local ) clusters of good solutions which can not recombine to form higher order building blocks of better solutions .",
    "this is visualised in fig .",
    "[ evolconv ] where we show two stages of a population of 30 members of the simple 1d ising model introduced above .",
    "one possibility to cure this problem is to introduce random mutations in the population pool .",
    "however , in that case the ga reduces to that of a random walk with no efficient crossover and thus becomes unsuitable for finding global minima for alloys in which other methods such as monte carlo algorithms perform better .",
    "we have recently shown  @xcite that this premature convergence can be avoided using a real - space _ symmetry adapted _ crossover ( sac ) by replacing the offspring with a randomly chosen symmetrically equivalent offspring ( they have the same fitness ! ) .",
    "for example , if the child looks like        we now apply a random translation operation of d@xmath10 by translating all atoms , for example 6 bits to the left .",
    "this translation operation creates the following symmetrically equivalent child        .",
    "this child , which has the same fitness as the original child , is now added to the population rather than the original child .",
    "the huge advantage of applying such symmetry - adapted mating operations is because it allows one to carry out large swaps in configuration space without destroying the schemata .",
    "this enables the building blocks of good solution to combine to form higher order building blocks of even better solutions .",
    "the evolution of the periodic 1d ising - alloy discussed above using symmetry adapted crossover is shown in fig .",
    "[ evolsac ]  @xcite . as can be seen , cluster of `` good '' solutions ( fig .",
    "[ evolsac ] after 300 generations ) are found at _ all _ regions in configurational space , providing a driving force in the direction of the global minima ( fig .",
    "[ evolsac ] after 1000 generations ) .    in the present work",
    "we demonstrate the performance of ga in conjunction with a symmetry adapted crossover applied to two 3d ising - type problems with nearest neighbour interactions , representing alloys that either order or phase separate at low temperature .",
    "these are important benchmark tests since the global minima are trivally known .",
    "an implementation of our ga for the study of disordered alloys is shown in fig .",
    "[ float ] .",
    "different symmetry adapted real - space crossover operations have been implemented for all cubic ( face centred , body centred and primitive ) , tetragonal ( body centred and primitive ) and orthorombic ( face - centred , singe face - centred , body - centred and primitive ) lattices . in addition , conventional binary operations such as two - point and uniform crossover are implemented but most attention has been given to different real space crossover operations . in this work",
    "we use periodic planar cuts which are carried out by choosing two random points r@xmath11 and r@xmath1 ( @xmath12 ) along a randomly chozen axis  @xmath13 .",
    "the child are formed by taking the atoms from parent 1 with  @xmath13  coordinates , @xmath14 and the complimentary atoms from parent 2 .",
    "we have also implemented real space crossover operations where various shaped `` clusters '' from one parent are inserted within the other parent .",
    "the energy we use for studying 3d ising alloys was originally introduced for the study of ferromagnetism in 1925 by ising  @xcite and is given by    @xmath15    here @xmath16 , are either @xmath17 if the atoms are of type `` a '' or @xmath18 if the atoms are of type `` b '' and @xmath19 is the interaction energy between the species . for simplicity",
    ", the summation is carried over the nearest neighbours only .",
    "if @xmath20 , bonds between unlike atoms contribute @xmath21 to the total energy and bonds between like pairs contribute @xmath22 to the total energy which promote a high degree of mixing between the difference species and the ground state is an alternating sequence of @xmath17 and @xmath18 spins / atoms . if @xmath23 , unlike atoms repel one - another promoting phase - separations at low temperature .",
    "the summation in equation  [ eq_ising ] is _ constrained _ to fix the overall composition during the evolution.in",
    "this work we investigate two such 3d ising alloys in which the atoms are distributed on a cubic lattice .    in all runs an intial population was selected at random .",
    "we apply a tournament selection , in which the candidates with the highest fitness ( lowest energy ) among two randomly chosen pairs are selected as parents .",
    "we use a steady state genetic algorithm in which at each generation one of the children replaces the worst fit member in the population .",
    "results from ga calculations of a primitive cubic periodic 1000-atoms ising alloy with @xmath24 and a fixed 50:50 composition of species a and b are shown in fig .",
    "[ prog1 ] .",
    "simulations were carried out both with and without the use of symmetry adapted crossover ( bold solid and dashed lines , respectively ) and a population size of 50 members .",
    "we also show results where a uniformed sac , described below , was used ( bold dotted line ) .",
    "100 independent runs were carried out , and the mean value of the best energies at each step is displayed in fig .",
    "[ prog1 ] .",
    "we also include two individual runs , marked as seed 1 and seed 2 ( thin lines ) using real space sac .",
    "note that the ground state has an energy of 3 times the number of atoms , i.e.  here 3000 .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the use of a real space symmetry - adapted crossover clearly outperforms the conventional ga which fails in all attempts to find the global minimum .",
    "even with huge population sizes ( @xmath25 members ) the conventional genetic algorithm is unable to find a global minimum .",
    "by contrast , we find that the use of sac in combintation with real space crossover is very robust even with small populations . in all 100 real space sac optimisations",
    "less than 15000 fitness evaluations were required to find the global minium .",
    "even population sizes consisting of only 10 members were sufficient in order to locate the global minima in _ all _ 100 simulations . on average , only 2000 steps were needed to find the global minima with a population size of 10 members , whereas 10000 steps were needed when the size of the population was 50 . in the former case the global minima",
    "were found in all simulations in less than 6000 steps whereas 96% were found in less than 3000 steps .",
    "these results are highly encouraging if one bears in mind the extreme large number of possible solutions .",
    "a uniformed crossover ( by taking random atoms from parent 1 and the complimentary set of atoms from parents two ) together with sac is also able to find the global minima , but the evolution is very slow as seen in fig .",
    "[ prog1 ] and more than @xmath26 steps are , on average , needed to find a global minimum .",
    "the slow convergence is easily explained because many bonds are broken when a uniformed crossover is used and potentially good building blocks are frequently destroyed .",
    "we have also carried out tests using simple mutations by , e.g. , exchanging a random pair of different atoms but , in fact , we found that the evolution is slowed down when mutations are applied .    in fig .",
    "[ prog2 ] we plot results for the case @xmath27 . for this value",
    "the configurations with the lowest energy is the one in which the atomic species are completely segregated , mimicking systems that phase separate at low temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ alloys]c .",
    "again , 1000 atoms were placed on a primitive cubic simulation box and a fixed 50:50 composition of species a and b was studied , and periodic boundary conditions were imposed ( i.e. the cubical simulation box is replicated throughout space to form an infinite lattic ) .",
    "simulations were carried out both with and without the use of symmetry adapted crossover and the population size was 1000 .",
    "100 independent runs were carried out , and the mean value of the best energies at each step is displayed in fig .",
    "[ prog2 ] along with the runs with two seeds . for this value of @xmath19 the ground state has an energy of -2600 .",
    "the superior performance of sac compared to that of using a conventional crossover is evident although comparison of the sac results from figs .",
    "[ prog1 ] and  [ prog2 ] shows that the evolution is markedly slower when @xmath27 .",
    "populations with more than 1000 individuals were required to find the global minima in 50% of the runs , and on average , 200 000 evolutionary steps were needed . to locate the global minimum with 96% probability large populations ( @xmath28 members ) must be used .",
    "the very different performance of the ga applied to the two ising models is not surprising : in the case @xmath24 there are only 2 distinct global minima , independent of system size , whereas for @xmath27 there are @xmath29 distinct solutions , where @xmath30 is the side length of the cube , i.e.  in our case there are 30 different solutions .",
    "a synchronized search towards one of the 2 global minima is thus much more rapid than a synchronized search in the direction of the @xmath29 global minima .",
    "one way to overcome this slow convergence may be via the use of pinning by e.g.  adding a energy penalty to a large number of global minima , i.e. to break translation symmetry and thereby forcing the evolution in the direction of only a few global minima .",
    "work along these lines is in progress  @xcite .",
    "we have developed a real - space symmetry adapted genetic algorithm for finding global minima configurations of alloys and disordered ceramics .",
    "the method is illustrated using two simple model - systems mimicking alloys that either phase separate or order at low temperature .",
    "conventional genetic algorithms are unable to solve these problems because the inherent space group symmetry prevents a constant driving force in the direction of a single global minimum .",
    "we avoid this synchronisation problem by incorporating the lattice symmetry of the system within the ga operators by means of replacing the child with a randomly chosen _ symmetrically equivalent _ child .",
    "use of symmetry adaption in combination with real - space crossover operator has the advantage of moving the local evolution of good `` clusters '' to other region in space where the evolution has halted , preventing premature convergence .",
    "the advantage of using a real - space crossover in conjunction with sac is evident by the comparison of results where a uniformed ( binary ) sac were applied .",
    "our results are highly encouraging for the atomistic understanding of more complex alloys and substitutionally disordered ceramics .",
