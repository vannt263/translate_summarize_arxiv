    "the study of the heavy ion ( hi ) collisions carried out by the experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl , and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , demonstrated that the hot and dense matter produced in the interactions of heavy nuclei at high energy imposes a significant energy loss on the energetic color charge carriers penetrating such a medium  @xcite .",
    "an understanding of this phenomenon requires measuring the initial production rates of the particles in hi collisions before they lose energy .",
    "the best candidates to perform such measurements are particles which do not interact via the strong force , such as @xmath1 , @xmath0 bosons and photons .",
    "the phenix experiment at rhic measured the properties of highly energetic photons  @xcite .",
    "the atlas and cms experiments at lhc provided the first measurements of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and photons at the lhc energy @xcite . due to the complexity of these measurements and limited statistics of the first lhc  run ,",
    "the results have relatively large uncertainties . within their uncertainties",
    "the measurements show that in hi collisions the production rates of particles at high momentum transfer are proportional to average nuclei thickness function ( ) , commonly expressed also as mean number of binary collisions , , between the nucleons of the colliding nuclei .",
    "these two parameters are related as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the total inelastic cross section of  interactions .",
    "the calculations of these parameters are carried out within the framework of the glauber model   @xcite .",
    "this proceeding presents the latest results from the atlas experiment at lhc on the measurement of @xmath1 , @xmath0 bosons and isolated photon production in  collisions at = 2.76 .",
    "the results measured in different centrality bins are compared to each other and also to predictions .",
    "the atlas detector  @xcite at the lhc covers nearly the entire solid angle around the collision point .",
    "it consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid , electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters , and a muon spectrometer incorporating three large superconducting toroid magnet systems .",
    "the inner - detector system ( i d ) is immersed in a 2  t axial magnetic field and provides charged particle tracking in the pseudorapidity range @xmath6-axis , while the positive @xmath7-axis is defined as pointing from the collision point to the center of the lhc ring and the positive @xmath8-axis points upwards .",

    "the analysis of @xmath1 bosons uses 2010 lhc  collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 5 .",
    "the analysis of isolated photons and @xmath0 bosons is based on the 2011 lhc  collision data and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately 0.15 .",
    "both data samples were obtained at the energy of = 2.76 .",
    "all selected events are required to satisfy the minimum bias ( mb ) event selection . all events in 2010 run were taken with the mb trigger , requiring the coincidence of the zdc signals on both sides , and the event vertex reconstructed offline . with increasing event rates in 2011 run , this condition was modified . on a trigger level",
    "the mb required transverse energy ( ) deposition of @xmath2250   in the atlas calorimeter or a coincidence of the zdc signals on both sides and a track in the i d system . in offline analysis",

    "`` centrality '' reflects the overlap volume of the two colliding nuclei , controlled by the impact parameter .",
    "that overlap volume is closely related to the average number of participants , , the nucleons which scatter inelastically in each nuclear collision and the number of binary collisions , , between the nucleons of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the   collision centrality is measured using the sum of transverse energy ( ) deposited in the forward calorimeter ( fcal ) over the pseudorapidity range @xmath26 calibrated at the electromagnetic energy scale  @xcite .",
    "the fraction of events with more than one collision in the 2010 run was negligibly small , and in the 2011 run it was estimated not to exceed 0.05% independent of centrality except for the very central collisions .",
    "a cut on the fcal energy of @xmath273.8   was applied to prevent pileup contamination in the analyzed data .",
    "measurement of the @xmath1 bosons is based on reconstruction of inclusive muon spectrum .",
