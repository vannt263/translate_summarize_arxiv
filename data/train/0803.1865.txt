    "an impressive convergence of recent astronomical observations are suggesting that our world behaves like a spatially flat scenario dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) plus an exotic component endowed with large negative pressure , usually named dark energy @xcite . in the framework of general relativity , besides the cosmological constant , there are several candidates for dark energy , among them : a vacuum decaying energy density , or a time varying @xmath3 @xcite , the so - called  x - matter \" @xcite , a relic scalar field @xcite , and a chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "some recent review articles discussing the history , interpretations , as well as , the major difficulties of such candidates have also been published in the last few years @xcite .    in the case of x - matter , for instance , the dark energy component is simply described by an equation of state @xmath4 .",
    "the case @xmath5 reduces to the cosmological constant , and together the cdm defines the scenario usually referred to as  cosmic concordance model \" ( @xmath6cdm ) .",
    "the imposition @xmath7 is physically motivated by the classical fluid description @xcite . however , as discussed by several authors , such an imposition introduces a strong bias in the parameter determination from observational data . in order to take into account this difficulty , superquintessence or phantom dark energy cosmologies",
    "have been recently considered where such a condition is relaxed @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the usual quintessence model , a decoupled phantom component presents an anomalous evolutionary behavior .",
    "for instance , the existence of future curvature singularities , a growth of the energy density with the expansion , or even the possibility of a rip - off of the structure of matter at all scales are theoretically expected ( @xcite for a thermodynamic discussion ) .",
    "although possessing such strange features , the phantom behavior is theoretically allowed by some kinetically scalar field driven cosmology @xcite , as well as , by brane world models @xcite , and , perhaps , more important to the present work , a phantomcdm cosmology provides a better fit to type ia supernovae observations than does the @xmath6cdm model @xcite .",
    "many others observational and theoretical properties phantom driven cosmologies ( more generally , of xcdm scenarios ) have been successfully confronted to standard results ( see , for instance @xcite ) .    in this context ,",
    "one of the most important tasks for cosmologists nowadays is to confront different cosmological scenarios driven by cold dark matter ( cdm ) plus a given dark energy candidate with the available observational data . as widely known , a key quantity for some cosmological tests is the angular distance - redshift relation , @xmath8 , which for a homogeneous and isotropic background , can readily be derived by using the einstein field equations for the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) geometry . from @xmath8",
    "one obtains the expression for the angular diameter @xmath9 which can be compared with the available data for different samples of astronomical objects @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the real universe is not perfectly homogeneous , with light beams experiencing mass inhomogeneities along their way .",
    "actually , from small to intermediate scales ( @xmath10mpc ) , there is a lot of structure in form of voids , clumps and clusters which is probed by the propagating light @xcite .",
    "since the perturbed metric is unknown , an interesting possibility to account for such an effect is to introduce the smoothness parameter @xmath2 which is a phenomenological representation of the magnification effects experienced by the light beam . from general grounds ,",
    "one expects a redshift dependence of @xmath2 since the degree of smoothness for the pressureless matter is supposed to be a time varying quantity @xcite . when @xmath11 ( filled beam ) , the homogeneous frw case is fully recovered ; @xmath12 stands for a defocusing effect while @xmath13 represents a totally clumped universe ( empty beam ) .",
    "the distance relation that takes these mass inhomogeneities into account was discussed by zeldovich @xcite followed by kantowski @xcite , although a clear - cut application for cosmology was given only in 1972 by dyer and roeder @xcite .",
    "later on , by considering a perturbed friedmannian model tomita @xcite performed n - body simulations with the cdm spectrum in order to determine the distribution for @xmath2 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a more general analysis involving distances in perturbed models ) .",
    "many references may also be found in the textbook by schneider , ehlers and falco , @xcite , as well as , in kantowski @xcite .",
    "many studies involving the zkdr distances in dark energy models have been published in the literature .",
    "analytical expressions for a general background in the empty beam approximation ( @xmath13 ) were derived by sereno _",
    "_ @xcite . by assuming that both dominant components may be clustered they also discussed",
    "how the critical redshift , i.e. , the value of @xmath14 for which @xmath8 is a maximum ( or @xmath15 minimum ) , and compared to the homogeneous background results as given by lima and alcaniz @xcite , and , further discussed by lewis and ibata @xcite , and arajo and stoeger @xcite .",
    "more recently , demianski _",
    "@xcite , derived an useful analytical approximate solution for a clumped concordance model ( @xmath6cdm ) valid on the interval @xmath16 .",
    "additional studies on this subject involving time delay ( lewis and ibata @xcite ; giovi and amendola @xcite ) , gravitational lensing ( kochanek ; kochanek and schechter @xcite ) or even accelerated models driven by particle creation have also been considered @xcite .",
    "although carefully investigated in many of their theoretical and observational aspects , an overview in the literature shows that a quantitative analysis on the influence of dark energy in connection with inhomogeneities present in the observed universe still remains to be studied . analytical expression for a general applied for the @xmath17 statistics with basis on a @xmath6cdm cosmology with constant @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it was concluded that the best fit model occurs at @xmath18 and @xmath19 whether the characteristic angular size @xmath20 of the compact radio sources is marginalized .",
    "more recently , the smoothness @xmath2 parameter was constrained through a statistical analysis involving supernovae ia data @xcite .",
    "a @xmath21-analysis based on the 182 sne ia data of riess _",
    "@xcite constrained the pair of parameters ( @xmath22 ) to be @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "such an analysis has also been carried out in the framework of a @xmath6cdm cosmology .    in this paper , we focus our attention on x - matter cosmologies with special emphasis to phantom models ( @xmath26 ) by taking into account the presence of a clustered cold dark matter .",
    "the mass inhomogeneities will be described by the zkdr distance characterized by a smoothness parameter @xmath27 which depends on a positive power index @xmath1 . the main objective is to provide a statistical analysis to angular size data from a large sample of milliarcsecond compact radio sources",
    "@xcite distributed over a wide range of redshifts ( @xmath28 ) whose distance is defined by the zkdr equation . as an extra bonus , it will be shown that a pure cdm model ( @xmath29 ) is not compatible with these data even for the empty beam approximation ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline the derivation of the zkdr equation for a x - cdm cosmology .",
    "we also provide some arguments ( see appendix ) for a locally nonhomogeneous universe where the homogeneous contribution of the dark matter obeys the relation @xmath30 where @xmath1 is a positive number , @xmath31 is the average matter density and @xmath32 its present value . in section 3",
    "we analyze the constraints on the free parameters @xmath2 and @xmath33 from angular size data .",
    "we end the paper by summarizing the main results in section 4 .",
    "let us now consider a flat frw geometry ( @xmath34 ) @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the scale factor .",
    "such a spacetime is supported by the pressureless cdm fluid plus a x - matter component of densities @xmath31 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "hence , the total energy momentum tensor , @xmath38 , can be written as @xmath39 u^{\\mu}u^{\\nu } - \\omega\\rho_{x } g^{\\mu\\nu},\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the hydrodynamics 4-velocity of the comoving volume elements . in this framework",
    ", the independent components of the einstein field equations ( efe ) @xmath41 take the following forms : @xmath42 , \\ ] ] @xmath43 , \\ ] ] where an overdot denotes derivative with respect to time and @xmath44 is the hubble parameter . by the flat condition , @xmath45 ,",
    "is the present day dark energy density parameter . as one may check from ( 2)-(5 ) , the case @xmath46 describes effectively the favored  cosmic concordance model \" ( @xmath6cdm ) .    on the other hand , in the framework of a comformally flat frw metric ,",
    "the optical scalar equation in the geometric optics approximation reads ( optical shear neglected ) @xcite    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the beam cross sectional area , plicas means derivative with respect to the affine parameter describing the null geodesics , and @xmath49 is a 4-vector tangent to the photon trajectory whose divergence determines the optical scalar expansion @xcite .",
    "the circular frequency of the light ray as seen by the observer with 4-velocity @xmath50 is @xmath51 , while the angular diameter distance , @xmath52 , is proportional to @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "as widely known , there is no an acceptable averaging procedure for smoothing out local inhomogeneities .",
    "after dyer and roeder @xcite , it is usual to introduce a phenomenological parameter , @xmath54 , called the  smoothness \" parameter . for each value of @xmath14 ,",
    "such a parameter quantifies the portion of matter in clumps ( @xmath55 ) relative to the amount of background matter which is uniformly distributed ( @xmath31 ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", such authors examined only the case for constant @xmath2 , however , the basic consequence of the structure formation process is that it must be a function of the redshift . combining equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) , after a straightforward but lengthy algebra one finds that the angular diameter distance , @xmath8 , obeys the following differential equation @xmath56 which satisfies the boundary conditions : @xmath57 the functions @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 in equation ( 7 ) read @xmath61 the smoothness parameter @xmath0 , appearing in the expression of @xmath60 , assumes the form below ( see appendix a for a detailed discussion ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath1 are constants .",
    "note that the fraction @xmath64 is the present day value of @xmath27 . in fig .",
    "1 we show the general behavior of @xmath0 for some selected values of @xmath63 and @xmath1 .    0.1 in    at this point , it is interesting to compare eq .",
    "( 7 ) together the subsidiary definitions ( 8)-(10 ) with other treatments appearing in the literature . for @xmath65 ( constant @xmath2 ) and @xmath66 ( @xmath6cdm )",
    "it reduces to eq .",
    "( 2 ) as given by alcaniz _",
    "in fact , for @xmath5 the function @xmath60 is given by @xmath67 .",
    "further , recalling the existence of a simple relation between the luminosity distance , and the angular - diameter distance ( from etherington principle @xcite , @xmath68 ) , it is easy to see that eq .",
    "( 3 ) of santos _",
    "et al_. @xcite is recovered .",
    "a more general expression for @xmath6cdm model ( by including the curvature term ) has been derived by demianski _",
    "_ @xcite . as one may check , for @xmath2 constant , by identifying @xmath69 , our eq .",
    "( 7 ) is exactly eq.(10 ) as presented by giovi and amendola @xcite in their time delay studies ( see also eq . ( 2 ) of sereno _ et al . _",
    "different from other approaches appearing in the literature ( see for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we stress that in this paper the @xmath2 parameter is always smaller than unity .",
    "in addition , the @xmath2 parameter may also depend on the direction along the line of sight ( for a discussion of such effects see linder @xcite , sereno _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , wang @xcite ) .",
    "let us now discuss the integration of the zkdr equation with emphasis in the so - called phantom dark energy model ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "in what follows , assuming that @xmath70 is a constant , we have applied for all graphics a simple runge - kutta scheme ( see , for instance , the rksuite package from www.netlib.org ) .    in figure 2",
    "one can see how the equation of state parameter , @xmath70 , affects the angular diameter distance . for fixed values of @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath65",
    ", all the distances increase with the redshift when @xmath70 diminishes and enters in the phantom regime ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "for comparison we have also plotted the case for @xmath6cdm cosmology ( @xmath74 ) .    0.1 in    in fig .",
    "3 we show the effect of the @xmath1 parameter on the angular diameter distance for a specific phantom cosmology with @xmath75 , as requested by some recent analyzes of supernovae data @xcite . for this plot",
    "we have considered @xmath76 .",
    "as shown in appendix a , @xmath77 , is the present ratio between the homogeneous ( @xmath78 ) and the clumped ( @xmath55 ) fractions .",
    "it was fixed in such a way that @xmath79 assumes the value @xmath80 . until redshifts of the order of 2",
    ", the distance grows for smaller values of @xmath1 , and after that , it decreases following nearly the same behavior .    in fig .",
    "4 we display the influence of the @xmath63 parameter on the angular diameter distance for two distinct sets of @xmath1 values . the cosmological framework is defined @xmath81 and the same equation of state parameter @xmath75 ( phantom cosmology ) . for each branch ( a subset of 3 curves with fixed @xmath1 )",
    "the distance increases for smaller values of @xmath63 , as should be expected .",
    "as we have seen , in order to apply the angular diameter distance to a more realistic description of the universe it is necessary to take into account local inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter .",
    "similarly , such a statement remains true for any cosmological test involving angular diameter distances , as for instance , measurements of angular size , @xmath17 , of distant objects .",
    "thus , instead of the standard frw homogeneous diameter distance one must consider the solutions of the zkdr equation .    0.1 in    0.1 in    here we are concerned with angular diameters of light sources described as rigid rods and not isophotal diameters . in the frw metric , the angular size of a light source of proper length @xmath82 ( assumed free of evolutionary effects ) and located at redshift @xmath14 can be written as @xmath83 where @xmath84h is the angular size scale expressed in milliarcsecond ( mas ) while @xmath82 is measured in parsecs for compact radio sources ( see below ) .",
    "let us now discuss the constraints from angular size measurements of high @xmath14 objects on the cosmological parameters .",
    "the present analysis is based on the angular size data for milliarcsecond compact radio sources compiled by gurvits _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite for applications to the unclustered frw case ) .",
    "this sample is composed by 145 sources at low and high redshifts ( @xmath28 ) distributed into 12 bins with 12 - 13 sources per bin ( for more details see gurvits _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in figure 5",
    "we show the binned data of the median angular size plotted as a function of redshift @xmath14 to the case with @xmath85 and some selected values of @xmath33 and @xmath86 = constant . as can be seen there , for a given value of @xmath33 the corresponding curve is slightly modified for different values of the smoothness parameter @xmath2 .",
    "now , in order to constrain the cosmic parameters , we first fix the central value of the hubble parameter obtained by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project @xmath87 @xmath88 ( freedman _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ) . nowadays ,",
    "this hst result has been confirmed by many different classes of estimators like the sunyaev - zeldovich effect and the ages of old high redshifts galaxies @xcite .",
    "this value is also in accordance with the 3 years release of the wmap team @xcite , however , it is greater than the recent determination by sandage and collaborators @xcite . following standard lines ,",
    "the confidence regions are constructed through a @xmath21 minimization @xmath89^{2}}{\\sigma_{i}^{2}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath90 , @xmath20 , @xmath70 , @xmath91 is defined from eq .",
    "( 7 ) and @xmath92 are the observed values of the angular size with errors @xmath93 of the @xmath94th bin in the sample .",
    "the confidence regions are defined by the conventional two - parameters @xmath21 levels . in this analysis , the intrinsic length @xmath20 ,",
    "is considered a kind of  nuisance \" parameter , and , as such , we have also marginalized over it .    0.1 in    0.1 in    0.1 in    in fig .",
    "6 we show confidence regions in the @xmath95 plane fixing @xmath96 , and assuming a gaussian prior on the @xmath70 parameter , i.e. , @xmath97 ( in order to accelerate the universe ) .",
    "the  @xmath98 \" indicates the best fit model that occurs at @xmath99 and @xmath100 .    in fig .",
    "7 the confidence regions are shown in the @xmath101 plane . we have now assumed a gaussian prior on @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath103 from the large scale structure . from figs . 6 and 7 , it is also perceptible that while the parameters @xmath70 and @xmath33 are strongly restricted , the entire interval of @xmath2 is still allowed .",
    "this shows the impossibility of tightly constraining the smoothness parameter @xmath2 with the current angular size data .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the one found by lima and alcaniz @xcite where the same data set were used to investigate constraints on quintessence scenarios in homogeneous background , and is also in line with the one obtained by barber et al .",
    "@xcite who argued in favor of @xmath104 near unity ( see also alcaniz , lima and silva @xcite for constraints on a clustered @xmath6cdm model ) .",
    "all cosmological distances must be notably modified whether the space - time is filled by a smooth dark energy component with negative pressure plus a clustered dark matter . here",
    "we have addressed the question of how the angular diameter distance of extragalactic objects are modified by assuming a slightly inhomogeneous universe .",
    "the present study complements our previous results @xcite by considering that the inhomogeneities can be described by the zeldovich - kantowski - dyer - roeder distance ( in this connection see also , giovi and amendola @xcite ; lewis and ibata @xcite ; sereno _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; demianski _ et al . _",
    "the dark energy component was described by the equation of state @xmath105 .",
    "a special emphasis was given to the case of phantom cosmology ( @xmath26 ) when the dominant energy condition is violated .",
    "the effects of the local clustered distribution of dark matter have been described by the  smoothness \" phenomenological parameter @xmath27 , and a simple argument for its functional redshift dependence was given in the appendix a ( see also figure 1 ) .",
    "the influence of the dark energy component was quantified by considering the angular diameters for sample of milliarcsecond radio sources ( fig .",
    "5 ) as described by gurvits _",
    "_ @xcite . by marginalizing over the characteristic angular size @xmath106 ,",
    "fixing @xmath107 , and assuming a gaussian prior on the eos parameter , i.e. , @xmath97 , the best fit model occurs at @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "this phantom model coincides with the central value recently determined by the supernova legacy survey ( astier _ et .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "fixing @xmath110 and assuming a gaussian prior for @xmath102 , that is , @xmath103 , we obtained the best fit values ( @xmath111 , @xmath109 ) .",
    "finally , in order to improve the present results , a statistical study is necessary for determining the intrinsic length of the compact radio sources .",
    "further , unlike to what happens with sne data @xcite , the angular diameter sample of compact radio sources of gurvits et al .",
    "@xcite does not provide useful constraints on the @xmath2 parameter ( see figs .",
    "naturally , these results reinforce the interest for measurements of angular size from compact radio sources at intermediary and high redshifts in order to constrain the @xmath2 parameter with basis on the zkdr distance .",
    "in this appendix we discuss the functional redshift dependence of the smoothness parameter , @xmath0 , adopted in this work . by definition @xmath112 where @xmath55 denotes the clumped fraction of the total matter density , @xmath31 , present in the considered frw type universe .",
    "this means that the ratio between the homogeneous ( @xmath78 ) and the clumped fraction can be written as @xmath113 $ ] .",
    "how this ratio depends on the redshift ? in this concern , we first remember that @xmath0 lies on the interval [ 0,1 ] . secondly , in virtue of the structure formation process , one expects that the degree of homogeneity must increase for higher redshifts , or equivalently , the clumped fraction should be asymptotically vanishing at early times , say , for @xmath114 .",
    "this means that @xmath115 at high z. on the other hand , @xmath2 must be zero for a completely clustered matter which is disproved at low redshifts by the data of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "it thus follows that at present ( @xmath116 ) , the related fraction assume an intermediate value , say , @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , it is also natural to suppose that the redshift dependence of the total matter density , @xmath31 , must play an important role in the evolution of their fractions . in this way , for the sake of generality",
    ", we will assume a power law @xmath117 where @xmath77 and @xmath1 are dimensionless numbers .",
    "finally , inserting @xmath118 , and solving for @xmath0 we obtain : @xmath119 which is the expression adopted in this work ( see eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) ) .",
    "as one may check , for positive values of @xmath1 , the smoothness function ( a3 ) has all the physically desirable properties above discussed .",
    "in particular , the limit for high values of @xmath14 does not depend on the values of @xmath63 and @xmath1 ( both of the order of unity ) .",
    "note also that if the clumped and homogeneous portions are contributing equally at present ( @xmath120 ) , we see that @xmath121 regardless of the value of @xmath1 .",
    "figure 1 display the general behavior of @xmath0 with the redshift for different choices of @xmath63 and @xmath1 .",
    "the above functional dependence should be compared with the other ones discussed in the literature ( see , for instance , @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "one of the most interesting features of ( a3 ) is that its validity is not restricted to a given redshift interval .",
