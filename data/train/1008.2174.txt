    "the process of magnetic field generation in a plasma is one of the most important problems for both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "several mechanisms of magnetic field generation have been analyzed that are effective in different plasma regimes . at high frequencies ,",
    "i.e. , on short electron time scales over which the ions can be assumed to be immobile and collisions are unimportant , the weibel instability can efficiently generate magnetic fields in plasmas with an anisotropic electron temperature distribution with zero real frequencies .",
    "the weibel instability is an electromagnetic plasma instability driven by the presence of temperature or electron momentum anisotropy  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the long time , kinetic , nonlinear evolution of the weibel instability in an electron - ion plasma by using vlasov - maxwell simulations in the 1d-2v phase space .",
    "relativistic effects on the plasma dynamics will be not considered , which become significant only for very high beam speeds .    the weibel instability developed due to the counter streaming of electrons",
    "have been studied and showed that other than the electromagnetic instability , there is also an electrostatic limit that corresponds to the well known two - stream instabilites . for more results we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "instead , we assumed temperature anisotropy to study weibel instability and will show , even in this case too , some kind of electrostatic instability develops due to acceleration of the particles .",
    "the weibel instability emerges from a wide white noise spectrum of wavelengths around the electron skin depth,@xmath0 .",
    "this length plays the role of the natural scale length for the instability and will be used in the following as the normalizing length .    in general ,",
    "since the growth rate of the weibel instability is comparable to the electron plasma frequency , and also the electromagnetic nature of the instability , this study of the weibel instability in the nonrelativistic limit has been limited so far to the electron dynamics .",
    "this approximation , which considers the ions as fixed neutralizing background , is valid during the linear and very early nonlinear phase of the instability . on the other hand , for longer times ,",
    "the ion response can not be neglected .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will introduce the governing equations and the initial conditions .",
    "the numerical simulations are presented in section iii .",
    "conclusions follow in section iv .",
    "the kinetic evolution of an electron - ion collisionless plasma is described by the vlasov equation in the phase space , coupled self - consistently to the maxwell equations .",
    "we have used 1d-2v @xmath1 phase space , with periodic boundary condition along @xmath2 direction , unidirectional magnetic field @xmath3 and a two - component electric field @xmath4 .",
    "the vlasov - maxwell equations are normalized by the following characteristic quantities : the electron mass @xmath5 , the characteristic electron density @xmath6 , the speed of light c , the electron plasma frequency @xmath7 , the electron skin depth @xmath8 and the characteristic fields @xmath9 . in dimensionless",
    "limits the vlasov - maxwell equations for electrons read as    @xmath10    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the 1d-2v electron distribution function ( edf ) . the poisson equation given by @xmath13 , where , @xmath14 is the potential and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are ion and electron density respectively .",
    "we integrate vlasov equation in the interval @xmath17 to have the total length of the box large enough to include the most unstable mode in the simulation .",
    "the initial dimensionless distribution function considered is :    @xmath18[1 + \\epsilon \\sum^{300}_{n=1}\\ \\cos(kx+\\phi(k))]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath19 is the length in the @xmath2 direction , @xmath20 is the thermal velocity of the electrons and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the temperatures along @xmath2 and @xmath23 direction respectively , the modes of the wave , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the perturbation amplitude . to include all the modes possible",
    "we choose 300 as the summation limit . at @xmath26",
    "we introduce also a perturbation on the magnetic field :    @xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath28 is the magnetic field amplitude and is independent of the mode .",
    "we have performed the numerical simulation(see ref .",
    "@xcite for the numerical algorithm ) of the weibel instability in plasma , by integrating numerically eqs.(1)-(2 ) with the initial conditions given by eqs.(3)-(4 ) .",
    "in particular , the electron and proton distribution function is advanced in time using the electromagnetic splitting method in the 1d-2v limit .",
    "the maxwell equation are integrated in time by using the third order adams - bashforth algorithm and standard fast fourier transform technique are applied to calculate the space derivatives .",
    "the temperature anisotropy considered is @xmath29 .",
    "we have performed the simulation with higher and lower temperature anisotropies also .",
    "but with lower temperature anisotropies the growth of the magnetic field is not strong enough to see the features we are interested in and also take longer time to run the simulation to reach the nonlinear regime .",
    "nothing interesting is found at higher temperature anisotropies too .",
    "hence , for the sake of qualitative agreement we assumed the particular case of anisotropy with @xmath29 .",
    "the thermal velocity is taken as @xmath30 , corresponding a plasma with a non - relativistic temperature .",
    "the perturbation amplitude for each wave is @xmath31 .",
    "initially , we consider a field free plasma , hence @xmath32 .",
    "the number of points in the @xmath2 and @xmath33 directions are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the time step is @xmath37 .",
    "the evolution of the system is investigated up to @xmath38 . the maximal velocity which defines the velocity interval",
    "is set to @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the @xmath2 and @xmath23 directions respectively such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the length of the space domain is @xmath43 .",
    "the space discretization in @xmath2 is @xmath44 , where @xmath0 is the electron skin depth .    in fig.1 (",
    "a ) we plot the fourier amplitudes of the magnetic field @xmath45 vs @xmath46 at @xmath47 .",
    "we see the modes in the interval @xmath48 have grown with a maximum growth rate corresponding to @xmath49 .",
    "note that a small portion of interval in @xmath46 is taken . in ( b )",
    "we plot the fourier amplitude of the magnetic field and of the @xmath2 and @xmath23 components of the electric field . in the linear phase , @xmath50",
    ", the magnetic field grows exponentially , corresponding to a growth rate @xmath51 . during this phase the fourier amplitudes of",
    "the electrostatic field @xmath52 remains negligible .",
    "however from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , the electrostatic field starts to grow at a very rapid rate , of the order of twice the linear growth rate of the instability , @xmath55(@xmath56 is the electrostatic growth rate ) , a clear signature of the beginning of the non linear regime . at later time , @xmath57 the magnetic field saturates .",
    "the electrostatic field levels off at @xmath57 due to particle trapping in phase space .",
    "in fig.2 we plot the electron distribution function(edf ) in @xmath58 space at time @xmath59 .",
    "frames in the first row show the edf at @xmath26 at the position where the magnetic field is maximum , zero and minimum .",
    "next rows show the same at different times . at @xmath60",
    "we can see that the velocity in the @xmath23 direction of the particles is greater than in the @xmath2 direction , corresponding to our initial condition where , in the @xmath23 direction the particles are hotter in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "a deformation of the edf is observed from @xmath57 .",
    "we see that there is a @xmath2-dependent rotation of the edf at the positions of maximum and minimum magnetic field at each time . on the contrary",
    "there is net acceleration of electrons in the direction of the electrostatic force at the position of zero magnetic field .",
    "we also observe that with increase in time additional structures in velocity space are formed elongated along @xmath61 .",
    "these additional structures in phase space may correspond to the particles that have been accelerated by the induced electric field and deflected by the magnetic field . to see further , we plot in fig.3 in frames ( a ) and ( b ) , the induced electric field vs time at @xmath62 and @xmath63 , positions corresponding to first and second zero s in the magnetic field .",
    "we see that the induced electric field at first zero is positive while for the next it is negative , which relates to the acceleration of the particles as mentioned earlier .",
    "same kind of distortions are observed in the corresponding contour plots in ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "as shown earlier , for @xmath54 the electrostatic field grows exponentially . in fig.4 , frames ( a)-(b)-(c )",
    "show the time evolution of the electron distribution function versus @xmath61 at fixed spatial position .",
    "we observe bumps along @xmath61 direction of the distribution function at @xmath64 .",
    "these bumps remain for quite a long time up to @xmath65 with a resonant velocity @xmath66 . in the last frame",
    "we show for corresponding k=25 the electrostatic field in time .",
    "we observe in the plot that indeed the electrostatic field grows in time during the period when we observe bumps in the edf .",
    "with the help of the numerical simulations , we have shown the kinetic saturation of the weibel instability .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the evolution of the weibel instability leads to distortions in the electron distribution function that give rise to the resonant onset of electrostatic field .",
