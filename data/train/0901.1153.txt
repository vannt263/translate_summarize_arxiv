    "a wormhole is a hypothetical object in general relativity which connects two or more asymptotic regions . in the history of wormhole research",
    ", the morris - thorne solution has occupied a central position as a typical static wormhole  @xcite , although many static wormhole metrics were obtained before that  @xcite .",
    "subsequent research revealed that wormholes may admit superluminal travel due to the global spacetime topology  @xcite and they may also lead to time machines  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that these intriguing static configurations require the violation of the null energy condition  @xcite . in the asymptotically flat case , this is also a consequence of the topological censorship  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "wormhole spacetimes can be constructed with arbitrarily small violation of the averaged null energy condition  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the wormhole configuration could be realized merely by quantum effects violating the energy conditions .",
    "dynamical wormholes are not as well understood as static wormholes .",
    "their comprehensive study was pioneered by hochberg and visser  @xcite and hayward  @xcite , who introduced two independent quasi - local definitions of a wormhole throat in a dynamical spacetime . in these definitions ,",
    "wormhole throats are trapping horizons  @xcite of various kinds , but the null energy condition must still be violated there .",
    "recently , we have numerically found an interesting one - parameter family of spherically symmetric dynamical wormhole solutions in an accelerating friedmann background  @xcite .",
    "the spacetime contains a perfect fluid and admits a homothetic killing vector .",
    "this requires the equation of state to be linear and the cosmic expansion is accelerating for an appropriate equation of state parameter .",
    "the wormhole solutions are asymptotically friedmann at one infinity and they have another infinity , which may also be asymptotically friedmann for a special value of the parameter which describes these solutions . in this case , the wormhole throat connects two friedmann universes .",
    "interestingly , in this class of dynamical wormhole spacetimes , the dominant energy condition is satisfied everywhere .",
    "in fact , the hochberg - visser and hayward conditions are avoided because the spacetimes are trapped everywhere and there is no trapping horizon .    in the hochberg - visser and hayward definitions ,",
    "a wormhole throat is a two - dimensional surface of nonvanishing minimal area on a null hypersurface .",
    "however , there is no past null infinity in our dynamical wormhole solutions because there exists an initial singularity .",
    "the wormhole throats are therefore not defined on a null hypersurface but on a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "this demonstrates that the hochberg - visser and hayward definitions miss an important class of dynamical wormhole spacetimes , namely _ cosmological wormholes _ which are asymptotically friedmann universe and start with a big - bang singularity .    in this paper",
    ", we define a wormhole quasi - locally in terms of a surface of nonvanishing minimal area on a _ spacelike _ hypersurface and compare its properties with those of the hochberg - visser or hayward wormhole .",
    "we also construct two analytic examples of cosmological wormholes .",
    "one corresponds to the numerical solution obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , but it contains a singular hypersurface which violates the null energy condition . the other is a smooth model involving a combination of a perfect fluid and a ghost scalar field but the total matter content still satisfies the dominant energy condition .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  ii ,",
    "basic equations are given . in section  iii , we present several possible quasi - local definitions of the wormhole throat for the static and dynamical cases and discuss the violation of the energy conditions . in section",
    "iv , we construct two analytic cosmological wormholes , one of which contains massive thin shells .",
    "section  v makes concluding remarks and discusses future prospects .",
    "for simplicity , we assume spherical symmetry throughout this paper .",
    "the metric signature convention is taken to be @xmath0 , with greek indices running over spacetime coordinates .",
    "we follow the notation of hayward  @xcite , in which the line element is written locally in double - null coordinates as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the function @xmath4 is defined such that the area of the metric sphere is @xmath5 and we put @xmath6 .",
    "the spacetime will be assumed time - orientable , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 being future - pointing .",
    "we denote @xmath7 and @xmath8 by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , these being the outgoing and ingoing null normal vectors , respectively .",
    "we use @xmath11 and @xmath12 as indices on the two - dimensional spacetime spanned by @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath13 as the associated covariant derivative .",
    "the misner - sharp mass @xmath14  @xcite is then given by @xmath15 where the area expansions along @xmath9 and @xmath10 are defined respectively as @xmath16 we assume @xmath17 , at least locally , as is always possible .",
    "the tangent vectors of the radial null geodesics @xmath18 are given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are functions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , and @xmath24 must be positive for @xmath18 to be future - pointing .",
    "the expansions of the null geodesics are given by @xmath25 where the semicolon denotes the covariant derivative associated with the four - dimensional metric @xmath26 .",
    "the notion of trapping horizons was introduced by hayward to give a quasi - local definition of black holes  @xcite .",
    "a metric sphere is said to be _ trapped _ if @xmath27 , _ untrapped _ if @xmath28 , and _ marginal _ if @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 has non - vanishing derivative , the spacetime is divided into trapped and untrapped regions , separated by marginal hypersurfaces .",
    "a marginal sphere is said to be _ future _ if @xmath31 , _ past _ if @xmath32 , and _ bifurcating _ if @xmath33 .",
    "a future marginal sphere is _ outer _",
    "if @xmath34 , _ inner _ if @xmath35 , and _ degenerate _ if @xmath36 . a past marginal sphere is _ outer _ if @xmath37 , _ inner _ if @xmath38 , and _ degenerate _ if @xmath39 .",
    "a _ trapping horizon _ is the closure of a hypersurface foliated by future or past , outer or inner marginal spheres  @xcite . from the definition of the misner - sharp mass",
    ", one can easily show that @xmath40 on trapping horizons .",
    "a _ future ( past ) outer trapping horizon _ is the closure of a hypersurface foliated by future ( past ) outer marginal spheres and this is the counterpart of a black hole ( white hole ) apparent horizon .",
    "accordingly , we call the closure of a hypersurface foliated by bifurcating marginal spheres a _ bifurcating trapping horizon_.    here we show that above definitions are equivalent even if we replace @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , where @xmath45 are the affine parameters of the null geodesics .",
    "we obtain @xmath46 thus we have @xmath47 on the hypersurface with @xmath33 , where we assume that the metric and @xmath24 are at least @xmath48 .",
    "it is therefore clear that the signs of @xmath43 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are the same as those of @xmath41 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the most general stress - energy tensor under spherical symmetry is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are functions of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the einstein equations then become @xmath60 the null energy condition for the matter field implies @xmath61 while the dominant energy condition implies @xmath62 the dominant energy condition assures that a causal observer measures non - negative energy density and that the energy flux is a future - directed causal vector .",
    "the dominant energy condition implies the null energy condition .",
    "in this section , we discuss several definitions of dynamical wormholes . although the concept of a wormhole is originally topological and global , it is possible to define it quasi - locally in terms of two - dimensional spheres of minimal area .",
    "first we revisit static wormholes and then consider the possible generalization to the dynamical case .",
    "staticity is defined by the existence of a timelike killing vector @xmath63 .",
    "we can write this as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the killing time coordinate",
    ". then we have @xmath66 there also exists another natural coordinate @xmath67 , corresponding to @xmath68 .",
    "we define a _ static wormhole _ as a timelike hypersurface foliated by minimal spheres on the constant @xmath69 spacelike hypersurfaces . at a minimal sphere , we have @xmath70 then , from eq .",
    "( [ throat - static ] ) with @xmath71 , we obtain @xmath72 there . we conclude that a wormhole throat in static spacetimes is a timelike bifurcating trapping horizon .    differentiating eq .",
    "( [ r - static ] ) with respect to @xmath58 and @xmath59 , we obtain @xmath73 equations  ( [ nullbasic1 ] ) and ( [ nullbasic2 ] ) , together with the condition @xmath72 , imply @xmath74 and @xmath75 on the wormhole throat .",
    "the minimality of the area then yields @xmath76 equations  ( [ ruu =- rvv ] ) and ( [ rxx ] ) imply @xmath77 and @xmath78 , so @xmath79 and @xmath80 at the wormhole throat from eqs .",
    "( [ ruu ] ) and ( [ rvv ] ) .",
    "therefore the null energy condition is violated at a wormhole throat in a static spacetime  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that all the definitions of dynamical wormholes will reduce to the standard one in the static case . in this sense , we are generalizing the notion of a static wormhole to the dynamical situation .",
    "hochberg and visser  @xcite and hayward  @xcite define a wormhole throat in terms of null expansions but in slightly different ways , which we now discuss .    in the spherically symmetric case , hochberg and visser",
    "@xcite define a wormhole throat by @xmath31 and @xmath81 or @xmath32 and @xmath82 .",
    "although the original definition allowed equality , we do not consider that case here .",
    "we thereby avoid the killing horizon in schwarzschild spacetime being a wormhole throat . on the other hand ,",
    "a hayward traversable wormhole throat is a _ timelike _ outer trapping horizon , i.e. , a timelike trapping horizon with @xmath31 and @xmath34 or @xmath32 and @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath83 be the timelike generator of the hayward wormhole throat with @xmath31 .",
    "then @xmath84 and , using @xmath85 and @xmath35 , we find @xmath86 .",
    "similarly , @xmath82 holds for the hayward wormhole throat with @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , a hayward wormhole throat is necessarily a hochberg - visser wormhole throat but the opposite does not hold in general .",
    "in fact , the hochberg - visser wormhole throat may be spacelike . in both cases ,",
    "@xmath81 or @xmath82 is satisfied on the wormhole throat , which means that it is a minimal sphere on null hypersurfaces .    with the hochberg - visser or hayward definition , the infinitesimal sectional area of the null geodesic congruence reaches a minimum at the wormhole throat . also",
    "both definitions of a wormhole throat are based on the physical intuition obtained from the asymptotically flat examples .",
    "however , in the cosmological situations this intuition may not apply because there is an initial singularity .",
    "we now show that the null energy condition is violated on the hochberg - visser and hayward wormhole throats .",
    "although we consider the @xmath87 case below , the argument also applies for @xmath32 . from eqs .",
    "( [ nullbasic2 ] ) and ( [ nullbasic3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath88 on the trapping horizon with @xmath31 .",
    "( [ mm3 ] ) then immediately implies the violation of the null energy condition for the hochberg - visser throat . since we have shown that a hayward throat is necessarily a hochberg - visser throat , the null energy condition is violated also for the hayward wormhole throat .",
    "it is important to investigate whether wormholes always need exotic matter fields which violate some energy condition . in these generalizations",
    "@xcite , the null energy condition must be violated at the wormhole throat , so the existence of traversable wormholes might seem implausible .",
    "however , as we will see , these definitions are not well - motivated in a cosmological background .",
    "we now present a definition of wormholes for spherically symmetric spacetimes which is relevant to the problems raised above . to accomplish this",
    ", we consider a spherically symmetric spacelike hypersurface and define a minimal sphere with @xmath89 on this hypersurface .",
    "this means @xmath90 where @xmath91 is any nonvanishing radial spacelike vector ( i.e. one with @xmath92 ) .",
    "it should be noted that any definition in terms of time - slicing will inevitably entail the problem of slice - dependence .",
    "here we note that @xmath93 could be an alternative definition to eq .",
    "( [ throat2 ] ) because the left - hand side gives the second order derivative along @xmath91",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the definition ( [ throat2 ] ) does not involve the derivative of @xmath94 . actually , @xmath93 is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ throat2 ] ) if @xmath91 is tangent to a geodesic .",
    "we say that a timelike hypersurface is a wormhole throat if it is foliated by minimal spheres on a spacelike hypersurface of the time - slicing .",
    "this reduces to the definition of a static wormhole for static spacetimes if we take the constant killing time hypersurface . for general dynamical spacetimes , eq .",
    "( [ throat1 ] ) gives either @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "( [ sign2 ] ) implies @xmath97 because @xmath98 .",
    "hence we conclude that a wormhole throat is either a trapped sphere or a bifurcating trapping horizon .",
    "this means that there are two classes of wormhole throats .",
    "the first is `` locally and momentarily static '' in the sense that it is a bifurcating trapping horizon .",
    "the second excludes a bifurcating trapping horizon and hence can not be a static wormhole . by the mean value theorem ,",
    "there then exists at least one trapping horizon if the spacetime admits a wormhole throat and if @xmath28 holds at spacelike infinity ( as in the asymptotically flat spacetime ) .",
    "although both hayward s and hochberg and visser s wormholes have a minimal sphere on the null hypersurface , we can make this hypersurface spacelike by an infinitesimally small deformation",
    ". therefore if either of their wormhole exists , then so does ours , i.e. , our wormhole definition generalizes theirs .",
    "it is interesting to examine the implication of our wormhole definition for the energy conditions .",
    "one can easily show that the null energy condition is violated on our wormhole throat being a bifurcating trapping horizon .",
    "the proof is essentially the same as for the static case . on the other hand",
    ", there may be no violation of the energy conditions on a wormhole which is a trapped sphere .",
    "this means that wormhole throats defined in terms of spacelike hypersurfaces would be much more plausible than those defined in terms of null hypersurfaces .",
    "here we should comment on the traversability of our wormhole solutions .",
    "hayward defined a wormhole throat as a temporal ( or timelike ) trapping horizon .",
    "by contrast , our wormhole definition does not depend on the existence of a temporal trapping horizon .",
    "for example , the maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime does not contain a wormhole throat in the sense of hochberg - visser or hayward but it does contain one in our sense and it is located inside the horizon  @xcite . intuitively , hayward s definition of a wormhole throat enables an observer to travel from one infinity to the other in an asymptotically flat spacetime . in a cosmological spacetime , however , there is generally no past infinity because of the initial singularity , so hayward s concept of a traversable wormhole might not be suitable .",
    "that is why we have adopted an alternative wormhole definition .",
    "in the last section , we have introduced a new quasi - local definition of a wormhole throat on a spacelike hypersurface and shown that such a throat must coincide with a bifurcating trapping horizon or be located in the trapped region .",
    "this implies that one can have a wormhole throat in the latter case even if there is no trapping horizon in the spacetime .",
    "recently , we have found an interesting one - parameter family of numerical spherically symmetric dynamical wormhole solutions of this kind  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we review these and give two analytic solutions for a wormhole connecting two different friedmann universes , one of which contains a massive thin shell .",
    "our new class of wormhole solutions are `` cosmological '' in the sense that one of the asymptotic regions is friedmann  @xcite .",
    "they are spherically symmetric and self - similar and contain a perfect fluid with equation of state of the form @xmath99 with @xmath100 ( dubbed `` dark energy '' ) .",
    "this matter model violates the strong energy condition but still satisfies the dominant energy condition .",
    "these solutions are a subset of the complete family of asymptotically friedmann spherically symmetric self - similar solutions with dark energy and are obtained by using the formulation and asymptotic analyses presented in ref .",
    "the most interesting wormhole solutions are of two types .",
    "the first connects two friedmann universes ; the second connects a friedmann universe and a quasi - friedmann universe ( in the sense that there is an angle deficit at large distances ) .",
    "the causal structure of these solutions is shown in fig .",

    "the wormhole throat connects two friedmann universes .",
    "nevertheless , the whole spacetime is trapped and there is no trapping horizon , so these spacetimes are not hochberg - visser or hayward wormholes .    this has led us to define a wormhole throat on a spacelike hypersurface , since this includes our new interesting class of _ cosmological wormholes_. we have shown that that dynamical wormhole throat may be located in the trapped region .",

    "the matter on the shell necessarily has a negative energy density for @xmath228 , but the solution is still interesting because it provides a simple analytic model for a cosmological wormhole which is not in the hochberg - visser or hayward class .",
    "we have also constructed an analytic solution for cosmological wormholes without a massive thin shell .",
    "this solution contains a ghost scalar field and a perfect fluid .",
