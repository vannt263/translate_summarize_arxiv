    "one of the principal goal of cosmological models is the description of the different phases of the universe . in doing so researchers use different types of sources from perfect fluid to dark energy . in recent time",
    "many authors have studied the evolution of the universe where the source is given by a nonlinear spinor field @xcite . in those papers",
    "it was shown that a suitable choice of nonlinearity ( i ) accelerates the isotropization process , ( ii ) gives rise to a singularity - free universe and ( iii ) generates late time acceleration .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite the authors have simulated perfect fluid using spinor field with different nonlinearity . that paper was followed by one @xcite , where perfect fluid and dark energy were modeled by nonlinear spinor field . in doing",
    "so we used two types of nonlinearity , one occurs as a result of self - action and the other resulted from the interaction between the spinor and scalar field .",
    "it was shown that the case with induced nonlinearity is the partial one and can be derived from the case with self - action .",
    "so , in this paper we stick to the case with self - action . here",
    "we repeat some of the previous results , give the description of generalized chaplygin gas and modified quintessence @xcite in terms of spinor field and study the evolution of the universe filled with nonlinear spinor field within the scope of a bianchi type - i cosmological model .",
    "first of all let us note that one of the simplest and popular model of the universe is a homogeneous and isotropic one filled with a perfect fluid with the energy density @xmath0 and pressure @xmath1 obeying the barotropic equation of state @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a constant .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath3 describes perfect fluid from phantom to ekpyrotic matter , namely    [ zeta ] @xmath4    in order to describe the matter given by with a spinor field let us now write the corresponding lagrangian @xcite : @xmath5 - m{\\bar \\psi}\\psi + f , \\label{lspin}\\ ] ] where the nonlinear term @xmath6 describes the self - action of a spinor field and can be presented as some arbitrary functions of invariant generated from the real bilinear forms of a spinor field . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case when @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "we consider the case when the spinor field depends on @xmath9 only . in this case for the components of energy - momentum tensor we find    @xmath10    inserting @xmath0 and @xmath11 into we find    @xmath12    with the solution @xmath13 with @xmath14 being an integration constant .",
    "inserting into we find that @xmath15 since energy density should be non - negative , we conclude that @xmath14 is a negative constant , i.e. , @xmath16 , with @xmath17 being a positive constant .",
    "so finally we can write the components of the energy momentum tensor    @xmath18    as one sees , the energy density @xmath0 is always positive , while the pressure @xmath19 is positive for @xmath20 , i.e. , for usual fluid and negative for @xmath21 , i.e. for dark energy .    in account of it",
    "the spinor field lagrangian now reads @xmath5 - \\nu s^{1+w } , \\label{lspin1}\\ ] ] thus a massless spinor field with the lagrangian describes perfect fluid from phantom to ekpyrotic matter . here",
    "the constant of integration @xmath17 can be viewed as constant of self - coupling .",
    "a detailed analysis of this study was given in @xcite .",
    "let us now generate a chaplygin gas by means of a spinor field .",
    "a chaplygin gas is usually described by a equation of state @xmath22 then in case of a massless spinor field for @xmath6 one finds @xmath23 with the solution @xmath24 on account of this for the components of energy momentum tensor we find    @xmath25    as was expected , we again get positive energy density and negative pressure .",
    "thus the spinor field lagrangian corresponding to a chaplygin gas reads @xmath5 - \\bigl(a + \\lambda s^{1+\\gamma}\\bigr)^{1/(1+\\gamma)}. \\label{lspin2}\\ ] ] setting @xmath26 we find the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "finally , we simulate modified quintessence with a nonlinear spinor field .",
    "it should be noted that one of the problems that face models with dark energy is that of eternal acceleration . in order",
    "to get rid of that problem quintessence with a modified equation of state was proposed which is given by @xcite @xmath27 here @xmath28 some critical energy density .",
    "setting @xmath29 one obtains ordinary quintessence .",
    "it is well known that as the universe expands the ( dark ) energy density decreases . as a result ,",
    "being a linear negative function of energy density , the corresponding pressure begins to increase . in case of an ordinary quintessence",
    "the pressure is always negative , but for a modified quintessence as soon as @xmath30 becomes less than the critical one , the pressure becomes positive .    inserting @xmath0 and @xmath11 into we find @xmath31 with @xmath32 being a positive constant . on account of this for the components of energy momentum tensor",
    "we find    @xmath33    we see that a nonlinear spinor field with specific type of nonlinearity can substitute perfect fluid and dark energy , thus give rise to a variety of evolution scenario of the universe .",
    "in the previous two sections we showed that the perfect fluid and the dark energy can be simulated by a nonlinear spinor field . in the section ii",
    "the nonlinearity was the subject to self - action , while in section iii the nonlinearity was induced by a scalar field .",
    "it was also shown the in our context the results of section iii is some special cases those of section ii . taking it into mind we study the evolution an anisotropic universe filled with a nonlinear spinor field given by the lagrangian , with the nonlinear term @xmath6 is given by of .",
    "we consider the anisotropic universe given by the bianchi type - i ( bi ) space - time @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the functions of @xmath9 only . from the spinor field equation",
    ", it can be shown that @xcite @xmath36 where we define @xmath37 for the components of the spinor field we obtain @xmath38 where @xmath39 . solving the einstein equation for the metric functions one find @xcite @xmath40 with the constants @xmath41 and",
    "@xmath42 obeying @xmath43 thus the components of the spinor field and metric functions are expressed in terms of @xmath44 . from the einstein equations one finds the equation for @xmath44 @xcite @xmath45 in case of on account of eq .",
