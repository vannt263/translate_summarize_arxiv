    "the @xmath2cdm model is the simplest model that best fits the supernovae luminosity distance and cmb anisotropy spectrum data @xcite . though it looks a very serious candidate it raises two main theoretical problems .",
    "first , it assumes the energy density of the vacuum but according to quantum field theory it should be larger than observed by @xmath3 orders of magnitude .",
    "secondly , there is the coincidence problem , namely : _ why the energy densities of matter and dark energy -scaling so differently with expansion- happen to be of the same order precisely today ? _ to solve the latter problem models featuring an interaction between quintessence and cold dark matter has been proposed @xcite .",
    "to account for the coincidence problem zimdahl et al .",
    "@xcite postulated an interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy ( a quintessence scalar field ) .",
    "+ @xmath4 + this brings the ratio between their energy densities , @xmath5 , to a stable constant value at late times .",
    "the interaction term , @xmath6 , may depend on @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "a simple ansatz is @xmath10 , where the constant @xmath11 is the interaction parameter . from eqs .",
    "( [ cont_eqs ] ) the aforesaid ratio is constrained to evolve between two stationary values , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the unstable value and @xmath14 the stable one -see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] the stronger the interaction , the smaller @xmath9 in the past .",
    "obviously , such a dissimilar evolution of @xmath9 as compared to the @xmath2cdm model , gives rise to a different expansion rate and a different evolution of the metric perturbations .",
    "the former modifies the luminosity distance of snia .",
    "the latter should be observed in the cmb anisotropy spectrum .",
    "below we constrain the iq model with the snia data of riess et al . @xcite and the cmb anisotropy data collected by the wmap satellite @xcite . +     from an unstable maximum towards a stable minimum ( at late times ) for different values of @xmath11 . as current value",

    "the cdm redshift is smaller than in the @xmath2cdm model , therefore a higher value of @xmath30 is needed to have enough gravitational potential at matter - radiation decoupling . moreover , in order not to alter the height of the acoustic peaks the @xmath31 value increases .",
    "otherwise , the small mean value of @xmath32 would suppress them .",
    "the likelihood shows clearly that the interaction parameter @xmath11 is compatible with the wmap data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : like2d ] ) . nevertheless , non - interacting models are also allowed , unless the amplitude , @xmath33 , is not a parameter ( see ref .",
    "thus , @xmath11 is bounded from above . at @xmath29 confidence level @xmath34 . the spectral tilt , @xmath35 , and the amplitude of the perturbations at the horizon size , @xmath33 , are in perfect agreement with those of the wmap team @xcite .",
    "we have presented an interacting cosmological model that solves the coincidence problem . despite the seemingly odd results of tab .",
    "[ tab : a ] it is in perfect agreement with snia data @xcite and cmb data @xcite .",
    "moreover , the lack of power at the lower multipoles becomes a less serious problem .",
    "indeed , because of the smaller redshift evolution of cdm energy density the gravitational potential evolves slower than in the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "thus , a smaller integrated sachs - wolfe effect produces less power in the cmb anisotropy spectrum . a next generation of accurate measurements of the hubble parameter and the dark energy density , independent of the cmb data ,",
