    "[ intro_sec ] a frequently found motif in biological networks , in particular in genetic networks , is the combination of a positive feedback loop in which one species ( @xmath0 ) activates itself , and a negative feedback loop , in which the first species activates its own repressor , the second species ( @xmath1 ) . in connection with genetic systems",
    "such motifs are realized in the camp signalling system in the slime mold dictyosthelium discoideum @xcite , in the embryonic division control system @xcite , the mapk - cascade @xcite , or in the circadian clock @xcite . from the viewpoint of theoretical physics one",
    "is interested in dynamical features that are in common to the many different dynamical realizations of this motif .",
    "one common feature is certainly the occurrence of regular oscillations and the possibility of excitable behavior for an appropriate choice of parameters , and these features are captured already by a deterministic description in form of the bistable frustrated unit , considered in @xcite and references therein",
    ". it should be emphasized , however , that the different realizations do not only differ by the biological systems in which they are realized , but also by the degree in which this representation as two coupled loops as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]    , activating also its own repressor @xmath1 . pointed arrows denote activation , blunt arrow denotes repression.,width=264 ]    amounts only to an effective description .",
    "the effective description should be seen in contrast to a one - to - one mapping of the participating ingredients . in principle",
    "a number of intermediate steps may be included in these loops , and these intermediate steps need not be on the same level in case of a hierarchical organization .",
    "they could amount to reactions between genes leading to production rates on the level of proteins , or on the same level , just to reactions between proteins , and it may make a big difference if protein @xmath0 is repressed via the binding of a transcription factor of type @xmath1 to gene @xmath2 ( design i ) , or via a direct repression of protein @xmath0 via @xmath1 ( design ii ) , as it was emphasized in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the distinct set of equations , corresponding to the two designs , lead to different oscillatory features and different behavior with respect to noise and external periodic signals , so that the motif in the first design acts as an  integrator \" of external stimuli , in the second design as a  resonator \" .    for a coarse - grained description that should reflect the essential dynamical implications of this motif",
    ", the question therefore arises when it is actually justified to subsume the intermediate steps to effectively effective single steps and to represent the whole system by a set of two ordinary differential equations for the concentrations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in particular such a description implies some kind of large - volume limit , in which the stochastic fluctuations of demographic origin , that is in the number of individuals , are ignored .",
    "in @xcite we have analyzed the effect of demographic fluctuations and of fluctuations in the reaction times in simple realizations of this motif , that is , without any intermediate steps .",
    "the stochastic fluctuations in the number of reactants and in the reaction times led to the occurrence of so - called quasi - cycles in parameter regimes for which the system would be deeply in the fixed - point regimes in the deterministic limit . on the other hand , the three regimes of the deterministic limit could be clearly recognized : as function of one bifurcation parameter @xmath3 , the maximal rate of production of @xmath0 for full activation and no repression , the dynamics of the coupled species @xmath0 and @xmath1 converges to a fixed point and shows excitable behavior in a first phase . in a second phase , regular limit - cycle behavior is observed , and in a third phase , again a fixed point with excitable behavior is seen . the quasi - cycles which are only due to the finite system size ,",
    "are more regular in the transition regions than far off in the fixed point phases , they can be distinguished from regular oscillations by the decay of their autocorrelation functions .",
    "when this motif is supposed to describe a genetic circuit , a possible zoom into the dynamical details would amount to a description in terms of proteins @xmath0 and @xmath1 , their associated mrna at an intermediate level and two types of genes a and b , respectively .",
    "protein production of type @xmath0 would result from transcription factors of type @xmath0 , activating gene @xmath4 which is transcribed to the corresponding mrna that leads to the translation to proteins @xmath0 . at the same time",
    ", protein @xmath0 leads to an activation of gene @xmath2 via binding of the transcription factor @xmath0 to gene @xmath2 , which is then transcribed to mrna of type @xmath2 , and when translated to proteins leads to a repression of the production of @xmath0 . in general , such intermediate steps as",
    "the production of mrna and the binding and unbinding of transcription factors to the promoter region of genes induce additional time scales : delay of the protein production , and the switching rate between gene states . here",
    "we distinguish the following gene states : states with bound activating transcription factor ( the gene being in the  on - state \" ) , states with bound repressing transcription factor ( the gene being in the  off - state \" ) , or no transcription factor bound ( which we call the gene being in the  bare - state \" ) . in principle",
    "we could consider further situations such as the simultaneous binding of an activator and a repressor to the promoter region of the gene @xmath4 , but we leave out this option for simplicity . whether the delay time and the switching rate can be ignored compared to the time scales defined by the protein decay rates of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is a matter of relative size . in addition , the excitable behavior with large excursions in phase space of the original motif is related to the pronounced difference in the decay times of the proteins : @xmath0 is considered as the fast variable and @xmath1 as the slow variable , similarly to the distinction of fast and slow variables in a fitzhugh - nagumo element @xcite .",
    "( due to this inherent difference , the oscillations become more spiky , the excursions in phase space from a fixed point more pronounced , and the description more realistic if we think of neurons realizing these circuits . )",
    "therefore , when comparing the switching rate of gene states , we should specify with respect to which decay rate ( that of @xmath0 or of @xmath1 ) it is fast or slow . in the following we call the switching rates  fast \" if they are fast in comparison to both decay rates , of @xmath0 and of @xmath1 ,  slow \" if the switching rate is of the order of the fast decay rate of @xmath0 , and  ultra - slow \" if it is of the order of the slow decay rate of @xmath1 .    in former related studies of this genetic circuit",
    "@xcite the switching rates of genes were assumed to be so high that their effect could be assumed to average out in the sense that mrna and proteins see only average values of gene activation or repression . in this paper",
    "we want to analyze the effect that the inherent time scale of binding and unbinding rates of transcription factors has on the coarse - grained modeling . in order to project on this effect ,",
    "we neglect the intermediate step of mrna production , but vary the binding / unbinding rates to values which are no longer high , but of the same order as the decay times of either the  fast \" protein @xmath0 or of the  slow \" protein @xmath1 .    from results for genetic switches ,",
    "in particular for the toggle switch @xcite , a simpler system than ours with only two mutually repressing genes , it is known that additional fixed points may show up for ( what we call ) slow genes .",
    "more precisely , the joint probability distribution of the number of proteins in the cell and the dna - binding site state ( being on or off ) have additional peaks , corresponding to additional fixed points in the deterministic limit , if the switches are studied in the nonadiabatic limit .",
    "if the switching rate between the genes is slow enough , the remainder of the system can follow the corresponding gene state of being either on or off .",
    "the dynamics of our system is more versatile .",
    "in addition to the fixed - point regime in the deterministic limit , we have the regime of regular limit - cycles , and the decay time of proteins differs by a factor of the order of hundred .",
    "so independently of the possibility to realize our system in synthetic genetic circuits or to find it in natural systems , we want to focus on the impact of  slow \" and  ultra - slow \" components on the system s dynamics , in particular on the phase structure .",
    "we start from a fully stochastic description in terms of master equations describing reactions directly between genes and proteins , skipping the intermediate mrna - production steps .",
    "we simulate these equations via the gillespie algorithm @xcite . in view of a coarse - grained description in the form of deterministic equations",
    "we take appropriate averages of the master equations which are adapted to the various limiting cases .",
    "these averaging procedures correspond to taking the zeroth order of a van kampen expansion @xcite of the master equations , where the expansion parameter is the inverse system size .",
    "the phase structure then differs for the resulting sets of deterministic equations , it depends on the competing time scales of genes and proteins . for fast genes",
    "we recover the previously observed structure of three regimes , two fixed - point and one limit - cycle regime .",
    "for this case we provide a detailed bifurcation analysis . for slow and ultra - slow genes ,",
    "the regime of regular limit cycles is absent .",
    "instead , the fast proteins @xmath0 see ( certain combinations of ) distinct states of gene expression separately rather than their averages : in the deterministic limit they therefore approach the fixed points corresponding to these states and stay there , unless the gene states change ; in the stochastic realization they switch between these states , so that the probability density to find @xmath5 proteins of type @xmath0 and @xmath6 proteins of type @xmath1 shows as many peaks as there are gene states distinguished .",
    "in contrast , the inherent dynamics of the proteins @xmath1 is still so slow that these proteins can not reach the vicinity of these fixed points in the stochastic realization which they would approach in the deterministic description , leading to broad peaks or almost uniform probability densities .",
    "the subsequent sections of the paper are organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ secii ] we present the model of interacting genes and proteins for the motif of a positive self - activating feedback loop coupled to a negative feedback loop with a second species repressing the first one .",
    "the model is described in terms of chemical reactions and master equations . in sect .",
    "[ seciii ] we derive deterministic models along with a stability analysis and a comparison with gillespie simulations for three limiting cases : fast genes ( sect .  [ seciii1 ] ) , slow genes ( sect .",

    "[ seciii3 ] ) . the summary and conclusions are given in sect .",
    "[ seciv ] , followed by an appendix in which we analyze in detail the two transition regions between fixed - point behavior and limit cycles .",
    "in terms of biochemical reactions we consider the following realization of the motif of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .     with a realization via genes",

    "the system size is parameterized by a factor @xmath16 . for protein",

(",

    "we leave out a further possible situation that an activating and a repressing transcription factor @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , are simultaneously bound to the respective promoter regions of gene @xmath4 , leading to a conflicting input of activation and repression .    since protein @xmath1 is only activated , but not repressed via @xmath0 , we distinguish here only two states : ( i ) an activating transcription factor @xmath0 is bound to the promoter region of gene @xmath2 , leading to a production of @xmath1 with rate @xmath21 , or , ( ii ) no transcription factor is bound , leading to a production rate of @xmath22 of protein @xmath1 .",

    "choosing @xmath15 much smaller than @xmath14 and @xmath23 much smaller than @xmath24 is a way to implement the different inherent time scales in the protein dynamics : that of @xmath0 is much faster than that of @xmath1 , the reason for why we call @xmath0 the fast variable and @xmath1 the slow variable also in this realization of the motif",

    "the reactions referring to production and decay of proteins are summarized in the following equations : @xmath27    next we come to the binding / unbinding reactions of transcription factors to the promoter region of genes .",

    "the production rates of the protein @xmath1 are also kept fixed and chosen by two orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding production rates of protein @xmath0 to compensate for the hundred times longer lifetime of protein @xmath1 in the competing gain and loss terms in eq .",

    "we derived deterministic equations equivalent to the former ones of @xcite .",
    "as soon as the binding / unbinding rates are no longer small , but of the same order as the decay time of either proteins , the averaging procedure for deriving a deterministic limit has to be changed ; the proteins see no longer average values of the gene states , but tend to follow the distinct states , unless their own production is too slow to reach the appropriate state  in time \" .",

    "for the ultra - slow genes they were also visible in the derived coarse - grained description in terms of five deterministic equations . for the intermediate case of binding rates of the order of the decay of the fast protein ,",
    "the intrinsic difficulty to derive deterministic equations lies in the fact that one and the same binding and unbinding events are differently seen from the proteins : protein @xmath0 sees already distinct events and follows the according gene state , protein @xmath1 still sees an average over the gene states . in both cases , slow and ultra - slow genes ,",
