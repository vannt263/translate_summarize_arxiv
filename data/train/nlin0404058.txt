    "knowing whether the orbits of a dynamical system are ordered or chaotic is fundamental for the understanding of the behavior of the system . in the dissipative case ,",
    "this distinction is easily made as both types of motion are attracting . in conservative systems , however , distinguishing between order and chaos is often a delicate issue ( e.g.  when the chaotic or ordered regions are small ) especially in systems with many degrees of freedom where one can not easily visualize the dynamics .",
    "for this reason it is of great importance to have quantities that determine if an orbit is ordered or chaotic , independent of the dimension of its phase space .",
    "the well  known and commonly used method for this purpose is the evaluation of the maximal lyapunov characteristic exponent ( lce ) @xmath0 . if @xmath3 the orbit is chaotic .",
    "benettin et al .",
    "@xcite studied theoretically the problem of the computation of all lces and proposed in @xcite an algorithm for their numerical computation .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 is computed as the limit for @xmath4 of the quantity @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are deviation vectors from a given orbit , at times @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath10 is given by solving the so  called _ variational equations _",
    "( see sec .",
    "[ behavior ] ) . generally , for almost all choices of initial deviations @xmath6 , the limit for @xmath4 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lyap ] ) gives the same @xmath0 .    in practice , of course ,",
    "since the exponential growth of @xmath7 occurs for short time intervals , one stops the evolution of @xmath7 after some time @xmath11 , records the computed @xmath12 , normalize vector @xmath7 and repeats the calculation for another time interval @xmath13 , etc . obtaining finally @xmath0 as an average over many @xmath14 , @xmath15 as @xmath16 the basic problem of the computation of @xmath0 is that , after every @xmath14 , the calculation starts from the beginning and may yield an altogether different @xmath17 than the @xmath18 interval .",
    "thus , since @xmath0 is influenced by the whole evolution of @xmath6 , the time needed for @xmath19 ( or the @xmath17 ) to converge is not known a priori and may become extremely long .",
    "this makes it often difficult to tell whether @xmath0 finally tends to a positive value ( chaos ) or converges to zero ( order ) .    in recent years",
    ", several methods have been introduced which try to avoid this problem by studying the evolution of deviation vectors , some of which are briefly discussed in sec.[compare ] . in the present paper , we focus our attention on the method of the smaller alignment index ( sali )  @xcite , performing a systematic study of its behavior in the case of autonomous hamiltonian systems with 2 ( 2d ) and 3 ( 3d ) degrees of freedom .",
    "this method has been applied successfully to several 2dimensional ( 2d ) and multidimensional maps @xcite , where sali was found to converge rapidly to zero for chaotic orbits , while it exhibits small fluctuations around non  zero values for ordered orbits .",
    "it is exactly this  opposite \" behavior of the sali which makes it an ideal indicator of chaoticity : unlike the maximal lce , it does not start at every step a new calculation of the deviation vectors , but takes into account information about their convergence on the unstable manifold from all the previous steps .",
    "the method has already been used successfully as a chaos detection tool in some specific hamiltonian systems @xcite , although some authors @xcite use different names for the sali .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ ap ] we recall the definition of the sali and present results distinguishing between ordered and chaotic motion in 2 and 3degrees of freedom ( 2d and 3d ) hamiltonians , comparing also the efficiency of the sali with the computation of @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "[ behavior ] we explain the behavior of the sali for ordered and chaotic orbits , showing that in the latter case sali converges exponentially to zero following a rate which depends on the difference of the two largest lyapunov exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in sec.[discussion ] we demonstrate the ability of the method to reveal the detailed structure of the dynamics in the phase space . in sec .",
    "[ compare ] we compare the sali method with some other known methods of chaos detection and in sec .  [ summary ] we summarize our results .",
    "the basic idea behind the success of the sali method @xcite is the introduction of a simple quantity that clearly indicates if a deviation vector is aligned with the direction of the eigenvector which corresponds to the maximal lce . in general ,",
    "any two randomly chosen initial deviation vectors @xmath20 , @xmath21 will become aligned with the most unstable direction and the angle between them will rapidly tend to zero @xcite .",
    "thus , we check if the two vectors have the same direction in phase space , which is equivalent to the computation of the above  mentioned angle .",
    "more specifically , we follow simultaneously the time evolution of an orbit with initial condition @xmath22 and two deviation vectors with initial conditions @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "as we are only interested in the directions of these two vectors we normalize them , at every time step , keeping their norm equal to 1 .",
    "this controls the exponential increase of the norm of the vectors and avoids overflow problems . since , in the case of chaotic orbits the normalized vectors point to the same direction and become equal or opposite in sign , the minimum of the norms of their sum ( _ antiparallel alignment index _ ) or difference ( _ parallel alignment index _ ) tends to zero .",
    "so the sali is defined as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the time and @xmath25 denotes the euclidean norm . from the above definition",
    "is evident that @xmath26 $ ] and when @xmath27 the two normalized vectors have the same direction , being equal or opposite .    in order to apply the sali method to hamiltonian systems",
    ", we shall use here two simple examples with 2 and 3 degrees of freedom : the well  known 2d hnon  heiles system @xcite , having the hamiltonian function : @xmath28 with equations of motion : @xmath29 and the 3d hamiltonian system : @xmath30 with equations @xmath31 studied in @xcite .",
    "we keep the parameters of the two systems fixed at the energies @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "a simple qualitative way of studying the dynamics of a hamiltonian system is by plotting the successive intersections of the orbits with a poincar surface of section ( pss ) @xcite .",
    "this method has been extensively applied to 2d hamiltonians , as in these systems the pss is a 2dimensional plane . in 3d systems",
    "however , the pss is 4dimensional and the behavior of the orbits can not be easily visualized .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is to project the pss to spaces with lower dimensions ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "however , even these projections are often very complicated and difficult to interpret .    in order to illustrate the behavior of the sali in 2d and 3d systems we first consider some representative ordered and chaotic orbits . in fig .",

    "the ordered orbit corresponds to a closed ( solid ) elliptic curve , while the chaotic one is represented by the dots scattered over the pss .",

    "( [ eq:2dhameq ] ) , with a pss defined by @xmath42 .",
    "the points of the ordered orbit lie on a torus and form a smooth closed curve on the pss . on the other hand ,",
    "the points of the chaotic orbit appear randomly scattered .",
    "the time evolution of the sali for these two orbits is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dexample](b ) . in the case of the ordered orbit ( solid line )",
    "the sali remains different from zero , while in the case of the chaotic orbit ( dashed line ) , after a small transient time , the sali falls abruptly to zero . at @xmath45",
    "the sali becomes zero as it has reached the limit of the accuracy of the computer ( @xmath46 ) , which means that the two deviation vectors have the same direction .",
    "thus , after @xmath47 the two normalized vectors are represented by exactly the same numbers in the computer and we can safely argue , that to this accuracy the orbit is chaotic . actually , we could conclude that the orbit is chaotic even sooner , considering that the directions of the two vectors _ practically _ coincide when the sali reaches a small value , e.g.  @xmath48 after some @xmath49 time units .",

    "for every different pair of initial vectors @xmath64 , @xmath63 we compute the time @xmath65 needed for the sali to become smaller than a very small value e.g.  @xmath66 and check if the value of @xmath65 depends on the particular choice of initial deviation vectors .",

    ". the maximum value of @xmath65 for @xmath75 corresponds to the case of @xmath63 being almost perpendicular to the unstable manifold which passes near the initial condition of the orbit . in this case",
    "the component of @xmath63 along the unstable direction is almost zero and thus , the time needed for the vector to develop a significant component along this direction , which will eventually lead it to align with the other deviation vector , is maximized .",
    "we remark that for all @xmath76 @xmath65 does not change significantly , as it practically varies between 400 and 500 time units .",
    "as there is no reason for @xmath64 , @xmath63 to be on the pss the second test we perform is to compute @xmath65 for 1000 @xmath63 whose coordinates are randomly generated numbers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : random]b ) . from the results of fig.[fig : random ] we see that @xmath65 practically does not depend on choice of the initial deviation vectors .    on the other hand ,",
    "the computation of the maximal lce , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : lyap ] ) , despite its usefulness in many cases , does not have the same convergence properties over the same time interval .",
    "this becomes evident in fig .",

    "on the other hand , the computation of the @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2dcomp](a ) ) up to @xmath80 or even up to @xmath82 , still shows no clear evidence of convergence .",
    "although fig .",
    "[ fig:2dcomp](a ) suggests that the orbit might probably be chaotic , it does not allows us to conclude its chaotic nature with certainty , and so further computations of @xmath19 are needed .",
    "thus , it becomes evident that an advantage of the sali , with respect to the computation of @xmath19 , is that the current value of the sali is sufficient to determine the chaotic nature of an orbit , in contrast to the maximal lce where the whole evolution of the deviation vector affects the computed value of @xmath19 .",
    "as we have seen for ordered orbits the sali remains different from zero fluctuating around some non  zero value .",
    "the behavior of the sali for ordered motion was studied and explained in detail in the case of a completely integrable 2d hamiltonian @xcite , in which no chaotic orbits exist .",
    "it was shown that any pair of arbitrary deviation vectors tend to the tangent space of the torus , on which the motion is governed by 2 independent vector fields , corresponding to the 2 integrals of motion .",
    "thus , since @xmath83 and @xmath84 , in general have one component ` along ' and one ` across ' the torus , there is no reason why they should become aligned and thus typically end up oscillating about two different directions .",
    "this explains why the sali does not go to zero in the case of ordered motion .",
    "now let us investigate the dynamics in the vicinity of chaotic orbits of a hamiltonian system of @xmath85 degrees of freedom .",
    "an orbit of this system is defined by @xmath86 , with @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 being the generalized coordinates and the conjugate momenta respectively .",
    "the time evolution of this orbit is given by hamilton s equations of motion @xmath90 solving the variational equations about a solution of ( [ eq : hameq ] ) , @xmath91 , which represents our reference orbit under investigation , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the jacobian matrix of @xmath94 , we get the time evolution of an initial deviation vector @xmath95 , for sufficiently small intervals @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "note now that , in this context , the eigenvalues @xmath97 of @xmath98 , at @xmath99 , may be thought of as local lyapunov exponents , with @xmath100 the corresponding unitary eigenvectors .",
    "these eigenvalues in fact oscillate about their time averaged values , @xmath101 , which are the global lces of the dynamics in that region .",
    "as is well  known in hamiltonian systems , the lyapunov exponents of chaotic orbits are real and are grouped in pairs of opposite sign with at least two of them being equal to zero @xcite .",
    "thus , the evolution of any initial deviation vector @xmath20 is given by : @xmath102 where the @xmath103 are in general complex numbers and @xmath104 , @xmath105 depend on the specific location in phase space , @xmath106 , through which our orbit passes .",
    "note that we consider here only real eigenvalues and hence real @xmath103 .",
    "if some of the @xmath104 are complex , their corresponding contribution to ( [ eq : w1_1 ] ) will be oscillatory and will not affect the argument that follows .    to get a first rough idea of the way the sali evolves",
    ", we now make some approximations on the evolution of this deviation vector .",
    "first let us assume that the @xmath104 do not fluctuate significantly about their averaged values and hence can be approximated by them , i.e.  @xmath107 .",
    "secondly , we consider that the major contribution to @xmath108 comes from the two largest terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : w1_1 ] ) , so that : @xmath109 in this approximation , we now use ( [ eq : w1_2 ] ) to derive a leading order estimate of the ratio @xmath110 and an entirely analogous expression for a second deviation vector : @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "in order to compute the sali , as defined by ( [ eq : sali ] ) we add and subtract eqs .",
    "( [ eq : w1_4 ] ) and ( [ eq : w2_4 ] ) keeping the norm of the minimum of the two evaluated quantities .",
    "thus , @xmath114 does not appear in the expression of the sali , which becomes @xmath115 denoting by @xmath116 the positive quantity on the r.h.s of the above equation and using the fact that @xmath117 is a unitary vector we get @xmath118 eq .  ( [ eq : saliap_2 ] ) clearly suggests that the sali for chaotic orbits tends to zero exponentially and the rate of this decrease is related to the two largest lces of the dynamics .",
    "let us test the validity of this result by recalling that 2d hamiltonian systems have only one positive lce @xmath0 , since the second largest is @xmath119 .",

    "( [ eq:2dhameq ] ) for a similar grid of initial conditions .    for 3d hamiltonians",
    "the pss is 4dimensional and thus , not so useful as in the 2d case . on the other hand",
    ", the sali can again identify successfully regions of order and chaos in phase space . to see this ,",
    "let us start with initial conditions on a 4d grid of the pss and attribute again the final value of the sali of an orbit to all the points visited by the orbit .",
    "in this way , we again find regions of order and chaos , which may be visualized , if we restrict our study to a subspace of the whole 4d phase space . as an example , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dcolor](b ) the subspace @xmath56 , @xmath41 of the 4d pss @xmath52 of the 3d system ( [ eq:3dham ] ) , using the same technique as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dcolor](a ) .",
    "again we can see regions of ordered ( colored in light gray ) and chaotic motion ( colored in black ) , as well as sticky chaotic orbits ( colored in deep gray and gray ) at the edges of these regions .",
    "pictures like the ones of fig .",
    "[ fig:2dcolor ] , apart from presenting the regions of order and chaos , could also be used to estimate roughly the fraction of phase space volume occupied by chaotic or ordered orbits and provide good initial guesses for the location of stable periodic orbits , in regions where the motion is ordered .",
    "the results presented in the previous sections show that the sali is a simple , efficient and easy to compute tool for distinguishing between ordered and chaotic motion .",
    "implementing the sali is an easy computational task as we only have to follow the evolution of an orbit and of two deviation vectors , computing in every time step the minimum norm of the difference and the addition of these vectors . in the case of chaotic motion",
    "the sali eventually tends exponentially to zero , reaching rapidly very small values or even the limit of the accuracy of the computer . on the other hand , in the case of ordered motion",
    "the sali fluctuates around non ",
    "zero values .",
    "it is exactly this different behavior of the sali that makes it an ideal tool of chaos detection .",
    "the sali has a clear physical meaning as zero , or a very small value of the index , signifies the alignment of the two deviation vectors .",
    "an advantage of the method is that the index ranges in a defined interval ( @xmath169 $ ] ) and so very small values of the sali ( e.  g.  smaller than @xmath48 ) establish the chaotic nature of an orbit beyond any doubt .",
    "the sali helps us decide the chaotic nature of orbits faster and with less computational effort than the estimation of the maximal lce .",
    "this happens because the time needed for @xmath19 to give a clear and undoubted indication of convergence to non  zero values is usually much greater than the time in which the sali becomes practically zero , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig:2dcomp ] , [ fig:2dfit ] and [ fig:3dfit ] .",
    "many other chaos indicators have been introduced in recent years , some of which are compared in this section with the sali .",
    "we also study in more detail the latest method we very recently became aware of , the so  called 01 test , introduced by gottwald and melbourne @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the sali was compared in @xcite with the well  known method of the fast lyapunov indicator ( fli ) @xcite and the method of the spectral distance @xmath170 of spectra of stretching numbers @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the sali has comparable behavior to the fli both for ordered and chaotic orbits , with the sali being able to decide the nature of an orbit at least as fast as the fli .",
    "an advantage of the sali method with respect to the fli is the fact that the sali ranges in a given interval , with very small values corresponding to chaotic behavior , while the values of fli increase in time , both for ordered and chaotic motion , but with different rates .",
    "so , the interpretation of different colors in color plots produced by the sali method , like the ones of fig .  [ fig:2dcolor",
    "] , does not depend on the integration time of the orbits , in contrast to similar plots of the fli , since the range of fli values changes as time grows . as was explained in detail in @xcite",
    "the computation of the sali is much easier and faster than the computation of the spectral distance @xmath170 , mainly because we do not have to go through the computation of the spectra of stretching numbers .",
    "also the sali can be used to distinguish between order and chaos in the case of 2d maps , where the spectral distance @xmath170 can not be applied .",
    "sndor et al .",
    "@xcite comparing the relative lyapunov indicator ( rli ) method with the sali showed that both indices have similar behaviors even in cases of weakly chaotic motion .",
    "the rli is practically the absolute value of the difference of @xmath19 of two initially nearby orbits , with very small values of the rli denoting ordered motion , while large differences between the @xmath19 s denote chaotic behavior ( for more information on the rli method see @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the computation of the rli requires the time evolution of two orbits and two deviation vectors ( one for each orbit ) , while the computation of the sali is faster as we compute one orbit and two deviation vectors .    very recently ,",
    "gottwald and melbourne @xcite introduced a new test for distinguishing ordered from chaotic behavior in deterministic dynamical systems : the 01 test .",
    "the method is quite general and can be applied directly to long time series data produced by the evolution of a dynamical system . in that sense ,",
    "the 01 test is more general than the sali for the computation of which we need to know the equations that govern the evolution of the system , as well as its variational equations .",
    "the 01 test uses the real valued function : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is , in general , any observable of the underlying dynamics and @xmath173 with @xmath174 being a positive constant . by defining the mean  square  displacement of p(t ) : @xmath175 and setting @xmath176",
    "one takes the limit @xmath177 and characterizes the particular orbit as ordered if @xmath178 , or chaotic if @xmath179 .",
    "the justification of the 01 test , as well as applications of the method to some dynamical systems can be found in @xcite .    in order to compare the 01 test with the sali method we apply it in the cases of the ordered and chaotic orbits of the hnon",
    " heiles system ( [ eq:2dham ] ) presented in fig.[fig:2dexample ] .",
    "recall that in the case of the chaotic orbit the sali determines the true nature of the orbit at @xmath45 when @xmath180 , or even at @xmath181 if we consider the more loose condition that @xmath182 guarantees chaoticity .",
    "we consider as an observable @xmath183 the quantity : @xmath184 while for the constant @xmath174 we adopt the value used in @xcite , i.  e.  @xmath185 .",
    "the application of the 01 test requires a rather long time series of the observable @xmath183 in order to reliably compute firstly @xmath186 for @xmath187 ( eq.[01 m ] ) and secondly @xmath188 as the limit of @xmath189 for @xmath190 ( eq .  [ 01k ] )",
    ". in our computations we set @xmath191 time units and compute @xmath189 for @xmath192 , which means that the particular orbit is integrated up to @xmath193 time units .",
    "although the assumption @xmath194 , which is formally required for the convergence of @xmath189 ( see @xcite ) , is not fulfilled , the behavior of @xmath189 for the ordered and chaotic orbit is different , allowing us to distinguish between the two cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] ) .    .",
    "@xmath189 oscillates with an amplitude decreasing towards @xmath178 for the ordered orbit ( solid line ) , while it tends to @xmath179 for the chaotic orbit ( dashed line ) .",
    ", width=7,height=7 ]    in particular , @xmath189 increases for the chaotic orbit ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] ) showing a tendency to reach @xmath179 , while it tends to @xmath178 for the ordered orbit ( solid line in fig.[fig:01 ] ) exhibiting fluctuations of slowly decreasing amplitude . from these results",
    "it is obvious that the true nature of the orbits is determined correctly by the 01 test , but the computational effort needed in order to be able to characterize the orbits is much higher than in the case of the sali .",
    "this difference is due to , firstly , the more complicated way of estimating @xmath188 , in comparison with the computation of the sali , as we have to compute several integrals , and secondly , the fact that we must compute the particular orbit for sufficiently long time , in order to approximate the limits of eqs .",
    "( [ 01 m ] ) , ( [ 01k ] ) .",
    "of course , as we have already mentioned , the 01 test is more general as it can also be readily applied to time series data , without knowing necessarily the equations of the dynamical system .",
    "in this paper we have applied the sali method to distinguish between order and chaos in 2d and 3d autonomous hamiltonian systems , and have also analyzed the behavior of the index for chaotic orbits .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "* the sali proves to be an ideal indicator of chaoticity independent of the dimensions of the system .",
    "it tends to zero for chaotic orbits , while it exhibits small fluctuations around non  zero values for ordered ones and so it clearly distinguishes between these two cases .",
    "its advantages are its simplicity , efficiency and reliability as it can rapidly and accurately determine the chaotic vs ordered nature of a given orbit . in regions of ` stickiness ' , of course , along the borders of ordered motion it displays transient oscillations .",
    "however , once the orbit enters a large chaotic domain the sali converges exponentially to zero , often at shorter times than it takes the maximal lyapunov exponent to converge to its limiting value .",
    "* we emphasize that the main advantage of the sali in chaotic regions is that it uses two deviation vectors and exploits at every step , their convergence to the unstable manifold from all previous steps .",
    "this allows us to show that the sali tends to zero for chaotic orbits at a rate which is related to the difference of the two largest lyapunov characteristic exponents @xmath0 , @xmath1 as @xmath195 . by comparison ,",
    "the computation of the maximal lce , even though it requires only one deviation vector and one exponent , @xmath0 , often takes longer to converge , since it needs to average over many time intervals , where the calculation of this exponent is independent from all previous intervals .",
    "the sali was also proved to have similar or even better performance than other methods of chaos detection which were briefly discussed in sec.[compare ] . *",
    "the @xmath169 $ ] and its value characterize an orbit of being chaotic or ordered . exploiting this feature of the index we have plotted detailed phase space portraits both for 2d and 3d hamiltonian systems , where the chaotic and ordered regions are clearly distinguished .",
    "we were thus able to trace in a fast and systematic way very small islands of ordered motion , whose detection by traditional methods would be very difficult and time consuming .",
    "this approach is therefore expected to provide useful tools for the location of stable periodic orbits , or the computation of the phase space volume occupied by ordered or chaotic motion in multidimensional systems , where the pss is not easily visualized , and very few other similar techniques of practical value are available .",
