    "the main objective of this paper is to understand the long range rapidity correlations of charged - particle pairs in the azimuthal angle separation between the two particles around the near side @xmath1 , the so - called ridge which has been recently observed at the lhc in @xmath2 tev pb+pb collisions @xcite and also in @xmath3 tev proton - proton ( @xmath4 ) collisions @xcite .",
    "the cms collaboration @xcite recently reported that the ridge type structure exists in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath3 tev for high multiplicity @xmath5 event selections .",
    "the origin of the ridge in @xmath4 collisions at the lhc is not still well understood and it has been a subject of growing interest , see for example refs .",
    "the ridge was previously seen at rhic in central cu+cu collisions at @xmath6 gev and in au+au collisions at @xmath7 gev @xcite .",
    "the description of nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath8 ) collisions is generally more complicated compared to the case of @xmath4 collisions .",
    "however , given the relative similarity of the observed ridge structure in both @xmath4 and @xmath8 collisions in terms of multiplicity , transverse momenta and rapidity separations of pairs , it is natural to ask whether the ridge phenomenon has a unique origin and can be understood only by initial - state effects .",
    "we recall that the highest multiplicity events per unit rapidity in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath3 tev is compatible to the one in central cu+cu collisions at rhic .    in high density qcd",
    ", we expect large rapidity correlations for produced hadron pairs with the value of their transverse momenta about the gluon saturation scale @xmath9 @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite . at first sight",
    ", these correlations should be small at fixed impact parameters .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that in the color - glass - condensate ( cgc ) approach @xcite there is a source of the long range rapidity correlations which transforms into the azimuthal angle correlations due to the collective flow in the final state . in ref .  @xcite it is argued that such mechanism can qualitatively explain the azimuthal angle correlations in proton - proton collisions without a significant flow effect .",
    "the issue of the importance of final - state and collective flow effects in the observed ridge structure in @xmath4 collisions @xcite is still debatable @xcite , see also refs .  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will introduce a new source of long - range azimuthal correlations for the produced charged hadron pairs .",
    "we show that the intrinsic long - range rapidity correlations between the produced hadron pairs from two parton showers generate considerable azimuthal angle correlations which do not depend on the interaction in the final state , and because of this , these correlations have the same origin both in @xmath4 and @xmath8 interactions at high energy . these correlations have no @xmath0 suppression as one considered in refs .",
    "recently kovner and lublinsky in a very nice paper @xcite put forward a general discussion toward understanding the ridge .",
    "we have an additional goal here , like ref .",
    "@xcite we shall try in this paper to understand the general feature of the ridge based on very general grounds and will show that the main features of these correlations both in rapidity and emission angle can be simply understood within the bfkl pomeron calculus @xcite .",
    "the extension beyond this framework inside the saturation regime will be also discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec ii , we introduce our mechanism for the azimuthal correlations and illustrate the main idea within the perturbative framework . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider double inclusive gluon production and its correlations within the bfkl pomeron approach . we show that the azimuthal correlations between produced hadron pairs from two bfkl parton showers have long - range nature and will survive the bfkl leading log - s re - summation . in sec .",
    "iv , we provide estimates of azimuthal correlations in both @xmath4 and @xmath8 collisions in the bfkl and the saturation regions . as a conclusion , in sec .",
    "v we highlight our main results .",
    "in this section , we show that the long range rapidity correlations in azimuthal angle separation between the hadron pairs can be simply understood in the perturbative qcd approach . in the parton - like language , the mueller diagram @xcite shown in ( right panel ) describes the emission of two particles ( partons ) from two parton showers .",
    "one can write the contribution of this diagram to the cross - section of double inclusive gluon production in the following generic form , [ bfklem1 ] = d^2 q_t n_h^2(q_t^2 ) ( _ t)(-_t ) , where @xmath10 is the scattering amplitudes for pomeron ( ladder)-hadron productions along which transverse momentum @xmath11 is transferred and @xmath12 denotes the corresponding cross - section of the gluon production with rapidity @xmath13 and @xmath14 in each of the bfkl pomeron ladders .",
    "this factorization is based on the leading log - s approximation ignoring enhanced pomeron diagrams .",
    "can be motivated @xcite using three main ingredients : gribov reggeon @xcite and pomeron @xcite calculus , agk cutting rules @xcite and mueller generalized optical theorem @xcite . in the pomeron calculus",
    "the amplitude @xmath10 is a new ingredient which can be written in the following form , [ eqn ] n_h(q_t)=^m_max_n = 1g^2_n(q_t)+^_m_max g_p(q_t=0)g_3(q_t)(m^2/s_0)^-_+  , where @xmath15 denotes the number of produced state with mass @xmath16 in the diffractive dissociation with @xmath17 as its maximum value ( about @xmath18 gev ) by which one can still express @xmath19 as a sum of resonances , @xmath20 denotes the vertex of the pomeron with this state ( @xmath21 for @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 denotes triple pomeron vertex .",
    "the first term in describe the contribution of the state with finite mass and this sum can be approximated by the sum of produced resonances .",
    "the second term is responsible for high mass contribution and can be described by the pomeron contribution which leads to the factor @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the pomeron intercept and @xmath26 is the energy scale ( @xmath27 ) @xcite , see . in the framework of the high energy pomeron phenomenology it turns out that @xmath28 dependence of the resonance contribution is much steeper than the one in the triple pomeron term . in the bfkl pomeron calculus",
    "this fact has a natural explanation : the resonance contributions are determined by the non - perturbative soft scale which is about 1 fm , while the triple bfkl pomeron vertex has a natural scale of the order of the saturation scale which increases with energy .",
    "it should be stressed that @xmath10 has a very simple physical meaning , namely @xmath29 is the probability to produce two parton - showers in hadron - hadron collisions .    .",
    ", width=453 ]    at first sight , one may expect that describes two independent parton showers , and therefore there should not be any correlation between two produced gluons from these two parton showers . however , angular correlations stem from the @xmath11 integration in . due to this integration",
    "the contribution of diagram in is not equal to the product of two single inclusive cross - sections leading to nonzero two particle correlation @xmath30 . in order to illustrate this simple fact ,",
    "let us for the sake of argument assume that the gluon production cross - section in one parton shower is proportional to @xmath31 , or in other words , ( q_t)_t _ i , t . in this case , simply becomes [ bfklem11 ] & & d^2 q_t n_h^2(q^2_t ) ( q^2_t)(q^2_t)(_t _ 1,t)(_t _ 2,t ) , + & = & -_1,t_2,t(/2 ) d q^2_t n_h^2(q^2_t ) ( q^2_t)(q^2_t ) .",
    "the above equation explicitly shows an angular correlation between two produced gluons in two parton showers . having this equation in mind , in the next section",

    "moreover , we should stress that the expansion here are only for the purpose of illustration to trace back the origin of the azimuthal angle correlations in our approach while for the practical estimates , one has to perform the integrals without resorting to any approximation .",

    "actually , these two expansions correspond to different regions of integrand in . summing these two contributions,[bfklem4 ] ) the transverse momentum of produced gluon is compensated by the gluon with the value of the rapidity smaller than the rapidity of the produced gluon with the transverse momentum @xmath51 ( gluon with rapidity 0 in -a ) , while expansion in @xmath52 we consider the process where @xmath51 is balanced by the gluon with the rapidity larger than the rapidity of the produced gluon with the transverse momentum @xmath51 ( gluon with rapidity @xmath53 in -a ) .",
    "] we obtain the following form for the double inclusive cross - section from in the case of @xmath54 , [ bfklem5 ] & & = d^2 q_t n_h^2(q_t ) ( q_t = 0)(q_t = 0 ) + & & + 32   p^2_1,tp^2_2,t(2 + ( 2 ) ) d^2 q_tq^4_t n_h^2(q_t)(q_t = 0)(q_t = 0 ) , + where @xmath55 denotes the angle between @xmath56 and @xmath57 and we defined [ bfklem6 ] = 4 d^2 q_t ( q_t , -q_t)(_t - _ t , _ t - _ t ) , and [ bfklem7 ] = 4 ( q_t , -q_t ) ( _ t - _ t , _ t - _ t)=.in the above , we used the following notation , [ ava - q ] = ,    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     where @xmath58 denotes the unintegrated gluon density of the projectiles @xcite for @xmath59 , [ bfklem8 ] ( q_t ,- q_t ) = . notice that at @xmath60 the inclusive cross - section given in is identical to .",
    "this simple example indicates that we have a natural mechanism for the azimuthal correlations in the framework of perturbative qcd which does not depend on the final state interactions and leads to the correlations inside of initial wave - function of the incoming hadrons . in the next section",
    ", we will show that this azimuthal correlation has long - range nature and will survive the bfkl leading log - s resummation .",
    "the generalization of the born approximation to the case of gluon emissions from the bfkl pomeron can not be simply obtained via by replacing the unintegrated gluon density @xmath58 to the one obtained from the bfkl equation .",
    "indeed , the unintegrated gluon density @xmath58 depends also on @xmath11 and we have to be very careful with putting @xmath61 .",
    "the inclusive gluon product can be generally written as [ 2bfklsh1 ] = 4 d^2 q_tk(q_t ; q_t , _",
    "t)(y - y , q_t , _ t - _ t)(y , _ t - _ t , _ t - _ t + _ t ) , where @xmath62 is the bfkl kernel given in and we defined @xmath63 . in the above , the variable @xmath64 denotes the total rapidity in the lab frame where @xmath65 is the nucleon mass and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the transverse momentum and rapidity of the produced gluon , respectively .",
    "notice that at @xmath59 , the above expression has the same functional form as the @xmath68 factorization @xcite .",
    "the only dependence on @xmath67 comes from the term @xmath69 for which we have the color - singlet bfkl equation @xcite : [ 2bfklsh2 ] ( y , _ t ,",

    "if the above approximation can be justified , let us examine the ladder summations which leads to the bfkl equation . at leading log - s approximation",
    ", the imaginary amplitude @xmath74 of the quark - quark elastic scattering with exchange of a color - singlet gluon ladder whose vertical lines are reggeized gluons @xcite can be written as [ bk - f0 ] _ n ( 2 n)^*(2 n)=s^2c_fg_s^4_n _ i=0 ( ) ^_g(q_i+1,t)+_g(q_i+1,t - q_t ) , where @xmath75 is again the bfkl kernel given in .",
    "the right - hand side of the above equation shows that the bfkl pomeron can be written as a sum of production cross - sections as it follows from the optical theorem .",

    "the expression in takes into account the reggeization of gluons in @xmath80-channel that means that the spin of the gluon is not equal to @xmath81 as in perturbative calculations but it is given by the reggeized gluon trajectory [ gr ] _",
    "g(q_i , t)=1+_g(q_i , t)= 1 + . we recall that the produced gluon in the @xmath82th rung ladder is on - shell with @xmath83",
    ". then , in order to find @xmath11 and @xmath84 correlations one needs only to keep @xmath85 in the @xmath82th rung of the ladder ( see -b ) and to put @xmath59 in all other rungs .",

    "therefore , in order to extract the correlations between two produced gluons , it is sufficient to use in which we can put @xmath59 in @xmath86 and @xmath87 . using and adding the contribution of the integration region in @xmath88 where @xmath89 , we obtain from , & = & d q^2_t n_h^2(q^2_t ) ( q_t = 0)(q_t = 0 ) + & & \\ { 1 + p^2_1,tp^2_2,t q^4_t^2(2+(2 ) ) } , [ 2bfklsh4 ] + & = & n ( 1 + p^2_1,tp^2_2,t q^4_t ^2(2+(2 ) ) ) , [ 2bfklsh5 ] where @xmath55 is the angle between @xmath56 and @xmath57 and we defined the following notations , & = & , [ 2bfklsh61 ] + q^2n_t&= & , [ 2nbfklsh62 ] with @xmath90 . the normalization factor @xmath91 in is given by [ 2bfklsh6 ] n d q^2_t n_h^2(q^2_t ) ( q_t = 0)(q_t = 0 ) . from the above , it is obvious that the production of two parton showers with a transverse momentum @xmath11 along the pomeron ladder , naturally leads to the long range rapidity correlation in azimuthal angle while the emissions from one parton shower given by the bfkl pomeron contribution does not lead to such correlations , see also ref .",
    "we recall that the long - range azimuthal angle correlations obtained by is valid in the leading log - s approximation at high - energy .",
    "the azimuthal angle correlations in is uniquely determined by only knowing the average values @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this equation was truncated at @xmath94 assuming that the transverse momentum @xmath28 in the pomeron ladder is small .",
    "let us explore the idea that is also valid in the saturation region ( or at least on the boundary between the bfkl and the saturation regime ) by choosing the corresponding average values @xmath95 and @xmath93 in that region .    in the kinematic regime of the bfkl ( ignoring the saturation effect ) from we obtain @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the non - perturbative soft scale .",
    "at the lhc energies , the inclusive production stems from the kinematic region in which saturation effects are important @xcite . in this region",
    ", the interaction between pomerons leads to more complicated diagrams , the so - called enhanced diagrams shown in .",
    "it has been shown ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) that the enhanced diagram leads to the value of the characteristic momentum of the order of @xmath9 , namely we have @xmath98 .",
    "we do not need to follow complete calculations of this paper to understand why it happens so . indeed , assuming that @xmath99 we can replace the bfkl pomerons in the loop by the pomerons at @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , in this case , we have @xmath100 . for @xmath101 the pomeron exchange",
    "falls down with @xmath28 making the integral being concentrated at @xmath102 . in order words ,",
    "if densities of partons in one parton shower is so large that we have already reached the saturation region of the gluon density , we can assume that the average @xmath103 where @xmath9 is the saturation scale .",
    "this also follows from the high - density qcd within the cgc approach @xcite which describes the lhc data for the inclusive hadron production both in @xmath4 and @xmath8 collisions @xcite , see also ref .",
    "we also assume that the density of partons in _ both _ parton showers is very large and consequently pomeron enhanced diagrams are important , and therefore we can have @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , we assume that in the saturation region we have only one relevant scale , the saturation scale , and the average transverse momenta are related to this scale .",
    "notice that the maximum of the double inclusive production reaches at @xmath105 .",
    "admittedly , we do not have a rigorous proof of this at our disposal without invoking any approximation , but this may be immediately understood within the cgc approach since @xmath9 is the only dimensional parameter of the approach .",

    "note that gives the contribution at small values of @xmath51 and the correlations vanish at @xmath106 and increase with @xmath51 while shows that the correlations falls down at large values of @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , the correlation function has a maximum at @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the typical transverse momentum of the system .",
    "the same argument is valid for the general case of the gluon pairs production from the bfkl pomeron .",
    "this can be seen by comparing and its corresponding equation in the limit of @xmath109 .",

    "one should note that for a denser system , the imposed condition of @xmath139 in shifts the relevant kinematic windows of the angular correlations to the higher @xmath51 since the saturation scale will be larger for a denser system .",
    "next , we consider the long - range correlations in nucleus - nucleus scatterings .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize for the case of nucleus - nucleus collisions in the framework of the glauber approach , namely assuming that multiple scatterings are only permitted on different nucleons while the nucleon - nucleon scattering stems from the bfkl pomeron exchange .",
    "the double inclusive cross - section at a fixed impact - parameter between two center of nuclei @xmath155 will then have the same form as except the extra dependence on the nuclear profile .",
    "notice that the impact - parameter @xmath155 is the conjugate variable to transverse momentum @xmath28 . in the glauber approximation for nuclei",
    ", the scattering amplitude of pomeron - nucleus @xmath156 in the region of small diffractive masses is defined as [ eqna ] n_a(q_t ) & & ( d^2  d^2 e^i _ t s_a(b- ) g_p())^2 , + & &   g^2_p(q_t=0 )  s^2_a(q_t),where @xmath131 denotes the pomeron - proton vertex and @xmath157 is the nuclear density profile defined by the wood - saxon parametrization .",
    "the second equation above is valid when the nuclear radius is larger compared to the proton size @xmath158 . using one",
    "can obtain the following expression for the double inclusive cross - section at fixed @xmath155 in the framework of the glauber approach in which the proton - proton scatterings are taken into account from the bfkl pomeron : [ aa1 ] & = & + & & \\ { t_aa^2(b ) + p^2_1,tp^2_2,t(1/q^4_)^2 ( ^2_b^2_bt^2_aa(b ) ) ( 2+(2 ) ) } , where @xmath159 is the inclusive cross - section for proton - proton scatterings and @xmath160 is the nuclear overlap function for aa collisions .",
    "using one can calculate the correlation function @xmath138 defined in : [ aa3 ] ( b , , y_1,y_2)&=&p^2_1,tp^2_2,t(1/q^4_)^2 ( ^2_b^2_bt^2_aa(b ) ) ( 2+(2 ) ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that in the glauber approach , the inclusive production in @xmath8 collisions is proportional to the overlap function @xmath161 while in the case of the double inclusive production instead it is proportional to @xmath162 .",
    "it is seen from that independent productions are canceled in @xmath138 at fixed @xmath155 while in the integral over @xmath155 the first term in gives the main contribution .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we do not need additional factor @xmath118 as in since in the glauber formulation for nucleus - nucleus scatterings , events with a fixed multiplicity correspond to a definite value of the impact - parameter .",
    "deep inside the saturation region , the correlation function has the same form as for hadron - hadron collisions given by with the saturation momentum replaced by that of the nucleus @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the main idea of the cgc approach that difference between different reactions is only due to the different value of the saturation scale @xmath9 . assuming that we have @xmath164 ( @xmath90 ) in the saturation region , it is seen from that two - particle correlation @xmath113 reduces by increasing the saturation scale of proton",
    "however , the glauber approximation is not reliable deep inside the saturation region , and one should instead use , consequently the slope of the reduction of the azimuthal correlations will be then different .",
    "one of the attractive feature of nucleus - nucleus collisions is that by using centrality cuts , one can study the underlying dynamics of two - particle correlations .",
    "in this paper , we suggested a new mechanism for the long - range rapidity correlations in the azimuthal angle of produced hadron pairs , namely the long - range angle correlations of two parton showers component of the initial partonic ( gluonic ) wave - function .",
    "this mechanism can be conceived as a realization of the general ideas proposed in refs .",
    "our approach predicts large and of the same order long - range angular correlations both for hadron - hadron and nucleus - nucleus collisions inside the gluon saturation region . in our approach ,",
    "the collimation in @xmath152 exists independently of the effects from flow in the later stages of the collisions .",
    "we showed that for extremely dense systems at the truncation level upto @xmath94 for @xmath93 we have @xmath165 ( @xmath166 without correlation ) at @xmath167 , and @xmath113 still has a second local maximum near @xmath168 at @xmath169 .",
    "we showed that our mechanism qualitatively describes the main features of the observed ridge structure in proton - proton collisions at the lhc at @xmath3 tev .",
    "a detailed comparison with experimental data and numerical analysis is left for future .",
    "the main difference between our approach and the description in the framework of the cgc @xcite is that in our approach the saturation region is explored from outside on the boundary with the bfkl region .",
    "we showed that a clear signal of the ridge - type structure emerges by going from the bfkl to the saturation regime .",
    "this is fully consistent with the fact that the saturation / cgc approach provides an adequate description of other @xmath170 tev data in @xmath4 collisions including the inclusive charged - hadron transverse - momentum and multiplicity distribution @xcite .",
    "finally notice that the correlations obtained in our approach is not suppressed with @xmath0 in contrast to the prescription of refs .",
    "@xcite and survive in the leading order in @xmath0 expansion .",
