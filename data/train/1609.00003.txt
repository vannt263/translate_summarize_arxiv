    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ is permitting a great improvement of the knowledge on the celestial objects populating our galaxy .",
    "different surveys and targeted observations have allowed astronomers to observe through the galactic dust , which prevents observations at shorter wavelengths , and many unknown sources have been unveiled .",
    "thanks to the mipsgal legacy survey @xcite , conducted with mips ( the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite identified at @xmath4 428 roundish objects presenting diffuse emission .",
    "these small ( @xmath5 ) rings , disks or shells ( hereafter denoted as ` bubbles ' ) are pervasive throughout the entire galactic plane in the mid - infrared ( ir ) .",
    "the main hypothesis about the nature of the bubbles is that they are different types of evolved stars .",
    "in fact , follow up studies have found among them planetary nebulae ( pne ) , supernova remnants , wolf  rayet ( wr ) stars , luminous blue - variable ( lbv ) stars , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , and so on ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , currently , only about 30 per cent of the bubbles are classified .",
    "the discovery potential and the implications on the galactic physics are huge both for high- and low - mass evolved stars .",
    "massive stars play a pivotal role in the evolution of their host galaxies .",
    "they are among the major contributors to the interstellar ultraviolet radiation and , via their strong stellar winds and final explosion , provide enrichment of processed material ( gas and dust ) and mechanical energy to the interstellar medium , strongly influencing subsequent local star formation .",
    "the details of post - main sequence ( ms ) evolution of massive stars are still poorly understood .",
    "increasing the sample of these stars is fundamental to better constrain evolutionary model parameters . on the other hand",
    "the bubbles catalogue is the right place where to find new pne .",
    "currently only about 15 per cent of the expected galactic pne have been observed @xcite .",
    "this difference is usually explained in terms of strong interstellar extinction in the galactic plane . in general , many kinds of evolved stars are known to be radio emitters . in the last phases of their life the stars undergo several periods of enhanced mass - loss , with their external layers ejected to form a circumstellar envelope ( cse ) .",
    "the now - exposed hot inner part of the star can ionize the cse and continuum radio emission originates from it .",
    "the radio emission is therefore a helpful probe to complement ir observations in classifying the bubbles and deriving their physical properties , being a powerful tool to investigate circumstellar ionized material . between 2010 and 2012",
    "we carried out radio continuum observations with the karl g.  jansky very large array ( vla ) at @xmath0 ( configuration d ) and at @xmath6 ( configuration c and cnb ) of a subset of 55 bubbles ( @xcite ; ` paper i ' hereafter ) .",
    "we were able to calculate the radio spectral index ( @xmath7 defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the flux density and @xmath10 the frequency ) for 18 of them and to determine an upper limit for 13 .",
    "we found that at least 70 per cent of them have spectral indices compatible with a thermal emission .",
    "since one of the main goal of paper i was to accurately calculate the radio flux densities , we chose vla compact configurations to avoid issues from the lack of short - spacing information .",
    "the drawback was a poorer resolution with respect to ir images , and morphological comparisons proved impossible . to overcome this problem , in this paper we present new vla observations at @xmath0 of 18 bubbles , using the more extended b and bna configurations .",
    "the main goal of this work is to show how high - resolution and high - sensitivity radio images are an extremely powerful tool to discriminate low- and high - mass evolved stars , derive physical properties of pne , disclose the mutual interaction of massive star ejecta and , in synergy with 8-@xmath11 m images , immediately recognize possible h ii regions among the bubbles .    in section",
    "[ sec : obs ] we supply technical details of observations and data reduction , grouping the observed bubbles by their radio morphology . in sections [ sec :",
    "bub_cs ] , [ sec : ell ] , [ sec : fill ] and [ sec : others ] we discuss each morphological category separately . in section [ sec : pne ] we comment the result obtained on pne . summary and conclusions are reported in section [ sec : sumcon ] .",
    "in paper i we had found that 44 out of 55 bubbles were unambiguously detected at @xmath0 , with sensitivity limits around @xmath12 . for 18 of them",
    "we were able to measure their flux density both at @xmath6 and at @xmath0 .",
    "this was the starting sample for this follow - up work .",
    "however two of them ( mge 040.3704 - 00.4750 and mge 031.9075 - 00.3087 ) resulted too much extended to be properly imaged with vla ( being more extended than the vla largest angular scale ) and were excluded .",
    "other two bubbles ( mge 034.8961 + 00.3018 and mge 027.3839 - 00.3031 ) , non - detected at @xmath6 , were included in the sample .",
    "we selected these 18 bubbles for higher - resolution 6-cm images .",
    "the sample was split in two groups , each one containing 9 objects , depending on the source declination . for bubbles with declination above @xmath13 we used the vla in configuration b ( baselines from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ) , while for the others we opted for configuration bna .",
    "our choice was driven by the better imaging performance of vla hybrid configurations when observing low - declination sources .",
    "the observations were carried out in march 2015 ( configuration b ) and in may 2015 ( configuration bna ) .",
    "the flux calibrator was , for both groups , 3c286 , while different gain calibrators were chosen from the standard vla calibrators list , selected to be as close as possible to targeted sources .",
    "the time on source for the bubbles varied from 8 to 20 minutes , as reported in table [ tab : obs ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : fill ]    the distance calculation is not performed on mge 002.2128 - 01.6131 since , as reported in paper i , it is not optically thin at @xmath0 .",
    "again we underline that the values reported in table [ tab : fill ] are meaningful only if the sources are truly pne and , even if those values are in agreement to what should be expected from pne , they can not be used to demonstrate the pn nature of these bubbles . however ,",
    "if the pn hypothesis is true , we can notice how the values in table [ tab : fill ] are very similar to those in table [ tab : pne ] .",
    "we report the filled elliptical bubbles in figure [ fig : gal ] as open circles .",
    "in @xcite we found that the distance of the four pne studied in that work ranged between 1.6 and @xmath16 .",
    "those bubbles were selected because they were resolved also in d - configuration observations . from their angular extension",
    "we estimate diameter values between 0.28 and @xmath17 , in accordance to those derived in this paper .",
    "the different angular dimension of the bubbles in @xcite should then been ascribed mostly to their smaller distance rather than to physical differences .",
    "one of the most promising aspect of the bubbles catalogue was that it appeared as the perfect place where to search for ` missing pne ' .",
    "it is expected that the number of galactic pne is around @xmath18 ( e.g. @xcite ) , but only about 3300 of them are known @xcite .",
    "when @xcite published the bubbles catalogue , about 15 per cent of them were associated with already classified object , and 90 per cent of them were pne .",
    "the idea was that the pne represented the dominant kind of object among the mipsgal bubbles and , in turn , the catalogue could contain a large quantity of previously unknown pne .",
    "@xcite divided the bubbles into six categories , based on their morphology .",
    "the categories most populated are ` ring ' and ` disk ' nebulae , accounting for 339 objects out of 428 .",
    "as previously discussed , @xcite found that more than 80 per cent of classified ` ring ' and ` disk ' bubbles are pne , and that few other pne are found in other categories .",
    "it is possible to estimate that the entire bubbles sample should contain about 300 pne .",
    "it is important now to establish whether the bubbles catalogue is complete with respect to round and elliptical pne , that is we are going to check if mipsgal successfully detected all the round and elliptical pne resolved as bubbles lying in its field of view .",
    "a round or elliptical pn is listed in the bubbles catalogue only if it is a resolved object .",
    "since mipsgal resolution is @xmath19 we can state that the minimum angular extension for a pn in the bubbles sample must be at least around @xmath20 . in fact this is also the lower limit of the angular extension for bubbles ( except only for two ) . in the previous section we found out that a typical value for an elliptical bubble diameter is around @xmath21 , a value in accordance with many other estimates of the dimensions of pne .",
    "a comparable mean value is derived for filled elliptical bubbles , in the hypothesis that they are pne , and for pne in @xcite .",
    "similar values are found by @xcite in their study of the radio emission of 26 pne from the macquarie / aao / strasbourg h@xmath7 ( mash ) catalogue @xcite .",
    "a pn with a diameter of @xmath21 is seen under an angle of @xmath20 if it is located at about @xmath3 from the observer . in figure",
    "[ fig : gal ] we represent this limit with the outer dashed circumference . beyond this distance mipsgal",
    "is not able to fully resolve an object extended less than @xmath21 , therefore any other pn beyond this limit unlikely is part of the bubbles sample . on the other hand",
    "the largest ring bubble is @xmath22 wide ( and only 18 other bubbles are larger than it ) , the largest bubble classified as pn is @xmath23 and the largest disk bubble is @xmath24 .",
    "we can set then the approximate upper limit of @xmath25 for the pne in the bubbles sample .",
    "a pn with a diameter of @xmath21 appears 60-arcsec wide when it is located at a distance of about @xmath2 .",
    "this distance ( from the observer ) is represented in figure [ fig : gal ] with the inner dashed circumference .",
    "these two distances and the mipsgal field of view ( shaded region in figure [ fig : gal ] ) encompass an area of @xmath26 . now the outer limit of the milky way is somehow arbitrary , here we assume a radius of @xmath27 , a boundary beyond which the star density drops rapidly ( for a discussion on the galactic dimensions and outer rings see @xcite ) .",
    "this radius encompasses a total area of about @xmath28 .",
    "taking into account an exponential radial distribution with a scale - length of @xmath29 @xcite , we found that about 3000 pne fall in the area where they can be observed as mipsgal bubbles .",
    "morphological studies of pne show that about 2/3 of them are elliptical or round , with the remaining showing bipolar or irregular shapes @xcite .",
    "as previously said , in some bipolar pne the emission at @xmath30 , mainly tracing dust , is concentrated at its center .",
    "the 24-@xmath11 m emission is due to both thermal dust continuum and gas lines , with the former decreasing as the pn ages and expands .",
    "the morphologies at @xmath30 , @xmath4 and radio can therefore be very different , depending on the evolutionary age of the pn @xcite .",
    "we can therefore safely state that the number of pne that can be seen as a bubble by mips is approximately around 2000 .",
    "the distribution of the pne heights from the galactic disk was investigated by @xcite , who found a height scale value of @xmath31 for an exponential disk model . limiting our search between @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath33 the average distance of an object in this area is @xmath34 at this distance , @xmath31 correspond to an angle of @xmath35 .",
    "the mipsgal latitude coverage is @xmath36 , except for @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "this means that the mipsgal latitude coverage allows us to observe only about the 30 per cent of pne .",
    "this percentage gives us a total of about 600 pne that should appear as a bubble in mipsgal .",
    "the fact that we likely observe only about 300 pne as mipsgal bubbles can then be ascribed to their aging , as discussed in previous section .",
    "this in turn means that the bubbles catalogue should contain approximately half of the elliptical and round pne located between @xmath2 and @xmath3 from us falling into the mipsgal field of view .",
    "if future studies on the bubbles will confirm our estimation then this result will have two important implications on the search for galactic pne .",
    "first , going backwards through what discussed above , it will pose a constraint on the total number of galactic pne .",
    "since this constraint is mainly derived from a statistical base it could be used as an independent test for the estimates derived from stellar evolution models .",
    "second , it will turn out that the ir band around @xmath4 is probably the best band where next - generation ir telescope shall search for pne .",
    "in particular the _ james webb space telescope _ , improving seven - fold the _",
    "resolution , should be able to observe and resolve all the galactic pne as bubbles ( possibly with the only exception of most evolved ones ) , even if we assume that its sensitivity with respect to _ spitzer _ will just scale up as the ratio of their areas .",
    "in this paper we reported radio observations at @xmath0 of 18 mipsgal bubbles , performed with the vla in configuration b and bna .",
    "the images show that the bubbles can be grouped in five different categories according to their radio morphology .",
    "three bubbles show a clear evidence of a central point - like object ; seven are characterized by an elliptical ring shape and the total lack of a compact central object or diffuse emission toward their centre ; for four bubbles the radio morphology is intermediate between the two previous categories , with diffuse emission toward the centre but without a clear central object ; one has a bipolar appearance ; the remaining three bubbles have a peculiar shape .",
    "the bubbles with a central object in radio images ( mge 027.3839 - 00.3031 , mge 030.1503 + 00.1237 , mge 042.0787 + 00.5084 ) were associated with massive evolved stars , in particular lbvs .",
    "this classification is compatible with the spectroscopic identification of the central star of two of them as b / b[e]/lbv stars .",
    "the radio emission from the central object is likely due to stellar winds .",
    "the cse of mge 042.0787 + 00.5084 shows relevant variations of spectral index , on the contrary the cse of mge 030.1503 + 00.1237 has a more homogeneous spectral index .",
    "the 24-@xmath11 m images of these bubbles show a morphological similarity with radio only in two cases , while at irac wavelengths only the central object is detected .",
    "the elliptical bubbles were associated with pne .",
    "one of them is already classified as pn in literature .",
    "for the others morphological considerations suggest that can be all proposed as pn candidates .",
    "if this hypothesis holds , we derive for them the distance , the diameter , the mean electron density and the ionized mass .",
    "we found that the elliptical bubbles are very similar also from the physical point of view .",
    "we ascribe this similarity to the selection bias of the bubbles catalogue .",
    "four bubbles presented a morphology intermediate between the first two , with the lack of a central object but with diffuse emission toward their centre . on average",
    "they appear fainter at @xmath30 with respect to elliptical bubbles .",
    "nevertheless the radio and the 24-@xmath11 m morphology suggest that they can also be proposed as pn candidates .",
    "the remaining bubbles show different radio morphologies .",
    "one of them , mge 356.7168 - 01.7246 , has a clear bipolar shape .",
    "the 8-@xmath11 m emission of mge 031.7290 + 00.6993 is located outside the radio nebula and is proposed as an h ii region .",
    "mge 032.4982 + 00.1615 is only barely resolved in our radio images .",
    "its flux density probably has varied with respect to 2010 data and its radio spectral index suggests that its radio emission is non - thermal .",
    "we propose that it could be a proto - pn .",
    "finally mge 028.7440 + 00.7076 is a very peculiar object with the radio emission placed outside the @xmath4 .    as discussed in section [ sec : compl ] the knowledge achieved so far in the discovery of pne among the mipsgal bubbles allows us to outline some general assertions about galactic pne .",
    "the number of known galactic pne is about the 15 per cent of what expected .",
    "the explanation is that , lying in proximity of the galactic disk , many of them are heavily obscured in visible light .",
    "ir surveys , like mipsgal , are able to observe through the galactic clouds and potentially discover a large quantity of previously unknown pne . in this sense ,",
    "preliminary results indicated that the bubbles catalogue could harbour many pne .",
    "given the typical diameter of a pn , the field of view and the resolution of mipsgal , we infer that the bubbles catalogue may contain about half of the galactic pne that would be resolved in mipsgal .",
    "it is likely that the most evolved pne are not detected in mipsgal since as the central star becomes white dwarf , the nebular excitation decreases and consequently their flux at @xmath4 .",
    "if this hypothesis will be confirmed , beside the discovery of 250 unknown pne , it will pose an important constraint on the actual total number of galactic pne , being a significant statistical search on a relevant portion of our galaxy .",
    "furthermore it will give the precise indication that the 24-@xmath11 m is the best band where to search for the remaining galactic pne when next - generation ir telescopes will provide better resolution and sensitivity than _",
    "spitzer_.    the main goal of this work was to show the great potential of high - resolution high - sensitivity radio images .",
    "we showed that different kinds of evolved stars have strikingly different radio morphologies .",
    "we showed also how to use radio images to infer several physical properties of these galactic objects .",
    "even for the bubbles that we were not able to classify the discovery of their peculiar radio morphology could lead to further investigations and to the discovery a new shape prototypes .",
    "we want to remark that the imaging performance achieved in these targeted observations are about to be achieved also by several ongoing galactic surveys used as pathfinders for next generation radio telescopes ( e.g. @xcite with vla or @xcite with the atca and askap ) .",
    "this work shows therefore what kind of information we can expect to derive on galactic sources from future radio observations .",
    "recalling the fundamental help of comparing radio maps with ir images , we highlight also the importance of the synergy with future ir telescopes , above all the _ james webb space telescope _ , that will provide us with images of unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution comparable to radio interferometers .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the very large array of the national radio astronomy observatory , a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities inc .. archive search made use of the simbad database and the vizier catalogue access tool , operated by the centre de donnes astronomique de strasbourg , and of the nasa / ipac infrared science archive , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
