    "in recent years the properties of non - fermi liquids have been extensively investigated , both from experimental and theoretical point of view . in particular ,",
    "one of the most spectacular feature appearing in non - fermi liquids is the phenomenon of _ spin - charge ( sc ) separation _ , which is surely relevant for the physics of metals so anisotropic to be considered one dimensional , see for instance @xcite or @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is the key property in the anderson theory of high-@xmath1 superconductors ( cuprates described by d=2 fermionic systems ) , @xcite .    as it is well known , sc separation is an highly non - perturbative phenomenon , and its occurrence in fermionic models is quite hard to prove . up to now",
    "it has been obtained only for the _ spinning luttinger model _ ( or _ mattis model _ ) , @xcite , describing two kind of fermions , with spin @xmath2 and interacting through a short ranged potential .",
    "its exact solvability is due to the linear dispersion relation ( without any form of high energy cutoff ) requiring a `` dirac sea '' of fermions with negative energy ; such features are quite unrealistic in a model aiming to describe conduction electrons in a metal , but they allow to map the interacting fermionic system into a non - interacting bosonic one , and to write the hamiltonian as sum of two , decoupled hamiltonians , respectively for spin and the charge degree of freedom . as a result ,",
    "the two - point schwinger function , in the case of local interaction , factorizes into the product of two functions , with different _ fermi velocities _ , @xmath3 , and different _ critical indices _",
    "@xmath4 , for the density ( @xmath5 ) and the spin ( @xmath6 ) respectively : s_(x_0,x_1)=1(x_0 s_+ix_1)^1/2 + _",
    "1(x_0 s_+ix_1)^1/2 + _ such a factorization appears also in the @xmath7-point schwinger functions ( see @xcite for an explicit formula ) , and it causes a phenomenology considerably different from the one of fermi liquids @xcite .    for certain values of the parameters",
    "the spinning luttinger model reduces to the _ chiral luttinger _ model ; in such a case still hold but @xmath8 , that is in such a model only sc separation and no anomalous dimension is present .",
    "the occurrence of sc separation in more realistic _",
    "non solvable _ models , like the hubbard model , has never been established , as a consequence of the fact that lattice or nonlinear bands prevents the use of bosonization .",
    "it is important to understand sc separation in the framework of renormalization group ( rg ) , which is actually the only method which can be in principle applied in full generality to the complex models appearing in condensed matter in any dimension .",
    "however even in @xmath0 , in which rg methods have been extensively applied , - from the fundamental perturbative analysis in @xcite to the non - perturbative and rigorous construction of luttinger liquids in @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite - very few attention has been devoted to the application to sc separation effects ( with the exception of the recent paper @xcite , in which however several approximations are introduced ) .",
    "in this paper we will show that sc separation can be established in a _",
    "non exactly solvable _ model by using rg methods ; the model we consider is the _ chiral luttinger liquid model _ with a _ bandwidth cut - off _ , describing spinning fermions interacting through a short range potential . for physical applications , the presence of a _",
    "finite _ momentum cut - off is essential as a linear dispersion relation can be a reasonable approximation for a non - relativistic dispersion relation only for momenta close to the fermi surface ; its presence prevents however the possibility of an exact solution through bosonization .",
    "this model have received a great deal of attention since the edge excitations in the fractional quantum hall effect are believed to be a physical realization of a chiral luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "we express the chiral luttinger liquid model directly in terms of _ grassmann variables_. given the interval @xmath9 $ ] , the inverse temperature @xmath10 and a large integer , @xmath11 , we introduce the lattice @xmath12 made of the points @xmath13 , for @xmath14 .",

    "we will prove the following result .",

    "hopefully the methods presented here could be applied to prove spin - charge separation in the @xmath0 or even the @xmath44 hubbard model , despite such problems are of course much harder and pose several extra technical problems .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in the following way . in  2 and ",
    "3 we perform a renormalization group analysis ; in the integration of the ultraviolet scales one has to improve the naive dimensional bounds taking advantage from the non - locality of the interaction , while in the infrared scales dramatic cancellations due to global phase symmetries are exploited . in ",
    "4 we bound the difference of the schwinger functions with and without cut - offs , showing that it has a faster power law decay .",
    "finally in  5 we implement ward identities and schwinger - dyson equations in the rg approach , obtaining an explicit expression of the schwinger functions in the limit of removed cutoff .",
