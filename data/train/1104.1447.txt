    "for the past several years , our research group has been developing a new optical spectrograph concept called the dispersed fourier transform spectrograph , or dfts .",
    "the instrument design merges a traditional fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) with a dispersive grating spectrograph , such that the interferometer output is divided into thousands of narrowband channels , all operating in parallel .",
    "this multiplex advantage boosts the effective throughput of the system by a large factor , making the dfts competitive with echelle spectrographs for spectroscopic analysis of stars , particularly measurement of their radial velocities ( rvs ) .",
    "@xcite describes our prototype device , dfts1 , and explains the underlying theory and hardware implementation in detail .",
    "based upon our commissioning observations with dfts1 , we subsequently designed and built a second - generation version , dfts2 , which we deployed to the steward observatory 2.3-meter bok telescope for a year - long observing campaign . in @xcite , we discuss the dfts2 hardware and present velocimetry measurements of rv standard stars and single - lined spectroscopic binary stars ( sb1s ) .    in this paper , we describe the results from our dfts2 observations of double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb2s ) and double - lined triple systems .",
    "sb2s provide one of the best means for measuring the masses of stars : given an accurate rv curve for each stellar component and the inclination angle @xmath7 of the orbital plane to the observer s line of sight , we can derive the component masses using kepler s third law .",
    "traditional spectroscopic observations with an echelle spectrograph and thorium - argon calibration source can achieve velocity precision of @xmath80.10  km / s on late - type narrow - lined stars @xcite . for greater precision , @xcite has developed a technique using an iodine absorption cell , with which the rvs of a spectroscopic binary can be measured at the 0.0050.010  km / s level .",
    "our dfts2 instrument , in contrast , achieves high rv precision and stability without a superposed reference spectrum .",
    "as described in @xcite , we measure the rvs of non - binary stars and single - lined binaries to 0.010.03  km / s , and anticipate even better performance once thermal stability issues in our instrument design have been addressed .",
    "the data reported in this paper were collected between october 2007 and june 2008 during bright - time observing runs at the 2.3-meter bok telescope of the steward observatory on kitt peak .",
    "an observation of a given sb2 target consisted of 500 exposures spanning a range of interferometer delays corresponding to a spectral resolution of approximately 50,000 .",
    "each exposure lasted 1.0 to 4.0 seconds in duration , depending on the star s brightness and the atmospheric seeing and opacity .",
    "each scan also required a total overhead time of approximately four minutes , independent of exposure time , for ccd readout and moving to the next delay position .",
    "our targets , listed in table  [ star - table ] , were chosen because of their relative brightness and short periods , so that we could acquire many observations per star during the limited duration of this initial observing campaign .",

    "we convert the template spectra into template interferograms , and then compare those model interferograms to the observed interferograms . because interferograms add linearly , we can compute sequences of single - lined interferograms for the a and b components of a binary , spanning a range of radial velocities for each , and then add together a and b interferograms to create a two - dimensional grid of double - lined model interferograms . calculating the @xmath9 difference between the models and the observed interferogram data , we construct a map of fit quality , where the minimum point indicates the best - fit solution for component velocities @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the projection of the @xmath12 contour line onto the @xmath10 and @xmath11 axes provides 1-@xmath13 error bars on each radial velocity point .",
    "the shapes of the @xmath9 contours were elliptical with minor and major axes aligned to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 axes , indicating no significant covariance between the component velocity errors .    for optimal results ,",
    "the template spectra must be well matched to the actual spectra of the two stellar components .",
    "we generated synthetic spectra using the spectrum spectral synthesis package @xcite ( see also http://www.phys.appstate.edu/spectrum/spectrum.html ) , and then varied the transition strength @xmath14 of each line and the projected rotation velocity @xmath15 for each stellar component to minimize the @xmath9 difference between the model and the observed data .",
    "a final template spectrum for each component was calculated from a median - filtered average of transition strengths from the individual observations , and the final two - dimensional rv cross - correlation was then performed using these templates .",
    "we found that we could derive relatively precise and self - consistent @xmath15 values from our interferograms ( as listed in table  [ star - table ] ) ; a future paper will explore the use of dfts data to measure stellar rotation velocities and other line broadening mechanisms .",
