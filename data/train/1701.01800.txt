    "the excess distortion probability is defined as the probability that the distortion between a source sequence and its reproduction is greater than a certain threshold .    for the problem of variable - length lossy source coding under the excess distortion probability , there are mainly two criteria on codeword length : the _ mean codeword length _ and the _",

    "they have treated the case where either the overflow probability or the excess distortion probability is less than or equal to a positive constant asymptotically for general sources . in @xcite , they have dealt with the case where the probability of union of events that the overflow occurs and the excess distortion occurs is less than or equal to a positive constant asymptotically for general sources .",
    "this paper considers the excess distortion probability and the overflow probability as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the primary differences are 1 ) we address the case where both the excess distortion probability and the overflow probability may be positive and 2 ) we analyze both non - asymptotic and asymptotic cases .    the contribution of this paper is the non - asymptotic ( one - shot ) and asymptotic characterizations on the minimum threshold of the overflow probability by using a new smooth max entropy - based quantity . in the non - asymptotic regime ,",
    "coding theorems are shown for both stochastic and deterministic encoders . to show the achievability results",
    ", we give an explicit code construction instead of using the random coding argument .",
    "it turns out that the constructed code satisfies the properties of the optimal code shown in @xcite .",

    "one of the useful properties of the smooth max entropy , which is used in the proof of the achievability result in our main theorem , is schur concavity . to state the definition of a schur concave function ,",
