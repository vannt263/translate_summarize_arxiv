    "a coil - globule ( cg ) transition in dilute polymer solutions is very important phenomenon for the various technological advances , ranging from the polymer functionalizations ( such as polymerization , plasticization , dyeing , etc . ) in chemical industry to encapsulation of the drug compounds into the polymer globules and their subsequent targeted delivery in pharmaceutical applications .",
    "therefore , technological importance of the cg transition attracts great attention of many researchers both theorists and experimentalists in soft matter physics during the last few decades . till",
    "now great efforts have been made in development of cg transtion theory .",
    "existing theoretical models have made a great contribution to an understanding of this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the classical theoretical models @xcite of the cg transition are based on the idea that decreasing of the solution temperature below some threshold value ( theta - temperature ) leads to the dominating attractive interactions between the monomers and , thus , to the collapse of a polymer coil .",
    "such a simple idea allowed one to rationalize the conformational behavior of the real synthetic polymer chains in the solvent media .",
    "it is well known from the experiments ( see , for instance , @xcite ) and md simulations @xcite , that in the dilute polyelectrolyte solutions in the regime of good solvent the cg transition of the flexible polyelectrolyte chain can take place .",
    "this unconventional cg transition is accompanied by the condensation of the counterions onto the polymer backbone .",
    "therefore , this cg transition has a pure electrostatic nature . due to the fact that this electrostatic conformational transition takes place in the regime of good solvent ,",
    "i.e. , when the polyelectrolyte chains are well soluble , we can not use the mentioned above classical models and , consequently , the concept of theta - temperature to describe it theoretically .    up to now",
    ", two possible mechanisms of this electrostatic cg transitions have been proposed . the first mechanism ( see references @xcite ) is based on the idea that the polymer chain collapse is caused by electrostatic correlations @xcite of charged monomers and counterions . more specifically , when the electrostatic interactions become strong enough , the counterions favor to adsorb onto the polymer surface , neutralizing the macromolecule charge .",
    "in this mechanism the counterions are not strongly bounded with the monomers , but can freely move along the polymer backbone . despite of the full neutralizing of the macromolecule charge due to the counterion condensation @xcite ,",
    "the thermal fluctuations of the charge density near its zero value are unavoidable .",
    "this charge density fluctuations , in turn , must lead to cooperative mutual attraction of monomers ( so - called kirkwood - shumaker interaction @xcite ) , causing the cg transition .",
    "it is worth noting that such correlation attraction of like - charged particles can cause the phase separations in colloid and polyelectrolyte solutions ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . due to the fact that this cg transition takes place at large enough coulomb strength ( characteristic electrostatic energy expressed in thermal energy units @xcite ) , it is necessary to go beyond the classical debye - hckel ( dh ) theory to take into account the electrostatic effects .",
    "a successful attempt to describe this electrostatic cg transition beyond the dh theory was undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "the counterions immersed into the background of the macromolecule charge were considered as the one component plasma ( ocp ) @xcite , whose precise equation of state is available in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that accounting for the electrostatic correlations of counterions within the ocp model allowed one to rationalize the relations for the radius of gyration of the polyelectrolyte chain as a function of the coulomb strength obtained from the md simulations @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism is based on the assumption that cg transition takes place due to the effective attraction of the fluctuating dipoles which appear along the polymer backbone due to the counterion condensation .",
    "this mechanism was first proposed in reference @xcite and later discussed in details in references @xcite . however , within all mentioned above theories dipole correlations were considered as pairwise .",
    "indeed , in the works @xcite an influence of the dipole correlations on the polymer chain conformation was accounted by the renormalization of the second virial coefficient attributed to the monomer volume interactions . in references @xcite the electrostatic dipole correlations",
    "have been taken into account using the keesom pair potential . as it was recently showed in the ref .",
    "@xcite , dipole correlations of monomers can be considered as pairwise only when the polymer chain is in the coil state .",
    "however , when the polymer chain is in the globular conformation , electrostatic dipole correlations must be taken into account at the many - body level .",
    "therefore , many - body electrostatic correlations might play a crucial role in the @xmath0dipole@xmath0 mechanism , as well as in the above discussed @xmath0coulombic@xmath0 mechanism of the polyelectrolyte chain collapse .    in principle , in real polyelectrolyte solutions both the coulombic and dipole scenarios of the cg transition might be realized .",
    "it depends mostly on the chemical specifics of the monomers and counterions .",
    "thus both of these mechanisms should be thoroughly analyzed from the first principles of statistical mechanics .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the analysis of dipole mechanism of the cg transition in the diluted solutions of electrically neutral polar polymers with regard to the many - body dipole correlations has not been available in the literature till now .",
    "the aim of this work is to fill this gap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the theoretical background is presented in section 2 , some analytical evaluations  in section 3 , numerical results and discussion  in section 4 , and concluding remarks  in section 5 .",
    "we consider a dielectric flexible polymer chain dissolved in a dielectric solvent which we model as a continuous dielectric medium with the permittivity @xmath1 .",
    "let the monomer segments have the permanent freely oriented dipole moments @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "the latter may be realized for a weak polyelectrolyte chain in the regime of counterion condensation , when the counterions and monomers form the strongly bounded ion pairs @xcite or for the polyzwitterionic macromolecules @xcite . for the sake of simplicity in this study",
    "we shall neglect the polarizability effect attributed to the fluctuations of the absolute value of the dipole moments .",
    "as one can show , accounting of this effect will not change the final outcomes . to study the conformations of the polymer chain , we use simple flory - type @xcite self - consistent field theory ,",
    "considering the radius of gyration @xmath3 as a single order parameter .",
    "therefore , we assume that the polymer chain occupies the volume which can be estimated by the volume of gyration @xmath4 .",
    "the total solvation free energy of the polymer chain can be written as a sum of three terms @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the free energy of the ideal polymer chain which can be calculated by the following interpolation formula @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the expansion factor , @xmath9 is the mean - square radius of gyration of the gaussian polymer chain , @xmath10 is the kuhn length , @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath12 is the temperature .",
    "contribution of the volume interactions to the total free energy we evaluate by the standard flory - huggins ( fh ) relation @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the volume fraction of the monomers , @xmath15 is the effective monomer volume , @xmath16 is the flory - huggins parameter .",
    "in contrast to our previous works @xcite , in this study we do not use the virial equation of state to take into account the volume interactions .",
    "instead , we use the fh interpolation formula to consider the polymer chain conformational behavior in a wide range of the monomer volume fraction .",
    "it is worth noting that in this study we use most simple case , when the fh parameter @xmath16 does not depend on the volume fraction of monomers ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "one can show that inclusion into the theory of this dependence will not change qualitatively final results of the present study .    in this case",
    "the electrostatic contribution to the free energy which is related to the thermal fluctuations of the permanent dipoles on the polymer backbone can be calculated for the large enough gyration volume at the level of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) ( see appendix and @xcite ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the reference dielectric permittivity of dielectric media within the polymer volume @xcite ; @xmath19 is the reference permittivity of the polymeric material which is not related to the orientation fluctuations of the permanent dipoles .",
    "thus , in contrast to our previous work @xcite in the present study to consider the dielectric heterogeneity effects , we take into account the dependence of dielectric permittivity in the gyration volume on the solvent volume fraction .",
    "therefore , minimizing the solvation free energy with respect to the expansion factor @xmath20 , after some algebra we arrive at the following equation @xmath21 @xmath22    the first term in the right hand side of ( [ eq : alpha ] ) determines the influence of volume interactions on the polymer chain conformation .",
    "the second term is related to the many - body electrostatic dipole correlations of monomers .",
    "before we pass to the numerical analysis of ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , it is interesting to discuss the regime of the expanded coil conformation , i.e. , when the expansion factor @xmath23 . in this case",
    "we obtain the following equation @xmath24 where the _ dielectric mismatch _",
    "parameter @xmath25 is introduced .",
    "thus , for the coil conformation one can introduce the second virial coefficient of the monomer - monomer interactions as follows : @xmath26 the first term in the right hand side of ( [ eq : beff ] ) is a second virial coefficient within the fh theory @xcite . the second term is a contribution of the keesom dipole - dipole interaction @xcite which always leads to decreasing the second virial coefficient @xcite . the third term is related to a dielectric mismatch between the pure solvent and polymer material .",
    "physical meaning of the latter contribution is related to the electrostatic interactions between permanent dipoles and dipoles appearing due to excess polarizability of polymer chain in the solvent . as it is well known @xcite ,",
    "excess polarizability occurs due to difference between dielectric permittivities of solvent and polymeric material .",
    "the sign of the latter contribution is determined by the sign of the mismatch parameter @xmath27 .",
    "thus , in the case , when condition @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is satisfied , effect of dielectric mismatch competes with the dipole correlations of monomers . in other words , in this case dielectric mismatch effect tends to expand the polymer coil , whereas the keesom monomer - monomer interaction , oppositely , provokes its shrinking . in the opposite case @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) both of these effects",
    "lead to collapse of the polymer coil .    in conclusion of this paragraph",
    "it is instructive to write expression for electrostatic free energy in the limit of @xmath23 : @xmath32 where we have omitted the term which does not depend on the gyration radius .",
    "the latter relation determines electrostatic free energy of polymer coil at the level of pairwise correlations .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that dipole electrostatic correlations of monomers can be taken into account as pairwise only when the polymer chain is in the coil conformation .",
    "turning to a numerical analysis of ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , we define the following @xmath0coupling@xmath0 parameter @xmath33 which determines a `` strength '' of the dipole electrostatic correlations of monomers . in this study",
    "we shall consider only the case of good solvent ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "2 demonstrates the dependences of expansion factor @xmath20 on the coupling parameter @xmath35 at different values of dielectric mismatch parameter @xmath27 . in region of @xmath29 ( @xmath28 )",
    "one can see the pronounced maxima on the expansion factor curves .",
    "these maxima are related to the mentioned above competition of the keesom dipole - dipole attraction and effective repulsion between monomers attributed to difference between the bulk and local dielectric permittivities ( see previous paragraph ) . for negative",
    "@xmath27 the expansion factor monotonically decreases at increasing coupling parameter . in both cases at large enough coupling parameter",
    "the coil - globule transition proceeds quite smoothly . in fig .",
    "3 the dependences of expansion factor on the dielectric mismatch parameter @xmath27 at different values of the coupling parameter @xmath35 and fixed fh parameter @xmath36 are depicted . as seen on fig .",
    "3 , increasing in the dielectric mismatch parameter @xmath27 leads to swelling of the polymer chain , i.e. , increasing in the expansion factor @xmath20 .",
    "now we would like to compare the results obtained by present theory with those predicted by the theory with the pairwise dipole correlations @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress , that within the latter theory the electrostatic contribution to the free energy is determined by relation ( [ eq : fel_coil ] ) . as it is depicted in fig .",
    "4 , account for the dipole correlations at the many - body level leads to qualitatively different dependence of the expansion factor on the coupling parameter .",
    "indeed , accounting for the dipole correlations at the pairwise level results in an abrupt decrease of the expansion factor , when the coupling parameter exceeds some threshold value , whereas accounting for the higher dipole correlations makes the coil - globule transition smoother .",
    "in conclusion , we have formulated a flory - type self - consistent field theory of flexible polymer chain dissolved in good solvent , whose monomers have permanent freely oriented dipoles taking into account the dipole correlations at the many - body level and effect of the dielectric heterogeneity near the polymer backbone ( _ dielectric mismatch _ effect ) .",
    "we have shown that in the regime of good solvent strong enough electrostatic dipole correlations of monomers lead to coil - globule transition .",
    "however , in contrast to the theory with pairwise dipole correlations , predicting the coil - globule transition as a first - order phase transition @xcite , present many - body level theory predicted that this conformational transition must proceed continuously .",
    "we have demonstrated that the electrostatic dipole correlations of monomers can be taken into account as pairwise only when the polymer chain is in the coil conformation .",
    "for the globular conformation , dipole correlations have to be taken into account at the many - body level .",
    "we have shown that in the case , when the dielectric permittivity of solvent larger than permittivity of polymeric material , the dielectric mismatch effect competes with the electrostatic dipole correlations of monomers , expanding the polymer coil . in opposite case , when the dielectric permittivity of solvent smaller than permittivity of polymer material , both effects dielectric mismatch and electrostatic dipole correlations lead to the polymer chain collapse .",
    "finally we would like to discuss the possible applications of present theoretical model .",
    "first , it can be used as a theoretical background for analysis of conformational behavior of weak polyelectrolyte chains in the regime of counterion condensation or polyzwitterionic macromolecules in the dilute solutions .",
    "second , this theory might be combined with theory of polyelectrolyte chain collapse induced by the electrostatic correlations of counterions @xcite .",
    "the latter is a subject of forthcoming publications .",
    "here we present a derivation of electrostatic contribution ( [ eq : fel ] ) to the solvation free energy of the polymer chain , which is related to the monomer dipole correlations .",
    "we would like to stress that theory which will be presented below can be applied to both the single polar polymer chain and concentrated solution of interpenetrated polar polymer chains .",
    "the electrostatic contribution can be expressed via the electrostatic partition function @xmath37\\right>,\\ ] ] as follows @xmath38 where the operator - inverse @xmath39 with respect to the operator @xmath40 and the microscopic dipole charge density @xmath41 are introduced ; @xmath42 is the reference dielectric permittivity which is not related to the permanent dipoles of monomers ; symbol @xmath43 means average over the dipole orientations and the positions of monomers .    using the standard hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation ,",
    "we rewrite the electrostatic partition function as the following functional integral @xmath44\\left<\\exp\\left[i\\left(\\hat{\\rho},\\psi\\right)\\right]\\right>,\\ ] ] where the short - hand notations @xmath45 and @xmath46 are introduced ; @xmath47 $ ] is the normalization constant .    applying the standard cumulant expansion @xcite in integrand of ( [ eq : hs ] ) and truncating it at second order",
    ", we obtain @xmath48\\right>=\\exp\\left[i\\int_{v}d\\bold{r}\\left<\\hat{\\rho}(\\bold{r})\\right>_{c}\\psi(\\bold{r})-\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{v}d\\bold{r}\\int_{v}d\\bold{r}^{\\prime } \\left<\\hat{\\rho}(\\bold{r})\\hat{\\rho}(\\bold{r}^{\\prime})\\right>_{c}\\psi(\\bold{r})\\psi(\\bold{r}^{\\prime})+ .. \\right]\\ ] ] @xmath49\\ ] ] @xmath50=\\exp\\left[-\\frac{p^2}{6}\\int_{v}d\\bold{r}\\left<\\hat{n}_{m}(\\bold{r})\\right>\\left(\\nabla\\psi(\\bold{r})\\right)^2+ .. \\right],\\ ] ] where the relations @xmath51 and @xmath52 have been taken into account and the microscopic monomer density @xmath53 has been introduced .",
    "therefore , at the level of gaussian approximation we obtain @xmath54\\exp\\left[-\\frac{p^2}{6}\\int_{v}d\\bold{r}\\left<\\hat{n}_{m}(\\bold{r})\\right>\\left(\\nabla\\psi(\\bold{r})\\right)^2\\right]\\ ] ] @xmath55=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\det{g_{0}^{-1}}}{\\det{g^{-1}}}},\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath56 and renormalized dielectric permittivity @xmath57 have been introduced .    in the case of large enough system volume ( @xmath58 ) and homogeneous dielectric media ( @xmath59 ) neglecting the boundary effects , we get the following assess for the electrostatic free energy @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the fourier - images of the green functions of poisson equation for the infinite space ; @xmath63 is the renormalized dielectric permittivity ; @xmath64 is the monomer number density ; @xmath65 is the parameter of ultraviolet cut - off .",
    "the choice of such value of the cut - off parameter @xmath66 is due to the fact that at the scales @xmath67 fluctuations of the electrostatic potential related to the thermal fluctuations of dipoles are absent @xcite . using the above expressions , we obtain finally @xmath68 expression ( [ eq : fel_final ] ) determines the electrostatic contribution to the total free energy of polymer solution related to the dipole electrostatic correlations of monomers at the level of gaussian approximation ( rpa ) .",
