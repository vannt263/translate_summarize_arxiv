    "during the expansion of the universe , cosmological gas that falls into the potential well of a dm concentration eventually shocks when it meets other gas and stops or deflects in its path @xcite .",
    "the post - shock temperature increases with the speed of the fall and therefore with the depth of the potential well , and this depth scales with the halo mass . at small enough halo mass , around @xmath3 for a modest metal abundance @xcite ,",
    "the temperature is sufficiently low that the post - shock cooling time becomes short compared to the dynamical time .",

    "the structures falling in are expected to take the form of filamentary streams or clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the importance of such cold streams is that the gas can reach the disk faster , so sf can begin sooner and achieve a rate that is within a factor of a few of the baryonic accretion rate in the halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at early times , when galaxies were generally low - mass , and at recent times in the case of low - mass galaxies , a significant fraction of the gas from cosmological accretion remains cold and falls directly to the center .",

    "we outline expected observational properties , keeping in mind that the numerical methods used to carry out the simulations may matter for some important details since the resolution is not good enough to capture many of the physical processes controlling the gas infall . for example , the moving mesh code arepo gets less purely - cold gas at high halo mass than do smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) codes because cold filaments break apart and mix with hot halo gas more readily in arepo @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite found higher star formation rates with arepo than sph because realistic turbulent cascades in arepo channel the energy to denser scales where it dissipates at a greater rate .",

    "such equilibrium follows naturally from the gas consumption timescale @xmath8 being shorter than the other relevant timescales in the problem .",

    "( [ 1steq ] ) but without the returned fraction @xmath14 , since the gas returned by stars is not fresh gas , @xmath32 this equation states that all of the cosmic accretion adds to the fresh gas reservoir , which is depleted by star formation ( both the locked - up mass and the returned mass ) and by winds that are proportional to the sfr .",
    "we have assumed that winds carry away fresh gas in proportion to its mass , because the fresh and processed components should mix before significant star formation begins in them , and then both get dragged out by mass loading in the wind .",
    "these are reasonable assumptions since the time during which the gas is able to mix before star formation occurs in it , on average , is the consumption time , @xmath8 , and this is generally much longer than the turbulent crossing time in the ism",
