    "the electronic structure of adsorbed atoms ( adatoms ) or clusters of atoms on surfaces determines the coupling between adsorbate and substrate @xcite , the mutual interaction between the adatoms @xcite , magnetic properties @xcite , as well as their catalytic activity and selectivity @xcite .",
    "the coupling between adatoms is particularly interesting since it plays a crucial role in nucleation and is thus at the base of the microscopic understanding of thin film growth on surfaces @xcite .",
    "typically , the mutual interaction comprises direct and indirect contributions .",
    "direct interactions result from the overlap of atomic orbitals and are responsible for the bonding of dimers in vacuum .",
    "this type of interaction has been investigated for metal dimers in the gas phase and noble - gas matrices @xcite .",
    "an exponential energy splitting of bonding and antibonding states with the atom - atom separation is characteristic for direct coupling .",
    "indirect interactions may become important for adatoms on surfaces and they depend strongly on the electronic structure of the substrate .",
    "in particular , long - ranged and oscillatory coupling between two adatoms or adsorbed molecules is mediated by quasi - two - dimensional electronic continua @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the electronic structure of clusters on surfaces with cluster dimensions and geometric shapes has been analyzed atom by atom .",
    "examples are results from artificial gold chains @xcite , quantum confinement of one - dimensional electronic states to chains of copper atoms @xcite , unoccupied electronic resonances of silver clusters with various sizes and shapes @xcite , and the evolution of the kondo effect of a single magnetic atom with the number of adjacent non - magnetic atoms in vertical @xcite and lateral @xcite hybridization geometries . in a recent study of au dimers on nial(110 )",
    "a splitting of the au monomer resonance into bonding and antibonding states was reported as a function of the au - au separation @xcite .",
    "the emerging picture , which may be inferred from this work , is that substrate - mediated adsorbate - adsorbate interactions weaken the direct coupling between the adsorbates .",
    "in particular , it was found in ref.@xcite that the splitting between bonding and antibonding states varies linearly with the reciprocal mutual au distance , rather than exponentially as would be expected from a direct coupling in vacuum .    here , in a combined experimental and theoretical study , we investigated the evolution of a ag monomer @xmath0 resonance , which shifts toward the fermi level upon approaching a second ag atom .",
    "our theoretical analysis indicated that , at not too large adatom - adatom distances , the interaction between the @xmath0 electronic states on the surface is similar to the direct interaction between the two @xmath0 orbitals in vacuum .",
    "measurements were performed with a custom - built scanning tunnelling microscope operated at @xmath1 and in ultrahigh vacuum with a base pressure of @xmath2 . the ag(111 ) surface and",
    "chemically etched tungsten tips were cleaned by argon ion bombardment and annealing .",
    "individual silver atoms were deposited onto the sample surface by controlled tip - surface contacts as previously described in ref.@xcite . using the tip of the microscope , silver dimers were fabricated by atom manipulation .",
    "spectra of the differential conductance ( @xmath3 ) were acquired by superimposing a sinusoidal voltage signal ( root - mean - square amplitude @xmath4 , frequency @xmath5 ) onto the tunnelling voltage and by measuring the current response with a lock - in amplifier .",
    "prior to spectroscopy of monomers and dimers the tip status was monitored using spectra of the onset of the ag(111 ) surface state band edge . to obtain sharp onsets of the surface state signal and to image single adatoms with nearly circular circumference",
    "the tip was controllably indented into the substrate . due to this _ in vacuo _ treatment the tip apex was most likely covered with substrate material .",
    "all scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) images were acquired in the constant current mode with the voltage applied to the sample .",
    "we divided the @xmath3 spectra by @xmath6 to reduce the influence of the voltage - dependent transmission of the tunnelling barrier @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) presents a sequence of constant - current stm images showing a single ag adatom ( top ) on ag(111 ) , two ag adatoms ( middle ) with a distance of @xmath7 , and a silver dimer ( bottom ) .",
    "distances between adatoms of ag - ag assemblies were determined from maxima positions of cross - sectional profiles taken along the connecting line between the adatoms .",
    "together with the orientation of the assembly with respect to high symmetry directions of the ag(111 ) substrate , which was determined from dislocation lines on the surface , the extracted adatom - adatom distances agree with lattice site separations on ag(111 ) .",
    "the ag dimer appears as a single entity in stm images and we assigned the nearest - neighbour distance of ag(111 ) to the adatom - adatom distance of ag@xmath8 .",
    "our calculations indicated a slight preference of the ag adatom to occupy the face - centred cubic ( fcc ) adsorption site to occupation of the metastable hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) adsorption site , which is of the order of the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "we experienced that in the course of fabricating silver dimers individual ag adatoms were also found to occupy hcp adsorption sites [ see the middle stm image in fig.[fig1](a ) and the corresponding sketch in fig.[fig1](b ) ] .",
    "such assemblies occured frequently for adatom distances smaller than @xmath9 . in the following these assemblies",
    "are referred to as quasi - dimers .",
    "the schematics in fig.[fig1](b ) illustrate adsorption sites of individual ag adatoms ( black circles ) on the hosting ag(111 ) lattice ( gray dots ) and the orientation of the quasi - dimer and the dimer with respect to the ag(111 ) crystallographic directions .",
    "figure [ fig1](c ) shows normalized @xmath3 spectra acquired on the centre of the single ag adatom ( top ) , of a quasi - dimer ( middle ) , and of the dimer ( bottom ) .",
    "a gradual shift of the monomer - related peak from @xmath10 via a resonance energy of @xmath11 observed for the quasi - dimer to @xmath12 for the dimer resonance binding energy was observed .",
    "the total shift of @xmath13 toward the fermi level was not induced by the electric field of the tip .",
    "although the tip - surface distances may have differed for the spectra shown in fig.[fig1](c ) , it has been shown in refs.@xcite that for shifts of the order of @xmath14 the tip - surface distance had to be varied by several angstroms , which was not the case here .    , and ag@xmath8 on ag(111 ) ( sample voltage : @xmath15 , tunnelling current : @xmath16 , image size : @xmath17 ) .",

    "the shift of the resonance energy became too small to be resolved .",

    "for @xmath26 the spectra at the centre between two ag adatoms were virtually identical with spectra of clean ag(111 ) in the relevant voltage interval @xcite .",

    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) pw91 by perdew and wang @xcite was applied to the exchange correlation functional .",

    "the potentials for vasp were used from the database @xcite .",
    "all configurations were modelled in a slab geometry comprising of 14 layers of ag .",

    "the surface brillouin zone was sampled with 16 , 9 and 6 @xmath36 points for the @xmath35 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 unit cells , respectively .",
    "the kohn - sham wave functions were expanded in a plane wave basis set with a @xmath37 cutoff energy .    in order to identify the orbital composition of the experimentally observed unoccupied resonance , we have calculated the projected density of states ( pdos ) with respect to atomic orbitals localized at the adatom sites . in case of the silver dimer with both atoms at neighbouring fcc sites",
    ", the maximum of the resonance was found between @xmath38 and @xmath39 above the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "this resonance can clearly be observed in the @xmath40 pdos [ fig.[fig3](a ) ] , while it is absent in the @xmath41 pdos [ fig.[fig3](b ) ] . from this",
    "we conclude a dominant @xmath40 character , with some @xmath41 admixture , of this resonance .     projected density of states ( pdos ) and ( b ) @xmath41 pdos for the silver dimer ( @xmath42 , both adatoms at neighbouring fcc sites ) .",

    "the solid lines are linear fits to the data.,width=321 ]    by projecting onto bonding and antibonding combinations of @xmath40 orbitals located at the two ag atoms of the dimer , we identified the centre of the bonding and antibonding @xmath40 resonance [ fig.[fig3](c ) ] . from this",
    "we obtained the energy splitting between the bonding ( @xmath43 ) and the antibonding ( @xmath44 ) state , whose logarithm is plotted as a function of the mutual ag atom distance in fig.[fig3](d ) .",
    "the results shown in fig.[fig3](d ) are consistent with an exponential variation of @xmath45 within the calculated range of ag adatom distances . in order to compare to experiment , we furthermore calculated the energy shift of the bonding resonance of the ag adatom pair with respect to the energy of the monomer resonance ( @xmath46 ) [ fig.[fig2](b ) ] .",
    "we found that the energy splitting between the bonding resonance with respect to the monomer resonance , @xmath47 , quite accurately coincides with half the energy shift between the bonding and the antibonding states , @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the splitting between bonding and antibonding states is approximately symmetric . the solid line in fig.[fig2](a ) represents a linear fit to @xmath28 as a function of the ag adatom separation @xmath23 , which has been extrapolated to larger separations .",
    "we conclude that both experimental and theoretical data are consistent with an exponential variation of the energy splitting with @xmath23",
    ". however , due to computational limitations the range of ag - ag distances considered here for the two ag adatoms on the ag substrate is too narrow to reliably distinguish between an exponential and an algebraic ( @xmath49 ) @xcite dependence of energy splitting on adatom separation .    for comparison",
    "we have calculated the energy splitting between the @xmath50 bonding and antibonding orbitals of a ag dimer in vacuum .",
    "the calculated splitting of the silver @xmath50 bonding and antibonding orbitals varied exponentially with atom separation as expected @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , as is evident from fig.[fig3](d ) , the energy splitting between bonding and antibonding states for the dimer in vacuum is similar to the splitting of the dimer adsorbed on the surface for the ag - ag distances considered in the _ ab initio _ calculations .    to further analyze the interaction between adatoms on a surface we resorted to a minimum tight - binding model , which is similar to the model reported in ref.@xcite . for simplicity we did not consider a tight - binding model of the fcc crystal and its ( 111 ) surface , but we resorted to atoms with a single @xmath41 orbital forming a simple cubic lattice , and two adatoms adsorbed at on - top sites .",
    "we found a direct contribution , @xmath51 , to the energy splitting between bonding and antibonding states , which is due to direct adatom interaction .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 denotes the transfer integral for the two adatom states , and @xmath51 is identical to the splitting occuring for the free dimer at the same adatom distance .",
    "furthermore , there is a contribution to the splitting owing to the interaction via the substrate , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the next - neighbour transfer integral and @xmath55 the matrix element of the green s function of the substrate with respect to the adsorption sites .",
    "calculations of such a matrix element of the green s function for two next - neighbour sites on the ag(111 ) surface yielded values of @xmath56 varying between @xmath57 and @xmath58 within the energy range of interest . for typical values of @xmath59 between @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    "the simple model also predicts that the interaction via the substrate is distinctly smaller than the observed splitting . at large adatom separations we expect the substrate - mediated interaction to eventually dominate the direct interaction between the adatoms . in case of ag atom pairs on ag(111 ) this appears to occur at a separation which is too large for the splitting to be resolved in experiment .    in a previous investigation of au dimers on nial(110 )",
    "the splitting of bonding and antibonding au dimer states was reported for varying au - au distances @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite found that the variation of the splitting follows a @xmath62 rather than an exponential law .",
    "this observation was argued to be due to the influence of the substrate electronic structure , which reduces the direct overlap of au orbitals . in the case of ag - ag assemblies on ag(111 ) , however , the interaction between the individual ag adatoms is similar to the one in vacuum [ fig.[fig3](d ) ] . a tentative explanation for this observation involves the electronic structures of the substrates .",
    "the ag(111 ) surface exhibits an extended @xmath63 band gap of surface - projected bulk electronic states in the centre of the surface brillouin zone @xcite , while nial(110 ) does not @xcite . since the resonance energy of the ag - ag assemblies falls into the surface - projected @xmath63 band gap it is likely that the ag(111 ) substrate electronic structure plays a less important role in mediating the interaction between the ag adatoms . as a consequence , the ag adatom assemblies on ag(111 )",
    "are subject to a substrate influence to a lesser extent than the au adatom assemblies on nial(110 ) .",
    "we suggest that the large direct interaction in case of ag dimers on ag(111 ) is also caused by the large extension of the @xmath64 wave function , which dominates the resonance .",
    "this results in a slow decay of the transfer integral as a function of ag - ag distance .",
    "the interaction between two ag adatoms on ag(111 ) gives rise to a shift of a @xmath0 resonance toward the fermi level with decreasing mutual adatom distances .",
    "the shift was modelled by density functional calculations and is similar to the shift calculated for a ag dimer in vacuum .",
    "this observation indicates a weak net influence of the substrate on the ag - ag interaction , which may originate from the surface - projected @xmath63 band gap of the substrate .",
    "we suggest that adatom - adatom interactions on surfaces with band gaps in the relevant energy interval exhibit a similar behaviour . as a further reason for the dominating direct interaction we suggest a weak decay of atomic orbitals participating in the interaction .",
