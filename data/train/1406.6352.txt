    "<S> the present cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature and polarization anisotropy data is consistent with not only a power law scalar primordial power spectrum ( pps ) with a small running but also with the scalar pps having very sharp features . </S>",
    "<S> this has motivated inflationary models with such sharp features . recently , even the possibility of having nulls in the power spectrum ( at certain scales ) has been considered . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of these nulls has been shown in linear perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> what shall be the effect of higher order corrections on such nulls ? </S>",
    "<S> inspired by this question , we attempt to calculate quantum radiative corrections to the fourier transform of the two - point function in a toy field theory and address the issue of how these corrections to the power spectrum behave in models in which the tree - level power spectrum has a sharp dip ( but not a null ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider the possibility of the relative enhancement of radiative corrections in a model in which the tree - level spectrum goes through a dip in power at a certain scale . </S>",
    "<S> the mode functions of the field ( whose power spectrum is to be evaluated ) are chosen such that they undergo the kind of dynamics that leads to a sharp dip in the tree level power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> next we consider the situation in which this field has quartic self interactions and find one loop correction in a suitably chosen renormalization scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we thus attempt to answer the following key question in the context of this toy model ( which is as important in the realistic case ) : in the chosen renormalization scheme , can quantum radiative corrections get enhanced relative to tree - level power spectrum at scales at which sharp dips appear in the tree - level spectrum ?    it is a well known fact that the correlations of cmb anisotropies depend not only on the values of various ( late time ) background cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xmath0 , @xmath1 etc ) but also on the assumed form of the pps . </S>",
    "<S> cosmological inflation has been a very actively investigated paradigm for explaining the origin of primordial metric perturbations that lead to anisotropies in cmb sky as well as to the large scale structure of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> there exist models of inflation that give a smooth , nearly scale invariant scalar pps ( with possibly small running of the spectral index ) . </S>",
    "<S> but there also exist models @xcite in which the pps is not so smooth , so has very sharp features . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , at this stage , there is no way to favour models that give smooth ( featureless ) pps with those that do not . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , at this stage , even observationally , it is not possible to favour one of these . in many such theoretical scenarios , </S>",
    "<S> the scalar pps has cuspy dips   that sometimes correspond to a null in the pps i.e. precisely zero scalar power at some wave number . also for a range of modes near such a feature </S>",
    "<S> , the tensor power overtakes scalar power . </S>",
    "<S> such cusp - like dips in scalar pps were reported in the literature but their origin was not satisfactorily understood until recently ( see @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> an exact null in scalar pps can have interesting consequences , such as on processed non - linear matter power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an interesting possibility : since the power spectrum calculation is done perturbatively , and since the leading order answer is too small ( or zero ) at some scale , could the higher order corrections be important at this scale ? if there is no power at some scale , can higher order corrections become so important that they become dominant at this scale ? we attempt to answer such questions in this paper in the context of a toy field theory .    </S>",
    "<S> recall that in cosmological perturbation theory one is concerned with the theory of fluctuations around a background ( inflationary ) solution . </S>",
    "<S> one quantizes these fluctuations and calculates their correlation functions ( on a constant time hyper surface ) using the ( well known ) in - in formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the leading higher order corrections to the two - point function involve the one loop corrections . in the most extreme case of our interest , </S>",
    "<S> the tree - level contribution to the two - point function is zero and the power spectrum at this scale gets generated purely by radiative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the two - point function , @xmath2    ( where the delta function on the rhs is due to spatial homogeneity of the background ) . </S>",
    "<S> the connected part of the quantity @xmath3 , introduced in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g ] ) , can be evaluated perturbatively @xmath4    since the limit @xmath5 recovers the free theory , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mode function which determines the tree level pps . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we will attempt to calculate @xmath8 perturbatively .    to illustrate the effect we are interested in </S>",
    "<S> , we will try to calculate correlation functions in a field theory which mimics the dynamics of comoving curvature perturbation @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we solve for the correlations of a fictitous field @xmath10 with the following ( classical ) action : @xmath11    where we have replaced all occurances of @xmath12 in the action of a test scalar field ( on an expanding unvierse ) by @xmath13 ( here @xmath12 is the scale factor and @xmath14 is the slow - roll parameter ) and the function @xmath15 shall be chosen such that the tree - level power spectrum has sharp features . </S>",
    "<S> the realistic case is quite difficult to deal with , so we have made a few simplifying assumptions . to begin with , </S>",
    "<S> let us assume quartic self interactions of the fluctuation field ( whose power spectrum ( ps ) has a sharp dip at tree level ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the one - loop one - vertex diagram will go as @xmath16 while the one - loop two - vertex diagram will go as @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the comoving curvature perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to realize that the action in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigaction ] ) is not as arbitrary as it may look naively . </S>",
    "<S> when one writes down the fourth - order action for fluctuations ( e.g. comoving curvature perturbation ) , one gets way too many terms ( see e.g. @xcite where this is done without assuming slow - roll approximation for @xmath19 in spatially flat gauge , in this gauge @xmath20 , so we can express the action in terms of @xmath21 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the term with quartic self - interactions is one among many of these terms ( corresponding to the first term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 36 ) of @xcite , notice that the coefficient of quartic term is such that we will get the factor of @xmath22 in the coefficient as is assumed above ) , and we shall be finding out what will happen to the loop corrections to the power spectrum due to this term alone . as a second simplifying assumption , let us attempt the case in which though the tree level ps has a sharp dip , this dip does not lead to a null in the ps . </S>",
    "<S> this will ensure that the one - loop correction is not dominant over the tree level answer , only gets enhanced ( thus perturbation theory will still be valid ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quadratic part of the above action determines the tree level power spectrum and we choose the dynamics of @xmath23 such that the tree level power spectrum has a sharp dip , but not a null ( we choose @xmath23 to take the form in takes in starobinsky model @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> one can canonically quantize such a theory in the usual way . we will be calculating the correlation functions in canonical formalism in an interaction picture in which the time - dependence of the field operators shall be governed by the part of the hamiltonian quadratic in the the field and the field satisfies a linear differential equation . given the mode functions of these free fields , any correlation function can be evaluated .    while evaluating correlation functions at one loop , one encounters ( just like in flat spacetime field theory ) divergences . apart from the usual uv divergences and ir divergences ( the comoving curvature perturbation behaves very much like a massless test field ) , </S>",
    "<S> one also encounters ( extra ) late time divergences . </S>",
    "<S> this is because when we evaluate the two - point function in the in - in formalism ( for an interaction with an even power of field ) we get    @xmath24 |0 \\rangle + \\cdots \\end{split}\\ ] ]    and the contribution when the external time @xmath25 is sent to zero diverges .    due to the presence of the above stated late time divergences , </S>",
    "<S> it is natural that the loop corrections to the correlations can not be kept small . </S>",
    "<S> there is a vast literatue on this subject , attempting to understand the origin and resolution of these divergences . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to understand that this is not the kind of enhancement we are interested in : we are talking about a situation in which the loop correction gets enhanced relative to tree level result because the tree level contribution itself has a sharp dip with very low power . </S>",
    "<S> to get rid of the late time divergences , we shall cut the ( one - loop ) time integral . </S>",
    "<S> the prescription ( which we use ) to do this is that just like the tree level ps , even the loop correction to the power spectrum for the field on de - sitter background is scale invariant .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that if one takes into account all the self interactions of the metric fluctuations ( e.g. the comoving curvature perturbation ) dictated by the symmetries of the problem and evaluates the one loop corrections in such a realistic case carefully , one gets no late time divergences @xcite and the loop integral receives most contributions from times near the time at which the mode is crossing the hubble radius . </S>",
    "<S> so , by putting a cut - off in time integral ( a little after hubble crossing ) in the toy field theory with quartic interactions we are attempting to simulate this .    in renormalized pertrubation theory , </S>",
    "<S> the bare lagrangian ( consisting of bare field , bare mass , bare self coupling and bare ( non - minimal ) coupling to gravity ( @xmath26 ) all of which depend in the uv regulator ) is to be partitioned into a renormalized lagrangian and a counter - term lagrangian , the way this partition is done determines the renormalization scheme choice . for scalar fields , in four dimensions , at one - loop ( and polynomial interactions ) , there is no field strength renormalization . since we wish to keep the field massless and minimally coupled , the physical mass and physical value of @xmath27 should both vanish . unless we are using the so called on - shell ( os ) renormalization scheme , the value of the parameters in the renormalized lagrangian need not be the physical values of those parameters . </S>",
    "<S> one can implement a form of minimal subtraction renormalization scheme in a fairly straighforward way . </S>",
    "<S> one can easily regularize the uv divergences by putting a cut - off in three dimensional momentum space ( and tune the corrections such that the field stays massless ) .    </S>",
    "<S> all this can be easily compared to what happens in the usual flat spacetime field theory . </S>",
    "<S> consider @xmath28 theory in @xmath29 spacetime dimensions ( the theory does nt have a true ground state but perturbation theory does nt `` know '' about it ) . </S>",
    "<S> suppose we evaluate the one - loop corrections to the ( four dimensional fourier transform of ) two - point function in this theory . </S>",
    "<S> we know the tree level answer , which is ( we are using the signature ( -,+,+,+ ) and @xmath30 ) @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> loop corrections are of the order of @xmath32 and if we call @xmath33 to be @xmath34 , then the two - point function ( one - loop ) is    @xmath35\\ ] ]    since we are working with a weakly coupled theory , we could be working with ( say ) @xmath36 and then @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> since the next order correction is supposed to be of the order of @xmath38 , even if @xmath39 becomes fairly large , perturbative calculation shall remain valid . </S>",
    "<S> now we use dimensional regularization and os renormalization scheme to get the function @xmath39 as shown in the left part of fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f6 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> what we are calculating is the equivalent of this for the @xmath10 field . </S>",
    "<S> there exist a small range of modes , near the dip in the tree - level power spectrum , where the tree - level contribution is at its lowest value while the one - loop contribution is not so small , this causes a relative enhancement in the value of @xmath40 w.r.t @xmath41 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f6 ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown for the case in which the value of the parameter @xmath42 of @xcite is @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> as one changes this parameter , the depth of the dip in tree level spectrum can be increased thus increasing the relative size of loop corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we avoid considering cases in which the depth in the dip is too deep because in those cases , the loop correction shall become very large signalling break down of perturbation theory . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we attempted to study how the loop corrections to the correlation functions of cosmological perturbations get affected by the actual dynamics of the mode functions . </S>",
    "<S> we chose the mode functions of the field such that the tree level power spectrum has a sharp dip and we realized that the power spectrum at one loop , renormalized in ms scheme can get enhanced ( at scale near the tree level dip ) relative to the tree level power spectrum .     </S>",
