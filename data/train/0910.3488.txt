    "during recent years important progress has been achieved in understanding the entropy of the so - called small black holes ( for reviews see  @xcite ) which have vanishing horizon area at the supergravity level  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy with the microscopic counting which gives the finite entropy was resolved by the discovery that the area of the horizon is stretched to finite radius once curvature corrections are included .",
    "indeed such corrections have long been known to exist in the low - energy effective theories of superstrings  @xcite .",
    "the classically computed entropy then differs from the bekenstein - hawking value  @xcite , but agrees ( at least up to a coefficient ) with microscopic counting  @xcite including non - bps cases  @xcite . within the models in which the supersymmetric versions of the curvature square terms are available , the correspondence was checked using the exact classical solutions  @xcite .",
    "it was also observed that good agreement is achieved if the curvature corrections are taken in the form of the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term both in 4d and higher dimensions  @xcite .    to compute the entropy of extremal black holes with the horizon @xmath0 from the classical side",
    "it is enough to construct local solutions in the vicinity of the horizon which is easily done analytically  @xcite .",
    "but this does not guarantee the existence of global asymptotically flat solutions .",
    "construction of solutions with curvature corrections , apart from purely perturbative probes  @xcite , requires numerical integration of the field equations . for non - extremal black holes this",
    "was done in  @xcite .",
    "the global existence of extremal black holes in the 4d model with the gb terms endowed with an arbitrary dilaton coupling @xmath2 was proven in  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that global asymptotically flat black holes with the horizon @xmath11 existed for the dilaton coupling below the critical value of the order @xmath12 and less than @xmath13 .",
    "this range does not include the heterotic string value @xmath14 nor @xmath13 .",
    "this result is modified in the presence of the magnetic charge  @xcite , which extends the region of the allowed couplings and serve as the order parameter ensuring continuous transition to the theory without curvature corrections .",
    "it is worth noting that our model has neither continuous nor discrete s - duality , so properties of the purely electric solution essentially differs from that of dyons .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate existence of global solutions for small stretched purely electric black holes in higher dimensional einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory with the gauss - bonnet term ( emdgb ) .",
    "we construct the local solutions in terms of series expansion around the degenerate event horizon for an arbitrary space - time dimension @xmath1 and calculate the discrete sequence of black hole entropies using sen s entropy function approach .",
    "the entropy is found to be monotonically increasing with @xmath1 .",
    "then we continue numerically these local solutions and show that in dimensions higher than four the heterotic string value of the dilaton coupling lies inside the range of the existence of global asymptotically flat static black holes .",
    "we also investigate physical significance of the so - called turning points which were encountered in numerical solutions within the four - dimensional emdgb theory  @xcite .",
    "they correspond to mild singularities at finite radii outside the horizon where metric and its first derivatives are finite , but the second derivatives diverge .",
    "numerical solutions can be extended through these singularities , which we call ` cusps ' in this paper , by suitable redefinition of the integration variable  @xcite . in four dimensions",
    "the solution extended this way then meets a stronger singularity at finite distance , so actually the cusp is just a precursor of the strong singularity . in higher dimensions ( @xmath15 ) we encounter an interesting new feature : the cusps come out in pairs of right and left turning points , so the extended solution finally may be even asymptotically flat .",
    "this could correspond to a novel type of black hole coated by cusp pairs .",
    "but somewhat disappointingly , our analysis shows that continuation of geodesics through the cusp singularities in the extended manifolds can not be performed in a smooth way .",
    "thus we are inclined to reject such extended manifolds as physical black hole solutions .",
    "instead , we interpret the occurrence of cusp singularity as failure to produce asymptotically flat black holes .",
    "this gives an upper bound on the dilaton coupling .",
    "we find numerically the sequence of critical dilaton couplings for @xmath16 which turns out to be increasing with @xmath1 .",
    "another novel feature of emdgb black holes with a degenerate horizon in higher dimensions is that the role of the gb term in the near critical solutions may still be significant . in four dimensions , as was shown in  @xcite , the near - critical solutions saturate the bps bounds of the corresponding theory without curvature corrections .",
    "this means that relative contribution of the gb term becomes negligible when the dilaton coupling approaches its upper boundary .",
    "we find that for @xmath15 this is not so , and the bps conditions are not satisfied in this limit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we define the action , present the field equations in various forms and discuss symmetries of the system . in sec .",
    "iii , we review solutions for small black holes without gb corrections as well and the solutions with the gb term but without dilaton",
    ". then we construct the local series solutions near the horizon and calculate the entropy of stretched black holes using sen s entropy function .",
    "we obtain the discrete sequence of the entropies of curvature corrected black holes in various dimensions interpolating starting with twice the hawking - bekenstein value @xmath17 for @xmath18 up to @xmath19 for @xmath20 . in sec.iv",
    ", we present asymptotic expansions of the desired solutions , introduce global charges and discuss the bps conditions . the next sec .",
    "v is devoted to the cusp problem .",
    "we explain why extension of solutions through the cusp singularity is physically unacceptable . finally in sec .",
    "vi we present numerical results for various dimensions and explore the fulfillment of the bps conditions on the boundary of the allowed dilaton couplings .",
    "a low - energy bosonic effective action for the heterotic string theory with the curvature corrections is given by  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the maxwell field ( we use a truncation involving only one @xmath23 field ) , @xmath24 is the euler density @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the regge slope parameter .",

    ", we do not include these terms in our analysis .",
