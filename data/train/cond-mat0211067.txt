    "in the last few years it has been shown the existence a wide variety of transport processes at the mesoscopic level in which thermal noise plays a decisive role . to understand how those processes work ,",
    "several physical models and technological implementations have been proposed @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the peculiar effect of thermal noise can be illustrated in thermal ratchets or brownian motors , which have the ability of extracting work from out - of - equilibrium fluctuations in spatially periodic systems without spatial inversion symmetry .",
    "one way to do this is by the combination of a ratchet - like potential which rectifies thermal fluctuations , and a periodic unbiased force driving the system out of equilibrium .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to propose a new class of brownian motors able to extract work from thermal fluctuations in nonequilibrium systems driven by a periodic force . unlike the ones previously introduced , the symmetry breaking is due to the presence of a vortex field responsible for the existence of a non - hermitian component in the stochastic dynamics .",
    "fluctuations are then rectified by a non - equilibrium source instead of a ratchet - like potential .",
    "we will call those devices _",
    "vortex ratchets_.    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the stochastic dynamics of these systems .",
    "we formulate the fokker - planck equation and compute the susceptibility . in section 3 , we analyze the dissipation of energy in the system and introduce the ratchet current . section 4",
    "is devoted to discuss some applications",
    "we consider a brownian degree of freedom , parameterized by a coordinate @xmath0 , interacting with a thermal bath which is maintained out of equilibrium by the persisting action of an external drift @xmath1 , @xcite .",
    "this drift could represent , for example , a constant or a quenched velocity field or an external field .",
    "the stochastic dynamics is governed by the probability density @xmath2 satisfying the conservation law    @xmath3    in which the probability current @xmath4 is given by    @xmath5    the dynamics of the brownian degree of freedom is then governed by the fokker - planck equation    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the mobility , @xmath8 the corresponding diffusion coefficient , and @xmath9 a periodic force , with @xmath10 .    in the linear response regime",
    "the formal solution of the fokker - planck equation reads    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the unperturbed fokker - planck operator , and @xmath13 the perturbation .",
    "moreover , @xmath14 corresponds to the stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : f - p ] ) , @xcite .",
    "the presence of the perturbation causes deviation in the coordinate , @xmath15 . to compute that quantity ,",
    "we will expand the term @xmath16 in series of the eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath17 , @xmath18 with eigenvalues @xmath19 ; @xmath20    @xmath21    where @xmath22 are the corresponding coefficients .",
    "we obtain    @xmath23    which defines the susceptibility @xmath24",
    ".    we will assume the existence of a dominant time scale governing the relaxation process , corresponding to the @xmath25 mode in the expansion ( eq : expansion ) .",
    "since the remaining modes decay faster , we can truncate the series retaining only the second term .",
    "thus , considering only contributions of the first mode the susceptibility is given by @xmath26 , with @xmath27 defined as    @xmath28    assuming now @xmath29 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : respuesta ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the fourier transform of @xmath32 given by    @xmath33    with @xmath34 standing for complex conjugate . due to the non - hermitian nature of the operator , the first eigenmode is complex : @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 being its real and imaginary parts , respectively .",
    "the remaining parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : susceptibility ] ) are @xmath38 and the normalized frequency @xmath39 .    in fig . 1",
    ", we show that during the relaxation process of non - equilibrium fluctuations the susceptibility undergoes a resonant behavior when the frequency of the force matches the imaginary part of the first eigenvalue of the non - perturbed operator @xmath40 .",
    "this behavior reveals the existence of a resonant coupling between the periodic force and the non - equilibrium source , responsible for the non - hermitian nature of @xmath40.the implications of that coupling in the energy transduccion of the system will be analyzed in the next section .",
    "systems governed by the non - hermitian dynamics discussed in the previous section may transduce the energy supplied by an unbiased periodic force into kinetic energy , thus inducing a net particle current . to analyze this peculiar behaviour",
    ", we will first calculate the power dissipated by the system . to that purpose",
    "we will apply the scheme of mesoscopic non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite . for a system described by the probability density @xmath2",
    ", the variation of the entropy due to changes in configurations in @xmath41-space is given by    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the chemical potential , @xmath44 the potential , and t the temperature .",
    "the rate of change of the entropy can be obtained by taking the time derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropyvariation ] ) , and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : f - p2 ] ) .",
    "one achieves    @xmath45    the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rateentropy ] ) constitutes the irreversible part of the rate of change of the entropy or entropy production .",
    "consequently , the power supplied by the external force and dissipated into the system is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rateentropy ] ) by using the expression of the chemical potential .",
    "one obtains    @xmath46    which defines the particle current @xmath47 . to obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : externalpower ] ) , we have assumed an homogeneous force and used eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f - p2 ] ) and ( [ eq : current ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath48 can be interpreted as the projection of the particle current along the direction of the oscillating force.the quantity of interest in experiments is the time - averaged dissipated power , defined as    @xmath49    this quantity is not only a function of the imaginary part of the susceptibility as occurs in hermitian systems .",
    "the presence of the external drift introduces a more complicated dependence on the moments of @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , it does not have a definite sign , and in general can be a non - monotonous function of the frequency expressing the resonant character of the energy dissipation .",
    "since in general the external drift @xmath50 introduces a characteristic frequency in the system playing the same role of a vorticity , this systems behaves as a vortex ratchet .",
    "our purpose in this section is to present different manifestations of the vortex ratchet , as well as to indicate potential applications in different fields .      an orientable particle of mesoscopic size in a vortex field under the influence of a periodic force exhibits the phenomenology discussed previously .",
    "in absence of the external force the orientation of the particle is characterized by a director vector undergoing brownian motion which on average rotates at the velocity imposed by the local vorticity , @xmath51 .",
    "the most interesting situation occurs when the force is perpendicular to the vortex field . in that case , if @xmath52 the particle acquires an excess of angular velocity as a consequence of the torque it feels .",
    "in such a situation , the energy supplied by the periodic force is transduced into rotational kinetic energy , thus inducing a net particle current .",
    "this power is given by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the average angular velocity of the particle , and @xmath55 the torque acting on it . in this range of frequencies",
    "the system behaves as a brownian motor .",
    "the director could represent a dipole moment oriented by a field .",
    "suspensions of such dipoles in a liquid phase exhibit peculiar collective behaviours .",
    "this is the case of electro- and magneto - rheological fluids , ferrofluids @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and dilute solution of rod - like polymers @xcite .",
    "the itinerant oscillator model essentially consists of a brownian particle with an orientable core coupled via an interaction potential to the shell .",
    "it was proposed to explain microwave dielectric absorption of polar fluids@xcite .",
    "a particular realization of the model is an inhomogeneous body under the influence of a vortex field and a constant force perpendicular to it .",
    "the inhomogeneity induces a time - dependent dipole moment .",
    "the associated torque is @xmath56 , with @xmath57 being the dipole moment strength , @xmath58 the constant external force , and @xmath59 the orientation vector .",
    "when the dipole moment varies periodically in time , as in the case of the orientable particle , the system behaves as a vortex ratchet . unlike the previous case , variations in the exerted torque are due to internal reorganizations and not to variations of the external field .",
    "the itinerant oscillator model may mimic a living cell with an inhomogeneous density distribution in an external field , a particle in a cage formed by other particles , a rod - like polymer moving in a tube @xcite , or a monodomain magnetic particle whose magnetic moment undergoes fluctuations .",
    "those systems would be good candidates to act as vortex ratchets .",
    "a particle diffusing in a randon media advected by a steady mean - flow velocity @xmath60 in the presence of a periodic force also manifests the ratchet effect previously discussed .",
    "the dynamics of the particle follows from the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq : f - p ] ) , where the drift @xmath50 is now a random velocity distributed around the mean - flow velocity according to a gaussian probability distribution with variance @xmath61 .",
    "the fourier transform of the random drift @xmath62 displays both longitudinal and transversal correlations    @xmath63    the transversal correlations play the role of a vorticity , introducing the non - hermiticity in the dynamics .    assuming that the external force is homogeneous",
    ", the dissipation is obtained through eqs .",
    "( [ eq : externalpower ] ) and ( [ eq : averagepower ] ) , after averaging over the disorder . in fig .",
    "2 , we have represented the normalized dissipated power @xmath64 as a function of the normalized frequency @xmath65 , for two levels of disorder .",
    "these levels are characterized by the parameter @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath68 , with @xmath69 the volume of the system .",
    "the disorder then increases when decreasing @xmath70 .",
    "the figure shows how the contribution of the periodic force to the total dissipated power exhibits a minimum when the frequency matches the characteristic frequency of the system , thus revealing the resonant character of the dissipation . due to the characteristics of this system ,",
    "when the power is negative the particle current is positive .",
    "the figure also shows that the power or , in view of eq .",
    "( [ eq : externalpower ] ) , the current is positive for frequencies around the resonance frequency , which manifests that the velocity of the particles is larger than the average drift .",
    "therefore , in those conditions the system acts as a brownian motor .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs in a spatially periodic two - dimensional pattern of triangular vortexes when a two - dimensional oscillating force is applied , at sufficiently high reynolds number . in this conditions",
    ", a large - scale current appears .",
    "this effect is accompanied by a reduction of the dissipation in the system due to the induction of a negative eddy viscosity@xcite .",
