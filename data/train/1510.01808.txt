    "for example , while the @xmath17 mass distribution in @xmath18  @xcite suggests the existence of the higher - wave baryon , such as @xmath19 or @xmath20 , a peaking data point in the @xmath21 mass distribution in @xmath15  @xcite hints at the resonant @xmath22 state . on the other hand",

    "moreover , since the recent measurements by the lhcb collaboration also indicate this inconsistency  @xcite , it is clear that the values of @xmath34 and @xmath40 can not be experimentally determined yet . in this paper",
    ", we will demonstrate the possible range for @xmath36 in accordance with the measurements by lep , cdf and lhcb collaborations and give the theoretical estimations of @xmath34 and @xmath40 , which allow us to extract @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath41 from the data in eq .",

    "on the other hand , with the charmful @xmath42 and @xmath43 decays , another analysis by the lhcb collaboration presents the exponential dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath46  @xcite : @xmath59 with the wider range of @xmath60 gev . by averaging the value in eq .",

    "we hence make the assumption of @xmath69 to cover the possible range in accordance with the measurements from the three collaborations of lep , cdf and lhcb , which will be used to estimate the values of @xmath34 and @xmath40 in the following .      in principle , when the ratios of @xmath36 and @xmath71 are both known , by adding the relations of  @xcite @xmath72 and @xmath62 as well as @xmath73 due to the isospin symmetry , we can derive the values of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath34 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . for @xmath79 , it was once given that @xmath80 where the first relation from refs .",

    "since the theoretical approach with the factorization ansatz well explains @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and particularly the ratio of @xmath92  @xcite , it can be reliable to determine @xmath70 .",
