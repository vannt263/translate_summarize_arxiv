    "although the afterglows of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) have been studied for 16 years , their complexity and variety has been explored only recently thanks to the rapid location and repointing of the counterparts of grbs by the  satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "the study of grbs at radio frequencies is still poor compared to the wealth of information available at other wavelengths ( x - ray and optical / nir ) .",
    "the most recent extensive study of the radio afterglows of grbs ( chandra & frail 2012 - cf12 hereafter ) collected 304 grbs ( from january 1997 to april 2011 ) that were observed ( between @xmath30.1 and @xmath3300 days ) in the radio bands ( at different frequencies between 600mhz and 660ghz - the 8.4 ghz frequency being the most sampled one ) .",
    "the detections have typical flux densities of 150 - 200 @xmath1jy and the 3@xmath4 upper limits are at the level of 100 - 150@xmath1jy .",
    "the current detection rate ( fraction of grbs detected with respect to observed ) in the radio band is @xmath330% ( cf12 ) , mainly limited by the sensitivity of the radio facilities available until the recent karl g. jansky very large array ( jvla ) .",
    "jvla , which can reach a sensitivity limit of few tens of @xmath1jy for continuous observations at @xmath38.4 ghz , opens the path towards the forthcoming square kilometer array ( ska ) .    despite their paucity",
    ", observations of grbs in the radio band have proved some fundamental properties of these sources : ( 1 ) radio scintillation ( grb 970508  frail et al .",
    "1997 ) showed that the outflow is relativistic ; ( 2 ) the late time ( @xmath3100 d ) flattening of the light curve ( grb 980703 and 000418  frail et al .",
    "2004 ) has been interpreted as the jet becoming non  relativistic ; ( 3 ) late time ( 100450 d after the burst ) radio calorimetry ( grb 030329  frail et al .",
    "2005 , van der horst et al . 2005 , 2008 ; grb 970508 , 980703 ",
    "berger , kulkarni & frail 2004 ) provided an estimate of the total kinetic power of the jet ; ( 4 ) the afterglow spectral energy distribution , obtained by combining optical and radio data , supports the synchrotron origin of the radiation emitted during the afterglow phase ; ( 5 ) radio monitoring of local sn ibc put some constraints on the grb / sn association ( e.g. berger et al .",
    "2003 ) and on the burst beaming factor ( soderberg et al .",
    "2006 ) ; ( 6 ) radio discovery of sn2009bb  like objects ( soderberg et al .",
    "2009 ) can shed light on the transition between normal sne and engine  driven like grb ; ( 7 ) the detection of a few grb hosts ( stanway et al . 2010 ; hatsukade et al .",

    "2012 ) , including the two official ska precursors : askap ( australian ska pathfinder ) and meerkat .",
    "askap ( johnston et al . 2007 , 2008 ;",
    "deboer et al . 2009 ) is a new radio interferometer being built in western australia , and is expected to start operations in 2014 with a limited number of antennas . in its final design , askap will consist of 36 12-m antennas distributed over a region of 6 km in diameter .",
    "each antenna will be equipped with a paf ( phased array feed ) , operating in a frequency band of @xmath5 ghz .",
    "paf technology allows very wide field of views ( @xmath6 deg@xmath7 at 1.4 ghz ) , at the expenses of sensitivity .",
    "this makes askap best suited for wide all  sky surveys , rather than pointed deep integrations .",
    "meerkat ( jonas 2009 ) is the south african ska precursor telescope . it will be constructed in two phases .",
    "meerkat1 ( 2016 ) will consist of 64 13-m antennas distributed over a region of 8 km in diameter .",
    "it will be equipped with single - pixel receivers , operating in a limited frequency range ( @xmath8 ghz ) .",
    "the frequency range will be significantly extended in phase 2 ( meerkat2 , 2018 ) , with operational bands @xmath9 ghz and @xmath10 ghz . for meerkat2 the telescope baselines will be possibly increased up to 16 km , allowing better spatial resolution and consequently deeper integrations .    with a collecting area of about a square kilometre , the ska will be far superior in sensitivity and observing speed to all current radio facilities .",
    "the ska is also designed to be built in two phases ( ska1 and ska2 ) , expected to become fully operational by 2020 and 2025 , respectively . in each phase ska",
    "will consist of three elements : one operating at low frequency , one at intermediate / high frequency , and one optimized for surveys . in the following we focus on ska performance at mid / high frequencies , which are most relevant for this study .",
    "the mid / high frequency band covered by ska1 is @xmath11 ghz , to be extended to 10 ghz in phase 2 ( ska2 ) .",
    "ska1 will consist of 250 15-m antennas distributed in a region of @xmath12 km in diameter .",
    "ska1 is designed to provide factor @xmath13 better sensitivities than meerkat .",
    "ska2 will consist of @xmath14 antennas with an increase in sensitivity of another factor 10 .",

    "1998 ) and the monitoring of the afterglow emission across @xmath46 at different radio frequencies should disentangle among such different interpretations ( e.g. late time energy injection should produce an achromatic light curve flattening ) . if the interstellar medium has a wind density profile ( as it is expected if the progenitor star underwent intense mass loss before its collapse ) , @xmath46 should happen later ( and with a different slope change ) .",

    "@xmath61 estimated from the late time radio observations represents the true grb kinetic energy .    the relevance of estimating @xmath61 is twofold : ( a ) for the grbs with a measured jet opening angle , i.e. those with an estimate of the true prompt emission energy @xmath62 , it is possible to derive a unique estimate of the radiative efficiency @xmath63 and , ( b ) if one assumes a typical efficiency @xmath64 through @xmath61 it is possible do derive an estimate of @xmath65 independent from the collimation angle . this latter possibility would provide a large number of bursts with an estimate of @xmath65 to be added to the @xmath66 correlation ( ghirlanda et al .",

    "<S> radio observations of gamma ray bursts afterglows are fundamental in providing insights into their physics and environment , and in constraining the true energetics of these sources . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , radio observations of grb afterglows are presently sparse in the time / frequency domain . </S>",
    "<S> starting from a complete sample of 58 bright  long bursts ( bat6 ) , we constructed a homogeneous sub  sample of 38 radio detections / upper limits which preserves all the properties of the parent sample . </S>",
    "<S> one half of the bursts have detections between 1 and 5 days after the explosion with typical fluxes @xmath0100 @xmath1jy at 8.4 ghz . through a population synthesis code </S>",
    "<S> coupled with the standard afterglow hydrodynamical emission model ( psyche ) we reproduce the radio flux distribution of the radio sub  sample . </S>",
    "<S> based on these results we study the detectability in the time / frequency domain of the entire long grb population by present and future radio facilities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the grbs that typically trigger  can be detected at 8.4 ghz by jvla within few days with modest exposures even at high redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the final ska can potentially observe the whole grb population provided that there will be a dedicated grb @xmath2ray detector more sensitive than . </S>",
    "<S> for a sizable fraction ( 50% ) of these bursts , ska will allow us to perform radio  calorimetry , after the trans  relativistic transition ( occurring @xmath3100 d ) , providing an estimate of the true ( collimation corrected ) energetics of grbs .    </S>",
