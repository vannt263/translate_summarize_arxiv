    "the solar wind is an excellent natural laboratory for the _ in situ _ study of space plasma turbulence  @xcite . due to the relatively weak density fluctuations ( @xmath0 ) , fast solar wind ( fsw ) turbulence",
    "is often described at low frequencies ( @xmath1hz ) by incompressible magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd )  @xcite .",
    "the pioneering works  @xcite included attempts to understand the origin and the nature of the density fluctuations , as well as their spectral laws . a kolmogorov  like @xmath2 spectrum for the density fluctuations led to the conclusion that the density acts as a passive scalar in the solar wind .",
    "a direct evidence of the presence of an inertial energy cascade in the solar wind was observed using the so - called yaglom law @xcite .",
    "it is a universal law derived analytically from the incompressible mhd equations @xcite ( hereafter pp98 ) under the assumptions of homogeneity , stationarity and isotropy of the turbulent fluctuations .",
    "later , a first attempt was made to include the compressibility using a heuristic model @xcite ( hereafter c09 ) .",
    "the application of c09 to fsw turbulence showed a better scaling relation of the energy flux than with pp98 .",
    "furthermore , a significant increase of the turbulent cascade rate was evidenced and was shown to be sufficient to account for the local heating of the non - adiabatic solar wind expansion @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we present for the first time a statistical study of scaling properties of fsw turbulence derived recently by @xcite ( hereafter bg13 ) for compressible isothermal mhd turbulence ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our findings show the new role played by the compressible fluctuations in the turbulent cascade and the local heating of the fsw .",
    "in the course of this letter , we shall compare two solar wind turbulent mhd models , namely the incompressible pp98 and the compressible isothermal bg13 exact laws . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we recall their different relationships written for the dissipation rate of the total energy .

    ". note that in s.i .",
    "units , we have the relation @xmath14 .    [ [ compressible - model ] ] * compressible model * : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the exact law bg13 can schematically be written as - 4 _ c = _ _ c - + s , [ bg13relation ] where @xmath15 denotes the dissipation rate of the total compressible energy",
    ". the flux term writes _ c & = + [ equ4 ] + & + 2 e + 2 ( e + v_a^2 2 ) ( _ 1 ) , where by definition @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the internal energy ( @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the constant isothermal sound speed , @xmath20 the mean density and @xmath21 ) .",
    "note that @xmath22 reduces to @xmath23 when @xmath24 ( implying also that @xmath25 ) .",
    "furthermore , we have [ equ5 ] =  ( e ) + 1 (   e ) , where the primed and unprimed variables correspond to the variables at points @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively and @xmath28 gives the local ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure ( note the difference between the definition of @xmath29 used here and in @xcite )",
    ". the last term @xmath30 is a source term that includes the local divergences of @xmath4 and @xmath31 .",
    "the main goal of this study is to evaluate for the first time the compressible effects in solar wind turbulence with an exact law .",
    "this objective will be partly achieved by evaluating the first two terms in the right hand side of equation ( [ bg13relation ] ) .",
    "the source term will be left aside because a reliable evaluation of local velocity divergences is not possible using single spacecraft data .",
    "thus , we implicitly assume that @xmath30 is subdominant .",
    "note that this situation , not proved for the solar wind , is well observed numerically in supersonic hd turbulence @xcite and in a preliminary study using numerical simulations of isothermal mhd turblence @xcite .",
    "we may try to estimate @xmath32 , which is not a pure flux term but can be reduced to it , if the . in this particular case , we obtain after simple manipulations = 1 _ e -   e = - 2 _ . this term can now be merged with the flux terms in equation  ( [ equ4 ] ) .",
    "this results in modifying the last term of @xmath22 from @xmath33 to @xmath34 \\delta ( \\rho_1 \\vv)}$ ] . as a last step",
    ", one can integrate relation  ( [ bg13relation ] ) over a ball of radius @xmath10 and get the equivalent of the isotropic relation ( [ pp98a ] ) for isothermal compressible mhd turbulence , namely -4 3 _ c = f_c+ ( ) , [ bg13reduced ] where _ c+ ( ) = f_1 ( ) + f_2()+f_3 ( ) , and _ 1 ( ) & = & + , + f_2()&= & 2 e v _ , + f_3()&= & 2 ( _ 1 v _ ) .",
    "[ fcphi ] equations  ( [ bg13reduced])([fcphi ] ) will be evaluated using spacecraft data in the fsw .",
    "it is worth noting that the condition of @xmath29 used to obtain the new form of @xmath35 in equations  ( [ fcphi ] ) is a stringent requirement in selecting the data used in the present study .",
    "we used the themis b / artemis p1 spacecraft data during time intervals when it was travelling in the free - streaming solar wind .",
    "in particular , we used the plasma moments and magnetic field data which were measured respectively by the electrostatic analyzer ( esa ) and the flux gate magnetometer ( fgm ) with a time resolution of 3 seconds ( i.e. , spin period ) .",
    "since we are interested in fsw , between 2008 and 2011 for which @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the solar wind speed .",
    "furthermore , we have tried as much as possible to avoid data intervals that contained significant ecliptic disturbances , such as coronal mass ejection or interplanetary shocks . besides these criteria",
    ", we paid a particular attention to choosing only intervals that showed relatively stationary plasma @xmath29 and @xmath38 , the angle between the local solar wind speed @xmath39 and the magnetic field @xmath40 .",
    "the stationarity of the plasma @xmath29 is imposed to fulfill the condition used to derive equations  ( [ bg13reduced])([fcphi ] ) , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the stationarity of the angle @xmath38 is required to guarantee that the spacecraft is sampling nearly the same direction of space with respect to the local magnetic field ( when the taylor hypothesis , @xmath41 , is used ) , which would ensure a better convergence in estimating the cascade rate .",
    "indeed , if the angle @xmath38 changes significantly in a single time interval ( e.g. , from @xmath42 to @xmath43 ) , this means that the analysis would mix between the two cascade rates estimated along the direction parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field , known to be very different .",
    "this is based on anisotropic mhd turbulence models and on spacecraft observations in the solar wind  @xcite ( this point will be discussed in more detail in an upcoming paper ) .",
    "the obtained intervals that fulfilled all the previous criteria were divided into a series of samples of equal duration @xmath44mn , which corresponds to @xmath45 data points with a @xmath46s time resolution .",
    "this sample size is much larger than those used in previous studies based on ace spacecract data that had a time resolution of @xmath47s ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the sample size of @xmath48mn ensures having at least one correlation time of the turbulent fluctuations estimated to vary in the range @xmath49mn .",
    "the data selection yielded 170 samples and a total number of data points @xmath50 .",

    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 separately . note that the flux @xmath65 can be seen as the generalization to the compressible case of the pp98 flux since it converges to it in the incompressible limit .",
    "for that reason we call it the yaglom flux .",
    "we clearly see that the main contribution comes from the new pure compressible fluxes @xmath66 and @xmath67 with up to an order of magnitude of difference with @xmath65 .",
    "these results are confirmed in the statistical survey of all the samples .",
    "figure  [ histogram_epsilon ] ( right ) compares the ratio between the estimated cascades rates from the pp98 and the bg13 models .",
    "it is interesting to note that , while the compressible and incompressible models converge toward the same value of the cascade rate for most of the events , some cases show that the compressible rate is a few times larger than the incompressible one .",
    "these ratios remain however smaller than those reported in  @xcite ( this point will be discussed elsewhere ) .",
    "the absolute values of the compressible cascade rate @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "[ histogram_epsilon ]  left ) shows some spread around the mean value @xmath69jm@xmath63s@xmath64 .",
    "more insight is gained when analyzing statistically the contribution of the different compressible fluxes , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , relative to the incompressible ( yaglom ) flux @xmath23 .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ epsilon_2d ] .",
    "a first observation is that most of the samples have their compressible yaglom flux ( @xmath65 ) of the order of the incompressible flux ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this confirms the previous result that the density fluctuations entering into the compressible yaglom flux does not play a leading role in amplifying the compressible cascade rate w.r.t .",
    "the incompressible one .",
    "this role is rather played by the new compressible fluxes @xmath66 and @xmath67 : high values of @xmath70 ( up to @xmath71 ) are observed when @xmath72 .",
    "although a similar amplification has been reported in  @xcite , given by an heuristic modification of the incompressible ( yaglom ) term _ via _ density fluctuations , the one observed here has a totally different origin : it is essentially due to the pure compressible terms @xmath66 and @xmath67 derived in the exact model of bg13 .",
    "note finally that the highest ratio @xmath73 ( i.e. , highest amplification of the cascade rate due to compressible fluctuations ) is observed in the top - right quarter of figure  [ epsilon_2d ] , which corresponds to the cases when all the three terms @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 dominate over the incompressible ( yaglom ) term @xmath23 .",
    "unlike the incompressible pp98 model , the compressible flux obtained from bg13 model gives a uniform value of @xmath15 estimated above over two decades of scales , thereby assuring a physical cascade process in fast solar wind turbulence .",
    "using the heuristic model , @xcite found intervals for which either the inward or the outward flux scales linearly with the fluctuation scale . this problem has been overcome in the current study by using the flux of total energy which is an inviscid invariant of compressible mhd turbulence unlike the inward / outward flux separately .",
    "the turbulent cascade implies a forward flux of energy which ultimately will be converted at small - scales into heating by some kinetic processes  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using a simple power law model @xcite , we may obtain an estimate for the energy needed to heat up the fast solar wind at 1 au . for a power - law of type @xmath74 , with @xmath75",
    "the proton temperature and @xmath76 the heliocentric distance , the model can be written as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the energy flux rate ( per unit mass ) . using the average flow velocity @xmath37 and temperature t for all the statistical events , with the value @xmath79 ( corresponding to the upper bound of the estimated temperature using ulysses data @xcite ) we estimated @xmath80 .",
    "this value is of the order of the estimated energy cascade rate from bg13 model , @xmath81 ( using un average density @xmath82 ) , and also is in agreement with the finding of @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the current study , a considerably low incompressible flux ( @xmath83 times smaller than the compressible flux ) is reported in @xcite which can possibly be assigned to the absence of large scale drivers in the high latitude solar wind during solar minimum @xcite .",
    "however , this model can be improved in the future by using polytropic closure  @xcite , the local anisotropy of the turbulence which is known to be important  @xcite .",
    "previous studies  @xcite have indeed shown that the heating is smaller in the parallel direction than in the perpendicular one , the latter being comparable however to the isotropic heating . a simple observational approach to account for anistropy would be to examine the dependence of the compressible cascade rate on the angle @xmath38 .",
    "a more complete approach would consist in splitting into two parts the flux term in equation ( [ bg13relation ] ) by assuming cylindrical isotropy around the local mean magnetic field direction .",
    "these problems will be investigated in a forthcoming paper where a detailed study of the nature of the cascade ( direct _ vs _ inverse , inward _ vs _",
    "outward ) and a comparison between the fast and slow solar winds will be made ( hadid et al .",
