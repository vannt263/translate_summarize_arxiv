    "although qcd is well established as the theory of strong interactions , the fact that its coupling becomes large at energies below 1 - 2 gev keeps the hadronic realm beyond the reach of perturbative calculations . in that regime ,",
    "lattice methods are a useful tool to calculate qcd observables , although the discretization involved in this technique introduces complications of its own , in particular related to chiral symmetry breaking and the implementation of realistic small masses for the light quarks . despite the remarkable success of lattice studies , results on light meson resonances are few and usually obtained at very large quark masses compared with their physical values @xcite .",
    "this is particularly so for the light scalars , very relevant for nuclear attraction , but whose calculations are hindered by the so called `` disconnected diagrams '' .",
    "very recently @xcite , an alternative technique , based on chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) and dispersion relations , has been applied to calculate the dependence of the @xmath0 ( or `` sigma '' ) and @xmath2 resonances on the pion mass  in practice , the average mass of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks . now the starting parameters are physical and resonances appear in amplitudes that describe real data on @xmath6 scattering .",
    "the predicted dependence for the @xmath2 compares remarkably well with previous and later lattice predictions . for the scalar sigma it shows a non - analyticity that should be taken into account when extrapolating future lattice data to physical values . in this work",
    "we extend this study to include the strange quark mass within an su(3 ) chpt formalism .",
    "our aim is threefold : first , to confirm previous results within a more general formalism .",
    "second , to analyze the dependence on the average mass of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks of the @xmath3 and @xmath1 strange resonances .",
    "the latter , despite being a scalar , and very similar to the @xmath0 , is much more feasible for lattice calculations within the next few years @xcite due to its nonzero isospin and strangeness .",
    "third , we also study the dependence of all the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters in terms of the strange quark mass .",
    "finally , let us remark that the dependence of hadronic observables , meson masses in particular , is not only of relevance for lattice calculations , but also for anthropic considerations @xcite or the study of the cosmological variability of fundamental constants @xcite .",
    "thus , in the next two subsections we introduce very briefly the basic notation of chpt , explain the relation between pseudoscalar meson and quark masses , and review the unitarization procedure . in section",
    "ii , we show the fits to the existing experimental data on elastic scattering as well as to lattice results on pion and kaon masses , their decay constants , and scattering lengths on the highest isospin channels .",
    "section iii is devoted to the dependence of light resonance properties on the non - strange quark masses . in section",
    "iv we then study the dependence with the strange quark mass and in section v we present our summary and conclusions .",
    "as is well known , pions , kaons and etas can be identified with the nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngb ) of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of qcd .",
    "if quarks were massless , so should be the ngb and they would be separated by a mass gap of the order of 1 gev from other hadrons , thus becoming the only relevant qcd degrees of freedom at low energies .",
    "of course , quarks are not massless , but the @xmath7 and @xmath8 flavors have a sufficiently light mass to be considered as a perturbation .",
    "it is thus possible to write a low energy effective lagrangian out of pion , kaon and eta fields , known as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt)@xcite . this lagrangian is built as the most general derivative and mass expansion that respects the symmetries of qcd , particularly its chiral symmetry breaking pattern . except for the leading order , fixed by symmetry and the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking , all terms in the lagrangian",
    "are multiplied by a low energy constant ( lec ) that contains the information on the underlying qcd dynamics and also renormalizes the loop diagrams with vertices from lower orders . in this way ,",
    "pion , kaon and eta observables are obtained as a _ model independent _ expansion in powers of momenta and masses over the chiral scale @xmath9gev , where @xmath10 is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit ( as it is customary , for quantities at leading order in the quark mass expansion we will use the 0 subscript ) .",
    "in particular , partial wave amplitudes for elastic meson - meson scattering are obtained within chpt as an expansion @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes either momenta or meson masses .",
    "actually , these partial waves carry definite isospin @xmath13 and total angular momentum @xmath14 , but we have momentarily suppressed these labels for clarity .",
    "as we have just commented , the leading order @xmath15 corresponds to the current algebra results and only depends on the scale of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xmath10 .",
    "the next to leading order @xmath16 contains one - loop diagrams made of vertices from the lowest order lagrangian , plus tree level diagrams of @xmath17 . within the su(3 )",
    "formalism , these tree level diagrams are multiplied by lecs , denoted as @xmath18 , which are independent of masses or momenta , and have been determined from different experiments . in table",
    "[ tab : lecs ] we provide several sets for the eight @xmath18 that appear in meson - meson scattering to one loop .",
    "those with an `` r '' superscript carry a dependence on the regularization scale @xmath19 @xcite , customarily chosen at @xmath20 .",
    "of course , that scale dependence cancels in the calculation of physical observables .",
    "the values in the second column come from the `` main fit '' of a @xmath21 analysis to two loops @xcite , whereas those in the third column come from the same reference , but to one loop .",
    "naively one would expect the lecs obtained in our unitarized one - loop fits to lie somewhere in between these two sets of values , since unitarization reproduces one of the most relevant numerical contributions from the two - loop calculation , namely the s - channel leading logs .",
    "as one of our main interests is @xmath22 scattering and the @xmath3 and @xmath1 resonances , we also provide the values obtained from a very rigorous treatment of @xmath23 scattering lengths in terms the roy - steiner dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "the rest of the columns correspond to unitarized chpt fits that we will explain in sect.[sec : fits ]    .[tab : lecs]@xmath17 chiral parameters ( @xmath24 ) evaluated at @xmath20 .",
    "the second and third columns come from the two and one loop analysis listed in @xcite , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 were set equal to zero .",
    "the fourth column comes from a careful @xmath22 dispersive analysis @xcite using the roy - steiner formalism .",
    "the iamiii column is one of the sets obtained from an older fit with the coupled channel iam @xcite ( only statistical uncertainties are shown ) .",
    "the columns labeled fit i and fit ii correspond to the simultaneous fit to experiment and lattice data performed in this work , which are described in sec.[sec : fits ] together with their uncertainties . [",

    "chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by these mass terms and the ngb acquire masses , which , at leading order , read @xcite : @xmath29 let us recall that the constant @xmath30 is defined from the values _ in the chiral limit _ of the chiral condensate and the pion decay constant as follows : @xmath31 .",

    "to get rid of the @xmath30 constant , we will recast all our results in terms of masses normalized to their physical values : @xmath36 note that , from now on , a quantity with a `` phys '' subscript refers to the value of that quantity in the physical case .",
    "thus , in this work we will change quark masses , that , using eqs . , and , imply a change in meson masses , which are the ones appearing explicitly in the chpt scattering amplitudes .",
    "top : the ratio @xmath37 bottom : @xmath38 . within the range of variation of this work , a relative variation of a quark mass",
    "can be also understood as the same relative variation in the corresponding meson mass squared to within @xmath39 accuracy .",
    "the continuous and dashed lines correspond to fit i and ii sets of lecs given in table  [ tab : lecs ] . ]",
    "there are many advantages in using meson masses as the variation parameter , since , contrary to quark masses that have a complicated and scale dependent definition on the qcd renormalization scheme , meson masses are observables , with no scale dependence and a straightforward physical interpretation .",
    "actually , many lattice results are also recast in terms of pion or kaon mass variations . unfortunately the simple relations in eqs . and",
    "are exact only when written in terms of the leading order masses @xmath40 , not the observable ones . nevertheless , the one - loop corrections become numerically small when taking ratios so that , to a good degree of approximation , the reader still can think in terms of physical meson masses instead of their leading order values .",
    "actually , in fig.[fig : masses ] we show that within the range of quark mass variations that we will consider in this work , the naive , but intuitive , relations @xmath41 are a very good approximation  within less than 10% error to the correct ratios in eqs.([eq : mhatratio0 ] ) and ( [ eq : msratio0 ] ) , that we actually use . to make our presentation of the results more intuitive we will give , when possible",
    ", our results both in terms of quark mass variation and the corresponding meson mass variation .    at this point",
    "we have to address the question of how much we can vary the quark masses before our approach breaks down .",
    "first we want the pion always lighter than the kaon and eta since otherwise the elastic approximation would make no sense for @xmath6 or @xmath23 scattering .",
    "second , chpt seems to work for masses as high as 500 mev , since we already know that it provides a fairly good description of low energy @xmath42 scattering , even though @xmath43 .",
    "thus , when changing the non strange quark mass , keeping @xmath44 fixed , we will show results up to @xmath45 but not beyond , since then @xmath46 .",
    "equivalently , this means @xmath47 . concerning the strange quark variation with @xmath48 fixed , we will consider @xmath49 , since @xmath50 barely changes and @xmath51 .",
    "this ensures that the @xmath52 is not below the @xmath53 mass so that we would need a coupled channel formalism .",
    "of course , the closer to the estimated applicability limits the less reliable our formalism will be .",
    "the su(3 ) @xmath6 and @xmath23 one - loop amplitudes were first calculated in @xcite , although for technical reasons explained in @xcite needed for the implementation of exact unitarity later on , we use the expressions in the appendix of @xcite , but written in terms of all physical constants @xmath54 , @xmath55 as explained in @xcite . for completeness",

    "consequently , the lecs that play the most important role are @xmath60 and @xmath61 , since they appear in lagrangian terms that contain explicitly powers of the quark mass matrix .",
    "in contrast , the lagrangian terms proportional to the @xmath62 and @xmath63 constants only contain derivatives and thus are somewhat less relevant for the quark mass dependence , but more relevant in terms of @xmath8 dependence .",
    "finally , let us remark that despite the fact that their effect is encoded in the lecs , the chpt amplitudes , being an expansion , can not describe resonances and their associated poles in the second riemann sheet .",
    "actually , resonances are usually identified with a saturation of the unitarity constraints , which for elastic partial waves of definite isospin @xmath13 and angular momentum @xmath14 read : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the center of mass momentum .",
    "the above equations imply that the partial wave can be recast in terms of a single phase or `` phase shift '' : @xmath67 in this work we are only interested in the @xmath68 and @xmath69 channels for @xmath6 scattering and @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath22 scattering . for simplicity we will drop the @xmath72 subindex when discussing general properties of elastic partial waves .",
    "note , however , that the chpt expansion eq",
    ". , being basically a polynomial in energy , violates the bound in eq . as the energy increases and",
    "can not generate poles .",
    "still , chpt satisfies elastic unitarity perturbatively : @xmath73 but , of course , elastic unitarity can be badly violated if the chpt series is extrapolated close to a resonance . for these reasons ,",
    "the resonance region lies beyond the reach of standard chpt .",
    "however , we will see next that chpt can be used in an alternative way .      instead of simply extrapolating its series to higher energies",
    ", chpt can be used to calculate the subtraction constants of a dispersion relation for the two - body amplitude .",
    "these constants correspond to the values of the amplitude or its derivatives at a low energy point where the use of chpt is well justified . the remaining information to build the amplitude comes from the strong constraints of analyticity and unitarity .",
    "first of all , it is straightforward to rewrite the strong non - linear elastic unitarity constraint given in eq .",
    ", as follows @xmath74 this means that , from unitarity , we know _ exactly _ the imaginary part of @xmath75 in the elastic region . we are only left to determine the real part of @xmath75 .",
    "concerning the analyticity constraints , for simplicity let us consider first the case of two identical particles , as in @xmath6 scattering .",
    "then , the analytic structure in the complex @xmath8 plane is rather simple : it has a `` right '' or `` physical '' cut on the real axis from threshold to @xmath76 , and a `` left cut '' from @xmath77 to @xmath78 . by means of the cauchy theorem , a dispersion relation provides the amplitude anywhere inside the cut complex plane in terms of a weighted integral of its imaginary part over the cuts .    in our case , instead of @xmath79 we are interested in a dispersion relation for @xmath75 since we know",
    "exactly its imaginary part in the elastic region thanks to eq .. for convenience , and since @xmath80 is real , instead of @xmath75 we define @xmath81 , that also has a right cut ( @xmath82 ) and a left cut ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "since scalar waves are known to have dynamical adler zeros in the low energy region below threshold , we will also allow for a pole contribution @xmath84 in @xmath85 .",
    "all in all , we can write a dispersion relation for @xmath85 as follows @xmath86 in the elastic region , unitarity in eq . , together with eq .",
    ", allow us to evaluate _ exactly",
    "_ @xmath87 on the @xmath82 .",
    "note the three @xmath88 factors  called subtractions  that we have introduced to suppress the high energy part and in particular the inelastic contributions , so that the integrals are dominated by the low energy region .",
    "but once the integrals are dominated by the low energy , it is well justified to use chpt inside the integrals and thus , for instance , the @xmath83 integral to one loop chpt is given by @xmath89 .",
    "the price to pay for the three subtractions is that analyticity only determines the function up to a second order polynomial @xmath90 .",
    "however , note that its coefficients correspond to the values of the amplitude or its derivatives at @xmath78 , where chpt can be safely applied . in particular , to one - loop , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , since @xmath94 vanishes .",
    "let us neglect for the moment the pole contribution , which is of higher order and only numerically relevant below threshold .",
    "then one finds that all contributions can be recast in terms of the leading @xmath15 and next to leading @xmath16 chpt amplitudes .",
    "finally , we arrive at the so - called inverse amplitude method ( iam ) @xcite : @xmath95 remarkably , this simple equation ensures elastic unitarity , matches chpt at low energies , and , using lecs compatible with existing determinations , describes fairly well data up to somewhat less than 1 gev , generating the @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 resonances as poles on the second riemann sheet .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the scalars can actually be generated mimicking the lec , tadpole and crossed channel diagrams by a cutoff of natural size , and thus it is said that scalars are `` dynamically generated '' from , essentially , meson - meson dynamics ( meson loops ) .",
    "in contrast , to generate the vectors , a precise knowledge of the lecs is needed , namely , of the underlying , non meson - meson qcd dynamics .    here",
    "we will update this description of experimental data but furthermore we will simultaneously describe the existing lattice results for decay constants and some scattering lengths .",
    "the iam equation above is just the one - loop result , but it can be easily and systematically extended to higher orders of chpt or generalized within a coupled channel formalism @xcite , generating also the @xmath100 , @xmath101 and the octet @xmath102 .",
    "however note that there is no dispersive justification for the coupled channel approach formula and that is the main reason , apart from simplicity , why we have restricted our analysis to the elastic case .    for completeness , and even though it will be negligible except for very high masses near the applicability limits of our approach ,",
    "let us now include the pole contribution @xmath84 ignored so far .",
    "its contribution can be calculated explicitly from its residue @xcite and , to one - loop , we find a modified iam ( miam ) formula : @xmath103}{s{-}s_a},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 is the position of the adler zero in the @xmath8-plane , and @xmath105 its lo approximation .",
    "the standard iam is recovered for @xmath106 , which holds exactly for all partial waves except the scalar ones . above , and in the usual iam derivation @xcite @xmath107",
    "was neglected , since it formally yields a nnlo contribution and is numerically very small , except near the adler zero , where it diverges . however",
    ", if @xmath107 is neglected , the iam adler zero occurs at @xmath105 , correct only to lo , it is a double zero instead of a simple one , and a spurious pole of the amplitude appears close to the adler zero .",
    "all of these caveats are removed with the miam , eq .  .",
    "the differences in the physical and resonance region between the iam and the miam are less than 1% . however",
    ", as we will see , for large @xmath50 the @xmath98 and @xmath99 poles `` split '' into two virtual poles below threshold , one of them moving towards zero and approaching the adler zero region , where the iam fails .",
    "thus , we will use for our calculations the miam , although it is only relevant for the mentioned second @xmath98 and @xmath99 poles , and only when they are very close to their corresponding adler zeros .",
    "finally , we want to comment on the unequal mass case , since we also want to describe @xmath23 elastic scattering .",
    "the main difference now is that the left cut extends from @xmath77 to @xmath108 , and also that there is a circular cut , centered at @xmath78 with radius @xmath109 .",
    "again their main contribution comes from a region where chpt can be applied .",
    "this time , however , @xmath15 has _ two _ zeros instead of one , @xmath110 , and the modification to the iam reads :    @xmath111 . \\label{aangelpik}\\ ] ]    once again we note that this modification will be numerically negligible except in the close vicinity of the adler zero .",
    "the poles of the resonances under study will only come close to that region for very high values of the quark masses , in the limit of applicability of chpt and our approach .    before describing our fits , we want to remark that , in the iam derivation above , chpt does not play any role outside its applicability limits . by including three subtractions",
    "we have suppressed strongly all contributions to the integrals in high energy regions where chpt results are not reliable . finally , the three subtraction constants , which correspond to values of the amplitudes or their derivatives at @xmath78 are well calculated with chpt .",
    "of course , this is just a one - loop calculation , although the generalization to higher orders is tedious but straightforward .",
    "hence , our approach does not model the left or inelastic cuts , but just uses the corresponding chpt approximation that , in principle , can be improved order by order  eventually including more subtractions .",
    "as commented before , it has been known for long @xcite that with the one - loop elastic iam ( the miam is almost identical ) in eq .",
    "it is possible to obtain a remarkable description of @xmath6 and @xmath23 experimental data up to somewhere below 1 gev .",
    "simultaneously , the iam generates the poles associated to the @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 resonances and this is achieved using parameters compatible with those of standard chpt @xcite .",
    "however , that description was obtained from a fit to experimental data , and therefore it is mostly sensitive to the lecs @xmath112 that predominantly govern the @xmath8 dependence of partial waves , but much less so to the rest of lecs that carry an explicit meson mass dependence . of course",
    ", since now we want to extrapolate the iam fits to non - physical masses , it is very important that we use a good description of the mass dependence in observables like masses , decay constants , etc . before extracting conclusions about resonance behavior . for that reason",
    ", we are presenting here an updated iam description of experimental data simultaneously fitted to the available lattice results on the mass dependence of @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 as well as scattering lengths for the doubly charged channel in @xmath6 , @xmath23 and @xmath116 scattering .",
    "note that for the moment , these lattice data are only available in the highest isospin combination for each particle pair .    in order to change the masses and decay constants according to eqs .",
    ", , and , we need first to extract the tree level quantities : @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath10 from the physical values of the pion , kaon and eta masses as well as the three decay constants @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "note that @xmath121 will be obtained from the gell - mann - okubo relation : @xmath122 . since there are more physical values than tree level constants , for a given set of lecs we actually use the tree level constants that best fit the physical ones .",
    "thus , the physical masses and decay constants that we will obtain when recovering them from the tree level ones will be only approximate .",
    "this is , of course , the consequence of using a truncated expansion ",
    "chpt to one - loop  to describe observables .",
    "we have made two fits whose resulting lecs sets are given in the two last columns of table  [ tab : lecs ] .",
    "since there are many parameters , there are strong correlations .",
    "thus , sets with quite different parameters can give raise to acceptable descriptions of data , depending on how one weights experiment and lattice results .",
    "on fit i we have fitted to experimental data coming from @xcite and to lattice results given in @xcite .",
    "we show in fig.1 these data , for the @xmath123 and @xmath69 waves , where many different experiments are actually incompatible , but we have fitted to the phase shifts arising from the dispersive analysis of the experimental data in @xcite , where a complete set of forward dispersion relations and roy eqs .",
    "was constrained on a phenomenological fit to all waves . for the @xmath124 wave we have used also the phenomenological phase shifts from that solution since , apart from the dispersive constraints",
    ", it fits the data of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion , which is much more reliable and precise than the existing experiments on @xmath124 pion - pion scattering . anyway , since for @xmath22 and other waves we are still using scattering , and also because the method has an intrinsic error due to the nlo approximation on the integrals , we have added in quadrature to the experimental data errors a constant error of 2 degrees and a variable error of 5% of the phase shift and to lattice results on masses over decay constants 5% of their values also in quadrature to their errors .",
    "we have also introduced a constraint so that the lecs do nt differ much from those found in the @xmath21 analysis to two loops of @xcite , by weighting also in the @xmath125 the lecs with the values in @xcite . on fit ii",
    "we have given an additional weight to the large @xmath126 constraint @xmath127 ( dividing its error by 10 when calculating the @xmath125 ) whereas we have relaxed the constrains on @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( dividing their @xmath125 by @xmath130 ) .",
    "for comparison , also in table  [ tab : lecs ] we provide three typical sets of lecs available in the literature obtained from data analyses using dispersive techniques plus chpt .",
    "those on the first and the second columns , come from a one and two - loop analysis of @xmath21 decays @xcite , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 were set equal to zero ( following leading order @xmath126 arguments ) .",
    "the `` roy - steiner '' column comes from a dispersive analysis of @xmath22 scattering @xcite .",
    "note that the lecs in these sets are frequently within more than two standard deviations from one another , and we consider that their difference is indicative of the typical size of systematic uncertainties in our knowledge of lecs . as commented above , since the one - loop iam generates correctly only the s - channel leading logs of the two - loop calculation , which are dominant at low energies , it is not clear whether we should compare with the lecs obtained in the one or two loop chpt analysis .",
    "actually , all of our iam lecs lie very close , or within the uncertainties , of at least one of the previous determinations given in the table . taking into account the uncertainties in these non - unitarized determinations , we consider that the agreement between the iam lecs and previous determinations is fair .",
    "let us remark that the relevant fact about this comparison is to note that we do not need to make any fine tuning of the lecs , like changing well established signs , changing order of magnitude , etc .",
    ", to describe the experimental and lattice data simultaneously .",
    "finally , we also provide in table  [ tab : lecs ] , the iamiii set of lecs , which corresponds to one of the three fits obtained using the coupled channel iam in @xcite .",
    "this set was fitted to experimental data only and the uncertainties quoted are just statistical . taking into account that we are using the single channel iam instead of the coupled channel one , and the estimate of systematic uncertainties discussed above , we see that our new fits including new experimental data and lattice results , are not too different from those already obtained in @xcite .    in fig.[fig :",
    "experiment ] we show the results of our fits compared with experimental data on @xmath6 and @xmath22 elastic scattering phase shifts .",
    "the best description is given by fit i ( continuous line ) , whereas fit ii gives a somewhat too heavy @xmath2 vector resonance ( by roughly 50 mev , i.e. , a 6% error ) .",
    "for comparison , we show as a dotted line the results of the iam if we used the chpt lecs obtained from the two - loop analysis of @xmath21 decays listed in table [ tab : lecs ] .",
    "we also show as a dot - dashed line the results that would be obtained if the non - unitarized chpt one loop results are extrapolated to higher energies using the same set of lecs .",
    "note that the iam results describe rather well both the resonant and non resonant shapes up to 1 gev or slightly above , except for the scalar isoscalar @xmath131 , that is only described up to 800 mev .",
    "this is due to the presence of the sharp rise caused by the @xmath101 resonance , that decays mostly to two kaons and can only be described with the coupled channel iam formalism , @xcite , that we do not use here for the reasons explained above .",
    "those results are , of course , well known , and these fits would just be an update of @xcite if we had not also included lattice data on the fit , that we show in fig.[fig : latticedata ] . note that we are fitting results on @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 and the @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 scattering lengths @xcite .",
    "once again we show fits i and ii as continuous and dashed lines , respectively , together with iam results using the lecs from the two - loop analysis of @xmath21 decays listed in table [ tab : lecs ] ( dotted line ) and non - unitarized chpt to one - loop with the same set of lecs ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "as explained above , we do not consider that our method should be trusted for pion masses heavier than 440 mev , being optimistic , and that is why the heavier mass region is shown as a grey area .",
    "now that we have a good description of both the energy dependence of pion - pion amplitudes together with the mass dependence of the few observables available from lattice , we can change the value of the light quark mass , keeping @xmath44 fixed , and predict the behavior of the resonances generated within the iam .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 vector resonances are well established @xmath137 states belonging to an su(3 ) octet .",
    "the first is produced in @xmath6 scattering , and its quark mass dependence was already studied within su(2 ) chpt @xcite . here we will just check that we reobtain very similar results within the su(3 ) formalism , while describing simultaneously the lattice observables shown in fig.[fig : latticedata ] .",
    "however , the @xmath3 appears in @xmath22 scattering and can only be obtained using su(3 ) chpt as we do here .",
    "thus , in fig.[fig : rhoksmhatdepend ] , we show the dependence of the light vector resonances on the non - strange quark masses , using one - loop su(3 ) chpt unitarized with the iam . for each resonance",
    ", these masses and widths are defined from the position of their associated pole in the second riemann sheet , through the usual breit - wigner identification : @xmath138 .",
    "we show the results for fits i and ii as continuous and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the results for both fits are very consistent and their difference can be taken as an estimation for systematic uncertainties in the choice of lecs . to suppress _",
    "systematic uncertainties _ we give all quantities normalized to their physical values .",
    "note that we provide two scales for the mass variation : in the upper horizontal axis , we show the variation of the quark mass in terms of @xmath139 , whereas in the lower horizontal axis we show the variation of the pion mass in terms of @xmath140 .",
    "the one - loop chpt relation between these two scales is given by eqs . and .",
    "to be precise , this relation changes for different lecs , but , as we already showed in fig.[fig : masses ] , the difference is too small to be observed with the naked eye in the axes of fig.[fig : rhoksmhatdepend ] .    in the left panels",
    "we also show , as a dotted line , the su(2 ) chpt result already obtained in @xcite , which , is fairly consistent with the new su(3 ) results .",
    "of course , the difference is somewhat larger when the pion mass is closer to the kaon mass , and the kaons start playing a more prominent role .",
    "of course , since the su(2 ) results @xcite already described fairly well the available lattice calculations for the @xmath2 mass , so it happens with the su(3 ) results here .",
    "in addition , this ensures that the @xmath141 dependence on @xmath50 agrees nicely with the estimations for the two first coefficients of its chiral expansion @xcite , which was already checked in the su(2 ) case @xcite .",
    "since the vertical scale is the same for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 plots , the similarity of their behavior is very evident .",
    "both their masses increase smoothly as the quark mass increases , but much slower than the pion mass .",
    "some differences can be observed for small @xmath48 , but this is due to the fact that the su(3 ) breaking between the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 is more evident since we keep @xmath44 fixed to its large physical value .",
    "what is interesting to observe is that the naive rule of thumb frequently used in the literature @xcite , that @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the number of valence non - strange quarks , yields the correct order of magnitude , ( and this is how it has been used in @xcite ) but would predict a 2:1 relation for the slope of the @xmath2 with respect to that of the @xmath3 , which is not observed for light quarks .",
    "continuing with our analysis , we note that , as the quark mass increases , the two - pion and pion - kaon threshold grow faster than the masses of the resonances and , as a consequence , there is a strong phase space suppression than can account exclusively for the decrease of their widths .",
    "we show in the lower panels the @xmath50 dependence of @xmath144 and @xmath145 normalized to their physical values .",
    "the decrease of the widths is largely kinematical , following remarkably well the expected reduction from phase space as the masses of the ngb increase ( thin continuous and dashed lines corresponding to fit i and fit ii respectively , although for the @xmath2 they overlap so well that the thin lines are not seen ) .",
    "this result was already found for the @xmath2 within the su(2 ) formalism and is nicely confirmed here .",
    "this suggests that there is no dynamical effect through the vector coupling to two mesons , as we will analyze next .",
    "the dynamics of resonance - meson - meson interaction is encoded in the coupling constant that we obtain from the residue of the amplitude at the pole position as follows : @xmath146 where the normalization factors are chosen to recover the usual expression for the two - meson width of narrow vector resonances : @xmath147 @xmath148 being the modulus of the meson three - momentum .",
    "actually , by identifying @xmath149 , we have explicitly checked that we obtain the same numerical value for the coupling with both equations .",
    "we find @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "then , on fig.[fig : couplingrhoks ] we show the dependence of the @xmath152 ( left ) and the @xmath153 ( right ) couplings with respect to the pion mass ( lower horizontal scale ) or the non - strange quark mass @xmath48 ( upper horizontal scale ) . in order to suppress systematic uncertainties ,",
    "we have normalized the couplings to their physical values .",
    "note that the @xmath152 is remarkably constant , deviating from its physical value by 2% at most , despite the fact that the quark mass is changed by a factor of 9 .",
    "it is also relevant because it justifies the constancy assumption made in lattice studies of the @xmath2 width @xcite .",
    "the @xmath153 is also quite independent of the non - strange quark mass , deviating by 10% at most in the chiral limit and by less than 4% when the quark mass is increased by a factor of nine . the results for fit i and ii are almost indistinguishable .",
    "the constancy of the vector - meson - meson couplings , together with the classic ksrf relation @xcite , provides a striking connection between the quark mass dependence of the rho mass and the pion decay constant .",
    "actually , the ksrf relation , obtained from pcac and vector meson dominance , reads : @xmath154 note that in our calculation we are obtaining @xmath141 from a one - loop chpt unitarized calculation , whereas @xmath58 comes simply from the next to leading order chpt calculation , but , of course , without unitarization .",
    "it is therefore quite remarkable that the ratio @xmath155 obtained from our amplitudes , shown in fig.[fig : ksfr ] , is constant within less than 5% accuracy , when the quark mass varies by a factor of 9 , or the pion mass by a factor of 3 .",
    "note that , as usual , in fig.[fig : ksfr ] we have normalized the ratio to its physical value .",
    "it seems that the simple ksrf relation holds remarkably well up to surprisingly large values of the non - strange quark mass , and therefore the @xmath141 quark mass dependence can be recast with the same factor as that for @xmath58 .",
    "a similar result is found for the @xmath3 whose ratio @xmath156 is also shown in fig.[fig : ksfr ] to deviate by less than 2% from its physical value .",
    "note that , according to the second reference in @xcite , the @xmath59 dependence does not show up in the relation .",
    "actually , had we used @xmath157 instead , the deviation would have been a factor of 3 larger .",
    "the @xmath0 , or sigma , and the @xmath1 scalar mesons are still somewhat controversial .",
    "the main problem is their huge width that makes their experimental identification complicated . despite the fact that their pole mass and width has been determined by several groups with the help of model independent dispersive techniques ( with and without chpt input ) and a fairly reasonable agreement ( see @xcite for recent determinations ) , they are still cited with extremely cautious and conservative estimates in the pdg @xcite .",
    "their nature is even more controversial , and as commented above , there are no present lattice calculations with realistic quark masses that could shed some light on the problem .",
    "it is therefore even more interesting to obtain predictions on their quark mass dependence .",
    "compared with the vector case , there is an additional complication because now we do not necessarily expect a similar behavior between the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 , since although the former should belong to an su(3 ) octet , the latter could be in the singlet , the octet , or have a significant mixture of both . as a matter of fact , there are indications that its singlet component is actually dominant @xcite .          as the data shows in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] , the sigma and kappa resonances do not present a peak nor a breit - wigner shape in the meson - meson scattering @xmath123 and @xmath158 waves , respectively .",
    "once again , these masses and widths are defined from the position of their associated pole in the second riemann sheet , as follows : @xmath138 , but one should keep in mind that these scalar states do not present the typical breit wigner shape , so there is no immediate equivalence of the mass in terms of a peak in the cross section or a time delay in the propagation .    in fig.[fig :",
    "sigmakappamhatdepend ] we show the pole mass and width dependence of light scalar resonances on the non - strange quark mass . as in fig.[fig : rhoksmhatdepend ] , we show quantities normalized to their physical values and we provide two scales for the horizontal axis : @xmath159 ( upper horizontal axis ) and @xmath160 ( lower horizontal axis ) .",
    "once again , the continuous line represents the results for fit i , the dashed line those of fit ii , and the dotted line stands for the results of unitarized su(2 ) chpt for the @xmath0 .",
    "as before we find that the fit i and ii are very consistent with each other , and , for the @xmath0 also with the existing su(2 ) calculation of @xcite .",
    "the most prominent feature of the scalars behavior is the appearance of two branches for the mass as defined above , already observed for the @xmath98 in @xcite .",
    "the reason is that for physical values of the quark mass , the poles associated with resonances appear as conjugated poles in the second riemann sheet , i.e. , there are poles at @xmath161 .",
    "of course , only the one in the lowest half plane is continuous with the physical amplitude in the real axis , and this is the one responsible for the physical resonance .",
    "however , as the quark mass increases these poles move closer to the real axis until they join in a single pole below threshold , but still in the second riemann sheet .",
    "if the quark mass is increased further , the poles split again but without leaving the real axis .",
    "the position of each one of these poles corresponds to each one of the branches that we show in the upper panel of fig.[fig : sigmakappamhatdepend ] .",
    "although this qualitative behavior is a well known possibility for potentials in scalar channels , one - loop unitarized chpt is predicting the quark mass value for which it occurs , which is a genuine prediction for qcd . for scalar - isoscalar @xmath6 scattering it was already observed in the su(2 ) case @xcite . here",
    "we are confirming this position when using su(3 ) instead of su(2 ) chpt , but we see it also happening for the @xmath1 , although the point at which it happens depends more on the set of lecs .",
    "for this reason , we think that the existence of this non - analyticity of the @xmath1 pole is robust , but not so much the precise quark mass value where it occurs .",
    "this `` apparent splitting '' can not occur for higher partial waves since they all carry a @xmath162 factor that forces the conjugated poles to join the real axis exactly at threshold , and then one of them jumps to the first riemann sheet .    apart from the evident qualitative similarities between the behavior of the @xmath0 and the kappa , it is also clear that quantitatively they behave somewhat differently . in particular , the growth of the @xmath1 mass before the `` splitting point '' is much softer than for the @xmath0 , and even softer than the @xmath2 and @xmath3 growth shown in fig.[fig : rhoksmhatdepend ] ( please note the difference in scales between both figures ) .    in the lower panels of fig.[fig :",
    "sigmakappamhatdepend ] we show the quark mass dependence of the sigma and kappa widths . on the left",
    "we show that the decrease of the sigma width we find with the su(3 ) one - loop iam is very consistent between fits i and ii , and confirm the previous results within su(2 ) @xcite . on the right",
    "we show the results for the @xmath1 width .",
    "we also show that the width decrease for both of them can not be attributed to the phase space reduction , due to the increase of pion and kaon masses , naively expected from the narrow width approximation @xmath163 which we show as a thin continuous ( dashed ) line corresponding to fit i ( ii ) .",
    "although the shape of the decrease is slightly different for the @xmath98 and @xmath99 , both scalars behave very differently than vector mesons . actually , we will see next that this implies that the scalar couplings to two mesons have a much stronger quark mass dependence than the vector ones .          as we have just seen , the narrow width approximation in eq .",
    "above is of little use for scalars .",
    "but , of course , we can still extract the coupling constant from the residue as we did for vectors , although now the equation reads @xmath164 we find @xmath165 and @xmath166 , to be compared to @xmath167 and @xmath168 , obtained in @xcite or the @xmath169 average obtained in @xcite .",
    "the agreement is fairly reasonable , taking into account that the data that have been used , the @xmath98 and @xmath99 poles , and the models in those references differ substantially for each reference .",
    "thus , in fig.[fig : couplingsigmakappa ] we show the quark mass dependence ( upper horizontal scale ) or pion mass dependence ( lower horizontal scale ) of @xmath170 and @xmath171 . as usual , all quantities are normalized to their physical values . compared with fig.[fig : couplingrhoks ] ( note the different scales ) , we see that these couplings show a much stronger quark mass dependence .",
    "moreover , they increase dramatically near the point of the `` apparent splitting '' . beyond that point",
    "there are two non - conjugate poles lying on the real axis below threshold in the second riemann sheet .",
    "for this reason , after the splitting point we plot two curves for each fit .",
    "the lowest curve corresponds to the pole closest to the threshold , that eventually jumps into the first riemann sheet .",
    "this threshold crossing from one sheet to the other corresponds to the point where the coupling tends to zero in the figures , in good agreement with the well known result in @xcite .",
    "actually this can be checked numerically , because , as shown in @xcite the coupling is inversely proportional to the energy derivative of the one - loop function ( @xmath85 in @xcite and @xmath172 in chpt @xcite ) , which is divergent at threshold . despite this consistency check , within our approach",
    "this occurs at pion masses close to the naive applicability limit , and therefore the exact @xmath50 value when this happens is not very reliable .",
    "up to here we have only been changing the values of the non - strange quark mass keeping @xmath44 fixed .",
    "however , since we are dealing with the full su(3 ) chpt formalism , we are now able to change the strange quark , keeping @xmath48 fixed .",
    "the dependence of hadronic observables on the strange quark mass is also of interest for lattice studies and for cosmological considerations @xcite . as we explained in sect.[sec : chpt ] we will only vary the strange quark mass in the limited range @xmath49 to ensure that the kaon does not become too heavy to spoil the chpt convergence nor too light to require a coupled channel formalism to deal with the @xmath3 or @xmath1 resonances , thus introducing additional model dependences in our approach .            as in previous sections",
    "we define the mass and width of the vector resonances from the position of their associated poles .",
    "thus , in the upper panels of fig.[fig : rhoksmsdepend ] we show the quark mass dependence ( or kaon mass dependence in the lower horizontal scale ) of the @xmath96 and @xmath3 masses . in the lower panels we show the dependence of their widths . as usual , all quantities are normalized to their physical values to suppress systematic uncertainties .    as it could be expected , both the mass and width of the @xmath2 , being non - strange , are almost independent of the strange quark mass within the range of study .",
    "note that the @xmath96 mass actually decreases very slightly , by roughly 1% .",
    "since the pion mass almost remains constant  see eq . and the @xmath173 values in table  [ tab : lecs ] ",
    ", this implies that phase space decreases slightly for smaller strange quark mass and the @xmath2 width decreases accordingly .",
    "actually , we can check in fig.[fig : rhoksmsdepend ] that the width reduction follows remarkably well the phase space reduction expected from eq .",
    "( thin continuous and dashed lines ) .",
    "looking now at the right panels of fig.[fig : rhoksmsdepend ] , we notice that , as expected , the @xmath174 shows a much stronger dependence than the @xmath2 on the strange quark or the kaon masses . on the one hand , when the kaon mass is made lighter , the @xmath3 mass decreases , as it happened when changing the light quark mass , although much faster , i.e. , up to 5% when the kaon mass decreases by 20% . nevertheless , and contrary to what happened when reducing @xmath175 , the @xmath3 width increases significantly , up to 40% .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath3 decays to @xmath22 , but the kaon mass decrease is faster than that of the @xmath3 . on the other hand , when the kaon mass is made heavier , the @xmath3 mass grows , but much slower than the kaon mass , so that phase space shrinks and the resonance width decreases once more .",
    "we are also showing as thin lines the expected variation of the widths if their only quark mass dependence came from the change in the particles masses and the naive phase space suppression in eq .",
    "( thin continuous for fit i and thin dashed for fit ii ) .",
    "we see that they are in very good agreement with our results from the iam , which suggests that their coupling to two mesons is almost independent of the quark masses , which we will see next .      thus , in fig .",
    "[ fig : couplingrhoksms ] we show the dependence both on @xmath44 and kaon masses of the vector to meson - meson couplings . as usual",
    "everything is normalized to their physical values .",
    "it can be noted that within the range of variation under study , which is 30% for the strange quark mass in either direction , both the @xmath152 and @xmath153 couplings change by 1% at most .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksfrms ] we show the results for the ksrf relation variation in terms of the strange quark mass .",
    "since the @xmath96 coupling has virtually no dependence on @xmath44 , the relation remains trivially constant . for the @xmath3",
    "the relation is well satisfied ( to within less than 5% from the physical value ) in the whole @xmath44 range of our study .",
    "we simply repeat the procedure we used to study the light quark variation in sec .",
    "[ sec : lightscalarmesons ] , but this time changing the strange quark mass instead , and keeping @xmath48 fixed .",
    "thus , in fig .  [",
    "fig : sigmakappamsdepend ] , we show the variation of the sigma and @xmath1 masses and widths with respect to the kaon mass variation ( lower horizontal scale ) or the strange quark mass ( upper horizontal scale ) . once again all masses are normalized to their physical values .",
    "as it could be expected , we see in the left panels that the change on the sigma is smaller than 1% on both mass and width ( beware we have changed the scale with respect to the previous fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmakappamhatdepend ] to make the changes more visible ) .",
    "a much bigger effect is seen for the @xmath1 in the right panels , whose mass changes by as much as 12% from its physical value within the range of study , whereas the width changes by as much as 20%",
    ". however , its mass dependence , despite being somewhat stronger than for its vector counterpart @xmath3 , is still softer than for the kaon itself .",
    "this is the reason why , as the @xmath1 becomes lighter its width increases , and viceversa .    in the lower panels we have also plotted the expected naive phase space reduction .",
    "this time , however , as the sigma properties barely depend on the strange quark mass , we only see a significant deviation from that naive behavior in the case of the @xmath1 .          for all means and purposes , with respect to strange quark mass variations ,",
    "the sigma coupling to two mesons turns out to be a constant within our approximation , as can be seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : couplingsigmakappams ] .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath176 coupling shows some dependence on the strange quark mass .",
    "actually , it grows by 6% when the kaon mass is increased by 18% from its physical value .",
    "in this work we have studied the quark mass dependence of the light vector and scalar resonances generated as poles of meson - meson scattering elastic amplitudes within unitarized one - loop chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "this dependence is of interest to relate lattice results to hadronic observables , but also for anthropic and cosmological considerations .",
    "the use of an su(3 ) formalism extends previous studies within su(2 ) , allowing us to study the behavior of strange resonances like the @xmath1 and @xmath3 , but also to study variations not only of the light @xmath4 and @xmath5 quark masses , but also of the strange quark mass .    after a brief introduction on how chpt provides a model independent expansion of pion , kaon and eta masses and decay constants , as well as their two body interaction amplitudes , we have reviewed how this series can be used inside a dispersion theory formalism to construct the so called inverse amplitude method ( iam )",
    "amplitudes that satisfy elastic unitarity while respecting the chpt expansion .",
    "it has been known for long that the elastic iam reproduces well the meson - meson elastic scattering data up to 800 - 1000 mev , including the resonance region .",
    "note that we have refrained for the moment to use the very successful coupled channel iam precisely because at present it lacks a dispersive derivation , and we want to avoid as much model dependence as possible . of course the experimental data may fix rather well the energy dependence but not so well the mass dependence .",
    "for that reason we have presented here a new iam analysis including simultaneously the existing lattice results on meson masses , decay constants and scattering lengths .",
    "we obtain a fairly good description of experiment and lattice data using chiral parameters rather similar to existing one and two - loop determinations .",
    "no fine tuning of parameters is required .",
    "once this is done , we have varied the quark masses within certain ranges that ensure the applicability of the elastic iam for the resonances under study : @xmath47 and @xmath49 ( @xmath48 is the average mass of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks ) . in practice ,",
    "in chpt we have changed the squared pion and kaon masses , which , at leading order , are proportional to quark masses . although we have shown in fig.[fig : masses ] that this simple approximation works within roughly 10% accuracy , we have carefully included the full one - loop corrections , and shown the quark and meson mass variation independently in all plots .    in the second riemann sheet of these amplitudes ,",
    "the iam generates the  conjugated pairs of  poles associated to the vector @xmath2 , @xmath3 and scalar @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances .",
    "light vector resonances are well established and there is little relevance on whether we refer to their `` pole '' or breit - wigner mass and widths .",
    "in contrast , the scalar @xmath0 , or `` sigma '' and the @xmath1 are rather controversial due to their large apparent width and the lack of a breit - wigner shape in the meson - meson scattering phase shifts . to avoid complications , we have always presented our results in terms of `` pole '' definitions of masses , widths and couplings .    for the @xmath0 and @xmath2 resonances , which appear in @xmath6 scattering ,",
    "we have nicely confirmed the similar unitarized one - loop su(2 ) chpt analysis performed in @xcite .",
    "when increasing @xmath48 both the sigma and @xmath96 masses grow faster than the pion mass , whereas their widths decrease . however , the @xmath2 mass behaves smoothly in the whole quark mass range , whereas , roughly at @xmath177mev , the @xmath0 pole and its conjugated pair meet in the second riemann sheet below threshold , producing a non analyticity  or `` apparent splitting '' in two branches  of the sigma mass in terms of @xmath50 .",
    "in addition , we confirm that the @xmath2 width decrease , as @xmath48 grows , follows remarkably well the simple expectations of phase space reduction already found within the su(2 ) formalism . once again , such a simple behavior is not observed for the sigma .",
    "of course , the su(3 ) formalism allows us now to study also the @xmath3 and @xmath1 resonances in @xmath22 scattering .",
    "we find that both the mass and width of the @xmath3 behave qualitatively and quantitatively in a very similar way to those of the @xmath2 , which could be expected given the fact that they belong to the same octet .",
    "in addition , we have explicitly calculated here their couplings to two mesons , from the residue of the partial wave at their associated pole , finding that they are both remarkably independent of the non - strange quark mass , as suggested from the width behavior .",
    "the @xmath3 coupling is quite well approximated by a constant , although not so well as in the @xmath96 case .",
    "this could be of relevance when computing its width on the lattice as it has already been done for the @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "it therefore seems that light quark masses play no significant role in the _ dynamics _ of the dominant decay modes of vector mesons , namely @xmath178 and @xmath179 , since their couplings seem to be independent of light quark masses and all their width variation can be attributed to the phase space modification due to changes in the masses of all particles .    furthermore , this provides a hint , checked here by explicit calculation , that the ksrf relation , that approximates these couplings by @xmath180 , holds to less than 5% when changing @xmath48 from 0 to 9 times its physical value .",
    "it is remarkable that this relation is so well satisfied , first , because ours is a one - loop calculation , which , in principle includes higher order pion mass corrections to ksrf , and the pion mass becomes rather large , but , second , because our resonance masses come from unitarized amplitudes whereas @xmath58 stems from the non - unitarized chpt truncated series .",
    "concerning the @xmath1 , its behavior is qualitatively similar to that of the `` sigma '' , including the `` apparent mass splitting '' in two branches , which is a feature that can only occur for scalars .",
    "however , the @xmath1 non - strange quark mass dependence is softer than for the sigma .",
    "still the pion mass where the @xmath1 `` apparent mass splitting '' occurs is similar to that of the sigma , although with bigger uncertainties @xmath181mev . of course",
    ", contrary to the vector case , one could now expect some differences between the two scalars since they do not necessarily belong to the same octet and actually , the sigma is believed to be predominantly the singlet state @xcite , and it could even allow for a glueball component . as we did with the vectors , in this work we have also calculated explicitly the behavior of the scalar couplings to two mesons under quark mass variations .",
    "we find a qualitatively similar behavior for both @xmath170 and @xmath182 : contrary to vectors , they can not be considered constant within the variation range , particularly when @xmath50 comes close to the `` apparent mass splitting '' value , where it suffers a dramatic enhancement .",
    "finally , since we use the su(3 ) formalism , we have been able to study the dependence of light resonance properties on the strange quark mass .",
    "due to the fact that the physical mass of the kaons is already quite high but also because we want the @xmath183 threshold to be significantly above the @xmath3 mass , we have limited our study to the range @xmath49 . as it could be naively expected , and in contrast to strange resonances , the masses and widths of both the non - strange @xmath96 and @xmath98 are remarkably independent of the strange quark mass .",
    "this time , the @xmath1 mass has a much stronger dependence than that of the @xmath174  actually , it grows a factor of three faster .",
    "once again , the @xmath174 width follows remarkably well the behavior dictated by phase space only , and we have checked that its @xmath22 coupling is almost independent of @xmath44 .",
    "the ksrf relation is also a fairly good approximation in the whole energy range , although not as good as in the case of the non - strange quark .",
    "concerning the @xmath1 , once again its coupling is strongly dependent on the quark mass , so that its width does not follow the naive phase space behavior .    in summary , we have presented an exhaustive study on the strange and non - strange quark mass dependence of light scalar and vector resonances appearing in elastic goldstone bosons scattering . for the future , this work could be extended to other light scalar mesons like the @xmath101 and @xmath100 using a coupled channel formalism , that is somewhat less rigorous as it has no dispersive derivation , and also is much more complicated due to the presence of the @xmath184 threshold .    to conclude , and apart from the interest for studies of constraints on hadronic properties from cosmological or anthropic considerations , we think that the quark mass dependence studied here will be within the reach of lattice studies in the not too distant future  it is already so for the @xmath96 meson  and we expect our results to be useful in the chiral extrapolation of lattice results to physical values .",
