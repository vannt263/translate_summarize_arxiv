    "nanomaterials incorporating semiconductor quantum dots ( sqds ) , metal nanoparticles ( mnps ) , metal surfaces , and dye molecules have been studied intensively @xcite .",
    "such hybrid structures take advantage of physical properties of different material systems and demonstrate useful sensor and light - harvesting properties . in a complex made of emitter ( sqd or dye ) and mnps , excitons and plasmons interact via the coulomb forces .",
    "emission of sqd ( dye ) in the presence of mnps can be suppressed or enhanced depending on the size and organization of nano - assembly @xcite .",
    "this occurs due to the following physical factors : ( 1 ) modified density of states of photons , ( 2 ) amplified absorption in the presence of plasmon resonance in the mnps , and ( 3 ) shortening of exciton lifetime due to an increased radiation rate and energy transfer to the mnps .",
    "theoretically , an emitting dipole in the vicinity of metal objects has been studied in many publications @xcite .",
    "the exciton - plasmon interaction between an emitting dipole and metal objects leads to energy transfer , a shift of energy of quantum emitter , and vacuum rabi oscillations @xcite .",
    "the energy transfer mechanism is similar to f@xmath0rster transfer between two dye molecules @xcite . in most theoretical publications ,",
    "the energy transfer in nanoscale systems was treated as uni - directional flow of energy from a donor to accepter using the rate equations .",
    "this rate - equation approach describes non - coherent interactions at elevated temperatures .",
    "very recently , several theoretical studies were performed for the quantum regime of exciton - plasmon interaction between a sqd / dye and mnp @xcite .",
    "these studies revealed a novel feature of strongly - interacting hybrid nanocrystals - interference effects .",
    "the absorption spectra of coupled sqd and mnp acquire characteristic asymmetry due to the interference of external and induced electric fields . at low temperatures and small exciton broadening ,",
    "the absorption line shapes are described by the fano formula @xcite . however , previous theoretical results @xcite were based on the dipole approximation .",
    "the dipole approximation is valid when an exciton - mnp distance is large , compared to the sizes of components , and the exciton - plasmon interaction is relatively weak .",
    "but , the most interesting regime of strong exciton - plasmon interaction appears when a exciton - mnp distance is small and the dipole approximation is not valid anymore",
    ". therefore , to describe the regime of strong exciton - plasmon coupling , one should treat the coulomb interaction exactly , including electric multipole effects . in this paper",
    "we obtain an exact solution for the problem of interacting dipole and mnp .    here",
    "we present a theory of strong exciton - plasmon interaction and show that the multipole effects are of crucial importance for the understanding of the exciton - plasmon interaction in the most interesting regime of small exciton - mnp separations .",
    "a strong interaction between excitons and plasmons at small exciton - mnp distances reveals itself in absorption spectra as asymmetric lineshapes and anti - resonances ( deep minima ) .",
    "moreover , we consider two types of nanoscale hybrid complexes ( sqd - mnp and dye - mnp ) and show that , for small exciton - mnp distances , the interference effects can appear in room - temperature experiments . for the multipole regime of coulomb interaction ,",
    "the visibility of exciton resonance grows dramatically due to both the interference effect and the plasmon - induced electromagnetic enhancement . for large inter - particle distances , the absorptions by sqd and mnp",
    "add up constructively .",
    "for the hybrid structures of small dimensions , the spectra exhibit very strong effects of constructive and destructive interference . we think that these interference effects can be observed experimentally using presently available material systems .    in this paper ,",
    "we discuss three material systems : colloidal nanocrystals , self - assembled dots , and dye molecules .",
    "most of the current experiments on metal - semiconductor and metal - dye assemblies employ colloidal nanoparticles @xcite and nano - wires @xcite . to observe the effects described in this paper ,",
    "single colloidal nanocrystal complexes can be deposited on a surface or buried in a polymer film .",
    "assemble measurements of colloidal complexes in a solution can also be suitable .",
    "presently , there are attempts to fabricated metal nanoparticles inside epitaxial structures @xcite .",
    "potentially , colloidal and epitaxial nanocrystals can be combined in one structure @xcite .",
    "for example , an epitaxial dot can be buried close to the surface @xcite and a mnp can be attached to the surface .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a description of the electric field inside the system .",
    "the optical properties of a nanocrystal molecule are presented in section iii .",
    "section iv discusses the absorption line shape .",
    "the numerical results for sqd - mnp molecules and dye molecule - mnp nanocrystals are given in section v. finally , a brief conclusion is presented .",
    "now we consider the hybrid nanocrystal molecule composed of a spherical mnp of radius @xmath1 and a spherical sqd of radius @xmath2 in the environment with dielectric constant @xmath3 ( see fig.[molecule](a ) ) . the center - to - center distance for the nanocrystals",
    "is denoted as @xmath4 . in the following",
    ", we will assume that a sqd has small dimensions @xmath5 , whereas the size of mnp can be arbitrary , i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "in the case of a dye molecule - mnp complex , the size @xmath4 becomes irrelevant and we have only the obvious condition : the molecule - mnp distance @xmath4 should be larger than the mnp radius , i.e. @xmath7 .",
    "when the hybrid molecule ( sqd - mnp or dye - mnp ) is radiated with a laser , the oscillating electric field excites both the interband transition in a sqd and the plasmon in a mnp .",
    "the interband transition ( exciton ) in a sqd ( dye ) has an oscillating dipole moment and , therefore , creates an oscillating electric field that acts on a mnp and excites the plasmons .",
    "the plasmons excited in a mnp in turn influence the exciton . in this way , the exciton and plasmon form a new collective excitation - a hybrid exciton .",
    "the origin of this hybrid exciton is in the coulomb interaction between a sqd and mnp fig.[molecule](b ) .",
    "since a nanoscale structure has small dimensions , we assume that the electric field of the laser is spacial uniform and use the quasistatic approximation .",
    "also , we describe the mnp with the local dynamic dielectric function @xmath8 .        by carefully solving the laplace s equations @xmath9",
    ", we can get the electric potential @xmath10 and so the electric field @xmath11 . as for the dipole in sqd , we take it as a perfect dipole , labeled as @xmath12 , because the radius of sqd @xmath2 is much smaller in contrast with @xmath1 usually .",
    "we now consider the laser electric field in the form @xmath13 .",
    "we first discuss the part with positive frequency , @xmath14 .",
    "the electric field inside sqd could be split in three parts : @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the electric field induced by @xmath17 inside a sqd in the absence of a mnp : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the effective dielectric constant of the sqd and @xmath20 is the background dielectric constant of semiconductor .",
    "the second part @xmath21 comes from surface charges of mnp induced only by the external optical electric field @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24/[\\varepsilon_m(\\omega)+2\\varepsilon_e]$ ] and @xmath25 for electric field polarization @xmath17 is parallel to the @xmath26 axis .",
    "the choice of a sign of imaginary part of dialectic constant should be the following : @xmath27>0 $ ] if @xmath28 .",
    "the last part @xmath29 is the sqd - felt effective electric field produced by the multipole polarization in mnp induced by the effective dipole of sqd @xmath30 .",
    "this part is the most important one , underlying the interaction of the mnp and sqd .",
    "we finally find this part of electric field is @xmath31 where @xmath32 and the coefficients @xmath33 or @xmath34 for the polarization @xmath12 is parallel to the @xmath35 or @xmath36 axis respectively . here",
    "@xmath37 is the legendre function and @xmath34 is the differential of legendre function at the argument of 1 .    when @xmath38 , the electric field @xmath39 becomes @xmath40 which is the very result under the dipole approximation : the sqd dipole - induced electric field everywhere inside the mnp is uniform and equals to the value at the center of mnp .",
    "this dipole approximation is used in ref.@xcite , which is reasonable when the distance @xmath4 is relatively large because the factor @xmath41 makes other terms negligible . however , when the distance is comparable to the radius of mnp , i.e. @xmath6 , which is always the case in such molecules , the items @xmath42 become important and may even have a bigger contribution than the leading terms .",
    "actually the items with different @xmath43 are related to different order multipole polarization in mnp : @xmath38 is dipole , @xmath44 quadrupole , @xmath45 octopole and so on .",
    "the function of @xmath46 , eqn.([multipole ] ) , also reflects the characteristics of the multipole polarization as tells by the mie theory @xcite .",
    "but it should notice that the multipole effect in mie theory is caused by the comparable radius of mnp with wavelength of the light . here",
    "the radius is small enough to neglect the effect and hence the multipole effect totally comes from the induced polarization by the sqd when the the interparticle distance is relatively small .",
    "the electric field inside mnp @xmath47 can also be solved , and the corresponding positive frequency part is @xmath48 , where @xmath49/3 $ ] and @xmath50 is @xmath51\\label{mnp1}\\\\ & & \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{\\texttt{mnp}}|_{\\boldsymbol{e}\\parallel\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x } } } = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{\\beta_nr^{n-1}|\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{p}}| } { \\varepsilon_{\\texttt{eff1}}r_d^{n+2}}\\bigg\\{\\big[-np_{n-1}(z / r)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad-\\frac{z}{r}p'_{n-1}(z / r)+\\frac{x^2}{r^2 } p''_{n-1}(z / r)\\big]\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad+\\dfrac{xy}{r^2}p''_{n-1}(z / r)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}-(n+1)\\dfrac{x}{r}p'_{n-1}(z / r ) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}\\bigg\\}\\label{mnp2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 when @xmath38 , the electric field inside the mnp , @xmath53 is just the electric field produced by the dipole inside the sqd at the point of mnp s spherical center , the dipole approximation .",
    "in the sqd , we use a two - level exciton model to describe the optical process .",
    "the exciting laser field is now taken in the form : @xmath54 . under these conditions ,",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the annihilation and creation operator of level @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , corresponding to the vacuum ground state and the exciton state respectively ( see fig.[molecule](b ) ) .",

    "@xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the interband optical transition matrix element . the excitation @xmath63 can be written as : @xmath64 ; the terms in this equation are defined by eqns.([elec1 ] , [ elec2 ] and [ elec3 ] ) .",

    "the dipole of the sqd relates to the interband polarization by @xmath69 , @xmath70 . in the rotating wave and steady state approximation , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is time - independent .",

    "while @xmath79 is determined by the electric field of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath77 comes totally from the contribution of the electric field @xmath39 , responsible for the interaction between mnp and sqd .",
    "therefore the plasmon - exciton interaction leads to the formation of a hybrid exciton with shifted exciton frequency and decreased lifetime determined by @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively .    for a weak external field , @xmath82 ( since @xmath83 ) and eqn.([solution ] ) and eqn.([solution2 ] ) yield the solution of the problem . for a strong driving field ,",
    "the problem is reduced to the nonlinear equation ( eqn.([solution ] ) ) investigated in  @xcite .",
    "since the quantity @xmath75 includes multipole polarization in mnp , the energy shift is determined by the multipole effect rather than a simple dipole effect . in fig.[aug](top ) , we plot the @xmath84 with the change of frequency @xmath85 .",

    "the relative contribution of scattering to the extinction for metal particles of radius less than about 30 nm can be negligible . in the mnp - sqd molecules fabricated in recent experiments ,",

    "as shown in fig.[shift ] , in dipole approximation , the peak of absorption rate has blue shift . with multipole effect , the peak s shift of energy absorption rate changes to the red direction and the broadening increases a lot .",
    "other parameters are the same as those for figure [ aug].,width=321 ]    the total energy absorption versus interparticle distances for a fixed frequency is presented in fig.[changrd ] , which shows that with decreasing the interparticle distance , the energy absorption first increases , then decreases .",

    "the dipole approximation fails to provide the correct picture .",
    "the energy absorption of mnp and sqd versus interparticle distance show the similar results ( not shown here ) .",
    "the existence of optimal distance for sqd energy absorption can be understood in the following way .",
    "the energy absorption of sqd depends on the competition of two factors : the local field enhancement and transfer the energy to mnp . with decreasing interparticle distance ,",

    "[ colloidal]c .",
    "overall , the interference features ( asymmetry and anti - resonance ) become very strong at small distances where the multipole effect govern the inter - particle coulomb interaction .",
    "it is interesting to note that for large @xmath4 ( in fig.[colloidal ] ) the exciton peak and mnp plasmon spectrum are added constructively whereas for small @xmath4 we obtain destructive interference or anti - resonance for the laser light along @xmath135 or @xmath136 . for the laser light along @xmath137 , we see both strong constructive and destructive effects ; however , the destructive deep is stronger .",
    "the physical origin of the destructive interference is in a reduction of absorption by the mnp ( i.e. the term @xmath93 in the total absorption ) due to the destructive interplay of external and induced electric fields . regarding the absorption by the sqd ( i.e. the term @xmath138 ) , the integrated absorption by the sqd increases with decreasing @xmath4 for @xmath139 and decreases with shortening @xmath4 for @xmath140 .",

    "it is interesting that the visibility of the exciton in sqd - mnp molecules becomes greatly increased for small @xmath4 ( figs .",
    "[ colloidal ] and [ epitaxial ] ) .",

    "the increased visibility of the exciton resonance in a sqd - mnp molecule was also found for the dipole regime of interaction in ref .",

    "importantly , even for the large room - temperature broadening ( 23mev ) , we see the ani - resonance . if a few or many dye molecules are attached , the depth of the anti - resonance will increase . neglecting the interaction between dye molecules and the dipole orientation ,",
    "we can write @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the anti - resonance coefficient for the @xmath87-molecule complex , @xmath113 is the coefficient for a single dye molecule , and @xmath87 is the number of attached dye molecules .",
    "correspondingly , the depth of the anti - resonance of the n - molecule complex becomes @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is depth of the anti - resonance for a single dye molecule . from fig .",
    "[ dye ] we see that the effect of the single exciton anti - resonance on the total absorption spectrum @xmath158 or 3.5% .",
    "if we now assume a structure with @xmath88 , we obtain @xmath159 35% .",
    "this tells us that the change in the total absorption spectrum due to the exciton - plasmon anti - resonance can be seen experimentally .",
    "we investigate the optical properties of hybrid molecules composed of sqd , dye , and mnps .",
    "the main focus of the paper is the regime of strong exciton - plasmon interaction and multipole effects .",
    "first we derive an exact analytical solution for electric fields and absorption spectra .",
    "then , we show that the multipole effects play the crucial role for the strong interaction regime .",
    "when the interparticle distance is relatively small , the multipole effect gives significantly larger peak shifts and broadenings for the energy absorption rate and the dipole approximation fails .",
    "the results obtained in this paper can be used to analyze optical experiments on hybrid systems with a strong exciton - plasmon interaction .",
