    "recently , there was growing evidence that the ym - vacuum favours a condensate of mass dimension 2 @xcite .",
    "a reasonable candidate is @xmath1 where @xmath2 labels an arbitrary gauge transformation .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is a gauge invariant operator and so has some physical meaning .",
    "it reduces to the local composite operator ( lco ) @xmath3 in the landau gauge .",
    "the landau gauge is in a way the most natural one to perform calculations . with another gauge fixing , ( [ 1 ] )",
    "is no longer local .",
    "more precisely , thinking of abelian projection and imposing the maximally abelian gauge ( mag ) , we should consider the gauge invariant operator @xmath4 where the index @xmath5 runs only over the off - diagonal gluons . in mag , this simplifies to the lco @xmath6 .",
    "+   + we mentioned mag , because interesting attempts have been undertaken by kondo e.a . @xcite and recently freire @xcite to construct low energy effective theories starting from the full ym lagrangian .",
    "their efforts rest mainly on the principle of abelian dominance @xcite , which can be understood by means of massive off - diagonal gluons and the appelquist - carazzone decoupling theorem @xcite .",
    "mag requires a 4-ghost interaction to preserve renormalizibility @xcite , and this non - trivial ghost interaction was used in @xcite to produce an effective charged gluon mass .",
    "our analysis learned that , in contrast to their results , the ghost condensate alone resulted in a tachyonic mass . we guess that a combination of the off - diagonal ghost and gluon condensate might provide us with a real mass . +   + for the sake of simplicity , we present the different approaches using the gn - model .",
    "available results on ym in the landau gauge will be quoted too .",
    "we start from the manifestly u(@xmath0)-invariant gn lagrangian in @xmath7 dimensional euclidean spacetime with a source @xmath8 coupled to the lco @xmath9 @xmath10 this is an asymptotically free theory with a chiral @xmath11 symmetry if @xmath12 , preventing a perturbative non - zero value for @xmath13 and the fermion mass . when @xmath14 , new logarithmic infinities @xmath15 ( multiplicative mass renormalization ) and @xmath16 ( vacuum energy divergences ) appear . in order to remove the latter ,",
    "a new coupling @xmath17 must be incorporated into ( [ 3 ] ) , and we get @xmath18 where @xmath19 contains all counterterm information . @xmath20 defining the bare quantities as @xmath21 the finite , generating energy functional @xmath22 satisfies a homogeneous renormalization group equation ( rge ) @xmath23 with @xmath24 the above reasoning to treat a lco seems to have 2 problems : first , @xmath17 is at this stage still arbitrary , so we have a problem of uniqueness . putting @xmath25 is a bad choice , it leads to a non - homogeneous rge for @xmath26 and a non - linear rge for the effective action @xmath27 .",
    "secondly , the @xmath28 term spoils a simple energy interpretation . these are reflections of the criticism uttered by banks and raby on the use of lco @xcite .",
    "both problems can be solved by choosing @xmath17 such a function of @xmath29 , so that if @xmath29 runs according to @xmath30 , @xmath17 will run properly according to @xmath31 @xcite . indeed , because of ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) , we have @xmath32 where @xmath33a solution of ( [ 8 ] ) is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a particular solution of @xmath36the integration constant has been put to zero , in order to avoid an independent coupling constant and to have multiplicatively renormalizable vacuum divergences @xmath37",
    ". we will solve ( [ 11 ] ) by a laurent expansion @xmath38 notice that @xmath39-loop results require @xmath40-loop knowledge of @xmath30,@xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the generating functional @xmath26 now fulfills @xmath43we conclude that the lco @xmath44 has a finite and multiplicatively renormalizable vev @xmath45 .",
    "the effective action @xmath46 , obeys the following rge @xmath47 introducing unity via the hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xmath48\\exp-\\frac{1}{2z_{\\zeta}\\zeta}\\int      d^{2-\\varepsilon}x\\left[\\frac{\\sigma}{g}+\\mu^{\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}}z_{2}\\overline{\\psi}\\psi-\\mu^{\\frac{-\\varepsilon}{2}}z_{\\zeta}\\zeta      j \\right]^2\\ ] ] we finally arrive at @xmath49\\exp-\\int      d^{2-\\varepsilon}x\\left[{\\cal l}(\\sigma,\\overline{\\psi},\\psi)-\\mu^{\\frac{-\\varepsilon}{2}}\\frac{\\sigma}{g}j\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath50+\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2g^{2}z_{\\zeta}\\zeta}+\\mu^{\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}}g\\sigma\\overline{\\psi}\\psi\\frac{z_{2}}{g^{2}z_{\\zeta}\\zeta}\\ ] ] @xmath8 is now a real source , in the sense that it appears linearly for @xmath51 so that we have a straightforward energy interpretation and @xmath52 .",
    "eq.([19 ] ) is a new effective , renormalized lagrangian for gn , equivalent to the original ( [ 3 ] ) but encapsulating non - perturbative information .",
    "perturbing around @xmath53 , we recover the original perturbation series with its infrared renormalon problems .",
    "if we calculate the effective potential for @xmath54 , we could perturb around a non - perturbative vacuum free of renormalons . +   + we wo nt rederive @xmath55 ,",
    "the results can be found in the original papers @xcite . out of ( [ 19 ] )",
    ", we immediately see that @xmath56 gives birth to a fermion mass . after improving the renormalization prescriptions , very accurate results for the effective fermion mass",
    "were obtained ( see table i ) . for comparison",
    ", we also displayed the @xmath57 and @xmath58 results .",
    "[ tabel1 ]    .deviation in terms of percentage for the mass gap with lco method [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the source inversion method was also tested on the chiral gross - neveu model , again with good results @xcite .",
    "we have dealt with 2 different approaches concerning dynamical mass generation .",
    "each method seems to give ( very good ) results in case of gn .",
    "the almost exact gn results does nt mean we can generalize immediately to the ym case ( in the landau gauge ) .",
    "other sources of non - perturbative effects besides infrared renormalons , such as instantons , will contribute to the dynamical mass .",
    "+   + in the future , also mag ym deserves our attention , first trying to clear the widely accepted abelian dominance in a somewhat analytical way .",
    "secondly , there might exist a connection between those condensate formations and the curci - ferrari lagrangian @xcite .",
    "+   + as a general conclusion , we state it is possible to get non - perturbative information on e.g. a dynamical gluon mass in a sector of the ym - vacuum accessible to perturbation theory .",
