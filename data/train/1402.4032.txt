    "nonlinear methods such as filter diagonalization @xcite and harmonic inversion @xcite have been established which allow for the high - resolution analysis of signals , i.e. , the frequencies and amplitudes of a time signal with finite length can be determined with high accuracy without the restriction by the uncertainty principle of the fourier transform .",
    "those methods can be applied to obtain the eigenspectra of large matrices @xcite , semiclassical periodic orbit quantisation @xcite , and the analysis of quantum spectra @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to analyse spectra given as the superposition of resonances with lorentzian line shape ( e.g.  the level density or scattering cross section of open quantum systems or microcavities ) , and to determine the exact positions and corresponding amplitudes of the resonance poles in the complex energy plane @xcite .",
    "so far , the harmonic inversion method has typically been applied to spectra with non - degenerate complex resonances , and the formulae and derivations presented , e.g.  in @xcite are restricted to that case .",
    "however , two or more resonances can degenerate at an exceptional point ( ep ) @xcite in the complex energy plane .",
    "the occurrence of eps in open quantum systems has attracted much attention since at these points not only the resonance energies but also the eigenstates coalesce @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the eps are branching singularities of non - hermitian operators @xcite and show interesting properties such as the permutation of states when the ep is encircled along a closed path in the parameter space of the system .",
    "theoretical investigations have revealed the existence of eps , e.g.in spectra of the hydrogen atom in crossed magnetic and electric fields @xcite and in bose - einstein condensates with long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "experimentally , eps have been observed in spectra of microwave resonators @xcite and in electronic circuits @xcite .",
    "recently , an experiment has been proposed to observe a third order ep in the dynamics of a single particle in a time - dependent harmonic trap @xcite .    in most of the systems mentioned above signatures of an ep",
    "have been verified using properties of the nearly degenerate states in the close vicinity of the exact degeneracy , viz .",
    "the permutation behaviour of states when the ep is encircled in the parameter space",
    ". however , in some systems , e.g.  that discussed by uzdin @xcite , appropriate parameters for the encircling of an ep do not exist or at least are not experimentally accessible .",
    "therefore , alternative methods for the verification of eps are needed .",
    "dietz @xcite have verified the existence of the ep in a microwave billiard with time - reversal invariance violation both via its encircling and , as an alternative , via directly observing the coalescence of two eigenvectors at the ep . in this paper , we study the features of eps close to or even exactly at the degeneracy . in resonance spectra a resonance related to an ep",
    "is characterised by a non - lorentzian line shape . in the time domain",
    "the survival probability of that resonance shows a non - exponential decay @xcite .",
    "we extend the harmonic inversion method to handle the degeneracies occurring at eps .",
    "the extended method provides the amplitudes of the first and higher order poles in the complex energy or frequency plane and thus the exact profile of both lorentzian and non - lorentzian resonance line shapes . in the time domain",
    "the harmonic inversion method yields the decay signal of a resonance given by an exponential function multiplied by a polynomial in time .",
    "the observation of a resonance with non - lorentzian line shape or non - exponentially decaying time signal can be taken as clear evidence for the existence of an exceptional point in the system .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : hi ] the harmonic inversion method is introduced and extended to the case of degenerate resonances .",
    "the method is applied to the analysis of exceptional points by way of two examples in section  [ sec : ep_analysis ] .",
    "firstly , in section  [ sec : hatom ] the non - lorentzian shape of a resonance related to an ep is revealed in the photoabsorption spectrum of the hydrogen atom in crossed magnetic and electric fields , and , secondly , in section  [ sec : harm_trap ] a third order ep is observed in the dynamics of a single particle in a time - dependent harmonic trap .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "for the convenience of the reader we first briefly recapitulate the harmonic inversion method for spectra with non - degenerate resonances and then extend the method by including degeneracies .",
    "a spectrum of non - degenerate resonances is given by the imaginary part of the function @xmath2 where the complex parameters @xmath3 with @xmath4 determine the positions and widths of the resonances and the complex @xmath5 describe the amplitudes and details of the lorentzian line shapes .",
    "the aim of the harmonic inversion method is to extract the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath5 from the spectrum given on an equidistant grid of points along the real @xmath6-axis .",
    "the first step is to apply the fourier transform to @xmath7 to obtain the signal @xmath8 the parameters @xmath9 in are introduced to analyse the spectrum in the window @xmath10 $ ] , i.e.  the real parts of the @xmath3 on the r.h.s .  of are in the range @xmath11 .",
    "note that @xmath12 is the number of poles in that window and can be small compared to the number of poles in the full spectrum @xmath7 .",
    "the set of resonances in a larger region is then obtained by analysing several consecutive windows @xcite .",
    "the harmonic inversion of band - limited signals @xmath13 with @xmath12 not larger than about 50 to 200 is numerically more efficient and stable compared to the analysis of a signal with a huge number of frequencies . when the spectrum is given on equidistant grid points @xmath14 for @xmath15 the fourier integral in is approximated by a discrete sum . using the time step @xmath16",
    "the signal points @xmath17 are easily obtained for @xmath18 with a fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm .",
    "considering the factor @xmath19 in as a shift of resonances , @xmath20 , the comparison with the signal @xmath21 in yields @xmath22\\}^n    = \\sum_{k=1}^k { \\hat d}_k z_k^n \\label{eq : cn}\\ ] ] for @xmath18 and with the abbreviations @xmath23 and @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the second step is to determine the @xmath25 parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 for given signal points @xmath28 .",
    "note that at least @xmath29 signal points are required to solve the nonlinear set of equations . as the number of frequencies in the band - limited signal is relatively small ( @xmath30 ) several methods , which otherwise would be numerically unstable , can be applied , e.g.  linear predictor , pad approximant , or direct signal diagonalization @xcite . here , we resort to the pad approximant .",
    "let us assume for the moment that the signal points @xmath28 are known up to infinity , @xmath31 . interpreting the @xmath28 s as the coefficients of a maclaurin series in the variable @xmath32",
    ", we can define the function @xmath33 . with and the sum rule for geometric series",
    "we obtain @xmath34 the right - hand side of is a rational function with polynomials of degree @xmath12 in the numerator and denominator . evidently , the parameters @xmath27 are the poles of @xmath35 , i.e. , the zeros of the polynomial @xmath36 . of course ,",
    "the assumption that the coefficients @xmath28 are known up to infinity is not fulfilled and , therefore , the sum over all @xmath37 in can not be evaluated in practice .",
    "however , the convergence of the sum can be accelerated by use of the pad approximant .",
    "indeed , knowledge of @xmath25 signal points @xmath38 is sufficient for the calculation of the coefficients of the two polynomials @xmath39 the coefficients @xmath40 with @xmath41 are obtained as solutions of the linear set of equations @xmath42 once the @xmath40 are known , the coefficients @xmath43 are given by the explicit formula @xmath44 the parameters @xmath45 $ ] and thus the frequencies @xmath46 ( choosing the branch of the logarithm with @xmath47 ) are obtained by searching for the zeros of the polynomial @xmath36 in .",
    "this is the only nonlinear step of the algorithm .",
    "the roots of polynomials can be found , in principle , by application of laguerre s method @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that an alternative method , i.e.  the diagonalization of the hessenberg matrix @xmath48 with @xmath40 the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath36 in , is a numerically more robust technique for finding the roots of high degree ( @xmath49 ) polynomials @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath50 are calculated via the residues of the last two terms of .",
    "application of the residue calculus yields @xmath51 with the prime indicating the derivative @xmath52 .",
    "note that @xmath53 vanishes if @xmath27 is a multiple root of the polynomial @xmath36 and thus equation is not valid for degenerate resonances occurring at exceptional points . in the following",
    "we extend the harmonic inversion method to include that case .",
    "degenerate resonances can not be described by simple poles of the function @xmath7 but higher order poles are required .",
    "therefore , the ansatz is generalised to @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the order of degeneracy of resonance @xmath56 .",
    "note that resonances with @xmath57 in spectra given as @xmath58 have a non - lorentzian line shape .",
    "the aim is now to extract the complex resonance positions @xmath3 and amplitudes @xmath59 from a given spectrum .",
    "the first step is again the computation of a band - limited time signal by a windowed fourier transform of @xmath7 .",
    "writing @xmath7 in as @xmath60 we obtain @xmath61 where the sum over @xmath56 is now restricted to those resonances with @xmath62 $ ] . at discrete grid points @xmath63 ( with @xmath18 ) the signal reads @xmath64 \\ ; .\\ ] ] with the abbreviations @xmath65\\ ] ] we finally obtain the nonlinear set of equations @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the total number of resonances of the band - limited signal counting all multiplicities .",
    "the second step , i.e.  the solution of the nonlinear set of equations , also starts analogously to the non - degenerate case . interpreting the @xmath28 s in as the coefficients of a maclaurin series in @xmath32 given for @xmath68 we now obtain @xmath69 the rational function with the polynomials @xmath70 and @xmath36 on the r.h.s .  of is obtained in the same way as in using equations - .",
    "the parameters @xmath27 are the roots of the polynomial @xmath36 , however , the difference to the non - degenerate case is that now each root @xmath27 is @xmath55-fold degenerate .",
    "for @xmath71 the sum on the l.h.s .  of is no longer a simple geometric series . in the following we use the relation ( see appendix ) @xmath72 with @xmath73 the stirling numbers of the second kind @xcite , and the functions @xmath74 a few stirling numbers @xmath75 for @xmath76 are given in table [ tab1 ] .    .stirling numbers of the second kind @xmath75 for @xmath76 . [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     as the complex energies @xmath77 and",
    "@xmath78 do not exactly coincide the two corresponding amplitudes @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be computed with equation valid for non - degenerate resonances .",
    "however , it should be noted that roughly @xmath81 , i.e.  both amplitudes cancel each other to a large amount .",
    "the values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 strongly depend on the distance between the two nearly degenerate resonances and diverge at the exact ep where @xmath82 .",
    "it is therefore more appropriate to describe the resonance in figure  [ fig1 ] using the ansatz for a non - lorentzian line shape .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath83 and @xmath84 in table  [ tab2 ] have been computed with for a twofold degenerate resonance at the mean energy @xmath85 .",
    "the lorentzian part of the resonance related to a first order pole in and the non - lorentzian part related to a second order pole in are shown as grey dashed and blue dotted line in figure  [ fig1 ] , respectively , and the sum of the two contributions ( red dashed line ) reproduces the total photoabsorption cross section ( black solid line ) very well .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath83 and @xmath84 only weakly depend on how closely the exact ep is approached and , in particular , do not diverge at the ep .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that the extended harmonic inversion method introduced in section [ sec : hi_degenerate ] is not restricted to the case of exact degeneracies but is well suited even for the analysis of nearly degenerate resonances .",
    "furthermore , the method allows for the detection of an ep using a single spectrum .",
    "the contributions of both the first and second order pole in figure  [ fig1 ] are of similar size .",
    "the non - vanishing contribution of the second order pole provides clear evidence that the two resonance poles in the lower panel of figure  [ fig1 ] are related to a second order exceptional point .",
    "by contrast , the method of encircling the ep requires several spectra at various parameter values to observe the permutation of states as a fingerprint of the ep @xcite .",
    "the spectrum in figure  [ fig1 ] has been computed numerically , however , it is important to note that high - resolution spectroscopy of atoms in external fields allows for the experimental observation of exceptional points .",
    "the resolution of the experiment must be sufficiently high to resolve the line shapes of resonances and , in particular , to distinguish between lorentzian and non - lorentzian profiles .",
    "the harmonic inversion analysis of experimental high - resolution spectra is an alternative to the measurement of the survival probability @xmath86 of a decaying degenerate resonance @xmath87 , which has been excited with a laser whose bandwidth is large compared to the width of the resonance @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the extended harmonic inversion method can also be applied to adjust the measured survival probability to the functional form of the signal , and to detect , e.g. , a second order ep by the non - exponential decay of the survival probability @xmath88 with a parameter @xmath89 .      as a second example for the application of the extended harmonic inversion method we study the dynamics of a single particle with mass @xmath90 in a harmonic oscillator with changing frequency given by the hamiltonian @xmath91 it has been shown by uzdin @xcite that",
    "when the frequency is changed by keeping the dimensionless adiabatic parameter @xmath92\\frac{{\\rmd}\\omega(t)}{{\\rmd}t}\\ ] ] fixed , the time evolution features an exceptional point at @xmath93 .",
    "the variance of the position operator @xmath94 normalised by the width of the instantaneous potential @xmath95 as function of the renormalised time @xmath96 $ ] is given by the signal @xmath97 and illustrated for various values of @xmath98 in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "obtained as normalised variance of the position operator @xmath94 as a function of renormalised time of a particle in a time - dependent harmonic trap for various values of the adiabatic parameter @xmath98 . a transition from an oscillatory to a monotonically growing exponential dynamics occurs at @xmath93.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    the signal @xmath13 shows a sharp transition from an oscillatory to a monotonic exponential dynamics at @xmath93 , where three frequencies of the signal are identical . is this degeneracy a third order ep ?",
    "that question can not be answered with the established method of observing the permutation of the frequencies when the ep is encircled in the parameter space because the single control parameter @xmath98 of the system does not allow for such an encircling .",
    "uzdin @xcite propose to observe the third order derivative of the renormalised variance which should vanish at @xmath93 , where @xmath13 is a second order polynomial in @xmath99 .",
    "however , higher order derivatives of the experimentally measured signal may strongly suffer from noise .    as an alternative approach",
    "we suggest to use the extended harmonic inversion method to identify the ep unambiguously . for the analysis of signals it is convenient to write the signal @xmath13 defined in in the form @xmath100 with @xmath101 and to determine the frequencies @xmath3 and amplitudes @xmath102 with the extended harmonic inversion method .",
    "the results for the analysis of the signal are presented in figure  [ fig3 ] .     in as functions of the adiabatic parameter @xmath98 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath103 to @xmath104 in ( b ) obtained with equation for non - degenerate resonances diverge at @xmath93 , where the three frequencies in ( a ) coincide .",
    "by contrast , the amplitudes @xmath105 to @xmath106 in ( c ) obtained with equation for a threefold degenerate resonance are smooth functions around @xmath93 .",
    "the nonzero value @xmath107 in the region @xmath108 provides clear evidence , that the critical point is a third - order ep.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    the numerical procedure reveals that the signal possesses exactly three frequencies with nonzero amplitudes .",
    "the frequencies are shown in figure  [ fig3](a ) .",
    "evidently , @xmath109 is constant and @xmath110 and @xmath111 undergo a transition from purely real to purely imaginary frequencies at @xmath93 , which is directly related to the transition from an oscillatory to a monotonic exponential dynamics in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath103 to @xmath104 in figure  [ fig3](b ) obtained with equation for non - degenerate resonances diverge at @xmath93 , where the three frequencies coincide .",
    "by contrast , the amplitudes @xmath105 to @xmath106 in figure  [ fig3](c ) obtained with equation for a threefold degenerate resonance are smooth functions around @xmath93 .",
    "the nonzero value @xmath112 in the region @xmath108 provides clear evidence , that the critical point is a third - order ep .    in any realisation of the experiment proposed by uzdin @xcite the frequency @xmath113 of the time - dependent harmonic trap",
    "can certainly be varied only within a limited finite range , and thus the signal @xmath13 in figure  [ fig2 ] can not be measured at large values @xmath99 of the renormalised time .",
    "the results in figure  [ fig3 ] have been obtained by analysing the region @xmath114 $ ] of the signal .",
    "note that at small values of @xmath99 the signals belonging to different parameters @xmath98 become more and more similar ( see , e.g.  the signals with @xmath115 , @xmath93 , and @xmath116 in figure  [ fig2 ] ) and thus the extraction of the correct frequencies and amplitudes from a short signal is a nontrivial task .",
    "we have checked that signals with a short signal length down to @xmath117 are sufficient to clearly observe the degeneracy of the three frequencies at @xmath93 and to verify the nonzero amplitude @xmath118 indicating the third - order ep .",
    "furthermore , the harmonic inversion method is robust against a certain amount of noise in the signal @xcite . for these reasons the extended harmonic inversion method introduced in this paper",
    "is ideally suited to reveal exceptional points in experimentally measured signals .",
    "we have extended the harmonic inversion method to allow for the analysis of spectra and time signals with degeneracies . in the energy or frequency domain the parameters of non - lorentzian line shapes related to higher order resonance poles and in the time domain the parameters of non - exponentially decaying contributions to time signals can be extracted .",
    "the method has been applied to reveal exceptional points in the photoabsorption spectrum of the hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields and in the dynamics of a single particle in a time - dependent harmonic trap .",
    "the harmonic inversion analysis is an alternative to the observation of the permutation of states when the exceptional point is encircled in the parameter space .",
    "the advantage of the method is that it allows for the verification of an ep even in cases when appropriate parameters for the encircling of the ep are not available . in the future",
    "the extended harmonic inversion method can be used to observe exceptional points in a large variety of physical systems , including e.g.  electronic circuits , mechanical systems , atomic spectra , bose - einstein condensates , microcavities , and microwave resonators . in particular",
    "it will be interesting to use the method for the identification of exceptional points in systems in which they could be applied to manipulate the system .",
    "for example , exceptional points are discussed in molecular physics to prepare molecules in a defined vibrational level @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the ep distinguishes between the pt - symmetric and the pt - broken phase , and in @xcite it is shown that an ep can be used to shift an oscillator to an exponential decaying regime .",
    "here we present derivations of equations and for the series @xmath119 .",
    "we start with the formula @xmath120 which can easily be proved by induction : with the stirling numbers @xmath121 and @xmath122 we obtain @xmath123 with an index shift @xmath124 in the second term of the upper equation . using the recurrence relation @xmath125",
