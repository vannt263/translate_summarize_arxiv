    "eta production through electromagnetic interactions has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally . however , for @xmath0 production induced by weak interactions there are no results neither for the integrated cross section nor for distributions .",
    "its study is interesting because of several reasons .",
    "for example , @xmath0 is one of the important probes to search for the strange quark content of the nucleons  @xcite .",
    "also a precise determination of the @xmath0 production cross section would help in subtracting the background in proton decay searches . in some supersymmetric grand unified theories ,",
    "@xmath0 mesons provide a prominent signal for proton decay  @xcite .",
    "therefore , its background contribution due to atmospheric neutrino interactions should be well estimated .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 production channel is likely to be dominated by @xmath4 resonance excitation .",
    "this state sits near the threshold of the @xmath5 system and has large branching ratio into the @xmath5 channel .",
    "thus , a precise measurements of the cross section will also allow to determine the axial properties of this resonance .",
    "in addition , a second class ( via pion pole ) @xmath0 production mechanism that could compete with resonance production in certain kinematic conditions has been singled out  @xcite .",
    "finally , theoretical models like the present one allow to improve the monte carlo simulations used to analyze oscillation experiments .",
    "we have studied charged current ( cc ) @xmath0 production off the nucleon induced by ( anti)neutrinos .",
    "born terms are calculated using a microscopical model based on the su(3 ) chiral lagrangian .",
    "the basic parameters are @xmath6 , the pion decay constant , cabibbo s angle , the proton and neutron magnetic moments and the axial vector coupling constants for the baryon octet , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , that are obtained from the analysis of the semileptonic decays of neutron and hyperons .",
    "we also consider @xmath9(1535 ) and @xmath9(1650 ) @xmath3 resonant intermediate states .",
    "the vector form factors of the n-@xmath3 transition have been obtained from the helicity amplitudes extracted in the analysis of world pion photo- and electroproduction data with the unitary isobar model maid  @xcite .",
    "the properties of the axial n-@xmath3 transition current are basically unknown but assuming the pion - pole dominance of the pseudoscalar form factor , together with pcac one can fix the axial coupling using the empirical @xmath10 partial decay width .",
    "we make an educated guess for the dependence on the 4-momentum squared transferred by the neutrino , which ultimately remains to be determined experimentally .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we present the formalism for cc @xmath0 production in neutrino / antineutrino nucleon scattering based on the lagrangian of su(3 ) @xmath11pt and describe the input for the @xmath3 resonances .",
    "finally we discuss the results and summarize our study .",
    "the reactions for the charged current ( anti)neutrino induced eta production on free nucleons are @xmath12 the amplitudes for these processes are given in terms of the product of the leptonic and hadronic currents . the standard v -",
    "a current is taken for the leptonic part while for the hadronic current we consider tree level born diagrams ( s- and u - channels ) with intermediate nucleon and @xmath3 resonances .",
    "the non - resonant terms are obtained using the su(3 ) chiral lagrangian  @xcite at leading order .",
    "other contributions from this lagrangian are ruled out by the various symmetry arguments .",
    "we get @xmath13 where the subscripts @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the s- and u - channel diagrams .",
    "the upper ( lower ) sign in @xmath16 applies to the s-(u-)channel current . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mass and total decay width of the @xmath3 resonances while @xmath19 denotes the nucleon mass .",
    "the momentum transfer is denoted by @xmath20 while @xmath21 ; @xmath22 is the gauge coupling , which is related to the fermi coupling constant @xmath23 .",
    "the isovector form factors @xmath24 , are given in terms of the electromagnetic transition form factors of protons and neutrons as @xmath25 @xmath26 can then be obtained from the helicity amplitudes @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , which have been conveniently parametrized in ref .  @xcite . in our case",
    "@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the quality of the model and the sensitivity to the parameters can be tested against photo and electroproduction data .    for the axial form factor @xmath31 we have adopted a dipole form with @xmath32  gev .",
    "the pseudoscalar form factor is related to @xmath31 through the pcac relation @xmath33 in the numerical calculations we have used @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 from the corresponding off - diagonal goldberger - treiman relations .",
    "the coupling @xmath38 is obtained from the @xmath39 decay width calculated using the lagrangian @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the dirac fields for the nucleon and @xmath3 resonance respectively , while @xmath43 is the @xmath0 meson field . the total decay width for these two resonances",
    "is given by , @xmath44 here we would like to emphasize that there are large uncertainties in the parameters of the @xmath3 resonances including a large error bar in their decay widths .",
    "the cross sections ( @xmath45 ) corresponding to the amplitudes given in eq .",
    "[ eq : amp ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec ] for @xmath46 energy up to @xmath47  gev .",
    "we find that the @xmath48 resonance is dominant while the contribution of @xmath49 to the total cross section is small .",
    "this can be understood easily because @xmath4 is lighter and has a relatively larger branching ratio into @xmath50 than @xmath49 .",
    "the contribution of the non - resonant diagrams in case of neutrino induced cc process is higher than in the corresponding anti neutrino channels .",
    "also in neutrino mode the contribution of u - channel diagram is slightly larger than the corresponding s - channel diagram .",
    "furthermore , we have studied @xmath51 , lepton energy and angular distributions for these processes and the results would be communicated elsewhere .    to conclude , in this work we have studied the cc @xmath46 induced @xmath0 production on free nucleons .",
    "we find that the cross sections are large enough to be measured in experiments like t2k , no@xmath52a and miner@xmath52a .",
