    "launched respectively in 2004 and 2008 , _ swift _ and _ fermi _ jointly have become the primary workhorses for extensive studies of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . the burst alert telescope ( bat )",
    "onboard _ swift _ , with its 5200 @xmath0 detector area ( @xmath1 @xmath0 effective area ) can detect very faint bursts down to @xmath2 ( barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 ; gehrels et al . 2004 ) in the 15 - 150 kev band . due to rapid slew rate and high resolution instruments ,",
    "_ swift _ has enabled redshift measurement of many grbs .",
    "fermi hosts two instruments , namely gamma ray burst monitor ( gbm ) and large area telescope ( lat ) .",
    "gbm , the primary instrument for studying grb prompt emission , covers a wide energy band ( 8 kev - 40 mev ; meegan et al .",
    "2009 ) . together",
    "_ swift _ and _ fermi _ have provided a wealth of prompt emission data .",
    "swift has revealed that grbs are frequent at very high redshifts ( z ) .",
    "the highest spectroscopic z is 8.2 ( tanvir et al . 2009 ; salvaterra et al . 2009 ) , which corresponds to a very young universe , even less than 5% of its present age . the high z of these objects make them valuable as high - z luminosity indicators .",
    "indeed , correlations of some observables ( e.g. , source frame peak energy  @xmath3 , lag  @xmath4 , variability etc . ) with the energetics of a grb ( e.g. , isotropic equivalent energy  @xmath5 , isotropic peak luminosity  @xmath6 , collimation corrected energy  @xmath7 ) have been found and discussed in the recent years ( e.g. , fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ; norris et al .",
    "2000 ; amati et al . 2002",
    "; schaefer 2003 , 2004 ; ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004 ) . in principle , through these correlations an observable can be used to estimate the energetics and hence , the distance of the object .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that grbs can be used as `` standard candles '' in the same way as type ia supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "moreover , the redshift barrier can be pushed to a much higher value compared to sne ia .",
    "these correlations are , however , empirical in nature , and may arise due to instrumental selection biases ( e.g. , see nakar & piran 2005 ; band & preece 2005 ; schaefer & collazzi 2007 ; collazzi et al . 2012 ) .",
    "one way to confirm the reality of these correlations and understand the effect of selection biases is to examine the correlations within a grb .",
    "for example , ghirlanda et al . (",
    "2010 ) , using a set of 9 grbs with known redshifts , have shown that the @xmath3 - @xmath6 correlation , known as the yonetoku correlation ( yonetoku et al .",
    "2004 ) , holds within the time - resolved data .",
    "however , basak & rao ( 2012a ; br12a hereafter ) , using the same set of grbs , have shown that the @xmath3 - @xmath5 correlation ( amati correlation ; amati et al .",
    "2002 ) breaks down in the time - resolved data .",
    "they concluded that the amati correlation is not meaningful in time - resolved study .",
    "however , the fact that a grb is made up of broad pulses ( see e.g. , norris et al .",
    "2005 ) and that the spectrum evolves independently in the individual pulses demand that pulses should be analyzed separately .",
    "br12a used 22 pulses of these grbs and found that the amati correlation not only holds but it is better than the average amati correlation .    in this paper , we expand the pulse - wise study of grbs to include 43 pulses of 19 grbs .",
    "our main motivation is to establish that the pulse - wise correlation is suitable to use grbs as standard candles for cosmological studies .",
    "knowledge about the redshift evolution and other biases is very useful in this context .",
    "with a larger sample compared to that used in br12a , we can perform some critical tests .",
    "we first examine whether there is a redshift evolution of the pulse - wise amati correlation by dividing our sample in various redshift bins .",
    "this is very crucial because the correlation has to hold for various redshifts if we want to use grbs as `` standard candle '' at various redshifts .",
    "another interesting feature to be investigated is the dependence of the pulse properties in their sequence of occurrence which might put additional constraints for using a standard luminosity for a given pulse .",
    "it has been suggested that grbs tend to be harder at the beginning than the rest of the burst ( crider et al .",
    "1997 ; ghirlanda et al . 2003 ; kaneko et al . 2003 ; ryde and peer 2009 ) .",
    "this hardness should reflect in the peak energy of the spectrum . for a given energy ,",
    "the peak energy of the first pulses should be biased towards higher values and will tend to give a systematic shift in the peak energy luminosity correlation .",
    "we examine this possibility by dividing our sample into first / single pulses and rest of the pulses , and then studying the pulse - wise amati correlation for them .",
    "following is the plan of this paper . in section 2",
    ", we shall present our sample and the analysis technique .",
    "results are discussed in section 3 .",
    "major conclusions are discussed in section 4 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]    ) - log(@xmath5 ) data .",
    "the parallel thin lines are 3@xmath8 scatter of the data .",
    "the other thin lines are linear fit for the data in various redshift bins .",
    "markers are : boxes for z<1 , filled circles for 1<z<2 and open circles for z>2 bins .",
    "[ fig1],width=288 ]",
    "in table  [ table1 ] we show our set of grbs in chronological order .",
    "the redshifts are quoted from the web page of jochen greiner . in columns 4 and 5",
    "we specify the time interval for a given pulse . in the next three columns we show the parameters of band model fit .",
    "note that the low energy photon index ( @xmath9 ) sometime crosses the `` synchrotron line of death '' of electron slow cooling regime ( i.e. , the value of @xmath9 is greater than -2/3 ; preece et al .",
    "1998 ) . hence ,",
    "these models are either unphysical or the spectrum is not synchrotron ( zhang & meszaros , 2002 ) . however , the @xmath10 of the fits are acceptable .",
    "we are interested in measuring the average properties of the pulses , namely , peak of the ef(e ) spectrum and the bolometric flux .",
    "looking at the @xmath10 of the fits we can safely say that these values should not vary much for any other model which gives acceptable fit .",
    "the isotropic energy for the individual pulses are shown in the last column .    in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the scatter plot of @xmath3 vs. @xmath5 .",
    "the correlation coefficients are as follows : r=0.86 with @xmath11 , @xmath12=0.86 with @xmath13 .",
    "if we do not use the logarithmic values then the pearson correlation is 0.80 .",
    "we note that there is a significant correlation in pulse - wise amati data .",
    "note that due to larger sample with respect to br12a the significance of the correlation has improved ( previously @xmath14 was @xmath15 ) . to obtain the average amati correlation we use the data for these grbs , published by gruber et al .",
    "the correlation coefficients are r=0.83 with @xmath16 , @xmath12=0.85 with @xmath17 , and r without taking logarithmic values is 0.69 with @xmath18 .",
    "the thick line in figure  [ fig1 ] is the linear fit to the logarithmic values of pulse - wise amati data .",
    "the corresponding fit results are shown in table  [ table2 ] ( first row ) .",
    "note that the slope ( @xmath19 ) of the linear fit is @xmath20 , which gives an empirical relation as @xmath21 .",
    "the value of the slope ( @xmath19 ) and the intercept ( k ) for 22 pulses , reported by br12a , were @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the current values are : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath19 is within 0.36@xmath26 and k is within 0.36@xmath26 of the previous values .",
    "note that due to larger size of the present data , the values are now determined with better accuracy .",
    "however , the intrinsic scatter ( @xmath8 ) has increased to @xmath27 from @xmath28 , but still within 0.25@xmath26 of the old value . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , the lines parallel to the thick line show the 3@xmath8 scatter of the data .      in order to investigate the possible evolution with redshift of the pulse - wise @xmath3-@xmath5 correlation , we divide our data set in three redshift bins : ( i ) z<1 ( contains 17 data points ) , ( ii ) 1<z < 2 ( 16 data points ) and ( iii ) z>3 ( 10 data points ) . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show these different data by different markers .",
    "we fit the individual scattered data by a straight line as before .",
    "the thin lines represent these fits . in table",
    "[ table2 ] ( 2nd , 3rd and 4th row ) , we show the k,@xmath19 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 of these fits .",
    "we note that there are deviations of these lines from the average correlation line . however , the sample size is too low at present to conclude that these variations are significant . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the slope ( @xmath19 ; shown by filled boxes ) and the intercept ( k ; shown by filled circles ) of these linear fits as functions of z. as there are only three redshift bins , we can fit at most a straight line to the z-@xmath19 and z - k data .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  [ fig2 ] show the linear fits to the data .",
    "the slope of the z-@xmath19 fit is @xmath29 , while that of the z - k fit is @xmath30 .",
    "the errors quoted are nominal 90% errors .",
    "the average values of k and @xmath19 are shown by open circle and open box respectively .",
    "we note that there is an indication of evolution of the correlation . however ,",
    "the errors in @xmath31 and @xmath32 are large , and hence , the values are not statistically significant .",
    "redshift evolution of amati correlation and other prompt emission correlations have been studied by some researchers ( li 2007 ; tsutsui et al .",
    "2008 ; ghirlanda et al . 2008",
    "; azzam 2012 ) .",
    "they have reported mild evolution of the correlation .",
    "note that the evolution of tsutsui et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is monotonic , but figure  [ fig2 ] indicates that the there is no systematic evolution of the pulse - wise amati correlation .    to further investigate this matter , we divide our sample into low and high redshift bins .",
    "as there are different number of pulses in a given grb , the division is not exactly half .",
    "the lower redshift bin contains 23 pulses upto redshift 1.096 , and the other sample contains the rest .",
    "in figure  [ c1 ] , we have shown the @xmath33 contour of k and @xmath19 for these two redshift bins .",
    "the contour levels are 1@xmath26 for single parameter ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) , 1@xmath26 , 2@xmath26 and 3@xmath26 for two parameters",
    "( i.e , @xmath35 , 4.61 and 6.17 , respectively ) .",
    "note that they agree within @xmath34 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the present data is still consistent with no evolution , within statistical limit .",
    "yonetoku et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , for example , have studied both amati and yonetoku correlation in a set of 101 grbs from different detectors .",
    "they found that the yonetoku correlation has a redshift evolution at 2@xmath26 level , while the amati correlation has that at 1@xmath26 level . hence , the evolution of both amati and pulse - wise amati correlations are very weak and insignificant .",
    "we divide our sample into single / first pulses ( 19 data points ) and the rest of the pulses ( 24 data points ) .",
    "if the first / single pulses have harder spectrum , the peak energy for a given luminosity should have a bias towards higher value .",
    "we fit linear curves to the log(@xmath3 ) - log ( @xmath5 ) data for both the cases .",
    "the corresponding fit parameters are reported in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the correlation for first / single ( open boxes ) and the rest of the pulses ( open circles ) .",
    "the average linear fit to the full data is over - plotted as thick line .",
    "note that the intercept ( k ) of the first / single pulses ( @xmath36 ) is higher than the rest of the pulses ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "however , the slope ( @xmath19 ) is lower ( @xmath38 ) than the rest ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "note that @xmath40 , hence the bias is nullified by a combination . to investigate this further",
    ", we draw @xmath33 contour plot of k and @xmath19 for the two cases ( see figure  [ c2 ] ) .",
    "the blue contours at the right are those for the single / first pulses .",
    "the contour levels are the same as in figure  [ c1 ] .",
    "note that the two sets agree with each other within 1@xmath26 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the correlation is unaffected by the fact that the first / single pulses are harder .      in order to compare the pulse - wise amati correlation with the familiar time - integrated amati correlation",
    ", we use the recent results of nava et al .",
    "they have studied the time - integrated spectrum of 136 grbs with known redshift .",
    "we denote the slope as @xmath41 and the normalization by @xmath42 for their value to distinguish them from the present work . from nava",
    "et al . ( 2012 ) we quote the following values . ( a ) for the full set of 136 grbs @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "( b ) for a complete set of 46 grbs @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , ( c ) for the complementary sample of 90 grbs , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath50 .    in figure",
    "[ compare ] , we have shown together the data points of the pulse - wise analysis and the time - integrated @xmath3-@xmath5 correlation of the complete sample ( nava et al .",
    "we have shown the 3@xmath54 scatter in the time - integrated data by a shaded region .",
    "in our analysis , we have normalized the @xmath3 by 100 kev and @xmath55 by @xmath56 erg . converting this value to be compatible with the nava et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , we obtain @xmath57 , which is comparable those obtained by time - integrated analysis . the slope ( @xmath19 ) of the time - integrated correlation ( @xmath58 ) is also comparable to the pulse - wise correlation ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "to compare these correlations , we have plotted the time - integrated correlation line ( dashed line ) and the pulse - wise correlation line ( thick line ) . in order to find where the time - integrated data of the 19 grbs used for the present study lie",
    ", we also show the time - integrated values ( taken from david gruber  private communication ) by open circles .",
    "the linear fit to this time - integrated data is shown by dot - dashed line .",
    "note that , all these lines are comparable . though the pulse - wise amati correlation is comparable to the time - integrated correlation in terms of correlation coefficient , compared to the time - integrated correlation of nava et al .",
    "( 2012 ) pulse - wise amati correlation is tighter ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this points to the fact that pulse - wise correlation is indeed meaningful .",
    "to summarize , we have enlarged our sample twofold compared to br12a to study the pulse - wise amati correlation .",
    "we confirm that the correlation holds with a good correlation coefficient .",
    "we could divide our sample in various redshifts and study the same correlation in these redshift bins .",
    "we found no statistically significant evolution of the correlation with redshift .",
    "possibly a larger sample is needed to further investigate this matter . to check whether the correlation has a bias due to the fact that the first / single pulse have a tendency for higher peak energy ( @xmath60 )",
    ", we divided our sample into the first / single pulses and the rest of the pulses .",
    "we confirm that the correlation remains unaffected by such a bias .",
    "another interesting fact we notice from close inspection of figure  [ compare ] is as follows . the time - integrated and pulse - wise correlation",
    "are in general agreement with each other ( compare the thick line with the dashed line ) .",
    "however , the best fit line ( dot - dashed ) to the time - integrated data of 19 grbs ( present sample ) lies slightly lower than that of the pulse - wise data .",
    "though the slope of these lines are similar , their normalization is slightly different .",
    "the difference in the normalizations of the pulse - wise correlation and the time - integrated correlation can be understood as due to the summing of the individual pulses in the individual grbs .",
    "for example , if a grb has two pulses , the time averaged value of e@xmath61 would be the average value of individual e@xmath62 values of the pulses ( possibly biased towards the brighter pulse ) , whereas the value of @xmath5 would simply be the sum of individual pulse values .",
    "hence we can expect a shift in the data point towards right by about a factor of two .",
    "however , a larger sample is required to draw such conclusion , but at present , there is no significant evidence of different slope , dispersion and normalization between the `` two versions '' of the correlation .",
    "the present work strongly indicates that the amati correlation is a pulse characteristics rather than an average grb property .",
    "the strengthening of the amati correlation when taken pulse - wise is a clear vindication that the correlation is real and not due to any artifact of selection or observational biases",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate all grb prompt emission correlations taking individual pulses so that a very tight multi - parameter correlation could be obtained which will eventually lead to the use of grbs as standard candles for cosmology .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the heasarc online service , provided by the nasa / gsfc , in support of nasa high energy astrophysics programs .",
