    "the study of hot strongly - coupled dense charged fluids is a difficult task , especially near the regime of or molecular and atomic species@xcite , or excitons in electron - hole plasmas .",
    "the system is better understood for fully ionized systems , such as hydrogen , in the form of free electrons and protons , and fully - ionized electron - hole condensates .",
    "in fact , considerable headway has been made using methods based on density - functional theory ( dft ) , even for plasmas with multiple states of ionization .",
    "dft methods have been used with molecular - dynamics based approaches@xcite , as well as within multi - component integral - equation approaches @xcite .",
    "equilibrium properties of plasmas , as well as their linear transport properties , have been successfully studied in these papers , and excellent agreement between the molecular - dynamics based dft and integral - equation based dft has been found @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "laser - produced plasmas are initially formed as two - temperature plasmas , where the electrons have absorbed the laser energy and have self - equilibrated to some `` electron temperature '' @xmath0 , while the ions remain cool , at some temperature @xmath1 , with @xmath2 .",
    "the opposite situation arises in shock - wave generated plasmas , where the ions absorb the shock energy and @xmath3",
    ". such two - temperature plasmas also occur in astrophysical settings , affecting the time of termination of synthesis of light - nuclei to occur at different stages of cooling of the electrons@xcite , and influencing the coulomb nuclear - tunneling rates@xcite .",
    "the possibility of such well - defined two - temperature plasmas is largely a result of the extreme mass ratio @xmath4 between ions and electrons .",
    "similar , but less well defined situations can arise in electron - hole plasmas , where the masses are of the same order of magnitude ( e.g , the electron and hole masses in gaas are 0.067@xmath5 and 0.34@xmath5 respectively , with an electron - hole mass ratio of @xmath6 ) .",
    "gaas is a direct bandgap material , and electron - hole plasmas are more easily studied in indirect - gap systems like si where the density - of states mass ratio is @xmath7 .",
    "the simulation of such systems at two temperatures , using quantum monte - carlo methods is at present unavailable , even in regimes of densities and temperatures where bound states ( or exciton formation in electron - hole systems ) do not exist .",
    "thus it is natural to look for analytical methods based on integral - equation techniques which are computationally simple and physically insightful .",
    "however , although @xmath8 define the temperatures of each subsystem and the pair - distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the ` temperature ' @xmath11 entering into the cross - correlations @xmath12 , as well as the the effects of electron spin , exchange etc . ,",
    "relevant to two - temperature systems need to be clarified . in this context",
    "we use @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath11 to refer to the electron- , ion- , and electron - ion temperatures as they enter independently into the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) and hypernetted chain ( hnc ) equations .",
    "in fact , some authors@xcite have proposed to modify the well - established oz equations in dealing with two - temperature ( 2 t ) two - mass ( 2 m ) systems .",
    "the objective of this paper is to study such 2t-2 m plasmas using results from molecular - dynamics ( md)@xcite , hnc@xcite , classical - map hnc ( chnc)@xcite , quantum monte carlo ( qmc)@xcite and kohn - sham ( ks)@xcite methods to establish the proper implementation of quantum effects and 2 t , 2 m situations in simulation studies .",
    "one of our main interests would be uniform hydrogenic plasmas free of bound states , in the regime of warm - dense matter .",
    "a system of classical particles , e.g. , hard - spheres or lennard - jones fluids , or classical ions in a uniform neutralizing background , can be studied completely using the method of molecular dynamics ( md ) where the classical equations of motion are integrated numerically , for a sufficiently large number of particles contained in a simulation box .",
    "it has been found that the particle distribution functions , e.g. , the pair - distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 specify the species , spin etc . ) , obtained from md simulations for charged classical ions can also be accurately reproduced via suitable integral - equations which are computationally very economical and efficient .",
    "the pair - potentials , quantum corrections etc . , needed to simulate systems with ions and electrons , or purely electron systems ( with a uniform neutralizing background ) will be discussed in this section .",
    "first , we compare the usual hnc approximation with the chnc method .",
    "then , these results are compared with a full quantum ( kohn - sham ) calculation ; these results are then used to determine the effective diffractive interaction used in the chnc method .",
    "finally , we discuss how the chnc can be extended to `` classical map molecular dynamics '' ( cmmd ) .      the hnc equation and its straight - forward generalizations , coupled with the oz equation have lead to very accurate results for classical charged - particle interactions .",
    "the exact equations for the pdfs are of the form : @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the pair potential between the species @xmath16 .",
    "if the bridge function @xmath19 is set to zero we have the hnc approximation .",
    "then , given the temperature @xmath20 , the particle densities @xmath21 , and the pair - potentials @xmath18 , the pair - correlation function @xmath22 and the direct correlation function @xmath23 can be self - consistently obtained via the hnc and oz equations , which have the form @xmath24 this method already fails for strictly attractive potentials .",
    "thus , in simulations of electron - proton systems , @xmath25 has to be replaced by effective - potentials which attempt to incorporate quantum diffraction effects @xcite .",
    "even with purely repulsive potentials , classical simulations fail to incorporate fermi or bose statistics which begin to manifest as the density is increased and the temperature is lowered . a well established means of incorporating quantum effects is to derive integral equations from correlated - determinantal wavefunctions , as done in the feenberg approach@xcite .",
    "the resulting integral equations are very daunting , and in fact , not easy to use .",
    "quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) itself may be considered as an adaptation of the feenberg - functional to generate a statistical measure for the stochastic algorithms used in md .",
    "an alternative approach , using feynman paths instead of classical trajectories , provides another class of simulation techniques .",
    "however , these quantum simulation methods become computationally extremely heavy .",
    "such methods are best suited for the establishment of bench - mark results , and for the `` calibration '' of other methods which contain approximation schemes .",
    "in fact , the qmc techniques have been most useful in providing the `` exchange - correlation '' potentials @xmath26 needed in the kohn - sham density - functional theory ( dft ) equations .",
    "while dft is itself exact , one has to use results from qmc and such microscopic methods to model the unknown @xmath26 .",
    "given the @xmath27 , the inhomogeneous density distribution around a given particle can be calculated , and the pair - distribution is deduced from it .    the method followed here is to exploit the well established kohn - sham equations as the reference calculation , and determine the effective potentials to be used in the classical simulations of 2 t and 2 m systems .",
    "to this end we present comparisons of kohn - sham calculations of @xmath28 for h - plasmas with available qmc results to mutually validate these methods .",
    "another theoretical tool we use is the `` classical - map hnc '' , i.e. , chnc equations which incorporate quantum effects including fermion statistics via effective potentials and effective temperatures .",
    "the chnc has been extensively tested via comparisons with qmc results in 2-d and 3-d electron systems , and shown to provide excellent agreement , even at the extreme quantum limit of zero temperature@xcite .",
    "chnc uses a `` quantum temperature '' @xmath29 , which depends on the fermion density .",
    "if the physical temperature of the quantum fluid is @xmath30 , the distribution functions are obtained@xcite from a classical fluid at the temperature @xmath31 such that : @xmath32 the temperature @xmath29 is defined to be such that the classical coulomb fluid has the same exchange - correlation energy as the quantum fluid [ ] .",
    "dft assures us that only the true density distribution possesses the true exchange - correlation energy .",
    "thus , the charge distributions , i.e. , the pdfs obtained from chnc are found to be in excellent agreement with those from monte - carlo simulations of 2d and 3d systems .",
    "this agreement is obtained by including the exchange - hole of parallel - spin electrons as an effective potential , called in chnc the pauli exclusion potential @xmath33 .",
    "clearly , this is zero if @xmath34 . for @xmath35 spins ,",
    "the potential @xmath33 is such that the non - interacting pdfs , i.e. , @xmath36 are correctly recovered from the integral equations@xcite .",
    "thus , using atomic units where @xmath37 , the effective pair potentials @xmath18 are of the form : @xmath38 here @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a cut - off momentum defining a diffraction correction allowing for quantum effects . in the simplest formulation @xmath40 is the thermal de broglie momentum given by : @xmath41 the temperatures @xmath42",
    "entering into the hnc equations for the @xmath15 are given by : @xmath43 the large mass of the proton ensures that the diffraction correction , as well as the @xmath29 , is negligible for the proton - proton scattering process . a more complete approach to determining",
    "@xmath40 is to solve the corresponding kohn - sham equation for the two particles in the kohn - sham potential of the medium , and matching the @xmath40 so that the quantum and classical values of the pdf at contact are in agreement .",
    "the pauli exclusion potential is usually determined by inverting the hnc equations applied to the exactly known non - interacting quantum pdfs @xmath44 of the uniform electron fluid .",
    "here @xmath45 runs through @xmath46 , i.e. , a spin - resolved , two - component electron system is used .",
    "if @xmath47 , @xmath48 . in the absence of strong magnetic fields ,",
    "the spin - resolution is not needed in warm dense systems .",
    "treating the electrons as a spin - averaged one - component subsystem simplifies the simulations .",
    "due to the non - linearity of the inversion of the hnc relations given in eqs .",
    "[ paupot ] , the pauli exclusion potential for paramagnetic electrons is not a simple average of the pauli exclusion potentials of the spin - resolved cases .",
    "the corresponding pauli potential @xmath49 has to be extracted directly from the averaged @xmath50 .",
    "thus we have , for the spin - resolved and -unresolved cases : @xmath51+n_{ii}^0(r ) , \\\\   \\beta p_e(r )    & = & -\\ln[\\{g_{ii}^0(r)+1\\}/2]+n^0_{ii}/2 \\\\",

    "such bridge corrections are found to be very significant in the 2d electron fluid@xcite , but not for 3d electrons at densities and temperatures considered in this study .",
    "the chnc differs from hnc in the use of the pauli potentials and the quantum temperature @xmath29 when treating quantum fluids .",
    "also , the pair - potentials used in hnc have been constructed to agree with ks - charge profiles ( see below ) .",
    "hence any insights obtained for the two - temperature two - mass hnc can be easily transfered to the chnc .",
    "the two - temperature electron - ion plasma was discussed in a formal analysis by boercker and more@xcite , using a product form for the partition function . however , no comparisons of their results with actual simulations are available .",
    "the more general two - temperature two - mass hnc type equations have been discussed , most recently by seuferling et al.@xcite . using an analysis based on the bogoliubov - born - green - kirkwood - yvon ( bbgky ) hierarchy as well as some factorization assumptions , the authors of ref .",

    "[ oz1 ] , for the @xmath52 , the case @xmath53 is not correctly recovered .",

    "kohn - sham theory at finite temperatures@xcite states that the true one - particle density distribution of the system subject to an external potential is such that the free energy of the system is minimized .",

    "let @xmath54 and @xmath55 be the electron and proton charge densities around the proton at the origin .",

    "the positive charge scooped out to form the cavity is placed as a point charge at the origin , and forms the central proton .",
