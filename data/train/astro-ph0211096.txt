    "therefore , it is not surprising that over the last 70 years , starting with zwicky ( 1937 ) , much effort has been spent measuring the mass of clusters using a number of techniques .",

    "2000 ) , and observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( e.g. , grego et al .  2001 ) .",
    "these methods in general are expensive in terms of the observational resources required , especially at higher redshifts .",
    "there have been a number of comparisons made between the different methods for determining the mass of clusters .",
    "these include comparisons between the x - ray and strong lensing methods in cores of clusters ( e.g. , allen 1998 ; wu 2001 ) ; between the x - ray and weak lensing methods ( e.g. , smail et al .",
    "1997 ) ; and between the dynamical and x - ray methods ( e.g. , girardi et al .",
    "1998 ) . of particular interest",
    "is the detailed comparison of the first three of these methods using the cnoc1 ( canadian network for observational cosmology ) sample of clusters performed by lewis et al .",
    "their results demonstrated that consistent mass estimates outside the cluster core region can be obtained by the dynamical , x - ray , and weak lensing methods .",
    "naively , in the situation where light traces mass , the richness of a galaxy cluster should be a direct indication of its mass .",
    "furthermore , observationally speaking , richness should be a relatively inexpensive parameter to measure , requiring only direct images of moderate depth even for @xmath12 clusters .",
    "historically , however , richness has not been a well - defined , quantitatively measured parameter .",
    "yee & lpez - cruz ( 1999 , here after yl99 ) examined in detail the properties of the richness parameter @xmath0 , first used by longair & seldner ( 1979 ) for quantifying the environment of radio galaxies .",
    "@xmath0  is the amplitude of the galaxy - cluster center correlation function measured individually for each cluster , and basically scales as the net counts of galaxies normalized by the luminosity function and spatial distribution of the cluster galaxies ( see seldner & longair and yl99 ) .",
    "yee & lpez - cruz ( ly99 ) , using photometric catalogs of a large sample of low - redshift abell clusters , showed that with reasonably careful attention to the choice of the cluster galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) and background corrections , the @xmath0  parameter is a robust measure of the richness , producing systematics of only 10 to 20%  arising from the typical systematic uncertainties in the lf , the photometry , and the spatial distribution of the cluster galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the correlation of the optical richness of clusters with important cluster attributes such as mass , line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( @xmath13 ) , x - ray temperature ( @xmath6 ) and luminosity ( @xmath7 ) , and virial radius ( @xmath14 ) , using primarily the cnoc1 cluster redshift survey sample ( yee , ellingson , & carlberg 1996 ) , currently the largest set of homogeneous spectroscopic and photometric data of galaxy clusters at the moderate redshift range of 0.17 to 0.55 .",
    "we show that a well - defined and easily measurable richness parameter such as @xmath0  produces strong correlations with other global properties of galaxy clusters , allowing its use as an estimator for quantities such as velocity dispersion , mass , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "we demonstrate that @xmath0  and the more conventional @xmath6  and @xmath7  are good predictors of the virial mass of the clusters at the @xmath130% level , with @xmath0  and @xmath6  being somewhat superior to @xmath7 .",
    "the correlations of the optical richness parameter with these key properties make richness an important defining parameter for galaxy clusters .",
    "as we enter into an era of wide - field , deep optical imaging capability , more effective and efficient methods of finding galaxy clusters using optical techniques are being investigated and applied ( e.g. , gladders & yee 2000 ; kim et al .",
    "optical cluster surveys covering from tens to thousands of square degrees with sample size as large as @xmath15 clusters are becoming available ( e.g. , the red - sequence cluster survey , see yee & gladders 2001 ; the sdss , see bahcall et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the ability to use optical data alone , via richness , to estimate important quantities such as mass , velocity dispersion , and x - ray temperature and luminosity for clusters at large redshifts , becomes increasingly important in the characterization of cluster samples , as obtaining x - ray or comprehensive spectroscopic data becomes impractical for such a large number of clusters .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we briefly describe the optical and x - ray data sets .",
    "section 3 presents the measurements of the richness parameter @xmath0  for the clusters , including a comparison of the values determined using photometric and spectroscopic data .",

    "the cnoc1 cluster redshift survey is a multi - object spectroscopy survey conducted at the canada - france - hawaii 3.6 m telescope ( cfht ) of galaxies in moderately rich to rich clusters with a redshift range of 0.17 to 0.55 .",
    "the sample consists of 15 high x - ray luminosity einstein medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) clusters ( gioia et al .",
    "1990 ) plus abell 2390 .",
    "this sample has currently the most comprehensive and homogeneous optical and x - ray database , making it an excellent sample for the investigation of the correlations between cluster richness and other global properties .    the observational strategy and procedure and the data reduction techniques for the photometric and redshift catalogs of cluster galaxies are described in detail in yee et al .  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the complete catalogs contain about 2600 redshifts , of which about half are considered cluster members .",

    "photometry in gunn @xmath20 and @xmath21 is also available for all galaxies .",
    "an important feature of the cnoc1 redshift survey is the estimate of statistical weights for the redshift catalog objects .",
    "the redshift survey used a sparse sampling strategy of about 1 in 2 .",
    "the establishment of statistical weights of each galaxy as a function of magnitude , position , and color , allows the use of the redshift sample as a complete sample .",
    "velocity dispersions and dynamically determined masses for the clusters are presented in carlberg et al .",
    "the cluster ms0906 + 11 , shown to be a binary in velocity space , ( making proper dynamical analysis difficult ) , is excluded from the dynamical sample , leaving a total of 15 clusters ( table 1 ) .",
    "x - ray temperatures for the cnoc1 clusters were taken from the literature , primarily from mushotzky & scharf ( 1997 ) and henry ( 2000 ) .",
    "sources for other temperature measurements are listed in lewis et al .",
    "these temperatures are predominantly emission - weighted measures from the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) , without correction for non - isothermality in the cluster cores .",
    "x - ray luminosities for these clusters are estimated from those calculated by ellis & jones ( 2002 ) with an additonal correction for cooling flows .",
    "the ellis & jones luminosities include an additional aperture correction over the original luminosity estimates from gioia & luppino ( 1994 ) , particularly for clusters with large core radii . for clusters which are not listed in ellis & jones",
    ", we use a similar correction to estimate aperture - corrected emss luminosities .",
    "for this correction , core radii were taken from lewis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) from rosat high resolution imager ( hri ) observations to determine the spatial profiles of the x - ray emission .",
    "these estimates should be generally consistent with those from ellis & jones .",
    "the luminosity of abell 2390 was estimated from data from pierre et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and includes a similar aperture correction .",
    "we correct these emss luminosities to bolometric luminosities using @xmath22 values from dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) and temperatures derived from asca and chandra observations from the literature .",
    "an x - ray temperature is not available for ms1231 + 15 ; we assume a typical value of 6 kev for this correction .",
    "finally , we apply a rudimentary correction for the effects of core cooling flows , based on the hri spatial profiles from lewis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . for this correction ,",
    "the central regions of clusters with cooling flows were omitted from beta - model fits to the outer profiles and the excess flux over the fit was attributed to the cooling flow .",
    "these corrections may be a slight overestimate of the effects of the cooling flow , however , as the spatial profiles were performed in the slightly softer rosat energy band . however , these corrections are on the order of 2 - 19 percent of the total flux , and so represent a small additional uncertainty .",
    "the x - ray temperatures and luminosities are listed in table 1 .",
    "a significant amount of data exists for lower redshift abell clusters which can be used for comparison with the cnoc1 results .",
    "in particular , the locos ( low - redshift cluster optical survey ) sample of lpez - cruz & yee ( see lpez - cruz 1997 and yl99 ) provides a large homogeneous optical database for 46 abell clusters at @xmath23 .",
    "the photometric data , based on kpno 0.9 m ccd images in @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , were produced using the same procedure as that of the cnoc1 survey .",
    "we have culled from the literature data on velocity dispersion , @xmath6 , and @xmath7  for clusters in this sample to allow us to compare the correlations of richness with global properties for the moderate redshift cnoc1 sample with a zero redshift sample .",

    "we use the parameter @xmath0  ( see longair & seldner 1978 ; andersen & owen 1996 ; yl99 ) as an estimate for the richness of the clusters .",
    "the @xmath0  parameter , defined as the galaxy - cluster center correlation amplitude ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) , essentially measures the net number of galaxies in a cluster within some fixed aperture , scaled by a luminosity function and a spatial distribution function .",
    "yee & lpez - cruz ( yl99 ) have shown using a large sample of low - redshift abell clusters that @xmath0  is a robust richness estimate , given that the photometry is accurate to @xmath28 mag and the lf of cluster galaxies is known and universal to within about 20% accuracy in the schechter function parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , they also showed that @xmath0  values computed using different absolute magnitude limits ( but at least approximately a magnitude past @xmath29 ) and different sampling radii are stable to within the uncertainty .",
    "yee & lpez - cruz also provided a calibration of the @xmath0  value to the more traditional abell richness class .",
    "if the evolution of the cluster galaxy lf is known , @xmath0  effectively allows the uniform computation of cluster richness for different redshifts , providing a powerful parameter for the comparison of cluster samples spanning a significant redshift range .",
    "we measure the @xmath0  parameter for the cnoc1 clusters via two methods : using the photometric catalogs and the redshift catalogs .",
    "this allows us to verify the accuracy of the photometric method which uses a statistical background count correction .      in the standard photometric method ( see , e.g. , yl99 ) we count galaxies to a fixed absolute magnitude within a standard cluster - centric radius and correct the expected background counts to obtain the net counts .",
    "we follow the prescription of yl99 for k - correction , and count galaxies to a k- and evolution - corrected @xmath31 of 20.0 over a radius of 0.5 @xmath2 mpc ( physical ) .",
    "we note that by counting to a relatively small radius , uncertainties arising from projection and stochastic background variations can be kept to a minimum . for background correction ,",
    "we use counts in the @xmath20 band generated from images of five randomly pointed fields observed during the cnoc1 survey .",
    "the absolute magnitude limit is chosen to be about 2 magnitudes below @xmath29 , which is a relatively slowly varying part of the lf , providing the most stable result ( see yl99 ) .",
    "the position of the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) is chosen as the center of the cluster in the computation of the @xmath0  parameter ( with the bcg itself not included as part of the excess counts ) .",
    "we note that in most cases the bcg can be determined unambiguously without redshift membership information by choosing the brightest galaxy on the red - sequence of the early - type galaxies of the cluster on a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "carlberg et al .  ( 1999 ) show that for the cnoc1 clusters , the choice of using the bcg or galaxy density centroid as the center of the cluster produces minimal effect on the determination of the profile of the galaxy cluster . the use of the bcg as the center for the computation of @xmath0  provides the advantage of simple consistency that can be easily applied .",
    "an important input in the estimate of @xmath0  is the cluster galaxy lf and its evolution over the redshift range of the sample .",
    "ideally , the most robust result is obtained when the lf ( and its evolution ) is determined directly from the cluster sample itself . however , despite being the currently largest cluster galaxy redshift sample at these intermediate redshifts , the cnoc1 sample is not sufficiently large at the higher redshift end to determine a statistically significant lf evolution measurement .",
    "thus , we use the estimated cnoc2 overall field galaxy luminosity evolution ( lin et al .  1999 ) with @xmath32 , where we adopt @xmath33 for the cluster galaxy lf .",
    "the zero redshift lf is taken to be a schechter function of @xmath3421.9 , and @xmath35 , which is the lf used by yl99 transformed to the gunn system .",
    "we note that because @xmath0  is derived using the relatively bright part of the galaxy lf , differential effects between the field and cluster galaxy lfs should be small . using the three different lfs listed in yl99 produces less than @xmath36% variations in the @xmath0  values .",
    "furthermore , adjusting @xmath37 by @xmath3830% does not change the relative @xmath0  values of the high and low redshift clusters significantly .",
    "the resultant @xmath0  measurements are listed in table 1 , along with their estimated abell richness classes .",
    "the @xmath0  values , in units of @xmath39 mpc@xmath40 can be roughly calibrated to the abell richness class scale as follows ( yl99 ) : abell 0 : @xmath41 ; abell 1 : @xmath42 ; and abell 2 : @xmath43 .",
    "the cnoc1 sample offers the unique opportunity to verify the robustness of photometrically determined richness parameters with those determined using a redshift sample .",
    "this allows us to test the validity and accuracy of statistical background corrections .",
    "we determine the @xmath0  parameters for the clusters using the same basic procedure as that for the photometric measurements . here",

    "1996 ) to arrive at the estimated net counts .",
    "in general the spectroscopic @xmath0 s are determined using absolute magnitude limits brighter than 20 ( due to the relatively bright spectroscopic limits ) , and hence have larger uncertainties despite not having to correct for background counts .",
    "the @xmath0  values derived from the spectroscopic sample are plotted versus the photometric @xmath0  in figure 1 .",
    "there is a very strong correlation between the two measurements with a slope close to the expected unity .",
    "the scatter in the relation is consistent with the estimated uncertainties . from this",
    "we can conclude that @xmath0  values determined using photometric data with statistical background count corrections are reliable estimates of cluster richness , even to redshifts of @xmath44 .",
    "this further demonstrates that photometric @xmath0  is a robust richness parameter .",
    "the richness parameter @xmath0  scales with the net counts of galaxies to some fixed luminosity within a certain radius . by making the simplifying assumption that galaxy clusters have similar galaxy luminosity functions at the bright end ( e.g.",
    ", lpez - cruz 1997 found that @xmath29 for the locos sample has a scatter of @xmath45 mag ) , galaxy spatial distributions , and mass - to - light ratios ( e.g. , carlberg et al .  1996 ) , @xmath0  is then expected to track the mass of clusters , and essentially measures the scaling of the spatial distribution of galaxies around the center of the cluster .",
    "hence , @xmath0  scales as the mass of clusters at a _ fixed _ proper radius .",
    "however , this is not an interesting correlation , as mass measures such as @xmath46 , the virial mass , or @xmath47 , ( the mass interior to @xmath48 , where the average mass density is 200@xmath49 ) , are connected more directly to observational quantities such as @xmath13 and @xmath6 .",
    "we can derive the links between @xmath0  and these properties using the following scaling relations .    assuming a correlation function form of @xmath27 and that galaxies trace the total mass",
    ", we expect the mass density @xmath50 , and hence the mass interior to some radius @xmath20 , @xmath51 .",
    "the mass of a cluster at some fixed fiducial radius @xmath52 is related to the virial mass @xmath46 at radius @xmath14 by @xmath53 . in the virialized region , @xmath54 ( e.g. , see carlberg et al .",
    "1996 ) and @xmath55 .",
    "hence , we expect the simple relationship : @xmath56 and @xmath57 note that the same relationship holds for @xmath47 .",
    "since for a virialized system @xmath58 ( e.g. , see horner et al .",
    "1999 ) , we also expect : @xmath59 finally , another important parameter for clusters is @xmath48 , which provides one with a physical size scaling of clusters of various richness . since @xmath60",
    ", we have : @xmath61    we note that for computing @xmath0  we have chosen to use @xmath62 , primarily to allow for a direct comparison with the galaxy - galaxy correlation amplitude .",
    "analyses of correlations between galaxies and clusters have shown that @xmath63 is typically steeper than that for galaxy - galaxy correlation functions , varying from 1.8 to 2.4 ( e.g. , lilje & efstathiou 1988 ; moore et al .",
    "1994 ; croft , dalton , & efstathiou  1999 ) , with the low value corresponding to the correlation between clusters and iras galaxies .",
    "however , for the purpose of using the correlation amplitude as a measure of richness , a shallower @xmath63 of 1.8 is likely the more appropriate one , due to the small cluster - centric radius used for the counting of galaxies .",
    "the @xmath63 s derived for galaxy - cluster correlations are generally measured over scales of 10 @xmath2 mpc or more , compared to 0.5 @xmath2 mpc used for the estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "these correlation function slopes essentially reflect the dependence of cluster profiles at large radii .",
    "profiles such as nfw ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ) and hernquist models ( hernquist 1990 ) typically have a form of @xmath64 at large @xmath20 , and asymptotically approach @xmath65 , similar to the measured correlation functions . at smaller radii , however , cluster profiles in general have flattening slopes , possibly leading to a core . at the typical 0.5 @xmath2 mpc where @xmath0  is measured ( equivalent to @xmath66 ) ,",
    "a @xmath63 of 1.8 is a reasonable representation .      in this section",
    "we examine the correlation of the richness of the cnoc1 clusters with quantities derived from optical data , such as velocity dispersion , mass , and @xmath48 .",
    "the main motivation in deriving these dependences is to use @xmath0 , an easily measurable parameter using just imaging data , as a predictor of the other quantities .",
    "hence , we fit expressions of these quantities as a function of @xmath0 .    the @xmath0  parameter provides an excellent correlation with velocity dispersion .",
    "we plot in figure 2 the correlation of velocity dispersion ( from carlberg , yee , & ellingson 1997 ) vs the photometric @xmath0  richness parameter using linear scaling , and in figure 3 using logarithmic scaling . in the plots , there is one cluster which stands out as an outlier : ms1455 + 22 , which has too large a velocity dispersion for its richness .",
    "we exclude ms1455 + 22 from all our fits , but include it in the plots .",
    "we further discuss the case of ms1455 + 22 in  5 . using the bisector bces estimator fitting routine ( which allows for measurement errors in both variables ; akritas & bershady 1996 ) in logarithmic space",
    ", we obtain a fit plotted as a dashed line in figure 3 : @xmath67 where @xmath13 is in units of km s@xmath5 , and @xmath0 , in units of @xmath39mpc@xmath40 .",
    "the fit is equivalent to @xmath68 , entirely consistent with the expected relation of eqn 1 for @xmath62 .",
    "we note that varying @xmath63 in the derivation of @xmath0  produces values that are simply scaled by the integration constant @xmath69 ( defined in longair & seldner 1979 ) , and does not affect the power - law slope of the fit .",
    "hence , the correlation between velocity dispersion and @xmath0  indicates that the @xmath63 used is consistent with the galaxy density slope near 0.5@xmath2 mpc .",
    "since the data span a factor of only @xmath70 in richness , we also perform a linear fit over the data range to provide a convenient formula for estimating the velocity dispersion from @xmath0 : @xmath71 in the range of @xmath72 . in figure 2 , we plot both the linear and power - law fits between @xmath13 and @xmath0 .    in figures 4 and 5 ,",
    "we plot in logarithmic scale the relationship between @xmath0  and @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with the following best bces fits : @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath47 is in units of @xmath75 , and @xmath48 , in units of @xmath2 mpc .",
    "these correlations are equivalent to @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , in excellent agreement with the expected values of 0.60 and 1.8 for @xmath62 .",

    "the rms deviation is increased to 176 km s@xmath5 ( or 20% ) , with the reduced @xmath90 increased to 1.3 .",
    "similar results are obtained when using the linear relation of eqn 6 , but with larger reduced @xmath90 of 1.4 and 2.4 for with and without ms1455 + 22 , respectively .",

    "the relatively small @xmath90 and fractional scatter suggests that , with the exception of ms1455 + 22 , the @xmath13 vs richness relation is consistent with little or no intrinsic scatter beyond the measurement uncertainties , and @xmath0  can be used as a reasonably accurate estimator of velocity dispersion .    for the dynamically derived quantities , such as mass and @xmath48 ,",

    "the reduced @xmath90 s are 0.83 and 2.0 for the @xmath47 and @xmath48 relation , respectively .    in general the correlations between richness and x - ray quantities have somewhat larger @xmath90 s .",

    "however , a relatively large reduced @xmath90 of @xmath96 is obtained for the best fit , indicating that there may be a significant intrinsic variance in the @xmath6  vs richness relationship . or",
    "alternatively , this scatter could be an indication that there may be systematic uncertainties in the @xmath6  determinations not taken into account by the error bars listed in the literature .",
    "the correction of @xmath6  for cooling flows and departures from isothermal conditions is a complicating issue ( e.g. , see allen 1998 ; lewis et al .",
    "1999 ) , and may contribute to the larger @xmath90 . removing the three additional clusters with the most prominent cooling flows ,",
    "a scatter of 1.2 kev about the best fitting relation with a reduced @xmath90 of 1.2 is obtained , indicating that cooling flows in clusters may be an important source of the larger scatter seen in this relationship .",
    "the correlation between @xmath7  and @xmath0   has the largest scatter .",
    "the reduced @xmath90 ( excluding ms1455 + 22 ) of the best fit is @xmath97 , and the rms scatter of the data from the fit is 47% . removing the three additional cooling flow prominent clusters improves the goodness of fit only marginally .",

    "hence , it is useful to examine the correlations between @xmath6  and @xmath7  with the dynamically derived @xmath47 of this sample , and compare their relative merits as estimators of mass to that of @xmath0 .",
    "figure 9 shows the excellent correlation between @xmath6  and @xmath47 , with the best power - law fit : @xmath98 where @xmath47 is in units of @xmath99 , and @xmath6  in units of kev .",

    "the correlation is consistent with a linear relationship between @xmath7  and mass .",

    ", we would expect @xmath105 , which is within 1.5 sigma of the relation obtained here with the cnoc1 sample .",
    "if we use the measured @xmath106 , we would predict @xmath107 , in good agreement with the measured correlation . in investigations of available x - ray data of galaxy clusters",
    ", it has been found in general that @xmath108 ( e.g. , markevitch 1998 ; allen & fabian 1998 ; arnaud & evrard 1999 ; see babul et al .",
    "2002 for detailed modeling of the @xmath6@xmath7  relation ) .",
    "the current data set produces a scaling of @xmath109 , consistent with the correlations found for high temperature systems ( e.g. , allen , schmidt , & fabian 2001 ; babul et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the cnoc1 sample has shown that all three quantities : richness , x - ray temperature , and x - ray luminosity , correlate well with the derived dynamical mass . here",
    ", we compare the relative merits of these quantities as predictors of the mass of galaxy clusters .",
    "the @xmath0  parameter produces a scatter in the predicted @xmath47 around 31% , with a reduced @xmath90 of 0.83 .",
    "this compares with a scatter in @xmath47 of 29% and a reduced @xmath90 of 1.6 for the @xmath6@xmath47 relation , and a scatter of 35% and a reduced @xmath90 of 2.8 for @xmath7 , all computed without ms1455 + 22 .",
    "thus , all three quantities can serve as good predictor of the cluster dynamical mass to the level of @xmath8% , with @xmath6  and @xmath0  being somewhat superior to @xmath7 . however , we note that the proper determination of the bolometric @xmath7  is not a simple procedure , and in fact _ requires _ the knowledge of @xmath6  and the x - ray emission spatial profile .",
    "x - ray luminosities derived without careful attention to spatial and spectral distributions produce a much poorer correlation with mass and other quantities than shown here .",
    "hence , @xmath7  is not as useful an estimator of cluster mass as @xmath6  or @xmath0 .",
    "that optical richness can predict the mass of clusters as accurately as x - ray properties is not entirely surprising .",
    "carlberg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) showed that for the cnoc1 sample @xmath110 , the luminosity within @xmath48 , is well correlated with velocity dispersion .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , using a large sample of low - redshift clusters , also found a good correlation between the @xmath26 band luminosity within the viral radius and virial mass with @xmath111 .",
    "however , neither of these luminosity measurements is a simple quantity to derive directly from photometric data alone , as it requires the knowledge of the virial radius or @xmath48",
    ". the derivation of @xmath0  does not require the knowledge of the size of the cluster because it assumes a fixed form of the density function .",
    "furthermore , such an assumption allows one to estimate the characteristic size of the cluster ( e.g. , @xmath48 ) .",
    "the correlation between @xmath0  and dynamical mass derived here spans only a small mass range of about a factor of 10 .",
    "there is a significant amount of both observational and theoretical evidence that , at least at lower masses , the assumption of a constant mass - to - light ratio is not a valid one ( e.g. , carlberg et al .",
    "2001 ; girardi et al .",
    "2002 ; bahcall et al .",
    "this will affect the @xmath0mass correlation , and thus , the scaling relations between @xmath0  and @xmath13 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 derived in  4 probably can not be extrapolated into a mass regime much smaller than @xmath112 .",
    "further calibrations of these relations are needed using a larger mass range .",
    "the galaxy cluster ms1455 + 22 is a significant outlier to most of the correlations discussed in  4 : it has either too low a @xmath0  value ( by about a factor of three ) for its velocity dispersion , too high a velocity dispersion ( by about a factor of two ) for its richness , or a combination of both . in the distribution of mass - to - light ratios of the cnoc1 clusters ,",
    "ms1455 + 22 also stands out with an anomalously large ( at the 2@xmath113 level ) value of 807 @xmath114 m@xmath115/l@xmath115 , compared to the mean of 295 @xmath114 m@xmath115/l@xmath115 for the whole sample ( carlberg et al .",
    "1996 ) . in many ways",
    "it is not surprising to find outliers to the correlations .",
    "galaxy clusters are complex systems ; differential evolution and events such as major mergers should produce intrinsic variances to these relations .",
    "hence , it is of interest to examine clusters that are significantly discrepant from the average population .",
    "ms1455 + 22 itself appears to be a very evolved cluster with a luminous and large central galaxy , a well - formed red sequence with a relatively small blue fraction ( 0.15 ; ellingson et al .",
    "2000 ) , and regular x - ray morphology ( lewis et al .  1999 ) .",
    "in addition , it has one of the largest cooling flow measurements in the x - ray ( lewis et al .",
    "the fact that the spectroscopic and photometric @xmath0 s agree within the uncertainties indicates that the @xmath0  value is not affected by an unusually low background count . if @xmath0  is anomalously low compared to other clusters , one possible explanation is that ms1455 + 22 is in a more advanced state of evolution than the others , as suggested by the large cooling flows , the strong red sequence , and the dominant central galaxy .",
    "the dominant central galaxy of ms1455 + 22 could contribute to the low @xmath0  value by having cannibalized a larger number of its bright members , leaving a lower net cluster galaxy counts .",
    "the more evolved galaxy population could produce a lower average luminosity for the galaxies , which again may produce a smaller @xmath0  value .",
    "however , the small number statistics of the redshift sample are not sufficient for us to draw definitive conclusions regarding the lf of the galaxies .",
    "the velocity dispersion for ms1455 + 22 was determined using 51 cluster galaxies ( carlberg et al .",
    "1996 ) , and hence is expected to be relatively robust",
    ". nevertheless , there are indications that the 1196 km s@xmath5 value could be somewhat high .",
    "one indication can be found in the @xmath13 vs @xmath6  plot where ms1455 + 22 has a high velocity dispersion for its @xmath6 , while in the @xmath6  versus @xmath0  correlation ms1455 + 22 is not particularly discrepant .",
    "however , a typical cooling flow correction may bring @xmath6  to a better agreement with the velocity dispersion .",
    "second , borgani et al .",
    "( 2000 ) applied several different methods to the cnoc1 data in determining the velocity dispersion , showing that the results , as a sample , are consistent .",
    "however , the different methods in borgani et al .  produced consistently lower @xmath13 for ms1455 + 22 , ranging from 962 km s@xmath5 to 1033 km s@xmath5 .",
    "( we note that using the different velocity dispersion derivations in borgani et al .",
    "produce essentially the same correlations with @xmath0 , but with somewhat larger scatter , with ms1455 + 22 being a less discrepant point . )    finally , in comparing the masses determined using x - ray data and weak lensing , lewis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that while the dynamical mass of ms1455 + 22 is consistent with the weak - lensing mass , it is 1.34 times that of the x - ray mass .",
    "since weak lensing tends to over estimate cluster mass on the average ( lewis et al .  1999 ) , this may suggest that the dynamical mass of ms1455 + 22 is somewhat high .    in summary , current data",
    "do not provide a single clear explanation of the discrepancy of ms1455 + 22 in an otherwise tight correlation of @xmath13 with @xmath0 .",
    "there is some evidence that the velocity dispersion may be somewhat high , but not sufficient to account for a factor of two .",
    "an intriguing suggestion is that the @xmath0  value is significantly low due to the cluster being in an evolutionary state different from the others , with more evolved galaxies and a very dominant central galaxy .",
    "the cnoc1 sample is one of the most homogeneous samples for investigating the correlations of various properties .",
    "the parent sample of the cnoc1 sample is the emss ( with one additional abell cluster with similar x - ray properties ) , which at the time when cnoc1 was carried out was the largest and most homogeneous x - ray cluster catalog .",
    "both the optical and x - ray data ( yee et al .  1996 , and lewis et al .",
    "1999 ) were obtained in a systematic manner and predominantly from a single source .",
    "nevertheless , the cnoc1 sample is very small , and it would be instructive to see if a larger sample of clusters with data coming from more heterogeneous sources follow these correlations",
    ". such a comparison will give confidence on the use of these relationship as predictors of various cluster properties .",
    "an excellent set of clusters for such a comparison is the locos sample of lpez - cruz and yee ( see lpez - cruz 1997 and yl99 ) . the locos is an imaging survey of 46 low - redshift abell clusters chosen from the compilation of x - ray detected abell clusters from jones & forman ( 1999 ) .",
    "the photometric catalogs were created using a procedure identical to that of the cnoc1 survey , with the exception that the @xmath25 filter band was used instead of gunn @xmath20 .",
    "we remove the small number of abell richness class 0 clusters from the locos samples , as the survey sampled fairly only clusters with richness class @xmath116 ( see yl99 ) .",
    "data for the velocity dispersion , @xmath6 , and @xmath7  are obtained from the literature .    for the correlation with velocity dispersion , we use data from fadda et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and girardi et al .",
    "yl99 showed a @xmath13 vs @xmath0  plot using all clusters with @xmath13 determined using 10 or more velocities , producing a correlation with a relatively large scatter . here",
    "we limit our @xmath13 data to those comparable to the cnoc1 survey , resulting in 16 clusters with @xmath13 measured using 25 or more velocities .",
    "the result is shown in figure 11 .",
    "plotted for comparison are both the cnoc1 points and the best cnoc1 fit .",
    "it can be seen that the abell data points fall on the relation on average , albeit with a somewhat larger scatter than the cnoc1 clusters , with the most discrepant clusters being at lower richness .",
    "the deviation of the abell cluster @xmath13 s from that predicted by their @xmath0  has a rms scatter of 170 km s@xmath5 , and an offset of 55 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the scatter is equivalent to 17% of the average velocity dispersion of the sample .",
    "the scatter is larger than the cnoc1 sample with ms1455 + 22 removed , but slightly smaller than the full cnoc1 sample .",
    "thus , using a completely different sample , selected with different criteria and with velocity dispersions obtained from different sources , we have found that the @xmath0  values can predict the velocity dispersion with an uncertainty of better than @xmath117% ( about 150 to 200 km s@xmath5 ) , and similar to that indicated by the cnoc1 sample itself .",
    "this demonstrates that the richness parameter @xmath0  is a useful predictor of the velocity dispersion of a cluster , and hence an estimator of its mass .",
    "the two low - velocity dispersion abell clusters which show the largest deviations from the fitted relation may be an indication of the nature of the abell cluster sample which favors finding clusters with projection contaminations .    for the correlation between richness and x - ray properties , we use the compilations of @xmath6  and @xmath7  from wu et al .",
    "figure 12 plots the @xmath6  vs @xmath0  relationship , with the cnoc1 data points and best fit indicated .",
    "the abell cluster points fall slightly below the cnoc1 relation , with a similar slope and a larger scatter , especially towards the low @xmath6  direction .",
    "however , we note that the most discrepant points are also the ones with the largest @xmath6  error bars , and most clusters are within 2@xmath113 of the regression line from the cnoc1 data .",
    "we find that the @xmath7  vs richness  relationship for the locos sample has the largest scatter of all the correlations discussed . when all locos clusters with available @xmath7  from wu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are plotted , there is only a very rough suggestion of a correlation ( figure 13 ) .",
    "a closer examination shows clearly that the magnitude of the scatter in the data is a strong function of the redshift of the cluster , with the largest scatter belonging to clusters at the low end of the redshift range of the sample . on figure 13 , we plot selectively the locos data for clusters with @xmath118 .",
    "the scatter is large , as indicated above , although the points basically fall along the relation found by the cnoc1 sample .",
    "the @xmath119 clusters are plotted as crosses , and it is clear that most of these objects have very significantly lower @xmath7  than that predicted by the cnoc1 relation .",
    "the much poorer correlation likely indicates the inhomogeneous nature of the @xmath7  data compiled by wu et al .",
    "there may also be systematic effects between the methods of @xmath7  determination used for the cnoc1 sample and the abell clusters . determining a consistent set of @xmath7  from a heterogeneous database",
    "is complicated , as data from different bands with different resolutions , aperture sizes , and signal - to - noise ratios are used .",
    "a number of @xmath119 clusters have @xmath7 s which are a factor of several lower than the expected value , which may arise from incorrect aperture corrections due to the large angular sizes of these very low - redshift clusters .",
    "we note that well - studied clusters at low redshift , such as abell 1656 ( coma ) , in fact do fall along the cnoc1 relation .    for both the @xmath6  and @xmath7  correlations with",
    "@xmath0  there is a tendency for the abell sample to fall below the cnoc1 regression line , indicating a larger @xmath0  relative to  @xmath6  or @xmath7 .",
    "this difference can arise from several sources , including simply the systematics in the data sets used .",
    "one interesting possibility is that this is an indication of the relative biases between cluster samples selected using x - ray and optical criteria .",
    "the abell sample is chosen via optical galaxy over - density , and hence favors high @xmath0  clusters , while the emss sample , being selected via x - ray fluxes , preferentially finds high x - ray luminosity , hot clusters .",
    "large homogeneous samples at similar redshifts and selected using both methods are needed to investigate the existence of such biases .",
    "using a small but homogeneous sample of clusters from the cnoc1 survey , we have demonstrated that the optical richness of the clusters , measured by the galaxy - cluster center correlation amplitude @xmath0 , correlates well with various global properties of the clusters . in particular , the correlation of @xmath0  with velocity dispersion is excellent , with a rms scatter of only 100 km s@xmath5 when a single outlier is removed , and 175 km s@xmath5 when the whole sample is used .",
    "the value of @xmath0  as an estimator of velocity dispersion is verified by using a sample of low - redshift abell clusters , producing a similar scatter around the best fit .    by extension , @xmath0",
    "is correlated with the dynamical mass ( as represented by @xmath47 ) and the virial size ( as expressed by @xmath48 ) of the clusters which are derived based on the velocity dispersion .",
    "similarly , @xmath0  shows a strong correlation with @xmath6 , and a somewhat more scattered correlation with @xmath7 .",
    "the forms of the correlations of the various properties with @xmath0  are consistent with scaling laws expected based on a simple spherical density distribution , providing confidence in the existence of the underlying correlations .",
    "we also compared the relative merits of @xmath0 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7  as estimators of the virial mass of the clusters .",
    "we find that all three produce reasonably tight correlations , with a scatter of @xmath8% .",
    "however , the good correlation of @xmath7  with mass is predicated on proper corrections to the @xmath7  determination , which require the knowledge of @xmath6  and the spatial distribution of flux , making @xmath7  a less useful predictor of mass .",
    "we note that the correlation of @xmath6  with dynamical mass is consistent with that found by other samples using masses determined via x - ray data .",
    "the correlations investigated here demonstrate that we should be able to use optical richness , a relatively inexpensive measurement , to estimate important attributes of a cluster .",
    "this method is especially powerful in view of the current capability of conducting large optical cluster surveys with improved cluster finding techniques .",
    "it allows samples of tens of thousands of clusters , for example , in a 1000 square degree survey , to be characterized .",
    "an important example of applications of these scaling relations is the determination of the mass function of galaxy clusters using large samples at different redshifts based on optical photometric data , being carried out by the red - sequence cluster survey out to @xmath12 ( gladders 2001 ; gladders & yee 2003 ) . a similar method of using total optical light to estimate cluster mass to derive the mass function of galaxy clusters at zero redshift has been applied by bahcall et al .  ( 2002 ) using imaging data from the sdss survey .",
    "the correlations discussed here are based on a small sample of clusters over a relatively wide range of redshift of @xmath120 . to be able to use these scaling relations reliably for clusters over a wide range of redshifts , it is important to further calibrate these correlations covering a number of redshift bins using comparable or larger samples from cluster surveys with well - understood selection functions .",

    "<S> richness is a key defining characteristic of a galaxy cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the optical richness of galaxy clusters from the cnoc1 cluster redshift survey using the galaxy - cluster center correlation amplitude @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the @xmath0  values measured using photometric catalogs are consistent with those derived from redshift catalogs , indicating that richness can be measured reliably from photometric data alone , even at moderate redshifts of @xmath10.6 . </S>",
    "<S> we establish the correlations between optical richness and other important attributes of a galaxy cluster , such as velocity dispersion , mass , radius , and x - ray temperature and luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the scaling relations of these quantities with richness are entirely consistent with those derived by assuming a simple mass density profile at 0.5 @xmath2 mpc of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the excellent correlations between @xmath0  and velocity dispersion and x - ray temperature allow one to use richness , an easily measurable quantity using relatively shallow optical imaging data alone , as a predictor of these quantities at moderate redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0  parameter can be used to estimate the velocity dispersion of a cluster to a precision of approximately 15% ( @xmath4 km s@xmath5 ) , and x - ray temperature to about 20% . </S>",
    "<S> similar correlations , but with larger scatter , are also obtained between richness and the characteristic radius and mass of the clusters . we compare the relative merits of @xmath0 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7  as predictors of the dynamical mass , and find that they are comparable , providing estimates at an accuracy of @xmath8% . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform similar analyses of correlations between richness and velocity dispersion , @xmath6 , and @xmath7  with a sample of low - redshift abell clusters and find consistent results , but with larger scatter , which may be the result of a less homogeneous database , or sample - dependent effects . </S>"
