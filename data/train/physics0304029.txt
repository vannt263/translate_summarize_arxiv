    "in many situations there is a need to represent a given quantum state or a probability distribution of states in terms of a simple basis which can be easily handled in further processing , e.g. , for integration in matrix elements .",
    "gaussians form such a basis although it is overcomplete .",
    "gaussians have the additional advantage that they can adopt the form of coherent states in phase space , thereby supplying a direct link to classical mechanics .",
    "hence , the formulation in terms of gaussians is also very useful for a mixed quantum - classical or quasiclassical description of a system . in particular the evolution of systems with many degrees of freedom",
    "can often be described within classical molecular dynamics only . here",
    ", one is interested in obtaining optimal initial conditions by translating the initial quantum state of the system into a suitable classical phase space distribution which can be classically propagated @xcite .",
    "while all quantum information on an amplitude level is lost in this approximation , we will introduce a representation which can preserve basic quantum interferences by construction even in the case of the purely classical propagation .",
    "finally , it is of general and basic interest to reconstruct amplitudes or the density matrix , i.e. , coherent information , from phase space distributions .",
    "this has been done recently in terms of the moments in time of the wigner distribution @xcite .",
    "although there is no principal need to do so we will concentrate on the wigner distribution due to the attention it has received recently in different areas . in several experiments",
    "the wigner distribution of microscopic systems has been measured @xcite . beyond the quantum context , in the time - frequency phase space of signal processing , analysis of the wigner distribution @xcite",
    "is an important tool @xcite , as for optics @xcite , speech analysis @xcite or the monitoring of machinery conditions @xcite .",
    "the decomposition of a given state @xmath1 into coherent states can be regarded as a particular form of phase space representation .",
    "labeling positions by @xmath2 or @xmath3 and momenta by @xmath4 or @xmath5 , we translate the ground state of the harmonic oscillator by @xmath6 to obtain the coherent state in position representation , i.e. its wavefunction is  @xcite @xmath7 for simplicity , we chose unit frequency ( @xmath8 ) and mass ( @xmath9 ) for the harmonic oscillator without loss of generality .",
    "( often the complex variable @xmath10 is used and the constant phase @xmath11 is omitted ) . even though the coherent state basis is overcomplete , the exact representation , @xmath12 so that @xmath13 to shorten the notation .",
    "( with the second equation we also define the symplectic matrix @xmath14 ) .",
    "it follows that one can approximate any given state by a finite expansion @xmath15 by minimizing the error , defined in some convenient way .",
    "of course , it is much better to use some features of @xmath1 as a preliminary guide to where the @xmath16 should be located .",
    "an obvious necessary condition for a good fit is that the coherent state intensity @xmath17 in @xmath18 be well approximated by @xmath19 for each phase space point @xmath20 .",
    "but note that , if the diagonal terms in this expression are only appreciable for @xmath21 very close to @xmath20 , a nondiagonal term decays as a product of gaussians centered on a pair of separate phase space vectors .",
    "such a term is negligible for all @xmath20 unless @xmath21 is very close to @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , such nondiagonal terms are not positive definite , which justifies our performing the preliminary fit @xmath23 where @xmath24 the factor @xmath25 has here been introduced so that the left hand side becomes the husimi function @xcite , i.e. , the husimi representation of the state @xmath1 , also known as the @xmath3-function in quantum optics @xcite . here , @xmath26 is then decomposed into gaussians phase space packets ( gpps ) which are husimi representations of the coherent states , specified by @xmath18 .",
    "the husimi function in its own right uniquely defines a quantum state , though part of the quantum phase information is locked up into its delicate analytic properties .",
    "these are hard to translate into other representations , but we propose to sidestep this problem .",
    "our method is to make a preliminary fit of the husimi function @xmath27 , which is real and positive definite , and therefore much simpler than fitting the complex coherent states directly in @xmath28 .",
    "however we can now identify the coefficients of the husimi fitting as being proportional to the square modulus of the coefficients of the superposition of coherent states @xmath28 .",
    "the phases of the coefficients are then determined by relating the husimi function to the coarse - graining of the wigner function , i.e. we bring in yet a third phase space representation of the state @xmath1 .",
    "it should be pointed out that , once the state @xmath1 has been fitted by a finite number of coherent states , it can be viewed in any representation . the special attention given here to the wigner function",
    "is justified by the way that it highlights quantum interferences .",
    "in fact such interferences are sometimes mimicked by extra gaussians in the context of numerical work with classical densities  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the next section we present the wigner function , its relation to the husimi function and its specific form for an arbitrary superposition of gaussians .",
    "in addition , we discuss and establish the differences between the representation of quantum states such as the wavefunction , the wigner distribution and the husimi distribution using these gaussians .",
    "the wigner distribution sets the stage for the delicate procedure of fitting the phases , i.e. , to determine the appropriate interference fringes between the gaussians as detailed in section 3 .",
    "in this section we propose a method for determining the phase of the expansion coefficients by fourier analysing the wigner function .",
    "actually , this resulting _ chord function _ or _",
    "characteristic function _ ( in quantum optics  @xcite ) can be derived directly from the initial wave function , without obtaining first the wigner function .",
    "the husimi function , on the other hand , supplies a robust overall picture of the quantum states which can be used to place the gaussians .",
    "this will be discussed in section 4 using explicit examples for illustration .",
    "emphasis will be put on general symmetry criteria for placing the gaussians and numerical demonstrations based on monte carlo fitting of sampled wavefunctions . finally in section 5 ,",
    "we semiclassically interpret the results of section 4 , namely the increase of gaussians needed to represent quantum states @xmath29 of a system with increasing quantum number @xmath0 .",
    "a summary in section 6 concludes the paper .    for simplicity ,",
    "all our formulae are presented for systems with a single degree of freedom , but they are easily generalized to high dimensional systems .",
    "the state @xmath1 is uniquely described by the real function of phase space points @xmath30 , @xmath31 known as the wigner function @xcite .",
    "inversion of this symmetrized fourier transform leads back to the wavefunction , while its intensity results from the projection @xmath32 , its projection is always positive .",
    "actually , this is just a particular case of the general relation , @xmath33 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , introducing the wigner function for the coherent state @xmath34 , @xmath35 we obtain the husimi representation of @xmath1 as @xmath36 this shows that the positive definite husimi function results from the gaussian smoothing of the wigner function . inserting the coherent state expansion @xmath1 given by @xmath28 into the wigner",
    "transform ( [ e21 ] ) , we obtain the well known form of the corresponding wigner function , @xmath37 where we define the crossed wigner function ( or moyal bracket @xcite ) @xmath38 here we use the abbreviated relations @xmath39 and @xmath40 , as well as the skew product @xmath41 . comparing @xmath42 with @xmath43 we find the same gaussian form for the diagonal terms of the wigner function as for the husimi function , but the offdiagonal terms are no longer negligible .",
    "for the wigner function , any pair of coherent states determines a third gaussian centered halfway between their two centres , of comparable amplitude to the diagonal contributions of the individual gaussians .",
    "this interference term is only cancelled by the smoothing employed to obtain the husimi function , because of the phase oscillations .",
    "their wavelengths in phase space are @xmath44 , so that the husimi function is increasingly damped with growing separation of these gpps .",
    "this is an excellent illustration of the way that the husimi function highlights the classical structure in a quantum state , while it hides quantum phase information .",
    "this question will be further developed in section 4 .",
    "of course the phase information is still contained in the small offdiagonal terms in @xmath43 , because the husimi function is fully quantum mechanical , but this information is certainly more accessible in the wigner representation .",
    "we can now understand the differences between using the position representation , i.e. the wave function , the wigner representation or the husimi representation , to fit a given state by a set of coherent states .",
    "the position representation has the advantage that there are no interference terms between pairs of coherent states .",
    "however , if the state is highly oscillatory , such as a highly excited eigenstate of a hamiltonian , this needs to be fitted by coherent states with large momenta @xmath5 , which also have narrow oscillations .",
    "clearly the fitting procedure becomes very unstable with respect to small errors in the initial function if large momenta are necessary .",
    "in contrast , the diagonal terms in the expansion of the wigner function are smooth gaussians distributed over phase space , but again we obtain increasingly narrow oscillations for the interferences around the midpoint of each pair . of course",
    ", the oscillations of the wave function and the wigner function are not unrelated , since the latter have the same wavelength as the wave intensity in the case of a pair of gaussians located at ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "finally , the husimi function washes out oscillations , the more effectively the tighter they happen to be .",
    "we shall review in section 4 how the smooth phase space distribution singles out the basic classical structure within the quantum state , which can be stably fitted by real gpps .",
    "the cost is that only the location of the gaussians in phase space and the square modulus of their coefficients are then determined . in the next section we present a method for retrieving the phases of the coefficients by taking the fourier transform of the wigner function",
    "both , the direction and the wavelength of the fringes that modulate the interference peak halfway between two gpps at @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the wigner representation , are entirely determined by @xmath46 .",
    "however , these fringes are translated by changing the phases of the coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which we wish to determine .",
    "clearly , the best way to recover these phases is to take the fourier transform of the wigner function : @xmath49 it is also possible to express this directly from the wave function @xmath50 which resembles the wigner transform @xmath51 .",
    "this function is known as the woodward ambiguity function in communications theory @xcite or the characteristic function in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "usually the sign of @xmath52 is reversed in the definition of @xmath53 , but here we follow @xcite , where it is simply called the chord function .",
    "a justification for this term appears immediately if we consider the case of a superposition of gaussians that is our concern : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 thus all the diagonal terms collapse onto gaussians centered on @xmath57 , whereas each interference term is a gaussian centered on the chord joining @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "( both directions @xmath58 are present , leading to symmetric contributions in chord space . indeed , we must have @xmath59 ) .",
    "let us now suppose that a given chord @xmath46 is sufficiently far from all the other chords , so that at @xmath60 the chord function is dominated by the single nondiagonal contribution @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath62 then , defining @xmath63 and recalling that we have already fitted @xmath64 from the husimi function , we obtain @xmath65 from @xmath66 of course , the modulus of both sides of @xmath67 should be approximately equal , which provides a check on the previous husimi fitting .",
    "the diagonal sum that is substracted from @xmath68 in @xmath67 decays exponentially with @xmath69 , so it will only affect the phases of the smaller chords .",
    "it might appear to be only consistent with our previous approximation of the husimi function to neglect the diagonal sum in ( [ e36 ] ) , but this would perturb the phases of small chords .",
    "so far , nothing has been said about how to place the gaussians in phase space that are meant to approximate a given husimi function .",
    "an obvious criterion is that any relative maximum of this smooth distribution should also receive a coherent state .",
    "further knowledge of the state should also be used .",
    "for instance , if it is known to be the eigenstate of a given hamiltonian @xmath70 with energy @xmath71 , then the semiclassical considerations in the following section allow the restriction of the gaussian centers to @xmath72 .",
    "of course , the fitting procedure is only useful for cases in which @xmath70 is unknown , or else @xmath1 may itself be a linear superposition of states , such as result from a two slit experiment . here",
    "we immediately feel the advantage that the decomposition @xmath28 is defined in terms of the state itself , rather than the density operator @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the linearity of @xmath74 allows us to fit @xmath75 and @xmath76 independently and then to superpose the fitted state as @xmath77 . a further simplication results from possible symmetries .",
    "for instance , for the eigenstate of an even potential , one should place the gaussians symmetrically at @xmath78 with @xmath79 , so as to guarantee even or odd states .",
    "again , this is a very particular case , but time reversal invariance is much more common .",
    "if the state @xmath1 resulted from initial real wave functions and the evolution proceeded through interactions that preserve time reversal symmetries ( in usual practice , if there are no magnetic fields ) then the final state can also be real . in this case",
    ", one must choose symmetric pairs of gaussians at @xmath80 with equal real coefficients , @xmath81 , so as to ensure that @xmath1 is also real .",
    "this halves the number of independent coherent states to be fitted and reduces the choice of phase to either zero , or @xmath82 .",
    "any further knowledge should generally be used to reduce the randomness of the positions of the coherent states to be fitted to @xmath1 .",
    "the semiclassical considerations in the following section may be a further guideline .",
    "when this knowledge is exhausted , the best course is to optimize random guesses by monte carlo fitting of arbitrary gaussians , within the given constraints .",
    "specifically , in order to measure the quality of the fitting , we define the relative error @xmath83 as the mean square deviation between the known husimi function @xmath84 of a quantum state @xmath85 and its fitting to the superposition of gpps defined in ( [ e19 ] ) .",
    "this error @xmath86 has to be minimized for a set of @xmath87 grid points @xmath88 . to fit this superposition of gpps as closely as possible to @xmath84 ,",
    "we proceed as follows : ( i ) the centers @xmath89 of the coherent states are obtained by monte - carlo sampling the region where the distribution is significant ; that is the region where the distribution exceeds a certain threshold @xmath90 ; ( ii ) the centers must not be too close , this means a minimum distance @xmath91 between centers is fixed a priori , thereby avoiding overlaps and reducing the total number @xmath92 of gpps used for the representation ; ( iii ) starting with @xmath93 we increase n by one and repeat the process until the desired accuracy is reached . since only the coefficients @xmath94 are fitted , minimizing the error @xmath95 reduces to a problem of linear optimization which is equivalent to solving the real matrix equation @xmath96 where the phase space points @xmath97 that define the matrix elements @xmath98 are randomly selected . here",
    ", @xmath99 contains the coefficients to be determined and @xmath100 those of the known husimi function . in general",
    ", the matrix @xmath101 is expected to be sparse and a variety of special algorithms can be used to solve ( [ e42 ] ) efficiently  @xcite . in principle one",
    "may also consider to optimize this fitting with respect to the widths of the gpps ; but since the husimi function is always smooth and positive definite , it is convenient to keep them frozen . in",
    "what follows , we have tested our method on the fitting of the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) and that of the morse oscillator ( mo ) supporting 18 bound states  @xcite .",
    "we have not used the knowledge that these states have time reversal symmetry in the way mentioned earlier , so we should obtain results of comparable quality even for states with complex wave functions .",
    "figure 1 shows , on the top , the known husimi function for the 3rd excited state of ho ( left ) and for the 5th excited state of mo ( right ) , with parameters @xmath102 . on the bottom",
    "the corresponding fitted distributions are shown .",
    "we found that @xmath103 is sufficient to reproduce quite well the husimi function of ho whereas 14 coherent states ( gpps ) are needed in the mo example , to achieve a global relative error of @xmath104 .",
    "the respective values for the threshold @xmath90 and the minimum distance @xmath91 are given in the caption of figure 1 .",
    "this preliminary fit on the husimi function provides us with the total number @xmath92 of gpps , their location in phase space @xmath105 and the expansion coefficients @xmath94 .",
    "these coefficients are related to those of the coherent states @xmath48 and their phases @xmath106 by @xmath107    up to this point , the phases @xmath106 are still unknown .",
    "we only need to determine the phases differences @xmath108 in ( [ e26 ] ) which can be easily extracted from ( [ e38 ] ) .",
    "this says that , for @xmath92 gpps , @xmath109 chords ( @xmath108 ) are required to reproduce the wigner function .",
    "these @xmath109 pairs of gaussians ( chords ) are symmetrically spaced about @xmath57 , so that , being more dense , they overlap more than the original set of @xmath92 gaussians in phase space .",
    "figure 2 shows on the top the wigner function of the 3rd excited state of the ho together with its corresponding fit obtained with @xmath110 gpps .",
    "the present fitting reproduces the wigner function everywhere in phase space , even for negative regions which are signatures of quantum interference .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in figure 3 where the deviations of the monte carlo sampled wigner function , less than @xmath111 everywhere in phase space , are depicted for both , the ho ( left , @xmath112 ) and the mo ( right , @xmath113 ) . the global relative error @xmath95 is subsequently found not to exceed @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , we have computed the number @xmath92 of gpps needed to represent the wigner functions of the eigenstates of our test systems , as can be seen in figure 4 .",
    "one sees that @xmath92 grows proportionally to @xmath115 as the vibrational quantum number @xmath0 increases . in the following section",
    ", we provide a semiclassical justification of this result by means of the wkb quantization .",
    "a semiclassical state @xmath116 is supported by a curve in phase space , in the case of one degree of freedom , or in general by a surface with half the phase space dimension @xcite .",
    "if the curve or surface is closed , it must be bohr - quantized and it will be symmetric about @xmath117 in the case of time reversal symmetry . in the case of the position representation , for each branch of the curve ( surface ) , @xmath118 , one defines the action @xmath119 leading to the generalized wkb wavefunction , @xmath120 the amplitudes @xmath121 can also be expressed in terms of the actions , but the important point is that they are purely classical so that the only @xmath122-dependence occurs in the exponential .",
    "thus locally , for any small range of positions , the semiclassical wave function reduces to a superposition of plane waves characterized by the wave - vectors @xmath123 . the semiclassical wigner function is also defined in terms of an action @xmath124 with respect to the classical curve ( surface ) . but instead of the area between the curve and the @xmath2-axis , we are now concerned with the area sandwiched between the curve and one of its chords .",
    "the latter , @xmath125 , is selected by the property that it is centred on the point @xmath126 , as shown in figure 5 .",
    "thus , for one degree of freedom @xcite , @xmath127 with straightforward generalizations @xcite .",
    "the important point is that @xcite @xmath128 where we use the symplectic matrix @xmath129 defined in ( [ e15 ] ) .",
    "thus the semiclassical state is again represented by a superposition of waves , @xmath130    but now these are _ phase space waves_. comparison of this expression with ( [ e36 ] ) immediately reveals that these waves have exactly the same wave vector as a pair of gaussians at the tip of each chord @xmath125 .",
    "it follows that an important feature of a semiclassical state is automatically reproduced by fitting it with gaussians precisely placed on the corresponding classical curve ( surface ) .",
    "notice that , in fact , this is a major a priori obstacle to performing the fitting , because the oscillations near the midpoint of a long chord are very fine for @xmath131 .",
    "one would need very narrow gaussians indeed to fit these phase space waves directly , rather than having them arise naturally as interferences .",
    "all that is left to determine the phase : @xmath132 .",
    "how can we single out the region in which to place the gpps , if we have no a priori knowledge of the classical structures correponding to a quantum state ?",
    "the obvious course is to smooth the wigner function with a gaussian window . in other words",
    ", we initially fit the husimi function . recalling that the gpps have linear width of order @xmath133 , while the wavelength of the wigner oscillations are @xmath134",
    ", it follows that this gaussian window erases effectively a semiclassical wigner function , except in the limit of very small chords .",
    "this is a simple explanation of the well known fact that only in the neighbourhood of the classical curve ( surface ) itself is the semiclassical husimi function appreciable . in the simple case of one degree of freedom , the husimi function is concentrated near the energy shell .",
    "thus , by fitting gpps to a husimi function , one automatically samples its relevant classical mainifold , if it happens to have a ( possibly unknown ) semiclassical structure .",
    "a basic assumption in the above argument is that the gpps along the curve ( surface ) are neither too crowded , to avoid confusing superpositions , nor too sparsely spaced , lest gaps should arise in the fitting .",
    "it is thus easy to estimate the growth of the number of coherent states required to fit the eigenstate @xmath135 with the degree of excitation . since the linear width of the gaussian scales as @xmath136 , the phase space area of the curve grows as @xmath137 and hence its length grows as @xmath138 , the number of equispaced gaussians needed to cover the curve grows as @xmath139",
    "of course , we have assumed here that the shape of the curve does not change with @xmath0 , as for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "if the eigencurve elongates for higher excitation , the number of gpps necessary for a good fit will grow as @xmath140 , with @xmath141 . we can also estimate the growth in time of the number of gpps required to fit an evolving semiclassical state with arbitrary precision . according to the theory of van vleck @xcite ,",
    "it is sufficient to evolve the curve ( surface ) classically and then to reconstruct the wave function .",
    "this principle can also be applied to wigner functions , according to berry and balazs  @xcite .",
    "if the driving hamiltonian is chaotic , then the curve will stretch at a rate depending on the lyapunov exponent , @xmath142 .",
    "clearly , this also determines the initial rate of growth of the number of gpps needed for an adequate fit .",
    "ultimately , when the curve covers densely all the available phase space ( the energy shell of the driving hamiltonian ) , a steady state will be reached where the number of gpps saturates .",
    "optimal fitting of quantum states by phase space gaussians is achieved by first fitting the husimi function and then determining the quantum phases from the chord function , i.e. the fourier transform of the wigner function .",
    "it is clear from the discussion in the introduction that the density of gaussians in phase space must be finely adjusted : if ther are too few , essential features of the state will be missed , whereas an excessive number of gaussians would introduce interference terms in the husimi function itself , which could only be accomodated by a much more complex variation of this method .",
    "the numerical examples in section 4 indicate clearly that , as well as achieving excellent overall accuracy , all essential qualitative features of the states are captured by this method , using a basis of gaussians that grows more slowly than the excitation number of the fitted states .",
    "this last result and further insight into the fitting procedure , follows from the semiclassical analysis in the previous section .",
    "this can be generalized readily to states of quantum systems with higher degrees of freedom if these are eigenstates of integrable systems ( i. e. if they are supported by a lagrangean surface in phase space ; see e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "of course , more gaussians will then be needed for the fitting , but the preliminary fit of the husimi function should still provide optimal results .",
    "the potential for this method to deal with the eigenstates of chaotic systems is even more interesting . though the _ chord _ and _ centre _ description of the wigner function still applies to mixtures of eigenstates over narrow energy windows , no classical theory accounts for individual eigenstates at present .",
    "therefore , it will be extremely useful to describe these as interfering superpositions of gaussians placed near the energy shell .",
    "of course , the size of this basis would diverge at the classical limit as @xmath143 , but manageable approximations should be attainable for finite excitations .",
