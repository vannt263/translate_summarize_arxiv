    "cooling and heating processes play an important role in studying the accretion disks around compact objects . in this paper , we consider both viscous heating and bremsstrahlung cooling as energy dissipative processes . in chakrabarti and das@xmath0 ,",
    "the problem of accretion and winds with small angular momentum was solved in a very comprehensive way when viscous heating is included .",
    "the entire parameter space was scanned and separated in terms of flows with and without shocks . a major scope for further work",
    "is to find and separate the parameter space which allows shock formations when cooling effects are also included .",
    "this will allow us to study flows with high accretion rate as well .",
    "the question arises because viscosity transports angular momentum and increases the possibility of shock formation at a larger distance from the black hole .",
    "however , cooling reduces the post - shock pressure and therefore the possibility of shock formation .",
    "various cooling processes will and should change the parameter space in which shocks form .    in chakrabarti@xmath1 , some of the effects of cooling was included . assuming that cooling at a given radius of an accretion disk is proportional to the heating , all possible topologies were presented . while cooling will and should depend on heating",
    ", there is no reason to believe that this proportionality is independent of radial distance .",
    "it is therefore necessary to re - visit the problem with explicit form of heating and cooling included .    in the present paper",
    ", we make these important extensions of the previous work and show that shocks are still possible in a very large part of the parameter space .",
    "we find topologies of solutions which are similar to what was found for spiral shock study@xmath2 , but otherwise new for axisymmetric situation .",
    "we also find new topologies which were not anticipated before .",
    "in more recent years , it has become evident that the standing shocks may be very important in explaining the spectral properties of black hole candidates@xmath3 as the post - shock region behaves as the boundary layer where accreting matter dissipates its thermal energy and generates hard x - ray by inverse comptonization .",
    "this region is also found to be responsible to produce relativistic outflows .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations indicated that the shocks may be oscillating at nearby regions of the parameter space in presence of cooling effects@xmath4 and the shock oscillations can also explain intricate properties of quasi - periodic oscillations@xmath5 .",
    "recent observations do support the presence of sub - keplerian flows in accretion disks@xmath6 .",
    "the present work is done around a schwarzschild black hole by using pseudo - newtonian potential@xmath7 .",
    "we use a similar viscosity prescription as in chakrabarti@xmath1 . in  2 , we present model equations which included both heating and cooling effects . in  3 , we perform the sonic point analysis . in  5",
    ", we study the nature of the sonic points and how they vary with flow parameters . in  6 , we study the global solution topologies with heating and cooling effects . in  7",
    ", we classify the parameter space in terms of whether shocks will form or not and how it depends on flow parameters . in  8 ,",
    "we briefly report how even the super - keplerian flows may also be transonic .",
    "finally , in  9 , we discuss the importance of these solutions and make concluding remarks .",
    "as far as the cooling processes are concerned , they could be due to various physical reasons , such as the thermal and the non - thermal bremsstrahlung , synchrotron , comptonization etc . for simplicity , we assume that the comptonization enhances the injected photon intensity due to bremsstrahlung by a factor of @xmath8 which can take any value from @xmath9 to @xmath10 few @xmath11 depending on the availability of soft photons@xmath3 .",
    "in other words , we use @xmath8 as a parameter to represent the net cooling .",
    "we start with a thin , axisymmetric , rotating viscous accretion flow around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the space - time geometry around a non - rotating black hole can be satisfactorily described by the pseudo - newtonian potential@xmath7 and is given by @xmath12 , where , @xmath13 is the radial distance in dimensionless unit . in the steady state ,",
    "the dimensionless hydrodynamic equations that govern the infalling matter are the followings@xmath1 .",

    "the distances , velocities and masses are made dimensionless by using @xmath20 , the schwarzschild radius , @xmath21 , the velocity of light and @xmath22 , the mass of the black hole , respectively . here",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the vertically integrated density and viscous stress , @xmath25 is the entropy density of the flow , @xmath26 is the local temperature , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the heat gained and lost by the flow , and @xmath29 is the mass accretion rate .",
    "we assume that the accretion flow is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction and the vertical velocity component is much smaller compared to the radial component . with this assumption ,",
    "the local disk height is obtained by equating the pressure gradient force in the vertical direction with the gravitational force .",
    "the half thickness of the disk is then given by , @xmath30 where , the sound speed is defined as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 being the adiabatic index , pressure and density respectively .    in the present paper , we follow a similar viscosity prescription as given in chakrabarti@xmath1 where @xmath35 is used .",
    "this prescription ensures that viscous stress remain continuous at the flow discontinuity ( shock ) in presence of significant radial motion of the accretion flow .",
    "a black hole accretes matter either from its binary companion or from the surrounding ambient medium .",
    "this matter starts with a negligible radial velocity at the outer edge of the disk .",
    "but it enters into the black hole with a velocity of light@xmath36 .",
    "this ensures that inside the accretion disk there must be at least one point where the radial velocity exactly matches with the sound speed .",

    "<S> low angular momentum accretion flows can have standing and oscillating shock waves . </S>",
    "<S> we study the region of the parameter space in which multiple sonic points occur in viscous flows in presence of various cooling effects such as bremsstrahlung and comptonization . </S>",
    "<S> we also quantify the parameter space in which shocks are steady or oscillating . </S>",
    "<S> we find that cooling induces effects opposite to heating by viscosity even in modifying the topology of the solutions , though one can never be exactly balanced by the other due to their dissimilar dependence on dynamic and thermodynamic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we show that beyond a critical value of cooling , the flow ceases to contain a shock wave .    </S>",
