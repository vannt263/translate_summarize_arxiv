    "in the field of ultra - cold atomic physics the two commonly used techniques to image a cloud of atoms are absorption imaging and fluorescence imaging , _",
    "i.e.  _ imaging the cloud s absorbed or radiated intensity , respectively . in absorption imaging the shadow cast in a probe beam by the cloud of atoms is recorded on a ccd camera . from the resulting image the spatial extent of the cloud and the optical density , proportional to the column density along the line - of - sight of the probe beam , can be derived . for dense clouds",
    "absorption imaging becomes unreliable , since for optical densities of the order of @xmath0 the dynamic range of the absorption imagining technique is insufficient to accurately determine the intensity in the shadowed region @xcite . for bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) the typical _ in situ_optical density is of the order of @xmath1 and the image gets completely `` blacked out '' , making it impossible to extract the column density from the image .",
    "the fluorescence imaging technique critically depends on the intensity and the frequency of the probe beam .",
    "furthermore , for high densities the cloud becomes opaque and atoms in the center of the cloud are not subjected to the same intensity as atoms on the edge of the cloud .",
    "one way to reduce the optical density is to reduce the atom - photon cross section by choosing a large probe beam detuning .",
    "however , for nonzero detuning the real part of the index of refraction of the atoms becomes nonzero and the cloud behaves like a gradient - index lens .",
    "this results in a refraction of the probe beam and leads to distortion of the images .",
    "the resulting images can not be used for a relative or absolute column density measurement , since the magnitude of this effect has a spatial dependence . detuning the probe",
    "beam further from resonance reduces the index of refraction but leaves the cloud virtually transparent before the refraction is sufficiently reduced .",
    "the optical density can successfully be decreased by reducing the atomic density .",
    "the cloud is allowed to expand during a specific time - of - flight ( tof ) and an image is recorded as soon as the optical density is of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "although absorption imaging after expansion is the commonly used technique in this field , expansion of the cloud introduces some difficulties as well .",
    "first , if the cloud is a bec at finite temperature there is no accurate description available of the expansion of the cloud .",
    "second , the quantization axis of the cloud is no longer well - defined since the magnetic fields are turned off . as a result",
    ", the effective cross section for the polarized probe beam becomes ambiguous . as a consequence both absorption imaging and fluorescence imaging can not be applied to accurately determine the column density of dense clouds .",
    "some techniques have been developed to image dense clouds by using strong saturation in both absorption @xcite and fluorescence @xcite imaging .",
    "however , the high - intensity regime has to be calibrated based on the low - intensity regime and the latter regime is imaged after expansion . as a consequence",
    "the issues raised above about imaging after expansion apply to the strong saturation techniques as well , although cloud can be imaged _ in situ_.    alternatively , phase contrast imaging ( pci ) has been successfully applied to image dense atomic clouds @xcite . in pci the real part of the index of refraction is measured .",
    "the detuning can be chosen in such a way that the refraction is small but the phase shift due to the index of refraction remains substantial .",
    "pci can be used to image becs in a nondestructive way , since the number of scattered photons becomes negligible for large detuning .",
    "other techniques based on dispersive light scattering , such as diffraction - contrast imaging of cold atoms @xcite and nondestructive spatial heterodyne imaging of cold atoms @xcite have been demonstrated on dense thermal clouds .    here",
    ", we use pci to measure the _ in situ_density distribution of dense becs at finite temperature absolutely and accurately . by choosing a smaller detuning compared to the nondestructive pci schemes ,",
    "the density of the thermal cloud and the bec are determined accurately for all typical temperatures .",
    "this allows us to directly study the interplay between the condensed and thermal atoms and the influence of this interaction on the transition temperature for condensation .",
    "this paper begins with a detailed description of the pci technique and the way it is applied to a cold bose gas .",
    "next , the accuracy is demonstrated in two experiments . in the first experiment ,",
    "described in ",
    "[ subsection : problemsabsim ] , the number of condensed atoms is measured with an accuracy below @xmath3% in a single shot .",
    "in the second experiment , described in   [ subsection : interactions ] the growth of the condensate is studied as a function of the temperature . in this measurement ,",
    "the interaction between the condensed and thermal atoms is studied directly .",
    "furthermore , measurements around the temperature where a bec is formed are used to determine the transition temperature .",
    "it is possible to image a cloud of atoms by illuminating the cloud with a probe beam and record the shadow cast due to the absorption of the atoms on a ccd camera . since the optical density is measured , this technique probes the imaginary part of the complex index of refraction @xmath4 of the atomic cloud .",
    "in contrast , the imaging technique described in this paper probes the real part of @xmath4 .",
    "this technique is used in the phase contrast microscope which is developed by zernike in 1933 . in 1953",
    "zernike was awarded the nobel prize `` for his demonstration of the phase contrast method , especially for his invention of the phase contrast microscope '' @xcite .    in general , the complex phase @xmath5 accumulated by the light in a medium such as a cloud of atoms",
    "can be expressed as @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the optical density .",
    "writing the electric field of the probe beam as @xmath8 with @xmath9 the amplitude of the light field , the electric field after passing a cloud of atoms can be written as @xmath10 where the electric field is split in two parts : the part that is diffracted by the atoms , @xmath11 , and the part that is not , @xmath12 . in absorption imaging the phase information is lost on a ccd camera , since the intensity @xmath13 is measured as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the speed of light and @xmath17 is the vacuum permittivity .",
    "so the real phase term @xmath18 cancels and only the absorption is measured . in the simplest form of pci , the non - diffracted part of the probe light ( first term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phase ] ) ) is blocked .",
    "the light that arrives at the camera is the light which is diffracted by the atoms , @xmath19 . now",
    "the phase information no longer cancels and the intensity on the camera is given by @xmath20 where the arbitrary phase of the probe beam cancels .",
    "this technique is referred to as dark - field imaging and has been successfully used to image @xmath21 atoms in the early days of experimental bec physics @xcite .",
    "an important experimental drawback of this method is the absence of probe light on the camera preventing the normalization of the intensity profile , which makes this technique not suitable to measure the absolute phase shift .",
    "however , the relative signal can be used to study the spatial distribution .",
    "a more elaborate way of converting the accumulated phase into an intensity profile is by phase shifting the non - diffracted light instead of blocking it , in the same way as the phase contrast microscope works .",
    "the non - diffracted light is the plane wave part of the beam , which can be phase - shifted by placing a small transparent object with a refractive index in the probe beam in such a way that only the plane wave part of the beam propagates through it .",
    "this object will be called a phase spot .",
    "the plane wave part propagating through the phase spot accumulates a phase @xmath22 , changing eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phase ] ) to @xmath23 now , the intensity is given by @xmath24 where the arbitrary phase of the probe beam cancels .",
    "the probe beam is not blocked and it is possible to derive the absolute phase shift , since the intensity profile @xmath25 can be measured and used for normalization .",
    "this technique has also been successfully applied to image @xmath21 atoms @xcite . the implementation of pci described in ref .",
    "@xcite uses a detuning of the probe beam , which is large compared to the atomic resonance and the absorption of the light by the atoms is therefore reduced to a degree that it is no longer destructive .",
    "this allows for taking multiple images of the same bec .    in our experiment we do not focus on the ability to make a nondestructive image",
    "but we use the periodicity of the intensity as a function of @xmath26 ( seeeq .",
    "( [ eqn : phase_phasespot_full ] ) ) to accurately determine the accumulated phase of both the bec and the thermal cloud . in recent years , different schemes are proposed derive the phase information of a cloud of cold atoms @xcite , but the accumulated phase has never been used for accurate quantitative measurements of the density distribution of becs at finite temperature .",
    "we continue with a detailed description of the phase shift of an electro - magnetic wave propagating through a cloud of spin - polarized atoms in order to relate @xmath26 to the atomic density .",
    "the phase shift is caused by the modification of the probe field by the atomic dipoles , so we start with an expression of the polarizability of one atom .",
    "the polarizability tensor @xmath27 in the low - intensity limit and @xmath28 is given by @xcite    @xmath29    where the natural linewidth @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 here , @xmath32 are the electric - dipole operators , @xmath33 is the density matrix , @xmath34 is the detuning and @xmath35 is the probe frequency . in the experiment",
    "various linear polarizations of the light field have to be dealt with , so the dependence of the polarizability @xmath27 on the polarization has to be determined .",
    "we define the angle @xmath36 as the angle between the @xmath37-axis of the atomic cloud and the ( linear ) polarization direction of the light field which is in the @xmath38 plane . in this system ,",
    "the line - of - sight is along the @xmath39-axis . in order to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nienhuis ] ) for different polarizations , a fixed polarization axis is chosen parallel to the polarization of the light field and eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nienhuis ] ) is evaluated in this frame , in which conveniently only @xmath40 transitions are induced .",
    "furthermore , only one component of the polarizability tensor will contribute in this frame and the polarizability becomes a scalar .",
    "since all atoms in the trap are in the @xmath41 state with respect to the @xmath37-axis of the magnetic field confining the atoms , the density matrix @xmath42 only has one nonzero element , which makes the calculation of the rotation from the magnetic @xmath37-axis to the polarization axis of the light field straight - forward .",
    "rotating the density matrix of the ground state @xmath42 is achieved using @xmath43 where the rotation matrix @xmath44 for rotating a system around the @xmath39-axis over an angle @xmath36 for a system with @xmath45 can be found using wigner s formula as @xcite @xmath46    since the two dipole moment operators @xmath47 do not change the @xmath48-state of the atoms , only the diagonal elements of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nienhuis ] ) play a role and we end up with @xmath49 furthermore , we can define the square of the clebsch - gordan coefficients @xmath50 ( transition strength ) as @xmath51 and obtain using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : def - gamma ] ) @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the detuning with respect to transition @xmath54 and @xmath55 the cross section for absorption of light : @xmath56    for sodium atoms in the @xmath41 state this results in @xmath57 where    @xmath58    for alkali metal atoms the polarizability is independent of the angle @xmath36 if the detuning @xmath34 is large compared to the hyperfine splitting of the excited state . in that limit the numerator of the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : polphi ] ) is @xmath59 with no angular dependence.finally , the complex index of refraction @xmath4 is given by @xmath60 with @xmath61 the density .",
    "note that for atoms confined in a potential the density is not homogeneous and @xmath61 depends on the position , @xmath62 .    the index of refraction given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : complexior ] ) is only valid for low densities . for higher densities , the dipole moment of an atoms",
    "is influenced by the internal field of the surrounding atoms .",
    "this results in a modification of the refractive index , which is accounted for by the lorentz - lorenz equation @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is given by @xmath65    since the atoms being imaged are bosons instead of classical particles , the index of refraction will be modified further due to bunching of the atoms .",
    "two terms are added to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : collective_class ] ) .",
    "the first term accounts for modifications due to the enhanced photon scattering cross section caused by the quantum statistics of the atoms .",
    "the second term describes the modified refractive index induced by resonant van der waals interaction , resulting in an increase of almost @xmath66 in both the real part and the imaginary part of the refractive index @xcite .",
    "we have derived the modifications along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite and have confirmed the result for the detuning and densities reported in that paper .",
    "we found modifications to the complex index of refraction strongly depend on the chosen detuning and therefore on @xmath67 . in ref",
    "@xcite , @xmath68 , while we are in the regime @xmath69 . for our parameters ,",
    "the real part of the index of refraction does not change significantly .",
    "however , we do find an enhancement of the absorption by a factor of @xmath70 .",
    "since the overall absorption is very small , up to four percent at the detuning used , enhanced absorption does not influences the intensity profile significantly . as a result",
    ", we expect the measured phase to change less than one percent due to this effect .      the image of a cloud of atoms recorded on a ccd camera yields the column density of the cloud , that is the density profile integrated along the probe line - of - sight .",
    "the column density can be linked to the complex index of refraction in the following way . in general ,",
    "light passing through a medium with an index of refraction @xmath4 over a distance @xmath71 accumulates a complex phase @xmath5 given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "since the index of refraction depends on the position , the accumulated phase is written as @xmath74 since @xmath75 the index of refraction can be approximated as @xmath76 under typical experimental conditions @xmath77 is @xmath78 , introducing only a small error by using this approximation .",
    "now , eq .  ( [ eqn : phi_cor ] ) can be written as @xmath79 where the integration is along the line - of - sight @xmath39 and @xmath80 is the column density .    the real part of @xmath81 , proportional to @xmath82 , yields the phase shift , whereas the imaginary part , proportional to @xmath83 , yields the absorption .",
    "since @xmath67 is constant for fixed detuning @xmath34 , the phase shift is directly proportional to the column density . since eq .",
    "( [ eqn : polphi ] ) satisfies the kramers - kronig relation @xmath84 the ratio between the phase shift and the absorption is constant for a given detuning .",
    "in order to create a phase contrast image of the atoms , the plane wave part of the probe field has to be phase shifted as is described in ",
    "[ subsection : imagingthephase ] .",
    "this is commonly achieved by fourier transformation using a lens .",
    "the concept of the imaging setup used in our experiment is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pci - setup ] .",
    "a two - lens setup is used to generate a sharp image of the atoms on a camera .",
    "the first lens @xmath85 with focal distance @xmath86 is placed at a distance @xmath87 from the center of the magnetic trap .",
    "the second lens @xmath88 with focal distance @xmath89 is placed at a distance @xmath90 from the ccd camera .",
    "the distance between both lenses is @xmath91 .",
    "the combination of both lenses creates a sharp image of the cloud on the ccd camera with a magnification @xmath92 where the uncertainty is the result of the uncertainty in the focal distance of the lenses .     with focal distance @xmath87 which is placed at a distance @xmath87 from the center .",
    "a sharp image is created by placing the lens @xmath88 at distance @xmath93 from @xmath85 with focal length @xmath90 at a distance @xmath90 from the ccd camera . the phase spot ( ps )",
    "is placed in the focal plain of the non - diffracted probe beam . ]    in order to shift the phase of the plane wave part of the light a phase spot is placed in the back focal plane ( fourier plane ) of the two lenses , which lies for these parameters beyond the second lens @xmath88 .",
    "this position can be found easily in the experiment , since the parallel probe beam has its waist at the back focal plane and therefore the phase spot is placed at this position .     as a function of the accumulated phase @xmath26 for different phases @xmath94 of the phase spot . ]",
    "figure [ fig : phase - phi - theta ] shows the intensity @xmath95 as a function of the accumulated phase @xmath26 for different values of @xmath22 based on eq .",

    "[ fig : phase - phi - theta ] .",

    "the effective camera resolution of @xmath108 per pixel is comparable to the diffraction limit @xmath109 of the imaging lens @xmath85 with radius @xmath110 for probe light with a wavelength @xmath111 .",
    "a phase contrast image of a bec at nonzero temperature contains the column density distribution of the two - component cloud , _",
    "i.e.  _ a bec and a thermal cloud which can be distinguished from each other due to their distinct density distributions .",
    "in order to derive the relevant parameters from such an image , like the thermal ( excited ) density @xmath112 , the condensate ( ground state ) density @xmath113 , and the temperature @xmath114 , the measured profiles are fitted to a theoretical model describing the cloud .",
    "various models exist in literature in which the interaction between the condensed and thermal atoms are taken into account to various degrees . in this paper",
    "we compare our measurements to three of these models .",
    "the first model is the commonly used bimodal distribution in which all interactions between the two components are ignored .",

    "the third model incorporates the effect of the density distribution of the thermal atoms on the condensed atoms as well .",
    "below , the density distribution of the thermal cloud and the bec in each of these models are described consecutively .    in the first model , referred to as the ideal model , the chemical potential is given by @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the interaction parameter for bosons with @xmath117-wave scattering length @xmath118 and mass @xmath119 @xcite . since there are no interactions between condensed atoms with density @xmath120 and thermal atoms with density @xmath121 , @xmath122 does not depend on @xmath121 .",

    "the second model , denoted as the semi - ideal model , does include interactions , but only the contribution of the mean - field potential of the condensate to the thermal density distribution is taken into account @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath122 remains unchanged : @xmath140 , but the energy of the thermal atoms is changed due to the mean - field potential of the condensed atoms and written as @xmath141    we calculate the density distribution in this semi - ideal model by numerical integration of eq .",

    "therefore , it seems evident to analyze the measured density profiles by fitting them to a theoretical model in which only @xmath122 and @xmath114 are to be determined .",
    "however , this approach can be applied only if the size and the height of the measured profiles can be determined absolutely . since the aforementioned pci method is expected to do so",
    ", we can apply such a fit procedure here .    in the commonly used imaging methods",

    "the experimental conditions favor the use of one of these measures above the others .",
    "being able to describe the complete cloud by @xmath122 and @xmath114 , as is done in the theoretical models , is expected to yield a higher accuracy , since different measures for the chemical potential and temperature are combined which depend differently on experimental parameters such as the magnification , detuning and the trap frequencies .",
    "furthermore , it allows for taking the interaction between the condensed and thermal atoms into account .",
    "this interaction is ignored in the vast majority of experiments in this field , in contrast to the theoretical description of a condensate at finite temperature found in many textbooks .",
    "our pci setup is expected to yield an accurate and absolute determination of both the density and the size of the cloud and measuring _ in situ_prevents the need to account for the expansion of the cloud .",
    "therefore , since all measures are absolute , @xmath122 and @xmath114 are expected to fully describe the measured density profiles , given the fixed experimental parameters such as the magnification and the trap frequencies .",
    "this allows us to directly compare our measured density profiles to the three mean - field models described in the previous section .",
    "the pci method not only yields absolute density profiles , it is expected to yield a more accurate determination of the thermal fraction for low temperatures compared to absorption imaging as well . since the accumulated phase for the dense bec can be multiple times @xmath152 , a significant phase is accumulated in the thermal cloud , without saturating the signal in the bec . in absorption imaging on the other hand , the optical density of the thermal cloud",
    "is strongly reduced in order to reduce the optical density of the bec to the order of @xmath0 .",
    "especially for low temperatures , when only the low density tail of the thermal distribution spatially extends the bec , it turns out to be difficult to distinguish between both components in the experiment .",
    "various schemes have been used to enhance the contrast between the thermal cloud and the condensate , for example by making a two - pass fit routine , first only on the thermal cloud , followed by the condensate and thermal cloud while fixing the temperature found in the first pass @xcite .",
    "another scheme used is spatial separation of both components using bragg spectroscopy and fitting both parts separately @xcite . in the pci method",
    "the contrast between both components is sufficient for all measured temperatures and prevents the need to introduce elaborate schemes to enhance the contrast .",
    "imaging the atoms is conducted in such a way that the periodicity of the intensity of the pci technique is used . since the intensity signal varies periodically as a function of @xmath26 ( eq .  ( [ eqn : phase_phasespot_full ] ) ) , the intensity signal shows rings in the intensity profile for sufficiently large values of @xmath26 ( seefig .",
    "[ fig : phase - phi - theta ] ) .",
    "the number of rings depends on @xmath26 , which scales with the density and the detuning @xmath34 as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : realphase ] ) and [ eqn : polphi ] .",
    "the detuning is a parameter which can be tuned accurately in a wide range ( up to @xmath153mhz ) using acoustic - optical modulators ( aoms ) allowing us to make images with an adjustable number of rings . due to the ring pattern",
    "the imaging lens can be put in position very sensitively allowing us to resolve features down to @xmath0@xmath102 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath34 can be chosen in such a way that the intensity profile of the bec shows rings and the less dense thermal cloud yields a significant intensity signal as well , even for low temperatures .",
    "the resulting effective dynamic range of this method is therefore increased by the periodic dependence of the intensity on the accumulated phase .",
    "a drawback of this method lies in the fact that the bec acts as a gradient index lens , the lensing being stronger for smaller @xmath34 .",
    "the effect of the lensing on the imaging resolution is estimated by a computer simulation in which the fresnel - kirchhoff diffraction integral is numerically integrated . in this simulation",
    "the finite size of the imaging lenses is explicitly taken into account .",
    "the mutual distances between the bec , lenses , phase spot and image plane are chosen identical to the values used in the experiment .",
    "the intensity distribution at the image plane is used to estimate the effects of the refraction of the bec on the imaging resolution .",
    "if the diffraction is too large , the higher diffraction orders can miss the aperture of the imaging lenses and will degrade the resolution of the image .",
    "this simulation yields an upper limit for the allowed phase shift of the bec and therefore a lower limit of the applied detuning given the condensate density and dimensions . in the experiment we are in the regime in which the aperture of the lenses is not limiting the resolution , although the onset of a slight deformation of the density profile is observed for the highest condensate densities . for the typical parameters , the maximum focal length of the bec",
    "is found to be of the order of @xmath154@xmath102 . even though the diffraction is not too large for the apertures in the imaging path , the imaging lenses have to be placed in focus within a few tens of micrometers to prevent distortions of the imaged intensity profile , since the imaged object itself acts like a lens .",
    "the phase spot has to be aligned accurately as well , since all of the plane wave light has to propagate through the phase spot . in the long axis of the cloud",
    "the diffraction is weak , and for too large a phase spot the diffracted light propagates through the phase spot as well . in order to make a off between the two criteria that the phase spot should be large enough that the non - diffracted light is phase - shifted , but small enough that the diffracted light is not",
    ", the phase spot has a size of only a few times the waist of the probe beam . as a consequence",
    ", the phase spot is easily misaligned .",
    "misalignment of the phase spot leads to reflection of the probe beam on the edges of the phase spot and possibly shifting the phase of the light , which is diffracted by the atoms . as a result of the misalignment we notice a higher , tilted intensity profile , which is easily detected , since we have several maxima in the intensity profile .",

    "[ fig : phase - phi - theta ] , the intensity as a function of the phase varies in certain ranges rapidly .",
    "choosing a detuning in such a way that the maximum phase lies in this range , a slight increase in the density leading to a slight increase in the maximum phase leads to a large change in the intensity in the center of the cloud making the method very sensitive to small density changes .    in the experiment imaging the atoms",

    "the magnification scheme used causes the probe beam to get blown up to such an extend that the beam profile is no longer smooth on the camera due to interference effects caused by dust and small scratches on the imaging optics . in principle , these imperfections are canceled in the final images , but since the imaging path is not interferometrically stable in between the acquisition of the three images , some distortions remain .      to demonstrate the pci method ,",
    "atoms are cooled below the critical temperature @xmath160 in a @xmath161 trap and imaged with a probe beam with an intensity @xmath162 for @xmath101@xmath163 .",

    "small fringes close to the bec are the result of the lenses being slightly out of focus .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      repeated measurements are done in the regime where three - body losses limit the density of condensed atoms .",
    "the total number of condensed atoms @xmath137 is therefore approximately constant and the results are used to determine the sensitivity as well as the reproducibility of the pci method .",

    "the fluctuations in these results are only a few percent for both the number of thermal and condensed atoms and this measurement shows the accuracy of the pci method over the full temperature range .      generating clouds above as well as below the transition temperature allows us to determine the temperature at which condensation sets in .",
    "the popov model yields @xmath122 and @xmath114 in both regions , where @xmath122 becomes negative for temperatures above @xmath172 .",

    "only two relevant parameters , @xmath122 and @xmath114 , are needed to describe the measured clouds given the harmonic confinement as @xmath122 and @xmath114 determine both the peak density and size of both components of the cloud .",
    "this procedure is used to discriminate between three models describing the equilibrium properties of trapped clouds at nonzero temperatures , each model incorporating the interactions between thermal atoms and condensed atoms differently .",
    "we resolve the effect of the interaction on the density distribution of thermal cloud as well as the smaller effect the interaction has on the density distribution of the condensate .",
    "the model accounting for these effects gives consistent results over the complete temperature range .",
    "the imaging scheme is used to determine the number of atoms within one percent from shot - to - shot at our typical number of condensed atoms between @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "systematic errors are estimated by comparing the different measures for the chemical potential and we find the uncertainty in the number of number of condensed atoms to be roughly five percent .",
    "pci can be used both below and above the transition temperature and we used it to determine @xmath160 and derived the shift of the transition temperature due to the interactions .",
