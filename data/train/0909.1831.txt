    "the elasticity of biopolymers , probed using single molecule methods , is often analyzed using the worm - like chain ( wlc)@xcite model or the freely - jointed chain ( fjc ) model .",
    "for example , the force - extension curves ( fecs ) of double stranded ( ds ) dna ( at high monovalent salt concentration ) are accurately reproduced using the wlc model with essentially the persistence length ( @xmath0 ) as the only adjustable parameter while the fjc model does not fit the data@xcite .",
    "the wlc model is also successful in describing the fec of ssrna  @xcite and proteins  @xcite . in contrast , the fec of ssdna is better explained using the fjc model than the wlc model@xcite . given that the values of @xmath0 of ssdna and ssrna are similar  @xcite , it is hard to understand the source of the discrepancy .",
    "in addition , for polysaccharides  @xcite the fjc is used to extract the parameters from the fec .    here",
    ", we use general theoretical arguments to determine the polymer model that best describes the measured fec .",
    "in particular , we derive a complete picture of the stretching physics of polymers at relative high forces , solely in terms of @xmath0 and the tensile screening length @xmath9  @xcite , where @xmath10 is the thermal energy and @xmath6 is the stretching force . in the process , the fecs for the fjc and",
    "wlc models naturally appear as limiting cases within a unified theory for the stretching of polymer models , regardless of the nature of interactions between the monomers .",
    "because the theory makes use of only general geometrical and scaling arguments that describe the response of a polymer under tension in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath11 , we believe that our approach can be used to analyze the fecs of virtually any model polymer , and more importantly , many classes of biopolymers .",
    "we propose that the fec for any polymer should exhibit a near universal behavior . at very small forces",
    "we expect the extension to scale as @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "as the force increases the fec could exhibit a plateau region ( poor solvent )  @xcite or a universal behavior ( good solvent ) where the extension scales as @xmath13  @xcite ( pincus regime ) . here",
    "we show that this behavior can not extend beyond the region @xmath14 . in the force range",
    "@xmath15 with @xmath1 being approximately the monomer size , the fec should coincide with the prediction of the wlc model . for @xmath16",
    "the polymer is better described using the fjc model .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath17 , the fec can be fit using the analytical results from wlc or fjc model regardless of the interactions that stabilize the ordered structures of the biopolymer at low forces ( @xmath18 ) . the model that provides",
    "the most accurate fit of the measured fec depends on the force range of the fec as well as the specific biopolymer , which is characterized by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , the elasticity of the biopolymer ( or any polymer for that matter ) depends on the force  @xcite .",
    "for a chain subject to a force @xmath6 along the @xmath19-axis , the tensile energy is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the angle between bond @xmath22 and the force vector . in the limit",
    "the tensile screening length @xmath9@xcite is less than @xmath0 , the excluded volume or other solvent - mediated intrachain interactions are irrelevant@xcite .",
    "we make the physically reasonable assumption that , at high values of @xmath6 , _ the chain hamiltonian has the global minimum when all the bond angles are zero _ , which corresponds to the rod state . for chains with special bond constraints such as the freely rotating chain , we shall assume that we can define virtual bonds and virtual bond angles that satisfy this assumption .      in the following",
    "we denote @xmath23 as the average with respect to @xmath24 of @xmath25 as an arbitrary function of some angle @xmath26 .",
    "for any two bonds @xmath22 and @xmath27 with bond angle @xmath28 , because of the triangle inequality @xmath29 , the average of @xmath30 with respect to _ only _ @xmath24 satisfies : @xmath31 and becomes independent of @xmath22 and @xmath27 . as the force becomes so large such that @xmath32 , eq .   for _ any _ two bonds reduces to @xmath33 on the other hand ,",
    "the contributions due only to the intra - chain interactions lead to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the chain hamiltonian _ of any form _ and @xmath36 is the arc - length .",
    "the expression in eq .  , which defines the persistence length , is assumed to be true for many types of uncharged biopolymers and for polyelectrolytes at sufficiently high counter - ion concentrations . at high forces , the contribution from the tensile energy to the average in eq .",
    "becomes comparable to the contribution from the chain interaction .",
    "thus , the arc - length @xmath37 at which the two contributions equal decreases as the force increases .",
    "eventually , as the force approaches @xmath38 such that @xmath39 , we obtain @xmath40 which leads to an estimate of @xmath38 , @xmath41 with the constant @xmath42 in the range from @xmath43 to 4 ( see below ) . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the average cosine is determined by the tensile energy @xmath24 whose effects on the chain are ( much ) larger than intrachain interactions . at such high forces ,",
    "the bonds align themselves along the force with small fluctuations . at forces above @xmath38 , the stretching equation of a discrete semiflexible chain satisfying",
    "the above bond angle assumption becomes that of the fjc , i.e. @xmath45 thus , @xmath38 should be viewed as a crossover force because above @xmath38 all biopolymers should behave as fjcs .",
    "note that , in order for @xmath38 to be finite , @xmath1 in equation   must not vanish , i.e. , the polymer chain should be viewed as a series of connected discrete links .    a similar form and notion of the crossover force",
    "were already pointed out elsewhere  @xcite for two specific models , wlc and freely - rotating chain ( frc ) .",
    "however , either the _ explicit _ form of the hamiltonian ( wlc ) was required or simulations for frc were needed to infer an empirical value of @xmath38 . here ,",
    "general arguments based on the interplay between the force and intrinsic chain stiffness alone leads to an estimate of @xmath38 ( eq . ) .",
    "more importantly , @xmath38 can be obtained without assuming any specific energy function for the polymer , and hence should be considered as a universal behavior for any discrete semiflexible chain .",
    "the critical value @xmath38 defined in eqn .   could , in principle , be somewhat more complicated especially if the bonds connecting the monomers are extensible . in this case , the stretching equation at high @xmath6 for the fjc ( eq . )",
    "has the form  @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the stretch modulus that has the dimension of force .",
    "consider the regime @xmath48 ( the lower bound is when @xmath49 ) .",
    "similar to the pincus argument at low force ( @xmath50 - the kuhn length ) in which the chain can be viewed as a series of blobs , the polymer breaks up into a series of segments whose length is _ on the order of _ the kuhn length and behaves _ almost _ similarly to a fjc of kuhn segments ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : regimes ] ) . the relative extension in this force regime is , at most , @xmath51 .",
    "however , we are not in the true fjc regime discussed above .",
    "the intrinsic intra - chain interactions , which tend to prevent the chain from bending , are relevant .",
    "the relative extension @xmath52 must be larger than that of the fjc with bond length @xmath1 , namely @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we have the bound , @xmath54 . in analogy with eq .  ,",
    "we can formally write @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the segment length of the effective fjc , which should be regarded as an effective force - dependent kuhn length .    if the chain is viewed as a sequence of connected segments with effective length @xmath56 that resembles the fjc , the average cosine of the angle formed by any two of these @xmath57-segments is given by eq .   where @xmath1 is replaced by @xmath57 : @xmath58 the assumption that @xmath59 has to be justified",
    "_ a posteriori_. the intrinsic tangent - tangent correlation of any two @xmath22 and @xmath27 effective monomer - like @xmath57-segments is @xmath60 by equating the two equations   and   ( with @xmath61 ) we can relate @xmath57 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 using : @xmath62 it follows from eq . that the force - dependent kuhn segment @xmath63 is determined not only by the intrinsic stiffness of the chain through @xmath0 but also by the tension through @xmath11 .",
    "the tensile screening length , which satisfies @xmath11(@xmath64 ) @xmath65 @xmath56 ( @xmath66 ) is similar to the _ deflection length _ proposed by odijk  @xcite using the explicit quadratic form of the hamiltonian .",
    "the fec in this regime satisfies , @xmath67 which coincides with the results for the wlc when @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "thus , by merely using the analogy to a semiflexible chain , which behaves as a fjc at high force and considering the effects of the intrinsic segment correlation and the effects of tension , we have obtained the characteristic stretching equation for _ any _ semiflexible chain .",
    "such a regime exists in all semiflexible chains that satisfy the bond angle assumption",
    ". we shall refer to this as the effective fjc or wlc regime , generalizing the traditional name for any semiflexible chain .",
    "in practical applications the terms effective fjc and wlc can be used interchangeably .",
    "for the two regimes fjc and wlc discussed above , we assume that the generalized equation for @xmath57 takes the following simple form , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a model - dependent parameter .",
    "this equation reflects the observation that when @xmath71 , @xmath56 is almost @xmath63 ( @xmath72 ) and the chain behaves as an effective fjc ; and when @xmath16 , @xmath56 tends to @xmath1 ( @xmath73 ) and the chain behaves as a true fjc .",
    "thus , we have the equation for the two strong stretching regimes : @xmath74 which reduces exactly to the form for the discrete wlc  @xcite when @xmath75 .",
    "because of the upper limit of @xmath57 , which is @xmath76 , the lower limit on the force for observing the effective fjc regime ( assuming @xmath77 ) is : @xmath78 here , @xmath79 can be called the crossover force to the effective fjc regime from a low force regime ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : regimes ] ) .",
    "the physics of the stretching of all biopolymer molecules using discrete semiflexible chains is summarized in fig.[fig : regimes ] . at very low forces",
    ", the extension increases linearly with the force  @xcite . for larger forces , but not too large , such that the tensile screening length is still significantly larger than the kuhn length , one reaches the pincus regime of blobs where the extension scales either linearly with the force ( ideal chains ) or as @xmath80 ( self - avoiding chains)@xcite . as the force increases until it is larger than @xmath79 , @xmath11 becomes smaller than the kuhn length , the chain behaves as an effective fjc with the law @xmath81 .",
    "eventually , when @xmath11 becomes smaller than @xmath82 ( @xmath16 ) , the chain behaves as a true fjc under high tension with the fec law @xmath83 .",

    "the ratio @xmath95 is large enough to clearly observe the effective fjc regime . from equations   and",
    ", it can be seen that plotting @xmath96 against @xmath97 in double logarithmic scale would give us the characteristic slopes of @xmath98 and @xmath99 for the effective fjc and fjc regimes , respectively .",

    "our analysis provides a theoretical basis for choosing the appropriate polymer model to analyze the fecs of biopolymers . in order to choose a specific model",

    "it should be stressed that even if @xmath1 is greatly increased , up to the conceivably maximum value of 3.4 nm or one double helix turn , @xmath38 still exceeds @xmath115pn .",
    "these estimates show that the fec of dsdna ( excluding the overstretching region ) should be in only the effective fjc regime , which explains the success of the wlc in quantitatively describing the fec of dsdna .",

    "thus , both @xmath79 and @xmath38 are small enough that they can be accessed in typical lot experiments , making it practical to infer the @xmath6-dependent changes in the elasticity .",
    "the values of @xmath79 and @xmath38 readily explain why the measured fec for poly - u using optical tweezers  @xcite in the force range from about 0.5 pn to 50 pn , which is about @xmath38 , is best described using the wlc model .",
    "we predict that the fjc behavior should emerge for forces larger than 50 pn for poly - u .",

    "comparison of our predictions with the fec data for ssdna reported by rief et al .",
    "@xcite in the force range from 10pn to 200pn and in tris buffer further validates the present analysis . in a different paper  @xcite , dessinges et al .",
    "combined the data with their data on ssdna in the force range from 0.05pn to 20pn and in a different buffer ( see fig . 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using extensive data on ssdna",
    ", they showed that at very low force , self - avoidance and electrostatic effects play dominant roles , and hence the elasticity of ssdna is qualitatively different from the high force regimes .",
    "indeed , by taking into account the electrostatic interactions in the so - called modified ( extensible ) fjc model , dessinges et al .",
    "explained the low force part of the fec .",
    "they also showed that _ both _ the wlc and the `` bare '' modified fjc , when applied independently , failed to fit the _ entire _ high force part ( @xmath5 ) of the fec . here",
    "we show that the fec above @xmath131 ( data by rief et al .",
    "@xcite ) can be quantitatively analyzed using our theory .",
    "the equation for the high stretch regimes ( eq .  ) , which has both the wlc and fjc high force behaviors , provides a very good fit to the data .",
    "we notice that the modified fjc model by dessinges et al . with electrostatic interactions actually failed to fit the high force ( @xmath132 ) portion of the fec  @xcite . it could be argued that the good fit to the lower portion of the fec was mainly because the electrostatic interactions , which play dominant roles , were well taken into account .",
    "the fact that whether the fjc or wlc is used for the low force regime should not considerably affect the outcome of the fit .",
    "but for the high force regime , it is essential to do a force range analysis prior to the actual fit , as it is done here .",
    "our extracted values are @xmath133 nm , @xmath134 nm and @xmath135 leading to @xmath136 pn and @xmath137 pn ( see fig.[fig : fit_dessinges ] ) .    * protein ( pevk domain ) * : pevk ( pro - glu - val - lys ) domain is a proline - rich domain of the muscle protein titin and it has no definite folded structure . using the accepted values @xmath138 nm  @xcite and @xmath139 nm , @xmath140 pn , which is well in the covered range of almost all single molecule apparatuses , and @xmath141 pn .",
    "we expect that the wlc is more suitable for the pevk domain than the fjc , and indeed fecs in the force range from 10 to 200pn were analyzed using wlc  @xcite",
    ". however , we can see the need for a discrete model rather than the continuum wlc to obtain a better fit .",
    "* polysaccharides * : linear polysaccharides that occur naturally in a variety of cellular structures are subject to tensile stress . at high forces",
    "the sugar rings undergo a transition from chair to boat conformation , which clearly changes their elastic properties  @xcite . unlike other systems ( dsdna , for example )",
    "the change in elasticity is associated with enthalpic changes as a result of the conformational transition .",
    "surprisingly , it is found that over a wide range of forces the fec is best explained by the fjc model  @xcite , which can be fully explained using our theory . for cellulose with the value @xmath142 nm  @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath143pn .",
    "this means that excluding the overstretch range , the entire range of fec for cellulose reported in references by marszalek et al .",
    "@xcite obtained using afm with force range of 10 to 1000 pn is best described using the fjc .",
    "the same observation can be made for other polysaccharides , such as dextran ( @xmath144 nm in the chair conformation and @xmath145 nm in the boat conformation ) and amylose ( @xmath146 nm ( chair ) and @xmath147 nm ( boat ) )  @xcite .",
    "thus , the intrinsic properties of polysaccharides show that this class of molecules behave as fjcs .    in all the above examples ,",
    "it is necessary to assess the range of force in any particular fec before using the polymer model that can best describe the data . in most cases , it is necessary to consider both the semi - flexibility and discreteness of the biopolymer .",
    "models such as the discrete wlc model@xcite and the tc model  @xcite are better for most fitting purposes . in analyzing most of the currently available data we find that these two models are adequate .",
    "however , as shown by dessinges et al .",
    "@xcite the variations in the elasticity of ssdna over a wide range of forces will require a combination of models .",
    "our theory accounts for @xmath6-dependent variations in the elasticity in terms of naturally occurring length scales as long as @xmath148 .",
    "below @xmath149 , additional forces may stabilize specific structures .      for each biopolymer",
    ", there is a threshold force at which the transition to bond overstretching occurs .",
    "inextensible models can be used to fit only the experimental fecs below the threshold force . from the approximate equation in the high stretch regime",
    "it can be shown that the slope of the fec above @xmath79 in the log - linear scale is a strictly monotonically increasing quantity for a generic semiflexible chain .",
    "on the other hand , in the region where overstretching effect is significant , the extension can be approximated as  @xcite @xmath150 , where @xmath47 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 are positive constants .",
    "it can be shown that the rate of change of the slope in the region @xmath153 ( overstretched ) is always negative .",
    "then for a fec with overstretching , the threshold force is the one ( @xmath154 ) at which the slope of the curve @xmath155 vs. @xmath52 stops increasing .",
    "a slope that stays constant or decreases would signify the failure of the inextensible model .",
    "the simple analysis , that accounts for extensibility through the stretch modulus @xmath47 , allows us to gauge the threshold force from the fec .",
    "if the data are precise , we can take the numerical derivative of @xmath155 in the region @xmath17 and detect the force at which it reaches a maximum value or a plateau .",
    "otherwise , the practical solution would be to plot @xmath156 vs @xmath52 in the log - linear plane then detect the change in the slope above @xmath79 by inspection .",
    "although not rigorous , it turns out to be an effective way as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : threshold_detection ] . for the poly - u data  @xcite at various salt concentrations and at forces @xmath157pn ,",
    ", the practical technique reveals no decrease in the slope in the @xmath132 region ( data not shown ) .",
    "therefore , we expect no overstretching in poly - u or ssdna .",
    "our theory shows that the wlc and fjc models at large forces are the two limiting universal behaviors for virtually all polymers and especially biopolymers .",
    "the crossover from wlc to fjc is determined by the persistence length @xmath0 and the monomer spacing @xmath1 .",
    "the validity of the theory is strongly demonstrated through the excellent agreement with simulation results and the successful analysis of the force extension curves of a diverse set of biopolymers .",
    "the two crossover forces , @xmath38 and @xmath79 , which demarcate the boundary between the applicability of the wlc and fjc , provide a physical picture of the @xmath6-dependent elasticity of biopolymers .",
    "the derived @xmath122-rule is a convenient way to obtain a good estimate of the persistence length of the biopolymer from the measured fec , which in turn yields the model that is most appropriate for analyzing the fec .",
    "the theory also shows that complete understanding of the elasticity of biopolymers requires measurement of fecs for a wide range of forces as obtained for ssdna  @xcite .",
