    "in a recent paper @xcite reported interferometric observations of the mercury - manganese star  ( hd  145389 , hr  6023 , hip  79101 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , spectral type b9:p(hgmn ) , @xmath5 ) , which is a binary star .",
    "this object belongs to a class of peculiar non - magnetic b - type stars that show abundance anomalies of several elements , some of which ( such as hg and mn ) can be enhanced by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "depletions of other elements are seen as well .",
    "these anomalies are thought to be produced by radiatively - driven diffusion and gravitational settling @xcite .",
    "the observations of @xcite spatially resolve the companion of  for the first time .",
    "the object had previously been known as a single - lined spectroscopic binary with a period of about 560 days @xcite and an eccentric orbit .",
    "their interferometric measurements with the navy prototype optical interferometer ( npoi ) allowed @xcite to measure the brightness of the companion and use it to estimate its spectral type .",
    "this , in turn , facilitated their detection of spectral lines of the secondary for the first time in spectra taken at the dominion astrophysical observatory .",
    "the secondary was also detected spectroscopically by @xcite .",
    "the system is therefore technically now double - lined , although as pointed out by @xcite the handful of secondary radial velocities they were able to measure with great difficulty do not provide a firm constraint on the velocity semiamplitude of that star .",
    "furthermore , they found that the combination of their high - precision interferometric orbit with the elements of the single - lined spectroscopic orbit reported by @xcite led to absolute masses for the components that are inconsistent with the spectral types .",
    "therefore , although the total mass of the binary is now fairly well known , the individual masses can not yet be determined dynamically .",
    "such basic properties of the stars are of considerable interest given the chemical peculiarities of this class of objects , which have been the subject of extensive studies of many different kinds ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we were puzzled by this apparent inconsistency between the seemingly precise radial velocities and the astrometry , and we wondered whether other velocity measurements available in the literature might clarify the situation .",
    "in addition ,  was observed in the course of the _ hipparcos _ mission @xcite .",
    "those measurements clearly revealed the motion of the center of light due to the binary orbit , suggesting they could be used to good advantage in the determination of the individual masses .",
    "the motivation for this paper is therefore threefold : _",
    "i ) _ to show how , in the absence of spectroscopy , the astrometric measurements from _ hipparcos _ can indeed be combined with the npoi observations of @xcite to yield reliable masses for both stars for the first time , purely astrometrically .",
    "this serves as an interesting example of the value of the _ hipparcos _ intermediate data for solving or improving binary orbits and inferring other stellar properties ; _ ii ) _ to readdress the issue of the @xcite velocities in light of the new solution .",
    "we show that those data are not really inconsistent with the astrometry , but do lack critical phase coverage and must be supplemented by other information in order to be useful ; _ iii ) _ to incorporate additional velocity measurements not previously used , in order to further strengthen the orbital solution .",
    "the final masses not only have much improved precision , but are consistent with the mass - luminosity relation as given by current stellar evolution models .",
    "the original npoi measurements obtained by @xcite consist of interferometric squared visibilities ( @xmath6 ) and closure phases collected on 25 separate nights from 1997 april to 2005 july .",
    "the visibilities of each night were combined to infer the angular separation ( @xmath7 ) and position angle ( @xmath8 ) of the binary , and these were subsequently used to derive the elements of the astrometric orbit .",
    "the measurements published are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , along with the corresponding error ellipses .",
    "the residuals from the orbit are only a few tenths of a milli - arc second ( mas ) in angular separation , and a few tenths of a degree in position angle , indicating the very high precision of those measurements .",
    "the orbit has an angular semimajor axis of 32.1  mas , which , when combined with the _ hipparcos _ parallax ( @xmath9 mas ) allowed @xcite to infer the total mass of the binary as @xmath10  m@xmath1 .",
    "additionally , the interferometric measurements yielded the average magnitude difference between the primary and secondary of  at two wavelengths : @xmath11 ( 5500   ) @xmath12 mag and @xmath11 ( 7000   ) @xmath13 mag . as discussed below this information",
    "is key to the mass determinations .",
    "the star  was observed by the _",
    "hipparcos _ satellite during its 37-month astrometric mission under the designation hip  79101 , and was measured a total of 76 times from 1989 december to 1993 march , or a slightly over two orbital cycles of the binary .",
    "each measurement consisted of a one - dimensional position ( ` abscissa ' ) along a great circle representing the scanning direction of the satellite , tied to an absolute frame of reference known as the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) .",
    "in addition to providing the trigonometric parallax as well as the position and proper motion of the center of light based on the synthesis of all these measurements ( the so - called standard 5-parameter fit ) , the astrometric solution reported in the catalogue @xcite revealed a perturbation that was modeled as orbital motion , since the binary nature of the object was already known .",
    "several of the orbital elements including the period ( @xmath14 ) , the eccentricity ( @xmath15 ) , and the longitude of periastron of the primary ( @xmath16 ) were held fixed at the values determined spectroscopically by @xcite to facilitate the solution , and the other elements were solved for .",
    "these included the semimajor axis of the center of light ( @xmath17 mas ) , the inclination angle ( @xmath18 ) , the position angle of the ascending node ( @xmath19 , j2000 ) , and the time of periastron passage ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "more recently @xcite reported a reanalysis of the _ hipparcos _ intermediate data , still adopting @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath21 , as well as @xmath20 from the spectroscopic work by @xcite , but with the added assumption that the secondary contributes no light to the system .",
    "this provides a connection between the measured semimajor axis @xmath22 and the radial velocity semiamplitude @xmath23 , which was adopted also from @xcite .",
    "their results for the inclination ( @xmath24 ) and especially the position angle of the node ( @xmath25 ) are quite different from the _ hipparcos _ solution , but we now know from the detection of the secondary by @xcite that this star _",
    "does _ contribute some light , so the assumption of @xcite is not a good one in this particular case .    as it turns out , the information provided by the _ hipparcos _",
    "data is complementary to that given by the ground - based interferometry , and as we show below the combination of the two allows the individual masses of  to be determined independently of any assumptions , and independently also of any spectroscopic information . since some of the orbital elements reported by @xcite are much improved compared to @xcite , a reanalysis of the _ hipparcos _ data with those constraints would therefore seem to be in order .",
    "better still , the _ hipparcos _ data can be combined directly with the npoi observations in a simultaneous least - squares solution yielding all the elements at once .",
    "this is the path we follow in the next section .",
    "the intermediate data from _ hipparcos _ are available in the form of one - dimensional ` abscissa residuals ' , which are the residuals from the standard 5-parameter solutions published in the catalogue @xcite . by extending the 5-parameter model to include orbital motion , as done by the _",
    "team , these observations can be used to strengthen the combined solution .",
    "the nominal errors of these measurements have a median of 1.85 mas .",
    "long - baseline interferometry provides information on the relative orbit of the binary ( with semimajor axis @xmath26 ) as well as the brightness difference , whereas the _ hipparcos _ observations refer to the motion of the center of light of the binary relative to the barycenter ( with semimajor axis @xmath22 ) , on an absolute frame of reference .",
    "the two kinds of measurements are redundant to some extent because they both constrain the elements @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath27 , @xmath16 , @xmath28 , and @xmath20 . their simultaneous use in a global fit is therefore expected to lead to a more robust solution .",
    "the use of the _ hipparcos _ measurements introduces several other parameters that must be solved for at the same time , including corrections to the catalog values of the position of the barycenter ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) at the mean reference epoch of 1991.25 , and corrections to the proper motion components ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) and to the parallax ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 . ] .",
    "the formalism for modeling the abscissa residuals follows closely that described by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , including the correlations between measurements from the two independent data reduction consortia that processed the original _ hipparcos _ observations @xcite .",
    "the details are reviewed in the appendix . with the inclusion of the semimajor axes @xmath26 and",
    "@xmath22 there are 13 unknowns altogether . we solve for them simultaneously using standard non - linear least - squares techniques @xcite .",
    "in the course of the iterations we noticed that one of the npoi observations ( taken on 2004 july 21 ) gave an unusually large residual in both angular separation ( @xmath35 mas , or @xmath36 ) and position angle ( @xmath37 , or @xmath38 ) .",
    "the same observation stands out in the solution by @xcite with similar residuals , and is one of several measurements taken at nearly the same orbital phase , so is not particularly critical .",
    "we have elected to exclude it from the solution .",
    "the relative weights between the npoi and _ hipparcos _ observations were assigned according to their individual errors . since internal errors are not always realistic , we adjusted them by applying a scale factor in such a way as to achieve a reduced @xmath39 value near unity separately for each type of observation .",
    "this was done by iterations .",
    "a similar procedure was followed by @xcite .",
    "this resulted in scale factors of 0.34 and 0.24 for the npoi angular separations and position angles , and 0.84 for the _ hipparcos _ measurements .",
    "the results of this fit are given in table  [ tab : elements ] under the heading npoi+_hipparcos_. for reference we include also the spectroscopic solution reported by @xcite , the fit by @xcite , and the constrained solution by the _ hipparcos _ team .",
    "the position angle of the node given by @xcite requires a change of quadrant to conform to the usual convention that the ascending node ( @xmath28 ) corresponds to the node at which the secondary is receding from the observer .",
    "the orbital elements from our fit are generally seen to be consistent with those of @xcite ( whose solution combines interferometry with radial velocities ) , but with considerably smaller uncertainties .",
    "the projection of the photocentric orbit on the plane of the sky along with a schematic representation the _ hipparcos _ measurements is seen in figure  [ fig : hiporbit ] , where the axes are parallel to the right ascension and declination directions .",
    "because these measurements are one - dimensional in nature , their exact location on the plane of the sky can not be shown graphically .",
    "the filled circles represent the predicted location on the computed orbit .",
    "the dotted lines connected to each filled circle indicate the scanning direction of the _ hipparcos _ satellite for each measurement , and show which side of the orbit the residual is on .",
    "the length of each dotted line represents the magnitude of the @xmath40 residual .",
    "residuals '' are not to be confused with the `` abscissa residuals '' , which we refer to loosely here as _ hipparcos",
    "_ `` observations '' or `` measurements '' .",
    "the abscissa residuals are in fact residuals from the standard 5-parameter fit reported in the _ hipparcos _ catalogue , as stated earlier , whereas the @xmath40 residuals ( or simply `` residuals '' ) are the difference between the abscissa residuals and the computed position of the star from a model that incorporates orbital elements . ]",
    "the short line segments at the end of and perpendicular to the dotted lines indicate the direction along which the actual observation lies , although the precise location is undetermined . occasionally more than one measurement was taken along the same scanning direction , in which case two or more short line segments appear on the same dotted lines .",
    "the orbit is counterclockwise ( direct ) .",
    "the path of  on the plane of the sky as seen by _ hipparcos _ is shown in figure  [ fig : hippath ] .",
    "the contorted pattern results from the combination of annual proper motion ( indicated by the arrow ) , parallactic motion , and orbital motion .",
    "in addition to providing the parallax , the key contribution of the _ hipparcos _ observations regarding the masses of  is that they allow the measurement of the semimajor axis of the photocenter .",
    "this parameter can be expressed in terms of the relative semimajor axis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the mass fraction @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the light fraction @xmath45 .",
    "this can be put in a more convenient form as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath11 is the magnitude difference in the _ hipparcos _ passband ( @xmath48 ) . therefore ,",
    "if the magnitude difference is known , the combination of both kinds of astrometric measurements allows one to solve for the mass ratio @xmath49 .",
    "since the total mass can also be determined from kepler s third law given the parallax ( @xmath50 ) , the individual masses in units of the solar mass follow immediately : @xmath51 in the above expressions all angular quantities are expressed in the same units , and the period is in units of sidereal years .",
    "the interferometric measurement of @xmath11 by @xcite is therefore of crucial importance here , and we have made use of it as an external constraint ( along with its uncertainty ) in order to solve for the masses .",
    "strictly speaking , however , the value entered in the equations above must correspond to the same passband as the _ hipparcos _ observations ( @xmath48 ) , whereas the relevant @xmath11 reported by @xcite corresponds to the passband of one of the spectral channels of the npoi centered at 5500   .",
    "we have assumed that the latter corresponds closely to the visual band , and we have applied a small correction to transform it to the @xmath48 band using the relations by @xcite .",
    "this transformation depends on the individual @xmath52 and @xmath53 colors of the components , which have not been measured directly .",
    "but as described in  [ sec : models ] , they can be estimated using stellar evolution models ( see table  [ tab : colors ] below ) .",
    "the result is then @xmath54 , where the uncertainty includes the contribution from the scatter of the transformation .",
    "the individual masses we obtain for the components of  are reported in table  [ tab : elements ] , along with other quantities derived from the orbital elements , such as the velocity amplitudes ( @xmath23 , @xmath55 ) predicted for the primary and secondary .",
    "the uncertainties in the derived quantities account for the correlations between the various elements .",
    "the total mass is essentially the same as derived by @xcite , but with a significantly reduced error due mostly to the improved parallax .",
    "however , our individual masses are different than the nominal values they inferred , and are much closer to those expected for the spectral types estimated by them ( see below ) .",
    "we emphasize that our mass determinations in this section are purely astrometric , since we have not made any use of the spectroscopy in our fit .",
    "several of the orbital elements are considerably more precise in our solution than in the work of @xcite , including the semimajor axis @xmath26 that in principle depends only on the npoi observations , which are common to both fits .",
    "this is most likely due to two factors : our rejection of one of the npoi observations giving large residuals , and the fact that we did not use the radial - velocity observations of @xcite , which appear to show some inconsistency with the astrometry and may be biasing the solution of @xcite causing larger errors .",
    "we investigate this issue in more detail in the next section .",
    "our error in the period is also smaller despite the shorter time span of the observations considered in our fit ( 15.5 yr ) compared to theirs ( 40.2 ) .",
    "we attribute this to the same reasons .",
    "the orbital solution of @xcite is a combined fit of their npoi data with the radial velocities from @xcite .",
    "although this resulted in orbital elements with significantly smaller errors , they instead elected to use the mass function as computed originally by @xcite , and with their total system mass of 4.7  m@xmath1 they inferred individual masses of 3.6  m@xmath1 for the primary and 1.1  m@xmath1 for the secondary .",
    "they correctly pointed out that these values seem anomalous for the spectral types ( which they estimated as b8v and a8v ) , the primary mass being too large and the secondary too small .",
    "since the secondary mass is proportional to @xmath56 , the two main factors that contribute to the discrepancy appear to be the larger inclination angle of @xcite compared to ours , and the smaller velocity semiamplitude .",
    "given that the difference in the inclination angle is not sufficient to explain the problem , we conclude that the @xmath23 value from @xcite is probably too small .    in figure  [",
    "fig : rvcheck ] we compare the original radial velocities by @xcite with our astrometric solution from the previous section ( indicated with the solid line ) , in which the center - of - mass velocity has been adjusted by eye to fit the velocities .",
    "it is seen that the agreement is very good with the exception of one measurement obtained precisely at the descending node near phase 0.0 , which shows a residual @xmath575 times larger than the scatter of the remaining points .",
    "this measurement happens to carry the highest weight for establishing the semiamplitude @xmath23 , and we speculate that it may be biased and may be pulling the amplitude toward lower values . for reference",
    "we show also the original solution by @xcite ( dotted line ) , in which the amplitude is lower and that measurement does not particularly stand out as an outlier .",
    "a new spectroscopic solution without this observation gives a larger semiamplitude ( @xmath58  ) , as expected , although it is also a bit more uncertain because of the lack of constraint at the maximum .",
    "we note that several of the other elements in this trial solution are also closer to our results in  [ sec : orbit ] , particularly the eccentricity ( @xmath59 ) and the longitude of periastron ( @xmath60 ) , which is suggestive .",
    "a search for other velocities of  in the literature revealed a set of measurements of the primary star obtained by @xcite between 1989 and 1998 that appears to be of good quality , and that was not used in the work of @xcite .",
    "examination of those data  her instead of . ] shows that unfortunately they too lack coverage near the all - important descending node , and in addition there are two outliers , has a velocity of @xmath61  that is much lower than any of the others and is clearly erroneous , while the other , on hjd @xmath62 , has a velocity nearly 1.5  ( @xmath63 3@xmath64 ) higher than three other measurements at a similar phase that show very good interagreement . ] . nevertheless , we believe them to be potentially useful so we have considered them along with those of @xcite in a new combined orbital solution described next .",
    "the velocities of the secondary measured by @xcite , on the other hand , are of insufficient quality to be of use and show very poor agreement with our astrometric solution .",
    "the inclusion of radial velocities in the fit along with the astrometry introduces a redundancy from the fact that the velocity semiamplitude is constrained by both kinds of measurements .",
    "in addition to the 13 adjustable quantities considered previously , we add the center - of - mass velocity ( @xmath65 ) and a velocity offset ( @xmath66 ) to account for a possible difference in the zero points of the two radial velocity data sets . furthermore , since the velocities provide an indirect constraint on @xmath11 through eq.[[eq : eq1 ] ] ( see below ) , we now consider @xmath11 also as an adjustable quantity instead of as a fixed constraint , and the value of the magnitude difference from interferometry ( properly corrected to the @xmath48 passband ) is regarded as a measurement with its corresponding uncertainty . the scale factor for the @xcite internal errors was found to be 1.77 , and the @xcite velocities were assigned uncertainties of 0.47  so that their reduced @xmath39 is near unity .    the results of this 16-parameter global solution are listed in the last column of table  [ tab : elements ] .",
    "the changes compared to the previous fit are generally well within the errors , a sign that the spectroscopic observations we have added are consistent with the astrometry .",
    "the _ rms _",
    "residuals for an observation of unit weight ( npoi @xmath7 and @xmath8 , radial velocities , _ hipparcos _ ) are , respectively , @xmath67  mas , @xmath68 , @xmath69  , @xmath70  , and @xmath71  mas .",
    "the individual _ hipparcos _ measurements and @xmath40 residuals are listed in table  [ tab : hipparcos ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : hipresid]b we show these residuals as a function of orbital phase . the @xmath40 residuals from the original orbital solution by the _ hipparcos _ team are overplotted in the same figure ( open circles ) , and the two distributions are seen to be essentially the same . for reference ,",
    "figure  [ fig : hipresid]a shows the _ hipparcos _ measurements on the same scale _ before _ accounting for orbital motion , i.e. , the abscissa residuals from the standard 5-parameter solution .",
    "the improvement brought about by the orbital fit is obvious .",
    "minor systematics at the level of a few milli - arc seconds remain in the @xmath40 residuals of figure  [ fig : hipresid]b , for example near phase 0.7 , which we believe may be reflecting the limitations of this data set .",
    "the residuals from the npoi observations are quite similar to those reported by @xcite and are not repeated here .",
    "the velocity residuals are given in table  [ tab : aikman ] and table  [ tab : adelman ] , along with the original measurements ; observations that were rejected as described above have their residuals indicated in parentheses .",
    "these data are compared graphically in figure  [ fig : rvorbit ] against the computed velocity curve from our fit . as an interesting test on the indirect constraint provided by the velocities on the magnitude difference through other elements",
    ", we carried out another solution in which the magnitude difference from interferometry is ignored .",
    "this fit gives @xmath72  mag , which is not far from the measured value of @xmath73  mag .",
    "as mentioned earlier the individual masses derived here for the components of  are in good agreement with those expected for the spectral types of the stars .",
    "a more stringent comparison may be made against current stellar evolution models , for example in the mass - luminosity ( or mass - absolute magnitude ) plane .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the stars in the visual band follow from the system magnitude ( @xmath74 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the magnitude difference determined interferometrically ( @xmath75 ) , and our revised parallax ( @xmath76  mas ) , which corresponds to a distance of @xmath77  pc . ignoring extinction",
    "we obtain @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in figure",
    "[ fig : mlr]a we show the measurements against several model isochrones from the yonsei - yale series by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * ) for ages between 100  myr and 400  myr and solar composition .",
    "the agreement is excellent , and we infer an age of @xmath80  myr from this crude comparison .",
    "the assumption of solar composition here is arbitrary , and in fact a number of detailed analyses of the chemical compositon of  in the literature have generally indicated an iron abundance above solar .",
    "for example , the recent study by @xcite gave a value close to [ fe / h ] = + 0.2 .",
    "this , however , refers strictly to the photospheric composition , which is known to be peculiar in and other hgmn stars . in these objects",
    "some of the elements are enhanced by very large factors ( up to @xmath81 ) compared to the sun , presumably due to radiatively - driven diffusion and gravitational settling @xcite .",
    "therefore , the interior composition ( which is the relevant quantity for the comparison with models ) may be inaccessible to the observer in this class of stars , except perhaps through the study of stellar oscillations , should they be detected .",
    "this apparent difficulty has motivated us to turn the argument around and explore the possibility of inferring the metallicity ( as well as the evolutionary age ) from the available observational constraints via a more systematic comparison with the models , as described below .",
    "in addition to the individual masses and absolute visual magnitudes , we have considered as constraints the integrated colors of the system , which are among the easiest quantities to measure accurately . the observed @xmath53 index of  as reported by @xcite is @xmath82 ( mean of 46 individual ground - based measurements ) . on the other hand the _ hipparcos _ catalogue gives the considerably redder value @xmath83 , based on the @xmath84 and @xmath85 measurements from the _ tycho _ experiment onboard the satellite along with a conversion to the johnson system .",
    "these later measurements were superseded by the re - reduction that resulted in the _ tycho-2 _",
    "catalogue @xcite , according to which @xmath86 and @xmath87 . based on these revised values and the conversion to the johnson system described in the _ hipparcos _ catalogue ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vol .  1 , sect .  1.3 )",
    "we obtain @xmath88 .",
    "this is still redder than the ground - based average , although the uncertainty is perhaps more realistic so that the two determinations are now consistent within the errors .",
    "the weighted average , which we adopt in the following , is @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath52 color of  as reported by @xcite is @xmath90 , from the mean of 40 individual ground - based observations .    to compare the six measured properties ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath93 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) against evolutionary models , we computed by interpolation a large grid of yonsei - yale isochrones spanning a wide range of ages ( 50 to 500  myr ) and metallicities ( @xmath94 to + 0.60 in [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "along each isochrone we interpolated the colors and magnitudes of stars in a fine grid of masses over intervals of @xmath951@xmath64 centered on our measured values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "for all combinations of a primary and secondary mass taken from these two intervals we calculated the theoretical integrated colors of the system , and recorded all combinations of the isochrone age and metallicity that yielded simultaneous agreement with the measured individual absolute magnitudes and combined @xmath52 and @xmath53 indices , within their uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ fig : agemet ] displays all consistent models in the age / metallicity plane , where the point size is related to the goodness of fit as measured by the distance @xmath96 between the model and the observations in the six - dimensional parameter space , @xmath97 ^ 2 + \\left[\\delta m_{\\rm b}\\right]^2 + \\left[\\delta m_v^{\\rm a}\\right]^2 + \\left[\\delta m_v^{\\rm b}\\right]^2 + \\\\ & + & \\left[\\delta ( u\\!-\\!b)\\right]^2 + \\left[\\delta ( b\\!-\\!v)\\right]^2   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] age and metallicity are seen to be highly correlated .",
    "the best match with the observations occurs near the middle of the distribution for a composition very near solar ( [ fe / h ] @xmath98 ) and an age of 210  myr .",
    "the individual masses preferred by this model are within 0.4@xmath64 of the measured values , the agreement with the individual absolute magnitudes is virtually perfect , and that with the integrated colors is @xmath570.1@xmath64 . in table",
    "[ tab : colors ] we list the predicted properties from this model along with the measured values . the individual @xmath52 and @xmath53 colors for the components are the ones used in ",
    "[ sec : orbit ] to convert the interferometric magnitude difference @xmath99 into @xmath100 .",
    "the best - fit isochrone is shown in figure  [ fig : mlr]b .",
    "based on this comparison one may conclude that the interior composition of  is not significantly different from solar , which is more or less as expected for a young early - type system such as this .",
    "we point out , however , that this relies on the colors of  being normal and also on the colors predicted by the stellar evolution models being realistic .",
    "theoretical colors are unlikely to be in error by significant amounts , but we do note that there are some indications of anomalies in the spectrophotometry of hgmn stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) of a nature similar to those seen in metallic - line a stars and other chemically peculiar objects , which are thought to be connected with line blanketing , particularly in the bluer spectral regions .",
    "the orbital solutions in  [ sec : orbit ] and  [ sec : neworbit ] provide an interesting illustration of the usefulness of the _ hipparcos _ intermediate data as a valuable complement to other astrometric or spectroscopic observations .",
    "the abscissa residuals from the satellite mission are publicly available for many thousands of binary stars distributed over the entire sky , and although a number of studies have appeared over the past few years that do take advantage of them , this is largely still an underutilized resource . in the case of the hgmn star  the _ hipparcos _ measurements are key to establishing the individual masses of the components , the most fundamental of the stellar properties .",
    "we find good agreement between these masses and the magnitudes and colors of the system and current stellar evolution models , suggesting the bulk composition of the object is near solar . although the faint secondary has now been detected , both interferometrically and spectroscopically , an accurate measurement of its radial velocity over the orbital cycle should help considerably for reducing the mass uncertainties , which are currently at the 8% and 4% level for the primary and secondary , respectively .",

    "the intermediate data provided with the _ hipparcos _ catalog are the `` abscissa residuals '' , @xmath101 , which represent the difference between the satellite measurements ( abscissae ) along great circles and the predicted abscissae computed from the 5 standard astrometric parameters .",
    "the standard parameters are the position of the object ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) at the reference epoch @xmath104 , the proper motion components ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) , and the parallax ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we follow here the notation in the _ hipparcos _ catalog and define @xmath107 and @xmath108 , to include the projection factors .",
    "the goal of incorporating an orbital model into the analysis of the _ hipparcos _ data is to reduce the original abscissa residuals to values below those obtained from the 5-parameter solution by taking into account the orbital motion of the photocenter .",
    "the @xmath39 minimization approach for doing this has been described previously by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others .",
    "we review the procedure here with additional details to facilitate its application in other cases .",

    "these are both provided in the _ hipparcos _ catalog for each observation .",

    "* ) , and the results from both are typically included in all solutions . to be explicit , @xmath121 where each subarray @xmath122 corresponds to a pair of fast / ndac measurements ( f / n ) and is given by @xmath123 in which @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the corresponding uncertainties and @xmath7 is the correlation coefficient .",
    "the partial derivatives @xmath126 for @xmath127 to 5 in equation ( [ eq : chiterm ] ) are given in the _ hipparcos _ catalog along with the abscissa residuals .",
    "the remaining derivatives can be expressed in terms of the partial derivatives of with respect to @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    "the general expressions for these are @xmath131 in which @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the parallactic factors .",
    "only the last term in each of these equations is relevant in our case .",
    "they represent the right ascension and declination components of the orbital motion , and are conveniently expressed as @xmath134 and @xmath135 . here",
    "@xmath136 and @xmath137 are the rectangular coordinates in the unit orbit given by @xmath138 and @xmath139 , with @xmath140 being the eccentric anomaly .",
    "this angle is related to the period and time of periastron passage through kepler s equation , @xmath141 .",
    "the symbols @xmath142 , @xmath42 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 are the classical thiele - innes constants ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which depend only on the orbital elements @xmath22 , @xmath27 , @xmath16 , and @xmath28 , and are given by @xmath145 the negative sign preceding @xmath22 in these equations reflects our use for this particular application of the longitude of periastron for the primary ( @xmath16 ) instead of that of the secondary ( @xmath146 ) , for consistency with the elements of the spectroscopic orbit . the customary form of the thiele - innes constants in solving the relative orbit of a visual binary uses @xmath147 . trivially the two angles differ by 180 .",
    "as described by @xcite , the nature of the orbital solution is such that of the seven derivatives in equation ( [ eq : derivative ] ) the only one that needs to be considered explicitly is the derivative with respect to the semimajor axis , @xmath148 .",
    "the expression for in equation ( [ eq : chiterm ] ) then reduces to @xmath149 the remaining six orbital elements ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath27 , @xmath16 , @xmath28 , and @xmath20 ) do not appear explicitly but are hidden in @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "thus , 12 parameters enter the evaluation of @xmath39 and are to be adjusted to seek its minimum : six are explicit ( @xmath22 and @xmath152 , with @xmath153 ) , and the remaining six are implicit .    at each iteration towards the @xmath39 minimum the array of @xmath40 residuals is properly weighted by accounting for the error of each abscissa residual and the correlation between the fast and ndac measurements , which typically come in pairs .",
    "representing one of such pairs by @xmath154 , it is easy to see using the definition of @xmath122 above that the corresponding @xmath155th term @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 in the @xmath39 sum will be @xmath159~.\\ ] ] if for some reason a measurement for only one consortium is available on a certain date ( i.e. , the observations are not paired for that particular orbit of the _ hipparcos _ satellite ) , the correlation coefficient is zero and the @xmath39 term reduces to @xmath160 or @xmath161 .",
