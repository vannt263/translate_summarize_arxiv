    "most asteroids rotate in the principal , shortest axis mode : their spin axes practically coincide with the directions of the maximum moment of inertia . only 45 out of almost 5500 entries of the lcdb light curve database ( * ? ? ?",
    "* version ) refer to objects that are possible non - principal axis ( npa ) rotators , also known as ` tumblers ' or wobbling objects . with one exception of 253 mathilde ,",
    "tumblers are rather small , with estimated diameters below 20  km , but even in this size range they belong to a minority among about 2000 objects of this size with known rotation periods .",
    "attitude dynamics of asteroids is shaped mainly by gravitational torques ( exerted either systematically by the sun and giant planets , or sporadically during encounters with other bodies ) , collisions , optical and thermal radiation recoil torques , i.e. the yarkovsky - okeefe - radzievskii - paddack ( yorp ) effect , and ",
    "last but not least  by energy dissipation due to inelastic deformations . as far as npa rotation is concerned , collisions and close approaches trigger tumbling @xcite .",
    "small fragments created from collisions of larger objects are also expected to start their lives in a npa rotation state .",
    "the yorp effect also excites wobbling @xcite , whereas ",
    "save for possible resonances  distant bodies gravitation torques are neutral in this respect .",
    "thus , even accounting for observational selection effects mentioned by @xcite , the dissipative damping seems to override other effects in most of cases .",
    "the mechanism of wobble damping was first identified by @xcite . in npa rotation",
    ", the centrifugal acceleration oscillates periodically , deforming each body fragment .",
    "the deformation is not perfectly elastic , so some fraction of fluctuating strain - stress energy is dissipated during each precession period and converted into heat . draining the elastic energy",
    "affects the kinetic energy of rotation which also decreases .",
    "thus the rotation axis is driven towards the minimum energy state ",
    "rotation around the principal axis of maximum inertia . the angular momentum , however , is not affected by the energy dissipation , as far as we ignore thermal radiation and consider the body as an isolated system .",
    "prendergast provided a general form of energy dissipation rate equation for an oblate spheroid based upon the solution of 3d elasticity equations and the assumption that a constant fraction of the oscillating part of elastic energy is dissipated at each precession period .",
    "the latter assumption defines the now commonly adopted ` @xmath9-model ' .",
    "@xcite built upon the general idea of prendergast using combination of a spheroidal shape for rotation and a bent slender beam approximation for elastic energy .",
    "their simple estimate of spin axis alignment time is still in use  sometimes in the version provided by @xcite .",
    "however , some scepticism towards it has been brought by observations of asteroids that do rotate around the principal axis in spite of having burns - safronov damping time estimate longer than the age of the solar system",
    ". meanwhile , the problem migrated to geophysics ( e.g. chandler wobble damping ) , rotation dynamics of comets and interstellar dust grains physics .",
    "the last branch , stemming from @xcite , was finally brought back to the dynamics of comets and asteroids with the sequence of papers by efroimsky and lazarian @xcite .",
    "their main point of novelty is the attempt to discuss a triaxial object , represented by a rectangular prism ( brick ) , by solving the complete , quasi - static stress tensor equation @xcite .",
    "later on , @xcite issued the damping model for a spheroid using the same starting point as @xcite , i.e. solving equations for displacements . the work of @xcite not only provides the solution for a spheroid with two different ways of estimating the peak elastic energy required for the @xmath9-model , but it also offers a long discussion of shortcomings and problems related with earlier papers mentioned in this paragraph .",
    "trying to combine the yorp effect with a damping mechanism , we first intended to use the spheroid based model of @xcite for arbitrary shape asteroids .",
    "this approach , mentioned in @xcite , became less appealing after a closer inspection , because of substantial difference in the dynamics of bodies with and without axial symmetry .",
    "on the other hand , the solution of @xcite , albeit referring to a triaxial shape , exhibits a number of drawbacks :    1 .   as a consequence of using a non - smooth , brick - shaped object ,",
    "the solution of stress equations is inexact , with unknown error bounds . 2 .",
    "compatibility conditions are not fulfilled , i.e. there is no displacements field that might produce the strain tensor found by efroimsky @xcite .",
    "rotation dynamics is treated by approximate formulae valid only in the neighborhood of principal axis .",
    "later on , @xcite suggested fourier series involving the jacobi nome as a remedy for the last item , but none of subsequent works has implemented this guideline . in these circumstances , we have decided to resume the problem at the point where efroimsky has abandoned it , not only using fourier series to resolve the last problem , but also applying the triaxial ellipsoid shape which resolves the first two objections as well . from this point of view",
    ", the present work combines a stress solution in the style of @xcite with energy dissipation treatment in the spirit of @xcite .    in section  [ sec:2 ] we first formulate the problem of determining the stress tensor and enumerate the assumptions , hoping to help a reader less familiar with elasticity problems .",
    "basic facts are recalled according the textbooks of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "two independent methods ( displacements approach and stress approach ) are used to derive and cross - check the final expressions of the stress tensor .",
    "the @xmath9-model of energy dissipation is introduced in section  [ sec:3 ] and applied in section  [ sec:4 ] to derive an energy dissipation rate formula .",
    "section  [ sec:5 ] presents wobble damping time equations based upon the results of section  [ sec:4 ] and some exemplary results . in section  [ sec:6 ]",
    "we present the reduction to a specific case of a spheroid where a comparison of our solution with those reported in earlier works is possible .",
    "we use this opportunity to resolve controversies concerning drastically different energy dissipation rates in various models .",
    "in an arbitrary reference frame , we consider a body as a dense union of material points .",
    "let the set of position vectors @xmath10 define a reference state ( configuration ) ; if the points , for any reason , move with respect to the reference state , their position vectors will be incremented by displacement vectors @xmath11 , dependent on time @xmath12 as well as on position @xmath10 , creating a new state with @xmath13 the notion of displacements is too general , because it may include rigid body motion  translation and rotation of the entire body .",
    "the rigid body motions are discarded by the introduction of the strain @xmath14  the dimensionless , tensor quantity describing deformations of an infinitesimal volume element in terms of displacements gradient .",
    "the gradient of displacements is small and its square can be neglected .    under the above assumption ,",
    "strain tensor @xmath14 is symmetric by its definition @xmath15,\\ ] ] where the derivatives are taken with respect to the components of @xmath10 .",
    "two kinds of forces have to be considered in a continuous medium : volumetric forces and surface forces , known also as body forces and tractions , respectively .",
    "body forces represent ` external ' force field . in our case",
    "they include self - gravitation and forces of inertia .",
    "they are defined as a vector field and specified in terms of their volumetric density @xmath16  force divided by the mass of the volume element , so the total volumetric force @xmath17 acting on a body with density @xmath18 is the result of volume integral @xmath19 surface traction @xmath20 is a vector of the force acting on an infinitesimal oriented surface , divided by the area .",
    "it describes interactions between adjacent volume elements or forces applied directly on the boundary .",
    "the surface is defined by its unit normal vector @xmath21 , and may lie either on a boundary or inside the body . in order to describe traction at each possible direction of a plane passing through the point @xmath10",
    ", each component vector of @xmath20 in a given basis is projected on each component vector of @xmath21 , creating the cauchy stress tensor @xmath22 .",
    "thus , traction on a surface defined by @xmath21 can be obtained from @xmath22 as ( unless explicitly stated , repeated index summation assumed in all formulae ) @xmath23 the units of stress tensor components are those of force per area .",
    "a good illustration of the two forces nature is a glass of water : body force density is constant throughout the volume ( homogenous gravitational field ) , whereas tractions define a hydrostatic pressure  vanishing on the top surface , reaching maximum at the bottom and depending , as a vector , on the direction of the surface element .    : the deformable body forms an isolated system without internal heat sources .",
    "the consequences of this assumption are numerous .",
    "first of all , we can use the linear momentum conservation principle in the form of cauchy equation , linking stress tensor , body forces and the acceleration of mass particles in an inertial reference frame @xmath24 if the reference configuration is not fixed in space and still we want it to define the reference frame for cauchy equation , then @xmath25 should be transferred to the body forces @xmath26 ( subtracted ) as the density of forces of inertia . in case of rotation , some corolis type terms involving @xmath27 may also appear in the right - hand side @xcite .",
    ": quasistatic approximation .",
    "quasistatic approximation results from setting @xmath28 ( and any coriolis type @xmath27 ) in the right hand sides of ( [ dyn ] ) .",
    "this simplification was generally adopted since @xcite and we proceed similarly in the present work . having included forces of inertia in @xmath26 , so that @xmath29 , we solve a static equilibrium equation for @xmath22 @xmath30 although body forces can be time dependent . the validity of equation  ( [ qss ] )",
    "can be justified if the solution of the original cauchy equation is a sum of ` free ' acoustic waves of high frequency and forced vibrations whose frequencies  presumably much lower  come from @xmath26 .",
    "free vibrations can be neglected from two points of view : either we consider them to have zero amplitudes at some initial moment and then a slow , adiabatic forcing will not excite them considerably , or ",
    "looking forward to the introduction of some dissipation mechanism  the high frequency terms will be quickly damped . in both cases the stationary regime oscillations derived from ( [ qss ] ) will have amplitudes that differ from the actual ones by a small quantity comparable with the ratio of free to forced vibrations periods",
    ".    traction - free surface .",
    "boundary conditions for the stress tensor will be specified as homogenous neumann conditions on the surface of a deformable body @xmath31 the uniqueness of @xmath22 as a solution of this boundary problem is guaranteed by general theorems @xcite , but it is not seen immediately from three scalar equations of ( [ bound ] ) , even if we add an additional property : according to assumption 2 , the angular momentum is conserved , so the stress tensor should be symmetric , i.e. @xmath32 . at this point , @xcite felt free to postulate @xmath33 , which was harshly criticized by @xcite .",
    "hookean constitutive relations .",
    "let us assume that an asteroid is made of a linear , isotropic elastic material with adiabatic lam shear modulus @xmath34 and the poisson ratio @xmath35 describing the compressibility ( incompressible materials have the maximum possible @xmath36 ) . with these assumptions , the hooke s law  serving as a constitutive equation  states a linear relation between the strain and stress @xmath37 or , conversely , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the kronecker delta .      our first goal is to find the symmetric stress tensor @xmath22 as a solution of equations ( [ qss ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ bound ] ) . in the stress approach ,",
    "the problem is solved directly , by assuming some ansatz on @xmath22 as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "but if we accept assumption 5 , additional conditions have to be imposed .",
    "strain is a mathematically meaningful quantity if there exists a displacement field that generates it through equation  ( [ epsdef ] ) . even without explicit knowledge of @xmath40 ,",
    "this is guaranteed by saint venant s compatibility conditions @xcite @xmath41 providing 6 independent relations between @xmath42 . through the constitutive relations ( [ hooke ] )",
    ", compatibility equations provide the identities that a meaningful stress tensor has to obey in addition to boundary conditions . in next section",
    "we show that ( [ bound ] ) and ( [ compa ] ) together admit a unique solution for @xmath22 .",
    "the stress approach was applied by @xcite to the problem of a rotating rectangular prism .",
    "yet , the postulated form of @xmath22 satisfied only the cauchy equation ( [ qss ] ) ; neither boundary conditions , nor compatibility equations could be satisfied exactly ( the latter were not tested at all ) and the level of resulting error remains unknown @xcite .    another way of solving cauchy equation is the displacements approach . using equations  ( [ epsdef ] ) and ( [ hooke ] ) ,",
    "we convert the first order differential equation for stress tensor ( [ qss ] ) into a second degree equation for displacements vector field @xmath40 , obtaining the quasistatic lam or cauchy - navier equation @xmath43 = - \\rho \\ , { \\bmath{b}},\\ ] ] with boundary conditions @xmath44\\,{\\bmath{n } } = { \\bmath{0}},\\ ] ] derived from ( [ bound ] ) . equations ( [ nav ] ) with only three neumann boundary conditions ( [ b : nav ] ) admit a solution @xmath11 which is not unique and an arbitrary rigid motion may be added to displacements .",
    "but since the definition of @xmath14 involves differentiation , the resulting strain and stress tensors are uniquely defined regardless of remaining arbitrary terms . following",
    "@xcite we will impose two special conditions : the volume integral of the displacements field should vanish @xmath45 and the moment of displacements should also vanish , i.e. @xmath46 these six conditions aim at suppressing rigid translation and rotation terms in displacements and allow a unique determination of @xmath40 , which is of minor interest for the stress tensor recovered through ( [ epsdef ] ) and ( [ hooke ] ) , but gives more insight into the question of the reference configuration choice and simplify energy and momentum balance discussion .",
    "up to the ambiguity in the last two conditions , the displacements approach was taken by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we can also observe that restoring the term @xmath47 in equation  ( [ nav ] ) , we obtain a quantitative measure of quasistatic approximation error .",
    "the homogenous solution will involve a frequency close to @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the radius of an object .",
    "if body forces are periodic with frequency @xmath50 ( the precession frequency in our case ) then , with @xmath34 of the order of @xmath51 , the ratio @xmath52 may be safely considered small .",
    "let the reference configuration be a homogeneous rigid ellipsoid with semiaxes @xmath53 .",
    "its shape will be described by two dimensionless parameters @xmath54 both taking values @xmath55 . in the reference frame",
    "whose centre coincides with the centre of mass and the basis vectors @xmath56 are directed along the principal axes , the parametric equation of the interior reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the boundary is specified by @xmath61 and the unit normal vector on the boundary is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is some nonzero function ; its explicit definition is not required for the vanishing traction condition ( [ bound ] ) . according to the postulate ( [ com : inv ] )",
    ", the centre of ellipsoid remains the centre of mass even in a deformed state .",
    "given an arbitrary function @xmath64 , the volume integration rule for an ellipsoid is @xmath65 where @xmath64 should be expressed in terms of @xmath66 according to equation  ( [ par : eli ] ) .",
    "the body forces acting on a freely rotating ellipsoid include the forces of inertia due to rotation , with force density vector @xmath67 where the time derivative of rotation vector @xmath68 is given by euler equations @xmath69 and the moments of inertia @xmath70 for an ellipsoid with mass @xmath71 @xmath72 are substituted .",
    "gravitation inside the ellipsoid results in body forces density @xmath73 with constants @xmath74 expressed in terms of gravitation constant @xmath75 and carlson s elliptic integral @xmath76    the body forces are linear in coordinates of reference configuration , so we write them as @xmath77 with coordinates independent matrix @xmath78 having elements @xmath79 and @xmath80      displacements and their partial derivatives are small quantities of the first order",
    ".    this stronger variant of assumption 1 allows to treat the problem in terms of a first order approximation .",
    "namely , considering boundary conditions we can impose them on the reference ellipsoid surface , neglecting the displacements that deform it .",
    "it also means we do not restrict reference ellipsoids to a figure of equilibrium type solutions like e.g. jacobi ellipsoids @xcite . in the same spirit , we ignore the variations of density due to strain and use a constant , mean @xmath81 whenever it serves to define displacements or stress  either explicitly , or indirectly ( like in body forces @xmath82 ) .",
    "it turns out that postulates ( [ com : inv ] ) and ( [ mom : inv ] ) are inherently related with the choice of reference configuration that satisfies our assumption . in the first approximation ,",
    "i.e. evaluating volume integrals over the homogeneous reference ellipsoid , we interpret ( [ com : inv ] ) as a postulate that the centre of mass position is not altered by displacements .",
    "similarly , equation  ( [ mom : inv ] ) indirectly leads to the statement , that displacements velocities do not contribute to the angular momentum of the system . observing that @xmath27 will depend on @xmath83 in exactly the same form as @xmath40 depends on @xmath84 ( the cauchy - navier equation is linear and does not involve time derivative ) ,",
    "we find @xmath85 as a consequence of ( [ mom : inv ] ) , provided @xmath81 is constant and the same bounding surface is used in both integrals , i.e. within the first order approximation . in other words ,",
    "the postulate ( [ mom : inv ] ) implies that we use tisserand s mean axes @xcite as the reference frame and they approximately coincide with the principal axes of the reference ellipsoid .",
    "such choice has a property of minimizing the displacements and their velocities .",
    "@xcite postulated a pre - stressed state of their reference spheroid and dropped the constant part of the stress due to self - gravitation on the onset of their derivation .",
    "they were not consequent in this point , because they did not do the same with a mean part of centrifugal stress .",
    "for typical asteroids both effects may be comparable .",
    "they may even mutually cancel .",
    "thus we do not find the pre - stressed state assumption necessary for asteroids , although it is important for major objects , like the earth , where it was originally introduced @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", its role would be to provide the rationale for the validity of the six assumptions we have already made .",
    "the problem of finding displacements and stress tensor for a freely rotating ellipsoid ( without self - gravitation ) was solved by @xcite .",
    "their impressive solution , apparently worked out without the support of computer algebra , was based upon the displacements approach , which helped in establishing the influence of displacements field on the moments of inertia .",
    "earlier results of @xcite included the self - gravitation , but only the principal axis rotation was considered .",
    "we used the stress tensor of @xcite as a test of our solution .",
    "the main advantage of using an ellipsoid is the possibility of finding the displacements field that satisfies equations  ( [ nav ] ) , ( [ b : nav ] ) and ( [ bfm ] ) as a sum of two homogeneous polynomials of degrees 1 and 3 i.e. a sum of 13 monomials with dimensionless vector coefficients @xmath86 @xmath87 which involves 39 arbitrary constants : 9 for the linear part and 30 for the cubic terms .",
    "it is instructive to add @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 as additional , unspecified parameters , raising the number of unknowns to 42 .",
    "our choice for the form of @xmath40 is straightforward , although not necessarily optimal ; for example , @xcite used the spherical harmonics basis and reported a smaller number of undetermined coefficients for a spheroid and in an unpublished solution for the ellipsoid ( sharma , private communication ) .    using the ` brute force ' attack , allowed by the use of an algebraic manipulator , we formulate 42 independent conditions involving linearly the coefficients of @xmath40 and unspecified elements @xmath84 of matrix @xmath78  the ones with @xmath91 are parameters , and those with @xmath92 are unknowns .",
    "first , we observe that the centre of mass condition ( [ com : inv ] ) is satisfied identically by ( [ uh : def ] ) .",
    "actually , it has been used implicitly to drop coordinate independent and quadratic parts of @xmath40 .",
    "1 .   equation ( [ nav ] ) generates three equations linear in @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "this amounts to 9 equations linking each @xmath84 with 5 coefficients of the cubic part of @xmath40 .",
    "postulating equation  ( [ mom : inv ] ) , we obtain 3 equations  each linking two coefficients of the linear and six of the cubic part of @xmath40 .",
    "the remaining 30 equations result from boundary conditions ( [ b : nav ] ) . they can be derived either directly , i.e. from the polynomial form of ellipsoid surface and normal vector @xcite , or by considering trigonometric polynomials of @xmath96 and @xmath97 resulting from the substitution of equations  ( [ par : eli ] ) and ( [ norv ] ) . in the latter case",
    ", we first equate to 0 the coefficients of @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 which have a common factor @xmath102 or @xmath103 ; this provides 12 conditions .",
    "then , in the coefficients of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , we separate the terms with @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and set them to 0 , obtaining another 12 conditions .",
    "finally , in the part independent on @xmath96 we separate terms factored by @xmath108 and @xmath109 resulting in the last 6 conditions .    solving the cramer system of 42 linear equations",
    "we obtain a unique solution for the 39 coefficients of @xmath40 as linear combinations of @xmath110 with @xmath91 . for the remaining three unknowns we recover equation  ( [ lower ] ) which becomes the condition of existence of the displacements solution ( [ uh : def ] ) for an ellipsoid",
    " slightly more general than the condition found by @xcite .    unfortunately , the resulting expressions of displacements field @xmath40 are too long to be quoted .",
    "each @xmath84 appearing in @xmath86 has its own multiplier  a rational function of @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath35 .",
    "the only common factor of all @xmath86 vectors is @xmath113 .",
    "this indicates a link between assumptions 3 and 6 .",
    "the structure of displacements field is inherited by the stress and strain tensors .",
    "each @xmath114 and @xmath42 is a linear combination of @xmath84 , including zero and second degree monomials of @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "we focus the discussion on the stress tensor , because @xmath22 can be of interest in studying the breakup of spinning asteroids ( e.g. @xcite ) , whereas strain components @xmath42 in the elastic material are easily found from @xmath22 using constitutive relations ( [ hooki ] ) .    introducing @xmath115 to benefit from some symmetries ,",
    "we can write the general form of @xmath22 for the elastic ellipsoid as @xmath116 where @xmath117 represents the stress tensor at the origin @xmath118 , and all matrices are symmetric .",
    "thus the stress definition requires 42 matrix elements to be determined .",
    "their expressions resulting from direct substitution of displacements solution are unwieldy , so we decided to apply the second possible way of determining @xmath22  the stress approach .",
    "quasistatic equilibrium condition ( [ qss ] ) does not involve @xmath119 and leads to 9 linear relations between @xmath120 and body force matrix @xmath78 .",
    "boundary conditions ( [ bound ] ) generate 30 relations between the elements of @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "however , the resulting set of 39 linear equations admits solutions only if conditions ( [ lower ] ) are satisfied and then its rank drops to 36 allowing a unique solution for all @xmath120 as linear combinations of @xmath119 and @xmath78 elements .",

    "extended constitutive relations are formulated either as differential equations , involving @xmath147 and/or @xmath148 , or in terms of integrals of creep and relaxation functions .",
    "this leads to the occurrence of a time lag between forced oscillations of strain and stress . in this respect ,",
    "the situation becomes similar to a periodically driven harmonic oscillator with damping : due to a lag between velocity and position , the time derivative of potential energy integrated over a forcing cycle does not vanish and generates a power deficit credited by the external forcing in order to sustain stationary oscillations . in the case of our study ,",
    "the power supply comes from the kinetic energy @xmath149 and is not unlimited .",
    "moreover , a coupling exists between the power supply and demand , because the amplitude of stationary vibrations depends on the excess of kinetic energy over the ground state of @xmath150 .      introducing the quality factor @xmath9 as an empirical parameter , one may , in principle , discuss the energy dissipation in vibrating inelastic materials without any explicit knowledge of their constitutive relations . in practice , however , the problem of unknown rheology leaks into the question of a proper definition of @xmath9 and of its dependence on driving frequency , temperature , etc . @xcite . in the limit , a perfect definition of @xmath9 is probably not easier than defining an adequate rheological model and solving the related inelastic oscillations problem .",
    "@xcite tried to put some order into a growing number of different @xmath9 definitions .",
    "they warned about ` confusion between some ill - defined @xmath9 of a process ' and ` an intrinsic @xmath9 of the material ' . their generally acclaimed definition of quality factor",

    "they proposed an alternative approach including the effect of the average @xmath155 .",
    "when starting the present work , we did share the doubts of @xcite and were attracted by the alternative way of estimating the fluctuating energy amount .",

    ", we feel obliged to observe that for any @xmath305 , numerical values of shape factors and damping times published and plotted in ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) differ from the ones resulting from his energy dissipation formulae by a constant factor @xmath371 .",
    "we have found no trace of this discrepancy in the published equations , so the difference , most likely , should be attributed to a purely computational error . together with the incompatible definition of quality factor @xmath9 , it means that all damping times from @xcite should be divided by @xmath372 , so they are no longer to be considered unusually high . on the other hand , damping times shorter than burns - safronov estimates claimed by @xcite result partially ( factor @xmath373 ) from using an object ( a prism ) with a higher volume than any solid of revolution with the same ratio of axes .",
    "using the ensemble of standard assumptions , we have derived the stress tensor inside a freely rotating and self - gravitating ellipsoid .",
    "writing about known solutions to this problem , @xcite put meaningful quotation marks around the word _",
    "available_. our present solution , given in the appendix  [ ap : a ] has a form which is probably compact enough to suppress the marks , especially for the principal axis rotation .",
    "interestingly , the presented form of @xmath22 does not involve singularity at the incompressible limit @xmath374 , where @xcite had to use @xmath375 .",
    "the stress tensor has served us as the basis for the energy dissipation model built along the lines that @xcite proposed , but left unaccomplished . however , the use of an ellipsoid instead of an efroimsky - lazarian rectangular prism permitted to avoid all objections related with partially satisfied boundary conditions and/or missing compatibility conditions .",
    "we have also found no reasons to impose superficial conditions of a stress - free boundary like @xcite .",
    "the solution hinges upon the use of @xmath376 series the jacobi nome @xmath377 .",
    "their convergence is very good and even taking @xmath378 in equations ( [ p:1]-[p:4 ] ) , guarantees at least three significant digits in the area under @xmath322 for @xmath379 . of course , the series are not legitimate exactly at @xmath380 ( i.e @xmath271 ) .",
    "an in - depth discussion of this limit was given by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , this state is not to be considered seriously , since any additional torque will trigger the emergence of a chaotic zone in the vicinity of separatrices .",
    "in contrast to the results of @xcite , we find that the role of compressibility in the energy dissipation process is marginal in the range of poisson s ratio @xmath381 .",
    "apparently , the stronger dependence obtained by @xcite for a spheroid resulted from too strong boundary conditions .",
    "investigating the spheroid as a particular case of our model , we have succeeded to resolve a major part of controversies concerning short damping times of @xcite and very long ones according to @xcite . in our opinion ,",
    "the excess of energy dissipation rate over mainstream models is mostly due to a higher volume of the body shape assumed by @xcite .",
    "the shape factors reported by @xcite are overestimated mostly by an incompatible quality factor definition , a spurious factor @xmath371 in their computations , and a missing second mode multiplier .",
    "we find the objections against boundary conditions used or compatibility conditions violation , raised by @xcite or @xcite , formally justified , yet we note that they affect the accuracy of the damping / excitation times by at most @xmath382 .",
