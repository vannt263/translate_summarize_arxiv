    "as in classical general relativity we start our discussion in flat spacevelocity which will then be generalized to curved space .    the flat - spacevelocity cosmological",
    "metric is given by @xmath5 here @xmath6 is hubble s time , the inverse of hubble s constant , as given by measurements in the limit of zero distances and thus zero gravity .",
    "as such , @xmath6 is a constant , in fact a universal constant ( its numerical value is given in section 8 , @xmath7gyr ) .",
    "its role in cosmology theory resembles that of @xmath8 , the speed of light in vacuum , in ordinary special relativity .",
    "the velocity @xmath9 is used here in the sense of cosmology , as in hubble s law , and is usually not the time - derivative of the distance .",
    "the universe expansion is obtained from the metric ( 1 ) as a null condition , @xmath10 .",
    "using spherical coordinates @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 for the metric ( 1 ) , and the fact that the universe is spherically symmetric ( @xmath14 ) , the null condition then yields @xmath15 , or upon integration and using appropriate initial conditions , gives @xmath16 or @xmath17 , i.e. the hubble law in the zero - gravity limit .",
    "based on the metric ( 1 ) a cosmological special relativity ( csr ) was presented in the text [ 1 ] ( see chapter 2 ) . in this theory",
    "the receding velocities of galaxies and the distances between them in the hubble expansion are united into a four - dimensional pseudo - euclidean manifold , similarly to space and time in ordinary special relativity .",
    "the hubble law is assumed and is written in an invariant way that enables one to derive a four - dimensional transformation which is similar to the lorentz transformation .",
    "the parameter in the new transformation is the ratio between the cosmic time to @xmath6 ( in which the cosmic time is measured backward with respect to the present time ) .",
    "accordingly , the new transformation relates physical quantities at different cosmic times in the limit of weak or negligible gravitation .    the transformation between the four variables @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath9 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( assuming @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) is given by @xmath27 equations ( 2 ) are the _ cosmological transformation _ and very much resemble the well - known lorentz transformation . in csr it is the relative cosmic time which takes the role of the relative velocity in einstein s special relativity .",
    "the transformation ( 2 ) leaves invariant the hubble time @xmath6 , just as the lorentz transformation leaves invariant the speed of light in vacuum @xmath8 .",
    "a cosmological general theory of relativity , suitable for the large - scale structure of the universe , was subsequently developed [ 2 - 5 ] . in the framework of cosmological general relativity ( cgr )",
    "gravitation is described by a curved four - dimensional riemannian spacevelocity .",
    "cgr incorporates the hubble constant @xmath6 at the outset .",
    "the hubble law is assumed in cgr as a fundamental law .",
    "cgr , in essence , extends hubble s law so as to incorporate gravitation in it ; it is actually a _ distribution theory _ that relates distances and velocities between galaxies .",
    "the theory involves only measured quantities and it takes a picture of the universe as it is at any moment .",
    "the following is a brief review of cgr as was originally given by the author in 1996 in ref .",
    "the foundations of any gravitational theory are based on the principle of equivalence and the principle of general covariance [ 6 ] .",
    "these two principles lead immediately to the realization that gravitation should be described by a four - dimensional curved spacetime , in our theory spacevelocity , and that the field equations and the equations of motion should be written in a generally covariant form .",
    "hence these principles were adopted in cgr also .",
    "use is made in a four - dimensional riemannian manifold with a metric @xmath28 and a line element @xmath29 .",
    "the difference from einstein s general relativity is that our coordinates are : @xmath30 is a velocitylike coordinate ( rather than a timelike coordinate ) , thus @xmath31 where @xmath6 is the hubble time in the zero - gravity limit and @xmath9 the velocity .",
    "the coordinate @xmath31 is the comparable to @xmath32 where @xmath8 is the speed of light and @xmath33 is the time in ordinary general relativity .",
    "the other three coordinates @xmath34 , @xmath35 , are spacelike , just as in general relativity theory .",
    "an immediate consequence of the above choice of coordinates is that the null condition @xmath10 describes the expansion of the universe in the curved spacevelocity ( generalized hubble s law with gravitation ) as compared to the propagation of light in the curved spacetime in general relativity .",
    "this means one solves the field equations ( to be given in the sequel ) for the metric tensor , then from the null condition @xmath10 one obtains immedialety the dependence of the relative distances between the galaxies on their relative velocities .    as usual in gravitational theories , one equates geometry to physics .",
    "the first is expressed by means of a combination of the ricci tensor and the ricci scalar , and follows to be naturally either the ricci trace - free tensor or the einstein tensor .",
    "the ricci trace - free tensor does not fit gravitation in general , and the einstein tensor is a natural candidate .",
    "the physical part is expressed by the energy - momentum tensor which now has a different physical meaning from that in einstein s theory .",
    "more important , the coupling constant that relates geometry to physics is now also _",
    "different_.    accordingly the field equations are @xmath36 exactly as in einstein s theory , with @xmath37 given by @xmath38 , ( in general relativity it is given by @xmath39 ) , where @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 , with @xmath42 being newton s gravitational constant , and @xmath6 the hubble constant time .",
    "when the equations of motion will be written in terms of velocity instead of time , the constant @xmath40 will replace @xmath42 . using the above equations one then has @xmath43 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath44 is constructed , along the lines of general relativity theory , with the speed of light being replaced by the hubble constant time .",
    "if @xmath45 is the average mass density of the universe , then it will be assumed that @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the four - velocity . in general relativity theory",
    "one takes @xmath48 . in newtonian gravity",
    "one has the poisson equation @xmath49 . at points",
    "where @xmath50 one solves the vacuum einstein field equations in general relativity and the laplace equation @xmath51 in newtonian gravity . in both theories",
    "a null ( zero ) solution is allowed as a trivial case . in cosmology",
    ", however , there exists no situation at which @xmath45 can be zero because the universe is filled with matter . in order to be able to have zero on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 3 ) one takes @xmath52 not as equal to @xmath45 , but to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the critical mass density , a _",
    "constant _ in cgr given by @xmath55 , whose value is @xmath56 , a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter .",
    "accordingly one takes @xmath57 for the energy - momentum tensor .    in the next sections we apply cgr to obtain the accelerating expanding universe and related subjects",
    "in the four - dimensional spacevelocity the spherically symmetric metric is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are functions of @xmath9 and @xmath11 alone , and comoving coordinates @xmath61 have been used . with the above choice of coordinates , the zero - component of the geodesic equation becomes an identity , and since @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constants along the geodesics , one has @xmath62 and therefore @xmath63 the metric ( 5 ) shows that the area of the sphere @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 and that @xmath60 should satisfy @xmath66 .",
    "the possibility that @xmath67 at a point @xmath68 is excluded since it would allow the lines @xmath69 at the neighboring points @xmath68 and @xmath70 to coincide at @xmath68 , thus creating a caustic surface at which the comoving coordinates break down .    as has been shown in the previous sections the universe expands by the null condition @xmath10 , and",
    "if the expansion is spherically symmetric one has @xmath71 .",
    "the metric ( 5 ) then yields @xmath72 thus @xmath73 this is the differential equation that determines the universe expansion . in the following",
    "we solve the gravitational field equations in order to find out the function @xmath74 .",
    "the gravitational field equations ( 3 ) , written in the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 with @xmath53 and @xmath77 , are now solved .",
    "( 6 ) one finds that the only nonvanishing components of @xmath78 are @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and that @xmath83 .",
    "the only nonvanishing components of the ricci tensor yield ( dots and primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath9 and @xmath11 , respectively ) , using eq .",
    "( 9 ) , the following field equations : @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90    the field equations obtained for the components 00 , 01 , 11 , and 22 ( the 33 component contributes no new information ) are given by @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94\\ ] ] @xmath95 it is convenient to eliminate the term with the second velocity - derivative of @xmath59 from the above equations",

    "the solution of eq . ( 17 ) satisfying the condition @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is an arbitrary function of the coordinate @xmath11 and satisfies the condition @xmath103 .",
    "substituting ( 19 ) in the other two field equations ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) then gives @xmath104 @xmath105 respectively .",
    "the simplest solution of the above two equations , which satisfies the condition @xmath106 , is given by @xmath107 using eq .",
    "( 22 ) in eqs . ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) gives @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( 24 ) is the sum of the solutions of the homogeneous equation @xmath110 and a particular solution of eq .",
    "these are given by @xmath111 and @xmath112    the solution @xmath113 represents a particle at the origin of coordinates and as such is not relevant to our problem .",
    "we take , accordingly , @xmath114 as the general solution , @xmath115 @xmath116 using the values of @xmath43 and @xmath55 , we obtain @xmath117 where @xmath118 .    the two solutions given by eqs .",
    "( 23 ) and ( 29 ) for @xmath119 can now be equated , giving @xmath120 furthermore , from eqs .",
    "( 19 ) and ( 22 ) we find that @xmath121    it will be recalled that the universe expansion is determined by eq .",
    "( 8) , @xmath122 .",
    "the only thing that is left to be determined is the signs of @xmath123 or the pressure @xmath124 .",
    "thus we have @xmath125 for simplicity we confine ourselves to the linear approximation , thus eq . ( 32 ) yields @xmath126.\\eqno(33)\\ ] ]",
    "the second term in the square bracket in the above equation represents the deviation due to gravity from the standard hubble law . for without that term , eq .",
    "( 33 ) reduces to @xmath15 , thus @xmath127 . the constant can be taken zero if one assumes , as usual , that at @xmath128 the velocity should also vanish .",
    "thus @xmath16 , or @xmath17 ( since @xmath129 ) .",
    "accordingly , the equation of motion ( 33 ) describes the expansion of the universe when @xmath130 , namely when @xmath131 .",
    "the equation then coincides with the standard hubble law .",
    "the equation of motion ( 33 ) can easily be integrated exactly by the substitions @xmath132 @xmath133 one then obtains , using eqs .",
    "( 33 ) and ( 34 ) , @xmath134 @xmath135    we give below the exact solutions for the expansion of the universe for each of the cases , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "( 35a ) we have @xmath139 where @xmath140 , and @xmath141 .",
    "a simple calculation gives [ 7 ] @xmath142 a straightforward calculation then gives @xmath143 as is seen , when @xmath144 then @xmath145 and using the lhospital lemma , @xmath146 as @xmath147 ( and thus @xmath138 ) .",
    "* the case @xmath137 .",

    "we obtain @xmath156 and thus @xmath157 a straightforward calculation then gives @xmath158 as for the case @xmath136 one finds that @xmath145 when @xmath159 , and again , using lhospital lemma , @xmath16 when @xmath160 ( and thus @xmath138 ) .",
    "to see the physical meaning of these solutions , however , one does not need the exact solutions .",
    "rather , it is enough to write down the solutions in the lowest approximation in @xmath161 .",
    "one obtains , by differentiating eq .",
    "( 33 ) with respect to @xmath9 , for @xmath136 , @xmath162 the solution of which is @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 and @xmath166 are constants .",
    "the latter can be determined by the initial condition @xmath167 and @xmath168 , thus @xmath169 this is obviously a closed universe , and presents a decelerating expansion .",
    "for @xmath137 we have @xmath170 whose solution , using the same initial conditions , is @xmath171 where @xmath172 .",
    "this is now an open accelerating universe .    for @xmath130",
    "we have , of course , @xmath16 .",
    "we finally determine which of the three cases of expansion is the one at present epoch of time . to this end",

    "it follows that the measured value of @xmath182 depends on the  short \" and  long \" distance scales [ 8 ] .",
    "the farther the distance @xmath182 is being measured , the lower the value for @xmath182 is obtained . by eq .",
    "( 55 ) this is possible only when @xmath137 , namely when the universe is accelerating . by eq .",
    "( 30 ) we also find that the pressure is positive .",
    "the possibility that the universe expansion is accelerating was first predicted using cgr by the author in 1996 [ 2 ] before the supernovae experiments results became known .",
    "it will be noted that the constant expansion is just a transition stage between the decelerating and the accelerating expansions as the universe evolves toward its present situation .",
    "figure 1 describes the hubble diagram of the above solutions for the three types of expansion for values of @xmath184 from 100 to 0.245 .",
    "the figure describes the three - phase evolution of the universe .",
    "curves ( 1)-(5 ) represent the stages of _ decelerating expansion _ according to eq .",
    "as the density of matter @xmath45 decreases , the universe goes over from the lower curves to the upper ones , but it does not have enough time to close up to a big crunch .",
    "the universe subsequently goes over to curve ( 6 ) with @xmath130 , at which time it has a constant expansion for a fraction of a second .",
    "this then followed by going to the upper curves ( 7 ) and ( 8) with @xmath137 , where the universe expands with _ acceleration _ according to eq .",
    "8 fits the present situation of the universe . for curves ( 1)-(4 ) in the diagram we use the cutoff when the curves were at their maximum . in table 1",
    "we present the cosmic times with respect to the big bang , the cosmic radiation temperature and the pressure for each of the curves in fig",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the hubble diagrams for the distance - redshift relationship predicted by the theory for the accelerating expanding universe at the present time , and figures 4 and 5 show the experimental results .",

    "a computer best - fit can then fix both @xmath185 and @xmath184 .    to summarize , a theory of cosmology has been presented in which the dynamical variables are those of hubble , i.e. distances and velocities .",
    "the theory descirbes the universe as having a three - phase evolution with a decelerating expansion , followed by a constant and an accelerating expansion , and it predicts that the universe is now in the latter phase . as the density of matter decreases , while the universe is at the decelerating phase , it does not have enough time to close up to a big crunch .",
    "rather , it goes to the constant - expansion phase , and then to the accelerating stage .",
    "as we have seen , the equation obtained for the universe expansion , eq .",
    "( 51 ) , is very simple .",
    "the einstein gravitational field equations with the added cosmological term are [ 9 ] : @xmath189 where @xmath3 is the cosmological constant , the value of which is supposed to be determined by experiment . in eq .",
    "( 57 ) @xmath190 and @xmath60 are the ricci tensor and scalar , respectively , @xmath191 , where @xmath42 is newton s constant and the speed of light is taken as unity .",
    "recently the two groups ( the _ supernovae cosmology project _ and the _ high - z supernova team _ ) concluded that the expansion of the universe is accelerating [ 10 - 16 ] .",
    "the two groups had discovered and measured moderately high redshift ( @xmath192 ) supernovae , and found that they were fainter than what one would expect them to be if the cosmos expansion were slowing down or constant . both teams obtained @xmath193 and ruled out the traditional ( @xmath184 , @xmath194)=(1 , 0 ) universe .",
    "their value of the density parameter @xmath194 corresponds to a cosmological constant that is small but , nevertheless , nonzero and positive , @xmath195    in previous sections a four - dimensional cosmological theory ( cgr ) was presented .",
    "although the theory has no cosmological constant , it predicts that the universe accelerates and hence it has the equivalence of a positive cosmological constant in einstein s general relativity . in the framework of this theory ( see section 2 ) the zero - zero component of the field equations ( 3 ) is written as @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the critical mass density and @xmath6 is hubble s time in the zero - gravity limit .    comparing eq .",
    "( 60 ) with the zero - zero component of eq .",
    "( 57 ) , one obtains the expression for the cosmological constant of general relativity , @xmath198    to find out the numerical value of @xmath6 we use the relationship between @xmath180 and @xmath182 given by eq .",

    "we calculate the cosmological constant according to eq .",
    "one obtains @xmath217    our results confirm those of the supernovae experiments and indicate on the existance of the dark energy as has recently received confirmation from the boomerang cosmic microwave background experiment [ 18,19 ] , which showed that the universe is euclidean .",
    "in this paper the cosmological general relativity , a relativistic theory in spacevelocity , has been presented and applied to the problem of the expansion of the universe .",
    "the theory , which predicts a positive pressure for the universe now , describes the universe as having a three - phase evolution : decelerating , constant and accelerating expansion , but it is now in the latter stage .",
    "furthermore , the cosmological constant that was extracted from the theory agrees with the experimental result .",
    "finally , it has also been shown that the three - dimensional spatial space of the universe is euclidean , again in agreement with observations .    recently",
    "[ 20,21 ] , more confirmation to the universe accelerating expansion came from the most distant supernova , sn 1997ff , that was recorded by the hubble space telescope .",
    "as has been pointed out before , if we look back far enough , we should find a decelerating expansion ( curves 1 - 5 in figure 1 ) . beyond @xmath204",
    "one should see an earlier time when the mass density was dominant .",
    "the measurements obtained from sn 1997ff s redshift and brightness provide a direct proof for the transition from past decelerating to present accelerating expansion ( see figures 6 and 7 ) .",
    "the measurements also exclude the possibility that the acceleration of the universe is not real but is due to other astrophysical effects such as dust .",
    "table 2 gives some of the cosmological parameters obtained here and in the standard theory .",
    "in order to compare the present theory with general relativity , we now add the time coordinate .",
    "we then have a time - space - velocity universe with two time - like and three space - like coordinates , with signature @xmath218 .",
    "we will be concerned with the classical experiments of general relativity and the gravitational waves predicted by that theory . in the following",
    "we show that all these results are also obtained from the present theory . to this end",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "we first find the cosmological - equivalent of the schwarzschild spherically - symmetric solution in cosmology .",
    "it will be useful to change variables from the classical schwarzschild metric to new variables as follows : @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "we also change the time coordinate @xmath221 , thus @xmath222 is a time parameter .",
    "the classical schwarzschild solution will thus have the following form : @xmath223.\\eqno(71)\\ ] ] so far this is just the classical spherically symmetric solution of the einstein field equations in four dimensions , though written in new variables .",
    "the non - zero christoffel symbols are given by @xmath224 @xmath225 @xmath226 @xmath227 it is very lengthy , but one can verify that all components of the ricci tensor @xmath228 are equal to zero identically .",
    "we now extend this solution to cosmology . in order to conform with the standard notation",
    ", the zero component will be chosen as the time parameter , followed by the three space - like coordinates and then the fourth coordinate representing the velocity @xmath229 .",
    "we will make one more change by choosing @xmath230 , thus @xmath231 is the velocity parameter .",
