    "off - shell formulations of string theory are indispensable for understanding its nonperturbative aspects .",
    "string field theory ( sft ) is a promising off - shell formulation and recent remarkable progress in open string field theory enables us to investigate the dynamics of d - branes via tachyon condensation ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "most of these studies consider open string field theory on a d - brane .",
    "however , as d - branes are sources of closed strings , such d - brane systems should be coupled to a closed sft to give a complete description of tachyon condensation .",
    "there are several attempts to consider d - branes in the framework of closed sft .",
    "one way in this direction is to construct an open - closed sft by directly introducing both open and closed string fields @xcite .",
    "another approach is to introduce a d - brane boundary state @xmath0 as a source in a closed sft .",
    "the action of such a system would be given by adding a source term to a closed sft action @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a closed string field . here",
    "@xmath4 is a marginal ( on - shell ) operator describing open string excitations on the d - brane and @xmath5 parametrizes the boundary of the worldsheet . in @xcite , the authors considered the hikko closed sft @xcite with the source term in the presence of a constant electro - magnetic flux .",
    "they argued that the boundary state should transform under the closed string gauge transformation and found that the gauge invariance requires to add the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action to .",
    "the authors in @xcite also considered a closed sft with a source term representing a marginal deformation , namely .",
    "they pointed out that an ( interacting ) closed sft requires a modification of the deformed boundary state ; marginal deformations , which are expected to be solutions in open string theory , are no longer consistent solutions in open - closed string theory .",
    "in most of these previous studies based on boundary states and closed sft , the open string excitations have been taken to be on - shell .",
    "the aim of this paper is to generalize those open string fluctuations into off - shell cases . for this purpose ,",
    "we adopt boundary string field theory ( bsft ) @xcite .",
    "bsft , which is a version of open string field theory , is formulated on the space of all boundary operators including off - shell ones .",
    "although bsft is originally defined in terms of a worldsheet sigma model with boundary interactions , it can be reformulated by using boundary states @xcite .",
    "this would suggest that bsft is more suitable for introducing couplings with closed sfts than cubic open sft @xcite .",
    "we thus seek for an open - closed sft whose open string sector is bsft .",
    "we expect that this open - closed sft is a natural extension of @xcite .",
    "we refer to this open - closed sft as boundary open - closed string field theory .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give a short review on the batalin - vilkovisky ( bv ) formalism for classical open - closed sft and derive a gauge transformation law . in the construction of a sft ,",
    "a guiding principle is the stringy gauge invariance .",
    "the bv formalism @xcite is useful for this purpose since an action satisfying the bv master equation automatically has gauge invariance .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite that a classical open - closed sft should satisfy the bv classical open - closed master equations , which is the classical part of the full bv master equation .",
    "we examine how those master equations determine the gauge transformation .",
    "we also provide basic ingredients for the construction of our open - closed sft .    in section [ oc - interaction ] , we couple bsft to a free closed sft with the conventional open - closed interaction as in .",
    "we then add appropriate terms required by the bv classical open - closed master equations . in this manner",
    ", we find that the joining - splitting type 3-closed - string interaction is required from the bv master equation .",
    "an essential point is the utilization of the factorization property of conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "however , even with the joining - splitting type vertex , there also exists a region of string length parameters where the master equation is not satisfied . for this reason",
    ", it seems difficult to find an open - closed sft action which completely satisfies the master equation in our framework . though this is somewhat disappointing , as demonstrated in section [ gauge ]",
    ", we can still show that the resulting action has gauge invariance if we restrict the string length of the gauge parameter to negative .",
    "in the final section , we shall briefly discuss the relation between our open - closed sft and the d - brane soliton state in a closed sft @xcite .",
    "our conventions and some useful formulas are summarized in appendices .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the bv formalism for classical open - closed sft and derive the gauge transformation law for string fields . the term ` classical ' represents a theory without loops , namely consisting only of diagrams with genus zero and at most one boundary .",
    "we also review bsft , which is our starting point in constructing our open - closed sft .      in an open - closed sft , a closed string field @xmath6 and an open string field @xmath7",

    "similarly , an open sft action @xmath37 can be constructed to be a solution of the master equation @xmath38 the same argument as above leads to the gauge transformation law in the open string side @xmath39    however , once open - closed interactions are taken into account , the master equations above are not a consistent classical truncation . to see this ,",
