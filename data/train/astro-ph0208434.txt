    "the last five years have seen a growing appreciation of the diversity of galaxy properties at @xmath193 . in part",
    "this has arisen from an impressive improvement in the quality of the observations of galaxies at these redshifts  driven by the availability of powerful new instruments on 8-m class telescopes ( e.g.  nirspec on keck and isaac on the vlt ) .",
    "however , an equal role has been played by the realization of the necessity of a multi - wavelength approach to studies of galaxy evolution at @xmath19 .",
    "thus a range of new surveys spanning wavebands from the x - ray , near- and mid - infrared , submillimeter and out to the radio , have complimented the traditional view of distant galaxies based on uv / optical observations .",
    "these new studies have all tended to stress the role of dust obscuration in censoring our view of the galaxy population at high redshifts , and especially in disguising the extent of activity in the most luminous systems , both agn and star - forming .",
    "indeed , our current , incomplete , knowledge of the evolution of dusty galaxies suggests that some of the most active galaxies in the distant universe may be so obscured as to be undetectable in even the most sensitive uv / optical observations ( e.g.  haarsma et al .",
    "2000 ; smail et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "one central theme to appear from this new multi - wavelength view of galaxy formation is the ubiquity of optically - faint , but bright near - infrared , counterparts to sources identified in many wavebands : in the x - ray ( alexander et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ; cowie et al .",
    "2001 ; page et al .  2002 ; stevens et al .  2002 ; mainieri et al .",
    "2002 ) , the mid - infrared ( pierre et al .  2001 ; smith et al .  2001 ;",
    "franceschini et al .",
    "2002 ) , submillimeter ( smail et al .  1999a",
    "; lutz et al .  2001 ; ivison et al .  2002 ) and radio bands ( richards et al .  1999 ; chapman et al .",
    "this has resulted in a renaissance in interest in such extremely red objects ( eros )  a class of galaxies which had previously been viewed as a curiosity with little relevance to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution , comprising as they do a mere @xmath2910% of the population at @xmath30 .",
    "the ero class is photometrically - defined ",
    "the most frequently used definition is now @xmath2 .",
    "this very red optical - near - infrared color is intended to isolate two broad populations of galaxies at @xmath19 : those which are red by virtue of the presence of large amounts of dust ( resulting from active star formation ) , as well as passive systems whose red colors arise from the dominance of old , evolved stars in their stellar populations .",
    "the very different natures of these two sub - classes has prompted efforts to disentangle their relative contributions to the ero population ( pozzetti & mannucci 2000 ; mannucci et al .",
    "2002 ) so that well - defined samples can be used to test galaxy formation models ( daddi et al .",
    "2000 ; smith et al .",
    "2002a ; firth et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "studies of the ero population have turned up hints of the diverse nature of this population , including an apparent break in the number counts of eros at @xmath2720 ( mccarthy et al .",
    "2001 ; smith et al .",
    "this feature is roughly 2mags fainter than the well known break in the total @xmath26-band counts of the faint field population ( gardner et al .",
    "the cumulative count slope of eros ( @xmath31 ) drops from @xmath32 at bright magnitudes to @xmath33 for the fainter eros ( e.g.  smith et al .",
    "2002a ; chen et al .",
    "2002 ; fig .  2 ) .",
    "this break in the counts could either result from a relatively narrow redshift range probed by the selection criteria of eros  with the change in the integrated counts then being simply related to the form of the luminosity function of the ero population , or it may reflect differing evolutionary behavior in sub - populations  where one class of eros declines rapidly beyond @xmath27 . to test this suggestion we need to track the relative mix of galaxy types within the ero population to @xmath3420 .",
    "techniques to separate the passive , evolved and obscured , active populations include near - infrared photometric classifications ( pozzetti & mannucci 2000 ; smith et al .  2002a ; mannucci et al .",
    "2002 ) , submillimeter emission ( dey et al .  1999",
    "; mohan et al .  2002 ) , x - ray emission ( alexander et al .  2001 , 2002 ; brusa et al .",
    "2002 ) and optical / near - infrared spectroscopy ( cimatti et al .  2002",
    "; smith et al.2001 , 2002b ) . of these approaches ,",
    "by far the largest and most influential project is the `` k20 '' survey undertaken by cimatti et al.(2002 ) who obtained spectroscopic classifications for 29 eros with @xmath35 and @xmath36 from a full sample of 45 .",
    "the median redshift of their @xmath35 sample is @xmath37 , with galaxies spread across @xmath381.4 ( see daddi et al .",
    "2001 ) and they find that their sample is split equally into passive , evolved and active , dusty eros : 3164% versus 6733% , where the ranges reflect the uncertainty due to the incompleteness in their survey . the k20 survey has significantly increased our knowledge of the ero population , however , it is reliant on identifying emission lines in the restframe uv spectra of possibly dusty galaxies , which results in an incomplete and perhaps biased view of the mix of galaxies within the population . moreover , the magnitude limit achieved for the high completeness sample , @xmath35 , means that it ca nt be used to track the variation in the properties of the population across the break in the counts of eros .    here",
    "we apply a new technique to investigate the mix of the ero population at faint magnitudes : using very deep radio observations at 1.4ghz which are both sensitive enough to identify strongly star forming galaxies out to high redshifts , @xmath192 , and yet insensitive to the effects of dust obscuration ( mohan et al .",
    "2002 ; chapman et al .",
    "radio surveys to sub - mjy flux limits have shown the usefulness of this technique for identifying star - forming galaxies in the distant universe ",

    "( _ hst _ ) imaging show many are blue disk galaxies ( windhorst et al .",
    "1994 ; richards et al .  1998 ; richards 2000 ) , with optical spectroscopy confirming that these are apparently normal star forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( benn et al.1993 ; mobasher et al .  1999",
    "; roche , lowenthal & koo 2002 ) , with a small proportion of agn ( 20% based on their radio morphologies in very high - resolution maps from combined vla and merlin observations , muxlow et al .  1999 , with most of these having blue colors ) .",
    "however , the spectral properties of the galaxies in these surveys also show signatures of the presence of dust , which may be cloaking the strength of the activity in these systems and making them appear more mundane than they should ( hammer et al .",
    "1995 ; poggianti & wu 2000 ; smail et al .",
    "1999b ) .",
    "more recently , samples of faint radio sources have begun to be used to attempt to identify obscured star - forming galaxies at even higher redshifts . by focusing on those radio sources with faint or undetectable counterparts in the optical these surveys attempt to isolate the most distant star forming galaxies in the radio samples ( richards et al .",
    "1999 ; barger et al .",
    "2000 ; chapman et al .",
    "2001 , 2002b ) .",
    "sensitive submillimeter observations of these optically - faint radio sources confirm that a large fraction of them are luminous , dusty systems at redshifts of @xmath133  although , as with the whole submillimeter galaxy population , there is still considerable uncertainty over their exact redshifts ( chapman et al .",
    "the relationship between these highly obscured , but very luminous galaxies and the perhaps less - obscured systems selected through lyman-@xmath24 emission and the lyman - break technique is a crucial issue for a complete understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies ( smail et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "the project described here seeks to trace the population of the luminous , dusty galaxies detected in the submillimeter at @xmath39 to lower redshifts and lower luminosities .",
    "these samples should be more amenable to detailed study and so provide a clearer connection between the evolution of the obscured and unobscured galaxies over the lifetime of the universe ( chapman et al.2002b ) .",
    "in this paper we use an extremely deep vla radio map to investigate the radio emission from a sample of ero galaxies at a sensitivity limit sufficient to detect strongly star forming galaxies at @xmath402 .",
    "we also present extensive optical / near - infrared imaging of this ero sample .",
    "we exploit this deep @xmath0 photometry to analyse the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the eros and investigate their properties in detail .",
    "we present our observations , their reduction and cataloging in the next section , describe our analysis and results in  3 , and discuss these in  4 before giving our conclusions in  5 . throughout",
    "we assume a cosmological model with @xmath41 and @xmath42kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 .",
    "if we instead adopted the currently fashionable @xmath43kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 cosmology , then for a source at @xmath46 all the linear sizes we derive would be 6% smaller , the luminosities would be 12% fainter and the volume densities would be 12% lower .",
    "the field used for our analysis contains the @xmath47 cluster a851 ( cl0939 + 4713 ) .",
    "this well - studied cluster is relatively rich , but very irregular in appearance ( dressler et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 , 2002 ; iye et al .  2001 ; schindler et al .  1998 ) . as we discuss below , although cluster members may contribute significantly to the optically - bright radio population in this field , the extremely red radio sources discussed in this work all probably lie at @xmath19 and hence are unassociated with the foreground cluster .    the other influence which the cluster may have is as a gravitational lens . however , a851 is not a particularly concentrated cluster ( seitz et al .",
    "1996 ; trager et al .  1997 ; iye et al .",
    "2000 ) and the wide field coverage of our sample , compared with the cluster s critical radius ( only two of the eros in our sample lie within 1@xmath48 of the cluster center , roughly corresponding to 2@xmath49 the critical radius ) , suggests that lensing by the cluster will have a minimal effect on the surface density in our sample ( @xmath50% integrated over the whole area of our survey ) and is unlikely to grossly effect the morphologies of any of the eros in our study .",
    "the radio image of a851 comprises a combination of a , b , c , and d configuration observations from the national radio astronomy observatory s vla taken at 1.4ghz between 1996 and 2000 . for each observation ,",
    "`` 4 '' mode was used for the correlator with @xmath51 mhz spectral channels for each of two ifs and two polarizations .",
    "this mode was employed to allow a map to be made of the entire primary beam at the highest spatial resolution possible with the vla ( @xmath52 fwhm ) and with the best compromise between radial smearing of the image due to the finite bandwidth and sensitivity . however , as is noted below , some penalty does result from this choice .",
    "the total integration time of the combined dataset is @xmath53 hours on source .",
    "the dataset was imaged using the aips program imagr .",
    "the 74 facets were used including 37 within the primary beam and 37 outside the primary beam , each of the latter centered on a bright confusing source .",
    "each of the datasets from the four configurations were self - calibrated using intermediate images as input to the aips program calib . a more complete description of the reduction process is included in owen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the analysis presented here focuses on the central facet from the full map , a @xmath54 field in the center of the primary beam : 09 42 48.614 + 46 59 59.72 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the final map reaches a 1-@xmath5 noise level of 3.5@xmath6jybeam@xmath8 in the central part of this field  making this the deepest 1.4-ghz map ever made .",
    "however , in the extreme corners of the area being analyzed the actual peak flux density is reduced by about @xmath55 due to the primary beam attenuation and radial bandwidth smearing caused by the finite bandwidth of each spectral channel .",
    "we therefore adopt a conservative 3-@xmath5 limit of 12.6@xmath6jy in the corrected peak flux density over the entire area being studied .",
    "we can probe down to 3-@xmath5 significance limit and still retain a very low level of false detections as we are searching for radio emission at the known positions of a relatively small number of eros , compared to the number of independent beams in our map ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the synthesized beam of our final map is circular and has a fwhm of @xmath57 , this allows us to resolve radio sources with sizes @xmath58 and we discuss the sizes of radio emission from the eros in our survey in the following sections .    1",
    "our primary near - infrared imaging dataset comes from wide - field images in @xmath59 taken with the kpno 2.1-m telescope , these cover a @xmath60 field of view to @xmath61 .",
    "these images have relatively coarse sampling and so we have also obtained higher resolution @xmath62 and @xmath26 images covering a smaller , @xmath63 , field of view from the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) and the 3.8-m uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) respectively .",
    "the wht and ukirt observations cover the bulk of the region included in the analysis here and they thus provide a useful confirmation of the identifications and photometry of eros in this field .",
    "standard reduction procedures were applied to all datasets and they were calibrated using ukirt faint standards ( hawarden et al .",

    "the total exposure time was 75ks , spread equally over the nine pointings to give a per - pixel exposure time of 8.3ks .",
    "the images were reduced in a standard manner using iraf scripts .",
    "flat fields were constructed from the dithered exposures at each pointing to produce a flat field centered in time on each exposure .",
    "distortion corrections were measured from a comparison of bright objects in the near - infrared images with existing , deep @xmath66-band images and these were applied to align the images in the three passbands to a common coordinate grid , at a level of 0.1 pixel rms or better .",
    "these observations were obtained in a mix of photometric and non - photometric conditions , with seeing of 1.51.8@xmath12 fwhm . to calibrate the photometry in the three bands we exploit the precise @xmath59 photometry of this field published by stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson ( 1995 ) . by comparing the photometry for a large number of bright galaxies in the field we estimate a typical zero - point error of @xmath67mags on our photometric scale .",

    "each pointing has a total integration time of 2.4ks and reaches a limit of @xmath73 for point sources .",
    "the median seeing for these observations was 0.5@xmath12 and several of the mosaic tiles have 0.35@xmath12 seeing , while periods of sub-0.25@xmath12 seeing were experienced .",
    "these frames allow us to confirm the reality of eros in the field and investigate the morphologies of the brighter examples .      on 2000 december 1112 we used the ingrid near - infrared imager ( packham et al .",

    "the optical imaging to complement our deep near - infrared datasets was obtained from three facilities .",
    "we have two wide - field imaging datasets of this region : the first comes from suprime - cam on subaru ( courtesy of dr t.  kodama ) , and consists of very deep @xmath75 imaging of a @xmath76 field centered on the cluster core .",
    "we also have obtained similarly wide - field kpno 4-m image in the @xmath77-band to bridge the spectral coverage of our optical and near - infrared datasets .",
    "finally , an _ hst / wfpc2 _ mosaic of a851 has been observed in the f702w filter , this covers a 7.5@xmath72 region around the cluster core , within the area studied here , and provides very detailed morphological information on the optically - bright galaxies in this area ( dressler et al .",

    "the processed image combined five individual exposures , shifted so the combination eliminated areas lost to gaps between individual ccd chips . after applying chip - by - chip sky flats ,",
    "each exposure was projected onto an astrometric pixel grid and coadded with appropriate masking for gaps and bad pixels .",
    "the data were taken in photometric conditions and the final 7.2ks exposure has seeing of 1.0@xmath12 fwhm and a 3-@xmath5 limiting magnitude of @xmath85 in our standard 3@xmath12 diameter aperture .      to catalog near - infrared sources in the field of a851 we ran sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) on the @xmath26-band image of the field  first convolving the image with a @xmath86-diameter top - hat kernel and then searching for sources with areas greater than the seeing - disk above an isophote defined as @xmath87 mag .",

    "2002 ; snigula et al .",

    "we assume that their optical and near - infrared colors are dominated by a co - eval starburst ( which produces the dust )  although the agn may contribute significantly to the radio emission from the system . by relying on just two simple classes of sed we will clearly fail to describe any systems with more complex mixes of evolved stars and obscured and unobscured young stars ( a situation which may be common place in many of these systems at high-@xmath77 , e.g.  the edge - on bulge - strong disk galaxy ero # 1931 , fig .  4 and table  1 ) . however , by concentrating on those eros which are well - fitted by these simple models we can determine the relative proportion of eros at the extremes of these classes .    for this test we employ a single star formation model described by an exponential declining star formation rate with a e - folding time ( @xmath209 ) of 1gyr , a miller - scalo imf and solar metallicity .",

    "the redshift of the ero is allowed to vary between @xmath2143 , a large enough range to comfortably encompass all of the eros in cimatti et al .",
    "the upper limit on the redshift removes the possibility of fitting infeasibly high redshifts due to the 4000  break being confused with the lyman break , although we note that at least one ero in our sample has a proposed redshift of @xmath215 ( # 01206 , smail et al .",
    "2002 ) .    to obtain useful constraints from our analysis , we first require that the ero is detected in at least 3 passbands at more than 3-@xmath5 , this reduces the samples to 17 radio - detected eros and 30 radio undetected eros .",

    "the median colors of the various subsamples of radio - undetected eros are given in table  2 .",
    "the dispersion of the colors of the individual eros in each subsample around their median are also listed there , these show that the dispersion within the subsamples of radio undetected eros classed as dusty or evolved is less than that seen for the whole sample .",
    "this confirms that as expected the photometric classifications isolate more homogeneous subsamples from the overall radio - undetected ero population , with the exception of the badly - fit subsample whose larger dispersion suggests that it still contains a mix of sed types .",
    "the strong preference for fitting the colors of high - snr radio - detected eros with the dusty sed model , 11/12 well - fit examples , gives us confidence that this model can be reliably employed to identify similarly dusty , active systems in the radio - undetected ero sample and hence estimate the prevalence of such galaxies in the full ero population .",
    "taking the estimate that at least 20% ( 9/45 ) of the radio - undetected eros have dusty seds and including the 11 high - snr , radio - detected eros with similar photometric classifications , we conclude that at least @xmath232% ( 20/45 ) of those eros with well - sampled seds have colors compatible with dusty starbursts , or @xmath233% ( 20/66 ) of _ all _ eros with @xmath234 and @xmath138 ( median @xmath235 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate of the proportion of dusty starbursts at @xmath35 ( median @xmath236 ) of 3367% from cimatti et al.(2002 ) .",
    "there are two different assumptions which can now be made to broaden this constraint : one addresses the failure rate for fitting dusty eros with our model sed , the other with the number of dusty systems in the low - snr ero sample .",
    "firstly , we could assume that the proportion of dusty seds in the high - snr radio - detected sample is the same as that measured for those eros with well - fitted seds , 92% ( 11/12 ) , i.e.  that the majority of the radio - detected eros have dusty seds .",
    "based on this we can then estimate the failure rate for fitting the colors of a dusty ero with our model template as 5/16 . adopting the same failure rate for the dusty galaxies in the high - snr radio - undetected sample , which have similar quality photometry ,",
    "means that half of the badly - fit eros are actually dusty galaxies ( we would get the same estimate if we had simply proportioned the badly - fit ero sample on the basis of the relative numbers of the successful fits ) . hence we would estimate that at least 46% ( 13/28 ) of the high - snr radio - undetected eros have dusty seds . adding in the radio - detected eros then leads to a lower limit of @xmath237% on the proportion of dusty starbursts in the full ero sample .",
    "secondly , we could assume , based on the overall similarity of their median colors , that the high - snr eros are representative of the full samples .",
    "if this assumption is adopted then we would again conclude that a minimum of @xmath238% of the eros in our full sample have colors which are well - fit by a dust - reddened starburst .",
    "hence , either of these assumptions would suggest that a minimum of about a half of the @xmath234 and @xmath138 ero population have colors consistent with those expected for dusty starbursts . as these two assumptions",
    "are independent , we can also combine them by applying the mis - classification correction to the radio - detected and undetected samples ( giving 16/17 and 13/28 ) and then assuming that the relative proportions of eros of the photometric types in the high - snr samples apply independently to the full samples ( yielding 20/21 and 21/45 ) . in this way we estimate that perhaps @xmath239% of the full ero sample are distant , dusty starburst / agns , with the remainder being passive systems ( although these may also include a small number of very high - redshift galaxies , e.g.  waddington et al .",
    "this estimate of the proportion of evolved and dusty eros in the @xmath138 population is of course also sensitive to the strong clustering of the passive ero population .",
    "our photometric classification also provides some other information about the eros : in particular the best - fit redshift and reddening .",
    "however , the limited precision of our photometry and the strong degeneracies between these parameters means that they should be viewed with caution . for the high - snr , radio - detected eros , which are well - fit by the dusty sed ,",
    "the median redshift is @xmath240 , with a quartile range of @xmath2411.5 .",
    "this range is very similar to that seen in the spectroscopic survey of cimatti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and gives us some confidence in the average properties we determine for this population .",
    "the median reddening for this sample is @xmath242 . for the radio - undetected eros , those galaxies which are fitted with a dusty sed give a similar median redshift of @xmath243 and a slightly lower reddening of @xmath244 .",
    "these estimated reddenings are consistent with that estimated for their composite spectrum of star - forming eros by cimatti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , @xmath245 . for both subsamples",
    "the median @xmath26-band luminosities at the estimated redshifts corresponds to @xmath246 , or @xmath247 when corrected for reddening .",
    "the unobscured luminosities of these galaxies would be comparable to @xmath133 galaxies today , however , their young stellar populations would be expected to fade substantially and so it is clear that these galaxies are likely to evolve into sub-@xmath133 galaxies at the present - day , unless the current starburst continues for @xmath248yrs .",
    "next , we look at the relationship between our crude restframe visual morphologies and the preferred photometric classification for 28 eros ( 8 radio - detected and 20 radio - undetected , table  1 ) .",
    "the morphological mix in both cases is similar to the proportions of the different sed types , if we interpret the compact eros as passive , evolved systems ( mannucci et al .",
    "for the radio - undetected sample we find a broad equality between the classes : 29%:29%:42% for compact : disky / amorphous : faint , similar to 39%:32%:29% for the evolved , dusty and badly - fit seds .",
    "similarly , for the radio - detected sample , which is dominated by dusty seds , the morphological mix is : 0%:82%:18% compared to the distribution of sed fits : 6%:65%:29% .",
    "however , a one - to - one comparison for individual eros shows that while the distributions appear to be telling the same story , the individual galaxies are much more mixed : half of those eros with dusty seds have disky , amorphous or disturbed morphologies , but none of the eros with passive seds have compact morphologies ( this morphological class is almost evenly split between dusty seds and failed fits ) .",
    "we also note that there is no clear trend in the seds of those radio - detected eros which are resolved in our vla map .",
    "to summarize , we place a firm lower limit of @xmath233% on the proportion of dusty starbursts in the full @xmath234 and @xmath138 ero population . adopting two separate corrections for the number of dusty eros which are missed either due to the failure of our photometric classification or because they were removed due to their poor photometry",
    ", we propose that @xmath24950% is a more realistic lower limit on the fraction of dusty eros .",
    "finally , by combining these corrections we suggest that the actual fraction of eros with dusty starburst / agn - like colors is probably close to @xmath239% .",
    "we have estimated the relative proportion of dusty , active and passive , evolved systems in the @xmath18 ero population . by comparing this to the mix of classes estimated for the @xmath250 sample by cimatti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we can identify any decline in either class of eros which might be responsible for the apparent break in the ero counts at @xmath2720 ( mccarthy et al .",
    "2001 ; smith et al .",
    "the similarity of the two estimates suggests that there is no evidence for a significant shift in the mix of these two sub - populations across @xmath25120 , although it should be noted that the cimatti et al.sample is selected using a slightly bluer color criteria , @xmath252 , which complicates this comparison .",
    "this apparent lack of a substantial shift in the nature of the ero population may indicate that the break arises instead from the volume sampled  with @xmath28 eros populating a relative narrow redshift range .",
    "this volume would be bounded at the low redshift end by the requirement that the galaxy is observed at high enough redshift , i.e.  sufficiently far into the restframe uv , to enable a dust - reddened starburst or evolved stellar population to appear extremely red , @xmath2 ( daddi et al.2001 ; firth et al .",
    "observationally this appears to require @xmath2531 (  3.5 ; cimatti et al .",

    "the redshift limit may be imposed either by the luminosity function , passive bluing of the stellar population , or the increasing fraction of unobscured star formation in both sub - classes of ero ( the continuity between high-@xmath77 scuba galaxies and the radio - selected ero population suggested below would argue against the latter suggestion ) . if the break in the counts is due to the surveys reaching beyond the volume containing the ero population then the @xmath27 break ( fig .",
    "2 ) should roughly correspond to @xmath254 for a composite luminosity function with a schechter form .",
    "this would imply that the characteristic luminosity of the ero population is very similar to that seen in the local field , @xmath255 , and that the ero luminosity function has a faint end slope , @xmath24 , which is shallower than @xmath256 ( the slope of the differential counts beyond the break ) . to illustrate this we plot a toy model in fig .  2",
    ", this has a mix of gaussian luminosity functions each with mean luminosity of @xmath257 ( @xmath258 at @xmath214 , cole et al .",
    "2001 ) and a dispersion of @xmath259 ( similar to the width of the luminosity function of elliptical galaxies locally ) .",
    "these are combined to produce a redshift distribution with a mean redshift of @xmath260 and a dispersion of @xmath261 ( cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ; firth et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the cumulative counts calculated using a simple k - correction .",
    "clearly this toy model ( with some further tuning ) can reasonably reproduce the ero counts , indicating that a combination of a narrow luminosity function and a narrow redshift range are a sufficient , if not unique , explanation of the form of the counts of the whole ero population across @xmath26221 .",
    "however , such a model has two obvious shortcomings  firstly , it requires that the evolutionary behavior of the dusty and passive ero populations is similar , which seems highly unlikely , and secondly the required evolution means that the dusty , active eros selected in our radio map are distinct from the higher redshift and fainter counterparts to the scuba galaxies , rather than representing a simple continuity of the population to lower redshifts and brighter @xmath26-band fluxes . for these reasons",
    "we reject this model and construct a second toy model .    for the second model we assume that the number counts of dusty eros are well - described by the power - law slope estimated for the radio detected population in  3.1 , but with a normalization increased to reproduce the @xmath17% fraction of the @xmath138 ero population which we estimate have dusty seds .",
    "to this we add a gaussian population representing the passive sub - population and normalize the combined sample to reproduce the weighted cumulative surface density of eros at @xmath138 from thompson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and smith et al.(2002a ) .",
    "representative parameters for the passive sub - population require a mean magnitude of @xmath263 ( @xmath264 at @xmath214 assuming no evolution , or @xmath265 assuming passive evolution from @xmath266 ) and a fwhm of 1.2mag .",
    "we illustrate the cumulative counts of both sub - populations and the combined population in fig .  2 .",
    "we note that this model predicts that the relative proportions of dusty and evolved eros for a @xmath35 sample is 35%:65% , in agreement with the current limits from cimatti et al .",

    "2002 ; ivison et al.2002 ) and we therefore prefer it .",
    "a clear distinction between the alternative models will come from extending the counts of eros fainter , to @xmath26723 , and estimating the relative mix of evolved and dusty systems at these depths .",
    "however , the depth of the imaging required for such a survey , @xmath268 and @xmath269 , will make it observationally demanding .      the resolution of over a third of the radio - detected eros in our vla map , along with the close correlation between the radio and optical morphologies of these eros , suggests a common mechanism for the emission at these two wavelengths .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the emission in both bands is powered by massive star formation within an extended region  on a scale of @xmath270kpc .",
    "thus for at least a third of the radio - detected eros , star formation is likely to contribute the majority of the radio emission ( this includes one of the brightest radio eros , # 01053 ) .",
    "furthermore , we note that using the median 1.4-ghz surface brightnesses of these resolved eros and the star formation calibration discussed below , they are expected to have high star formation surface densities : @xmath271m@xmath11yr@xmath8kpc@xmath79 , more than sufficient to drive powerful winds .      to reliably quantify the star formation occurring in the complete radio - detected ero sample we must estimate the contamination from agn - dominated systems .",
    "the agn fraction in the whole @xmath6jy radio population can be determined from the spectroscopic and morphological surveys of @xmath6jy radio sources ( e.g.  muxlow et al .",

    "these suggest that at most 20% of radio sources at @xmath272jy are likely to be agn . however , these estimates are typically based on samples of radio sources with brighter optical counterparts than the ero sample analysed here ( and the agn tend to be the bluer sources in even these samples , roche , lowenthal & koo 2002 ; waddington et al .",

    "we conclude that at most 3% of the ero population with @xmath2 and @xmath138 are likely to host energetically dominant agn .",

    "while the occurrence of agn - dominated sources in the ero population is obviously low , the estimates derived above do not tell us how frequently radio - selected eros are detected in the x - ray waveband .",

    "( 2002 ) survey .",
    "three of the x - ray - detected sources with @xmath97 in alexander et al.(2002 ) are also detected in deep 1.4-ghz observations , two of these have x - ray and radio emission consistent with an x - ray bright starburst at @xmath13 , suggesting a surface density of @xmath281arcmin@xmath79 for x - ray - detected agns with @xmath6jy ero hosts , corresponding to @xmath282% of the whole radio - detected ero population .",
    "this rate of agn contamination is consistent with our identification of only one radio - detected ero with an evolved sed ( assuming the radio emission from this galaxy arises from a weak agn , see  3.5 ) , corresponding to 6% of the sample .",
    "we therefore adopt 6% as the agn contamination in our sample and conservatively assume that the radio emission from any eros hosting an agn is dominated by the agn .",
    "we can now use our ero sample to estimate the star formation density in the most obscured starbursts at @xmath13 ( cram et al .",
    "1998 ; oliver et al .  1998 ; haarsma et al .",
    "we calculate two estimates of the star formation density ",

    "those radio - undetected eros with dusty seds are likely to either be more distant or have typically lower star formation rates ( and hence radio fluxes ) than the radio - detected examples . based on the analysis in  3.5.2",
    "there is a hint that these galaxies have similar redshifts to the radio - detected eros , but lower reddening s  and hence perhaps lower star formation rates ( hopkins et al .",
    "2001 ) . using their estimated surface density and extrapolating the cumulative number counts of radio - detected eros in our field from  3.2",
    ", we would expect most of the dusty , radio - undetected eros to have radio fluxes above @xmath283jy and hence we assume that the typical dusty , radio - undetected ero has a radio flux of @xmath270@xmath6jy .",
    "for the second estimate we adopt the incompleteness estimates for the photometric classification from  3.5 and hence use 20 radio detections and 21 radio - undetected eros . simply summing the 1.4-ghz fluxes for these two subsamples we obtain a total radio flux of @xmath284@xmath6jy for the conservative case and 1370@xmath6jy for the more realistic estimate ( these include contributions from the radio - undetected starbursts of 90@xmath6jy and 210@xmath6jy respectively ) .",
    "applying our estimated agn contamination reduces both of these estimates by 6% , however , if this contamination preferentially effects the most luminous , unresolved radio eros then the radio fluxes could be reduced by as much as @xmath285% ( roughly half the difference between our `` conservative '' and `` realistic '' cases ) .",
    "hence we estimate cumulative restframe 1.4-ghz luminosities from star formation in the two subsamples of @xmath286whz and @xmath287whz respectively .",
    "these assume a k - correction based on a @xmath288 spectrum typical of star forming galaxies ( richards 1998 ) , which gives a correction of @xmath289 , where the error is dominated by the redshift range of the galaxies .",
    "we now use the local correlation between 1.4-ghz luminosity and far - infrared luminosity ( condon et al .",
    "1991 ) to convert this estimate into a cumulative far - infrared luminosity for the sample , we note that the validity of this correlation has recently been confirmed at the redshifts studied here by garrett ( 2002 ) . in this way we obtain cumulative far - infrared luminosities of : @xmath290 and @xmath291 respectively .",

    "if we instead adopt the new calibration of yun , reddy & condon ( 2001 ) , we would estimate star formation rates roughly half of the quoted values ( see also carilli et al .",
    "however , for comparison with previous work we retain the condon ( 1992 ) calibration . assuming a salpeter imf from 0.1100m@xmath11 these rates are @xmath295 higher .    to calculate the volume probed by our ero sample we use the photometric redshift estimates for the 20 radio - detected and undetected eros which are classed as dusty starbursts and find a quartile range of @xmath2411.5 ( in reasonable agreement with the spectroscopically determined redshift range from cimatti et al .",

    "our measurement of the star formation density in the radio - detected ero population at @xmath13 is comparable to estimates of that in h@xmath24-selected galaxies at these epochs ( yan et al .",

    "there is little or no overlap between the ero population used in our analysis and the classes of galaxies which are employed in these previous studies and hence their contributions to the total star formation density are distinct .",
    "this implies that the activity in obscured galaxies makes a sizable contribution to the total star formation at @xmath13 , especially when allowance is made for the proportion of the obscured star forming population which are missing from our ero sample due to the escape of a small fraction of uv light .",

    "2002 ) have @xmath330 , where the error represents the 1-@xmath5 dispersion , and a quartile range of @xmath2411.2 , somewhat narrower than the redshift range we use  and suggesting a volume for the sample closer to @xmath331mpc@xmath297 .",
    "adopting this volume would roughly double our estimate of the volume density of passive eros .",
    "the most frequently proposed local analogs to passive eros are elliptical galaxies , although it is clear that apparently passive eros embrace a wider cross - section of the @xmath13 population than just disk - less bulges ( smith et al .",
    "it is consequently difficult to compare the volume density of this population with that of their possible descendants at the present - day .",
    "however , we note that the combination of our reduction in the proportion of passive galaxies in the ero population , coupled with the increase in the diversity of their morphological counterparts identified by smith et al .",
    "( 2002b ) , means that previously well - fitting pure luminosity evolution models with a high redshift of formation , @xmath332 , will now over predict the ero counts at @xmath333 ( daddi et al .",
    "2000 ; firth et al .  2001 ; smith et al .",
    "this suggests there may be some scope for the recent formation ( or transformation ) of some fraction of the local elliptical galaxy population ( e.g.  aguerri & trujillo 2002 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the reduction in the proportion of passive systems in the ero population is still not sufficient to reconcile the observed surface density of evolved eros with that predicted by semi - analytic galaxy formation models ( smith et al .",
    "2002a ; cole et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the proposed reduction in the passive ero fraction also has ramifications for several previous results based on the properties of the whole ero population .",
    "the most obvious is the interpretation of the strong clustering signal seen in ero samples ( daddi et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "the strong angular clustering of the ero population , especially for the brightest examples , appears to vindicate the predictions of hierarchical galaxy formation models assuming these galaxies represent the passive , evolved progenitors of present - day ellipticals ( firth et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the same manner ,",
    "the apparent agreement between the angular clustering of lyman - break objects at @xmath334 and theoretical models of halo clustering has provided support for the suggestion that these objects are the progenitors of massive ellipticals ( giavalisco & dickinson 2001 ) .",
    "however , the presence of a large proportion of , perhaps weakly clustered , dusty eros in the bright ero population would tend to dilute the angular clustering signal arising from the strongly clustered passive eros , unless there is a strong cross - correlation between the two populations ( see daddi et al .",
    "2002 and  3.3 ) .",
    "indeed , a further element comes into play when attempting to interpret the projected clustering of ero samples : the redshift depth of the volume containing the galaxies . if the passive ero population lies in a relatively narrow redshift range ( see the toy models in  4.1 ; firth et al .",
    "2001 ) then the dilution effect from the depth of the sample will be less than anticipated , requiring an intrinsically less strongly clustered population to produced a given angular clustering signal ( daddi et al .",
    "thus the effects of a narrower redshift depth for the evolved ero subsample and the increased proportion of weakly - clustered , but typically faint , dusty eros may cancel each other out leaving the estimated correlation length for the bright , evolved eros close to that required for the progenitors of the @xmath335 elliptical galaxies seen in the local universe , as estimated by daddi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and mccarthy et al .",
    "we conclude that the complex interplay between the sample volume and the mix of evolved and obscured galaxies in the ero population as a function of apparent magnitude means that the interpretation of the angular clustering of this class of galaxies is far from trivial .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are :    \\1 ) we catalog 68 eros within a 72.8 arcmin@xmath336 field which has the deepest 1.4-ghz observations of any region on the sky .",
    "we find that 31% of these eros are detected in the radio map down to a flux limit of 12.6@xmath6jy , of these radio - detected eros , 33% are resolved in our vla map with a typical fwhm of @xmath337  equivalent to @xmath158kpc at @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the radio emission in these eros mirrors their @xmath66-band morphologies , suggesting that star formation is responsible for the bulk of the radio flux .",
    "\\2 ) using our deep @xmath0 imaging we photometrically classify the radio - detected and undetected eros into dusty or evolved systems based on simple sed models .",
    "we first analyse the colors of those radio - detected with high quality photometry and conclude that the majority of these are adequately described by a highly dust - reddened starburst spectrum .",
    "this provides support for applying this analysis to the radio - undetected eros to search for similar obscured , active galaxies .",
    "\\3 ) using our simple photometric models we estimate that more than 32% of the radio - undetected eros with high quality photometry , or a minimum of 20% of all radio - undetected eros , have the colors of dusty starbursts , similar to the radio - detected eros .",
    "we estimate the rate of mis - classification of eros in our analysis assuming that most of the radio - detected eros are actually dusty starbursts , and based on this propose that @xmath338% of the eros with radio fluxes @xmath339jy have dusty seds .  from the continuity of the number counts of radio - detected eros",
    "we would expect that most of these sources would have 1.4-ghz fluxes around 5@xmath6jy .",
    "we also find that one of the 68 eros has an sed consistent with galactic star , while another apparent ero appears to be a transient source .",
    "\\4 ) combining the samples of radio - detected and undetected eros which are photometrically classified as dusty we place a firm lower limit of @xmath233% on the proportion of dusty starbursts in the whole ero population . to obtain a more realistic estimate",
    "we adopt a correction for mis - classification and assume the resulting proportions of dusty and evolved eros are representative of the full sample ( not just those with the best photometry ) we estimate that at least 4550% , and possibly up to @xmath340% , of the _ whole _ ero population with @xmath2 and @xmath18 are probably dusty , active galaxies .",
    "our fitting procedure also suggests a median redshift of @xmath341 with a quartile range of @xmath2411.5 .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the spectroscopic survey of somewhat brighter and bluer eros by cimatti et al .",
    "assuming that agn do not dominate the radio emission from these galaxies , we estimate a volume density of eros with far - infrared luminosities of @xmath342 ( i.e.  ulirgs ) of @xmath343mpc@xmath23 , this is over an order of magnitude higher than for equivalent luminosity events at @xmath214 and confirms the strong evolution of the most dusty , active galaxies out to @xmath19 ( blain et al .",
    "1999a ) .",
    "\\5 ) we use the local far - infrared  radio correlation to estimate star formation rates from the radio fluxes of the dusty eros , assuming that their radio emission is purely powered by massive star formation . combining these estimates with the probable volume spanned by our dusty ero subsample",
    "we can calculate the star formation density in this obscured population .",
    "adopting conservative assumptions we find that the star formation density in star forming eros at @xmath13 probably exceeds @xmath2990.1100m@xmath300m@xmath11yr@xmath8mpc@xmath23 and maybe as high as @xmath344m@xmath11yr@xmath8mpc@xmath23 .",
    "this measurement is comparable to estimates of the star formation density in h@xmath24-selected galaxies at these epochs , and greater than that seen in optically  selected galaxies , showing that the activity in obscured systems may make a significant contribution to the total star formation at @xmath13 .",
    "we also estimate that the dusty ero population may produce up to 510% of the far - infrared background at its peak at @xmath320 m , underlining the cosmological significance of these events for understanding the history of star formation in the universe .",
    "\\6 ) we propose that the apparent break in the integrated counts of the eros at @xmath2720 reflects the peak of the contribution from passive , evolved galaxies to this population . at magnitudes fainter than @xmath333",
    "we predict that the population will be increasing dominated by dusty , active galaxies .",
    "the continuity in the properties of these faint dusty eros connects them to samples of submm - selected obscured starbursts at higher redshifts and fainter @xmath26-band magnitudes .",
    "this proposal can be tested by studies of the multiwavelength properties of extremely faint samples of eros , @xmath345 , and their relationship to the blank - field populations of radio sources .",
    "\\7 ) by identifying the likely contribution from dusty eros to the total ero population we estimate that the volume density of passive , evolved galaxies brighter than @xmath18 is @xmath346mpc@xmath23 .",
    "recent results point to a morphological diversity in the passive ero population which would suggest that these galaxies should not be simply viewed as passively evolving ellipticals ( smith et al .",
    "we conclude that previously well - fitting pure luminosity evolution models , which described the number counts of the whole ero sample as due to a passively evolving elliptical population formed at high redshifts , will probably over predict the number of truly passive eros and hence there is scope for the recent ( trans)formation of some local elliptical galaxies . nevertheless ,",
    "the presence of luminous , passive galaxies at @xmath13 does point to a phase of massive spheroid formation at higher redshifts , consistent with the interpretation of the scuba population as the formation phase of massive , proto - ellipticals ( lilly et al .",
    "1999 ; smail et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "the typical , reddening - corrected luminosities of the radio - detected ero population at @xmath13 suggests that these galaxies will evolve into sub-@xmath335 systems by the present - day unless their star formation activity continues at a high rate for @xmath347yrs .",
    "the area analysed in this work covers a small fraction of the sensitive field of our vla map  we expect to be able to quadruple the ero sample available for analysis in the near future .",
    "in addition we are undertaking a full photometric analysis of the @xmath348 optically - bright @xmath6jy radio sources in this field using our panoramic @xmath349 imaging dataset ( owen et al.2002 ) , constrained by deep spectroscopy from gmos on gemini .",

    "<S> this map reaches a 1-@xmath5 limiting flux density of 3.5@xmath6jy making it the deepest 1.4-ghz map taken and is sensitive enough to detect an active galaxy with @xmath7whz@xmath8 at @xmath9 . if powered by a starburst , this radio luminosity is equivalent to a star - formation rate of @xmath10m@xmath11yr@xmath8 for stars more massive than 5m@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we identify radio counterparts to 21 of the eros in this field with radio fluxes above 12.6@xmath6jy and resolve a third of these with our 1.6@xmath12 fwhm beam . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral energy distributions of the majority of these galaxies are consistent with those expected for dust - reddened starbursts at @xmath13 . at these redshifts </S>",
