    "one of the most important experimental findings at rhic has been the signature of coalescence as the mechanism of particle production .",
    "the differences in baryons and mesons at the intermediate transverse momentum ( @xmath4 gev / c ) for observables like the nuclear modification factor and the elliptic flow parameter have been attributed to be the signatures of quark coalescence as a mechanism of hadron production  @xcite .",
    "however , it is experimentally difficult to study how local correlations and energy / entropy play a role in coalescence at the partonic level since the constituents are not directly observable . in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , light nuclei and anti - nuclei",
    "are formed through coalescence of nucleons and anti - nucleons  @xcite .",
    "the binding energy for the light nuclei are small , hence this formation process can only happen at a late stage of the evolution of the system when interactions between nucleons and other particles are weak .",
    "this process is called final - state coalescence  @xcite .",
    "the coalescence probability is related to the local nucleon density .",
    "therefore , the production of light nuclei provides an interesting tool to measure collective motion and freeze - out properties .",
    "the advantage of nucleons over the partonic coalescence phenomena is that both the nuclei and the constituent nucleon space - momentum distributions are measurable quantities in heavy - ion collisions . by studying the elliptic flow of nuclei and comparing to those of their constituents ( nucleons )",
    ", we will have a better understanding of coalescence process for hadronization .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the elliptic flow parameter , @xmath0 , is the second order fourier coefficient of the azimuthal distribution of the produced nuclei relative to the reaction plane of the initial nucleus - nucleus collision . the event - plane method was used to obtain the @xmath0 of nuclei  @xcite , with the event plane resolution used for correction ( calculated using the sub - event method  @xcite ) being 73% for minimum bias triggered events . in the following discussions",
    "only statistical errors will be shown .",

    "[ flow_fig_1 ] shows @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 in minimum - bias ( 0 - 80% centrality ) collisions .",
    "the @xmath0 of @xmath5 is shown only for @xmath7 gev / c . in the future ,",
    "high statistics data sets and good particle identification using star tpc and tof ( time - of - flight ) will allow us to study the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath0 for @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath0 of @xmath9 and @xmath10 measured by the star @xcite are also shown for the comparison .",
    "the @xmath0 of @xmath11(@xmath9 ) , @xmath12(@xmath13 ) and @xmath14(@xmath15 ) are well described by the dynamical coalescence model @xcite . in this model , the probability for producing a cluster of nucleons ( @xmath12 , @xmath16 and @xmath14 ) is determined by the overlap of its wigner phase - space density with the nucleon phase - space distributions at freeze - out . to determine the wigner phase - space densities of the @xmath12 , @xmath16 and @xmath14 , we take their hadron wave functions to be those of a spherical harmonic oscillator .",
    "the coordinate and momentum space distributions of hadrons at freeze - out are obtained from ampt model calculation  @xcite .",
    "the results with both @xmath0 and transverse kinetic energy @xmath17 , where @xmath18 scaled by @xmath3 are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ flow_fig_1 ] . as a comparison ,",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath19 @xmath0 @xcite are superimposed on the plot .",
    "the data suggest that the @xmath14(@xmath15 ) , @xmath12(@xmath13 ) and baryon @xmath0 seem to follow the @xmath3 scaling within errors , indicating that the light nuclei are formed through the coalescence of nucleons just before thermal freeze - out .    the left panel of fig .",

    "the scaled results for @xmath0 versus @xmath23 for the light nuclei and anti - nuclei are consistent with the experimentally observed ncq scaling of @xmath0 for baryons and mesons @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the picture that partonic collectivity dominates the transverse expansion dynamics of the nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic .",

    "the @xmath0 of @xmath14 is integrated over the measured @xmath2 range ( i.e. @xmath29 gev / c ) and scaled down by a factor of 3 .",
