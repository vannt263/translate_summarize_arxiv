    "since the first discoveries of teide 1 @xcite and gliese 229b @xcite in 1995 , the last two decades have witnessed a wealth of brown dwarf ( bd ) discoveries . in the archives",

    "it may be that these theories apply to different populations of bds formed under different environments . for comprehensive studies of the formation mechanism ,",
    "therefore , it is important to have bd samples detected by using various methods that are sensitive to different populations of bds .    due to the nature of detecting objects through their gravitational field rather than their radiation",
    ", microlensing experiments can enrich bd samples by detecting bds that are difficult to be detected by other methods such as old and thus faint or dark brown dwarfs .",
    "there have been discovery reports of various types of microlensing bds as listed in table 1 .",
    "these samples include an isolated bd @xcite , bd companions to faint stars @xcite , bds hosting planets @xcite , and a binary system of bds @xcite .    although rapidly increasing , the number of known microlensing bds is still limited due to the difficulties in detection .",
    "the most important obstacle comes from the difficulties in identifying the bd nature of the lens by measuring its mass . for general lensing events ,",
    "the only observable parameter related to the mass of the lens is the event time scale @xmath32 .",
    "however , the time scale results from the combination of the lens mass , distance , and relative lens - source speed , and thus the mass estimated from @xmath32 is highly degenerate .",
    "for the unique measurement of the mass , one needs to measure two additional quantities of the angular einstein radius @xmath0 and the lens parallax @xmath1 .",
    "the einstein radius is measured by detecting the effect of the finite source size on the lensing light curve . on the other hand ,",
    "the lens parallax can be measured by detecting long - term deviations in lensing light curves caused by the deviation of the lens - source relative motion from rectilinear due to the change of the observer s position induced by the orbital motion of the earth around the sun @xcite . with the measured @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the lens mass and distance are determined by @xmath33 respectively .",
    "here @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the parallax of the source star located at a distance @xmath36 @xcite .    for a lensing event produced by a single mass , finite - source effects can be detected only for rare cases of high - magnification events where the lens approaches the source star close enough to pass over the source star surface @xcite . the chance to measure",
    "the lens parallax is also very slim because events produced by low - mass bds tend to have short time scales while the earth s parallactic motion has long - term effects on lensing light curves .",
    "in contrast to single - lens events , the chance to measure lens masses is much higher for events produced by binary lenses .",
    "this is first because the majority of binary - lens events are involved with caustic crossings during which finite - source effects are important and thus the chance to measure @xmath0 is high @xcite .",
    "caustics represent the positions on the source plane at which a point - source magnification is infinite and they form a single or multiple closed curves of extended size . for a finite - source , the lensing magnification corresponds to the mean averaged over the source star surface and thus deviates from that of a point source .",
    "in addition , although masses of bds are small , binaries including bds can be massive and thus events can have time scales long enough for one to measure @xmath1 . as a result , most known microlensing bds were detected through the channel of binary - lens events , e.g. @xcite .",
    "another difficulty of microlensing bd detection comes from the fact that bd signals in the lensing light curve do not have distinctive features . for a binary lens with an extreme companion / primary mass ratio @xmath37 like a planet - star pair , the caustic induced by",
    "the companion is very tiny and the signal of the companion appears as a distinctive short - term anomaly that is superposed on the smooth and symmetric lensing light curve of the primary @xcite . for bd companions with mass ratios @xmath38 , the size of the induced caustic can be as large as those induced by roughly equal - mass binaries . as a result ,",
    "it is difficult to immediately notice that the mass of the companion is in the regime of bds and thus identifying bd companions requires complex procedure of modeling observed light curves .    in this paper , we report the discovery of a bd that is bound to a low - mass star .",
    "the bd nature of the companion is identified from the mass measurement , which is possible due to the resolution of a very short - term caustic crossing combined with the detection of a subtle long - term deviation in the lensing light curve induced by the earth s orbital motion .",
    "the binary system was detected from the observation of a microlensing event ogle-2014-blg-0257 .",
    "the event occurred on a star that lies toward the galactic bulge field with equatorial and galactic coordinates @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . the lensing - induced brightening of the star was first noticed in april , 2014 by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle - iv : * ? ? ? * ) survey that is conducted using the 1.3-m warsaw telescope located at the las campanas observatory in chile . in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we present the event light curve which shows a typical binary - lensing feature of caustic - crossing spikes with a  u-shaped trough between them .",
    "there also exist two bumps that occurred before and after the caustic crossings .    with the progress of the event",
    ", it was noticed that the magnification of the lensed star ( source ) flux was high . since high - magnification events are sensitive to planetary companions to lenses @xcite , a second alert was issued to the microlensing community on april , 18 ( @xmath41 ) for intensive follow - up observation . on april 23 ( @xmath42 ) ,",
    "a strong anomaly from a single lensing light curve was detected .",
    "such an anomaly is usually associated with a caustic formed by a binary lens .",
    "caustics form closed curves and thus caustic crossings of a source star occur in pairs , i.e. caustic entrance and exit .",
    "since resolving caustic crossings is important to detect finite - source effects and thus to measure the einstein radius of the lens , another alert was issued . despite the successive alerts ,",
    "immediate follow - up observation could not be done since the anomaly occurred during the early bulge season when the time window of the bulge visibility was narrow and thus telescopes for follow - up observations were not fully operational .",
    "fortunately , the source star was located in the field toward which stars were monitored with a very high cadence ( @xmath43 ) and thus the caustic exit was densely resolved despite the short duration ( @xmath44 hours ) of the caustic crossing .",
    "see the inset in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : one ] , for the enlarged caustic - crossing part of the light curve .",
    "after the caustic exit , there was another bump induced by the source star s approach close to a cusp of the caustic . from the analyses of the light curve conducted after the second bump , it was noticed that the mass ratio between the binary lens components is @xmath38  0.2 , indicating that the mass of the companion is very low . from continued analyses conducted with the progress of the event",
    ", it was also noticed that long - term higher - order effects were needed to precisely describe the observed light curve .",
    "the event lasted for about @xmath45 months before it returned to its baseline magnitude @xmath46 .    in the analysis ,",
    "we use 8031 ogle @xmath47-band data points and 107 @xmath48-band data points .",
    "photometry of data were conducted by using the customized pipeline @xcite that is based on the difference imaging analysis code developed by @xcite . for the use of analysis",
    ", we readjust the flux measurement uncertainties of each data set by first adding a quadratic term to make the cumulative @xmath49 distribution ordered by magnifications approximately linear and then rescaling the uncertainties so that @xmath49 per degree of freedom ( dof ) becomes unity for the best - fit model .",

    ", we use the center of mass of the binary lens .",
    "two other parameters describe the binary lens : @xmath71 is the projected separation normalized to @xmath0 , and @xmath37 is the mass ratio of the lens components .",
    "the last basic parameter , @xmath89 , is the source radius normalized to @xmath0 .",
    "the normalized source radius is needed to describe the caustic - crossing part of the light curve that is affected by finite - source effects .",
    "the basic features of binary lensing light curves are determined by the size and shape of the caustic , which depends on @xmath71 and @xmath37 , and the source trajectory with respect to the caustic , which depends on @xmath83 . in the initial modeling run ,",
    "we therefore explore the @xmath116 parameter space by conducting a grid search , while the other parameters are searched for by minimizing @xmath49 . for the @xmath49 minimization",
    ", we use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method . from a @xmath49 map in the @xmath116 space obtained from this initial run ,",
    "we identify the approximate locations of the local minima .",
    "we then perform a @xmath49 optimization using all parameters at each local minima and refine the solution .",
    "finally , we identify a global minimum by comparing @xmath49 values of the individual local minima .",
    "the grid search is important to identify the existence of degenerate solutions which result in similar light curves despite the combinations of dramatically different parameters .    for the computation of finite - source lensing magnifications around the caustic crossings , we use the numerical ray - shooting method .",
    "in this process , we consider limb - darkening effects of the source star by modeling its surface brightness profiles as @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the linear limb - darkening coefficient and @xmath119 is the angle between the light of sight toward the center of the source and the normal to the source surface @xcite . from the de - reddened color and brightness ,",
    "we find that the source is an f - type main sequence ( see section 4 for more details ) and adopt a limb - darkening coefficient @xmath120 from the catalog of @xcite . in the grid search",
    ", we use the map - making method @xcite , where a magnification map for a given @xmath121 is constructed to produce many light curves resulting from different source trajectories .",
    "we identify two local minima in the close ( @xmath122 ) and wide ( @xmath123 ) binary regimes resulting from the well known close / wide binary degeneracy @xcite .",
    "however , the degeneracy is not severe and the close binary solution provides a better fit with a significant confidence level ( @xmath124 ) . from the modeling run based on the basic parameters ( standard model ) , we find that the event was produced by a close binary with a projected separation @xmath125 and a mass ratio @xmath126 .",
    "although the standard model explains the main features of the light curve , it is found that there exist noticeable residuals lasting for @xmath127 days from the first bump through the caustic - crossing feature to the second bump .",
    "see the residual from the standard model at the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : one ] .",
    "these residuals may indicate the need to consider higher - order effects .",
    "it is known that such a continuous deviation can be caused by either the orbital motion of the earth around the sun (  parallax effect ",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or the change of the lens position caused by the orbital motion of the lens (  lens orbital effect  : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to check these higher - order effects , we test additional models . in the `` parallax '' and `` orbital '' models , we consider the parallax and lens - orbital effects , respectively . in the `` orbital+parallax '' model , we consider both higher - order effects .",
    "consideration of the parallax effect requires to include two additional parameters @xmath97 and @xmath102 , that are the two components of the lens parallax vector @xmath128 projected onto the sky along the north and east equatorial coordinates , respectively . to first - order approximation ,",
    "the lens - orbital effects are described by two parameters @xmath107 and @xmath112 , that are the change rates of the projected binary separation and the source trajectory angle , respectively .",
    "we measure the parallax parameters with respect to the reference time that coincides with @xmath50 .",
    "it is known that a pair of parallax solutions with @xmath129 and @xmath130 result in similar light curves due to the mirror symmetry of the source trajectory with respect to the binary axis @xcite .",
    "this so - call `` ecliptic degeneracy '' is important especially for events that occur on source stars located near the ecliptic plane .",
    "the source star of ogle-2014-blg-0257 is located just @xmath131 away from the ecliptic plane and thus this degeneracy might be important .",
    "we therefore consider both @xmath129 and @xmath130 solutions whenever we consider parallax effects .",
    "we note that the pair of the two solutions resulting from the ecliptic degeneracy have similar lensing parameters except for the opposite signs of @xmath57 , @xmath83 , @xmath97 , and @xmath112 .    in table",
    "[ table : two ] , we present solutions of the lensing parameters for the tested models along with the @xmath49 values of the fits .",
    "the uncertainties of the individual parameters are estimated based on the distributions of points on the mcmc chain .",
    "it is found that the higher - order effects significantly improve the fit .",
    "when the parallax and orbital effects are separately considered , the fit improves by @xmath132 and 1035.0 , respectively , compared to the standard model .",
    "when both effects are simultaneously considered , the improvement is @xmath133 .",
    "see the decrease of the residual for the individual models presented in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : one ] .",
    "considering that ( 1 ) the improvement by the parallax effect is significantly greater than the orbital effect and ( 2 ) the @xmath49 difference between the parallax - only and parallax+orbital models ( @xmath134 ) is minor , we judge that the parallax effect plays a dominant role in the fit improvement . in figure",
    "[ fig : two ] , we present the cumulative distribution of @xmath135 of the best - fit model ( orbit+parallax model ) with respect to the standard model .",
    "it shows that the improvement occur during the major anomalies of the bumps and caustic - crossing features .",
    "we find that the two solutions caused by the ecliptic degeneracy is quite severe although the @xmath129 solution is preferred over the @xmath130 solution by @xmath136 .",
    "since this level of @xmath135 can often be ascribed to systematics in data , one can not completely rule out the @xmath130 solution .",
    "however , we note that the lensing parameters of the two solutions are similar except for the signs , and thus the estimated physical parameters are also similar to each other .",
    "figure  [ fig : three ] shows the geometry of the lens event , where we mark the locations of the binary - lens components ( @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) , the caustic , and the source trajectory with respect to the caustic .",
    "we note that the positions of the lens components and the caustic vary in time due to the orbital motion of the binary lens and thus we present locations at three different times that are marked in the panel .",
    "it is found that a four - cusp central caustic of a close binary lens is responsible for the anomalous features in the lensing light curve .",
    "the spikes were produced by the passage of the source trajectory through the caustic and the two bumps were produced by the approach of the source close to the cusps of the caustic before and after the caustic crossing .",
    "considering that only a curved source trajectory can approach both cusps close enough to produce the two strong bumps , the clear detection of the parallax effect was possible because of the good coverage of the major anomalies .",
    "the usefulness of triple - peak ( one caustic crossing plus two cusp approaches ) events in measuring the lens parallax was pointed out by @xcite .",
    "among the two quantities needed for the lens mass measurement , the lens parallax is measured from modeling .",
    "the einstein radius is determined from the combination of the normalized source radius measured from modeling and the angular source radius @xmath139 by @xmath140 .",
    "we estimate the @xmath139 from the de - reddened color @xmath141 and brightness @xmath142 of the source star . to measure the color and brightness , we first locate the source star in the instrumental color - magnitude diagram of neighboring stars in the same field and then calibrate the color and brightness by using the centroid of the giant clump ( gc ) as a reference @xcite .",
    "the gc centroid can be used as a standard candle because its de - reddened color and brightness , @xmath143 @xcite , are known .",
    "figure  [ fig : four ] shows the locations of the source and gc centroid in the instrumental color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the measured offsets in color and magnitude between the source and the gc are @xmath144 , @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "then , the estimated de - reddened color and the brightness of the source star are @xmath146 , respectively , indicating that the source is a mid f - type main sequence .",
    "we then convert the estimated @xmath141 into @xmath147 using the color - color relation of @xcite and finally determine @xmath139 using the color - angular radius relation of @xcite .",
    "we find that the angular radius of the source star is @xmath148 .",
    "then the angular einstein radius corresponding to the best - fit model ( orbital+parallax model with @xmath129 ) is @xmath149 combined with the einstein time scale estimated from lens modeling , the relative lens - source proper motion is determined as @xmath150 we note that the values of @xmath0 and @xmath151 are very similar for the @xmath130 solution due to the similarity in the measured parameters of @xmath89 and @xmath32 .",

    "it is known that long - term deviations in lensing light curves can also be produced by the orbital motion of the source star because it is possible for the source orbital motion to mimic parallax effects @xcite .",
    "this effect is often referred to as `` xallarap effect '' , where xallarap is parallax spelled in reverse .",
    "we investigate whether the observed long - term deviation can be explained by xallarap effects rather than parallax effects .    in order to consider xallarap effects , one need 5 additional parameters .",
    "these parameters include the orbital period @xmath174 , the phase angle and inclination of the orbit , and the north and east components of the xallarap vector , @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "see details about the parameters in @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the xallarap vector @xmath177 corresponds to the major axis of the orbit with respect to the center of mass , @xmath178 , normalized to the projected einstein radius onto the source plane , @xmath179 , i.e. @xmath180 where @xmath36 is the distance to the source .",
    "the value @xmath178 is related to the semi - major axis of the orbit by @xmath181 , where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are the masses of the binary source components . with equation  ( [ eqa1 ] )",
    "combined with the kepler s third law , the mass of the source companion is expressed in terms of @xmath184 as @xmath185 where mass , period , and distance are expressed in @xmath186 , yr , and au , respectively . from the fact that @xmath187 , then the the lower mass limit of the source companion is expressed as @xmath188    in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : a1 ] , we present the distribution of @xmath49 with respect to the orbital period . in the lower panel ,",
    "we also present the distribution of the lower mass limit of the source companion estimated by the relation ( [ eqa3 ] ) . from the @xmath49 distribution",
    ", it is found that the best xallarap solution provides a fit that is worse than the best orbital + parallax solution by @xmath189 , which is statistically important .",
    "furthermore , the estimated minimum mass of the source companion for the best - fit xallarap solution is @xmath190 , implying that the solution is physically unlikely .",
    "therefore , we conclude that xallarap effects can not explain the observed parallax signal ."
