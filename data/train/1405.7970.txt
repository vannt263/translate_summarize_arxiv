    "several studies have contributed to show the importance of black hole rotation in agn jet formation .",
    "agn jet classification mainly relies on orientation effects and relativistic doppler boosting .",

    "there are two main theories to interpret the different characteristics of radio loud and radio quiet galaxies .",
    "the morphological differences may be explained by the different physical properties of the environment in which the relativistic jet propagates @xcite .",
    "the dichotomy can also be explained by involving a difference in the nature of the central engine , the spin of the central black hole , the accretion rate and the jet composition @xcite .",
    "the discovery of two sub - classes of frii galaxies does not allow to solve the problem of the dichotomy .",
    "the hybrid morphology radio sources have two radio lobes which exhibit a different fr morphology and can not be explained without external medium or jet power differences between the two sides of the host galaxy @xcite . in double - double radio galaxies",
    "multiple pairs of lobes are seen and are interpreted as different episodes of jet activity @xcite leading to the possibility that jet interruption occurs in radio galaxies .",
    "finally , a combination of external and engine factors has to be invoked to explain the fri / frii dichotomy , as we have suggested in @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we could not study the effect of the black hole spin because the analytical model was based on a schwarzschild metric .    the dichotomy between radio loud and radio quiet sources",
    "has a result of the spin of the black hole has been explored analytically and numerically @xcite .",
    "moreoever @xcite have recently demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between the power of the jet and the spin of the black hole .",
    "the spin of the black hole may also explain the high precession that is observed in some jets @xcite .",
    "in fact , as already suggested by @xcite , the rotational energy of the central black hole is a tremendous spring for energy invoked to explain emission of plasma flows .",
    "they were the first to propose a magnetospheric model in the force free limit as a source for extracting rotational energy from the black hole .",
    "this model has been extensively discussed in the frame of ideal mhd @xcite .",
    "the energy extracted under the form of poynting flux depends on the rotational speed of the magnetic fieldlines , the spin of the black hole , and as shown recently by @xcite , on plasma injection on magnetic field lines .",
    "other 1d models allowed to study force free magnetospheres around black holes , first in schwarzschild metrics by @xcite and in kerr metrics by @xcite , with a more complexe magnetic configuration and taking into account the connexion between the magnetosphere and the accretion disk .",
    "this last study shows that the higher the black hole spin the smaller the magnetic dead zone of the magnetosphere .",
    "s. komissarov was the first to perform numerical simulations of the blandford znajek scenario @xcite .",
    "besides the strong acceleration that they undergo , agn outflows appear to be highly collimated .",
    "the question we want to address is whether there is a correlation between the collimation of the jets and the black hole spin .",
    "we propose a model for a rotating black hole based on our previous steady axisymmetric analytical model @xcite .",
    "the problem of collimation in all its complexity must include the interaction between the jet and the external medium ( see e.g. levinson & begelman @xcite , and references therein ) . in the following ,",
    "we focus on the self - collimation processes where it is the combination of gas pressure and magnetic fields that acts to confine the flow , as illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "magnetic - self confinement requiere an ordered magnetic field anchored onto the black hole or the inner disk region .",
    "the poloidal component of the lorentz force has a collimating effect @xcite .",

    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the complete set of 3 + 1 equations is given by @xcite in schwarzschild geometry .",
    "we compile in sect.[equations ] the complete set in kerr geometry and obtain an original formulation of the energy and momentum equations . in sect.[model ]",
    "we present the mathematical formalism and the assumptions leading to the self - similar model , an extension of the non relativistic meridionnaly self- similar model @xcite to the case of relativistic jets around rotating black holes . in sect.[results ] we present the collimation criterion established by @xcite extended to this metric and show that the rotation of the black hole induces a more efficient magnetic collimation of the jet .",
    "the common picture for the structure of relativitic jets is the two - component model @xcite , where a relativistic @xmath2 plasma is accelerated in the polar region of the central black hole and is surrounded by a baryonic component coming from the accretion disk . in agn ,",
    "pair injection in the black hole magnetosphere may arise from annihilation of mev photons if the accretion rates are sufficient , or from pair cascades induced by a potential drop in charge - starved regions @xcite . when the jet is emitted in the region very close to the central engine",
    ", frame - dragging effects may play an important role on self - collimation processes . to adress this question we therefore need to model the inner part of the jet close to the polar axis .",
    "the dynamics and the geometry of a magnetized , relativistic plasma flow around a rotating black hole are described by exact solutions to the general relativistic mhd equations in the kerr metric .",
    "a standard treatment to reduce the stationnary and axisymmetric grmhd equations to a system of ordinary differential equations is to adopt a self - similar geometry _",
    "i.e. _ to make the assumption of a scaling law of one of the variable as function of one of the coordinates ( see @xcite for a general classification of self - similar models ) .",
    "analytical solutions using radial self - similarity have been derived from grmhd equations in order to model disk winds @xcite .",
    "however those models fail to describe the regions close to the rotational axis .",
    "a meridional self - similar treatment ( i.e. , similar in the @xmath0-direction ) is necessary to model the spine jet where the outflow is rather driven by the thermal pressure . in those models , the @xmath0-dependence is prescribed _ a priori _ while the radial dependence is derived from the mhd equations .",
    "this modeling does not require the use of a polytropic equation of state .",

    "outflow solutions are super - alfvnic , and one class of the solutions provides self - confined jets @xcite .",
    "this model has been extended to the general relativistic case in the schwarzschild geometry @xcite and applied to agn jets .",
    "the collimation of the relativistic solutions results from the distribution of the total electromagnetic energy across the jet , as compared to the corresponding distribution of the thermal and gravitational energies .",
    "the fri / frii dichotomy was explained by the magnetic rotator efficiency @xcite . in this paper , we extend the model to the kerr geometry to study the effect of frame - dragging on jet collimation .",
    "the kerr metric is axisymmetric and hence adapted to this assumption . in the following , we make a taylor expansion of all physical quantities with small @xmath0 .",
    "such a treatment allows to study the physical properties of the outflow close to its rotational axis but does not imply any restriction on the black hole rotation going from zero to maximum value .",

    "we found that the magnetic collimation efficiency is enhanced by the rotation of the black hole , and increases linearly with the black hole spin in our model .",
    "this gain is due ( i ) to the fact that the volumetric gravitational energy @xmath166 , which has a negative contribution to the collimation efficiency , is smaller in the kerr metric , and ( ii ) to the presence of the new term @xmath168 , associated with the frame - dragging . as our model is valid only for small colatitude angles ,",
