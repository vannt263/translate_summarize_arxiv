    "despite the efforts of murdoch  @xcite , harrison  @xcite , stuckey  @xcite , ellis & rothman  @xcite and kiang  @xcite there is much confusion about superluminal recession in the literature  @xcite .",
    "special relativistic calculations are often incorrectly invoked in a cosmological context and recession velocities with an upper limit of c are obtained .",
    "a common , but mistaken line of reasoning goes as follows : * 1 .",
    "* the most distant object we can observe has an infinite redshift . * 2 . *",
    "an infinite redshift implies a velocity equal to the speed of light . *",
    "therefore the most distant object we can see has a velocity of @xmath2 .",
    "this logic falters because the second premise is invalid : ( * 2 .",
    "* ) would only be true if the cosmological redshift were a special relativistic rather than a general relativistic effect .",
    "since redshifts and recession velocities are central to the idea of an expanding universe , the distinction between recession and peculiar velocity is fundamental .",
    "we define the velocities and redshifts mentioned above and present spacetime diagrams showing how light can reach us from regions of space which are receding superluminally .",
    "we have generalised the solutions to arbitrary @xmath3 .",
    "the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric  @xcite describes an homogeneous , isotropic universe .",
    "we are interested in only the radial components : @xmath4 .",
    "radial distance along a constant time slice ( @xmath5 ) is given by : @xmath6 .",
    "differentiating this physical or proper distance gives a two component velocity : @xmath7 recession velocity ( @xmath8 ) is the velocity in hubble s law since hubble s constant @xmath9 .",
    "peculiar velocity ( @xmath10 ) is unassociated with the expansion of the universe and corresponds more closely to common usage of the word ` velocity ' .",
    "for example setting @xmath11 for a photon in the frw metric gives a radial peculiar velocity @xmath12 .",
    "the conversion from cosmological redshift to recession velocity is different from the conversion from an sr doppler shift to peculiar velocity ( fig .",
    "[ f : tdavis : fig1 ] ) : @xmath13 equation ( [ e : tdavis : gr ] ) converts high redshifts into superluminal recession velocities but does not contradict special relativity because nothing ever overtakes a photon and all observers measure local photons to be traveling at @xmath2 .    in figure  [ f : tdavis : fig2 ] the boundary between the light and dark grey regions is the hubble sphere , the distance , @xmath14 , at which galaxies are receding at the speed of light . the comoving distance to the hubble sphere increases when the universe decelerates and decreases when the universe accelerates . the hubble sphere is not an horizon of any kind ; it passes over particles and photons in both directions .",
    "how can photons move from the light grey superluminal region into the dark grey subluminal region ?",
    "how can a swimmer make headway against a current that is faster than she can swim ?",
    "it seems impossible .",
    "first consider the problem in comoving coordinates .",
    "photons propagate towards us along our trumpet - shaped past lightcone with a comoving velocity @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , photons move inexorably through comoving space , irrespective of their position in relation to our hubble sphere .",
    "their comoving velocity is always negative",
    ". their comoving distance always decreases .",
    "now consider the problem in physical space .",
    "the tear - drop shape of our past lightcone means that the distance between us and the most distant photons we now see , was once increasing .",
    "the relevant quantity for understanding this behaviour is the total velocity of a photon that is heading towards us : @xmath16 .",
    "the total velocity of distant photons is not constant because it is the sum of the distance - dependent recession velocity ( @xmath8 ) and the constant peculiar velocity , @xmath2 . when @xmath17 the distance between us and the photon increases .",
    "photons now reaching us from our particle horizon were emitted at the big bang .",
    "since @xmath18 in all viable cosmological models , @xmath17 would have been satisfied and these photons would have inially receded from us .",
    "similarly , the first photon we receive from _ any _ object was emitted from a region with @xmath19 , @xmath20 . in the early universe as time progresses , both @xmath21 and @xmath22 decrease .",
    "thus , @xmath23 of these photons evolves from positive to negative , and the teardrop shape of our physical past lightcone is ubiquitous to all times .",
    "the swimming analogy fails because , unlike recession velocity which is smaller at smaller comoving distances , the current the swimmer has to face is the _ same _ at all comoving distances .",
    "our swimmer has to battle an unrelenting cur rent , while the photon constantly moves into regions with a slower `` current '' ( slower @xmath8 ) .",

    "<S> @xmath0 applies at least as far as the particle horizon and in principle for all distances . </S>",
    "<S> thus , galaxies with distances greater than @xmath1 are receding from us with velocities greater than the speed of light and superluminal recession is a fundamental part of the general relativistic description of the expanding universe . </S>",
    "<S> this apparent contradiction of special relativity ( sr ) is often mistakenly remedied by converting redshift to velocity using sr . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that galaxies with recession velocities faster than the speed of light are observable and that in all viable cosmological models , galaxies above a redshift of three are receding superluminally . </S>"
