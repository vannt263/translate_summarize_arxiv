    "astronomical factors and differences of local albedo cause a difference of net incoming shortwave radiation between low and high latitudes leading to differential heating and a surplus of energy in the tropics . considering global and long - term averages , at steady - state the same amount of supplied energy is emitted to space again , and the incoming shortwave radiation is balanced by the outgoing longwave radiation ( peixoto and oort 1992 , lucarini and ragone , 2011 ) .",
    "atmospheric and oceanic transports , fuelled by instabilities due to the presence of temperature differences related to inhomogeneous heating , tend to reduce such temperature differences , thus acting as a powerful negative feedback that stabilizes the climate system .",
    "stone ( 1978 ) argued that the magnitude of the total meridional heat transport , i.e. the sum of the oceanic and the atmospheric contributions , is insensitive to the structure and the specific dynamical properties of the atmosphere - ocean system .",
    "that is , changes of the oceanic heat transport ( oht ) will be compensated by the atmospheric flow and vice versa . in particular",
    ", he suggested that the peak of the heat transport is constrained within a narrow range of latitudes regardless of the radiative forcing .",
    "if the climate system is at steady - state , the features of the meridional heat transport can be related to the solar constant , the radius of the earth , the tilt of the earth s axis and the hemispheric mean albedo .",
    "stone argued that the insensitivity to the structure and the dynamics of the system is due to the correlation of thermal emissions to space , the albedo and the efficiency of the transport mechanisms of the atmosphere and the ocean .",
    "enderton and marshall ( 2008 ) discussed the limits of stone s hypothesis by employing a series of coupled atmosphere - ocean - sea ice model experiments in which the oceanic circulation on an aqua - planet is constrained by different meridional barriers . the presence or absence of the barriers results in significant different climates , in particular in climates with and without polar ice caps .",
    "they concluded that stone s result is a good guide for ice free climates .",
    "but , if polar ice caps are present the effect of the related meridional gradients in albedo on the absorption of solar radiation need to be taken into account .",
    "the atmospheric compensation implies a significant impact of changes in oht on the atmospheric circulation as a whole which affects the zonally symmetric flow , the zonally asymmetric ( eddy ) flow and the interplay between both .",
    "thus , changes in oht have been commonly used to account for paleo - climatic changes ( e.g. rind and chandler 1991 , sloan et al .",
    "2001 , romanova et al . 2006 ) .",
    "moreover , oht is an important factor for a potential anthropogenic climate change since significant modifications of it can expected .",
    "unfortunately , large uncertainties exist of changes in the oceanic circulation simulated in climate change scenarios ( ipcc 2013 ) .",
    "these result from , amongst others , the uncertainties in fresh water forcing due to potential melting of inland ice sheets . to assess the role of the ocean for historical and potential future climates the impact of the oht on the atmospheric circulation and the underlying mechanisms need to be investigated systematically .    a way of studying the impact of changes in oht on the atmospheric circulation is to utilize an atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a mixed - layer ocean .",

    "utilizing an idealized aqua - planet setup rose and ferreira ( 2013 ) systematically assessed the impact of the oht on the atmospheric global mean near surface temperature and its equator - to - pole gradient . for warm and ice - free climates",
    "they confirm a near - perfect atmospheric compensation of the imposed changes in oht . like in the above studies including continents , they found they found an increase in global mean temperature for increasing oht , accompanied by a decrease in the equator - to - pole temperature gradient .",
    "tropical ssts showed to be less affected than higher altitudes .",
    "the detailed meridional structure of the oceanic heat transport turned out to be less important .",

    "koll and abbot ( 2013 ) confirmed the low sensitivity of tropical ssts to oht changes . in their aqua - planet experiments",

    "we solve the kuo - eliassen equation for @xmath29 by applying an iterative method ( gauss - seidel method ) to its finite difference approximation .",
    "thus , we are able to diagnose the contributions from the different sources to the mean meridional circulation , which are diabatic heating ( 1@xmath37 term r.h.s ) , friction ( 2@xmath38 ) , meridional eddy heat transport ( 3@xmath39 ) and eddy momentum transport ( 4@xmath40 ) .",
    "we note that though the equation , in the present form , involves the quasi - geostrophic approximation it has shown to be reasonably applicable even in the deep tropics ( kim and lee 2001a , b ) .",
    "before discussing the impact of changes in oht on the lorenz energy cycle and the mean meridional circulation we present the effect on the mean climate in terms of the total meridional heat transport and the atmospheric near surface ( 2 m ) temperature .",
    "first we note that similar to rose and ferreira our model exhibits multiple equilibria , a warm state and a snow ball earth depending on the initial conditions as thoroughly discussed in boschi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . in the present study",
    "we investigate the warm states only .",
    "however , in contrast to rose and ferreira sea ice at high latitudes is present in those warm state in all simulations . despite the difference in sea ice extend (",
    "i.e. planetary albedo ) the atmospheric heat transport compensates the changes in oht to a great extend as can be seen from the total meridional heat transport diagnosed from the energy budged at the top of the atmosphere ( figure [ fig : tht ] ) .",
    "up to about oht@xmath9=2.5pw increasing oht leads to an increase of the global mean ( @xmath41 ) and a decrease of the equator - to - pole gradient ( @xmath42 ) of the annual and zonal mean near surface air temperature ( figure [ fig : t2m+tmdt ] ) .",
    "for this regime an approximately linear relationship between @xmath43 and @xmath42 can be found .",
    "for oht@xmath9>2.5pw , @xmath41 is almost insensitive to an oht change while @xmath42 is further reduced when stronger ohts are considered . here , the equator - to - pole gradient is defined by the difference between the values at the lowest and highest latitude of the models grid . inspecting the respective meridional profiles of the annual and zonal mean near surface temperatures we observe that high latitudes are more sensitive to the oht changes than low latitudes .",
    "with increasing oht the polar temperatures continuously increase except for oht@xmath9=4pw where slightly colder polar temperatures than for oht@xmath9=3.5pw are found .",
    "it appears that this is a consequence of the reduced atmospheric heat transport slightly over - compensating the increased but still small oceanic heat transport at these latitudes . in the tropics ,",
    "an increase of the temperatures is only present until oht@xmath9=1.5pw . for larger oht the equatorial temperatures decrease .",
    "in addition , increasing oht leads to a flattening of the temperature profile in the tropics until , for oht oht@xmath9=3.5 and 4pw , the temperature gradient in the tropics gets reversed and the maximum of the temperature shifts away from the equator to approx .",
    "qualitatively , all findings are also true for winter and summer as can be seen in figures [ fig : t2mjja ] , except that in summer the sensitivity to oht changes is small in high latitudes which are covered by sea ice .",
    "in addition we note that the seasonality and its sensitivity to oht changes are small for latitudes without sea ice due to the high thermal inertia of the mixed layer .",
    "we compute the climatological average lorenz energy cycle from 30 year daily data for the entire year and for june - august showing the respective terms for the winter ( northern ) and the summer ( southern ) hemisphere separately ( figure [ fig : lorenz ] ) .",
    "we note that by using the equations given in section [ sec : lorenz ] the computed averaged values include contributions from the annual cycle . this",
    ", however , only affects the annual values of the reservoirs @xmath14 and @xmath16 , and of the conversion @xmath45 .",
    "using annual averaged values would diminish the annual @xmath14 , @xmath16 and @xmath45 by about 50% each .",
    "the monotonic but nonlinear decrease of the global mean zonal averaged temperature gradient with increasing oht which is present throughout the troposphere is reflected in the mean flow available potential energy @xmath14 ( figures [ fig : lorenz]a , c , e ) .",
    "compared to the oht@xmath9=0pw simulation , @xmath14 is reduced by about 71% in the oht@xmath9=4pw run for yearly values , 73% for the winter and 67% for the summer hemisphere . a decrease with increasing oht",
    "can also be detected for all other reservoirs .",
    "however , here the relative decrease for @xmath15 and @xmath16 is substantially smaller for the summer ( approx .",
    "48% and 59% , resp . ) than for the winter hemisphere ( approx .  77% and 72% ) .",
    "the yearly values reduced by approx .",
    "69% and 65% .",
    "@xmath17 declines by about 54% for the yearly data and for both hemispheres , thus showing by far the smallest decrease of all reservoirs on the winter hemisphere .",
    "the overall decline in the reservoirs with increasing oht is also present for conversion terms which are mainly related to the activity of baroclinic synoptic eddies , i.e. @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( figures [ fig : lorenz]b , d , f ) . here",
    ", the largest changes occur in winter where baroclincity ( i.e. the temperature gradient ) is reduced most",
    ". however , the sensitivity appears to decrease following the sequence of a baroclinic live cycle . while @xmath46 show the largest sensitivity ( approx .  65% , 70% and 47% for annual , winter and summer , resp .",
    ") , the changes in @xmath48 are the smallest ( approx .  53% , 59% and 34% ) .",
    "the changes in @xmath47 amount to approx .  57% , 61% and 44%,respectively .",
    "the convergences of the conversions with increasing oht indicate that zonally asymmetric diabatic heating and friction become less important for the lorenz energy cycle .",
    "we note that in the present simulations the zonally asymmetric heating extracts @xmath15 , i.e.  it acts to homogenize the zonal temperature profiles . for oht@xmath9>4pw",
    "there is almost no contribution of zonally asymmetric diabatic heating similar to the summer hemisphere in all simulations .",
    "@xmath45 exhibits the smallest sensitivity . for the summer hemisphere , a decrease with increasing oht can be found indicating that the thermally indirect zonal mean circulation ( ferrel cell ) becomes more important compared to the thermally direct one ( hadley cell ) .",
    "for the winter hemisphere , the thermally direct mean circulation dominates in all simulations but with slightly decreasing magnitude . on annual basis little changes in @xmath45 are found .    in summary ,",
    "an increase in oht leads to a decrease in all components of the lorenz energy cycle .",
    "this suggests that the atmosphere gets less active and less efficient .",
    "we note that the strength of the lorenz energy cycle can be linked to a carnot efficiency of the climate system ( lucarini 2009 ) .",
    "indeed , this efficiency declines with increasing oht . a study on this efficiency , and on other global thermodynamic properties , will be presented in a companion paper .",
    "it turns out that changes in the intensity of the water vapor transport are most relevant , similar to lucarini et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .      for discussing the changes in the mean meridional circulation we focus on the climatological annual average of the zonal mean mass stream function ( @xmath29 )",
    ". however , if not stated otherwise , the results are qualitatively similar for all seasons .",
    "figure [ fig : mmc ] shows northern hemisphere @xmath29 for oht@xmath9=0 , 2 , 3 and 4pw . for oht@xmath9=0pw , a hadley cell and a ferrel cell are well established with values of about 8@xmath4910@xmath50 kg s@xmath51 and -3@xmath4910@xmath50 kg s@xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the maximum magnitudes are located at about 10@xmath8n for the hadley cell and 50@xmath8n for the ferrel cell , and at about 700hpa for both cells .",
    "the hadley cell extends to about 33@xmath8n .",
    "a polar cell is absent in the annual mean but emerges weakly in the summer months .    with increasing oht",
    "the strength of both cells decreases ( figure [ fig : hfc ] ) .",
    "however , while the strength of the hadley cell is virtually linear and amounts to about 85% , the ferrel cell strength decreases by about 50% only with stronger decrease for smaller oht@xmath9 .",
    "in addition to the changes in strength , the ferrel cell shifts poleward .",
    "for oht@xmath9>2pw a poleward shift can also be observed for the hadley cells maximum together with a broadening of this cell , i.e.  a poleward shift of its edge . for oht@xmath9=4pw",
    "an additional thermally indirect cell can be observed close to the equator .",
    "this is related to an almost vanished hadley cell in summer together with a winter hemisphere hadley cell which has its maximum on the summer hemisphere .",
    "the reconstructions by means of the kuo - eliassen equation are in good agreement with the actual @xmath29 for all simulations even if the maximum magnitudes are somewhat overestimated .",
    "this gives us confidence to the applied methodology .",
    "figure [ fig : mmcr ] shows the sources and the reconstruction for oht@xmath9=0pw .",
    "the individual sources indicate that the largest contributions to @xmath29 stem from diabatic heating and from friction .",
    "the heating controls the hadley cell together with a significant contribution by friction . for",
    "the ferrel cell friction is most important . to a much smaller extent",
    "the eddy transports of heat and of momentum add to the ferrel circulation with a larger contribution by the heat transport .",
    "for both hadley and ferrel cell the maximum contribution by friction is located at lower levels than for all other sources .",
    "for the hadley cell both major sources , heating and friction , decrease linearly with increasing oht ( figure [ fig : mmcf ] ) . as the decrease is stronger for heating , friction becomes the major source for oht@xmath9>3pw .",
    "the decrease of the ferrel cell with increasing oht is linked to a decrease of the friction , i.h .",
    "a decrease of the near surface zonal mean zonal wind .",
    "the contributions by the heat and momentum transports decrease less and remain constant for oht@xmath9>2pw .",
    "similar to the changes of magnitude , the shifting of the cells and the broadening of the hadley cell can be explaind by respective changes in the mean sources .",
    "we have studied the impact of the oceanic heat transport ( oht ) on the atmospheric circulation focusing on the lorenz energy cycle and the mean meridional circulation . utilizing a general circulation model of intermediate complexity ( plasim ) which includes an oceanic mixed layer we have adopted an experimental design from rose and ferreira ( 2013 ) . here ,",
    "an imposed oceanic heat transport of simple analytic form and with varying strength allows for systematic analyses .",
    "the meridional circulation has been studied by means of the kuo - eliassen equations which separates contributions by different sources : diabatic heating , friction and the eddy transport of heat and momentum .",
    "we found a compensation of the changes in oceanic heat transport by the atmosphere confirming stones ( 1978 ) conclusions .",
    "the presence of sea ice may explain the deviations from a perfect compensation as discussed in enderton and marshall ( 2008 ) .",
    "in agreement with rose and ferreira we have found an increase of the global mean near surface temperature and a decrease of the equator - to - pole temperature gradient with increasing oht for oht@xmath9<3pw . for larger oht",
    "the temperature gradient is still decreasing but the global average remains constant . for the tropics , there is a significant decrease of both temperature and its gradient for oht@xmath9>2pw with a reversal of the gradient for oht@xmath9>3pw . for smaller oht",
    "we observed a slight warming and a reduction of the gradient with increasing oht which is consistent with results from koll and abbot ( 2013 ) .",
    "however , in their aqua - planet the tropical temperature increases for all imposed ( positive ) ohts ( up to 3pw ) .",
    "a tropical cooling for imposed oceanic heat transports somewhat larger than present - day values has also been found by barreiro et al .",
    "( 2011 ) in a more complex coupled atmosphere - slab ocean model with present - day land - sea distribution suggesting that present - day climate is close to a state were the warming effect of oht is maximized .",
    "barreiro et al .  related the tropical cooling to a strong cloud - sst feedback and showed that the results are sensitive to the particular parameterizations .    with respect to the lorenz energy cycle",
    ", the decline of the meridional temperature gradient with increasing oht is directly linked to a reduction of the available potential energy of the zonal mean flow ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "in addition , the reduced gradient indicates less baroclinicity as well as a weaker zonal mean zonal wind ( jet ) due to the the thermal wind relation . finally , less baroclinicity hint to a reduced eddy activity .",
    "thus , it is consistent that all reservoirs and conversions of the lorenz energy cycle decrease with increasing oht .",
    "however , the sensitivities differ . @xmath14 and the conversion from @xmath14 to @xmath15 exhibit the largest changes .",
    "eddy kinetic energy , the barotropic conversion from eddy kinetic energy to zonal mean kinetic energy , and the conversion from zonal mean kinetic energy to @xmath14 are least affected .",
    "confirming the results of previous studies ( herweijer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , barreiro et al . ,",
    "koll and abbot ) we have found a decrease of the hadley cell for increasing oht .",
    "in addition , the hadley cell broadens and its maximum shifts polward when oht obtains large values ( oht@xmath9>2.5pw ) . separating individual sources by applying",
    "the kuo - eliassen equation showed that the characteristics of the hadley cell can be explained by the mean meridional circulations related to the diabatic heating and , to a smaller extend , to the friction . in our simulations ,",
    "the meridional circulation induced by friction also controls the behavior of the ferrel cell .",
    "eddy transports of heat and momentum appear to be less important .",
    "this is different from results by kim and lee ( 2001b ) where the mean meridional circulation related to eddy fluxes account for about 50% of the ferrel cells strength .",
    "the coarse vertical resolution adopted from rose and ferreira may be responsible for a reduced eddy activity .",
    "overall our study demonstrate the large impact of the oceanic heat transport on the atmospheric circulation which effects the zonally symmetric flow , the zonally asymmetric flow and the interaction between both . by reducing the meridional temperature gradient an increased oceanic heat transport weakens the lorenz energy cycle and slows down and",
    "shifts the hadley and the ferrel cell .",
    "the reduction of the meridional gradient of the surface temperature is one of the major features of global warming .",
    "( 2007 ) showed a consistent weakening and poleward expansion of the hadley cell in ipcc ar4 simulations .",
    "hence , changes in the oceanic heat transport may significantly modify the response of the atmospheric circulation to greenhouse warming .",
    "a weakening of the oceanic meridional overturning circulation as predicted by the majority of coupled ocean - atmosphere general circulation models ( though with large uncertainties ; ipcc 2013 ) would therefor act as a negative feedback mechanism .",
    "this negative feedback might become even more important when strong melting of inland ice sheets due to global warming is taken into account .",
    "the associated input of large amounts of fresh water has a huge potential to slow down the oceanic circulation .",
    "finally , all changes discussed above can also be seen as a phenomenological fingerprint of modified global thermodynamic properties of the atmospheric flow like entropy production and an carnot efficiency ( lucarini 2009 ) . analysing these properties",
    "will provide a more general perspective in the context of geophysical fluid dynamics .",
