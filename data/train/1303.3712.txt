    "entanglement@xcite is an important physical resource in the context of quantum information theories@xcite .",
    "as shown for last two decades it plays a crucial role in quantum teleportation@xcite , superdense coding@xcite , quantum cloning@xcite , quantum cryptography@xcite .",
    "it is also quantum entanglement , which makes the quantum computer outperform the classical one@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is greatly important task to understand what kind and how much entanglement a given quantum state has .    for multipartite quantum states",
    "there are several types of entanglement .",
    "each type is in general categorized by stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc)@xcite .",
    "thus , these types of entanglement is often called slocc - equivalence classes . for example , for three - qubit pure states@xcite there are six slocc - equivalence classes such as separable , three bi - separable ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , w and greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) classes . among them",

    "this classification can be extended to three - qubit mixed states@xcite .",
    "following ref.@xcite the whole three - qubit mixed states are classified as separable ( s ) , bi - separable ( b ) , w and ghz classes .",
    "these classes satisfy a linear hierarchy s @xmath11 b @xmath11 w @xmath11 ghz .",
    "one remarkable fact , which was proved in this reference , is that the w - class is not of measure zero among all mixed - states .",
    "although slocc classes for three - qubit system are well - known , we still do not know how the entanglement is classified in multi - qubit system except four - qubit pure states , where there are nine slocc classes@xcite .",
    "furthermore , still it is very difficult problem to find a slocc class of a given three - qubit mixed state except few rare cases .",
    "thus , it is important task to develop a method , which enables us to find a slocc class of an arbitrary three - qubit states .",
    "recently , a significant progress is made in this issue . in ref.@xcite a complete slocc classification for the set of the ghz - symmetric states",
    "was reported ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . according to this complete classification the ratio of number of s , b , w , and ghz states in the whole set of the ghz - symmetric states is @xmath12 .",
    "thus , w class is not of measure zero in this restricted set of the three - qubit states . using this classification the three - tangle @xmath13 for the arbitrary ghz - symmetric states",
    "is explored in ref.@xcite . moreover , this complete classification is used to construct the class - specific optimal witnesses for the three - qubit entanglement@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore a possible extension of ref.@xcite to treat more three - qubit mixed states . for this purpose",
    "we enlarge the symmetry group to , so - called , the extended ghz symmetry group .",
    "the whole set of quantum states invariant under the extended ghz symmetry group is parametrized by four real parameters @xmath14 . the complete classification for s states",
    "is analytically derived .",
    "however , the classification for b , w , and ghz states is incomplete .",
    "rough classification for b , w , and ghz states is explored by making use of the class - specific optimal witnesses@xcite or ghz symmetry@xcite , respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we review ref .",
    "@xcite briefly . in section iii",
    "we discuss on the extended ghz symmetry .",

    "v we perform a entanglement classification of the extended ghz - symmetric states roughly by making use of the class - specific optimal witnesses or map from extended ghz symmetry to ghz symmetry . in section vi a conclusion is given .",

    "the ghz - symmetric states are the three - qubit states which are invariant under the following transformations : ( i ) qubit permutations , ( ii ) simultaneous three - qubit flips ( i.e. , application of @xmath15 ) , ( iii ) qubit rotations about the @xmath16-axis of the form @xmath17    it is straightforward to show that the general form of the ghz - symmetric states @xmath18 is parametrized by two real parameters @xmath1 and @xmath19 as @xmath20\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 the real parameters @xmath1 and @xmath19 are introduced such that the euclidean metric in the @xmath22 plane coincides with the hilbert - schmidt metric @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 since @xmath25 is a quantum state , the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath19 are restricted as @xmath26 this restriction can be easily derived by computing the eigenvalues of @xmath18 .",

    "each point inside the triangle corresponds to each ghz - symmetric state .        in order to classify the ghz - symmetric states it is worthwhile noting that there exists a map from an arbitrary three - qubit pure state @xmath27 to the ghz - symmetric state @xmath28 , which is defined as @xmath29 where the integral",

    "( [ ghz - general - form ] ) with @xmath31 another fact we will use for classification is that applying @xmath32 transformations to any qubit does not change the entanglement class of a multiqubit state .",

    "this procedure yields some region in the @xmath36 plane .",
    "if this region is a convex , the set of states corresponding to this region exhibits a same entanglement property .",
    "if it is not convex , the proper boundary of the class is obtained by the convex hull of this region .    the entanglement classification derived in this way",
    "is summarized in fig .",
    "1 . recently",
    ", this classification was used to compute the three - tangle@xcite of the entire ghz - symmetric states analytically@xcite .",

    "<S> in this paper we analyze entanglement classification of extended greenberger - horne - zeilinger - symmetric states @xmath0 , which is parametrized by four real parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition for separable states of @xmath0 is analytically derived . </S>",
    "<S> the higher classes such as bi - separable , w , and greenberger - horne - zeilinger classes are roughly classified by making use of the class - specific optimal witnesses or map from the extended greenberger - horne - zeilinger symmetry to the greenberger - horne - zeilinger symmetry . from this analysis we guess that the entanglement classes of @xmath0 are not dependent on @xmath5 individually , but dependent on @xmath6 collectively . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty arising in extension of analysis with greenberger - horne - zeilinger symmetry to the higher - qubit system is discussed . </S>"
