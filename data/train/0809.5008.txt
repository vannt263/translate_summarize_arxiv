    "multiple antenna communication has become a key component of virtually every contemporary high - rate wireless standard ( lte , 802.11n , wimax ) . the theoretical result that sparked the intense academic and industrial investigation of mimo ( multiple - input / multiple - output ) communication was the finding that the achievable throughput of a point - to - point mimo channel scales _ linearly _ with the minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas @xcite .",
    "linear scaling in the number of transmit antennas can also be achieved in point - to - multipoint ( broadcast / downlink ) channels @xcite even if each receiver has only a single antenna , or in the number of receive antennas in multipoint - to - point ( multiple access / uplink ) channels even if each transmitter has a single antenna @xcite . in these two cases ,",
    "the linear gains are enabled by the simultaneous transmission or reception of multiple data streams .      in this paper",
    "we are interested in the throughput gains that multiple antennas can provide in _ ad hoc networks _ , rather than in channels with a common transmitter and/or receiver .",
    "if multiple antennas are added at each node in the network and point - to - point mimo techniques are used to increase the rate of every individual link ( i.e. , every hop in a multi - hop route ) in the network , then network - wide throughput naturally increases linearly with the number of antennas per node .",
    "similarly , based on the quoted point - to - multipoint and multipoint - to - point mimo results , linear scaling is also expected to occur if nodes are capable of sending or receiving multiple streams .",
    "the main finding of this paper is that network - wide throughput can be increased linearly with the number of receive antennas , even if only a single transmit antenna is used by each node ( i.e. , single - input , multiple - output , or simo , communication ) , and each node sends and receives only a single data stream .",
    "furthermore , this gain is achievable using only linear receive processing and does not require any transmit channel state information ( csit ) .",
    "the main result is obtained by considering an ad hoc network in which transmitters are randomly located on the plane according to a 2-d homogeneous poisson point process with a particular spatial density .",
    "we consider a desired transmit - receive pair separated by a fixed distance , and experiencing interference ( assumed to be treated as noise ) from all other active transmitters .",
    "the received signal and interference are functions of path - loss attenuation and fading , and we assume that for a transmission to be successful , it must be detected with an sinr larger than a defined threshold @xmath1 .",
    "the primary performance metric is the maximum spatial density of transmitters / interferers that can be supported such that the outage probability @xmath2 $ ] is no larger than an outage constraint @xmath3 , and our particular interest is in quantifying how quickly this maximum density increases with the number of receive antennas @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 and @xmath3 fixed ) .",
    "if receive beamforming is performed , the receive degrees of freedom can be used to either increase the power of the desired signal ( i.e. , for array gain ) or suppress interference , and these competing objectives are optimally balanced by the sinr - maximizing mmse ( minimum mean - square error ) filter . using the mmse outage probability lower bound in @xcite , we develop an upper bound on the maximum density allowable with an mmse receiver . in conjunction",
    ", we develop a density lower bound by analyzing the performance of a novel suboptimal _ partial zero forcing _ ( pzf ) receiver , which uses an explicit fraction of the degrees of freedom for array gain and the remainder for interference cancellation . by showing that both the lower and upper bound are linear in @xmath0",
    ", we can conclude that the optimum transmit density is @xmath4 , and we demonstrate that this allows well known metrics like the transmission capacity @xcite , transport capacity @xcite , and the expected forward progress @xcite to all increase as @xmath4 as well .",
    "in addition to the large body of work on point - to - point and multiuser mimo systems , this paper is also related to several prior works that have studied the use of multiple receive antennas in ad hoc networks with poisson distributed transmitters .",
    "references @xcite and @xcite considered precisely the same model as this paper , but studied the performance of slightly different receiver designs that turn out to yield very different performance . in @xcite",
    "the receive filter is chosen according to the maximal ratio criterion and thus only provides array gain , while @xcite considers the other extreme where the @xmath0 antennas are used to cancel the strongest @xmath5 interferers but no array gain is obtained .",
    "both receiver designs achieve only a _ sublinear _",
    "density increase with @xmath0 , at growth rates @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . on the other hand , we show that linear density scaling is achieved if a fraction of the receive degrees of freedom are used for array gain and the other fraction for interference cancellation , or an mmse receiver is used .",
    "in @xcite the performance of the mmse receiver is investigated for a network in which the density is fixed and additional receive antennas are used to increase the per - link sinr / rate .",
    "it is shown that the average per - link sinr increases with @xmath0 as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the path - loss exponent , which translates into only a logarithmic increase in per - link rate and overall system throughput .",
    "in contrast , we study the rather different setting in which the per - link rate is fixed and the density increases with @xmath0 , and we show that exploiting the antennas to increase density instead of rate provides a significantly larger ( i.e. , linear versus logarithmic in @xmath0 ) end - to - end benefit ( c.f .",
    "section [ sec : efp ] ) .    early work on characterizing the throughput gains from mimo in ad hoc networks includes @xcite although these generally primarily employed simulations , while more recently @xcite used tools similar to those used in the paper and developed by the present authors .",
    "however , none of these works have characterized the maximum throughput gains achievable with receiver processing only .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model and key metrics are described in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the main results are derived in section [ sec : main ] , and then various extensions and relaxations of the model are considered in section [ sec : extensions ] : in all of these diverse permutations we observe that the linear scaling result still holds .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we consider a network in which the set of active transmitters are located according to a 2-d homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) of density @xmath10 ( transmitters/@xmath11 ) .",
    "each transmitter communicates with a receiver a distance @xmath12 meters away from it , where it is assumed that each receiver is randomly located on a circle of radius @xmath12 centered around its associated transmitter .",
    "note that the receivers are not a part of the transmitter ppp .",
    "each transmitter uses only one antenna , while each receiver has @xmath0 antennas .",
    "this setup is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "the poisson model is reasonable for uncoordinated networks , such as those using aloha .",
    "we briefly examine a regular interferer geometry that is a more appropriate model for networks employing more sophisticated random access techniques . ]      by the stationarity of the poisson process we can consider the performance of an arbitrary tx - rx pair , which we refer to as tx0 and rx0 . from the perspective of rx0 , the set of interferers ( which is the entire transmit process with the exception of tx0 ) also form a homogeneous ppp due to slivnyak s theorem ; see @xcite for additional discussion of this point and further explanation of the basic model . as a result",
    ", network - wide performance is characterized by the performance of a single tx - rx pair , separated by @xmath12 meters and surrounded by an infinite number of interferers located on the infinite 2-d plane according to a homogeneous ppp with density @xmath10 interferers/@xmath16 .    assuming a path - loss exponent of @xmath9 ( @xmath17 ) and a frequency - flat channel , the @xmath0-dimensional received signal @xmath18 at rx0 is given by : @xmath19 is the distance to the @xmath14-th transmitter / interferer ( as determined by the realization of the ppp ) , @xmath20 is the vector channel from the @xmath14-th transmitter to rx0 , @xmath21 is complex gaussian noise with covariance @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the power-@xmath24 symbol transmitted by the @xmath14-th transmitter .",
    "consistent with a rich scattering environment , we assume that each of the vector channels @xmath25 have iid unit - variance complex gaussian components , independent across transmitters .      if a unit norm receive filter @xmath26 is used , the resulting signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio is : @xmath27 without loss of generality , we assume that the distances @xmath28 are in increasing order in order to take advantage of the property that the ordered squared - distances @xmath29 follow a 1-d poisson point process with intensity @xmath30 @xcite . to simplify notation",
    "we define the constant @xmath31 as the interference - free signal - to - noise ratio , which allows us to write : latexmath:[\\ ] ] the independence of @xmath269 yields : @xmath270 = { \\mathbb{e}}[s ] { \\mathbb{e}}\\left[\\frac{1}{i } \\right ] , ~ \\mathrm{var}\\left(\\frac{s}{i}\\right ) = { \\mathbb{e}}[s^2 ] { \\mathbb{e}}\\left[\\frac{1}{i^2}\\right ] - { \\mathbb{e}}[s]^2 { \\mathbb{e}}\\left[\\frac{1}{i}\\right]^2.\\ ] ] we know @xmath271 and thus @xmath272 = n_r$ ] and @xmath273 = n_r(n_r+1)$ ] .",
    "it remains to find a lower bound on @xmath274 $ ] and an upper bound on @xmath275 $ ] .",
