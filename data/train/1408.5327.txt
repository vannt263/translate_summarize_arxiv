    "astrometry is an observation technique that measures the position of a celestial object in the sky .",
    "it is not a new field of study but it has garnered recent interest as a promising technique to search for extra - solar ( exo- ) planets around main - sequence and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "the presence of an exoplanet is inferred by observing the reflex motion of its host star due to gravitational perturbation from the planet . in order to detect jupiter - mass exoplanets , astrometric precision in the regime of a few to tens of micro - arcseconds",
    "is required to measure the motion , and hence the position of the candidate host stars . at the current state - of - the - art ,",
    "such a level of precision is only attainable with relative astrometry ( relative position with respect to a reference in the sky ) and with optical long baseline interferometry ( olbi ) if the observations are carried out from ground - based telescopes .",
    "olbi is a promising technique for ground - based high - precision narrow - angle astrometry because the theoretical precision of the measurement is inversely proportional to the baseline of the interferometer@xcite .",
    "high - precision astrometry has been successfully implemented with olbi for exoplanets search@xcite and currently there are several more attempts to use this astrometric technique for various other field of astronomy@xcite .",
    "there are at least three different approaches to measuring the relative position of a star with olbi .",
    "the first two approaches , directly and indirectly , measure the difference in optical path length between the position of the central fringes of the target and reference stars ( or dopd hereafter ) . in order to do this , the differential",
    "phase of the interference fringes of the two stars , which is proportional to the optical path difference per wavelength , is measured .",
    "the third approach measures the closure phase of the interference fringes of the two stars ( both the target and the reference stars are treated as one single target ) .",
    "the first two approaches require a minimum number of one interferometric baseline ( or a set of two telescopes ) to function while the third approach requires the use of at least three baselines ( or telescopes ) simultaneously .",
    "using additional baselines with all approaches increases the redundancy and the @xmath1-coverage of an observation , therefore decreases the amount of observation time needed for a given target . among the approaches , the direct differential phase measurement is the most commonly implemented@xcite .",
    "the direct measurement approach has been extensively discussed in the literature .",
    "instruments that implement this approach are engineered to measure the optical path of the starlight to an accuracy of better than 5 nm with a baseline in the regime of 100 m in order to attain the required precision .",
    "those instruments typically employ a complex and usually costly network of laser metrology systems for the optical path length measurements@xcite . depending on the circumstances of an observation , e.g.  observing from a remote and poorly accessible site in antarctica which is thought to be the best site on earth for long baseline optical interferometry@xcite",
    ", a complex optical and mechanical design of an instrument can be a significant disadvantage .    on the contrary ,",
    "the indirect approach to measuring dopd , which is the subject of this paper , may provide a simpler alternative solution .",
    "it is a method that is widely used for measuring complex visibility of binary stars but adapted for observing close binary stars which have separations wider than the normal interferometric field of view .",
    "firstly , this paper discusses the basic principle and the limitation of the indirect method .",
    "then , it reports on some recent observations using such a method carried out at the sydney university stellar interferometer ( susi ) to demonstrate the performance of the method .",
    "this paper also provides a suggestion for a simple narrow - angle astrometric instrument that is suitable for a variety of sites , including remote and poorly accessible observation site such as antarctica .",
    "the relative astrometry of two stars , @xmath2 , can be determined with an interferometer of baseline , @xmath3 , from differential fringe phase , @xmath4 , and dopd measurements because , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mean wavenumber ] of light at which the measurements were carried out . in the indirect approach , @xmath4 and dopd",
    "are inferred from the variation of the visibility of the combined fringes of the target and the reference stars .",
    "the visibility is higher when the fringes from the two stars are in phase ( or when @xmath4 is multiple of @xmath7 ) and lower when the fringes are out of phase ( or when @xmath4 is multiple of @xmath8 ) . the vector dot product in eq .",
    "varies with time as the pair of stars move across the sky due to the earth s rotation on its axis . as a result",
    ", the fringe visibility for a given pair of stars has a characteristic sinusoidal modulation .",
    "the squared visibility of the combined stellar fringes , @xmath9 , derived from the van cittert - zernike theorem is given as@xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the squared visibility of the fringes of the individual stars , @xmath13 is the brightness ratio of the secondary star to the primary , @xmath14 is the bandwidth ratio of the spectral channel . the _",
    "function in the equation is defined as @xmath15 .",
    "the equation above assumed that the spectral response of the beam combiner , the intensity of the source and the squared visibility of individual stars are constant within the spectral channel the measurement is performed . by measuring the fringe visibility of the two stars at different wavenumbers and times",
    ", the dopd and several other parameters ( @xmath13 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) can be extracted by fitting the above model to the measurements . given the straightforward relation between dopd and the relative astrometry of the two stars , @xmath2 , it is common to extract the latter directly from the model fitting instead .",
    "the uncertainty of the estimated astrometry is proportional to the uncertainty of the fringe visibility .",
    "the analytical form of the function , if it exists , is beyond the scope of this paper to derive it .",
    "besides the straightforward data reduction from primary observables to relative astrometry , the indirect approach method requires only one beam combining instrument . as a result",
    ", it does not require any metrology systems to measure non - common optical paths between beam combiners .",
    "this method is not entirely new but has been used for very narrow - angle astrometry on spectroscopic binary stars ( whose component stars have on - sky separation of @xmath16500 milliarcseconds ( mas ) ) by several authors@xcite and the measurement uncertainties obtained are in the sub - milliarcseconds regime . the work discussed in this paper , however , attempted the indirect approach method on close binary stars ( whose component stars have on - sky separations of @xmath172@xmath0 ) .",
    "there are three main challenges to be addressed when applying the indirect approach method to close binary stars .",
    "firstly , the beam combining instrument must have a wide interferometric field of view .",
    "secondly , observations of the characteristic modulation of the fringe visibility can only be carried out within a short time window at specific times .",
    "thirdly , which is the most challenging , unless the orientation of the baseline used for observation is right for a given position angle of a binary star the observation time window may not exist at all .",
    "the first two challenges essentially set the performance criteria for the intended beam combining instrument .",
    "the field of view of a beam combiner determines the largest star separation that the instrument can observe .",
    "it varies with design but is usually very narrow , e.g.  @xmath18500mas for npoi classic@xcite , mirc at chara@xcite and amber at the very large telescope interferometer@xcite ( vlti ) .",
    "this is one reason why targets for past experiments are limited to binaries of very small separations .",
    "on the contrary , the pavo beam combining instrument at susi which is used to demonstrate the indirect approach method has a wider field of view .",
    "its field of view of @xmath172@xmath0 enables pavo to observe binaries with larger separations than previously attempted .",
    "the optical design of pavo has been described in various other papers@xcite and therefore is not discussed in detail in this paper .",
    "the time window when the fringe visibility modulation can be observed depends on the coherence length of the fringes and the rate of change of dopd between fringes of the two stars . during this time window ,",
    "the fringe packets of the two stars crossover each other .",
    "the term fringe packet describes the localization of interference fringes within the coherence length due ` bandwidth smearing ' .",
    "the visibility modulation diminishes as dopd becomes larger than the coherence length and this effect is modeled by the _ sinc _ function term in eq .  .",
    "in a practical beam combiner , the coherence length of stellar fringes is in the order of several tens of micrometers ( @xmath19 m ) . the longer",
    "the coherence length the longer the observation time window is . with a simple north - south ( n - s ) baseline at latitude similar to susi ,",
    "the rate of change of dopd , which is proportional to the binary star separation , can reach up to tens of nanometers per second per arcsecond per 100 m of baseline .",
    "therefore , the window of opportunity to observe the visibility modulation of binary of a given separation with a 100 m baseline has an upper limit of about tens of minutes .",
    "this limit is adequate for averaging out the astrometric bias in the differential phase measurement due to anisoplanatism in the turbulent atmosphere@xcite , even at an average astronomical site like susi . nevertheless , a longer integration time is always advantageous for astrometry .",
    "other than that , the fast changing fringe visibility during the observation time window also gives rise to another requirement for the beam combining instrument that is to be used .",
    "the total integration time per @xmath9 measurement , @xmath20 , must be much smaller than the time for dopd to change by one wavelength , @xmath21 .",
    "the factor should be lesser than half in order to keep the systematic error of the @xmath9 measurements much smaller than its peak - to - peak variation .",
    "the limit for @xmath20 ranges from several seconds for observations in the visible wavelengths to several tens of seconds for observations in the near infra - red ( ir ) wavelengths .",
    "in general , beam combiners make a single @xmath9 measurement every several to tens of milliseconds but incoherently integrate several measurements together to increase signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . by limiting the total integration time ,",
    "the snr of the @xmath9 data points used for the model fitting is also limited .",
    "this eventually limits the astrometric precision due to random errors that can be achieve with the model fitting .",
    "so we need a sensitive beam combiner so that precise measurement of @xmath9 can be done in a short time .",
    "the fringe packet crossover event , described in the previous paragraph , occurs when the line joining the two stars of the binary is perpendicular to the baseline , i.e.  when the @xmath22 term in eq .",
    "this position - angle - baseline alignment does not always occur when a targeted binary star is observable .",
    "a target is considered observable when it is at a high enough elevation in the sky after sunset and before sunrise .",
    "for example , only @xmath2320 out of @xmath2370 close binary stars brighter than magnitude 5 have fringe packet crossover events that are observable with a n - s baseline at susi and at the vlti ( baselines h0-j4 ) .",
    "the number of stars in the example was determined by querying the washington double star ( wds ) catalog .",
    "the details of the query are given in the next section .",
    "the number of stars observable with this method can certainly be increased by adding more baselines of different orientations .",
    "for example , the number of binary stars exhibiting the fringe packet crossover event increases to @xmath2340 out of @xmath2370 if an additional east - west ( e0-j1 ) baseline is included at the vlti .",
    "it would take an uneconomical number of baselines , or telescopes , at a mid - latitude site to be able to always observe the fringe packet crossing event of any binary star at an arbitrary position angle .",
    "this could be one of the reasons why the indirect approach is less popular for narrow - angle astrometry . on the contrary",
    ", this approach could be favorable for observations from antarctica because such an event can be observed for every observable binary star with just one baseline because the sun does not rise during the southern hemisphere winter .",
    "therefore , there are two observable fringe crossover events per sidereal day for each binary star in antarctica .",
    "table  [ tab : targets ] compares the number of binary stars that exhibit fringe crossover events at various observation sites using a n - s baseline .",
    "also listed in the table is the total number of binary stars observable from those sites .",
    "the targets are queried from the wds catalog with the following criteria .    *",
    "magnitude of the primary component , @xmath24 * difference of magnitude between components , @xmath25 * binary star separation , @xmath26 * zenith distance during transit , @xmath27    the total number of targets observable is systematically lower at dome c , antarctica compared to the other two sites due to the distribution of bright binary stars over the southern hemisphere sky .",
    "however , unlike in mid - latitude sites , all targets have two observable fringe crossover events per day in antarctica .",

    "the pavo beam combiner was assembled and obtained its first stellar fringes in november 2008 .",
    "a similar setup@xcite is also operational at the center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) array .",
    "pavo is a multi - axially aligned fizeau - type interferometer .",
    "but unlike a typical fizeau interferometer , pavo forms spatially modulated interference fringes in the pupil plane of the interferometer and then spectrally disperses the fringes with a low resolution ( r@xmath2350 ) spectrograph .",

    "the relative astrometry of a binary star is expressed in a polar coordinate system where the radial axis , @xmath33 , measures the angular separation between the secondary and the primary component while the position angle axis , @xmath34 , measures the bearing of the secondary component with respect to the celestial north .",

    "also shown in the figures are cross - sectional plots of @xmath9 versus wavenumber at different hour angles . in the model",
    "fitting , the parameter @xmath38 was allowed to vary but @xmath39 was kept at 1 because the primary component of the binary is suspected to have a spectroscopic companion which may reduce fringe visibility while the secondary is estimated to be unresolved ( ud@xmath180.5mas ) .",
    "the accuracy of the values of @xmath13 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are less important as far as astrometry is concerned because the sinusoidal component of the visibility modulation depends only on the term @xmath4 in eq .   which is related to the fringe packet separation of the primary and secondary components of the binary .",
    "furthermore , the values of the 3 parameters are sensitive to how well the @xmath9 data are calibrated .    one drawback of this approach to determine the fringe packet separation indirectly from the modulation of the square of the fringe visibility is that the estimated position angle has a 180@xmath40 ambiguity .",
    "this ambiguity arises because the position of individual fringe packets could not be determined from the visibility modulation .",
    "therefore the position angle extracted from the model fit could either be 96@xmath40 or 276@xmath40 , if without any prior knowledge . in the case of @xmath30  lupi ,",

    "the discrepancy between the model and data is most obvious ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : obs_gamlup_1xxxxx ] when ha@xmath420.79 ) at a time close to the instance when the fringe packets cross over because the modulation of the fringe visibility is dominated by the astrophysical feature of the primary component .",

    "the data analysis and results demonstrate the fringe packet crossover observation technique in performing precision astrometry on close binary stars . a summary of systematic errors that affect the accuracy of the results is listed in table  [ tab : errbreakdown ] .",
    "the errors are listed according to two orthogonal axes in which they affect the measurements , i.e.  along the binary separation axis , @xmath55 , and along the position angle axis , @xmath76 .",
    "the dominant source of error in the @xmath33 axis is the accuracy of the wavelength scale while the dominant source of error in the @xmath34 axis is the misalignment between the imaging and the wide - angle baselines of the interferometer ( see ref   for definitions ) . as a result",
    ", the astrometric error in the right ascension and declination axes varies between the limits set by the two dominant error sources as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "errors arising from anisoplanatism of the turbulent atmosphere and time - stamping of observation data is negligible .",
    "the former is derived with an atmospheric coefficient@xcite of @xmath23780 m@xmath77s@xmath78arcsec@xmath79 for a total integration time of at least 10 minutes while the latter is derived from the accuracy of the system clock of the computer used for observation .",
    "lastly , the contribution of the uncertainty in measuring the fringe visibility to the astrometric error is mainly from its random error component .",
    "the astrometric error is not sensitive to a bias in the @xmath9 measurement because the astrometric parameters extracted from the model - fitting are dependent on the frequency of the @xmath9 modulation . the bias ,",
    "if it exists , is assumed to be introduced by the data reduction algorithm and is wavelength and time invariant . on the other hand ,",
    "the random error of the @xmath9 measurement ( usually expressed in terms of snr ) directly affects the astrometric error through the model - fitting process .",
    "although it is intuitive that a lower snr produces a larger astrometric error , it is difficult to derive an analytical solution to relate the two errors .",
    "therefore , for the sake of comparison with other sources of error , the magnitude of the astrometric error due to the random @xmath9 error is estimated from the results in the previous section .",

    "in addition , a next - generation instrument incorporating the suggested improvements is also discussed .",
    "firstly , the uncertainty of the wavelength scale can be reduced by increasing the spectral resolution of the pavo spectrograph and by adopting a more precise wavelength calibration procedures . with the same spectral bandwidth",
    ", @xmath82 , an increase in spectral resolution by a factor of 100 reduces the astrometric error by a similar factor because , @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the resolving power of the spectrograph . note that a high resolution spectrum in near infrared ( ir ) wavelengths is less desirable because @xmath82 in the common @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 bands ( 0.19@xmath19m@xmath79 , 0.11@xmath19m@xmath79 and 0.08@xmath19m@xmath79 respectively ) is much smaller than in the visible wavelengths .",
    "even with all the near ir bands combined , the spectral bandwidth is only half that of pavo s .",
    "this affects the number of @xmath9 modulation cycles seen across the bandwidth for a given dopd . a smaller number of cycles yields a larger astrometric error from the model - fitting process .",
    "an example of a high resolution spectro - interferometric instrument is the vega beam combiner at chara which has a spectral resolving power of 30000 and operates in the visible wavelengths@xcite .",
    "the reduction in wavelength uncertainty with this approach comes at a cost of reduced flux per spectral channel or more critically an increase in the fringe visibility uncertainty . in the photon noise limited regime ,",
    "@xmath88 while in the detector noise regime ( when observing faint targets ) , @xmath89 .",
    "such a cost can be partially offset by the exceptional seeing condition in antarctica , where this observation technique is most efficient . with an atmospheric coherence time of more than 8@xmath45 that at susi ( see table  [ tab : atmcond ] ) , the exposure time , @xmath90 , of one frame of interferogram can be @xmath2310@xmath45 as long in antarctica .",
    "the additional factor of @xmath91 can be offset by using siderostats with a larger diameter .",
    "therefore , the next generation instrument should be used with siderostats of about 60 cm in diameter , @xmath92 , a size similar to those used at the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) and the navy precision optical interferometer ( npoi ) .",
    "another advantage of having a high - resolution spectrograph is the long coherence length of the dispersed fringes . since the standard deviation of fringe motion due to atmospheric turbulence",
    "is expected to be @xmath1850@xmath93 in antarctica , the dispersed fringes will always ( @xmath94 of the time ) be visible to the beam combining instrument even at a low tracking rate ( @xmath2320hz ) if the spectral resolution of the spectrograph is larger than 300 .",
    "secondly , the uncertainty of the baseline alignment can be reduced by adopting a more precise optical alignment procedure . a procedure developed for a dedicated astrometric beam combiner , musca , at susi@xcite can align the pivot point of two siderostat pupils at the beam combiner to an uncertainty of @xmath231 mm .",
    "the pivot point of a siderostat ( or a telescope ) is defined as the intersection point between two of its axes of motion , i.e.  altitude and azimuth . in the case of a siderostat ,",
    "this point coincides with the center of the circular aperture of the mirror .",
    "the separation of the pivot points of a pair of siderostats ( or telescopes ) fundamentally defines the wide - angle baseline of an interferometer .",
    "the pivot point of a good siderostat can be kept from deviating from the center of the circular aperture to less than 100@xmath19 m within a time - scale of the order of a few weeks@xcite .",
    "the amount of deviation can be characterized and is included as part of the baseline uncertainty for the astrometric measurement .",
    "in addition , an ir led can be inserted into a hole centered on a siderostat , a design similar to an astrometric siderostat of npoi@xcite , for real time monitoring of the deviation if necessary .",
    "the anisoplanatism of the turbulent atmosphere would be come the limiting factor for higher precision astrometry once the wavelength scale calibration and the imaging baseline alignment issues are addressed .",
    "table  [ tab : atmcond ] shows the comparison of atmospheric conditions between 3 different astronomical sites .",
    "the atmosphere in antarctica is estimated to have @xmath233@xmath45 larger turbulent cells ( indicated by the fried parameter , @xmath95 ) than the atmosphere above susi .",
    "having such a stable atmosphere , the systematic astrometric error due to anisoplanatism ( which is inversely proportional to @xmath96 ) is negligible in antarctica .",
    "consequently , an hour long observation at susi would require @xmath235 minutes ( a factor of @xmath233@xmath97 shorter in time ) with the same instrument to produce the same level of astrometric accuracy in antarctica .",

    "an extra baseline , @xmath101 , independent and orthogonal to the first , @xmath102 , can reduce the astrometric uncertainty by a factor of @xmath103 in the direction of the binary separation when used simultaneously during the fringe crossover event observation . however , the main motivation to include an additional baseline , especially a shorter one , is to make observable those stars which would have a wider field of view increases the number of observable targets . although it does not increase the number significantly",
