    "we consider the production of a soft static lepton pair in a quark gluon plasma . in our approach",
    "we follow strictly the hard thermal loop ( htl ) scheme of @xcite , appropriate for a plasma in equilibrium at high temperature with a small coupling constant between the quarks and the gluons in the plasma .",
    "we thus construct the loop expansion using effective vertices and propagators instead of bare ones .",
    "the production rate of static virtual photons has already been evaluated at the one - loop level in the effective theory @xcite .",
    "previous works @xcite have shown that two - loop diagrams are of equal importance as the one - loop diagram .",
    "these large contributions are associated with new processes ( namely bremsstrahlung ) which arise only at the two  loop level . however , these processes are only a part of the full two - loop diagrams . in this paper",
    "we extend our previous work @xcite and complete the calculation of these diagrams .",
    "the underlying physical processes to be considered are compton and quark - antiquark annihilation which are already present at one loop .",
    "the underlying physical processes indicates that there is a possible double counting between one and two - loop results .",
    "more precisely , the two - loop diagrams of fig . 1",
    "are already contained in the one - loop diagram of @xcite ( with effective propagators and vertices ) when the gluon is hard and time - like .",
    "we take care of this problem by subtracting the appropriate counterterms .",
    "we show that the two - loop contribution corrects in a crucial way the calculation of the compton and annihilation processes based on the one - loop approximation @xcite .",
    "adding one and two loop contributions we find that in the limit of vanishing thermal masses we recover the result already found in @xcite where the authors used the bare theory .",
    "this solves a long standing puzzle related to the fact that the one - loop approximation in the effective theory did not reduce to known results in the naive perturbative expansion @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to derive analytically the full leading expression , in powers of @xmath0 , of the rate of static virtual photon production up to two loops in the effective theory .",
    "however , it is relatively easy to obtain analytically the large logarithmic @xmath1 terms .",
    "after some general considerations concerning our approach and the approximations useful to extract the leading logarithmic behavior we review the one - loop results and then discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec:2loop ] the two - loop calculation .",
    "the next section is devoted to an approximate evaluation of the counterterms . combining everything we then obtain in sec .",
    "[ sec : tot2loop ] the rate of virtual photon production . in the appendix",
    "we give the exact result for the counterterms , using effective vertices , where we show that the leading logarithmic behavior is the same as that obtained using the simplified version .",
    "it is well known that the production rate of a photon of invariant mass @xmath2 decaying into a lepton pair is proportional to the imaginary part of the retarded vacuum polarization of the considered photon @xcite : @xmath3 at the one - loop order , the trace of the vacuum polarization tensor is given by the fermion loop with effective propagators and vertices , as calculated in @xcite .",
    "the two - loop diagrams with their associated counterterms are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop ] .",
    "the justification of the use of counterterms is obvious .",
    "for example , when evaluating the first diagram in fig . 1 , one has to integrate over a region of phase - space where the gluon momentum @xmath4 can be time - like ( @xmath5 ) and hard ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this contribution is already included when using effective fermion propagators in the one - loop diagram .",
    "the role of the self - energy counterterm is to remove from the two - loop contribution the part which is already included at one loop .",
    "a similar discussion can be made concerning the diagrams on the second line of fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop ] , which indicate that the vertex counterterm must be introduced .    more formally",
    ", the counterterms automatically arise when we construct the perturbative expansion with effective propagators and vertices rather than with the original propagators and vertices .",
    "the effective perturbative expansion is nothing but a reorganization of the usual perturbative expansion .",
    "the effective lagrangian @xmath7 , which leads to effective propagators and vertices , already includes some one - loop thermal contributions . in order to keep the same theory as that given by the original lagrangian @xmath8 one has to supplement the effective lagrangian with counterterms to subtract order by order the loop - corrections already included in the effective lagrangian so that @xmath9 the counterterms are then treated perturbatively and thus appear in the expansion when looking at higher order topologies .    the imaginary part of the retarded vacuum polarization in eq .",
    "( [ virtualphot ] ) can be expressed as a sum over different cuts through the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop ] . calculating",
    "the cut diagrams with the full complexity of effective propagators and vertices would be a formidable task . to extract only the leading behavior of the two - loop contributions",
    "one can make some useful simplifications .",
    "this leading contribution arises essentially when a hard momentum flows in the quark loop .",
    "this is a consequence of the phase space available , @xmath10 in the hard region , compared to @xmath11 for the soft region . besides that",
    ", for soft fermion momentum @xmath12 , the leading contribution should be contained entirely in the one - loop diagram since effective propagators and vertices give the complete behavior at scale @xmath13 . in the soft quark region , the two - loop diagrams ( with associated counterterms )",
    "will only give sub - dominant terms while new dominant contributions can occur in the hard quark regime .",
    "concentrating now on the region where the quarks are hard , it is sufficient to use bare vertices rather than effective ones and to keep only the time - like sector of cut fermion propagators , which largely dominates over the space - like sector . to see that , one can compare the behavior of the spectral density @xmath14 in the time - like region with its behavior @xmath15 in the space - like region when the momentum @xmath16 is hard .",
    "we are therefore led to calculate the graphs of fig .",
    "[ fig:2loopsm ] with time - like cut fermion lines .",
    "with these simplifications , two types of cuts can be distinguished : those going through the gluon propagator and those going only through two fermion propagators . for the moment we ignore the latter because kinematical constraints would require either @xmath12 and @xmath17 ( see fig . 2 for the notations ) to be time - like and soft ( which would lead to a non leading contribution because of the small size of the phase - space ) , or @xmath12 to be space - like and hard so that the loop - corrections make these diagrams sub - leading compared to the one - loop result .",
    "cutting through the gluon line , it is convenient to distinguish the space - like @xmath18 region from the time - like one .",
    "the case of @xmath19 has been discussed in detail in @xcite where it has been shown to contain a new physical process ( bremsstrahlung ) absent from the one - loop result .",
    "no counterterms were needed in this region . from now on , we concentrate on the case @xmath20 .",
    "physically , this region corresponds to compton and annihilation processes , which are already included in an approximate way in the one - loop calculation of braaten , pisarski and yuan ( bpy )  @xcite .",
    "we expect a better approximation of these processes to come out from the evaluation of the two - loop diagrams for the following reason : when evaluating these two - loop graphs , we do not neglect @xmath12 and @xmath17 compared to @xmath4 in the self - energy and vertex corrections since @xmath12 and @xmath17 are hard and comparable to @xmath4 . on the contrary , in the htl approximation  external \" momenta @xmath12 and @xmath17 are neglected compared to the loop - momentum @xmath4 in the resummed self - energy corrections to the fermion propagators and in the estimate of the loop correction leading to the effective vertex .",
    "we therefore anticipate that in our two - loop calculations , terms of leading order in @xmath4 in the matrix element will be compensated by counterterms while terms of lower degree in @xmath4 will lead to new contributions .",
    "the counterterm method described here is not the only way which can be used to calculate the two - loop diagrams while avoiding double counting of thermal corrections .",
    "since , as mentioned above , effective propagators and vertices do not have the correct behavior in the hard limit ( more precisely when some of their external momenta are hard and space - like ) , an alternative way to proceed consists of introducing a cutoff scale intermediate between @xmath13 and @xmath21 . in this method",
    ", one uses effective propagators and vertices in loops carrying a momentum below the cutoff . above the cutoff , bare propagators and vertices can be used , and a loop correction must be inserted on the hard propagator . when adding the soft and the hard contributions the cutoff dependence should drop out @xcite .",
    "this method has been pioneered by braaten and yuan in their calculation @xcite of the rate of energy loss in a hot plasma , and used later in the calculation of the rate of hard real photon production by a quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "however it was not followed in @xcite where the effective propagators were used up to the hard momentum scale .",
    "a remark is worth making concerning the use of the cutoff method in @xcite .",
    "indeed , in these two papers , a bare gluon propagator is used even if the cutoff does not constrain the gluon to be hard . as a consequence of the misuse of the cutoff in this way",
    ", @xcite missed the important contribution coming from bremsstrahlung @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will obtain analytically the leading @xmath22 behavior of the vacuum polarization diagram . the argument of the logarithm",
    "is the ratio of a hard scale over a soft scale of order @xmath13 .",
    "technically , this arises from integrals of type @xmath23 or @xmath24 . to extract this leading behavior",
    "one does not need the full details of the effective propagators in the soft region .",
    "it is sufficient to approximate the fermion and gluon dispersion relations by their asymptotic forms in the hard region : the error involves ratios of soft scales which are of order @xmath25 compared to @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , only the upper branches ( quasi - particles ) of the dispersion relations will contribute because the lower branches ( collective modes ) of both the fermion and the gluon decouple exponentially fast in the hard region and therefore can not contribute a leading logarithm term .",
    "a last technical simplification consists in keeping a constant mass , independent of the momentum , along the dispersion curves : thus we have @xmath26 , the exact expression of the thermal masses being irrelevant for the logarithmic behavior .",
    "the virtual photon production rate has been calculated at one loop in the effective theory @xcite . in their calculation , bpy distinguished three types of terms depending on whether the pole ( time - like ) part or the cut ( space - like ) part of the fermionic spectral density is taken into account .",
    "we already extracted in  @xcite the leading logarithmic behavior of the cut - cut contribution and we showed that it should be compared to the @xmath27 part of the two - loop diagrams .",
    "we give now the remaining leading logarithmic part associated to the pole - cut contribution ( the pole - pole term does not lead to a logarithm because hard time - like momenta are kinematically suppressed ) which describes the compton and the annihilation processes . from eq .",
    "( 11 ) of @xcite , taking the hard momentum limit in the integrand , one can easily extract the leading logarithm given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of colors , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the thermal mass of soft quarks and @xmath32 is the electric charge of the quark of flavor @xmath33 , in units of electron charge .    for later use , it is convenient to translate this formula into an expression for the photon polarization tensor : @xmath34",
