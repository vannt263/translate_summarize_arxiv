    "the wave - function for @xmath198 and @xmath206 is not dominated by the near horizon region .",
    "these considerations lead us to consider in detail the am - f relation at small angular momenta @xmath166 where significant differences between de sitter and rindler space results occur . on the right hand side of fig.[desitwffig ] are shown the discrete eigenvalues for @xmath49 and @xmath207 ( first 3 curves ) and @xmath208 together with the corresponding rindler space m - f relations .",

    "the approximate metric ( [ spri ] ) is the metric of a product space of the @xmath232 rindler space and the 2-sphere .",
    "comparison of this metric with the rindler space metric ( [ rin ] ) shows that ( up to the normalization ) the eigenfunctions are given by the macdonald functions , which vanish at the boundary ( cf.eq.([bocu ] ) ) , @xmath233 with @xmath234 and @xmath212 given in units of @xmath235 and @xmath19 respectively . at this point",
    "we can proceed as above in identifying the m - f and am - f relations of rindler and spherical rindler space respectively .    to test the range of validity of this type of `` near horizon approximation '' , we apply the above approximation to de sitter space where , according to eq.([fr ] ) , @xmath236 and the near horizon metric and @xmath237 are given by , @xmath238 for vanishing @xmath212 and @xmath239 , the two quantities @xmath240 and @xmath237 differ by up to 30% and approach each other with increasing @xmath166 .",

    "having determined these quantities for a sufficiently large number of modes , as shown in fig.[disprel ] , the ( discrete ) eigenvalues @xmath249 for any static spherically symmetric space can be read off from this figure by identifying @xmath241 with @xmath237 ( eq.([spmcd ] ) ) and by taking into account that the scale of any dimensionful quantity is given by the appropriate power of the surface gravity .",
    "evaluation of thermodynamic quantities requires summation over the angular momenta @xmath166 and the number of zeroes @xmath30 .",
    "if the distance to the horizon satisfies @xmath250 significant contributions to the sum over angular momenta can be expected only if @xmath251 and the summation can be replaced by integration over @xmath166 , cf.eq.([spmcd ] ) , ( the summation over @xmath30 is not replaced by an integration ) , @xmath252 therefore the eqs.([omk]-[o0n ] ) apply with the area given by , @xmath253 while the quantities @xmath254 ( eq.([zet2 ] ) ) are `` universal'',i.e.,independent of the parameters of the static , spherically symmetric metrics with a non - extremal horizon . qualitatively , this universality was shown in reference @xcite . since based on t hooft s approximation @xcite ( cf.eq.([cond ] ) ) the expressions for the thermodynamic quantities however are incorrect .",
    "momentum- or angular momentum - frequency relations have been shown to be the generic tools for calculating the kinematics of scalar fields in static space - times with a horizon .",
    "in particular , in a large range of the kinematics , they exhibit properties which , after choosing appropriate scales , are universal , i.e.,independent of the details of the space - times , as our explicit comparison of m - f and am - f relations of rindler and de sitter space respectively demonstrates .",
    "these relations provide a direct avenue to approximate analytical and accurate numerical computation of the density of states , the essential ingredient for the thermodynamics of fields in spaces with a horizon .",
    "the central results for the thermodynamic quantities is summarized in expression ( [ appd ] ) and table [ tdl1 ] which imply that up to a correction of less than 1% , partition function and entropy are generated by a single mode , i.e.,black holes are low temperature systems .",
    "this property applies not only for the scalar fields in rindler spaces but also , as we have seen explicitly , for fields in de sitter space and more generally in static , spherically symmetric spaces .",
    "our results are in conflict with most of the results obtained by applying the brick wall method . in order to arrive at closed expressions",
    "it has become common to replace the discrete spectrum of eigenmodes by a continuous one .",
    "we have shown in detail that this procedure can not be justified and gives rise to values of the thermodynamic quantities which are too large by two orders of magnitude .",
    "new insights into the dynamics of quantum fields of higher spin , in particular of photons , cf.@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and gravitons via m - f or am - f relations can be expected .",
    "the imaginary parts of the corresponding stationary propagators @xcite , closely related to the m - f relations , indicate significant differences between fields of different spin .",
    "also the application to fields in rotating black holes @xcite,@xcite,@xcite promises to introduce a new element in the role of the probably complex m - f and am - f relations . with the one mode dominance of the thermodynamic quantities , a hidden `` parameter '' specifying",
    "the boundary condition , emerges which , as we have seen,(cf.eq.([dineu ] ) ) , influences severely partition function and entropy and needs to be determined .",
    "in order to identify in detail the large effect of replacing the @xmath30-sum with @xmath255 by an integral with @xmath256 as lower limit we introduce the following two functions @xmath257 and @xmath258 , cf.eq.([cond ] ) , @xmath259 which , if integrated , @xmath260 yield the approximate value of the partition function ( [ wkbwr ] ) provided @xmath141 .",

    "the dominant contribution to the partition function actually arises from values of @xmath130 in the interval @xmath264 and the integration over the interval @xmath265 reproduces the analytically determined value of the partition function ( [ wkbwr ] ) up to 0.1% .    in summary ,",
    "it is not a large number of modes which contribute and give rise to a large value of the partition function which would justify the approximation ( [ cond ] ) .",
