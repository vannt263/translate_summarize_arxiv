    "we correct measured velocity dispersions for all three samples using the model provided in @xcite .",

    "the median is 178  km  s@xmath8 and for @xmath72 ( red ) the median is 260  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding median sizes are 5.9  kpc , 0.74  kpc , and 2.2  kpc , respectively .",
    "the median size of @xmath17 sample selected to be compact ( gray points ) is 1.5  kpc .",
    "although the sizes of our intermediate - redshift compact galaxies are several times smaller than for the @xmath73 systems , velocity dispersions of two samples span the same range of values .",
    "most of our sample lies in the lower portion of the velocity dispersion range covered by the @xmath12 sample , but they follow the same trend in size - velocity dispersion parameter space .",
    "furthermore , the intermediate - redshift object with the highest velocity dispersion ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) falls very close to the locus of the high - redshift sample .",
    "we note that multiple - profile models tend to overestimate the size of the young morphologically disturbed systems in order to fit their extended asymmetric low - surface - brightness features .",
    "thus the upper limits on the half - light radii derived from the best multi - srsic fits can bring three young compact galaxies in our sample very close to the locus of low - redshift galaxies , but they may be misleading ( see the 2d profile in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig3 ] shows a tight size - dynamical mass relation in all three redshift regimes .",
    "this relation includes additional information about the srsic index of the best - fit profiles ( equations  [ eq : mdyn ]  and  [ eq : beta ] ) .",
    "as noted by e.g. @xcite , there is a clear offset between the loci of @xmath17 and @xmath12 galaxies in the range of dynamical masses where the two samples overlap ( @xmath74  m@xmath75  m@xmath76  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "in contrast , the sample of compact @xmath17 galaxies overlaps with high - redshift systems .",
    "although our intermediate - redshift galaxies have an average dynamical mass lower than high - redshift quiescent systems ( @xmath77  m@xmath75  m@xmath78  m@xmath1 ) , the two samples follow the same size - dynamical mass relation . the half - light radius of our most extreme target with @xmath79  km  s@xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) is very similar to or even smaller than the average size of similarly massive high - redshift systems .",
    "this result suggests that m@xmath80  m@xmath1 compact systems should also exist at @xmath12 , but with half - light radii of r@xmath81  kpc ( or @xmath82 at @xmath83 ) and with currently undetectable extended low surface brightness features .",
    "we identify nine galaxies with dynamical masses of m@xmath0  m@xmath1 as photometric point sources , but with redshifts between @xmath35 in the sdss spectro - photometric database .",
    "these nine galaxies have archival hst images demonstrating that they are indeed extremely compact .",
    "it is imperative to track the change in number density of compact systems with redshift , but no meaningful constraint can be derived from our inhomogeneous , serendipitous sample ( see tables  [ tab1 ]  and  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "our sample , however , demonstrates existence : larger samples of intermediate redshift compact quiescent galaxies based on well - defined selection criteria should provide number density estimates .",
    "in size - dynamical - mass parameter space our nine compact galaxies lie away from the typical @xmath17 sdss galaxies of similar mass . the most massive system in our sample - sdssj123657.44 + 631115.4 - lies right within the locus of massive compact @xmath12 galaxies .",
