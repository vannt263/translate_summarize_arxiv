    "to build a quantum computer is to arrange for laboratory instruments to produce results in accord with models expressed in equations of quantum mechanics .",
    "these quantum - mechanical models are of two types :    1 .   instrument - independent models focused on relating the multiplication of unitary operators to the solving of problems of interest , and 2 .   models that tie the multiplication of unitary operators ( as well as steps of state preparation and measurement ) to the use of laboratory instruments .",
    "instruments that could implement a quantum computer would be valuable if their results could substitute for a more costly classical calculation defined by a model of type 1 .",
    "if a scientist has such instruments , however , using them requires a model of type 2 which tells the scientist how to use the instruments ; it is these quantum - mechanical models of how instruments function that are the subject of this report .",
    "models of type 2 are subject to revision in the course of using instruments , as we found in arranging for a nuclear - magnetic - resonance ( nmr ) spectrometer to implement a model of an nmr quantum computer . in addition to its electromagnet that holds a liquid sample ,",
    "the spectrometer has a classical , digital process - control computer ( cpc ) , a variable radio - frequency ( r.f . )",
    "transmitter controlled by the cpc , and an r.f .",
    "receiver that reports back to the cpc which then computes spectra and displays them .",
    "our colleagues synthesized the active constituent of the liquid for a 5-spin quantum computer , aiming to have the spectrometer behave roughly as described by a certain model @xmath0 ( of type 2 ) , characterized by a hamiltonian for 5 linearly - coupled spin - active nuclei in the presence of the variable r.f .",
    "field.@xcite but while monitoring the chemical synthesis they found spectra that better fit a model @xmath1 ( also of type 2 ) characterized by a more complex hamiltonian with one spin - spin coupling weaker than desired and with extra couplings beyond those wanted .",
    "so model @xmath1 rather than the original model @xmath0 was used to design commands by which to operate the 5-spin quantum computer , showing that implementers have to negotiate with the instruments to refine their models .",
    "another lessen from the 5-spin endeavor is the secondary role of fields and particles in the design of instruments .",
    "we need models of how the spectrometer works to tell us what commands the cpc must issue to the transmitter in order to solve the deutsch - jozsa problem , and the historically available constructs and examples from which to construct these models are fields , particles and their couplings ; these however are needed only as pieces from which to compose models to describe the instruments . a change from model @xmath0 to model @xmath1 changes the couplings , and more severe changes change the particles and fields .",
    "is the need for alternative models serious ?",
    "whether one is working with a mathematical model or working with instruments , it is easy to assume that what goes on in the model , with its fields and particles , also goes on in the instruments , at least once the `` right '' model is found .",
    "but recently it was proved that multiple , inequivalent models to describe a set - up of instruments contend for acceptance not just in the early stages of an experiment but throughout.@xcite by assuring many models and hence many configurations of particles and fields to describe a single set - up of instruments , this proof punctures the idea that particles and fields ( or , more generally , states and operators ) reside in instruments , somehow uniquely situated in them , if only one could see them .",
    "this puncture relieves a widespread confusion between models and instruments by demonstrating a certain independence between the two .",
    "given that independence , one has the question : of what does contact between instruments and models consist ?    for purposes of an analysis that recognizes their independence , we focus on the contact between quantum - mechanical equations and laboratory instruments that takes place in computer files of a classical , digital process - control computer ( cpc ) . within a session in which both equation writing and the use of instruments are mediated by the cpc",
    ", a scientist uses the cpc to :    * compute ( classically ! ) with various sets of equations of quantum mechanics that define what the instruments are supposed to do , and * send commands to instruments intended to implement those equations and record results produced by the instruments .",
    "quantum mechanical models appropriate to the cpc control of instruments are formulated section 2 .",
    "section 3 addresses the a question of finding models from which to determine commands for any particular set - up of instruments , leading to an analysis of sample sizes of experimental tests of models as a function of precision .",
    "consistent with prior estimates@xcite , in quantum searching@xcite the required sample size rises exponentially with the number of bits .    section 4 shows lower bounds on the precision of timing needed for a cpc to manage quantum - computing instruments .",
    "section 5 introduces the concept of a lattice of models to show that testing in physics and engineering can not be universal like the test of a derivation in mathematics ; instead , a scientist working with instruments , trying for progressively higher precision in their accord with models , must re - evaluate properties by which to restrict a set of models , requiring repeated resort to guesswork .",
    "for one example of contact between instruments and equations , suppose a scientist has instruments which would implement a quantum computer if they were sent correct commands ; the scientist then faces the question of what commands the cpc should transmit and when it should transmit to them in order _",
    "e.g. _ to implement a quantum gate expressed as a unitary matrix @xmath2 .    to produce a core set of models from which a scientist can choose to describe the working of particular instruments , we suppose that during a cpc - mediated session some instruments are controlled by cpc - transmitted commands from a set @xmath3 of possible commands , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the set of all finite binary strings .",
    "our models express the probability of an outcome of instruments in response to a command @xmath6 sent to the instruments by the cpc , as follows .",
    "let @xmath7 be a separable hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 be the sets of all functions @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , respectively , with @xmath14 the core models exhibit discrete spectra for all @xmath15 :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 denoting the real numbers ) is the @xmath19-th eigenvalue of @xmath13 , and @xmath20 is the projection onto the @xmath19-th eigenspace ( so @xmath21 ) .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the probability of obtaining the @xmath19-th outcome , given transmission by the cpc of a command @xmath23 .",
    "although not commonly seen in texts , this probability of an outcome given a command is the hinge pin for focusing on quantum mechanical language used to describe what a scientist can find by using instruments .",
    "quantum mechanics constrains all these models to satisfy    @xmath24    where the @xmath25 denotes the hermitian adjoint .",
    "[ eq : basic ]    any choice of command set @xmath3 and of functions from the sets @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 produces a quantum - mechanical model @xmath26 . two models @xmath26 and @xmath27 generate the same probabilities @xmath22 if they are unitarily equivalent , meaning there exists a @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "for this reason , any model @xmath26 can be reduced to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 or , alternatively to @xmath35 where @xmath36 .    as was recently",
    "proved@xcite , in order that measured data can select a single best fitting model from a set of models ( up to unitary equivalence ) , additional restrictions are necessary to narrow down the set of models to a much smaller set than that defined by properties 1 and 2 , because many inequivalent models can be found to fit exactly and conceivable record of outcomes .",
    "furthermore , it was proved that these restrictions can not be derived from quantum mechanics nor from the measured data , so that imposing them takes guesswork on the part of the scientist .",
    "this core set of models is a subset of models available using more general formulations .",
    "because guesswork is necessary even to resolve choices among models of the core set@xcite , it follows that guesswork is necessary also to resolve the broader choices of models from supersets that include more models , _",
    "e.g. _ models involving positive - operator - valued measures or superoperators or both .",
    "it is conventional in endeavors aiming at quantum computing to assume three additional properties to narrow the set of models ; this is community - endorsed guesswork :    the command @xmath23 is the concatenation of separate commands for the three types of operations , so that @xmath37 where here the @xmath38 denotes concatenation of commands .",
    "according to these models , one can vary any one of the three while holding the other two fixed .",
    "this specializes eq .",
    "( [ eq : basic ] ) to the more restrictive form : @xmath39    an additional constraining guess characterizes models widely used in the analysis of quantum computers , a guess prompted by the desire to generate a unitary transformation as a product of other unitary transformations that serve as `` elementary quantum gates . ''",
    "for example , a scientist may want to generate the unitary transformation @xmath40 by causing the cpc to transmit some @xmath41 . for quantum computing to have an advantage over classical computing , the determination of this @xmath41 in terms of @xmath42 and @xmath43 must be of polynomial complexity @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed that @xmath41 is the simplest possible function of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , as follows .",
    "let @xmath44 be a set of instrument - controlling commands , thought of as strings that can be concatenated .",
    "suppose the function @xmath12 has the form @xmath45 for all @xmath46 ( note reversal of order ) .",
    "then we say the function @xmath12 respects concatenation .",
    "quantum computation employs a subset of models in which @xmath12 respects concatenation .",
    "finally , the theories widely used in quantum computing assume something about timing :    the unitary transformation commanded by any command @xmath41s takes a state @xmath11 at one time into a a state @xmath47 at a time later by some amount @xmath48 .    to appreciate contact between instruments and equations",
    ", it is essential to see properties 1 through 5 not as properties of laboratory instruments , but as properties that a scientist can choose to demand of models .",
    "whether the instruments act that way is another question .",
    "there are reasons , relaxation and other forms of decoherence among them , to expect limits to the precision with which instruments can behave in accord with properties 3 through 5 .",
    "all five properties are used often enough to be conventions , in the sense that a convention is a guess endorsed by a community .      in practice",
    ", a scientist has little interest in a model chosen so that its probabilities exactly fit measured relative frequencies .",
    "rather , the scientist wants a simpler model with some appealing structure that comes reasonably close to fitting .",
    "quantum mechanics encourages this predilection , because on account of statistical variation in the sample mean , functions that perfectly fit outcomes on hand at one time are not apt to fit perfectly outcomes acquired subsequently .",
    "we show here that accepting statistics no way takes away from the proof that measurements and equations by themselves can not link models to instruments .",
    "one needs a criterion for the statistical significance of a difference between two quantum - mechanical models ( or between a model and measured relative frequencies ) .",
    "here we limit our attention to models @xmath0 and @xmath1 which have a set @xmath3 of commands in common and for which the spectra of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the same . for a single command @xmath23",
    ", the question is whether the difference between the probability distributions @xmath51 and @xmath52 is bigger than typical fluctuations expected in @xmath53 trials .",
    "an answer is that two distributions are indistinguishable statistically in @xmath53 trials unless @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the statistical distance defined in eq .",
    "( 10 ) of a paper by wooters@xcite .",
    "furthermore , wooters s eq .  ( 12 ) shows for two models @xmath0 and @xmath1 that differ only in the function @xmath11 , @xmath56    to help judge the significance of the difference between two models with respect to a set b of commands common to them , a scientist who chooses some weighting of different commands can define a weighted average of @xmath57 over all @xmath58 .",
    "the same holds if model @xmath1 is replaced by relative frequencies of outcomes interpreted from measured results .",
    "it has been proved that the set of models statistically indistinguishable from a given model can be much larger than would be the case if the `` @xmath59 '' of ( [ eq : dangle ] ) were an equality@xcite .    for any set of outcomes , two models @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the form @xmath60 can perfectly fit the relative frequencies of the outcomes ( proposition 2.1 ) and",
    "yet be mutually orthogonal in the sense that @xmath61    wooters extended the definition of statistical difference to unit vectors representing quantum states .",
    "while for any two unit vectors , there exist measurement operators that maximize the statistical distance between them , for any such operator there exist other vectors , mutually orthogonal , that have zero statistical distance relative to this operator .",
    "for this reason , among others , statistics still leaves the scientist needing something beyond calculation and measurement to determine a model , for the set of models closer than @xmath62 in weighted statistical distance to certain measured results certainly includes all the models that exactly fit the data and , without special restrictions dependent on guesses , this set includes models that are mutually orthogonal .",
    "models close to given measured data are not necessarily close to each other in the predictions they make .",
    "by recognizing that models are distinct from instruments , it is easy to ask a question of the form : suppose model @xmath0 assumed to describe instruments , is wrong and another model , call it @xmath1 , describes the instruments better with respect to outcomes in some situation .",
    "even if instruments behave in accord with a model @xmath0 , it can be a lot of work to show this , and without showing it , one does not know it .",
    "while there are many models having properties 1 and 2 that fit any given outcomes of instruments exactly , making the the models indistinguishable with respect to fit , there are many other models that do not fit . given a model @xmath0 that fits and a model @xmath63 that does",
    "not , it was shown@xcite that models @xmath0 and @xmath63 are statistically distinguishable with respect to their fit to data measured for a command @xmath23 only if the statistical distance between @xmath0 and @xmath63 , which we call @xmath62 , is big enough in relation to sample size @xmath53 ; distinguishability requires @xmath64 this raises the question of the size of the statistical distance @xmath62 .",
    "very small values of @xmath62 are required to implement quantum searching@xcite , implying large sample size , as follows .",
    "the task of searching is often expressed as the task of finding the value ( assumed to exist and to be unique ) for which a binary function @xmath65 of @xmath66 bits is 1 .",
    "the function @xmath65 is expressed by an oracle , represented by a unitary transformation @xmath67 , diagonal in the computational basis of dimension @xmath68 , with 1 for each value except for @xmath691 in the place for the argument for which @xmath65 takes the value 1@xcite .",
    "for the example of the function @xmath70 such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , the algorithm for quantum search can be viewed as implementing a model that calls for three steps , ( the second of which is repeated many times ) :    1 .",
    "prepare a state @xmath75 2 .   on the order",
    "@xmath76 times , apply @xmath67 followed by @xmath77 ; and 3 .",
    "make a nondegenerate measurement diagonal in the computational basis .",
    "this works because @xmath78 reflects about the hyperplane perpendicular to @xmath79 , @xmath67 reflects about the hyperplane perpendicular to the basis vector corresponding to the special value ( which is @xmath80 for the case @xmath81 ) , and the product of the two reflections acts as a rotation moving the starting vector @xmath79 toward the special vector for @xmath65 .",
    "now we show explicitly how a small error in a unitary transformation can cause a failure .",
    "suppose that the instruments behave not in accord with the model @xmath0 described but in accord with a model @xmath1 that differs from @xmath0 in that in place of @xmath78 , the transformation is @xmath82 which lacks the component @xmath83 : @xmath84 it is easy to check that the angle @xmath85 between @xmath79 and @xmath86 defined by @xmath87 correspondingly , the error between the desired unitary transformation @xmath78 and the transformation @xmath82 that describes what the instruments do is readily calculated to be @xmath88 which is exponentially small in the number @xmath66 of bits .",
    "though exponentially small , the error @xmath62 completely destroys the quantum computation for the case of @xmath70 , because ( by construction ) @xmath89 , with the result that @xmath90 so the repeated applications of @xmath91 ( in step 2 , above ) accomplish nothing , and no magnification of the desired component @xmath83 is achieved , so with an error in @xmath78 as in eq . ( 11 ) , the outcome has negligible probability of corresponding to the right answer .      exploring contact between instruments and equations",
    "requires not just the recognition of multiple models for given instruments , but also modeling the commands sent to instruments . to verify that a command @xmath41 generates statistics corresponding to a desired unitary matrix @xmath92 requires trying the command out in conjunction with related commands @xmath93 to prepare state vectors ( @xmath19 ranges over a sufficiently large set ) .",
    "the number of these vectors must be larger than the dimension of the vector subspace relevant to problems in which @xmath92 is used .",
    "this means for @xmath66-bit quantum computing the number of vectors is greater than @xmath68 . for each vector",
    ", it follows from eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 11 ) that the sample size required to show that a command @xmath41 produces statistics consistent with any model to within the precision required for quantum searching is large indeed , namely @xmath94 , whence it follows that the number of trials ( the sample size ) needed to verify experimentally that command @xmath41 accords within @xmath62 with a model that says it generates @xmath92 is greater than @xmath95 , which in turn is greater than @xmath96 . with less than this amount of testing ,",
    "the likelihood that quantum computing instruments will perform to the required precision is essentially zero .",
    "while within some margin , the physics of a classical computer is insulated from its manipulating of symbols , that physics is not insulated from instruments commanded by a cpc ; indeed the precision of timing of the cpc matters critically to the successful functioning of instruments that it commands . per property 5 of section 2 , each unitary transformation takes a state at an earlier time to a state at a later time .",
    "thus a unitary transformation happens not all at once , but over a time duration that depends on how the instruments implement the transformation .",
    "a written command @xmath41 acts as a musical score . like sight reading at a piano , executing a program containing the command",
    "@xmath41 requires converting the character string @xmath41the score  into precisely timed actions  like the striking of keys at the piano . in this analogy ,",
    "the piano keys , so to speak , include the output buffers that control the amplitude , phase , frequency , and polarization of lasers of an ion - trap quantum computer or of radio - frequency transmitters for a nuclear - magnetic - resonance ( nmr ) quantum computer .",
    "for this reason , executing a command @xmath41 requires parsing it into pieces ( signals ) and sending each signal at its proper time , the specification of which is contained in the string @xmath41 .",
    "either the cpc that executes a program in which @xmath41 is written parses the command into signals and transmits each signal at its appointed time , or the instruments receiving the command @xmath41 , unparsed , contain programmable counters operating in conjunction with a clock that do this timed parsing .",
    "such programmable counters themselves constitute a special - purpose cpc .",
    "so either the scientist s cpc must execute commands by issuing an appropriately timed sequence of signals , or some other cpc attached to the instruments must do this .",
    "either way , the capacity to execute programmed motion in step with a clock is a requirement for a cpc , distinct from and in addition to requirements to act as a turing machine .",
    "implicit in models used in quantum computing is an additional property , to do with the effect of the mistiming of signals transmitted by a cpc executing a command @xmath41 for a unitary transformation .",
    "the effect of mistiming is to generate some ( unwanted ) command @xmath97 in place of @xmath41 . to think about the effect of mistiming",
    ", one can start with the simple case of a mistimed not - gate for one bit .",
    "two such gate operations concatenated result in the identity , which in the bloch picture is a rotation by @xmath98 .",
    "if it takes @xmath99(not ) seconds to perform the not - gate , there is an angular rotation rate ( in radians / s ) of @xmath100 . to avoid making an error greater than @xmath62 in the angle of the state vector ,",
    "it is then necessary to have the error @xmath101 allowable for the cpc in the timing of signals satisfy : @xmath102 for the search algorithm , eq . (",
    "11 ) implies @xmath103 the best precision of timing available from hydrogen masers is something like 1 part in 10@xmath104 , which fails to be adequate if @xmath105 ; i.e. the precision of the best hydrogen masers is less than the precision of timing needed if @xmath106 .",
    "in this section we review propositions proved elsewhere concerning guesswork required to link quantum - mechanical models to instruments and contribute a new one ; in addition , we describe how the set of models forms a lattice that a scientist navigates in searching for a model that fits data to within some prescribed weighted statistical distance ; finally we describe guesswork needed to replace a model that fits the behavior of instruments at one level of precision with a model that fits more precisely .",
    "consider a scientist searching for a model @xmath0 within a weighted statistical distance @xmath62 of relative frequencies of outcomes obtained by use of the instruments .",
    "the scientist needs to choose a model from some large set @xmath107 of models . to illustrate what is involved , suppose @xmath107 is the set of models of section 2 , constrained only to exhibit properties 1 and 2 . as proved earlier@xcite",
    ", we have the following three propositions :    given any recorded counts of measured outcomes associated with any set @xmath3 of commands , the set of models satisfying properties 1 and 2 contains many unitarily inequivalent models @xmath108 , each of which fits perfectly the relative frequencies of outcomes .    for",
    "any set of outcomes , two models @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the form @xmath60 can perfectly fit the relative frequencies of the outcomes ( proposition 5.1 ) and yet be mutually orthogonal in the sense that @xmath61    for measured data to uniquely decide to within unitary equivalence which quantum - mechanical model of a set of models best fits experimental results interpreted as outcomes by a criterion of least statistical distance ( or any other plausible criterion ) , the set of models must first be sufficiently narrowed , and this narrowing is underivable from the results and the basic properties 1 and 2 of quantum mechanics .    to these we now append :    any model @xmath109 working in the hilbert space @xmath7 can be mimicked exactly for all commands of @xmath3 by two other mutually perpendicular models working with any command set @xmath110 in the hilbert space @xmath111 .    _",
    "proof : _ to generate one of the mimicking models , replace @xmath11 by @xmath112 while for the other use @xmath113 , for any @xmath114 and any @xmath115 such that @xmath116 ; for both mimicking models , replace @xmath12 by @xmath117 and @xmath13 by @xmath118 .",
    "an easy check confirms that these models have the claimed properties of producing the same probabilities for commands of @xmath3 as does the given model , and that the two mimicking models are orthogonal to each other .",
    "@xmath119    all the subsets of @xmath107 constitute a lattice under set intersection and union ; we call this a lattice of models",
    ". any record of measured results interpreted as outcomes , together with a weighted statistical distance @xmath62 , defines a subset of @xmath107 consisting of those models that have the property being within @xmath62 in distance to the relative frequencies of the outcomes .",
    "the propositions show that @xmath107 is `` too big '' a set , in that it always contains models that are drastically different from each other , indeed orthogonal .",
    "that means the subset contains models that , by any plausible measure , are unappealing .",
    "each property applicable to @xmath107 defines a subset of @xmath107 ; _ e.g. _ property 3 defines a subset , and property 4 a subset of that subset .",
    "indeed , the lattice of models can be viewed as isomorphic to a lattice of properties .",
    "our scientist hopes to guess properties to produce a subset within which the models that are close to measured results are close to each other in the predictions they make , and have properties that the scientist likes . actually , the scientist wants to guess properties that narrow @xmath107 down to one model that appeals to the scientist and best fits the measured results .",
    "this can require a long journey .",
    "starting with @xmath107 , the scientist guesses a list of properties , each of which defines a subset .",
    "the list of properties defines a subset @xmath120 that shares all these properties , which is just the intersection of all the subsets defined by the properties separately .",
    "having defined this smaller set @xmath121 , the scientist explores the weighted distance between the models of this subset and recorded measured data , and also explores the closeness of the models that fit the data , if any , to each other .",
    "if carried out , this exploration results in one of three cases :    1 .",
    "there are widely disparate models in @xmath121 that all fit the data ; _ i.e. _ @xmath121 is too big , so the scientist needs to guess additional properties to shrink to fewer models ; 2 .",
    "no models of @xmath121 fit well , leading to the need to drop a property from the list to get a new subset of @xmath107 , which includes @xmath121 ; 3 .",
    "some models of @xmath121 fit the data well and these are close to each other in their implications , leading to the use of one of these models , say model @xmath0 .",
    "suppose the following :    1 .   a scientist cycles through these cases , arriving eventually at case 3 with a model @xmath0 , with @xmath62 as the weighted statistical distance between the model and relative frequencies of outcomes obtained from the testing of instruments .",
    "2 .   using the model to define commands for the cpc to transmit to instruments results in successful quantum searching for functions of @xmath122 bits , but the commands do not work for @xmath66 bits ; per eq .",
    "( 11 ) , requires a reduction of error by @xmath123 .",
    "3 .   the scientist needs to produce commands that more precisely generate behavior of the instruments described by quantum gates specified as unitary matrices @xmath2 for @xmath124 , and needs to achieve weighted statistical distance @xmath125 , or less .",
    "if a scientist has a command @xmath126 that generates behavior of instruments consistent to within @xmath62 of a desired unitary transformation @xmath2 , can the scientist likely find a command that is precise to within @xmath127 by searching , thus skipping the need to get a more precise model ? that depends on the how many commands have to tried , and the number of repetitions of each command necessary to obtain a sample size big enough to discriminate between models to within a statistical distance of @xmath128 .    to determine this number of commands that have to be tried , we introduce a notion of an @xmath62-grid on a metric space , here the lie group @xmath129 with the metric induced by the spectral norm . by an @xmath62-grid on a metric space @xmath130 , we mean a finite subset @xmath131 such that for any @xmath132 , @xmath133 such that @xmath134 . to be sure of finding a command @xmath135 that produces behavior within @xmath128 of @xmath2 ,",
    "it is necessary to explore all the points of an @xmath62-grid of the @xmath62-ball in @xmath129 around @xmath136 .",
    "there are at least as many such points as the ratio of the volume of an @xmath62 ball to the volume of an @xmath62-ball in @xmath129 . that ratio is @xmath137 , where @xmath55 is the dimension of @xmath129 , so @xmath138 .",
    "thus the number of points that have to be explored to guarantee finding one that improves the precision by enough to expand quantum search by one bit is , for just one gate command , @xmath139 , with @xmath140 .",
    "starting with precision just adequate for a 4-bit search , to reach precision just adequate for a 5-bit search requires exploring about @xmath141 commands . without counting the large number of trials needed to get a sample size big enough , blind searching is hopeless as a way to find better commands . finding a better model to generate commands , and thus avoiding a search over all these commands , appears indispensable .",
    "a model @xmath0 found in the beginning of a quantum - computing experiment by trying out small problems for a small sample sizes and a small set of commands @xmath142 will likely be inadequate to generate the precision required to deal with larger problems , such as factorizing larger integers or searching a larger list .",
    "with blind searching ruled out , a better model , call it @xmath1 , is necessary from which to determine more precisely the commands and their timing .    how does looking for and deciding on a better model work ?",
    "can this be done by a universally applicable program , run by the cpc that controls the quantum computing instruments ?",
    "hope for this automation lies mostly the idea that searching for a better model is adequately defined by the objective of a better fit to measured results and by a desire for simplicity in the model ; the hope is perhaps spurred also by the allure of the universal test used in mathematical logic , isolated from laboratory instruments , for testing a claimed derivation , a test that can be thought of as a universally applicable program for a turing machine@xcite .",
    "this hope is dashed by wittgenstein s contribution to the foundations of both psychology and set theory , when he made unequivocally clear that words are what people say in various scenes , so that what the speaking of a word means depends on the scene in which the word is spoken@xcite .",
    "this applies to words transmitted by a cpc as commands to computer - controlled instruments .",
    "the evaluation of the words can not be independent of the evaluation of the activity and actions of the instruments generated by those words .",
    "( without this connection any concept of testing falls in confusion , because the same word , whether uttered by a person or transmitted as a command to an instrument by a cpc , produces actions that depend on context beyond the power of verbal or mathematical analysis , as follows from the previously cited proof of the need for guesswork to link models to instruments . )",
    "this means that , even under our bold assumption that suitable commands exist , the finding of a model with certain properties that fits measured data at one level of precision by no means assures the existence of a model having those properties and fitting the same measured data at greater precision , let alone data obtained from larger samples and a larger set of commands .",
    "thus when larger problems are tackled , with their demand for increased precision , the scientist can expect to have to go back through the lattice of models , encountering all three cases , to find new , possibly more complex properties by which to narrow the set of models .",
    "this implies a need for a scientist operating a quantum computer to switch back and forth between modes of quantum computing and modes of refining the model and the commands it calls for.@xcite    = 4.375 in    -.5",
    "it has been striking and surprising to find in the course of this work that contact between instruments and equations is a barely discovered discipline of physics , awaiting further investigation .",
    "the example of quantum searching shows up some of the issues of contact especially vividly .",
    "the quantum computing problem of factorizing and the deutsch - jozsa problem require a number of gate transformations polynomial rather than exponential in the number of bits , and so the challenges to their implementation are less extreme . nonetheless implementing any device described quantum mechanically at progressive levels of precision calls for navigating a lattice of models , coping with ambiguity among inequivalent models , dealing with sample sizes made necessary by quantum indeterminacy , and managing via machinery that is specified classically the timing of signals at the precision demanded by quantum mechanics . here",
    "we have provided some tools for a promising discipline . since they are of general application , not limited to quantum computing , these tools are widely applicable to efforts that join theory and experiment in quantum physics .",
    "we thank amr fahmy for contributing to our thoughts and discussions at many points during this work .",
    "in addition to him , we are indebted to steffen glaser , and raimund marx , and wolfgang bermel for introducing us to the subtleties of laboratory work aimed at nuclear - magnetic - resonance quantum computers@xcite .",

    "<S> ambiguity in the contact between laboratory instruments and equations of quantum mechanics is formulated in terms of responses of the instruments to commands transmitted to them by a classical digital process - control computer ( cpc ) ; in this way instruments are distinguished from quantum - mechanical models ( sets of equations ) that specify what is desired of the instruments . </S>",
    "<S> results include :    1 .   a formulation of quantum mechanics adapted to computer - controlled instruments ; 2 .   a lower bound on the precision of unitary transforms required for quantum searching and a lower bound on sample size needed to show that instruments implement a desired model at that precision ; 3 .   a lower bound on precision of timing required of a cpc in directing instruments ; 4 .   </S>",
    "<S> a demonstration that guesswork is necessary in ratcheting up the precision of commands . </S>"
