    "courant and robbins in their book @xcite formulated a problem stated up by h. whitney .",
    "the problem is as follows .",
    "`` suppose a train travels from station @xmath0 to station @xmath1 along a straight section of track .",
    "the journey need not be of uniform speed or acceleration .",
    "the train may act in any manner , speeding up , slowing down , coming to a halt , or even backing up for a while , before reaching @xmath1 .",
    "but the exact motion of the train is supposed to be known in advance ; that is , the function @xmath2 is given , where s is the distance of the train from station @xmath0 , and @xmath3 is the time , measured from the instant of departure .",
    "on the floor of one of the cars a rod is pivoted so that it may move without friction either forward or backward until it touches the floor .",
    "if it does touch the floor , we assume that it remains on the floor henceforth ; this will be the case if the rod does not bounce .",
    "is it possible to place the rod in such a position that , if it is released at the instant when the train starts and allowed to move solely under the influence of gravity and the motion of the train , it will not fall to the floor during the entire journey from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ? ''     is the inertial frame .",
    "[ overflow],width=170,height=40 ]    the authors gave positive answer to this question .",
    "their argument was informal .",
    "v. arnold in @xcite considered this problem as open .",
    "the complete solution to the problem has been given by i. polekhin in his ph.d .",
    "thesis ( unpublished ) see also @xcite .",
    "he solved the problem by direct application of results from @xcite .    in this article",
    "we prove simple and general theorem which implies particularly that there are continuum never - falling solutions to whitney s problem , we also believe that this theorem describes many other such a type effects .",
