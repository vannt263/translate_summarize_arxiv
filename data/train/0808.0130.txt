    "series of test - beam measurements have been performed on the calorimetric system of cms over the last few years in order to optimize its design and study its performance .",
    "detailed monte - carlo simulations of the test - beam configuration have been made and the results compared with these test - beam measurements , leading to a number of improvements in the simulation code .",
    "presented here is a comparison between the results from the 2006 test - beam and the geant4-based monte - carlo simulations of this setup .",
    "the compact muon solenoid detector ( cms)@xcite is one of the general purpose detectors for the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , to start operations in 2008 . it s calorimetric system consists of electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) and hadronic calorimeter ( hcal ) positioned inside the superconducting solenoid , and a pair of very - forward calorimeters positioned outside of the return yoke of the magnet ( fig.[cms_calorimeters]a ) . for the purpose of this study only one super - module of ecal crystals , without the preshower in front , and a pair of hcal barrel wedges were used , as shown in fig.[cms_calorimeters]b .",
    "the outer calorimeter ( ho ) was present in both the test - beam environment and in the simulation geometry , but was intentionally left out of the comparisons , as its inclusion introduces additional uncertainties which were not well understood at the time of this study .",
    "the forward calorimeter ( vf ) was not included in the study .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      fig.[long_shower ] shows the comparison of the longitudinal shower profiles measured in hb2 wedge and simulated with three different physics lists .",
    "the qgsp - bert physics list , using the bertini - cascade for low - energy interactions , shows best agreement with the measured profiles .",
    "fig.[ecal_profile ] compares the transverse shower profiles measured in ecal , and the transverse shower containment .",
    "agreement is good for both physics lists shown .    ]",
    "an important measurement for the calibration of hcal is the fraction of events which leave mip - like signal in ecal . as fig.[mip_fraction ] shows , the bertini physics list has a major discrepancy at low energies , which is attributed to the inadequate description of the quasi - elastic processes .",
    "this is one of the major issues which the geant4 team is addressing in the next releases of the software .",
    "geant4 simulated response is in overall agreement with the measured data .",
    "we still observe small discrepancies in the following quantities :    * simulated resolution is much better than the measured one , which is due to the smaller variation in signal distribution in hcal at high energies . * some discontinuities in the response curve at intermediate energies . *",
