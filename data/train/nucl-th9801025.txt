    "with the advent of continuous wave electron accelerators at mainz and the jefferson laboratory ( formerly cebaf ) , studies of the hadronic electroweak response at low- and intermediate - energy have entered a new era .",
    "one hopes to use these facilities to develop a better understanding of the structure of hadrons in terms of qcd quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition , there exists the possibility of performing searches for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions .",
    "> from both standpoints , an interesting class of observables are those which depend on target or electron spin .",
    "recent advances in polarization technology have opened the way to precise measurements of spin observables .",
    "information gleaned from these observables provides a more detailed probe of hadron structure and new physics \" than does data from spin - independent measurements alone @xcite .    as an example of the information which spin - observables might provide , we consider in this paper the electroweak excitation of the @xmath2(1232 ) resonance : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the nucleon and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 .",
    "the sm has been tested with high precision in a variety of sectors @xcite , so that one knows the basics of the probe reactions extremely well . in principle , then , one may use these electroweak processes to study hadron structure as it bears on the @xmath1 transition amplitudes .",
    "conversely , were one to have the hadronic current matrix elements sufficiently well in hand , one might exploit this transition as a probe of possible new physics \" beyond the standard electroweak theory .",
    "the @xmath1 transition is potentially useful for either purpose , since ( i ) the @xmath0 resonance is nicely isolated from the plethora of other densely populated nucleon resonance states that appear at higher energies , and ( ii ) it is a pure isovector , spin - flip transition .",
    "the first of these features simplifies the theoretical extraction of the matrix element @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the appropriate electroweak current ) from the experimental observables , while the second affords one a kind of filter \" for selecting on various aspects of hadron structure or new physics .",
    "for example , there has been considerable interest recently in the strange quark content of non - strange hadrons @xcite . since @xmath10 pairs contribute only to isoscalar current matrix elements , the @xmath4 to @xmath11 transition filters out @xmath10 contributions .",
    "similarly , the isovector character of this transition gives it a different sensitivity to possible contributions from additional heavy particles not appearing in the sm than does , say , the weak charge measured in atomic parity violation .",
    "the @xmath1 offers the additional advantage that it only couples strongly to one outbound channel , viz .",
    ", @xmath12 .",
    "this allows one , in principle , to treat the unitarity issue quite rigorously@xcite implementing in the theoretical analysis the constraints of the fermi - watson theorem @xcite .",
    "the physics of the @xmath1 transition can be probed through a variety of processes :    electromagnetic ( em ) : @xmath13 weak neutral current ( nc ) : @xmath14 weak charge changing ( cc ) : @xmath15 or the inverse cc reactions involving incident charged leptons . here",
    ", @xmath16 is a real or virtual photon , @xmath17 are charged leptons , @xmath18 denotes any of the charged or neutral pion states , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are appropriate nucleon and delta states , respectively .",
    "in addition , the axial vector transition matrix can potentially be studied @xcite by the purely em reaction @xmath21 in the limit that the final state pion is soft .",
    "the em processes yield three resonant helicity amplitudes for the virtual photons , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 : two transverse and one longitudinal indicated by the appropriate superscript indicates the absolute value of the helicity of the virtual vector boson  nucleon system along the @xmath25 direction ( i.e. the helicity of the produced @xmath11 ) . ] .",
    "the longitudinal amplitude is absent for real photons .",
    "the primary information one has regarding the vector helicity amplitudes has been obtained from em processes ( [ eqem ] ) with real photons .",
    "recent neutral pion photoproduction experiments using polarized photons at the brookhaven legs facility@xcite and mainz@xcite have determined the vector helicity amplitudes with better than 2% precision@xcite .",
    "the value of the e2/m1 ratio , extracted from the vector helicity amplitudes , is of particular interest from the standpoint of hadron structure theory , as it yields information on deviations from spherical symmetry , possibly arising from tensor quark - quark interactions .",
    "it is predicted to vary strongly with @xmath26 and reach unity as @xmath26 becomes large@xcite . at present ,",
    "the e2/m1 ratio is poorly known beyond the photon point , with precision decreasing as @xmath26 increases .",
    "one expects electro - production and compton scattering experiments at the jefferson lab to yield significant improvements in precision with which one knows the e2/m1 ratio for @xmath27 as well as that of other vector current observables .",
    "ultimately , the most serious obstacle to decreasing the uncertainty in the vector amplitudes may be the theoretical problem of separating background from resonance contributions @xcite .",
    "the weak nc and cc reactions are sensitive to the weak vector current analogues of the @xmath28 as well as to additional helicity amplitudes associated with the weak axial vector current .",
    "existing data obtained from cc reactions ( [ eqcc ] ) provide a crude corroboration of the present knowledge of the vector form factors @xcite , but do not improve upon the precision obtained via the electromagnetic processes .",
    "the same cc reactions also yield information on the axial vector amplitudes and , in principle , provide a determination of the @xmath1 axial vector form factors .",
    "however , the data only afford a highly model - dependent determination of resonant axial form factor parameters , and the associated uncertainties are large @xcite .    there is , to date , no direct experimental neutral current data for the process in eq .",
    "( [ eqnc ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the prospects for obtaining such data with parity - violating ( pv ) electron scattering with the g0 detector at the jefferson lab appear to be promising @xcite .",
    "indeed , a proposal by the g0 collaboration to measure the pv @xmath1 transition has recently been approved @xcite . in this paper , we therefore focus on the nc process of eq .",
    "( [ eqnc ] ) , and illustrate how knowledge of the nc @xmath1 helicity amplitudes might complement existing information . in particular , we analyze the sensitivity of the pv asymmetry to various scenarios for extending the standard model and to the axial vector transition form factors of interest to hadron structure theory . to that end",
    ", we study the kinematic dependence of the figure of merit ( fom ) for measuring the asymmetry and identify the optimal conditions for a probe of new physics or an extraction of the axial amplitudes .",
    "we also estimate the contribution from non - resonant background processes under these different conditions . since one has no experimental means of separating resonant from non - resonant contributions with a single pv measurement , a theoretical subtraction of the latter is required in any determination of resonant amplitudes . finally , as there exists no recent publication devoted to the nc @xmath1 transition beyond the early work of refs .",
    "@xcite we provide a compendium of model predictions for the various transition form factors as well as a review of various kinematic properties and notational conventions .",
    "our hope is to provide a resource for experimentalists studying the feasibility of a pv @xmath1 measurement .    in order to guide the reader ,",

    "( [ delpi3 ] ) , we have ignored non - resonant axial vector contributions for simplicity .    the physics of interest lies in @xmath43 and @xmath50 .",
    "the background term @xmath42 introduces a theoretical uncertainty into the extraction of the other two terms from @xmath51 .",
    "a precise measurement of the first term , @xmath43 , would provide a window on physics beyond the sm .",

    "@xcite , effective lagrangians are used to study the asymmetry in the energy region from the pion threshold to the @xmath11 resonance .",
    "the @xmath11 is treated as a rarita - schwinger field with the phenomenological transition currents given in eqs .",
    "( [ 46],[47 ] ) .",
    "the background contributions are obtained from the usual born terms , computed using pseudovector @xmath107 coupling .",
    "no vector meson exchanges in the @xmath132-channel are included .",

    "the model was tested by comparing with the inclusive em cross section , for which data exist .",
    "in fact , even allowing for a 50% uncertainty in the background , the model reproduces the em cross section reasonably well .",
    "it becomes less reliable at momentum transfers above @xmath293 gev@xmath294 , since specific parameterizations for the @xmath26-dependence of the @xmath1 form factors become important in this region .    in the present context",
    ", we employ the model of ref .",
    "@xcite to compute @xmath42 and the background contribution to @xmath50 .",
    "we consider only single pion production background processes .",
    "the results are given in fig .",
    "4 and tables 2 and 3 . in fig .",
    "4 , we show the individual terms @xmath36 and total @xmath295 as a function of incident energy for scattering at forward and backward angles .",
    "tables 2 and 3 include the ratio @xmath296 for a variety of angles and incident energies . from these results , we find that the vector current background contribution in general increases with energy for fixed angle . at the kinematics most suited for a determination of @xmath63 ( @xmath297 gev , @xmath298 ) , the vector current background contributes about 4 - 6% of the total .",
    "thus , a probe for new physics at the one percent level would require a theoretical uncertainty in the background to be no more than 15 - 25% of the total for @xmath42 .",
    "given that the present model permits a 50% uncertainty in the background and still produces agreement with inclusive em pion production data , one could argue that a model estimate of @xmath42 is not sufficient for purposes of undertaking a one percent standard model test .",
    "it appears that the model - independent approach , in tandem with an experimental isospin decomposition of the em pion production process , offers the best hope for achieving a sufficiently precise elimination of the vector current background .",
    "the situation regarding @xmath50 appears more promising . at @xmath299 and @xmath300 gev , we find @xmath301 , and so even a large uncertainty in @xmath42 has negligible effect on an extraction of the axial term . at these kinematics , @xmath85 is fairly low , and both the asymmetry and figure of merit would be the limiting factors for an extraction of @xmath44 .",
    "as the energy increases somewhat , the figure of merit improves , but the requirements on @xmath42 become more stringent . at @xmath299 and @xmath302",
    "gev , @xmath303 , so the permissible uncertainty in the vector current backgrounds here need to be comparable to the desired precision for @xmath50 . at more moderate angles , the situation is similar . at @xmath304 and @xmath305 gev , for example , we find @xmath306 , so @xmath42 is not likely to be the limiting factor in an extraction of the axial term .",
    "but at @xmath304 and @xmath300 gev , where the figure of merit is somewhat improved , @xmath307 , and again the vector backgrounds must be understood rather well to extract useful information about the resonant axial form factors . in order to extract @xmath29 from @xmath50 , one must separate the resonant from non - resonant axial contributions .",
    "the latter contains two terms : a purely non - resonant contribution and a term arising from the interference of the resonant and non - resonant axial amplitudes . within the present model ,",
    "these two terms carry opposite signs , leading to significant cancelation between them . at forward angles and energies in the 1 to 2 gev range , the magnitude of each is in the 15 - 30% range , yielding a total axial background contribution that is about 10% of @xmath50 .",
    "although undertaking an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty in @xmath308 is a subjective exercise , one might conservatively assign a 100% uncertainty to this term , leading to a 10% uncertainty in @xmath309 from axial vector backgrounds .",
    "* b. radiative correction uncertainties *    the most problematic uncertainties which enter the electroweak radiative corrections are those arising from non - perturbative hadronic effects .",
    "these hadronic uncertainties contribute via the quantity @xmath310 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ delpi1 ] ) and the analogous quantities @xmath311 which modify the tree - level axial vector hadronic nc couplings . in the limit of single vector boson exchange between the electron and target",
    ", vector current conservation protects @xmath43 from receiving large hadronic effects .",
    "the reason is that for this term , @xmath312 and @xmath313 differ only by a constant of proportionality ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "consequently , in the hadronic ratio @xmath122 most hadronic contributions to electroweak corrections cancel .",
    "this cancelation is not exact , due to light quark loop effects in the @xmath314 mixing tensor . for the present purposes ,",
    "however , the level of uncertainty associated with these light quark loops appears to be negligible @xcite .",
    "this situation is modified when one considers corrections involving the exchange of two vector bosons between the electron and target , as shown in fig .",
    "5a . in this case",
    ", the response functions receive contributions from matrix elements of the form @xmath315 where the @xmath316 are electroweak currents with @xmath277 and @xmath131 denoting appropriate combinations of the em , nc , and cc operators .",
    "the matrix element of eq .",
    "( [ cprod ] ) receives contributions from a plethora of intermediate states .",
    "hence , the radiative correction depends on the sum of products of transition current matrix elements , and the simple cancelation in @xmath122 that occurs in the one - boson exchange limit no longer applies @xcite .",
    "the scale of this correction , sometimes referred to in the literature as a dispersion correction \" , is nominally @xmath317 .",
    "consequently , in order to extract constraints on new physics given @xmath63 to one percent , one must have a reliable calculation of the dispersion correction .",
    "to date , no such calculation has been carried out .",
    "an estimate for elastic pv processes has been reported by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , where only the contribution from the nucleon intermediate state has been included .",
    "the results indicate that this contribution alone is not likely to be problematic .",
    "a complete calculation , for both elastic and inelastic processes , awaits future efforts .",
    "a second class of hadronic effects which requires further study affects only @xmath50 at leading order . as illustrated in fig .",
    "5b , these effects involve parity - violating quark - quark interactions within the hadron , leading to an effective pv photon - hadron coupling @xcite .",
    "navely , these corrections are @xmath317 , and should not seriously affect a 25% determination of the axial vector transition form factors . this nave scale , however , is somewhat misleading .",
    "the full pv amplitude containing these corrections is no longer proportional to @xmath318 , as in the tree - level @xmath7-exchange case , since a photon is now exchanged .",
    "hence , relative to the tree - level process , the amplitude involving hadronic pv is of order @xmath319 .",
    "furthermore , in the case of elastic pv electron scattering from the nucleon , the pv hadronic vertex receives additional infrared enhancements @xcite .",
    "should these enhancements appear in the @xmath1 case as well , the scale of the correction could be as large as the tree - level process .",
    "since the corrections from hadronic pv involve non - perturbative hadronic effects , they should be analyzed before an experimental determination of @xmath50 is undertaken . at present , no such analysis has been reported in the literature .",
    "for an estimate of the best design of a future experiment on the measurement of the asymmetry , we start with some information that represent a plausible run sequence at cebaf@xcite .",
    "we use the following inputs : @xmath320 the percent error for the asymmetry is calculated by the formula @xcite @xmath321 where the figure of merit ( fom ) @xmath322 is given by @xmath323 and where @xmath324    the precise experimental numbers we choose are to a large extent arbitrary",
    ". clearly the figure of merit can be very simply scaled using eq .",
    "( [ 81 ] ) for any numbers which differ from our assumptions .",
    "( for example , our solid angle assumption is overly conservative for backward angle experiments . ) in order to further improve our numerical estimates , we use a more accurate effective parameterization of the pion production cross sections @xcite .",
    "details are provided in appendix a. the difference in total counting rate between the improved fits obtained from ref.@xcite and the direct results from eqs .",
    "( [ sigtot])-([rt ] ) are generally small , typically of the order @xmath325 10 - 20% .    as stated earlier , the physics of interest lies primarily in the quantities @xmath164 and @xmath44 . focusing first on @xmath164 , we note that it is a constant , independent of @xmath68 or @xmath326 . as we see from eq .",
    "( [ alr1 ] ) , the overall asymmetry grows linearly with @xmath85 , but the counting rate ( @xmath327 and @xmath328 ) drops rapidly at large @xmath85 , due to transition form factors .",
    "thus , there is in general a kinematical compromise required , and only some limited range of energy and scattering angle maximizes the statistical figure of merit defined above .",
    "in addition , independent of the figure of merit , one must also seek kinematics which suppress the uncertain non - resonant backgrounds , and suppress ( for standard model tests ) the axial transition term as well .",
    "the latter requirement forces one towards larger incident energies , but the need for moderate @xmath85 ( to keep the figure of merit high , and reduce the uncertainty in the backgrounds ) then demands smaller scattering angles .",
    "going to smaller scattering angles , in turn , reduces the available solid angle of detection and , hence , also the figure of merit .",
    "there is clearly no completely unambiguous final choice for kinematic variables , the tradeoffs will ultimately depend on the specific experimental setup .    in order to clarify this situation ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fom-3d ] a plot of @xmath329 ( scaled ) versus incident energy and electron scattering angle . on this scale ,",
    "reaching 1 corresponds to a 1% statistical uncertainty .",
    "this benchmark is clearly achievable for a narrow range of experimental conditions .",
    "there is a much broader range of kinematics where the curve exceeds 0.04 , which corresponds to a 5% measurement of the asymmetry . to avoid contamination from @xmath44 ( arbitrarily keeping it below @xmath330 of the total asymmetry ) one should keep the incident energy above @xmath331 gev for forward angles , or @xmath332 gev at more backward angles .",
    "again , more detailed numbers can be extracted from tables  [ tableii ] and [ tableiii ] . at 3 gev and @xmath333 , for example , the expected statistical uncertainty in the measurement is @xmath334 , and the contributions from both @xmath286 and @xmath44 are each around 4% of the total asymmetry .",
    "a one percent extraction of @xmath63 would thus require knowledge of @xmath335 with better than 25% uncertainty at these kinematics .",
    "while achieving the latter for @xmath44 appears feasible ( see below ) , significant improvements in the present understanding of @xmath286 would appear necessary .",
    "if one seeks to determine @xmath44 , the required kinematic conditions are , of course , somewhat changed .",
    "the figure of merit must still be kept high ( _ i.e. _ the statistical uncertainty in the total measured asymmetry must be kept low ) .",
    "in addition , the relative contribution of @xmath44 to the asymmetry must be as large as possible relative to the statistical uncertainty in the total asymmetry .",
    "it must also be larger than the uncertainty in the background term @xmath286 . to illustrate these considerations ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ d3 - 1d ] @xmath44 as a function of @xmath85 for various incident energies .",
    "this figure clearly demonstrates that @xmath44 is enhanced at lower incident energies , as we argued from basic kinematic coefficients in section iii . in the figure ,",
    "the error bar is constructed by finding the standard deviation of the different results for the adler amplitudes obtained from table  [ tablei ] , and should be considered a crude lower bound on the theoretical uncertainty in this quantity .",
    "[ ad-3d ] shows @xmath44 as a function of both energy and scattering angle .",
    "again , we observe the simple energy - dependence , as well as the relative lack of sensitivity to scattering angle . tables  [ tableii ] and [ tableiii ] provide more detailed numbers for a variety of kinematics , for a single parameterization of the adler form factors .    in fig .",
    "[ adoda-3d ] , we plot @xmath336 , versus both incident energy , @xmath68 , and electron scattering angle , @xmath326 .",
    "here @xmath337 is the contribution to the asymmetry arising only from the resonant axial transition terms : @xmath338 the leading coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ alr1 ] ) .",
    "the kinematic region shown spans roughly what might be accessible at cebaf .",
    "selected numerical values are also collected in tables  [ tableii ] and [ tableiii ] . in order to extract @xmath44 with the greatest precision , at least three criteria must be satisfied : ( a ) @xmath339 must be as large as possible ; ( b ) systematic uncertainties must be controllable at the same level as @xmath340 ; ( c ) the contribution from @xmath44 must be considerably larger than that of @xmath286 in order to minimize the impact of uncertainties associated with the latter . from fig .",
    "[ adoda-3d ] it is clear the forward angles and moderate to high energies are favored . going to @xmath341 gev , however ,",
    "reduces @xmath340 to less than 1% , a level at which achieving similar systematic precision becomes problematic .",
    "similarly , the relative contributions of @xmath44 and @xmath286 become commensurate as @xmath68 increases beyond 2 gev",
    ".    a reasonable compromise among these considerations might be the following : incident energy in the range @xmath284 gev @xmath342 gev , scattering angle @xmath343 .",
    "the upper bound on energy keeps @xmath50 reasonably large in comparison with @xmath286 , and the smaller angles help keep the count rate , and thus the figure of merit , high . throughout this kinematic range , given our arbitrary set of experimental assumptions , @xmath344 stays below @xmath3455% ; @xmath337 is more than a factor of 2 larger than @xmath346 ; @xmath337 is larger than @xmath347 ; and @xmath337 stays bigger than 5% of the total asymmetry . at the optimal kinematics points , we find @xmath348 which implies a 25% measurement of the axial form factor is possible . under these conditions , the @xmath286 contribution is roughly 40% as large as that of @xmath44 , so that a 50% uncertainty in the background would not impair a 25% determination of the axial response .",
    "in this study , we have analyzed the pv @xmath1 transition with an eye toward a prospective measurement of the pv asymmetry .",
    "in particular , we have considered the sensitivity of @xmath51 to various scenarios for physics beyond the standard model  such as leptoquarks , additional neutral gauge bosons , and fermion compositeness  as well as to transition form factors of interest to hadron structure theory . after estimating the precision with which @xmath51 might be determined in a realistic experiment , we have also estimated the scale of background effects at the kinematics most suited for probing new electroweak physics or hadron structure with this process .    generally speaking",
    ", we find that , in order for @xmath52 to compete with atomic pv or elastic pv electron scattering as a low - energy new physics probe , a measurement at significantly better than one percent precision would be required",
    ". there do exist some new physics scenarios for which @xmath51 at the one percent level could provide useful isospin information , although a measurement of the elastic proton asymmetry would fulfill essentially the same purpose@xcite . even at the one percent level , however , a measurement would be experimentally challenging at best .",
    "furthermore , it appears that background processes are not sufficiently well understood to permit a separation of the isovector weak charge ( @xmath63 ) from the non - resonant background corrections ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "future experimental isospin decomposition of the em pion electroproduction process could ultimately allow a model - independent background subtraction with sufficient precision .",
    "the use of @xmath52 as a probe of hadron structure appears to be a more feasible prospect at present .",
    "a @xmath349 determination of the hadronic axial vector response , embedded in @xmath50 , could be carried out with realistic running times .",
    "furthermore , at reasonable kinematics for such a measurement , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath350 , @xmath351 gev , the backgrounds appear to be sufficiently under control .",
    "the axial response is dominated by the form factor ratio @xmath55 , the knowledge of which would complement information about the vector current transition form factors obtained form em processes . while a 25% determination of @xmath55 would not allow for a detailed discrimination among hadron structure model predictions , it would significantly improve upon knowledge obtained from charged current neutrino reactions and test model predictions at the level of the theoretical - experimental discrepancies arising in the vector current sector .",
    "a complete theoretical analysis of @xmath50 , including the effects of potentially large and theoretically uncertain radiative corrections associated with hadronic pv , awaits a future study .",
