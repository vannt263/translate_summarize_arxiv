    "measurements of isotopic ratios in the interstellar medium ( ism ) are used to infer the past history of chemical enrichment across the galaxy . both quiescent stellar evolution as well as explosive stellar processes",
    "are sources of carbon isotopes that enrich the ism . in our solar system the carbon isotopic ratio , @xmath0c/@xmath1c , is found to be 89 @xcite , thus providing a benchmark value dating back 4.6 billion years to the time of solar formation .",
    "red giant stars are prodigious converters of @xmath0c into @xmath1c , and their ongoing mass loss is a major factor in the continuous lowering of the 12-to-13 ratio in the ism .",
    "for example , observations of cn , co , and cs in highly - evolved agb and post - agb stars show @xmath0c/@xmath1c values from 70 down to 30 in photospheric layers and in circumstellar shells that are being injected into the ism @xcite .",
    "planetary nebulae are later stages of low - mass stellar evolution , showing very low values of @xmath0co/@xmath1co from 31 down to 2 @xcite , or from 23 down to 9 for the sample in @xcite , as well as low 12-to-13 values from observations of @xcite .",
    "thus in the present - day , local ism we should find @xmath0c/@xmath1c values that are between the higher ( older ) solar system value and the lowest ( youngest ) values found in highly - evolved objects .    the 12-to-13 carbon ratio should change not only in time , but also in space . specifically",
    ", it is expected to increase monotonically with galactocentric distance owing to lower cumulative numbers of star formation generations and @xmath1c mass loss episodes that have occurred farther from the galactic center .",
    "this picture has been confirmed by ism studies employing the easily - detected mm - wave emission lines of @xmath0c- and @xmath1c - bearing molecules to infer @xmath0c/@xmath1c inside dense molecular clouds .",
    "observations of co @xcite and h@xmath6co @xcite show that the ratio of the @xmath0c - bearing molecules to their heavier counterparts are higher in the outer parts of the galactic disk than in its inner parts  see reviews by @xcite and @xcite , as well as the work of @xcite and @xcite , who observed mm - wave emission from cn in molecular clouds and derived a galactic gradient similar to that seen in co. however , appreciable scatter is found in the measured @xmath0c/@xmath1c at each galactocentric distance , which according to @xcite is providing evidence for actual source - to - source differences .",
    "averaging isotopic ratios from 13 sources in the local ism gives 69 @xmath8 6 , while the fit to the galactic gradient predicts @xmath0c/@xmath1c = 71 @xmath8 13 at the solar circle , indicating some 25% enrichment of @xmath1c relative to @xmath0c in the ism over the last 4.6 eons .",
    "another molecule used as a proxy for the @xmath0c/@xmath1c along diffuse and translucent sight lines is ch@xmath7 , which has been investigated primarily via its optical @xmath2@xmath3 transition at 4232.548  . after a period of initial confusion , published @xmath0ch@xmath7/@xmath1ch@xmath7 values eventually settled around an average value near 70 [ e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] , confirming that ch@xmath7 is not susceptible to fractionation because its formation occurs via non - thermal processes .",
    "thus ch@xmath7 provides confirmation that the @xcite average of 69 @xmath8 6 from mm - wave emission data of dense molecular cloud cores is a good indicator of @xmath0c/@xmath1c in the local ism .",
    "we shall , therefore , take the ambient value of @xmath0c/@xmath1c in the solar neighborhood to be 70 @xmath8 7 .    besides mm - wave probing of dense clouds and ch@xmath7 in much more tenuous lines of sight , there are other cases that confirm the ambient carbon isotopic ratio of 70 . in the vacuum uv ( vuv ) ,",
    "@xcite reported @xmath0co/@xmath1co = 73 @xmath8 12 toward x per ( hd 24534 ) , albeit with highly fractionated c@xmath9o / c@xmath10o and c@xmath9o / c@xmath11o values .",
    "@xcite reported 12-to-13 co ratios for six sight lines , five of which resulted in values that were consistent with 70 to within 2 @xmath12 .",
    "six out of seven @xmath1co sight lines in the sample of @xcite are consistent with unfractionated co at the same level of significance . in the near infrared ( nir ) , toward the dense cloud afgl 490",
    ", @xcite derived @xmath0co/@xmath1co = 86 @xmath8 49 , i.e. , indistinguishable from the ambient carbon ratio .",
    "the sight line toward the massive protostar ngc 7538 irs9 provided the first isotopic measurement of solid co in the ism .",
    "nir data presented in @xcite show that the ratio of @xmath0co ice to @xmath1co ice is 71 @xmath8 5 .",
    "moreover , this agreement is also displayed by ices of another c - bearing molecule , since @xmath0co@xmath6/@xmath1co@xmath6 = 80 @xmath8 11 along the same line of sight @xcite .",
    "as the examples above show , most isotopic carbon ratios are inferred from c - bearing molecular proxies , especially co , thanks to the larger isotopic shifts that are encountered in molecules . however , in the ism , carbon isotopic ratios that are derived via molecular proxies are sometimes found to be fractionated .",
    "two opposing effects are usually invoked to explain co fractionation away from the ambient @xmath0c/@xmath1c .",
    "an isotopic charge exchange ( ice ) reaction @xmath1c@xmath7 + @xmath0co @xmath13 @xmath0c@xmath7 + @xmath1co + 35 k @xcite works to lower the @xmath0co - to-@xmath1co ratio when a lower gas temperature and a high c@xmath7 abundance are present , while selective photodissociation ( spd ) in ultraviolet ( uv ) photon - dominated regions drives the ratio higher through self shielding by the more abundant isotopologue , i.e. , @xmath0co @xcite .",
    "deep inside dark molecular clouds no fractionation of co is expected because of the absence of both ionized carbon and uv photons .    in order to explore how well @xmath0co/@xmath1co in diffuse molecular clouds",
    "reflects the underlying 12-to-13 carbon ratio , we study its fractionation processes here in more detail through a larger sample of sight lines .",
    "it is important to verify that the 12-to-13 variations are source - related and not induced by systematic effects such as noise and modeling uncertainties .",
    "therefore , because the treatment of absorption along an infinitesimal beam is significantly less complicated than that of emission from a finite volume , and since the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) records high - quality spectra of a large number of saturated as well as optically - thin co bands per sight line , we are able to provide evidence for source - to - source variation in @xmath0co/@xmath1co , and consider photochemical fractionation as its cause .",
    "our sample includes 20 stars observed with stis at resolving power ( @xmath14 ) between 46,000 ( grating e140 m ) and 160,000 ( grating e140h ) and five stars that have _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ data from its goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) .",
    "although @xmath14 of the ghrs grating g160 m is the lowest in the current sample ( 19,000 ) , with proper sampling of weak and strong bands and with high enough signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , the data are very useful for robust modeling of co column densities .",
    "this was nicely demonstrated by @xcite who presented g160 m data for @xmath15 oph having s / n @xmath16 900 ( ! ) and by @xcite , who modeled co toward @xmath17 oph a and @xmath18 oph using g160 m data with s / n @xmath16 200 .",
    "these three stars were added to the sample , as well as hd 96675 and hd 154368 , which have ghrs spectra with only moderate s / n ; the results of their low-@xmath14 co modeling are less secure than for the rest of the sample .",
    "table 1 lists all 25 sight lines and gives stellar spectral types , apparent @xmath19 magnitudes , galactic coordinates , velocity corrections to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , reddening values , and heliocentric and galactocentric distances .",
    "the farthest target examined here is hd 177989 , which lies 5 kpc away .",
    "table 2 provides a listing of stis and ghrs data sets that were used in our analysis .",
    "also listed for each data set are grating and aperture used , s / n achieved , and @xmath14 , derived as a fitted parameter during co spectral syntheses . whenever repeated multiple exposures were available ,",
    "they were combined in wavelength space for improved s / n . in addition , when a feature ( band ) appeared in two adjacent orders , they were combined after correcting for any small wavelength inconsistencies .",
    "all reductions here were performed in irafand stsdas .",
    "all profile syntheses of co , as well as of h@xmath6 from spectra acquired with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopy explorer ( fuse ) _ , were carried out by y. s. with his simplex fortran code , ismod.f .",
    "for the determination of co column density ( @xmath20 ) we used oscillator strengths ( @xmath21-values ) for the @xmath2@xmath3 bands from @xcite , see also @xcite , which in a global sense have been verified to a level of a few percent by @xcite .",
    "simultaneous multi - parametric profile syntheses of all detected co bands for each sight line were employed in deriving @xmath20(@xmath0co ) , @xmath20(@xmath1co ) , and excitation temperatures ( @xmath22 ) , as well as observed radial velocity and fitted equivalent width ( @xmath23 ) for each band .",
    "cloud component structures from high-@xmath14 optical observations of ch @xmath44300 were available for 19 of the 22 sight lines analyzed here , but relative fractions and @xmath24-values of all components were allowed to vary ( i.e. , only velocity differences were left fixed during the fit ) .",
    "the remaining three cases without available ch component structures happen to be the sight lines with the lowest amounts of detected co , thus affording uncomplicated abundance determinations .",
    "detailed cloud structures and model results for ch and h@xmath6 will appear elsewhere . here ,",
    "values for @xmath25 of h@xmath6 and its excitation temperatures @xmath26 and @xmath27 will be quoted and analyzed .",
    "the important aspect of correctly handling any effects of line saturation was realized by including both very weak @xmath2@xmath3 bands with optical depth at line center of @xmath16 1 or less , which are sensitive mostly to the total co column density , as well as very strong @xmath2@xmath3 bands having @xmath21-values many times larger , which dictate how the cloud components should be modeled .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show two examples of multi - band fits toward hd 208266 of @xmath0co and @xmath1co , respectively . the wide spectral coverage and the high abundance of co along this sight line combine to give us the highest practical number ( 14 ) of usable absorption bands for @xmath0co , as well as seven consecutive bands of @xmath1co .",
    "in terms of optical depth ( @xmath28 ) , the model of @xmath0co shows that @xmath28 increases by a factor of 1150 from @xmath2@xmath3 ( 130 ) to @xmath2@xmath3 ( 20 ) , whereas @xmath28 of the @xmath1co bands varies by a factor of 20 . it should be noted that a full - scale fit of 14 @xmath2@xmath3 bands involves simultaneous modeling of the column density in 126 vuv transitions of co , when the model includes three parametrized excitation temperatures , or nine rotational transitions , per band",
    "this large number of modeled lines is what makes such a global fit very robust , even when the data ( from e140 m ) have moderate @xmath14 and s / n .    some details from these spectral fits , as well as model @xmath20 values ,",
    "are given in table 3 for @xmath0co and in table 4 for @xmath1co .",
    "results are listed for the two @xmath2@xmath3 bands ( denoted by @xmath29 ) that straddle the @xmath28 = 1 condition at the center of the r(0 ) line .",
    "these results include fitted @xmath23 , optical depth , and column density .",
    "the two bands are then used to infer the uncertainty on the derived column density by averaging their relative uncertainties in equivalent width and by assuming that the result is identical to the relative error in the column density .",
    "of course , the lower the optical depth , the better is this assumption .",
    "however , one can not use absorption bands that are too weak ( @xmath30 1 ) , because of the increasing influence of the noise relative to the decreasing signal from co.    the modeling methodology was to derive a cloud structure for the @xmath0co molecule , and then to apply it as a fixed structure during modeling of @xmath1co . the number of components , their relative fractions , and their velocity separations were all kept fixed , under the assumption that the two isotopologues reside in the same clumps of gas , with all components having identical 12-to-13 ratios for a given sight line .",
    "this assumption is kinematicaly verified , since the radial velocities of both species in our sample agree very well with each other .",
    "this agreement is shown in fig .",
    "3 , a plot of the difference @xmath31 against the heliocentric radial velocity scale of @xmath0co . with an average of @xmath320.2 @xmath8 0.4 km",
    "s@xmath33 , the scatter in this sample is consistent with a vanishing radial velocity difference between the two isotopologues .",
    "the 1 @xmath12 velocity dispersion of 0.4 km s@xmath33 is a small fraction of the resolution element for the data , being 0.22@xmath34 and 0.06@xmath34 for e140h and e140 m , respectively .",
    "although it is known that the stis line spread function ( lsf ) possesses weak wings ( see the stis handbook ) , we could not see any obvious signatures for such wings in the highest-@xmath14 data .",
    "therefore , a single gaussian was used to describe the instrumental profile of stis .",
    "this is is agreement with the findings of @xcite , who analyzed the unbinned ( but noisier and lacking proper flat - fielding ) raw spectral data .",
    "nevertheless , the stis handbook does show that the lsf wings have a larger role in the profile for wider slits .",
    "therefore , @xmath14 was treated as a fittable parameter during modeling , and it is apparent that @xmath14 is lower for e140h data taken through wider slits ( see fig .",
    "there is a good match between the range of @xmath14 found here and the range found by @xcite for the 0@xmath3509 slit , as well as his listed range for the smallest ( `` jenkins '' ) slit based on ground ( pre - launch ) measurements .",
    "furthermore , our tests show that a 15% error in @xmath14 affects the derived column density by only @xmath16 6% .",
    "since both @xmath20(@xmath0co ) and @xmath20(@xmath1co ) vary similarly in response to any @xmath14 change , derived isotopic ratios are affected at a level of @xmath36 3% according to these tests .",
    "the trend of lower @xmath14 with larger slit width is not limited to the e140h grating , as shown by modeling medium-@xmath14 data from the e140 m grating .",
    "three sight lines return an average of @xmath14 = 45,600 @xmath8 1,000 for the 0@xmath3506 slit , in excellent agreement with the value 46,000 given in @xcite . on the other hand , a couple of sight lines were observed through the wider 0@xmath352 slit , and their fitted @xmath14 values are 38,000 and 39,000 , i.e. , clearly corroborating the trend of decreasing @xmath14 with larger slit widths .",
    "the results presented in this paper reflect simultaneous modeling of all detectable @xmath2@xmath3 bands per sight line , but initial ismod.f fits of certain sight lines did not use all available bands .",
    "it is of interest to compare the latest and most extensive fits with less ambitious initial modeling to learn about the dependence of model results on the number of bands being fitted simultaneously .",
    "@xcite modeled a four - component cloud structure of @xmath20(@xmath0co ) and @xmath20(@xmath1co ) toward hd 24534 using the strongest and weakest of only seven @xmath2@xmath3 bands that were available from the stis o648o1213 data sets , as well as any available intersystem bands . for comparison and completeness",
    ", we obtained and analyzed the stis o66p012 data sets from the _ hst _ archive and modeled a total of 12 @xmath2@xmath3 bands toward x per , using all four e140h data sets . keeping a four - component cloud model ,",
    "the fit returned @xmath20(@xmath0co ) = ( 1.58 @xmath8 0.04 ) @xmath37 10@xmath9 @xmath38 , which is 12% higher than the value in @xcite .",
    "however , re - synthesizing the @xmath1co bands toward x per returned a new column density of 1.55 @xmath37 10@xmath39 @xmath38 , which was lower by 20% than the @xcite value .",
    "this newer fit was based on 9 bands covering a robust range of optical depth and @xmath21-values .",
    "a closer inspection revealed that the weaker bands were not being fitted correctly , showing as excess of observed absorption relative to the model .",
    "we , therefore , relaxed the usual method of keeping the component structure that was derived from @xmath0co fixed during @xmath1co fits , by allowing the @xmath24-values to vary during the synthesis .",
    "this resulted in a better fit to the data , yielding a larger @xmath20(@xmath1co ) , albeit 4% below the value in @xcite .",
    "thus our published value ( 73 @xmath8 12 ) for @xmath0co/@xmath1co is updated here to 85 @xmath8 5 , or higher by 1.0 @xmath12 . since more bands were used in the latest fit , its results should be more secure than before .",
    "the combination of high co column density , @xmath20(@xmath0co ) @xmath40 10@xmath9 @xmath38 and @xmath20(@xmath1co ) @xmath41 10@xmath39 @xmath38 , and high s / n in observed low-@xmath29 ( stronger ) bands of @xmath1co , is what allowed us to detect the anomaly in the first place and then to treat it .",
    "both @xmath0co and @xmath1co are still assumed to reside in the same clumps of gas , albeit with different line widths .",
    "another option , that of allowing a fit of cloud component fractions , would have explored a new territory of variable isotopic ratios among clumps of gas , which we decided not to pursue at the present time .    toward hd 203374a ,",
    "we previously published two @xmath20(@xmath0co ) values based on the five @xmath2@xmath3 bands ( 70 ) through ( 110 ) from the e140h data set , together with the @xmath42@xmath3 ( 00 ) band from lower-@xmath14 _ fuse _ data , which provided the high-@xmath28 leverage for the ismod.f synthesis @xcite . here , the much more extensive set of bands available in the e140 m ( lower-@xmath14 ) data set was analyzed .",
    "a simultaneous fit of 112 transitions in 13 @xmath2@xmath3 bands , ( 00 ) through ( 120 ) , returned a value for @xmath20(@xmath0co ) only 6% higher than @xcite , or a value that agrees perfectly with @xcite .",
    "this good agreement demonstrates that one need not resort to the highest-@xmath14 available ( e.g , through e140h ) as long as there is an adequate and robust coverage of many bands from medium-@xmath14 ( e140 m ) exposures .",
    "since relatively little has been done concerning uv data on @xmath1co in the past , most of the common sight lines involve comparisons of @xmath0co results ( see table 5 ) .",
    "previously published @xmath1co sight lines with _",
    "observations include @xmath15 oph @xcite , x per @xcite , and @xmath17 oph  a and @xmath18 oph @xcite , all modeled with ismod.f .",
    "two recent studies by @xcite and @xcite investigated @xmath0co , @xmath1co , and h@xmath6 along diffuse and translucent sight lines .",
    "lines of sight with detections of @xmath1co in the two studies amounted to 6/23 and 7/10 of the whole samples , respectively , of which four targets were common to both .",
    "together , these two studies introduced six sight lines with previously unpublished _",
    "data for @xmath1co : hd 27778 , hd 177989 , hd 203532 , hd 206267 , hd 207198 , hd 210121 , and hd 210839 .",
    "the current sample presents independent data reduction and analysis of 22 @xmath1co sight lines , of which 15 have no previously published @xmath0co - to-@xmath1co results , bringing the total number of sight lines with detectable @xmath1co based on _ hst _ data from 11 to 26 .",
    "@xcite modeled their data with a single cloud component , resulting in a single `` effective '' @xmath24-value for all their sight lines .",
    "furthermore , instead of using a self - fitting code , @xcite created a grid of models and then chose the values of @xmath20 , @xmath43 , and @xmath24 that best described the data . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite incorporated a profile - fitting code with multi - component cloud structures from high-@xmath14 optical spectra of ch and cn , much like our usual method of analysis .",
    "we are convinced that the latter methodology results in more realistic characterization of each line of sight , as is evidenced from the overall larger uncertainties associated with the results of @xcite . both @xcite and @xcite employed the co @xmath21-values listed in @xcite , which are the values from @xcite .",
    "thus no re - scaling was needed for this comparison with our results , which are also based on the same set of @xmath21-values . only a single star from @xcite ( hd 210121 )",
    "is not included in the current sample because there is a very limited coverage by ghrs exposures . by not including literature results our entire sample",
    "is kept as homogeneous as possible in terms of data reduction , measurements , and ismod.f spectrum synthesis fits .",
    "table 5 shows that @xmath0co/@xmath1co results for the seven common sight lines are in agreement to within 1.5 @xmath12 , with the sole exception of the @xcite value for x per owing to improper input cloud structure during modeling @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows log @xmath20(@xmath1co ) versus log @xmath20(@xmath0co ) for all sight lines .",
    "the slope corresponding to @xmath0c/@xmath1c = 70 is shown , together with its 1 @xmath12 range , as well as the slopes of 0.5 and 2.0 times the ratio of 70 .",
    "the values of @xmath0co/@xmath1co are seen to be centered along the line @xmath0c/@xmath1c = 70 , showing considerable scatter but mostly within the factor - of-2 range relative to 70 , i.e. , within 35 to 140 .    another view is provided by fig . 6 , which shows a histogram of the current vuv @xmath0co/@xmath1co values , as well as distributions via other detection methods and of other c - bearing molecules .",
    "this vuv sample of co ratios is at the bottom , showing a distribution that is centered near the ambient carbon isotopic ratio ( 70 ) with roughly equal numbers of sight lines having lower or higher values .",
    "table 6 shows that @xmath0co/@xmath1co in diffuse molecular clouds varies between 37 @xmath8 8 and 167 @xmath8 25 , a factor of 4.5 @xmath8 1.2 .",
    "the almost symmetric distribution is betrayed by 11 sight lines with 12-to-13 ratios below 70 and by 14 sight lines with values above 70 .",
    "six uv sight lines , all common with this sample , were analyzed by @xcite and yielded @xmath0co/@xmath1co values over a narrow range of 49 @xmath8 15 to 68 @xmath8 31 . for a more proper comparison ,",
    "the same six targets here returned values between 41 @xmath8 7 and 85 @xmath8 5 , in very good agreement with @xcite . however , the sample of @xcite is dominated by larger 12-to-13 uncertainties that obscure any possible source - to - source variations , whereas here we are able to discern source - to - source variations thanks to smaller measurement and modeling uncertainties .",
    "another sample of six uv sight lines from _ hst _ data in @xcite shows co isotopic values between 46 @xmath8 6 and 79 @xmath8 12 for five sight lines common with this sample , from which the range is between 42 @xmath89 and 85 @xmath8 5 , revealing very good agreement as well .",
    "table 6 also lists the isotopic ratios normalized by the carbon ratio , or @xmath44 in terms of @xmath45 , co isotopic values are found between 0.5 and 2.4 , yet very well centered on the ambient carbon isotopic value , or @xmath45 = 1 .",
    "this distribution is consistent with @xmath0c/@xmath1c being the `` parental '' distribution for the co isotopic ratios .",
    "theoretical models @xcite predict ambient isotopic co ratios for diffuse clouds , and variable ratios that respond to the changing uv flux along a path into a more opaque cloud .",
    "yet the same models fail to predict the observed column densities of co along diffuse sight lines .",
    "better correspondence may occur once new measurements of @xmath21-values of rydberg transitions of co ( @xmath46 4.4 ) are incorporated by such modeling efforts .",
    "an examination of co isotopic deviations from 70 shows that 14/25 of sight lines agree with the value of ambient @xmath0c/@xmath1c at the level of @xmath47 1 @xmath12 , and that three more sight lines agree with the unfractionated value to within 2 @xmath12 .",
    "thus 32% of sight lines have values of @xmath0co/@xmath1co that are significantly ( @xmath40 3 @xmath12 ) different from the carbon isotopic value . out of these eight sight lines , three have co that is fractionated upward : x per = 85 @xmath8 5 , @xmath15 per = 108 @xmath8 5 , and @xmath15 oph = 167 @xmath8 25 ( in order of increasing @xmath45 ) , presumably owing to more effective self shielding of @xmath0co against photodissociation .",
    "the five other sight lines in order of decreasing @xmath45 are : hd 207538 = 51 @xmath8 6 , hd 207198 = 48 @xmath8 8 , hd 206267 = 42 @xmath8 9 , hd 203532 = 41 @xmath8 7 , and hd 154368 = 37 @xmath8 8 .",
    "these exhibit fractionation in @xmath1co , presumably owing to a larger role of the ice reaction with c@xmath7 that enhances the relative abundance of @xmath1co .",
    "@xcite also found co fractionated toward hd 206267 , with @xmath0co/@xmath1co = 46 @xmath8 6 .",
    "the first 12-to-13 vuv study of co based solely on _ hst _ data was provided by @xcite , who found @xmath0co/@xmath1co to be 167 @xmath8 25 toward @xmath15 oph .",
    "[ previously , @xcite derived a 12-to-13 ratio of 150 @xmath8 27 along the same sight line using ghrs data and iue results . ] furthermore , two more sight lines in ophiuchus did indicate high uv ratios as reported by @xcite , who found 12-to-13 ratios of 125 @xmath8 23 toward @xmath17 oph a and 117 @xmath8 35 toward @xmath18 oph .",
    "when such initial uv reports of highly fractionated co came out they seemed to be extraordinary .",
    "now the present distribution serves to show that nothing extraordinary is happening even along the line of sight toward @xmath15 oph .",
    "although it still shows the highest @xmath0co fractionation ( factor of 2.4 @xmath8 0.4 ) , another sight line , that of hd 154368 , has @xmath1co fractionated to the greatest extent of 1.9 @xmath8 0.4 , while six other sight lines were listed above as fractionated to lesser degrees .",
    "thus uv data toward diffuse / translucent sight lines is showing that relative to the local isotopic ratio of carbon , co can be fractionated upward or downward by a factor of @xmath36 2 . for translucent sight lines , @xcite models",
    "can easily duplicate downward , but not upward , fractionations by about 2 , showing the need to improve upon self shielding computations for @xmath0co .",
    "we now explore possible relationships between the observed values of @xmath0co/@xmath1co and the other observables that characterize the ism",

    "however , when the more abundant co molecule incorporates most of the @xmath1c atoms from the ambient gas , the 12-to-13 ratio of other molecular species , such as cn and h@xmath6co increases , producing fractionation opposite to that of co. two sight lines offer evidence for this effect happening in cn : toward @xmath15 oph , @xcite measured @xmath0cn/@xmath1cn = 35 @xmath8 11 , whereas @xcite determined @xmath0co/@xmath1co = 167 @xmath8 25 ; as well as toward hd 154368 , where @xcite found the cn 12-to-13 ratio to be 101 @xmath8 12 , and this paper shows that the co 12-to-13 ratio is 37 @xmath8 8 .",
    "thus these two sight lines show cn to have an opposite sense of fractionation to that of co , a situation that arises when the more abundant co controls the availability of @xmath1c atoms . as a result of their anti - correlation both co and cn 12-to-13 values from uv determinations",
    "are seen to vary within a factor - of-2 range about the reference value of @xmath0c/@xmath1c = 70 .",
    "simultaneously , @xmath0ch@xmath7/@xmath1ch@xmath7 values are not fractionated : 68 @xmath8 5 toward @xmath15 oph @xcite and 58 @xmath8 8 toward hd 154368 @xcite .",
    "thus the cn and co isotopic ratios along each sight line are found on opposite sides of the ch@xmath7 ( and the ambient carbon ) isotopic ratio .",
    "another sight line suggests a high value of @xmath0cn/@xmath1cn , namely 122 @xmath8 33 toward hd 21483 @xcite , but no information is available concerning the @xmath0co/@xmath1co in that direction .",

    "given the smaller level of co fractionation and the relatively large uncertainties in the cn isotopic ratio , any final determination will have to be based on data with better s / n .",

    "having indistinguishable @xmath22 values provides additional strong support that both co isotopologues are well mixed and are subject to the same physical conditions .",
    "the smaller samples of @xcite and @xcite also indicated the same @xmath22 for the two co isotopologues within the stated uncertainties .",
    "the mm - wave absorption survey of co @xcite tabulated @xmath22 values that provide the averages 6.2 @xmath8 1.2 and 5.6 @xmath8 0.7 k for @xmath0co and @xmath1co , respectively , also showing them to be identical within the uncertainties .",
    "these mm - wave - derived @xmath22 values are higher than the uv - derived values , suggesting that denser gas is being observed and that the two samples may be different .",
    "the kinetic temperature of the gas is well approximated by @xmath80(h@xmath6 ) , because h@xmath6 is a homonuclear molecule , so that the relative level populations of the ortho and para ground states are controlled by collisions characterized by @xmath60 . from the 22 sight lines with h@xmath6 data in our @xmath1co sample , the average @xmath80(h@xmath6 ) = 60 @xmath8 8 k. this value is lower by 17 and 8 k , respectively , than @xmath80 averages of 77 @xmath8 17 k found by @xcite , and 68 @xmath8 15 k from @xcite , both of which were h@xmath6 surveys unrelated to the presence of co. it appears that h@xmath6 ( and thus , the gas in general ) is colder along sight lines with detectable amounts of @xmath1co .",
    "since all targets in this paper were selected _ a priori _ to show measurable amounts of @xmath1co in their spectra , this selection criterion and the presence of lower kinetic gas temperatures seem to be related . in order to verify that @xmath80 is lower when @xmath1co is present",
    ", we must analyze sight lines from surveys dedicated to co.    @xcite presented a literature compilation with 38 @xmath80(h@xmath6 ) values from co - bearing sight lines , yielding an average @xmath80 of 69 @xmath8 16 k. however , splitting the sample into sight lines with or without detected amounts of @xmath1co , we find that @xmath80 = 56 @xmath8 8 k from 12 directions with @xmath1co , whereas @xmath80 = 76 @xmath8 15 k from 26 sight lines without detected @xmath1co , or @xmath87@xmath80 = 20 k. @xcite found an average @xmath80 of 74 @xmath8 24 k for 23 co sight lines .",
    "when we split their sample according to @xmath1co detectability , six @xmath1co directions have @xmath80 = 58 @xmath8 8 k , while 17 without @xmath1co have @xmath80 = 80 @xmath8 25 k , or @xmath87@xmath80 = 22 k. this shows that sight lines with @xmath1co from both co samples have average @xmath80 values that are in extremely good agreement with our average of 60 @xmath8 8 k. furthermore , the selection of sight lines with detectable amounts of @xmath1co appears to sample h@xmath6 molecules that are colder by @xmath49 20 k , or equivalently , regions of ambient gas with @xmath60 that is @xmath49 20 k lower than along other directions .",
    "in fact , this clear separation of sight lines into two groups according to their @xmath1co abundance can provide an explanation for the lower @xmath88 average for @xmath80 found by @xcite relative to the @xmath89 value from @xcite .",
    "ten of the 23 sight lines in the @xcite sample have detectable amounts of @xmath1co ; thus 43% of that sample is expected to show the presence of colder gas .",
    "the 13 sight lines without @xmath1co provide @xmath80 = 73 @xmath8 16 k , whereas the ones with @xmath1co have @xmath80 = 60 @xmath8 9 k , i.e. , a difference of 13 k. one can observe that the colder value of @xmath80 is in excellent agreement with the average @xmath80 of our @xmath1co sight lines , while the warmer value of @xmath80 agrees nicely with the average @xmath80 from @xcite , which by inspection had 55 lines without detections of @xmath1co , averaging @xmath80 = 79 @xmath8 15 k. this @xmath89 sample included only six sight lines currently known to have @xmath1co that , unsurprisingly , yield the low @xmath80 = 52 @xmath8 7 k , or 27 k below the value for clouds without @xmath1co . since the @xcite sample was designed to explore translucent sight lines with higher @xmath79 and higher @xmath20(h@xmath6 ) , such physical and chemical conditions seem to promote the formation and survival of detectable amounts of @xmath1co .",
    "in fact , the current sample has very similar characteristics to that of @xcite : average value of @xmath79 is 1.4 @xmath8 0.5 versus 1.6 @xmath8 0.7 , and average value of log @xmath20(h@xmath6 ) = 20.7 @xmath8 0.2 versus 20.8 @xmath8 0.2 .",
    "it is also interesting that @xcite remarked that nine @xmath89 sight lines with log @xmath20(h@xmath6 ) = 20.7 averaged to 55 @xmath8 8 k , reinforcing the interconnectedness between higher h@xmath6 column density , lower gas kinetic temperature , and the presence of diatomic molecules with heavy elements such as @xmath1co ( see below ) .",
    "the inverse correspondence between the presence of @xmath1co and @xmath80 may be used to predict detectable abundances of @xmath1co along sight lines that have @xmath80(h@xmath6 ) @xmath36 65 k.    a few of the directions with @xmath1co analyzed in this paper were selected from a larger sample of co sight lines for which we also determined @xmath80(h@xmath6 ) , based on cloud structures from newly acquired high-@xmath14 mcd and eso optical spectra .",
    "for the sake of consistency , the average @xmath60 for the gas along all other sight lines should also be established . yet again , 30 directions without @xmath1co return @xmath80 = 79 @xmath8 13 k , whereas the four with @xmath1co yield @xmath80 = 59 @xmath8 10 k , showing what by now seems to be the `` canonical '' @xmath87@xmath80 of @xmath49 20 k between the two groups of sight lines as sorted by the presence of @xmath1co .",
    "we also inspected the literature survey in @xcite according to the presence or absence of carbon - bearing diatomic molecules other than co and found that @xmath1co is not the only molecule revealing two groupings of cooler or warmer h@xmath6 gas .",
    "nine sight lines without detected amounts of c@xmath6 yielded @xmath80(h@xmath6 ) = 83 @xmath8 16 k , whereas 17 directions with c@xmath6 returned the average 57 @xmath8 9 k , or @xmath87@xmath80 = 26 k. the agreement of @xmath80 from c@xmath6 sight lines with the @xmath1co sight lines in @xmath46 4.8 is outstanding . as for cn , 10 sight lines without detectable amounts of this molecule average to @xmath80(h@xmath6 ) = 79 @xmath8 13 k , while 28 directions with detections provide 66 @xmath8 16 k , or @xmath87@xmath80 = 13 k. these results further enhance the correspondences found between co , cn , and c@xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "nevertheless , lowering @xmath60 from 80 k along directions without @xmath1co to 60 k along those with @xmath1co brings about a decrease of only 15% in @xmath0co/@xmath1co .",
    "however , owing to a much more extended sight - line distribution of h@xmath6 in comparison with co , @xmath80(h@xmath6 ) may not provide the best indication of @xmath60 for @xmath1co .",
    "the more concentrated distribution of heavier molecules has been shown to exist for cn and co @xcite , as well as for c@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these three molecules contain two heavy elements and are found in denser and colder clumps of gas with @xmath60 that is better estimated from @xmath22 = @xmath90 of rotational populations in c@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite tabulated @xmath90 values for c@xmath6 and mentioned that they are lower than @xmath80(h@xmath6 ) .",

    "this translates into a factor of @xmath16 2 higher efficiency for the ice conversion of @xmath1c@xmath7 into @xmath1co , which can nicely account for the those vuv sight lines with co that is observed to be fractionated by the same factor .",
    "the following assumes that the population of higher rotational levels of h@xmath6 can be described by a steady state relation between the formation of rotationally - excited h@xmath6 molecules and uv pumping from the ground state on one hand , and level depopulation by spontaneous radiative emission on the other .",

    "in fact , since both @xmath68(h ) and @xmath62 have much higher derived values than those determined in the modeling based on cn chemistry ( table 6 ) , the conclusion is that co is not associated with regions containing rotationally excited h@xmath6 .",
    "this confirms that co is concentrated in denser and colder regions that are much less extended than the distribution of h@xmath6 , but are closely related to the conditions inferred from analysis of cn absorption ( @xmath46 4.5 ) .",

    "@xcite note that their fitted @xmath22 values for the cool components of @xmath0co ( seen in the transitions with @xmath81 @xmath36 6 ) are about twice as high as @xmath22 values of @xmath1co , owing to photon trapping in @xmath0co transitions .",
    "since the inferred @xmath20 values are proportional to @xmath22 , the results show isotopic ratios about twice as high as the ambient value of 70 .",
    "studies of mm - wave _ absorption _ toward extragalactic sources have yielded molecular isotopic ratios appreciably lower than the ambient @xmath0c/@xmath1c .",
    "@xcite found 59 @xmath8 2 to be the weighted average of 12-to-13 obtained from absorption profiles of three non - co carbon - bearing species : hco@xmath7 , hcn , and hnc .",
    "the derived average included six absorption components mostly toward a single galactic direction , whereas one component that yielded h@xmath0cn / h@xmath1cn = 170 @xmath8 51 was too anomalous to be included in the average .",
    "@xcite analyzed five sight lines and found @xmath20(@xmath0co)/@xmath20(@xmath1co ) to range from 15.3 @xmath8 2.1 to 54 @xmath8 13 .",
    "four sight lines from this highly - fractionated sample show at a significance better than 4 @xmath12 that @xmath1co is enhanced by up to a factor of 4.6 , which compares favorably with predicted model values for very cold clouds @xcite .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , such mm - wave observations are difficult to interpret owing to long path lengths and complicated cloud structures .",
    "their lowest 12-to-13 co ratios ( down to 15 ) refer to the sight line toward b0355 + 508 , which presents five kinematic components along a very long path through the molecular layer of the galactic disk .",
    "we estimate the upper limit on the path length to be 8.7 kpc from 243 pc / sin(11@xmath97 ) based on the 3 @xmath12 scale height of the molecular component of the ism @xcite . since this sight line is 150  away from the direction to the galactic center , resulting in an upper limit of 16.6 kpc for @xmath98",
    ", its very low @xmath0co/@xmath1co values stand in stark contrast to the galactic gradient of 12-to-13 being proportional to @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "we surmise that very cold gas is being probed so that the ice reaction is even more effective in producing @xmath1co than in more local and warmer gas .",
    "this would be consistent with the findings of @xcite for molecular gas in the outer galaxy .",
    "@xcite , while reporting the first mm - wave detection of @xmath1c@xmath11o emission in the ism , also reported c@xmath11o/@xmath1c@xmath11o of 65 @xmath8 11 toward the molecular cloud core @xmath17 oph c , using beam sizes of 25  to 50 .",
    "this unfractionated value sharply contrasts with the @xcite vuv value of @xmath0co/@xmath1co = 125 @xmath8 23 in absorption toward the star @xmath17 oph a. a way to reconcile this difference in results from the two spectral regimes is to attribute it to the different volumes being probed by the observing techniques .",
    "the vuv isotopic ratio probes the outer parts of the cloud that absorb the stellar and interstellar radiation , sampling @xmath20(@xmath0co ) of @xmath99 @xmath38 that is sufficient for self shielding by @xmath0co , but leaves @xmath1co molecules subjected to high uv flux levels that drive @xmath45 up to 1.8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mm - wave c@xmath11o - to-@xmath1c@xmath11o ratio tells us that deeper inside the cloud , where @xmath20(@xmath0co ) , @xmath20(@xmath1co ) , and @xmath20(c@xmath10o ) are @xmath49 10@xmath96 , 10@xmath11 , and 10@xmath9 @xmath38 , respectively , there is no uv flux and , thus , no co fractionation .",
    "since the volume explored by uv absorption lines has a column density @xmath16 10@xmath92 smaller than that of the volume explored by mm - wave emission , the star @xmath17 oph a is either situated in front of the bulk of the co , or is shining through the outer envelope of the molecular cloud core .",
    "we surveyed the _ hst _ archive to assemble a sample of 25 diffuse and translucent ( i.e. , 0.65 @xmath47 @xmath79 @xmath47 2.58 ) sight lines with absorption signatures from @xmath1co .",
    "most of these sight lines are consistent with no fractionation of co away from the ambient @xmath0c/@xmath1c = 70 , while 32% are found to be significantly fractionated .",
    "two photochemical processes compete in driving @xmath0co/@xmath1co away from 70 : spd in diffuse clouds destroys less of @xmath0co thanks to self shielding , whereas the ice reaction enhances the abundance of @xmath1co in colder clouds .",
    "the former cases are confirmed by the presence of h@xmath6 absorption lines that are vibrationally excited by the enhanced uv radiation field .",
    "three regimes of @xmath0co column density were seen to correspond to varying contributions from spd and ice in affecting co fractionation . in the lowest-@xmath20(@xmath0co )",
    "regime , 12-to-13 values are @xmath40 70 owing to self shielding by @xmath0co and insignificant competition from ice . in the middle regime , where @xmath0co/@xmath1co revealed the lowest values in the uv , as well as an overlap with mm - wave absorption results ,",
    "the presence of c@xmath7 allows the ice reaction to produce efficiently higher amounts of @xmath1co .",
    "finally , the highest-@xmath20(@xmath0co ) regime presents the deepest part of the clouds , where shielding applies to both isotopologues , resulting in @xmath0co/@xmath1co values close to 70 .    the simple model of the fractionation , based on the @xcite formula for @xmath45 , allowed us to evaluate the basic ingredients that affect fractionation , leading to a preference of the @xcite value for the forward reaction between @xmath1c@xmath7 and @xmath0co over that published by @xcite and indicating the need to increase co self shielding functions by @xmath16 2 .",
    "however , this simplified model should be followed by more detailed computations that will include the newly available set of larger ( also by @xmath16 2 ) @xmath21-values of co.    it now appears that the detection of @xmath1co can be statistically associated with the presence of cold gas .",
    "the analysis of @xmath80(h@xmath6 ) showed that h@xmath6 is cooler by about 20 k along sight lines that possess detectable amounts of @xmath1co .",
    "furthermore , two other carbon - bearing molecules agree with this scenario , since both cn and c@xmath6 are also associated with h@xmath6 that is colder .",
    "when ice is the sole fractionating process , @xmath60 of 60 k will establish an equilibrium value of @xmath0co/@xmath1co @xmath49 40 , which agrees very well with the lowest isotopic values in the present vuv sample .",
    "however , no clear correlation is seen between the 12-to-13 ratio and @xmath60 , presumably because it is masked by the competing route to fractionation , namely spd , that affects each sight line to a different extent .",
    "besides narrow @xmath24-values that are common to co and cn absorption lines , the opposite fractionation relationship that was found between @xmath0co/@xmath1co and @xmath0cn/@xmath1cn also supports the coexistence of cn and co. together with c@xmath6 , all three molecules are associated with colder h@xmath6 gas .",
    "the inferred coexistence of co , cn , and c@xmath6 in denser and colder portions of a cloud promotes @xmath90(c@xmath6 ) instead of @xmath80(h@xmath6 ) as the better probe of @xmath60 of the gas in which @xmath1co is found .",
    "when @xmath60 @xmath49 30 k is assumed , the ice reaction for co fractionation will achieve an equilibrium value of @xmath49 20 in the absence of spd . although we do not see such low values here , similar values have been found for co in mm - wave absorption studies @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the mm - wave sample is , indeed , free of uv photodissociation effects , and whether the vuv co isotopic ratios happen to hover above @xmath49 40 owing to competition from spd .",
    "fractionation prevents molecular proxies from perfectly tracking the atomic carbon ratios , thus direct results concerning the distribution of @xmath0c and @xmath1c will eventually have to come from observations of atomic forms of carbon .",
    "a few steps in this direction were taken by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "along two lines of sight only a few arcminutes apart and near the trapezium cluster at the center of the orion nebula , @xcite detected 158 @xmath100 m emission from both @xmath0c@xmath7 and @xmath1c@xmath7 , whereas @xcite observed 809 ghz emission from both @xmath0c@xmath101 and @xmath1c@xmath101 .",
    "the two studies yielded the same ratio for @xmath0c/@xmath1c : 58 @xmath8 6 and 58 @xmath8 12 , respectively .",
    "@xcite also measured @xmath0c@xmath10o/@xmath1c@xmath10o = 75 @xmath8 9 .",
    "all three results agree with the solar neighborhood value of 70 , considering the quoted uncertainties .",
    "still , even @xmath0c/@xmath1c may get modified by competition with molecules , especially co , for the availability of @xmath1c , so that a fuller account of the carbon budget will have to include all of its isotopes in all atomic and molecular combinations , and in all stages of ionization , to properly deduce the details of the photochemistry involved . on the theoretical front ,",
    "expanding photodissociation and ice predictions to molecules other than co ( e.g. , cn ) would allow a better understanding of isotopic results that are being assembled for various sight lines .",

    "<S> most sight lines have 12-to-13 isotopic ratios that are not significantly different from the local value of 70 for @xmath0c/@xmath1c , which is based on mm - wave observations of rotational lines in emission from co and h@xmath6co inside dense molecular clouds , as well as on results from optical measurements of ch@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> five of the 25 sight lines are found to be fractionated toward lower 12-to-13 values , while three sight lines in the sample are fractionated toward higher ratios , signaling the predominance of either isotopic charge exchange or selective photodissociation , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> there are no obvious trends of the @xmath0co - to-@xmath1co ratio with physical conditions such as gas temperature or density , yet @xmath0co/@xmath1co does vary in a complicated manner with the column density of either co isotopologue , owing to varying levels of competition between isotopic charge exchange and selective photodissociation in the fractionation of co. finally , rotational temperatures of h@xmath6 show that all sight lines with detected amounts of @xmath1co pass through gas that is on average colder by 20 k than the gas without @xmath1co . </S>",
    "<S> this colder gas is also sampled by cn and c@xmath6 molecules , the latter indicating gas kinetic temperatures of only 28 k , enough to facilitate an efficient charge exchange reaction that lowers the value of @xmath0co/@xmath1co . </S>"
