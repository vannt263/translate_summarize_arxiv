    "quantum mechanics is known to differ from classical mechanics due to the existence of the position  momentum uncertainty relation by heisenberg  @xcite . the uncertainty relation containing the correlation of the position and momentum",
    "was found by robertson  @xcite and schrdinger  @xcite .",
    "there exists the uncertainty relation of the position and momentum for mixed quantum states  @xcite .",
    "new kinds of the uncertainty relations were obtained by trifonov  @xcite .",
    "extensions of the uncertainty relations of @xcite for mixed states were found by karelin  @xcite .",
    "review of the uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics is given in @xcite .    there",
    "exist specific uncertainty relations called `` entropic uncertainty relations '' based on the notion of shannon entropy and information  @xcite .",
    "these relations , which read as inequalities for entropy associated with the position - and - momentum probability distributions , were discussed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "recently a new formulation of quantum mechanics where the quantum states are described by tomographic - probability distributions ( instead of the wave function or density matrices ) was suggested  @xcite . for a system with continuous degrees of freedom ,",
    "such probability is the symplectic tomogram of the quantum state  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding symplectic tomographic entropy was introduced for quantum states in @xcite and in signal analysis in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the symplectic entropy was discussed for the bec solitons , in view of the tomogram of the solution to gross ",
    "pitaevskii equation . a general approach to quantum information including the application of different kinds of tomographic entropies was developed in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this study is to establish a new kind of entropic uncertainty relations formulated as inequality for the entropy associated with the symplectic tomogram of the quantum state of a system with continuous degrees of freedom .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section [ sect2 ] , a review of known entropic uncertainty relations for systems with continuous variables is presented while , in section [ sect3 ] ,",
    "the symplectic - tomography approach is discussed .",
    "entropic inequalities for symplectic entropy are studied in section [ sect4 ] and examples of new inequalities for the gaussian packets ( squeezed states ) and soliton solution of gross  pitaevskii equation ( bose  einstein condensates ) are given in section [ sect5 ] .",
    "finally , conclusions are summarized in section [ sect6 ] .",
    "in the context of information theory , entropy is related to an arbitrary probability - distribution function  @xcite .",
    "for example , given the probability distribution @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a discrete random variable , i.e. , @xmath2 together with the normalization condition @xmath3 one has , by definition , the entropy @xmath4    in quantum mechanics , the discrete probability distributions are standard ingredients in the description of spin ( see , e.g. , tomographic probability of spin states in @xcite and related entropy for spin tomograms in @xcite ) .    for continuous variables ,",
    "the wave function @xmath5 provides the probability - distribution density @xmath6 the corresponding entropy reads ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath7    in the momentum representation , one has the wave function @xmath8 the corresponding entropy related to the momentum - probability density @xmath9 reads @xmath10    it is worthy noting that one can construct entropies @xmath11 and @xmath12 not only in quantum mechanics .",
    "if the function @xmath5 is replaced by a signal function @xmath13 depending on time @xmath14 , the function @xmath15 is replaced by the function @xmath16 describing the signal spectrum .    in this case , the entropy of the signal @xmath17 and its spectrum @xmath18 provide some information characteristics of the signal .    from mathematical point of view",
    ", there exists the correlation of entropies @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath19 and @xmath20 , since the function @xmath5 @xmath21 $ ] determines the fourier component @xmath15 @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "this means that the entropies @xmath11 and @xmath12 have to obey some constrains .",
    "these constrains are entropic uncertainty relations ( some inequalities ) .    for the one - mode system ,",
    "the inequality reads ( see @xcite , p.  28 ) @xmath23 or @xmath24    for the gaussian wave functions ( gaussian signals ) describing the states without correlations of the position and momentum , e.g. , the ground state of the harmonic oscillator @xmath25 one has @xmath26 consequently , @xmath27 the equality takes place for squeezed states with the wave function @xmath28 thus , one has @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 read @xmath32 and @xmath33    for squeezed and correlated  @xcite states , the wave functions have the gaussian form , i.e. , @xmath34 and @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the correlation coefficient of the position and momentum , i.e. , @xmath37 and for squeezed but not correlated states @xmath38 .",
