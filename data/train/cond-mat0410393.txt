    "for example , let us consider the 1d quantization of the 2d rashba hamiltonian @xcite,@xcite @xmath5),\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the 2d electron momentum , and @xmath7 is the normal to the plane of the system ( axis @xmath8 ) .",
    "the size quantization in @xmath9 direction leads to the reduction of the hamiltonian ( [ rh ] ) for the lowest subband : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the 1d momentum . in this case",
    "the vector @xmath12 .",
    "the similar hamiltonian arises in cubic crystals with no inversion symmetry from the spin - orbit term in the bulk hamiltonian of dresselhaus @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is 3d electron momentum .",
    "the symmetric in all indexes tensor @xmath15 characterizes the anisotropy of the crystal . in the principal crystal axes @xmath15 has the only non - zero component @xmath16 , in the general case @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the rotation matrix from the frame of reference of crystallographic axes to the laboratory system .",
    "the confinement along two directions , say @xmath9 and @xmath8 , converts @xmath19 into the 1d hamiltonian , linear in the momentum @xmath20 .",
    "the form of this hamiltonian depends on the orientation of the wire relative to the principal crystal axes .    as the result of quantization",
    "we obtain @xmath21 where the overline means the averaging with the wave function of the ground state in quantum well .    in the considered cases the vector @xmath22 is constant .",
    "more general is the situation of curved wire , in which the vector @xmath23 becomes variable in accordance with the change of local direction of the axis @xmath4 .",
    "the adiabatic hamiltonian takes form of ( [ 1])-([1 ] ) , where @xmath4 is the coordinate along the wire , @xmath20 is the conjugate momentum ; the symmetrization reestablishes the hermicity .",
    "the other factors of appearance of so interaction in the form ( [ 1 ] ) are curvature - induced and torsion - induced so interactions @xcite .",
    "in the particular case of a curved wire with axially symmetrical cross - section we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the binormal to the wire , @xmath26 is the curvature , @xmath27 is the effective so coupling constant of bulk crystal @xcite , @xmath28 is the matrix element on the transversal wave function of the lowest subband of the wire .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 has order of the energy of quantization in the wire .",
    "the so hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) is the most general local expression which has the first order in the so constant and linear in @xmath20 .",
    "the other form of the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) is @xmath30 where the velocity operator is @xmath31 .",
    "we shall demonstrate , that the hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) can be unitary transformed to the form with no pauli matrices .",
    "let us consider an equation @xmath32 for an operator @xmath33 which explicitly depends on the coordinate @xmath4 .",
    "the solution of ( [ 2 ] ) is @xmath34 the expression ( [ 3 ] ) can be rewritten as x - ordered exponent ( similar to t - ordering with difference that the ordering should be done in @xmath4-space ) : @xmath35 the operation @xmath36 means that all operators should be placed in the decreasing order of @xmath37 .",
    "the inverse operator @xmath38 is determined by the ordering in the inverse order @xmath39 : @xmath40 the operator @xmath33 is unitary : @xmath41 ; one can treat @xmath33 as a spacial evolution operator",
    ". it can be expanded on the @xmath42 matrix basis : @xmath43 , where the real vector @xmath44 satisfies an equation @xmath45=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by means of the operator @xmath46 the wave function transforms as @xmath47 .",
    "the identities @xmath48 and @xmath49 are valid , that yields the transformation rules @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the transformed spin operator @xmath52 obeys the equation @xmath53 $ ] and has the explicit form @xmath54 .",
    "using these rules we find @xmath55 thus , the transformation excludes the spin from the schrdinger equation .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 12 ] ) immediately yields the spin degeneracy of electron states , unless the boundary conditions depend on spin explicitly .",
    "in particular , if the simple - connected wire is infinite in both direction and the states are localized , the boundary conditions @xmath56 yield @xmath57 .",
    "this means double spin degeneracy ( kramers degeneracy ) .",
    "the delocalized states remain double - degenerate also .",
    "the unitary transformation of the hamiltonian to the form ( [ 12 ] ) has strong impact on different response functions .",
    "for example , consider linear responses of electric current @xmath58 , spin polarization @xmath59 and spin current @xmath60 . the electric field ( tangent component )",
    "is assumed to be constant along the wire .",
    "these linear responses are expressed by the kubo formula via the velocity or velocity - spin correlators @xmath61 where in the case of conductivity @xmath62 stands for the velocity operator @xmath63 , for the spin orientation and spin current @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , @xmath66 is the fermi function , @xmath67 is the length of the system .",
    "more general expressions for responses in arbitrary order on the electric field are determined by the velocity correlators @xmath68 or spin - velocity correlators @xmath69 instead of the spin operator one can write the spin current operator @xmath70 .",
    "let us unitary transform operators inside the trace operation using transformation @xmath71 .",
    "after the transformation the expression under @xmath72 in ( [ 109 ] ) becomes unit in the spin space . the expression ( [ 109 ] ) reduces to @xmath73 and ( [ 110 ] ) goes to @xmath74 as a result of ( [ 109 ] ) , the conductivity of the system with so interaction converts to that of the system with no so interaction .",
    "the eq.([110 ] ) follows from the identity @xmath75 , where @xmath76 denotes the trace in the spin space .",
    "it proves that both coefficients of spin polarization @xmath77 and spin current @xmath78 vanish .",
    "similar conclusions can be done with respect to electrical responses of higher orders ( _ e.g. _ , the photogalvanic effect ) which are not subjected to so interaction and spin responses on the electric field ( e.g. , stationary spin orientation by alternating electric field ) which vanish .    note , that for proof of ( [ 110 ] ) it is essential the presence of _ the only _ spin operator under the trace ; the similar correlators , containing two or more spin operators do not vanish .",
    "note also , that the proof can be reformulated in the terms of the wave function .",
    "in fact , the wave function can be decomposed to the product of spinor function @xmath79 , obeying the equation @xmath80 and scalar function @xmath81 obeying the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the separation of variables can be done for the green functions : they decay on a product of the coordinate green function @xmath82 of the hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) and spin functions @xmath83 .",
    "in this section we consider possible generalizations of the hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) which conserve the main conclusions .",
    "first , we can include the electric field into the potential @xmath84 , hence all conclusions remain valid in presence of it in any order of magnitude .",
    "second , we can consider the potential as periodic ( or containing periodic part together with random one ) .",
    "such potential without the so interaction forms the energy bands @xmath85 , where @xmath20 is now quasimomentum .",
    "the operator @xmath86 in so part goes to @xmath87 .",
    "hence the resulting new hamiltonian can be also converted to the form with no spin operators .",
    "third , the spin can be treated as a quantum number , counting any pair - degenerate levels .",
    "for example , they can be subbands , originated from two equivalent valleys of bulk semiconductor .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) in that case refers to the system with valley degeneracy without spin . according to the found transform",
    ", the valley degeneracy will not be lifted .",
    "fourth , we can include spin - independent e - e interaction .",
    "as such hamiltonian does not touch the spin , the transformation can be done also .",
    "from said above one can conclude that there is no spin - orbit interaction in 1d system .",
    "in fact , this is not the case .",
    "the spin does not commute with the hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "hence , an electron with a preset spin , once injected into the wire , will change the spin during propagation along the wire .",
    "in particular , this manifests itself in the systems with magnetic spin injectors / spin - selective drains @xcite , where the boundary conditions break the form of the hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "( in the magnetic injector one should supplement the hamiltonian with the exchange term like @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the mean spin density in the contact , @xmath90 is the exchange constant ) .",
    "conductance of a finite wire with spin - selective source and drain should be sensitive to the spin evolution caused by the so interaction .",
    "thus , the total system does not obey the conditions of the proof .",
    "the same is valid for cyclic systems , _",
    "e.g. _ a ring .",
    "the periodic boundary condition in the ring of length @xmath67 , @xmath91 converts into the equation @xmath92 , containing the spin via the operator @xmath46 .",
    "hence , the spin operator , being eliminated from the schrdinger equation , appears in the boundary conditions that produces the spin splitting of levels .",
    "we have neglected the zeeman term in the hamiltonian , direct interaction of spin with the magnetic field .",
    "this term actually leads to the spin - flip transitions caused by the alternating magnetic field and other effects . due to relativistic smallness",
    "they are weak .",
    "an example of such effect is examined below .",
    "we consider here a spiral quantum wire with circular cross - section .",
    "epsf = 8 cm    in this system the alternating electromagnetic field can cause the steady electric current @xcite .",
    "we have previously studied the system neglecting the so interaction . with taking into account so interaction",
    "the possibility of resonant current caused by spin - flip processes arises . in accordance with",
    "said above , the _ electric _ component of field can not induce such current .",
    "hence the direct interaction of spin with magnetic field ( epr - resonance ) should be taken into account .",
    "the equation of central line of helical wire is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the radius of the helix , @xmath95 is the coordinate ( length ) along the helix , the pitch of the helix is @xmath96 .",
    "the sign of @xmath97 determines the helix direction @xmath98 .",
    "the spiral symmetry of the wire with respect to translations along the wire ( @xmath99 ) helps to find exact electron states .",
    "the adiabatic 1d hamiltonian reads @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 ,   @xmath102 is the tangent ort to the wire , @xmath103 is the binormal , @xmath104 is the vector - potential of electromagnetic wave polarized in @xmath105 plane ; the last ( zeemann ) term describes interaction of spin with alternating magnetic field @xmath106 without the zeemann term the spin can be excluded , as mentioned above and the problem is reduced to the spinless one @xcite . the zeemann term results in the photogalvanic effect caused by transitions between spin - splitted subbands .    let us consider the magnetic field polarized in the plane @xmath107 .",
    "the wire symmetry imposes the current phenomenology of the form @xmath108_z $ ] .",
    "the contribution to the stationary current due to interaction of electron spin with magnetic field is given by the quadratic kubo - type formula :    @xmath109\\bigg\\ } ,         \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath110 is the velocity - spin - spin correlator , @xmath111 is the hamiltonian ( 20 ) in the absence of external field ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "we shall neglect complications caused by the localization of electron states in 1d system and emulate the impurity scattering by the switching - on field : the rate of the field @xmath113 replaces the reciprocal relaxation time @xmath114 .",
    "the resulting current is@xmath115_z      \\left [      f(\\frac{2m\\omega - c^2}{2c})-f(\\frac{2m\\omega+c^2}{2c})\\right],\\ ] ] where@xmath116 the current exists in a narrow window of frequencies corresponding to the permitted spin - flip transitions .",
    "when so interaction is switched off the width of window ( but not the current magnitude ) shrinks .",
    "thus , the direct interaction of the spin with the magnetic field of the wave results in the spin - guided translational effect .",
    "the epr - induced photogalvanic effect should be compared with the photogalvanic effect caused by the action of electrical field on the translational motion of electron @xcite ; the latter exists in the absence of so interaction . for a running electromagnetic wave",
    "both effects add together , for a standing wave ( e.g. , in resonator ) they can be observed separately if to place the wire in loop or node of corresponding fields . besides , they have different frequency dependencies .    in conclusion",
    ", we have found that in 1d systems different response function , which does not include the spin degree of freedom are not influenced by spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the responses connecting the spin and translational degrees of freedom are nonexistent unless the direct magnetic - field spin - flip processes are taken into account . on the contrary , the inclusion of such interaction leads to the magnetic - field - induced resonant steady current .",
    "in contrast to 2d systems , where so interaction plays determinative role for phenomena involving charge transfer and spin , in 1d systems the influence of so interaction is suppressed . the transition from 2d to 1d due to lateral quantization results in the sequential decrease of so - induced effects .",
