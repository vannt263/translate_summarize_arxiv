    "a potential death trap for such relativistic outflows is the amount of entrained baryonic mass from the surrounding environment ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in neutron star binaries the elevated post - merger neutrino fluxes are capable of ablating matter from the surface of the remnant at a rate @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus the rest mass flux arising from the neutrino - driven wind bounds the bulk lorentz factor of the jet to @xmath2 and hence the successful launch of a highly relativistic jet might have to wait until the collapse of the merger remnant and the ensuing formation of the black hole plus debris disk system .",

    "when @xmath7 , various mechanisms could act to dissipate and/or transport energy and angular momentum , possibly inducing collapse after a delay which could range from tens of milliseconds to a few seconds ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "during this period , a baryon loaded wind is continuously ejected for a time @xmath8 , which precedes jet formation @xcite . as a result",
    ", a dense wind remains to hamper the advance of the jet , whose injection lifetime , @xmath9 , is determined by the viscous time scale of the neutrino - cooled disk @xcite .    in this _",
    ", we study with the use of hydrodynamical simulations how the expansion of the relativistic jet is modified by the previously ejected wind and investigate the conditions necessary for successful sgrb production in binary neutron star mergers .",

    "section  [ num ] describes the results of the numerical calculations .",
    "finally , section  [ dis ] gives a compendium of the types of observational signatures expected for jets propagating through neutrino - driven winds of different mass loading and durations together with a model proposal for generating sgrbs with precursor and extended emission .",
    "the properties of the neutrino - driven wind have an important effect on a jet propagating through it .",
    "if the isotropic equivalent power in the jet , @xmath10 , is roughly conserved and stationary , then we balance momentum fluxes at the working surface to obtain @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the head and shock velocities respectively , and both the shocked jet material and the shocked wind material advance with a jet head lorentz factor @xmath14 @xcite . here @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the density of the wind material and @xmath17 the specific enthalpy of the jet .     versus @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the time when the wind injection terminates and the jet starts its expansion .",

    "thus , the breakout time for a steady jet propagating through a wind with a velocity @xmath27 , injected during a time @xmath8 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the wind injection time . as the jet makes its way out and its rate of advance is slowed down , most of the energy output during that period is deposited into a cocoon surrounding it @xcite .",

    "if collapse to a black hole is significantly delayed ( i.e. @xmath24 s ) , the majority of jets , with the exception of some very luminous ones , will not breakout during the typical duration of a sgrb ( @xmath25 ) .",

    "a sgrb will not be triggered . ]    here we carry out a set of axisymmetric , special relativistic hydrodynamics ( srhd ) simulations of the propagation of a jet produced in binary neutron star mergers and its interaction with the previously spouted neutrino - driven wind .",
    "the simulations employ the _ mezcal _ srhd adaptive mesh refinement code , a parallel , shock capturing code routinely used to simulate the propagation of relativistic jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "common to all simulations is the injection of a steady , spherically symmetric wind for a time period @xmath8 . immediately after @xmath8",
    ", the jet is injected and the wind power is assumed to decrease with time as @xmath54 . for simplicity , we consider the relativistic jet to be uniform with sharp edges and an initial half - opening angle @xmath55 . as a first example",
    ", we follow the dynamics of a standard sgrb jet expanding through a neutrino - driven wind that was steadily ejected over @xmath43 s before the merger remnant s collapse and the subsequent formation of the black hole .",
    "the properties of the neutrino - driven wind have been chosen to roughly match those envisioned by @xcite for a hot , differentially rotating merger remnant .",
    "detailed hydrodynamic simulations of the expansion of a relativistic jet in such a wind medium are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] , where the density profiles of the advancing jet at various times in its evolution are plotted . as the sgrb jet makes its way through the dense wind ,",

    "the excess energy must then not collect near the working surface but be accumulated within a cocoon engulfing the jet .",
    "the jet would be expected to escape from the wind region as long as @xmath56 ( equation  [ eq : tbl ] ) .",
    "[ fig : time ] depicts the two types of behavior expected for a steady sgrb jet expanding in a dense wind with @xmath57 . for @xmath56 ,",
    "the jet comes out from the edge of the wind at @xmath58 into an exponentially decreasing atmosphere and into the rarefied ism beyond it .",
    "the jet will then attain a bulk lorentz factor @xmath48 soon after its emergence and could lead to a successful sgrb . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the jet starts to drastically decelerate before it reaches the edge of the wind and is unable to break free .",
    "an accompanying sgrb will not be present in this case .",
    "some conditions increase the likelihood of a successful break - through of the jet . at a fixed jet luminosity",
    ", the risk of stalling is lower when the lifetime of the post - merger remnant is short or when mass ablation is less efficient .",
    "the risk of choking can be also mitigated to a lesser extent by increasing the jet power .",
    "a similar calculation to that depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] can be generated for jets with varying luminosities but similar durations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lum ] ) . for a relatively low luminosity ,",
    "the rate of advance of the jet is slowed down drastically and , as a result , the jet is unable to break free ( i.e. @xmath59 ) . only when the luminosity is greatly increased would the jet be able to successfully emerge from the wind and subsequently give rise to a sgrb .",
    "note that this is akin to the situation present in long grbs from collapsars , where the relativistic outflow has to drill through the stellar envelope , with possible observational signatures related to the distribution of angular momentum within the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is evident from the above discussion that the environment of a binary neutron star merger at the time of black hole formation is complex and that the properties of the neutrino - driven wind have a decisive effect on jet propagation .",
    "the triggering of a sgrb will depends sensitively on the jet power and the time over which the jet is injected .",
    "[ fig : stdiag ] shows the schematic world - lines of jets with varying properties propagating through the same wind environment .",
    "the importance of the longevity of the jet ( relative to @xmath8 ) and the significance of the jet power are clearly illustrated .",
    "the rate of neutrino - driven mass loss ( equation [ eq : wind ] ) emanating from the merger remnant , as argued in sections  [ ana ] and [ num ] , has significant repercussions on the appearance of a relativistic jet propagating through it .",
    "but the requirements for successful break - through are most sensitive to the duration of the neutrino - driven wind phase ( @xmath8 ) , which in turn depends on the stability of the resulting hot , differentially rotating post - merger configuration .",
    "if collapse to a black hole and the ensuing jet production is significantly delayed ( i.e. @xmath60 s ) , the majority of jets will not be able to break free from the wind during the typical duration of a sgrb .",
    "on the contrary , if collapse occurs more promptly ( i.e. @xmath61 s ) , the successful break - through of the jet would take place swiftly enough to allow for the production of a typical sgrb .    the observed duration distribution of sgrbs can thus be used to constrain the longevity of the post - merger remnant , which is currently under debate . in systems where a stable remnant is formed ( the magnetar model",
    "; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , jet formation can not be notably delayed ( @xmath0 ms ) from the onset of the neutrino - driven wind .",
    "otherwise , a choked jet would result without exception .",
    "this is because in stable ( hyper - massive ) neutron stars , the neutrino - driven wind is expected to continue for at least a diffusion timescale , which is commensurate with the duration of the longest lasting sgrb .",
    "effective sgrb production under such circumstances would not only be afflicted by baryon contamination ( equation  [ eq : bpop ] ) and wind confinement ( equation  [ eq : lumreq ] ) but also by the time delay between the onset of neutrino - driven mass ablation and jet formation .",
    "whatever one s view of the relative merits of the magnetar and the black hole plus debris disk models in producing ultra - relativistic outflows , it is clear that the presence of a long lived , dense wind , a common feature in the magnetar model , severely hinders the successful production of a sgrb .",
    "the shocks responsible for producing the @xmath31-rays must surface after the jet has broken free from the neutrino - driven wind . for a large subset of compact merger progenitors , with the exception of black hole neutron star mergers , a hyper - massive remnant will be formed .",
    "a neutrino - driven wind will thus persist to obstruct the progress of the jet .",
    "the cocoon would be able to collimate the jet provided that @xmath62 @xcite . in the simplest case considered here of a wind",
    "whose properties do not vary over its lifetime , the jet s head velocity is constant and the cocoon is unable to compensate for the jet s expansion ( figures  [ fig : time ] and  [ fig : lum ] ) .",
    "collimation is seen to increase with decreasing @xmath63 for @xmath64 where @xmath65 . while writing this paper we became aware of a recent preprint @xcite , in which the interaction of a jet with the previously dynamically ejected material ( which is independent of the neutrino - driven wind we consider here ) in a binary merger @xcite is used to argue as an effective mechanism for the collimation of a sgrb jet .",
    "the energy supplied by the jet exceeds that imparted to the swept - up wind material by a factor @xmath66 .",
    "the excess energy must then not gather near the working surface but be deposited within a cocoon surrounding the jet ( figures  [ fig : time ] and [ fig : lum ] ) . unless there is violent mixing of baryons from the wind , the build - up of energy to baryon - rest - mass in the cocoon",
    "will be given approximately by @xmath67 .",
    "as soon as the jet reaches the edge of the wind , @xmath68 , the cocoon material would itself be able to break - out and expand through the wind along the direction of least resistance , which is likely to be along the jet s axis .",
    "beyond @xmath68 , the external pressure drops steeply , and the cocoon material will expand freely with @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "if its unhampered transverse expansion starts just outside @xmath68 , where the lorentz factor of the cocoon material is only a few , then it will spread over a wide angle .    in the case of a successful break - through of the relativistic jet",
    ", the outflowing cocoon could result in potentially interesting and observable phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the relativistic material that accumulated in the cocoon could have an energy comparable to that of the jet when @xmath70 .",
    "not only would a typical sgrb be detectable , followed by a standard afterglow , but also there could be additional emission before and after the main event when the cocoon material becomes transparent and when it decelerates . while the main afterglow radiation will be produced by the slowing down of the jet as in the usual case , prompt x - ray emission at early stages could be caused by the deceleration of the cocoon blast wave , which is expected to be less energetic .",
    "this could resemble the so called _ extended emission _ in sgrbs @xcite , in particular if it is slowly varying .",
    "there could also be precursor signatures @xcite which are not associated with internal dissipation in the jet , but with the dynamics of the cocoon fireball .",
    "the @xmath31-ray signal emerging from the cocoon fireball as it becomes transparent will most likely appear as a transient signal before the beginning of the main burst @xcite , where the observed variability time scale would be related to the typical size of the shocked plasma region containing the photon field : @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "the detection of these prompt signatures would be a test of the neutron star binary merger model and the precise measurement of the time delay between emissions may help constrain the duration and properties of the neutrino driven wind phase .",
    "if we were to venture a general classification scheme for grbs , on the hypothesis that the central engine involves a black hole formed in double neutron star mergers , we would obviously expect the disk and black hole mass @xcite , the angular momentum of the black hole and the orientation relative to our line of sight to be essential parameters .",
    "it is then necessary , within such a model , to identify sgrbs with merging systems for which black hole formation occurs promptly ( @xmath0 ms ) as any moderate delay at the hyper - massive neutron star stage would result in a choked jet .",
