    ", attempts to detect the atmosphere of hd209458b from the ground have so far been unsuccessful .",
    "so far , only upper limits of typically 1 - 2% have been reached , for the sodium d feature in the optical ( brown et al .",
    "2000 ; bundy & marcy 2000 ; moutou et al .",

    "ground - based observations suffer greatly from the fact that transmission spectroscopy relies on the comparison of spectra on and off transit , which are necessarily taken on different nights .",
    "this limits the accuracy due to varying weather conditions and instability of the instruments . in this paper a new method for probing the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets is presented , making use of the rossiter effect . due to the rotation of the host star ,",
    "a transiting planet will first block off light from the approaching and then from the receding parts of the stellar surface .",
    "this results in an artificial wobble in radial velocity , an effect first observed by rossiter ( 1924 ) for the eclipsing binary @xmath7 lyrae .",
    "the amplitude of this signal is directly proportional to the effective size of the transiting planet , and the wavelength dependence of this effect can reveal atmospheric absorption features , in the same way as with transmission spectroscopy .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it does not rely on accurate photometric comparison of spectra in and out of transit , but instead depends on relative velocity shifts of stellar absorption lines in the same in - transit spectra .",
    "we applied this new method to an archival data set of hd209458 taken with the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) on the very large telescope .",
    "this data was originally obtained to perform conventional atmospheric transmission spectroscopy ( pi : moutou et al . ,",
    "project 69.c-0263 ) .",
    "data was collected during 7 nights ( 4 on , and 3 off transit ) through uves red arm only , using the cd3 cross disperser with a blaze wavelength of 5600 @xmath8 , and image slicer nr .",
    "3 , consisting of 5 slices of 0.3  width each . each night",
    "a series of 15 data frames were taken with exposure times of 400 sec .",
    "a calibrator was observed after the 5th and 10th frame each time , leaving gaps of @xmath925 min .",
    "the observation log is given in table [ log ] .",
    "the detector in the red arm of uves consists of a mosaic of two 4k@xmath102k ccds . for our analysis",
    "we concentrated on one ccd , covering a wavelength range of 5850 to 6550 @xmath8 over 16 echelle orders , and which contains the two sodium d lines ( 5890.0 & 5895.9  ) in its first order .",
    "the data reduction was performed in a standard manner , using eso s uves data reduction pipeline , which is part of the software package midas .",
    "data from each echelle order was kept separately , with the output data of each frame consisting of a 2 dimensional array with wavelength position along the x - axis ( pixel size = 0.0174  ) , and echelle order along the y - axis .",
    "the resolving power was typically @xmath9110,000 . the orbital phase of hd209458b was determined for each observation using the orbital parameters as derived by brown et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and were corrected for variations in light traveling time through the solar system . a global phase - shift of 0.008 ( 40 min .",
    ") had to be applied to all data sets to centre the rossiter effect at zero phase .",
    "this shift corresponds to an error in the period derived by brown et al .",
    "of 8 sec .",
    "the subsequent data analysis on the 2 dimensional data frames was performed in idl .",
    "first the spectrum in each order was fitted with a 7th order chebyshev function away from absorption features , and normalised . further analysis consisted of the four steps described below .",
    "since some of their input and/or output are interdependent they are performed several times before the final results were produced .",

    "first a model of the stellar absorption spectrum of hd209458 was produced from the velocity shifted and median filtered spectra obtained during the 7 nights .",
    "this model was then appropriately shifted and subtracted from each frame , leaving only the telluric line absorption .",
    "the dozen strongest lines were fitted with gaussians and their positions compared with the spectral atlas of telluric line absorption of pierce & breckenridge ( 1974 ) .",
    "after several iterations , necessary to obtain the best stellar model , the absolute wavelength calibration is found to be accurate to @xmath95 - 10 m / sec .    [ [ step-2-fitting - of - the - stellar - absorption - lines . ] ] step 2 : fitting of the stellar absorption lines .",

    "the accuracy of this method was estimated by measuring the standard deviation around the mean position of the line during each night , corrected for earth rotation and orbital motion and changes in the wavelength solution .",
    "the two sodium d lines were fitted in a similar way , but with a 4 parameter moffat function instead of a gaussian .",
    "[ [ step-3-relative - wavelength - calibration . ] ] step 3 : relative wavelength calibration .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it was found that the relative positions of the strong emission lines varied much more than expected , and that these variations were a function of the position of a line within its order ( a typical example is shown in figure [ flexure ] ) .",
    "a similar but generally smaller trend was also found as function of the echelle order .",
    "these effects are most likely caused by small changes in the instrument settings and/or temperature of the spectrograph from exposure to exposure .",
    "we simply corrected for these trends by fitting relative positions of the @xmath9100 strongest lines as function of their pixel position with a 3rd order chebyshev function , and with a 2nd order polynomial as function of the echelle order .",
    "the residual scatter around the best fits are found to be typically 10@xmath415 m / sec .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    great care has to be taken in the removal of telluric line absorption , especially around the sodium d line at 5889.9  .",
    "a small change in the strength of the telluric absorption can introduce a significant shift in radial velocity , if it is located within the fitting region of the stellar absorption line . using the best wavelength solution available , a model of the stellar spectrum of hd209458 , as obtained above ,",
    "is subtracted from the data , leaving only the telluric lines . using the line list of pierce & breckenridge ( 1974 ) ,",
    "the telluric absorption lines are fitted with gaussians , with the amplitude as only free parameter , and are subsequently removed .",
    "the accuracy in radial velocity achieved for one of the data sets is shown as function of the absorption line depth in figure [ accuracy ] .",
    "it shows that for the strongest lines , such as the sodium d lines , an accuracy of 5 - 10 m / sec has been reached .",
    "monte - carlo simulation were performed to determine the theoretical uncertainty as function of absorption line strength , assuming a signal to noise ratio of 500 per spectral element .",
    "this is indicated by the solid line .",
    "first the overall strength of the rossiter effect of hd209458 was determined .",
    "the weighted mean of the radial velocities of all absorption lines was determined for each exposure , and subsequently corrected for the star s motion induced by the exoplanet ( assuming an amplitude of 85.9 m / sec ; mazeh et al . 2000 ) , the motion and rotation of the earth , and for the shifts in the absolute wavelength calibration as determined above .",
    "the same corrections were applied to the radial velocities of the two sodium d lines .",
    "the 4 on - transit data sets were then merged by applying small global @xmath11 m / sec offsets to the data to minimise the scatter in the combined velocity curve .",
    "the merged velocity curves are shown in figure [ amplitude ] , which are fitted to models of the rossiter effect .",
    "our models are constructed in a similar way as in queloz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , by simulating the transit of a dark object over a limb - darkened star .",
    "a spherical star with uniform rotation is considered , with the orbital motion of the planet and the stellar rotation set in the same direction .",
    "the angle between the orbital plane and the equatorial plane is assumed to be zero , and the impact parameter is set to 0.5 , corresponding to the orbital inclination of 86.6@xmath12 as determined by brown et al .",
    "the star is divided into 200,000 cells , with the spectrum of each cell modeled by a gaussian absorption line with @xmath13 km / sec .",
    "the overall integrated spectrum is made by summation of the cells free of the planet along the line of sight .",
    "the aim of this modeling is to set the amplitude scale of the rossiter effect relative to the depth of the photometric transit .",
    "limb darkening is assumed to be of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the local stellar surface , and @xmath16 is assumed to be 0.58 ( deeg et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the influence of wavelength dependent limb - darkening is discussed below . assuming a ratio of planet to star radius of 0.118 ( brown et al .",
    "2001 ) , the overall velocity curve is best fitted with a stellar @xmath17 of 4.5 km / sec , resulting in an amplitude of the rossiter effect of about 38 m / sec ( see figure [ amplitude ] ) .",
    "this amplitude corresponds to the photometric transit depth of 1.6% ( brown et al .",
    "2001 ) , meaning that an excess of 1 m / sec compares to a signal for conventional atmospheric transmission spectroscopy of 0.04% .",
    "the mean radial velocity of each exposure were then subtracted from that of the sodium d lines to reveal any possible excess in the rossiter effect .",
    "the global velocity shifts applied above cancel out , but new global velocity shifts were applied to each data set , to set the mean relative velocity shift of all 15 exposures to zero .",
    "ideally , the observations should have cover a substantial period before and after the transit to set the zero - point independently from the in - transit data ( see below ) .",
    "the velocity shifts of the sodium d lines compared to the average of all other lines is shown in figure [ relative ] .",
    "the scatter in the four data sets is 6.5 , 3.7 , 7.6 , and 4.7 m / sec respectively .",
    "the right panel shows the data binned together , using time - bins of 450 seconds .",
    "the dispersion around zero in this binned data set is 4.7 m / sec .",
    "the data set is fitted with the model described above , with all parameters fixed except the amplitude of the signal .",
    "the best fit gives an amplitude of @xmath0 m / sec , corresponding to a photometric signal using conventional atmospheric transmission spectroscopy of 7@xmath15@xmath18 .",
    "the analysis of the uves archive data shows that the rossiter effect provides a powerful tool to probe the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets .",
    "although no significant signal has been detected for sodium d in hd209458b , it is the first time that ground - based observations result in an accuracy of @xmath190.001 .",
    "previous ground - based observations have reached accuracies of only 1@xmath42% , corresponding to an excess in the rossiter effect of 20@xmath450 m / sec , clearly inferior to the precision achieved here .",
    "the hst transmission spectrum of hd209458b obtained by charbonneau et al .",
    "( 2002 ) revealed an excess in absorption in sodium d of 0.00023 compared to the surrounding continuum , implying a relative increase of @xmath91.8% .",
    "this indicates that for this particular absorption feature an excess in the rossiter effect of @xmath90.7 m / sec can be expected , making its detection very challenging for the current instrumentation .",
    "however , it is important to realise that the excess in absorption as determined with the hst was measured over a bandwidth of 12 .",
    "in contrast , line - to - line variations in the rossiter effect will be most sensitive to planetary absorption on scales of the half - power width of the stellar lines ( a fraction of an ngstrom ) . most models of transmission spectra ( eg .",
    "brown 2001 ) indicate that on this scale the absorption signal for sodium d could be 2@xmath45 times higher ( 1@xmath43 m / sec ) .",
    "the archival data sets used in this paper are not optimal for measuring the rossiter effect .",
    "first of all , since a significant fraction of the time was devoted to calibrators , typically only 60% of the on - transit time was spent on target , and on several occasions the periods that the amplitude of the rossiter effect is expected to be the strongest were missed .",
    "in addition , the current analysis is significantly hampered by the fact that no or hardly any time was spent on target directly before or after each transit .",
    "this was often dictated by the timing of the transit and visibility of hd209458 from paranal .",
    "for the most optimal transits , hd209458 can be observed from 1 hour before to 1 hour after the overall transit with the vlt . in those cases the zero - point in velocity can be determined independently from the on - transit data , and one could also correct for any possible residual drifts in radial velocity over the transit , eg . due to residual telluric absorption line features or inaccuracies in flat fielding .",
    "overall , this should result in an increase in precision of a factor @xmath20 .",
    "it means that , if the current value is believed , a 3@xmath45 @xmath2 detection of sodium d should be possible over a couple of transits .",
    "the exact shape and amplitude of the rossiter effect are dependent on the stellar limb darkening .",
    "so far we have not taken into account that limb darkening decreases as function of wavelength .",
    "furthermore , the limb darkening effect also changes differently over the profile of each absorption line .",
    "here we assess the possible influence of both effects .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the limb darkening of hd209458 has been observed by deeg et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , with @xmath16 changing from 0.62 at 5900 @xmath8 to 0.58 at 6180  . to estimate the influence of this effect we assumed a linear wavelength dependence of @xmath21 , and calculated the change in radial velocity for each line relative to that of sodium using the model described above . by incorporating this wavelength dependent limb - darkening",
    ", the excess of the rossiter effect in the sodium d lines is increased by @xmath90.2 m / sec .",
    "the variations in limb darkening across solar absorption lines is studied in great detail by pierce & slaughter ( 1982 ) for sodium d , and by balthasar ( 1988 ) for a whole range of bright absorption lines , by measuring changes in the absorption line depths across the solar disk .",
    "the strength of this effect is dependent on the mechanism of formation of the line .",
    "most absorption lines weaken towards the limb of the sun , meaning that the limb darkening in the centre of the lines is less than in the surrounding continuum . assuming that this effect is similar for hd209458 as for the sun",
    ", our modeling indicates that these variation contribute at a level of again @xmath90.2 cm / sec .",
    "although this is insignificant for these data , it means that future observation aimed at measuring variations in the rossiter effect at much higher precision should take these effects into account .",
    "we believe that the new method presented here to probe atmospheres of transiting exoplanets using the rossiter effect , has great potential .",
    "specifically targeted observations , rather than the archival data used here , can increase the accuracy further by a factor 2@xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , in the near - infrared , where the atmospheric absorption features due to h@xmath5o , co , and ch@xmath6 cover many stellar lines , a great improvement over current observations can be reached .",
    "although confusion with water - vapor and methane in the earth atmosphere will complicate the analysis .",
    "in addition , anticipating the discovery of exoplanets transiting bright stars of either later spectral type ( with many more stellar lines to average ) , or with faster stellar rotations ( resulting in a rossiter effect with a higher amplitude ) , a further significant increase in accuracy can be expected .",
    "i would like to thank philip best for useful discussions and for carefully reading the manuscript .",
    "this research is based on observations made with the european southern observatory telescopes obtained from the eso / st - ecf science archive facility .",
