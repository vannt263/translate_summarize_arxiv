    "<S> a novel method allowing to compute density , velocity and other fields in cosmological n  body simulations with unprecedentedly high spatial resolution is described . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the tessellation of the three - dimensional manifold representing cold dark matter in six - dimensional phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the density , velocity and other fields are computed by projecting the tessellation on configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> the application of this technique to cosmological n  </S>",
    "<S> body simulations in @xmath0cdm cosmology reveals a far more elaborate cosmic web then dot plots or self  adaptive sph . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this method allows to uniquely define physical voids and identify and study the caustic surfaces directly .    </S>",
    "<S> cosmological n - body simulations currently represent the major tool for the theoretical studies of the formation and evolution of the cosmic web . </S>",
    "<S> they provide the most accurate statistical information on the distribution of mass and galaxies to be compared with observations . </S>",
    "<S> most of the simulations deal with the growth of the structure only in collisionless dark matter ( hereafter dm ) since it dominates the mass being able to cluster gravitationally . due to a huge number of dark matter particles </S>",
    "<S> the most accurate physical model of dm is collisionless fluid .    </S>",
    "<S> a new method@xcite ( see also @xcite ) considers the growth of cold dark matter web as the evolution of a three  dimensional manifold ( the phase  </S>",
    "<S> space sheet , hereafter pss ) in six  dimensional phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy of the pss is a result of extremely low thermal velocity dispersion in cold dm . </S>",
    "<S> the pss is approximated by a tessellation with the vertices represented by the particles of n - body simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the tessellation must be created at the linear stage before shell crossing occurs and must remain intact throughout the rest of the evolution . out of many choices </S>",
    "<S> the tetrahedral tessellation is the most sensible because tetrahedra practically always remain convex . </S>",
    "<S> the exceptions happen only at isolated instances of time when four vertices become coplanar and the tetrahedron degenerates into a flat polygon . </S>",
    "<S> computing the volume of the tetrahedron at later times using the initial order of vertices results in a negative value . </S>",
    "<S> if the tetrahedron passes through the coplanar state one more time its volume become positive again . </S>",
    "<S> these metamorphoses can repeat many times .    </S>",
    "<S> the vertices aka particles are treated as the flow tracers while the tetrahedra as the mass tracers . </S>",
    "<S> the density of each tetrahedron can be easily computed assuming that the mass of each tetrahedron is conserved and uniformly distributed within its volume . </S>",
    "<S> the tetrahedra tile the eulerian configuration space without overlapping in the linear regime before shell crossing occurs . at later times </S>",
    "<S> they start to overlap resulting in the origin of multi  stream flow regions . </S>",
    "<S> various fields ( density , velocity and others ) can be derived by projecting the pss on configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> this techniques uses the full phase  </S>",
    "<S> space information available in the simulations . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the derived fields can be computed with unprecedented spatial resolution . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , new fields such as multi - stream@xcite and parity@xcite fields can also be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> these fields provide new invaluable information about the dynamics of the cosmic web which is supplemental to the density and velocity fields routinely used in cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the whole volume with one  stream flow can be defined as the physical void i.e. the volume devoid of structures that the n  body simulation is capable to resolve .    </S>",
    "<S> the signs of the tetrahedra volumes make the parity field in lagrangian space@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this field has a nontrivial topological property : the three  dimensional map of parity can be painted by only two different colors . </S>",
    "<S> the interface between regions with different colors approximates the caustic surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the number of streams is an odd integer at every generic point of configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> the number of stream can be even only on caustic surfaces having measure zero . </S>",
    "<S> the number of streams can is easy to compute at an arbitrary point by counting the number of tetrahedra enclosing it . </S>",
    "<S> similarly the density and other fields can be estimated by summing up the corresponding quantities over all tetrahedra enclosing the chosen point .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the method using an example from n - body simulation of the @xmath0cdm cosmological model in a 512@xmath1mpc - sided cubic box@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the number of particles is 512@xmath2 and the grid size in the gravitational poisson solver is 1024@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the @xmath0cdm model are as follows : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , the initial redshift @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> we present a relatively small box cut from a much larger simulation box in order to reduce the obscuration effects . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 illustrates the change in the appearance of the structure with the growth of spatial resolution of the sampling grid employed for computing the fields . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth stressing that the number of particles and their coordinates are exactly same in all panels . </S>",
    "<S> the structures in density ( top panels ) and multi  stream ( bottom panels ) fields obviously have some common features however they are not identical ( see also@xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the left panels show the structure at the mass resolution of the n - body simulation . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that the multi  </S>",
    "<S> stream field clearly demonstrates pancakes at the lowest spatial resolution while the density field hardly suggests even a hint of the pancake presence . </S>",
    "<S> the explanation of the failure of detecting pancakes in n  </S>",
    "<S> body simulations was suggested long time ago@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pancakes contain a low fraction of mass and at the same time occupy a relatively large volume that results in a very low density contrast . </S>",
    "<S> this was quantitatively confirmed in the recent analysis of cosmological n  body simulations by applying a new elaborate technique called multiscale morphology filter@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mean density contrast of pancakes aka walls the @xmath0cdm cosmological model is about 1.1 while that of filaments and clusters is 4.5 and 73 respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the panels in the middle and on the right demonstrate the structure rendered with four and sixteen times higher resolution respectively . </S>",
    "<S> they clearly show all essential components of the cosmic web : clusters , filaments , pancakes , and voids .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing we stress the major points . </S>",
    "<S> the phase  space sheet contains significantly more dynamical information than coordinates and velocities of particles if particles are treated as independent items . </S>",
    "<S> the connectivity of the tessellation allows to recover underlying structure much more accurately and with much greater spatial resolution than dot plots or even self </S>",
    "<S>  adaptive sph@xcite . instead of using the particle discretization of the pss </S>",
    "<S> the suggested method is based on a piecewise - linear approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the new technique allows to reveal , visualize and quantify the complexity of the cosmic web at a much deeper and more profound level . </S>"
