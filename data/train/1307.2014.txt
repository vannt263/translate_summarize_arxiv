    "the presence of long range memory in complex systems has been studied in the literature in a wide variety of fields with a hope of better understanding the dynamics of these systems and to make their evolution more predictive . in the simplest case of stationary and monofractal time",
    "series the memory effects are defined with the use of two point autocorrelation function @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are data in series , @xmath9 is its length , @xmath10 is an average taken over all data in the given signal and @xmath11 are series increments .",
    "it is well known that @xmath12 reveals in this case the power law form in an asymptotic limit of large time lags @xmath13 @xcite    @xmath14    where the scaling exponent @xmath4 @xmath15 is related with the level of memory in signal and describes at boundaries fully autocorrelated ( persistent ) signal for @xmath16 or completely uncorrelated increments for @xmath17 .",
    "a direct calculation of correlation function and @xmath4 exponent gets more difficult in real signals when a noise or nonstationarities are present in data .",
    "therefore , to avoid this problem , an alternative approach is often made where the fluctuations in the cumulated data , i.e. fluctuations in the series @xmath18 @xmath19 , are considered .",
    "one measures the scaling hurst exponent @xmath20 @xcite of @xmath21 related to @xmath4 according to @xcite @xmath22 this way , any measurement of @xmath20 ( @xmath23 ) is mapped to the corresponding @xmath4 values .",
    "the most prominent example of such indirect analysis of memory effects is the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) @xcite .",
    "the scaling law from eq.(1 ) is replaced within dfa by the power law @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the averaged fluctuation of the signal around its local trend in time windows of fixed length @xmath26 .",
    "one has in detailed quantitative description : @xmath27 where @xmath28 here @xmath29 $ ] stands for the number of non - overlapping boxes for which the detrending procedure is performed and @xmath30 is the polynomial trend fitted to initial data in @xmath31-th time window and then subtracted from these data .",
    "an application of dfa is limited to systems whose memory properties are well described by a single scaling exponent .",
    "such an approach is insufficient in so called multifractal systems @xcite@xcite , where small and large fluctuations follow different scaling laws ( see , e.g. @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "one has to employ more general method of description in the latter case and a full understanding of issues connected with memory properties in multifractal data is still under debate .",
    "the multifractal properties of time series are now extensively studied because of the omnipresence of multifractals in various phenomena in nature .",
    "its presence is confirmed in empirical data from turbulence @xcite , astronomy @xcite , climate phenomena @xcite , physiology @xcite , text structure @xcite , physics @xcite up to finances @xcite@xcite , not covering many other publications on these phenomena .",
    "it is worth to stress that the answer to questions regarding accuracy , applicability and reliability of multifractal measurements is crucial for the development of efficient simulation or forecasting methods @xcite .",
    "one of the most frequently used techniques to quantify the multifractal properties in data series is multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis ( mf - dfa ) @xcite .",
    "the mf - dfa method enables to eliminate polynomial trends in data what makes it superior to other multifractal oriented techniques like the structure function analysis @xcite or the higher - order autocorrelation functions @xcite .",
    "the popular method to study multifractal properties is also the wavelet transform modulus maxima ( wtmm ) approach @xcite .",
    "wtmm eliminates polynomial trends similarly to mf - dfa but is considerably more difficult to implement .",
    "moreover , it may give biased outcomes and yields spurious multifractality more often @xcite .",
    "the mf - dfa has been applied so far in diversified scientific problems , just to mention : seismology @xcite , cosmology @xcite , biology @xcite , meteorology @xcite , medicine @xcite , music @xcite , geophysics @xcite , and finances @xcite@xcite far from being exhaustive here .",
    "let us remind that the main ingredient of mf - dfa is the @xmath32-weighted fluctuation @xmath33 of the time series signal around its local trend in a time window of size @xmath26 .",
    "more precisely , it is defined as an @xmath32-th moment ( @xmath34 ) of @xmath25 already used in dfa , i.e. @xmath35^{q/2}\\right\\}^{1/q}\\ ] ] for @xmath36 , and @xmath37\\right\\}\\ ] ] for @xmath38 .    the power law relation @xmath39 is expected in mf - dfa which forms a basis for the so called generalized hurst exponent @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "eq.(8 ) coincides with eq.(3 ) for @xmath41 , hence @xmath42 returns the main hurst exponent value .",
    "the multifractal properties may alternatively be presented as the multifractal spectrum @xmath43 @xcite , known also as hlder description .",
    "both descriptions are linked together via relations @xcite @xmath44    one usually calculates the strength of multifractality by the spread of @xmath40 profile , i.e. @xmath45 , ( @xmath46 ) or by the width of multifractal spectrum @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48 . both quantities coincide in the limit @xmath49 . in the case of stationary signal",
    "the @xmath40 profile has a monotonic behavior @xcite and the spectrum @xmath47 has a form of inverted parabola .",
    "its spread corresponds to the @xmath1 value . through this article two above descriptions",
    "will be used .",
    "it is worth to stress that multifractality is an interesting and perspective phenomenon for further investigation and applications . on the other hand ,",
    "it is very subtle and generally difficult task to distinguish in many real situations between true multifractal properties of a system and the apparent multifractal phenomena resulting directly from the records based on mf - dfa .",
    "recently , some new features connected with the so called spurious and corrupted multifractality were shown @xcite@xcite .",
    "it turns out that the presence of additive white or color noise , short - term memory or periodicities in multifractal signals may significantly change its observed multifractal properties for all data lengths .",
    "such contamination by additions of disturbances are typically found in many observational records in various complex systems : in physics , finance , physiology , geology , climate dynamics , network traffic , etc .",
    "all real series contain also finite sets of data .",
    "due to smaller statistics in short signals , the accidental fluctuations which are not related with multifractal properties contribute also to fluctuation function @xmath50 and may even dominate over fluctuations related with multifractality . on the other hand , the influence of large fluctuations in short time series can be suppressed since mf - dfa algorithm may not distinguish them from longer trends which are eliminated . in both cases",
    "the observed @xmath0 spread is increased comparing with the corresponding value obtained for much longer signals .",
    "this raises a question about confidence for multifractal findings which are naturally affected by finite size effects in autocorrelated or uncorrelated data even if they are not contaminated by the additional effects mentioned before .",
    "the nonlinear transformations of primary data also significantly affect the registered multifractal properties usually magnifying them .",
    "therefore , a link between true multifractal picture of the complex system and the observed quantitative properties which may suggest the presence of multifractality , even if it is absent in the system , is still an intriguing and not fully understood issue . it will obviously depend on the technique used to quantify multifractal phenomena . in this paper",
    "we use mf - dfa as the commonly accepted technique to find multifractal properties of time series .",
    "our goal is a deeper investigation of finite size effects ( fses ) influencing within mf - dfa method the observed multifractal features of time series .",
    "the finite size effects in multifractality were mentioned already in ref . @xcite . since then several authors approached this problem ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , however general search of this phenomenon has not been yet investigated .",
    "the particular emphasis will be given to amplification of an apparent observed multifractal effects caused by the presence of long memory in signals and by basic transformations done on initial monofractal data .",
    "these effects should be distinguished from the spurious or corrupted multifractality @xcite , where the given data series contaminated by various effects like noise , short - term memory , periodicities in signal , etc . , change the shape of multifractal profile @xmath40 or @xmath47 spectrum .",
    "the latter effects will affect multifractality for all lengths of data @xmath9 , while fse should disappear if @xmath51 .",
    "note , that one always deals in practice with finite set of data , so one should exactly know the level of confidence for results obtained within mf - dfa if they indicate a multifractality in the system , i.e. @xmath3 or @xmath52",
    ". the preliminary quantitative analysis of this problem had already been made in our conference paper @xcite .",
    "multifractal finite time series will contain the multifractal fse bias ( i.e. , the threshold spread of generalized hurst exponent values not related with multifractal properties of these series ) at least like a lot less complicated monofractal series of similar length and persistency level .",
    "we will deal with simpler , involving fewer parameters and more clear for synthetic generation monofractal data that will serve as a tool to find the minimal multifractal fse bias threshold in all kind of signal .",
    "we start with description of fse in monofractal series with the analysis of generalized hurst exponent @xmath40 . then this description is extended to an alternative approach of multifractal spectra in terms of @xmath1 in section 3 .",
    "both sections provide detailed analysis of threshold values @xmath0 and @xmath1 below which the multifractal properties of complex system are only apparent .",
    "the corresponding fse multifractal phenomena for linearly transformed data are discussed in section 4 .",
    "an interesting and important from practical point of view phenomenon of multifractal bias generated solely by nonlinear transformations in monofractal data is described in section 5 .",
    "one has to know the strength of of such bias to get the evidence of multifractal properties in primary not transformed data ( and in complex system in general ) if only volatile series of data from such systems are available .",
    "section 6 .",
    "summarizes semi - analytical results obtained in this article and contains final remarks and conclusions .",
    "we start to describe quantitatively , in terms of generalized hurst exponents @xcite , the expected level of multifractal background existing due to the finite - size effects for uncorrelated data as well as for time series with long memory induced by the explicit form of autocorrelations . our approach is based on the fourier filtering method ( ffm ) @xcite that directly shapes the memory level in artificial data by the respective choice of autocorrelation exponent @xmath4 ( see eq.(1 ) ) . in order to check the accuracy of ffm for generation of time series with a given persistency level , we examined this procedure towards replication of the pre - assumed autocorrelation properties in artificially constructed series .",
    "this efficiency is demonstrated in fig.1 .",
    "the scaling resulting from eq .",
    "( 8) was found also very satisfactory ( see fig.2 )    the performance of mf - dfa technique strictly depends on the power law scaling between @xmath53 order fluctuations @xmath33 and the box size @xmath26 ( see eq.(8 ) ) .",
    "an exact extraction of the generalized hurst exponent @xmath40 requires well determined scaling range for the linear fit @xmath54 against @xmath55 , induced by the power law in eq.(8 ) .",
    "the expected power law dependence for various lengths of the signal @xmath9 and for different values of deformation parameter @xmath32 is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the scaling range from @xmath56 till @xmath57 , confirmed by plots in fig.2 , and the second degree polynomial trends @xmath30 were chosen to be used further on .",
    "we considered the ensembles of numerically generated monofractal time series of length @xmath58 , @xmath59 with the pre - assumed autocorrelation exponent value @xmath60 , each containing @xmath61 independent realizations .",
    "thus , the spread of @xmath4 exponents covered uniformly the range @xmath62 .",
    "every obtained quantity has been averaged over such statistical ensemble .",
    "the width @xmath0 of the generalized hurst exponents profile @xmath40 was limited to the edge values @xmath63 .",
    "notice that the range @xmath64 is large enough for checking multiscaling properties of data from large to considerably very small fluctuations ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "the key numerical data are presented in series of plots in figs.4 - 7 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 , ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "first , the uncorrelated artificial data were studied .",
    "they have been generated from gaussian distribution ( @xmath17 ) , and also independently obtained as the shuffle of autocorrelated signals .",
    "fig.4a shows a dependence of the edge values @xmath68 of the generalized hurst exponents @xmath40 for two different lengths of time series : @xmath69 and @xmath70 chosen to investigate short and long data sets respectively .",
    "these plots not only confirm that shuffling procedure leads to the same results as gaussian distribution does ( what should be expected anyway ) , but also reveal the dependence of @xmath68 values on the data length .",
    "the corresponding plots for the intermediate lengths are not shown for they look qualitatively the same , i.e. @xmath68 does not change with @xmath4 for shuffled data but it does depend on @xmath9 .    this way , the spread @xmath0 of generalized hurst exponent versus length of data can be investigated for signals with no memory ( see fig.5a ) .",
    "the data drawn in log - log scale convince about the power law dependence between @xmath71 and the length of data series @xmath9    @xmath72    with some real constants @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "next , keeping @xmath9 fixed , we turned to investigate the edge values for @xmath75 versus the autocorrelation exponent value @xmath4 for monofractal signals with long memory .",
    "the examples of this dependence are shown in fig.6a for chosen lengths @xmath69 and @xmath76 .",
    "the cases of remaining lengths ( not shown due to lack of space ) have been checked by us as well and look similarly .",
    "all of them indicate an existence of the excellent linear relationship between @xmath75 and @xmath4 in the whole range of @xmath4 values .",
    "therefore , we get @xmath77 where the coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath79 are functions of @xmath9 only .    the boundary conditions , i.e. the form of @xmath80 and @xmath81 allow to specify the final shape of this relation .",
    "the profile @xmath82 can not be found directly , because one is stuck with singularity in ffm method for @xmath83 .",
    "therefore we made the extrapolation of the fitting lines @xmath84 versus @xmath4 up to the point @xmath85 for all lengths to get the collection of @xmath82 values .",
    "it is shown in fig.6a .",
    "the plot in log - log scale against the length of time series in fig.7a confirms that for fully persistent time series ( @xmath86 ) @xmath82 gets also the power law form : @xmath87 with some constants @xmath88 and @xmath89 to be determined from the fit .    inserting eq.(10 ) and",
    "eq.(12 ) into eq.(11 ) , we arrive with the final formula for @xmath90 @xmath91    in practical applications , the shape of the @xmath92 confidence level profile is important for the multifractal bias caused by fse and amplified by the presence of long memory in data",
    ". it shall be given by the same formula but with different coefficients calculated on the basis of @xmath93 uncertainties @xmath94 , @xmath95 associated with the fit of @xmath96 and @xmath97 parameters , where @xmath98 corresponds to boundary conditions at @xmath83 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "one has to include also the standard deviation @xmath99 resulting from the series statistics .",
    "the formulas given in eq.(10 ) and eq.(12 ) have to be replaced then by    @xmath100    with @xmath101 taken for the particular @xmath92 confidence level .    introducing the notation @xmath102 and @xmath103 one",
    "gets the @xmath92 confidence level profile for the multifractal fse bias as    @xmath104    the results of the best fit , done on the statistics of @xmath61 monofractal time series for all quoted coefficients with uncertainties entering eq.(15 ) and eq.(16 ) are indicated in table 1 .    these findings may also be summarized as in fig.8 .",
    "they show fse multifractal thresholds calculated at @xmath92 confidence level for @xmath0 spread in monofractal data series as a function of persistency level indicated by @xmath4 value and for variety of data lengths @xmath9 .",
    "the dotted horizontal lines present thresholds connected entirely with fse , not affected by eventual autocorrelations in data .",
    "the continuous sloped straight lines describe fse multifractal thresholds amplified by the presence of long - term memory in series and predicted by eq.(17 ) .",
    "the true multifractality , related with the existence of variety of scaling exponents in infinite system , may occur for consecutive series of given length only when the spread in generalized hurst exponents enters the area above this line ( at @xmath92 confidence level ) .",
    "this result clarifies and generalized quantitatively the statement from ref.@xcite on the existence of such threshold values .    .collected results for coefficients of the fit describing the multifractal fse thresholds in persistent time series according to eqs.(13 ) and ( 17 ) .",
    "the ensemble of @xmath61 simulations of time series was considered . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the summary given by eqs .",
    "( 27 ) and ( 28 ) for the dependence of the @xmath0 spread on persistency level @xmath4 for various lengths of data is presented in fig .",
    "two different behaviors indicated for @xmath4 above and below crossover value are noticeable .",
    "the transition area is visible due to the fact that two crossover values do not coincide ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "in the first part of this paper we have shown qualitatively and quantitatively how the observed multifractal effects arise in monofractal series of finite uncorrelated or persistent data .",
    "this kind of multifractality , called by us multifractal bias of finite size effect , should be clearly distinguished from the true multifractality caused by memory effects dependent on the time scale and thus related to different scaling properties of data at various time scales .",
    "the quantitative findings presented here confirm and push further the study of the generalized hurst exponent spread suggested recently in @xcite , to be not indicative for multifractality if @xmath106 or @xmath107 are obtained .",
    "although , found results refer to clearly synthetic monofractal series , they are important in practical applications , where in general , multifractal data are observed . results of the same methodology are affected in a similar manner for mono- and multifractal data and a similar level of the bias will appear in all multifractal data as well .",
    "we considered two methods of description for multifractality , i.e. the generalized hurst exponent approach and the multifractal spectrum analysis based on the hlder exponent . in both cases the multifractal threshold of finite data was estimated by the spread of generalized hurst exponent or by the width of multifractal spectrum .",
    "the threshold was shown to grow linearly with autocorrelation level in time series and to decay according to the power - law with series length .",
    "we have estimated numerically the level of such apparent multifractal effect and we captured it in simple semi - analytical formulas .",
    "additionally , in the second part of the article , we have discussed the multifractality revealed by the nonlinearly transformed monofractal data . in such a case , the finite size effects amplified by long - range autocorrelations in primary data are accompanied also by the fluctuation clusters arising from such nonlinear transformation of time series .",
    "this last effect changes the scaling properties of various fluctuation sizes and does not vanish in the limit of infinite data length .",
    "one must also keep in mind the influence introduced by nonlinear transformations , especially when only transformed data are searched and the goal are multifractal properties of the primary data series .",
    "the result of multifractal effect can be significantly dimmed in there .    in all cases",
    "the ready to use formulas describing amount of multifractal fse threshold or a multifractal modification of time series properties after some simple nonlinear transformations were given .",
    "we provided also results for statistical confidence at 95% level for all formulas , what enables the reliable estimation when they are used in practical applications .",
    "we believe these formulas are general enough to be applied in any area of science when one is questioning the multiscale properties of data .",
    "eventually , the predicted fse multifractal bias should be compared with examples of real multifractal records .",
    "there is a common agreement that multifractality is a characteristic feature for financial markets , so we may first look at index series .",
    "the multifractal features for various price indices were taken from the general study of ref .",
    "@xcite . by applying formulas from eq.(17 ) to parameters of real index series revealed in @xcite",
    ", we easy find that multifractality comes indeed as a result of scaling properties changing with the time scale for many world markets . however , there are markets where the observed multifractal features are generated mainly ( e.g. philippines , taiwan , germany ) or even entirely ( ireland ) by the finite size effects . in the case of philippines ,",
    "taiwan , thailand , germany , spain and greece almost 80% of the observed multifractality in price indices is caused by multifractal fse bias . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is reported that fse ( achieved for finite size surrogate data ) for djia time series counts for @xmath108 at @xmath109 , which agrees with the result of eq .",
    "( 17 ) predicting @xmath110 at @xmath92 confidence level .",
    "regarding other kinds of real data , e.g. in seismology , meteorology or geophysics , an importance of multifractal fse bias is also indisputable . the seismological records from refs .",
    "@xcite suggest multifractal spread of generalized hurst exponent @xmath111 for @xmath112 at @xmath113 ( see fig.3 in @xcite ) or the spectrum width @xmath114 ( see fig.5 in @xcite ) , while the calculated bias from eqs.(17 ) and ( 20 ) counts for more than @xmath115 of this value in case of @xmath116 and @xmath117 in case of @xmath0 .",
    "many records in meteorology and geophysics reveal high nonstationarity , so that authors focus on much narrower range of @xmath32 ( @xmath118 ) then used in this article .",
    "the quoted multifractal quantitative features for records in meteorology ( see @xcite ) are reported very low for humidity , temperature , solar radiation and maximum squall ( @xmath119 ) and more significant for precipitation , wind speed and atmospheric pressure ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) .",
    "however , to make a proper comparison with the fse multifractal bias in such a case , one has to examine how formulas obtained in this article change when lower moment @xmath32 is used for evaluation .",
    "the light on such problem is shed in coming publication @xcite .",
    "thus , the multifractal bias ( or apparent multifractality ) may play significant role in the observed multifractal spread , especially when short and persistent time series are considered . in many cases",
    ", it aggravates the separation between the main multiscaling phenomenon and the background ( bias ) of not multiscaling origin at all .",
    "therefore , one should be especially careful drawing far reaching conclusions from the multifractal analysis based on interpretation of observed @xmath0 or @xmath1 values .",
