    "galaxies at cosmological distances are known to emit polarized electromagnetic radiation according to certain statistical regularities .",
    "the processes range from linear polarization from radio galaxies due to synchrotron radiation , to centro - symmetric polarizations sometimes seen in optical measurements of qso s .",
    "the observables can include the percentage of polarization , a linear polarization angle , a galaxy symmetry axis , and the redshift of the galaxy , as well as the angular position coordinates of the galaxy on the dome of the sky .",
    "one typical correlation is an observed alignment of the bisector of a radio galaxy s long axis and linearly polarized radiation in the  fr1 \" class of objects .",
    "this has been interpreted as probing the source s magnetic field in conventional models . while this effect is in the context of conventional physics",
    ", other polarization correlations can test extremely small effects that might indicate new physics ",
    "sensitive to  cosmological birefringence \"  that might occur in the subsequent propagation .",
    "this has led to several interesting studies , from seminal early work on propagation in parity - violating electro - weak media by leo stodolsky @xcite , to the discussion of  optical activity of the universe \" by gabriel karl and collaborators @xcite , to recent studies of possible cosmological anisotropy in propagation @xcite .",
    "galaxy and polarization axes are labeled by angles , typically measured in  degrees east of north \" in a spherical -polar system of angular coordinates . the galaxy major axis projected into the tangent plane is measured with an angle @xmath0 . a linearly polarized electric field orientation in the same coordinates is assigned polarization angle @xmath1 .",
    "the angles , however , do not represent _ vectors _ in the rigorous sense , because a rotation of @xmath2 radians returns an axis to its original orientation .",
    "these observables are described by elements of the real projective group , which is not very familiar in physics . in this paper",
    "we will investigate and then automate proper transformation properties of such observables , and list quantities which are invariant under different symmetries .",
    "this provides a firm foundation for certain traditions and informal uses of variables which have sprung up in the literature .",
    "rather interestingly , the split - up of the three dimensional orthogonal group into disconnected subgroups of different parity also occurs for observables connected with polarization .",
    "one then has quantities which are even or odd under parity , which extends the list of symmetries one can test using polarization data .",
    "the physical motivation for this is as follows .",
    "consider a linear polarization correlated with an emission axis . from",
    " symmetry \" , statistics would naively be expected to show equal offsets of polarization axis relative to galaxy axis for either a positive or a negative sense of rotation .",
    "the particular  symmetry \" assumed here is _",
    "parity _ symmetry .",
    "while the emergence of parity as an observable may be surprising , it should be intuitively clear that observation of the converse would allow one to extract a definition of right  versus left handed senses of rotation from a data set , breaking parity symmetry .",
    "an even more obvious violation of parity symmetry would be preference for one kind of circular polarization over another . while one may not expect an object the size of a galaxy to break parity symmetry in its emission characteristics , the possibility constitutes a valid observable , subject to classification and study .",
    "another more interesting possibility , moreover , is to assume that objects do respect parity symmetry in a statistical sense upon emission , while the intervening medium can be tested for parity violation to an extremely fine degree .",
    "many models predict just such effects @xcite .",
    "we will proceed by setting up the transformation properties , listing covariant and invariant quantities , and illustrating the remarks by some statistical quantities which embody the ideas for data analysis .",
    "let us discuss transformation properties .",
    "we are not concerned with lorentz boosts , nor the usual lorentz covariant characterization of radiation in terms of the energy momentum tensor , etc .",
    "our focus is the  little group \" of angular variables in the rest frame of the observer , and the peculiar fact that the angles @xmath3 and @xmath4 actually observed give the orientation of  sticks \" .",
    "a rotation of just @xmath2",
    "radians about the axis of propagation makes no observable effect . due to this unusual transformation property , both the electric field and the galaxy axis",
    "are conveniently represented by certain tensors .",
    "let @xmath5 be the radial unit vector pointing toward a particular source .",
    "construct a local cartesian frame with its @xmath6axis oriented along @xmath5 ( fig 1 ) .",
    "the 2dimensional subspace orthogonal to @xmath5 is a plane tangent to the unit sphere of the sky .",
    "any consistent orientation of the local @xmath7 and @xmath8 axes spanning the tangent plane can be used ; one can always take these to be in the directions of increasing azimuthal and polar angles ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) relative to a global north pole ( hence the astronomer s  east of north \" ) .",
    "the electric field @xmath11 is transverse to @xmath12 and conventionally represented by a 2 component complex doublet , a convention hearkening back to optics @xcite . in the circular polarization basis , @xmath13 .",
    "the doublet notation is a hybrid and the transformation properties need examination .",
    "first , in averaging over many cycles of the wave , the observer does not actually measure the electric field .",
    "instead what can be measured is an hermitian density matrix @xcite @xmath14 . in our local coordinates ,",
    "the non  zero entries of @xmath15 are a @xmath16 block in the upper left hand corner of a @xmath17 matrix .",
    "if the coordinate system is rotated , this tensor will transform in the usual way , because @xmath18 and @xmath19 transform like 3-vectors .",
    "the unpolarized part @xmath20 is proportional to  @xmath21 \" with a proportionality constant fixed by the total power .",
    "the polarization density matrix @xmath22 is defined @xcite to be the rest of the matrix ,  as if \" it were a pure state .",
    "thus @xmath23 .",
    "this matrix is conventionally expanded in pauli matrices :    @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the degree of polarization , @xmath26 is a unit3 vector , and @xmath27 are the pauli matrices .",
    "equivalent are the  poincar \" coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath1 ( for describing elliptical and circular polarization @xcite ) : @xmath29 we have introduced the common  slash \" notation for contraction of a vector with the pauli matrix .",
    "we can also use @xmath30 for the @xmath17 matrix when no confusion between the two is possible .",
    "the polarization parameters have now been organized in a form convenient for transformations .",
    "consider the important case of a rotation of tangent plane coordinates about the propagation axis , that is the local z - axis , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 @xmath33 and in @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath32 takes the block form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is @xmath37 and unitary , in fact an element of so(2 ) .",
    "of course @xmath38 .",
    "this is the same rule as the rotations in the spin 1/2 representation , but in this case operating on vector components , not spinors .",
    "it follows that the parameters @xmath39 transform with the angle of rotation _ doubled_. as a check , a short calculation shows that a linear polarization oriented at angle @xmath1 relative to the local @xmath40axis gives @xmath41 in the local basis .",
    "the factor of  2 \" is just right to account for the periodicity of the observable plane of the electric field under rotations by @xmath42 ( as opposed to @xmath43 ) .",
    "this supports the informal use of @xmath26 in literature ranging from biology @xcite to astronomy @xcite , where the  2 \" is inserted intuitively and to make things come out right while making it clear that @xmath26 is not a true vector .",
    "the result is elucidated by the following general argument .",
    "recall the familiar decomposition of angular momentum ( @xmath44 ) states for the product @xmath45 .",
    "the states are labeled by @xmath46 representing the eigenvalues of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . however , since @xmath49 is transverse , all tensor products made from @xmath50 are absent . from the addition rule for @xmath51 , these absent representations are the @xmath52 states of @xmath53 , and the @xmath54 states of @xmath55 .",
    "this eliminates 5 of 9 possible combinations , leaving 4 total which are @xmath56 .",
    "the 4 possibilities are the 4 stokes parameters , with the total power @xmath57 being the singlet @xmath58 .",
    "the object @xmath26 , a deceptively vector  like position on the poincar sphere , is made from the peculiar combination @xmath59 . making a short calculation in the helicity basis , @xmath60 = i(e_+e^*_+ - e_-e^*_- ) = ( \\vec e \\times\\vec e^*)_z$ ] is the @xmath61 component , showing that the ellipticity transforms like a 3-vector attached to the photon s direction of motion .",
    "a similar treatment is needed for a galaxy axis .",
    "an observed galaxy axis is the projection of the physical major axis ( a signless eigenvector of a @xmath17 tensor of intensity distribution , say ) onto the tangent plane .",
    "we can again define in a helicity basis a 2 component @xmath62 .",
    "again @xmath63 is not a good variable , because the observable is actually projective , and we must identify @xmath64 . the associated @xmath37 matrix , @xmath65 , is part of a tensor embedded in a @xmath33 matrix . in our coordinates it can be expanded in pauli matrices @xmath66 the matrix @xmath67 transforms like @xmath68 and defines a 3 component thing , @xmath69 .",
    "note again the doubling of angles in @xmath70 , representing the information that @xmath63 and @xmath71 are now identified , just as informally practiced in the literature .",
    "( it is interesting that if one could deduce information on the  pitch \" of a galaxy , then @xmath72 could point out of the plane : such an axis might be  elliptically polarized \" , otherwise @xmath70 is in the local tangent plane . )",
    "we also have the position on the sky @xmath5 , which is a true vector and _ not _ to transform with doubled angles .",
    "finally we should classify the objects under parity : by definition we have that @xmath73 . @xmath70 and @xmath26 are only a little more work : since @xmath74 $ ] , with @xmath75 invariant , then @xmath70 and @xmath26 are invariant under parity ( although transforming in a complicated way under the full @xmath76 ) .",
    "now one can transform away from the special coordinate system , using general @xmath77 elements of @xmath34 , with the three objects @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath5 all transforming properly .",
    "we now turn to invariants one can make from the matrices @xmath80 and @xmath5 . a ",
    "local \" quantity will be one made from a single source , or ( if possible ) different sources at the same location on the dome of the sky ; a  non - local \" quantity anything made from sources at different locations .",
    "_ local quantities : _ since for any galaxy @xmath81 a coordinate system exists where all the matrix elements are in the upper left , then we have the covariant identity for such @xmath33 matrices @xmath82 the  1 \" of course means the 2 x 2 unit matrix on the upper left , covariantly written as @xmath83 . as a consequence of this identity an obvious invariant is reduced to a simpler form : @xmath84={1\\over 2}tr[\\slash{\\psi } \\slash \\chi ] = \\hat\\chi\\cdot\\hat\\psi.\\ ] ] it follows that @xmath85 , which is clearly invariant under the local rotation @xmath86 .",
    "it also follows that @xmath87 is even under parity .",
    "another useful quantity is the anti - symmetric @xmath17 commutator @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "this is dual to a pseudo - vector : @xmath89\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the completely anti - symmetric matrix with @xmath91 elements @xmath92 . in our local coordinate frame ,",
    "@xmath93 points in the direction of @xmath5 and is proportional to @xmath94 .",
    "the sign of proportionality depends on the right  handed convention for angles .",
    "this remains true however the coordinate system is rotated .",
    "the epsilon - tensor is even under parity , making it clear that @xmath95 is even and therefore a pseudo - vector by construction . since any quantity which is odd in @xmath96 reverses when a positive  sense \" of rotation is reversed to a negative one , such quantities are _ parity  odd _ on general grounds .",
    "this is not the only odd - parity observable .",
    "the helicity @xmath97 of the wave is defined in a lorentz - covariant manner as the projection of its spin along its direction of propagation .",
    "this is a pseudo - scalar : it must therefore be equal ( up to a constant ) to the product @xmath98 .",
    "the other invariants which can be made by contracting @xmath5 and the matrices are trivially zero .",
    "consulting the identity ( 1 ) above , there are 4 real - valued quantities in the products of the 2 matrices , which have now been classified into one scalar and one pseudo - vector , exhausting the possibilities for local bilinears of the two tensors .",
    "one can go further , and add another unit vector @xmath99 to the problem .",
    "such a vector is needed to quantify asymmetries of angular distribution .",
    "then one can make a scalar @xmath100 and a pseudoscalar @xmath101 :    @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the angle between @xmath99 and the position of the source on the dome of the sky .",
    "the pseudovector combination @xmath104 can also be considered , which makes the usual unit vector @xmath10 sitting in the tangent plane , transforming like @xmath105 . by the @xmath47 addition rule for angular momentum ,",
    "this can not be combined with the @xmath106 representations available from @xmath78 and @xmath75 to make new invariants . using @xmath5 , which transforms like @xmath61",
    ", we can take the @xmath61 part of @xmath30 and make a pseudo - scalar , but this is the helicity @xmath97 already discussed .",
    "continuing in this way , products of higher order can always be reduced to sums of smaller dimensional representations , much like the usual decomposition of angular momentum .",
    "some care is needed , however , because the polarization variables are made from incomplete representations because the fields are transverse .",
    "one generally then has fewer invariants than straightforward counting using rotation group methods might indicate .",
    "_ non - local invariants : _ combining different sources leads to some interesting quantities at low order .",
    "there is for example the familiar angle @xmath107 between galaxy @xmath81 and galaxy @xmath108 on the sky , given in terms of the true scalar @xmath109 .",
    "more interesting are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of @xmath110 and @xmath111 , or @xmath112 .",
    "it is straightforward to treat these by standard methods : thus the symmetric combinations @xmath113 ; \\ ; \\ ;   tr [ \\slash\\chi_i \\slash{\\psi}_j ] ; \\ ; \\ ; tr [ \\slash{\\psi}_i \\slash\\chi_j ] ; \\ ] ] are scalars ; while the antisymmetric combinations or commutators @xmath114 ; \\ ; \\ ; [ \\slash\\chi_i , \\slash\\psi_j ] ; \\ ; \\ ; [ \\slash\\psi_i , \\slash{\\psi_j } ] ; \\ ] ] are dual to pseudo - vectors .",
    "the quantities above are involved in questions of angular coherence : for example , if one wants to smooth the angular distribution of sources at different locations , while it would be a bit sloppy to add the parameters such as @xmath26 , in practice we are aware only of averaging polarization parameters over single sources of small angular dimensions , in a quasi - local way , so that this should not cause a problem .",
    "however if one were making a more ambitious study for example examining the degree of coherent polarization over larger regions of the sky  then more formal care would be needed .",
    "one can , for example , create correlation functions of the matrices in a consistent basis and evaluated at different angular positions , which are then reduced to scalars by taking traces .",
    "another interesting quantity is the @xmath115 , or helicity - helicity correlation function , and obvious generalizations removing the means .",
    "this quantity does not need a galaxy axis for its evaluation , and might probe parity - violating effects of the medium evaluated as a function of angular scales .",
    "this may be useful for optical polarizations , for example , which often are not associated with axial structure .",
    "an application of interest is the cosmic micro - wave background , for which polarization measurements can be expected in the future .",
    "_  distributions _    the classifications are useful in constructing statistical distributions or correlations which can be used to quantify observations .",
    "we will use a bracket ( @xmath116 ) symbol to denote an expectation value in a normalized distribution .    consider the problem of quantifying the correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath0 mentioned in the introduction . from our results",
    ", one would naturally assume the distribution to be a function of the rotationally invariant quantity @xmath117 .",
    "given that @xmath1 and @xmath0 are defined up to multiples of @xmath2 , the difference @xmath118 ranges in the most general case over @xmath119 , and not @xmath2 , as sometimes assumed @xcite in the literature .",
    "this is seen very simply by making sketches of some trial distributions .",
    "analytically one can expand the distribution @xmath120 in fourier series for integer @xmath121 : @xmath122\\ ] ] reality of @xmath123 must also be imposed ; it prescribes the negative integer values of @xmath124 , but does not restrict whether @xmath125 is even or odd .",
    "the coefficients @xmath124 for odd values of @xmath126 make @xmath117 periodic on the interval of @xmath127 , as claimed .",
    "restricting non - zero coefficients to even values of @xmath126 can be motivated by extra assumptions .",
    "one sufficient condition is that the distribution obeys overall rotational symmetry , giving @xmath124 going like @xmath128 .",
    "such an assumption might seem very general but in fact it is not .",
    "it is an interesting fact of optics that even a perfectly transmitting ( unitary ) medium can treat different polarizations dissimilarly , leading to a non - trivial distribution of @xmath129 as a signal .",
    "the same mechanism can create an anisotropic distribution of linear polarizations along a pencil through a medium from an random uncorrelated distributed set of linear polarization emitters . to simplify the analysis",
    "we will assume here , however , that the distribution of @xmath118 is periodic on the interval of @xmath2 .    to make invariant distributions from invariants , this leaves us with the quantities constructed earlier , namely @xmath130 and @xmath131 . a simple , and indeed well - known distribution that follows is the von mises form @xcite : @xmath132",
    "this distribution has often been used in likelihood tests , but unfortunately without discussion of parity symmetry . by construction",
    ", the @xmath133 distribution embodies a physical assumption that the twist of one angle relative to another has no preferred parity , which may be unsuitable in some cases .",
    "the  shifted \" von mises distribution is similar : @xmath134 .",
    "the parameter @xmath135 shifts the origin of @xmath118 and might seem to be free .",
    "however if parity symmetry is assumed , then @xmath135 is quite restricted .",
    "the distribution is a function of @xmath136 .",
    "parity symmetry requires @xmath137 , yielding @xmath138 , or @xmath139 .",
    "parity symmetry , then , is sufficient to predict that marginal distributions of linear polarizations tend to be oriented either along galaxy major axes , or perpendicular .",
    "this has been a misunderstood point , because of assertions that only the single choice of angular origin relative to the perpendicular is sensible . for any statistic which is covariant under a shift of origin , however , the matter is irrelevant , making no difference .",
    "transforming @xmath140 is equivalent to transforming @xmath141 in the @xmath133 or shifted @xmath133 distributions , showing that either choice is equally well described automatically .",
    "similarly , @xmath142 is odd in both @xmath118 and @xmath143 , a pseudoscalar no matter how angles are measured .",
    "another example of the issue is underscored by the paper of loredo et al.@xcite using the shifted @xmath133 distribution in a detailed likelihood analysis .",
    "the paper responded to an odd - parity statistic used in ref .",
    "@xcite , but exclusively used an even parity shifted @xmath133 model in its analysis . in replacing the original statistic by one with opposite transformation properties , conclusions were drawn on a false basis .",
    "this illustrates the problem that can occur when using functions from a different symmetry class than the idea being tested .",
    "there is in fact a long history of mix - ups from lumping together observables of different parity , which has led to interesting contention in the literature .",
    "birch @xcite in 1982 empirically observed a _",
    "correlation in radio polarizations , odd in the difference @xmath96 .",
    "kendall and young ( @xmath144 ) made a model distribution to explore this@xcite , choosing @xmath133 for the _ null _ distribution of @xmath118 .",
    "this is an implicit assumption of parity conservation in the null , which is perfectly physical ( but which should be stated explicitly ) .",
    "@xmath144 then set up a conditional correlation function @xmath145 which involved odd - parity to test birch s pseudovector result .",
    "unfortunately kendall and young did not explain the reason for their ansatz , which in retrospect was entirely appropriate .",
    "the overall @xmath144 distribution finally can be written in a nicely compact form @xmath146 where @xmath87 and @xmath101 are our scalar and pseudoscalars from the first section , making it clear that @xmath147 is a parity - violation anisotropic correlation parameter .",
    "likelihood analysis , for example , can be used in a perfectly objective way to see whether any parity  violating effects might be present or not in a data set , and entirely separate from the need to quantify the marginal distribution of @xmath118 .",
    "it is interesting that kendall and young s data analysis @xcite along such lines then indicated a high statistical significance for the parity -violating effect birch had observed ; more recent work in this regard can also be cited @xcite .",
    "however , other independent studies which used invariant correlations lumping together different parity seemed to contradict the result , a topic to which we now turn .",
    "_  correlations",
    "_    one of the best - known statistical correlation tests comes from an influential paper by jupp and mardia@xcite .",
    "their prescription for correlation between 2 angular quantities involves mapping them into  vectors \" @xmath148 , that is covariantly transforming elements , of which @xmath26 and @xmath70 are examples we have already seen . to test for correlations , @xmath149 use canonical @xmath150 correlation matrices @xmath151 which behave under the separate transformations of @xmath148 as the indices would indicate .",
    "then the @xmath149 correlation test is to calculate @xmath152,\\ ] ] with matrix products indicated , and where @xmath153 is the number of data points in the sample .",
    "the step of dividing by auto - correlation matrices is used to make the quantity scale - invariant .",
    "one easily finds that @xmath154 if @xmath155 and @xmath156 are independent , and the distribution of fluctuations in an uncorrelated null distribution has also be obtained@xcite . thus @xmath157 has served for many years as a useful simple test for independence .    unfortunately jupp and mardia , in discussing their correlation test , did not discuss parity and other discrete symmetries . in the problem at hand , to test whether the difference @xmath118 is correlated with sky position , one might consider the @xmath149 correlation of a  natural vector `` @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "this particular combination @xmath155 was used to test birch s correlation by bietenholz and kronberg@xcite .",
    "recall , however , the even - odd rule of parity for those quantities even - or odd in @xmath118 .",
    "it is clear that the above ' ' natural \" vectorlike combination @xmath155 needlessly mixes two quantities which are of opposite parity .",
    "the two pieces are also separately invariant under rotations , and should not be combined into a vector .",
    "ironically , history shows that the mixed parity combination was used while at the same time citing that birch had a correlation of pseudovector character @xcite ; without recognizing the parity properties of kendall and young s procedure , both their and birch s results were then rejected . from our analysis it is sufficient to use @xmath160 and @xmath161 , which allows separate tests of scalar or pseudoscalar kind .",
    "one can , of course , also work directly with scalar and pseudoscalar measures such as @xmath162 and @xmath163 to explore certain features of data , and create any number of statistics , once the proper transformation properties have been respected .",
    "we have classified several combinations of the polarization and angular correlation observables under parity and angular momentum .",
    "the features of local observables , and their simple appearance in classic distributions and correlation analysis , should be helpful to those interested in the area .",
    "while not exploring very far into the non - local quantities , they appear to offer many possibilities for interesting studies . the possibility of exploring parity violation when there are no obvious emission axis variables , as in the case of upcoming polarized cosmic -microwave background observations from ground - based and satellite facilities , seems intriguing and bears further investigation .",
