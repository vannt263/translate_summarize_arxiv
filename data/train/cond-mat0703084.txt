    "novel carbon materials are studied intensively due to their enormous potential utility .",
    "nanocomposite films are materials formed by various carbon crystallites embedded in an amorphous carbon ( @xmath0-c ) matrix .",
    "interest on these materials is growing since their properties , both mechanical and electronic are expected to tailor and improve the properties of the single - phase @xmath0-c system .",
    "depending on the density and the specific structure of the crystalline inclusion , the properties of the two parts of the system can intermingle leading to materials with diverse and interesting properties .",
    "the nanoinclusions can range from @xmath1 conformations to entirely @xmath2 ones , which in the absence of a matrix may interact _ via _ van der waals ( vdw ) forces .",
    "carbon composites have been studied theoretically @xcite , while there is also insight from experimental work .",
    "diamond composites formed by a nanometer sized diamond surrounded by @xmath0-c are potential candidates for superhard materials with applications in electromechanical devices such as mems / nems or as coatings .",
    "such composites have recently been grown @xcite in both hydrogenated and pure @xmath0-c matrices . on the other hand , carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) @xcite , which are fully @xmath2 forms of carbon have attracted many experimental and theoretical studies as they have inspired interesting advances in science .",
    "although their production methods are continuously improving , in many cases not only pure cnt but also other crystalline as well as amorphous carbon structures are formed .",
    "thereby , either intentionally or not , cnts can be found in @xmath0-c , forming films with potentially improved mechanical , thermal , and electronic properties for technological applications .    in this work ,",
    "we study some mechanical properties of carbon nanocomposites .",
    "recently , we investigated how diamond composites respond to the application of strain , in the regime where fracture occurs , and we extracted their strength @xcite . here ,",
    "instead , we focus on the elastic regime , i.e. , the region where the stress is still directly proportional to the strain applied .",
    "the elastic constants and moduli and the elastic recovery are the representative quantities to unravel the behavior of the two nanomaterials within this regime .",
    "computer simulations are used to model various @xmath0-c networks and carbon composites . the latter contain either a spherical diamond or a cnt , in order to capture the effects of a fully @xmath1 and a fully @xmath2 inclusion on the properties of the composite .",
    "monte carlo calculations within the empirical potential approach are carried out .",
    "these are effective methods for the analysis of structural and mechanical properties of composite systems .",
    "the atomic interactions are modeled by the tersoff potential @xcite . in the case of nanotube composites ( cnt/@xmath0-c ) , a typical 12 - 6 lennard - jones potential was also added to effectively model the interaction of the cnt atoms and those of the surrounding matrix @xcite .",
    "the parameters used for this potential ( @xmath3=2.964 mev , @xmath4=3.407  ) have been previously used to describe the bulk properties of solid @xmath5 and multiwall nanotubes @xcite .",
    "this scheme is capable of describing large systems , while it is also well tested and provides a fairly good description of the structure and energetics of a wide range of crystalline carbon and @xmath0-c phases @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the tersoff potential has been fitted and well tested with respect to reproducing the elastic constants , defect energies and phonon frequencies of diamond and graphite .",
    "work by mathioudakis and kelires @xcite showed that the potential describes well the variation and softening of elastic moduli of amorphous semiconductors as a function of temperature .",
    "in addition , it gives valuable information on the elastic properties and stress in various a - c forms @xcite .",
    "these issues are closely related and valuable to the present work .",
    "however , the potential does not describe @xmath6 interactions properly , due to the absence of dihedral - angle forces , giving rise to excessive @xmath7 mixed hybrids .",
    "the absence of repulsion between non - bonded @xmath8 orbitals @xcite leads to some overestimation of the density for a given sp@xmath9 content @xcite .",
    "this mostly occurs at intermediate sp@xmath9 contents , while low - sp@xmath9 ( evaporated a - c ) and high - sp@xmath9 ( tetrahedral ta - c ) networks are properly described in this respect . for ta - c ( sp@xmath9 fraction about 80% )",
    "the overestimation is @xmath10 3 - 4% .",
    "this shortcoming is not expected to seriously affect the energetics and elastic moduli of the nanocomposites , because these are determined primarily by the @xmath4 bond character of the network , which is very well treated by the potential .",
    "all structures were generated by quenching from the melt , a simulational method that is widely used to generate amorphous networks with a variety of different methods , ranging from first principles calculations or tight binding schemes to more empirical methods as the one presented in this paper .",
    "this procedure , produces generic structures that can not be directly associated with the nonequilibrium as - deposited structures , but can be definitely associated with and can be used to study the equilibrium ground state of carbon composite films , i.e. , with structures sufficiently relaxed under moderate thermal annealing .",
    "the generated structures depend on applied conditions , such as the quenching rate .",
    "this issue has been examined thourougly in previous studies @xcite .",
    "we use the optimized rates obtained in these studies .",
    "the structures also depend on the applied pressure ( variable volume simulation ) or the chosen initial density ( constant volume ) .",
    "we are able to produce a wide range of @xmath1 fractions by appropriately choosing the density / pressure of the simulation .    in the case of nanocomposites ,",
    "the crystalline atoms of the inclusion were kept frozen throughout the quenching process .",
    "after quenching , which produces amorphization of the surrounding matrix , the cells are thoroughly relaxed with respect to atomic positions and density .",
    "relaxations are particularly important at the interface region , where the crystallites mainly adjust to the host environment .",
    "one way of checking the stability of nanocrystals , is to subject them to thermal annealing .",
    "a stable structure should be sustained in the amorphous matrix , while an unstable structure should shrink in favor of the host .",
    "details have been given elsewhere @xcite , where it was also shown that diamond crystallites are stable ( under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium ) in dense @xmath0-c matrices @xcite , while nanotubes are stable ( or slightly metastable ) in low density matrices @xcite .",
    "here , we are interested only on these stable composites , which could be used for practical purposes .",
    "spherical diamonds or single - wall cnts of different sizes are embedded into amorphous matrices of various densities .",
    "cubic cells with periodic boundary conditions , containing 500 - 5000 atoms , were used and the diameters of the crystalline inclusions were allowed to vary . all the steps in the generation of the structures was done with the monte carlo method within the tersoff empirical potential approach .",
    "the nanodiamond diameters range from 0.5 to 2 nm , while for nanotubes they lie within 0.8 - 2.7 nm . for all structures ,",
    "the initial distance between the inclusions due to the periodicity of the cells is in the range 0.9 - 1.1 nm .",
    "after the generation of the matrix and the relaxation , this distance will vary as some @xmath0-c atoms at the crystalline - amorphous interface are expected to crystallize ( dense composites ) or atoms of the inclusions may amorphisize ( more dilute composites ) .",
    "representative models of all different structures , both composites and single - phase @xmath0-c , that have been studied here are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "simulations on multi - wall nanotube composites were also carried out . these will not be extensively analyzed , but will serve as a comparison to single - wall nanotube composites .",
    "all properties are calculated at a low temperature .",
    "the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) compositions of the structures given in the following analysis refer to the amorphous matrices , while the densities refer to the whole structure , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the amount of @xmath11 atoms for all cases studied here is negligible and the threefold ( @xmath2 ) atoms can be directly estimated from the fourfold ( @xmath1 ) atoms .",
    "the elastic constants and moduli of diamond and nanotube composites are studied using standard techniques @xcite at the lowest - energy configurations . these supplement previous results on their bulk moduli @xcite and are compared to the a - c values @xcite .",
    "strain is applied to the cubic cells and the elastic energy directly proportional to the elastic constants is obtained .",
    "the strain is small and leads to small deviations from cubic symmetry , allowing us to refer to cubic elastic moduli .",
    "a volume conserving orthorombic strain was applied to calculate the shear modulus equal to @xmath12 , while the @xmath13 elastic constant is given by shearing the cell with a monoclinic strain .",
    "the equilibrium bulk modulus @xmath14 was extracted through a fit to the energy - versus - volume curve using the birch - murnaghan isothermal equation of state @xcite .",
    "the young s modulus is calculated from the bulk modulus through the relation @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being the poisson ratio .",
    "this is defined as the ratio of the contraction normal to the applied strain divided by the extension in the direction of the applied strain . according to the theory of isotropic elasticity ,",
    "its values should be in the range from -1 to 0.5 .",
    "we show here that this ratio for diamond and nanotube composites is between 0.1 and 0.3 .",
    "the calculated @xmath14 for bulk diamond and for a free standing cnt of @xmath10 1 nm , using the tersoff potential , is 443 and @xmath10 200 gpa , respectively .",
    "these values are in very good agreement with experimental results for the former , and with _ ab initio _",
    "simulations for the latter @xcite .",
    ".moduli ( in gpa ) of diamond composites with a 1.7 nm diamond inclusion in a dense matrix with 80% @xmath1 content . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]    on the other hand , the rule of mixture does not hold for composites with nanotube inclusions .",
    "this is a direct evidence that cnts are strongly influenced by their presence in the mixture and show a stability which is in average lower than that for diamond inclusions .",
    "the axial @xmath17 and transversal @xmath18 young s moduli of a composite with a swnt inclusion of a 1.65 nm diameter are 564 gpa and 306 gpa , respectively .",
    "the values obtained by the rule are @xmath17 = 297 gpa and @xmath18 = 323 gpa . in general , the axial moduli compared to the transverse part deviate more from the values calculated through the rule of mixtures and the anisotropy of the elastic moduli of free standing nanotubes is enhanced by their embedding into the matrix . in the axial direction the embedding effect is stronger and",
    "leads to a strengthening along this direction , while a slight softening is evident along transverse directions .",
    "the matrix is an isotropic medium and the anisotropy is induced by the cnt .",
    "it is stronger for the axial part of the young s modulus due to the infinite length of the cnt in this direction , along which the cnt actually dominates over the matrix .",
    "this happens regardless of the density . in transverse directions ,",
    "the matrix contribution is stronger as it is leads to a softening along these directions .",
    "finally , we discuss the elastic recovery during a compression - decompression cycle of both composite and amorphous structures . experimentally , this is often performed by atomic force microscopy or standard nanoindentation and nanoscratch experiments .",
    "measurements for @xmath0-c films show that these recover highly elastic ( @xmath10 90% ) @xcite , but no variation with the @xmath2 fraction is known . in our knowledge",
    "there are no such experiments for the composites studied here and our results serve as predictions for the elastic recovery of these materials .",
    "computationally , by applying hydrostatic pressure on these composite structures their contraction can be measured .",
    "a permanent deformation signifies a decrease of the volume expressed as a fraction of its initial value .",
    "a perfectly elastic material would have an elastic recovery equal to one , while for a perfect plastic one it would be zero .",
    "cnt ropes , as an example , have been found to have high elastic recovery even under high - deformation conditions ( over 100 gpa ) @xcite .    in order to reveal the elastic response of the composites ,",
    "compression of all these stuctures up to 100 gpa took place , followed by full decompression .",
    "the behavior is directly dependent on the stability of the composites , i.e. , the more stable the structure the higher its recovery .",
    "we mainly focus on the stable composites , since these are the ones that are of technological interest .",
    "it is now more efficient to refer to the total @xmath1 component for each case in order to promote comparison with the composite stuctures .",
    "diamond composites are stable for an @xmath1 fraction over 60 - 70% , while for nanotube composites this value is in the range of 20 - 30% .",
    "the elastic recovery of single - phase @xmath0-c is determined by its density or hybridization .",
    "it is almost perfectly elastic in the highly tetrahedral regime ( @xmath19-c ) .",
    "the recovery is not perfect as the @xmath1 fraction declines , but it is again high in good aggreement to the experimental results mentioned previously .",
    "an almost fully @xmath2-bonded @xmath0-c network regains its initial volume at about 95 % . for a much higher compression ( up to 500 gpa )",
    "the dense networks again recover almost perfectly , but for the dilute ones ( fully @xmath2 ) the recovery drops to about 80 % .",
    "similarly , in diamond composites , the more stable these are the higher their recovery .",
    "it is again almost perfect ( even for compression up to 500 gpa ) , but as their density lowers the recovery drops to @xmath10 90% .",
    "taking into account the high incompressibility of the diamond crystallites the decrease can only be assigned to the matrix and mainly to its threefold atoms , which are more easily deformed .",
    "the response of nanotube composites is more interesting .",
    "although , they recover their initial volume over 90% , there are essential configurational modifications after decompression .",
    "the cnt retains its shape , but a few covalent bridge bonds ( @xmath10 1.6  ) between the cnt and the matrix have been formed . during decompression the volume",
    "is changed ( up to @xmath10 10% depending on density ) denoting that the system has been trapped into a local minimum .",
    "the bridge bonds , which start to form at a pressure close to 70 gpa , modify the structure and do not allow volume changes during decompression . in the case of unstable nanotube composites the volume change after decompression is again low , but inspection of the nanotube reveals the strong effect inflicted by the pressure .",
    "the tubular character is preserved , but the cross section is far from being circular , although no buckling similar to free - standing cnts undercompression was evident @xcite .",
    "the matrix and especially its part that immediately surrounds the inclusion is not seriously affected and no bridge bonds were formed .    a sample of all cases studied is summarized in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the elastic recovery for an @xmath0-c network with @xmath10 40% threefold atoms , as well as that for diamond and nanotube composites are shown .",
    "the composites shown were chosen according to their stability . in the case of @xmath0-c",
    ", we show a network that serves as an upper bound ( in terms of the @xmath2 fraction ) to the perfectly elastic @xmath0-c samples .",
    "more threefold atoms lead to deviations from this behavior as mentioned previously .",
    "the diameters of the inclusions and the @xmath2 fractions are 1.7 nm and 10% for the diamond composite , and 1.2 nm and @xmath10 60% for the nanotube composite .",
    "the number of threefold sites in the case of the diamond composite is small , but the elastic recovery is similar for large components , as long as the composite retains its stability .",
    "the compression curves for @xmath0-c and @xmath20d/@xmath0-c coincide to those for decompression , indicating the full elastic recovery of these structures .",
    "the curves related to cnt/@xmath0-c show a hysterisis representing the change in the final volume after decompression .",
    "this behavior is related to the structural modification in the final configuration mentioned previously .",
    "nanotube composites can be more easily compressed as shown in the figure . at the high pressure of 100 gpa",
    ", their volume can be reduced up to 25% from its initial value .",
    "the reduction for single - phase @xmath0-c is 18% , while it is even less for diamond composites . for the latter ,",
    "the @xmath2 component is much smaller compared to the cnt/@xmath0-c and @xmath0-c networks , but even for a larger component the compressibility is small .",
    "( a @xmath20d/@xmath0-c network with 73% of its atoms being @xmath2 is compressed up to 77% at 100 gpa .",
    "this value is again higher than it is for @xmath0-c and cnt/@xmath0-c . )",
    "our results indicate that the compressibility from cnt/@xmath0-c towards @xmath0-c and @xmath20d/@xmath0-c is decreasing .",
    "the crucial quantity for the degree of recovery is the @xmath2 content . as long as it remains high",
    ", there is no perfect elastic recovery . here , we only correlated this threefold component to the elastic recovery of the composites and @xmath0-c .",
    "a next step would include a more extensive study of the size of the nanoinclusion .",
    "a comparative study of the elastic constants of diamond and nanotube composites was presented .",
    "a systematic increase in these properties was found as the structures become more dense .",
    "the amorphous matrix and mainly the @xmath1 component contribute the most to this enhancement .",
    "study of the elastic response of all composite structures and single - phase @xmath0-c revealed a high elastic recovery .",
    "it is almost perfect for the stable composites and the amorphous networks , but decreases with increasing @xmath2 component .",
    "nanotube composites are more easily deformed , followed by the pure @xmath0-c networks and the diamond composites .",
    "the higher the @xmath2 fraction the higher the compression , which eventually leads to a lower elastic recovery .",
    "we thank g. hadjisavvas for useful discussions and s. kassavetis for helpful insights into his @xmath0-c related experimental work .",
