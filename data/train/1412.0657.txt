    "in recent years , a large number of hypervelocity star ( hvs ) candidates have been reported ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . here",
    "we define genuine hvss only as stars which will escape the gravitational potential of our galaxy .",
    "depending on the location and direction of motion , this criterion typically corresponds to a stellar velocity in the galactic rest frame @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "more than 50 stars can thus be classified as hvss ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : obs ] for a subsample .",
    "hvss can obtain their large velocities from a number of different processes .",
    "@xcite predicted the formation of hvss via tidal disruption of tight binary stars by the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) of the milky way . in this process",
    "one star is captured by the smbh while the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism .",
    "also exchange encounters in other dense stellar environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) between hard binaries and massive stars may cause stars to be ejected and escape our galaxy @xcite .",
    "a competing mechanism for producing hvss is disruption of close binaries via supernova ( sn ) explosions @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , the runaway velocities of both ejected stars can reach large values when asymmetric sne are considered , i.e. when the newborn neutron star ( ns ) receives a momentum kick at birth .",
    "the nature of the hvss spans a wide range of types from ob - stars , to metal - poor f - stars and g / k  dwarfs . while there is evidence from many late - type  b hvss in the halo to originate from the galactic smbh ( e.g. *",
    "* ) other hvss seem to originate from the galactic disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this calls for a detailed analysis to explain the kinematic origin of , in particular , the latter group .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate the maximum possible ejection velocities of hvss with different masses originating from disrupted binaries via asymmetric core - collapse sne .",
    "we use monte carlo techniques and perform a systematic investigation of the parameter space prior to / during the sn in order to probe the resulting velocities .",
    "the effects of sn shell impact on the companion star are included in our calculations . a particular focus",
    "is given to late - type b and g / k - dwarf hvss . in section [ sec : sn_model ] we briefly describe our model .",
    "our results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] and a discussion follows in section  [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "@xcite derived analytical formulae to calculate the velocities of stars ejected from binaries in which asymmetric sne occur .",
    "the velocity of the ejected companion star , @xmath3 depends on : the pre - sn orbital separation , @xmath4 ; its mass , @xmath5 ; the mass of the exploding star , @xmath6 ( in close binaries often a stripped helium star with a mass of @xmath7 ) ; the mass of the stellar compact remnant ( for a ns , typically @xmath8 ) ; the mass and the velocity of the ejected sn shell , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and the resulting impact velocity on the companion star caused by the ejected shell , @xmath11 ( which depends on the explosion energy , @xmath12 ) ; and finally , the kick velocity ( magnitude and direction ) imparted on the newborn ns , @xmath13 .    the major component affecting the maximum possible ejection velocity of the companion star , @xmath14 is its pre - sn orbital velocity , @xmath15 .",
    "hence , to produce ejected hvss it is clear that very close binaries are needed .    the minimum separation between the two stars prior to the sn explosion is assumed to be limited by the roche - lobe radius of the companion star .",
    "the reason for this is that the exploding star itself often fills its roche lobe ( via so - called case  bb roche - lobe overflow , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "thus to avoid the onset of a common envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may lead to a fatal merger event prior to the explosion , we must require that the companion star does not fill its roche lobe too .",
    "another required constraint in this investigation is that the post - sn trajectory of the ns will not lead to a merger event in an otherwise disrupted system , i.e. if the periastron separation , @xmath16 in case of motion along an inbound leg of the hyperbolic orbit ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 , in the notation of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is smaller than the radius of the companion star , @xmath19 then the system will likely merge and not produce a hvs .",
    "we applied equations  ( 5156 ) of @xcite on a large range of binary systems to systematically investigate the maximum possible ejection velocities , @xmath14 by using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the effects of the sn shell impact are discussed in appendix  a , and a quick sanity check on the applied equations is given in appendix  b.",
    "+    in fig .  [ fig : v2 ] , we have plotted the resulting values of @xmath3 as a function of kick velocity magnitudes , @xmath20 imparted on the ns for one specific set of initial parameters applied to late - type b - star companions with an initial mass of @xmath21 ( top ) and g / k - dwarf companions with an initial mass of @xmath22 ( bottom ) . in both cases we simulated @xmath23 explosions using an isotropic kick distribution .",
    "all ejection velocities in this letter ( @xmath3 and @xmath24 ) are quoted with respect to the c.m .",
    "reference frame of the pre - sn binary .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the values of @xmath14 peak when @xmath25 whereas the average values , @xmath26 keep increasing with @xmath20 ( approaching an asymptotic value as @xmath27 , cf .  appendix  b ) .",
    "it is also seen that the values of @xmath3 for g / k - dwarf stars are generally twice as large as those for the late - type b - stars .",
    "this is mainly caused by the difference in the applied pre - sn orbital separations , @xmath4 .",
    "the g / k  dwarfs are able to remain much closer to the exploding star without filling their roche lobes ( @xmath28 , for an exploding star mass of @xmath29 ) compared to the more massive , and larger , b - stars ( @xmath30 , for @xmath29 ) .",
    "furthermore , the g / k  dwarfs have smaller masses , @xmath5 . as a result of these effects ,",
    "the g / k  dwarfs have larger orbital velocities , @xmath15 prior to the sn , explaining their larger values of @xmath3 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vns - v2 ] , we plot the distribution of @xmath3 and @xmath24 for the systems with ejected g / k - dwarf stars plotted in the bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : v2 ] , and for which @xmath31 . in this case , as a result of the shell impact , the companion star decreases its mass from 0.90 to @xmath32 .",
    "about 1.9  per  cent of the systems survived as bound binaries , with an average systemic velocity of an impressive @xmath33 , and 3.1  per  cent of the systems merged as a result of the sn .",
    "the average velocity of the ejected g / k  dwarfs is @xmath34 .",
    "however , the entire interval of possible values of @xmath3 spans between 87 and @xmath35 for this particular setup .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : angles ] , we show that the value of @xmath3 is highly dependent on the direction of the kick imparted on the ns .",
    "the white area in the middle corresponds to cases where the newborn ns is shot into the companion star and the system is assumed to merge . for highly retrograde kick directions ( @xmath36 ) the systems remain bound , hence the white area at the top of the plot ( the shape of which depends on @xmath4 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "the sn - induced hvss with the largest values of @xmath3 are ejected close to the plane of the pre - sn binary ( @xmath37 ) , causing their spin axis to be almost perpendicular to their velocity vector . while the kick angle @xmath38 is chosen randomly , the polar kick angle , @xmath39 is weighted by @xmath40 in order to obtain an isotropic kick direction ( see fig .  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .     and @xmath38 .",
    "the colours represent the resulting ejection velocities , @xmath3 varying between @xmath41 ( red ) and @xmath35 ( blue ) .",
    "the plot was calculated for the same initial parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : vns - v2 ] . ]      as already hinted , besides the kick @xmath13 , the value of @xmath3 also depends on pre - sn parameters , in particular the pre - sn orbital separation , @xmath4 and the mass of the exploding star , @xmath6 ( see also eq .  [ eq : v2proxy ] ) .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dependence ] .",
    "the value of @xmath3 decreases both with increasing values of @xmath4 and decreasing values of @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath3 on the explosion energy , @xmath12 is quite weak . for example , using a constant @xmath42 and increasing the value of @xmath12 from 1.23 to 8  foe , only causes @xmath14 to increase by @xmath43  per  cent from 891 to @xmath44 .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath45 despite the increase in @xmath12 .",
    "we emphasize that our aim here is solely to calculate @xmath14 .",
    "the general values of @xmath3 are expected to be much smaller .",
    "although a detailed population synthesis is beyond the scope of this letter , we made a simple test and found @xmath46 , if we choose @xmath4 randomly between 3 and @xmath47 , and only apply @xmath48 .",
    "we have investigated the maximum runaway velocities of sn - induced hvss .",
    "however , one must bear in mind to add the galactic rotational velocity ( typically of the order of @xmath49 ) at the birth location of the binary system . hence , in the galactic rest frame we obtain @xmath50 .      from our simulations",
    "we find that only under the most extreme favourable conditions ( with respect to @xmath4 , @xmath20 , @xmath39 , @xmath38 , @xmath6 and @xmath12 ) is it possible for a late - type b - star ( @xmath51 ) to achieve @xmath14 up to @xmath52 ( in those particular cases @xmath53 and the final post - ablation stellar mass is @xmath54 ) .",
    "this value implies that @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , any observed b - type hvs which does not exceed this velocity at its origin , and whose trajectory does not point to the central smbh , could potentially be the result of a disrupted binary .",
    "however , we caution that the effect of adding @xmath56 is less important for the hvss high in the halo and also note that these stars lose some of their kinetic energy along the trajectory to their current location .    finally , we have investigated disrupted binaries with early , massive b - star companions ( @xmath57 ) . here",
    "we find @xmath58 , corresponding to @xmath59 , a significantly lower value compared to the late - type b - stars .",
    "we can reproduce g / k - dwarf hvss with runaway velocities up to @xmath60 ( in those extreme cases @xmath61 , and the final post - ablation stellar mass is @xmath62 for a pre - sn mass of @xmath63 ) . hence , in the galactic rest frame @xmath64 .",
    "such high velocities can certainly explain many , if not all , of the recently discovered g / k - dwarf hvs candidates @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , these hvss do not seem to originate from the centre of our milky  way , bringing further support for a disrupted binary scenario as to their origin .      in this work",
    "the aim has been to calculate the maximum possible runaway velocities for hvss ejected from disrupted binaries via asymmetric sne .",
    "the magnitude of the kick , @xmath20 has been treated as a free parameter ( besides the assumption of isotropy in the kick direction ) and we find peak values of @xmath14 for @xmath65 . an important question , however , is if such large kicks are realistic ?",
    "although the average kick velocities seem to be of the order @xmath66 ( inferred from studies of proper motions of young radio pulsars , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) there are nss which have received significantly larger kicks .",
    "these include the radio pulsars b2011 + 38 and b2224 + 65 which ( depending on their precise distances ) both have 2d velocities exceeding @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the latter pulsar is observed with a bow shock ( the `` guitar nebula '' ) which confirms that it is moving with a large velocity @xcite .",
    "another supersonic runaway pulsar with a velocity in excess of @xmath68 is igr  j11014@xmath696103 @xcite .",
    "finally , b1508 + 55 has an fairly precise measured velocity of @xmath70 based on vlba measurements of its proper motion and parallax @xcite .",
    "further evidence for large kicks can be found from combining simulations of the dynamical effects of sne with future observations of x - ray binaries with large systemic velocities , following the recipe outlined by @xcite .",
    "given the above - mentioned evidence for large kicks we therefore predict the existence of low - mass x - ray binaries ( and binary millisecond pulsars ) with peculiar systemic velocities in excess of @xmath71 , cf .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "theoretical simulations of sne ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) can also account for kicks in excess of @xmath68 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , our hvs simulations presented in this letter are based on a solid foundation of evidence for the possibility of large kicks .",
    "we have performed systematic monte carlo simulations to investigate the maximum possible runaway velocities of hvss ejected from disrupted binaries via asymmetric sne . for companion stars with initial masses of 0.90 , 3.50 and",
    "@xmath57 we find @xmath72 , 770 and @xmath73 , respectively . while a significant fraction of late b - type hvs have been shown in the literature to originate from the central smbh @xcite , we have presented evidence that , in particular , the majority ( if not all ) of the presently observed g / k - dwarf hvs candidates could very well originate from a binary disruption scenario . however , we caution that a more robust conclusion on the rates and the distribution of @xmath74 requires detailed population synthesis studies .",
    "finally , we note that a firm identification of a hvs being ejected from a binary via a sn is still missing , although a candidate ( hd  271791 ) has been proposed by @xcite ; however , see also the interpretation of @xcite .",
    "tmt cordially thanks warren brown and pablo marchant for comments and also acknowledges the receipt of dfg grant ta  964/1 - 1 .",
    "the formulae of @xcite include the impact of the sn shell on the companion star .",
    "this effect is significant and must be included when probing the maximum possible ejection velocities since these arise from the tightest pre - sn systems in which the companion star is relatively close to the exploding star ( and hence the cross - section for absorbing momentum of the sn ejecta is relatively high ) . to model the sn shell impact",
    "we adopt a modified version of the analytical formulae of @xcite , following the implementation in @xcite . while there are several studies published on the shell impact on the companion star in single - degenerate type  ia sne , no systematic studies are yet available on similar effects caused by core - collapse sne ( type  ib / c sne ) giant star companion .",
    "however , such a wide orbit ( and such a massive companion star ) is not suitable for our purposes here . ] .",
    "therefore , we use a new calibration based on more recent multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the impact of the ejected shell in single - degenerate type  ia sne systems ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "+    in figure  [ fig : sn - strip ] we show our calibrated fits ( dashed lines ) given by a slight rewriting of @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath19 is the radius of the companion star , @xmath76 is the surface escape velocity of the companion star ( typically , @xmath77 ) , and the parameter @xmath78 is a critical fraction of the radius outside of which a total mass fraction , @xmath79 is stripped and inside of which a certain fraction , @xmath80 is ablated .",
    "the latter parameters are found from fitted functions to the tabulated values of @xcite .",
    "after the sn shell impact , the new mass of the companion star is given by : @xmath81 , where we have adopted @xmath82 .",
    "finally , the average ejecta velocity , @xmath10 ( typically , @xmath83 ) is simply estimated from @xmath84 , where @xmath12 is the explosion energy of the sn ( although this expression is probably an overestimate by about 10  per  cent compared to the results from hydrodynamical studies of sne , cf . * ? ? ?",
    "strictly speaking , @xmath11 is an _ effective _ velocity assuming an instant addition of incident shell momentum ( stripping ) and subsequent momentum resulting from mass loss due to ablation of stellar material from the surface layers heated by the passing shock wave .",
    "although in a close binary the incident energy of the sn debris may exceed the binding energy of the companion star by a few orders of magnitude , this energy is deposited in the outer layers of the star whereby a main - sequence companion star can easily survive such an impact @xcite .",
    "a quick sanity check on our applied equations  ( 5156 ) of @xcite is made via their equations  ( 13 ) and ( 4447 ) , and reveals the results for the limiting cases with either no remnant mass ( as in the case of sne  ia ) or an infinite high kick velocity : @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath3 is the ejection velocity of the companion star and @xmath24 is the ejection velocity of the newborn ns ( both in the c.m .",
