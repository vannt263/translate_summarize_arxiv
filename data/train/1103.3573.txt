    "the properties of dilute polymer solutions under shear flow have been studied intensively  @xcite .",

    "similarly , the dynamics of individual polymers in a melt has been addressed extensively  @xcite .",
    "however , we are far from a similar understanding of the dynamics of semidilute polymer solutions , although insight into the behavior of such systems is of fundamental importance in a wide spectrum of systems ranging from biological cells , where transport appears in dense environments @xcite , to turbulent drag reduction in fluid flow . moreover , in semidilute solutions of long polymers , viscoelastic effects play an important role . due to the long structural relaxation time , the internal degrees of freedom of a polymer can not relax sufficiently fast under non - equilibrium conditions and an elastic restoring force tries to push the system towards its original state . here",
    ", a deeper understanding can be achieved by mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .    the dynamical behavior of dilute and semidilute polymer solutions is strongly affected or even dominated by hydrodynamic interactions  @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , scaling relations predicted by the zimm model at infinite dilution , e.g. , for the dependence of dynamical quantities as viscosity and relaxation time on the polymer length , are , in general , accepted and confirmed  @xcite .",
    "however , as the concentration of the polymer is increased beyond the segmental overlap concentration @xmath0 , where the volume occupied by polymer coils is equal to the total volume , the dynamics becomes more complex due to intermolecular excluded volume interactions  @xcite .",
    "for this regime , the scaling theory established by de gennes describes the polymer dynamics using the concept of blobs  @xcite . here",

    "inside of a single blob , the dynamics follows the predictions of the zimm model in dilute solution . on length scales larger than @xmath2 , hydrodynamic and",
    "excluded volume interactions are screened due to chain overlap .",
    "thus , the polymer dynamics on this scale can be described by the rouse model .",
    "when the concentration is further increased , the polymer dynamics is dominated by entanglement effects , which arise from physical uncrossability of chain segments for sufficiently long polymers .",
    "based on this theory , the relaxation time and also the zero - shear viscosity in the semidilute regime can be scaled by using the concentration ratio @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the segment concentration .",
    "various experiments confirm the predicted dependencies for the relaxation time and viscosity  @xcite .",
    "however , a systematic simulation study is still lacking , even though single - chain hydrodynamic simulations are well established  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty is that in the semidilute regime a large polymer overlap is necessary , whereas at the same time the segmental density has to be rather low to retain hydrodynamic interactions , which requires the simulation of long polymers @xcite .",
