    "stars born within primordial galaxies in the early universe form out of gas with no or little metals .",
    "these distant galaxies are , however , difficult to detect .",
    "nearby extremely metal poor ( emp ) star - forming galaxies are chemically unevolved , and thus offer important astrophysical laboratories for our understandings of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and star formation in the low metallicity environments @xcite .",
    "dust grains play a vital role in galaxy formation and evolution . characterizing the dust properties by investigating",
    "the infrared ( ir ) emission is a powerful way to understanding the ism and evolution of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the integrated dust properties of dwarfs have been investigated with @xmath10 space telescope .",
    "it is found that aromatic features are absent in the metal poor galaxies .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the ratio f@xmath11/f@xmath12 depends strongly on the metallicity ( where f@xmath13 is the flux density at wavelength @xmath14 ) , with significantly lower values ( mean ratio 0.08 @xmath15 0.04 ) for galaxies below one - third of the solar metallicity than those at higher metallicities ( mean ratio 0.70 @xmath15 0.53 ) .",
    "@xcite confirmed no polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) emission in low - metallicity galaxies , as well as other works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the hi - to - dust mass ratio as studied by @xcite is shown to increase with the decreasing metallicity to 12+log(o / h)@xmath168 , as @xmath16z@xmath17 , and flattens out at lower oxygen abundances .",
    "they also found an anti - correlation between dust temperature fixed to be 2 . ] and metallicity up to 12+log(o / h)@xmath168 , from t@xmath1623 k near the solar metallicity to t@xmath1640 k at lower metallicity , but a positive relation at lower metallicities .",
    "the _ herschel _ space observatory further extends the wavelength coverage into the far - ir and sub - millimeter wavelengths , which combined with the _ spitzer _ photometry significantly improves the measurement of the dust properties .",
    "the total gas - to - dust ratio as revealed by _",
    "herschel _ increases the decreasing metallicity .",
    "the slope of the relationship is -1 at higher metallicity ( 12+log(o / h ) > 8) and becomes even steeper at the lower metallicity end @xcite .",
    "it is also found that the metal content may not be the only factor affecting the dust properties of dwarfs .",
    "for example , the dust to stellar mass ratio of izw 18 and sbs 0335 - 052 , which have similar metallicities to the other emp galaxies in table  [ tab : properties ] , are very different ( 10@xmath18 to 10@xmath19 , and 10@xmath20 to 10@xmath21 , respectively ) as estimated by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the ratio for izw 18 is extremely low , while that for sbs 0335 - 052 is comparable to that found for normal spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "while significant progresses have been made in understanding the integrated dust properties of emp galaxies , spatially resolved investigations of dust properties of these galaxies are still rare , and thus the dependence of dust properties on the local condition is largely unconstrained in the emp galaxies . in this study",
    ", we aim to benefit from the high spatial resolution of the @xmath22 space observatory to investigate the ir emission of individual star - forming regions of four emp galaxies , with focus on the ir sed shapes and their relations to the local conditions .",
    "our sample of emp galaxies contains four objects including sextans a , eso 146-g14 , ddo 68 and holmberg ii ( ho ii ) .",
    "sextans a is a dwarf irregular at 1.4 mpc with 12+log(o / h)=7.49 based on the direct method @xcite .",
    "eso 146-g14 with a direct method based 12+log(o / h)=7.61 @xcite is a blue low surface brightness galaxy at a distance of 21.4 mpc .",
    "ddo 68 with a direct method based 12+log(o / h)=7.21 @xcite is a blue compact dwarf at a distance of 5.9 mpc .",
    "ho ii is a magellanic irregular dwarf at a distance of 3.3 mpc @xcite , with a direct method based 12+log(o / h)=7.92 @xcite .",
    "we also compared our results to the integrated measurements of the kingfish sample @xcite , the dgs ( dwarf galaxy survey ) sample @xcite , and other two emp galaxies ( i zw 18 & sbs 0335 - 052 ) .",

    "the main conclusions are :    \\(1 ) as compared to spirals and higher metallicity dwarfs , emp star - forming regions have on average much higher @xmath3 ratios at given @xmath4 ratios .",
    "in addition , single mbb fits to the sed at @xmath5 100 @xmath6 m show higher dust temperatures and lower emissivity indices , while two - mbb fits with a fixed emissivity index show that even at 100 @xmath6 m about half of the emission comes from warm ( @xmath8 50 k ) dust , unlike that seen in solar metallicity spiral galaxies .",
