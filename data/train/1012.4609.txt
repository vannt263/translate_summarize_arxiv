    "the three body problem ( tbp ) , consisting of three bodies with masses @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 that interact with gravitational forces , has been widely studied in the literature . it is considered either as a simple dynamical system with complex behaviour or as a model for explaining the evolution of planets and other celestial bodies . in this work ,",
    "we consider the planar case , where all bodies move on the same plane and the indices 0 , 1 and 2 refer to the particular body .",
    "the simplest , yet not trivial , version of tbp is the _ circular restricted tbp _ ( crtbp ) , where we assume that one of the bodies is massless ( say @xmath3=0 ) and the two massive bodies ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , called _ primaries _ , revolve in circular orbits on the plane .",
    "when the primaries revolve in elliptic orbits of eccentricity @xmath6 ( = @xmath7 and period @xmath8 ( = @xmath9 ) , we have the _ elliptic restricted tbp _ ( ertbp ) .",
    "when the massless body is replaced by a massive one , we get the general planar model of the tbp ( gtbp ) .",
    "especially , when one body has very large mass in comparison with the other two bodies ( say @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , we get the so - called `` planetary '' gtbp .",
    "continuation and existence of periodic orbits in this problem has been studied many years ago by hadjidemetriou ( 1975 ) and bozis and hadjidemetriou ( 1976 ) and recently their results found a fruitful field of applicability in the dynamics of resonant extrasolar systems ( e.g. psychoyos and hadjidemetriou , 2005 ; haghighipour _ et al . _ , 2003 ; ferraz - mello _ et al . _ , 2005 ) .    in most cases ,",
    "periodic orbits are associated with resonant planetary motion and their determination in the general tbp can be based on the unperturbed circular problem ( i.e. both planets are massless bodies ) .",
    "however , not all solutions can be constructed in this way . in voyatzis _",
    "( 2009 ) , it is shown that the main set of families of periodic orbits in the 2:1 resonance can be constructed by the continuation of periodic orbits from the restricted problem to the general one . in this scheme ,",
    "the role of families of periodic orbits of the restricted tbp is crucial .",
    "the origin of periodic orbits in the _ circular restricted tbp _ can be assigned to periodic orbits of the unperturbed problem .",
    "the structure of families of _ symmetric _ periodic orbits is well - known ( see e.g. bruno , 1994 ; hnon , 1997 ) .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. beaug , 1994 ; voyatzis _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) ) indicate that _ asymmetric _ periodic orbits exist only in resonances of the form @xmath12 , @xmath13 , called _ asymmetric _ , where for @xmath14 the massive body ( @xmath5 ) is the inner planet and the massless body ( @xmath15 ) is the outer one .    in the _ elliptic restricted tbp _",
    ", families of periodic orbits bifurcating from periodic orbits of the circular problem also exist having period @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are prime integers ( broucke , 1969 ) .",
    "many periodic orbits for the elliptic model associated to the dynamics of asteroids and kuiper belt objects have been computed ( e.g. hadjidemetriou , 1999 ; voyatzis _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) .",
    "all the periodic orbits found were symmetric . however , voyatzis and kotoulas ( 2005 ) found many bifurcation points along the families of periodic orbits and conjectured the generation of families of asymmetric orbits . in this paper , we compute and show the existence of such families in the elliptic restricted model and examine their continuation to the general model .    in the following section",
    ", we present our model and some basic notions on the description , existence and continuation of periodic orbits in the particular system . in section 3 ,",
    "we show how families of asymmetric periodic orbits can appear in the elliptic model and in section 4 , how such families are continued to the general problem . finally ,",
    "in section 5 , we conclude our results .",
    "considering the planetary tbp , consisting of a sun @xmath19 of mass @xmath1 and two planets @xmath20 and @xmath21 of masses @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , we define a rotating frame of reference in the following way ( see hadjidemetriou , 1975 ) : @xmath24 is the center of mass of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the axis @xmath25 is defined by the direction @xmath26 and the axis @xmath27 is vertical to @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , in the rotating frame , the position of the system is given by the coordinates @xmath28 ( for @xmath20 ) and @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( for @xmath21 ) , while the rotation of the frame is defined by the angular velocity @xmath31 of the axis @xmath25 with respect to the inertial frame .",
    "the lagrangian of the system can be written in the form @xmath32 + v\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the total mass of the system , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the distance of the sun and @xmath20 and @xmath36 we remark that @xmath37 is ignorable and , therefore , the angular momentum @xmath38 is constant .",
    "thus , the system can be reduced to three degrees of freedom . by taking the limit @xmath39 in the corresponding equations of motion",
    ", we obtain the equations of the elliptic restricted tbp .",
    "furthermore , by considering the consistent solution @xmath40const , @xmath31=const , the equations reduce to the equations of the circular restricted problem . in all cases , the system obeys the fundamental symmetry ( hnon , 1997 ; voyatzis and hadjidemetriou , 2005 ) @xmath41      an orbit @xmath42 of the general planar tbp is periodic of period @xmath43 if it satisfies the periodic conditions : @xmath44    a periodic orbit is _ symmetric _ when it is invariant under the symmetry @xmath45 and _ asymmetric _ otherwise",
    ". an asymmetric periodic orbit @xmath46 is mapped by @xmath45 to another periodic orbit @xmath47 which is the mirror image of @xmath46 .",
    "subsequently , all asymmetric periodic orbits appear in pairs @xmath48 .",
    "the first of periodic conditions ( [ eqperiodcond ] ) and the conditon @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 ) define a poincar section in phase space .",
    "studying the system on this section an asymmetric periodic orbit is assigned to a fixed point and is represented by a point in the 5-dimensional space of initial conditions @xmath51 a symmetric periodic orbit crosses perpendicularly the axis @xmath25 i.e. , additionally to the condition @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , a symmetric periodic orbit can be represented by a point in the three dimensional space of initial conditions @xmath55 the above periodicity conditions and the spaces @xmath56 and @xmath57 refer either to the gtbp or to the ertbp . considering the ertbp , where the semimajor axis @xmath58 of @xmath20 is fixed by the normalization of units , the variable @xmath28 is given by the eccentricity of the planet @xmath20 , namely @xmath59=@xmath60 or @xmath59=@xmath61 when @xmath20 is at pericenter or apocenter , respectively .    in the crtbp",
    ", @xmath28 is constant , defined by the normalization that is adopted for the system and @xmath62 .",
    "thus , by considering now the section @xmath63 , a symmetric orbit is defined as a point in the space of initial conditions @xmath64=@xmath65(@xmath66,@xmath67)@xmath68 and the asymmetric one in the space @xmath69=@xmath65(@xmath66 , @xmath70 , @xmath67)@xmath68 .      a periodic orbit of the crtbp is continued mono - parametrically ( e.g. by changing the energy integral ) forming families ( characteristic curves ) in the spaces @xmath64 or @xmath69 ( symmetric or asymmetric , respectively ) .",
    "along such a family the period @xmath43 varies . in the non - autonomous ertbp , the periodic orbits ought to have period which is an integer multiple of the period of primaries @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath71 . a periodic orbit of the crtbp can be continued to the ertbp , if its period @xmath72 is also equal to @xmath73 or @xmath74 . in the latter case",
    "the generated periodic orbit is assumed to be periodic with multiplicity @xmath18 .",
    "if we consider a continuation to the space @xmath56 with parameter the @xmath28 variable , which , as we have mentioned above , for the ertbp is related to the eccentricity @xmath75 of the primaries , the periodicity conditions are written as @xmath76 according to the implicit function theorem , the mono - parametric continuation to @xmath56 is possible if the jacobian of system ( [ eqcondpi5 ] ) has non - zero determinant , namely @xmath77 is the @xmath78 unit matrix . in case of symmetric periodic orbits ,",
    "the periodicity conditions ( [ eqcondpi5 ] ) hold for @xmath79 and eq .",
    "( [ eqcontpi5 ] ) is rewritten by replacing index 4 by index 2 . in general",
    ", @xmath80 has not a unit eigenvalue and , subsequently , ( [ eqcontpi5 ] ) holds and continuation to @xmath56 is generally possible .",
    "the cases where @xmath81 correspond to bifurcation points .    in the ertbp , the period @xmath43 in ( [ eqcontpi5 ] ) is fixed . in the gtbp",
    ", @xmath43 is the time span between @xmath17 successive intersections with the poincar plane @xmath62 and varies along the family of periodic orbits .",
    "continuation from the ertbp to gtbp is possible when we vary the mass @xmath3 and keep fixed the variable @xmath28 .",
    "also , in this case , we obtain again the periodicity and continuation conditions ( [ eqcondpi5 ] ) and ( [ eqcontpi5 ] ) , respectively .    in the gtbp , the initial conditions of a periodic orbit correspond to particular eccentricity values @xmath75 and @xmath82 , called _ osculating _ eccentricities , for the planetary orbits . for the representation of families of periodic orbits in the space @xmath56 it is convenient to use the plane @xmath83 . in this plane ,",
    "a family of asymmetric orbits coincides with its relative family consisting of _ mirror image _ orbits . also",
    ", the families of the crtbp lie on the axis @xmath75 or @xmath82 , since in this model one of the planet , @xmath21 or @xmath20 respectively , has zero eccentricity .",
    "the generation and the numerical continuation of symmetric periodic orbits in the ertb have been studied in applications concerning the resonant evolution of minor celestial bodies ( hadjidemetriou 1999 ; voyatzis and kotoulas , 2005 ) . as far as we know",
    ", any asymmetric orbits have been given in literature for the ertbp .",
    "we propose that such asymmetric periodic orbits can be obtained after two different types of bifurcation discussed in the following .      along the symmetric families of the ertbp",
    "the linear stability may change . at these cases we have critically stable periodic orbits",
    "where @xmath84 and , generally , @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , those orbits should be bifurcation points in @xmath56 for asymmetric families of periodic orbits .",
    "we note that the change in linear stability is a quite common fact in the ertbp ( voyatzis and kotoulas , 2005 ) and , therefore , the families of asymmetric periodic orbits should play an important role in its dynamics .     of the ertbp and the biffurcation of the asymmetric family @xmath86.,width=377 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig21btypei ] , a 1:2 family of symmetric periodic orbits @xmath87 is presented which starts from the bifurcation point @xmath88 , as an unstable family of period @xmath89 .",
    "point @xmath88 belongs to an unstable segment of a symmetric family of the crtbp and family @xmath87 starts also as unstable and continues parametrically by increasing @xmath75 . at @xmath90",
    "the family changes stability type and becomes stable . at this point ,",
    "@xmath91 , we have a bifurcation of the asymmetric family @xmath86 , which starts as stable .",
    "the family @xmath92 , which corresponds to the apocenter initial position of the planet @xmath20 , is unstable for all values of @xmath75 and , therefore , it does not show a bifurcation of this type .     and @xmath93 of the ertbp and the biffurcation of the asymmetric families @xmath94 and @xmath95.,width=377 ]    a similar structure as above is met in the 1:3 resonance ( see fig .",

    "i are also found for the 3:2 resonance .",
    "this resonance is neither `` asymmetric '' nor `` external '' , i.e. the massless planet @xmath21 revolves inside the orbit of the massive planet . in these cases ,",
    "the crtbp has no asymmetric families .",
    "particularly , the 3:2 resonance has a stable family of symmetric periodic orbits which shows a bifurcation point to the ertbp at @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) .",
