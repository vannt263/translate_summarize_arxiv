    "we carried out collision experiments to measure contact times and contact fractions as a function of the amplitude of the applied ac or dc voltages , and of the frequency of the applied voltage . in figure",
    "s1 we show data for a fixed stokes number ( @xmath69 ) and diameter= 16 mm .",
    "the applied ac voltage and frequency were varied from 2v to 5.3v and from 100 khz to 500 khz .",
    "the dc voltage was varied from 1.5v to 5v . as is evident in the figure s1 , no systematic dependence of contact time on supply voltage was observed .",
    "this suggests that electrical forces do not play a role in the dynamics of the collision .",
    "in particular , there is no observed change in the nature of the electrical signal , arguing that dielectric breakdown of silicone oil does not occur during the collision process .",
    "the literature value of the breakdown voltage is high but finite ( @xmath44 ) , so perhaps breakdown is avoided due to the very short time - scales of interaction .",
    "we thus infer that the values of contact time , flight time and contact fraction reported in this article are independent of voltage applied .",
    "contact time averaged over 20 trials at different voltages ( ac and dc ) and different frequencies for 16 mm sphere at 19.7 stokes number .",
    "the contact time does not show a systematic trend with voltage .",
    "the roughness profile of spheres used was measured with a diamond - tip dektak contact profilometer with lateral resolution of 0.5@xmath6 m and vertical range of 65.5@xmath6 m .",
    "the vertical resolution of profilometer is @xmath70 .",
    "the profilometer tip travels along a path of length @xmath71 along the surface of the sphere .",
    "we fit a circle to the height along the path traced by profilometer .",
    "this yields the global radius of curvature along this path as shown in fig .",
    "the deviations from this fit give the local roughness , @xmath21 of the topography of the surfaces .",
    "as can be seen from the statistics of @xmath21 given in table s1 , the etched 15.4 mm sphere s surface was found to be most rough ; as discussed in the main text , it is also the least heterogeneous , with relatively uniform roughness across the surface .",
    "a fit for the 15.4 mm etched sphere on the path traced by the profilometer as a function of position along a line on the sphere s surface is shown in red .",
    "the fit gives us the global curvature of the path and the local roughness of the sphere is obtained by subtracting the surface profile from this fit .",

    "@xmath79 is the reduced mass of the spheres and is given by                for a smooth sphere of diameter @xmath86 mm , the depth of the contact formed due to collision of the sphere with the plate for an impact velocity corresponding to @xmath53 is @xmath87 13.5  @xmath6 m .",
    "the radius of the contact area is then given by      this gives the diameter of the contact area = @xmath89 .",
    "of course , due to lubrication forces , the actual impact velocity will be much lower , so these calculations considerably overpredict the size of the crater made .",
    "a different possibility is that instead of the radius of the sphere setting the geometry of the collision , the local radius of curvature set by the roughness of the sphere is the relevant radius .",
    "if the characteristic height of bumps is @xmath90 and the characteristic lateral size is @xmath91 , the local radius of curvature will be given by      for @xmath93 m and @xmath94 m , @xmath95 = 900  @xmath6 m .",
    "if we use this radius in hertzian calculation for collision , we get the depth and radius of the contact area to be @xmath87 20  @xmath6 m and 200  @xmath6 m , respectively .    at the largest stokes numbers , we see that the sphere s impact on the plate leaves small craters ( fig .",
    "s3 ) @xmath87 700  @xmath6 m , thus the hertzian calculation must be replaced by a calculation involving material plasticity .",
    "finally , we recall that all these estimates have used the stokes number computed without wall effects ( as discussed in main article ) , thus the actual impact velocity will be lower . these estimates therefore overpredict the size of the region of contact ."

    "<S> our goal here is to determine whether solid - on - solid impact occurs during bouncing collisions , and more generally whether solid dissipation plays a role in determining the transition from bouncing to settling .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite in 1986 within an elastohydrodynamic calculation . </S>",
    "<S> working within the lubrication approximation , they suggested that the pressure in the thin fluid film between the spheres is large enough to produce an elastic deformation of the spheres . </S>",
    "<S> the stored elastic strain energy that is released in the form of kinetic energy was predicted to lead to rebound of the colliding particles without solid - on - solid contact . </S>",
    "<S> this idea is surprising as it suggests that a solid elastic sphere gets deformed by the fluid pressure sufficiently to reverse its momentum .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now generally held that the pertinent number that decides the dynamics of the bounce is the particle s stokes number @xmath0 , defined as @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the velocity of the sphere , @xmath3 is the diameter of the sphere , @xmath4 is the density of the sphere , @xmath5 is the density of the fluid , @xmath6 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and @xmath7 is the reynolds number of the sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the theory predicts a critical stokes number @xmath8 , below which the mutual approach between smooth bodies does not result in a bounce .    </S>",

    "<S> surface roughness can begin to play a role when the fluid layer separating the solids becomes comparable to the height of the asperities . </S>",
    "<S> davis @xcite included the effect of surface roughness by solving the equation of motion in two steps , first using the lubrication approximation until a cutoff distance set by the roughness , and then reversing the motion using the dry coefficient of restitution for an inelastic collision . </S>",
    "<S> barnocky and davis @xcite experimentally explored the predicted logarithmic dependence of @xmath8 on the surface roughness . </S>",
    "<S> joseph et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite use spheres with well - characterized roughness and argued that the differing level of scatter in their data from one type of sphere to another can be explained by surface roughness . </S>",
    "<S> other short - range forces such as van der waals forces could conceivably play a role very close to contact , but these are not considered in these pictures of bouncing .    however , whether contact occurs or not during rebound is still not established . </S>",
    "<S> all the experiments till now have been conducted using high speed cameras which can not resolve spatially or temporally the contact dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it is essential to study the dynamics close to the impact point , both in time and space to clearly check when and how contact occurs . </S>",

    "<S> next , we explore the regime and nature of that contact .    </S>",
    "<S> we define contact fraction , @xmath45 , as the fraction of experiments at a particular stokes number in which the sphere made contact with the plate s surface during the bounce i.e. collisions as shown in figure  [ fig : contact ] ( b ) and ( c ) . in figure  [ fig : avgcontact ] ( a ) , we plot the contact fraction , @xmath45 , as a function of stokes number . </S>",

    "<S> the value of @xmath47 that marks the transition to bouncing with mechanical contact is consistent with the bouncing transition within the scatter of previous experiments @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> is increased above @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> calculations for a hertzian , elastic impact @xcite predict a very weak dependency of contact time on velocity , @xmath40 @xmath48 @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the effective radius at the point of contact . for perfectly smooth spheres , @xmath51 , whereas the @xmath50 will be smaller when a bump on the sphere is presented to the plane . </S>",
    "<S> contact times for the etched spheres are slightly longer than those for the unetched spheres ( which have very similar contact times for both sizes of sphere ) . </S>",
    "<S> the roughness of the sphere , rather than the sphere radius , possibly sets the relevant curvature at impact and therefore influences the contact time . </S>",
    "<S> ( we discuss the relative scales of roughness and hertzian impact size in the supplementary information ) .    in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : avgcontact ] ( c ) we show data for the time spent in between the bounce and the next collision , which we refer to as the flight time @xmath41 . </S>",

    "<S> as expected , this is an increasing function of ( @xmath52 ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there is little or no variation with the type of sphere used , as opposed to the data for @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the details of the solid contact may not affect the total dissipation , as elaborated below .    </S>",
    "<S> thus far , we have discussed mean values of the contact duration and flight times , averaged over experimental trials for a fixed @xmath0 . however , studying the distribution of @xmath40 and @xmath41 is revealing of the source of the dissipation and its relationship to surface roughness . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : timedistributions ] we plot @xmath41 versus @xmath40 for the two unetched spheres and the etched sphere for stokes numbers varying from just above @xmath8 to about @xmath53 . in most cases </S>",
    "<S> , we find a very broad distribution of contact times at a fixed value of @xmath0 , varying by up to an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> presumably this reflects the variation in the local topography of the sphere . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , we find much smaller variability in the flight time , particularly at larger stokes number . </S>",
    "<S> thus the total dissipation that occurs in the sphere - wall encounter , as reflected by the flight time , is not strongly affected by the duration of solid - on - solid contact . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the results indicate that despite the solid contact , the bulk of the kinetic energy of the sphere is lost to fluid dissipation in the collision .    at the largest stokes number a different trend sets in , </S>",
    "<S> most clearly observed in the etched spheres : the contact time @xmath54 , also becomes well - defined . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this reflects the fact that at large impact speeds , the effective radius of the hertzian contact becomes substantial , and averages over the roughness of the etched sphere . </S>",
    "<S> thus collisions at different locations are effectively similar in their contact mechanics and no longer depend on the details of the roughness . </S>",
    "<S> we might imagine yet another regime  as in the example of a ball bouncing in air  at even higher stokes numbers where the dissipation becomes solid - dominated , but we do not explore that regime in our experiments . indeed , even at the larger stokes numbers we explore in this experiment , we begin to observe plastic deformation in the form of pitting at the point of impact .    </S>",

    "<S> this may lead one to question whether our observations are relevant for spheres that are even smoother than the ball bearings employed in this study . </S>",
    "<S> a calculation for a rigid , smooth , sphere within the lubrication approximation is illuminating in this regard . as shown below , roughness on the nanometre scale </S>",
    "<S> is sufficient to generate a solid collision .    </S>",

    "<S> the vertical distance between ball and plane varies according to @xmath56 where @xmath57 and re is defined by the instantaneous velocity of the sphere , @xmath58 ( see figure  [ fig : setup ] ( a ) ) . </S>",

    "<S> is denoted @xmath59 . within the lubrication approximation </S>",
    "<S> the radial velocity of the fluid squeezing out between the plate and sphere has a parabolic profile . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a horizontal force balance between pressure gradient and viscous forces : @xmath60 where , @xmath61 is the pressure . </S>",
    "<S> integrating equation [ horizontal_balance ] over the height profile of the sphere @xmath62    between @xmath63 and @xmath64 gives the net pressure force @xmath59 . </S>",

    "<S> the velocity is significant and finite even for a roughness cut - off as small as @xmath68 for large enough @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> the dimensional axes are based on a steel sphere of diameter 16 mm , dropped from different heights . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal line at a velocity of 0.021 m/s is the critical velocity at height 1 nm and 10 nm required to move the sphere up by the same height ( 1 nm or 10 nm ) when the direction of the velocity is reversed.,width=321,height=264 ]    the lubrication approximation is questionable at small enough distances ; to make further quantitative comparison with experiments will possibly require going beyond elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory by direct numerical simulation . </S>",
    "<S> however , it seems clear that direct solid contact is likely to be a general feature , even close to the threshold of bouncing . within this regime , however , the dissipation remains dominated by fluid mechanics , and the contact mechanics are largely controlled by surface roughness and bulk solid properties . </S>",
    "<S> even though solid dissipation does not play a prominent role , the presence of solid - to - solid contact is potentially of great significance in several contexts such as wear , charge transfer , or chemical reactivity of solids in suspension .    </S>",
