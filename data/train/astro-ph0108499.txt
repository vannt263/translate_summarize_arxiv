    "the substantial eccentricity of the inner planet s orbit , @xmath20 , is surprising since other exoplanets with comparable semi - major axes have circular orbits . in the absence of other interactions ,",
    "tidal dissipation would erode @xmath21 as @xmath22 with ( goldreich @xcite , hut @xcite ) , @xmath23 adopting values appropriate for jupiter : radius @xmath24 , mass @xmath25 , tidal love number @xmath26 ( yoder @xcite ) , and tidal quality factor , @xmath27 ( goldreich & soter @xcite ) , yields @xmath28 yr .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the old age of the star .",
    "isochrone fitting suggests an age of about @xmath29gyr ( n. murray , private communication ) , which is consistent with the absence of chromospheric activity and the small projected rotational velocity , @xmath30 .    secular interactions with hd @xmath3 are undoubtedly responsible for the persistence of hd @xmath1 s orbital eccentricity ( mayor @xcite ) .",
    "results from calculations by lasker and benz displayed in mayor ( @xcite ) show that secular interactions between the inner and outer planets induce anti - correlated oscillations in the two planets orbital eccentricities .",
    "the anti - correlation results because secular interactions transfer angular momentum , @xmath31 , but not energy , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is related to @xmath32 and @xmath31 by @xmath34 similar phenomena are noted in the hierarchical triple star systems hd @xmath35 ( jha @xcite ) , hd @xmath36 ( griffin & gunn @xcite ) , and algol ( see , e.g. , kiseleva @xcite ) .",
    "we argue that eccentricity oscillations were tidally damped a long time ago , and that currently the planets maintain apse alignment (  [ sec : linear ] ) . in this state",
    "the orbital eccentricity of the inner planet is proportional to that of the outer planet , and both are steady on the secular time - scale . on the much longer tidal time - scale , the individual eccentricities decay , with the decay rate being faster for the inner planet .",
    "we utilize the properties of this system to constrain parameters that are not directly measurable . from the ratio of the two eccentricities , we place bounds on the inclination angle , @xmath37 , of the planets orbit plane and on the radius of the inner planet .",
    "we study secular interactions in @xmath38 s planetary system under the assumptions that the planets share a common orbital plane and that their apsides remain aligned .",
    "the former assumption seems reasonable for planets formed in a gaseous disk .",
    "the latter assumption is consistent with the currently observed approximate apse alignment ( see table [ table : parameter ] ) and is justified by the analysis in ",
    "[ sec : linear ] .",
    "these assumptions allow us to infer parameters of the planetary system from the observed eccentricity ratio .",
    "mutual secular perturbations of the planets orbits are calculated following a method devised by gauss ( @xcite ) as outlined in the appendix .",
    "equation describes the resulting periapse and eccentricity variations .",
    "however , as a result of inner planet s proximity to the star , it is subject to additional precessional perturbations of which the most important arise from its related tidal and rotational distortions ( sterne @xcite ) also appears as the apsidal motion constant in stellar literature in which case it is a factor 2 smaller than the love number .",
    "] , and from general relativity ( einstein @xcite ) .",
    "expressions for these precession rates are ,    @xmath39    note that in equation the planet s spin rate , @xmath40 , is scaled by its mean motion , @xmath41 , since we expect that tidal dissipation has produced approximate spin - orbit synchronization .",
    "we neglect smaller precessional contributions due to the rotational oblateness of the star and to the tidal distortion of the star by the planet .    numerically , the total rate of extra precessions amounts to , @xmath42 where we set @xmath43 and introduce the dimensionless number @xmath44 , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 assigned values appropriate for jupiter .",
    "observations determine @xmath47 , close to that of an @xmath48 polytrope , @xmath49 , whereas saturn has a smaller love number , @xmath50 ( yoder @xcite ) because it is more centrally condensed as a result of possessing a relatively larger core of heavy elements .    we incorporate the additional precessional terms into the secular perturbation equations ( see eq . [ [ eq : secular ] ] ) . in a state of apse alignment",
    ", there is no secular exchange of angular momentum between the planets .",
    "therefore , their orbital eccentricities are constant on the secular time - scale . moreover , the eccentricity ratio , @xmath5 , is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath51 .",
    "to match the observationally determined value of @xmath52 requires @xmath53 . this value is greater than the precession rate due to general relativity and provides evidence for the tidal and rotational distortion of the inner planet . because the inner planet is not observed to transit , @xmath54 , which implies @xmath55 .",
    "nearly pole - on orbits , @xmath56 , are excluded if we accept that @xmath57 , a conservative upper - limit as judged from fig .",
    "1 of burrows @xcite .",
    "this implies @xmath58 .",
    "figure [ fig : secular_search ] shows @xmath21 as a function of @xmath59 for different values of @xmath6 with @xmath60 fixed at its observed value .",
    "tidal dissipation in the approximately synchronously rotating inner planet decreases its orbital energy without significantly changing its orbital angular momentum .",
    "it follows from equations and that this causes @xmath61 to vary as @xmath62 .",
    "since secular interactions transfer angular momentum but not energy between the planets orbits , @xmath63 remains constant .",
    "conservation of total angular momentum leads to , @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "apse alignment implies @xmath66 , from which we deduce that @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "numerically , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , so currently @xmath21 and @xmath60 are damping on time - scales of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively ; @xmath21 damps faster than @xmath60 because the inner planet s semi - major axis is shrinking .",
    "in  [ sec : nonlinear ] we assumed that tidal dissipation had delivered the planets orbits into a state of periapse alignment . here",
    "we justify this assumption by studying the secular dynamics and tidal evolution under the somewhat inaccurate approximation of small orbital eccentricities .",
    "our starting point is the expansion of the secular disturbing function to second order in @xmath21 and @xmath60 . substituting the expanded disturbing function into lagrange s equations for the variations of the @xmath33 s and the @xmath74 s , and adding a term to represent tidal damping of @xmath21 , yields the following set of linear equations ( md2000 ) @xmath75 for the complex variable @xmath76 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath77 read : @xmath78 with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 ; @xmath82 is the usual laplace coefficient . the symbols @xmath51 and @xmath83 retain their definitions from  [ sec : nonlinear ] .",
    "in the absence of tidal damping ( @xmath84 ) , the general solution of equation can be expressed as a super - position of two eigenvectors @xmath85 with @xmath86\\ , \\exp(i\\,g _ * t ) , \\label{eq : defi}\\ ] ] where    @xmath87.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ eq : eigenvectors ]    we distinguish the two eigensolutions by @xmath88 and @xmath89 according to the plus or minus sign that appears before the square root in the expression for @xmath90 .",
    "since @xmath91 , one solution satisfies @xmath92 and the other @xmath93 .",
    "if we take @xmath94 , the @xmath89 solution reproduces the observed eccentricity ratio @xmath95 and apse alignment .",
    "is different from that required in  [ subsec : currenteratio ] because the linear approximation is inaccurate for @xmath96 .",
    "] the other solution has @xmath97 and anti - aligned apses .",
    "if both eigenvectors have non - zero lengths , the orbital eccentricities oscillate out of phase on time - scales of thousands of years ( @xmath98 ) as depicted in mayor ( @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath83 is finite , @xmath61 and therefore @xmath77 vary with time .",
    "since @xmath99 , the solution for the eigenvectors given by equation remains valid .",
    "however , the eigenvector components , @xmath100 , decay slowly with time as @xmath101 where @xmath102 . in the limit of small eccentricity ,",
    "the expressions for the nonlinear damping rates given by equation reduce to those in equation provided @xmath103 as is appropriate for the linear problem .",
    "each of the four eigenvector components has its individual damping rate .",
    "both components of the @xmath104 eigenvector decay more rapidly than those of the @xmath105 eigenvector .",
    "if the current state consists mostly the @xmath105 eigenvector with a small admixture of the @xmath104 eigenvector , both components in the latter would decay on time - scale @xmath106 , while the dominant components @xmath107 and @xmath108 would decay much more slowly , as @xmath109 and @xmath110 .    it is notable that the asymmetry in damping rates between the aligned and the anti - aligned solutions only applies if the inner planet has an orbital period @xmath111 days . for longer periods , the additional precession rates ( eqs . [",
    "[ eq : pretide ] ] - [ [ eq : pregr ] ] ) are unimportant and @xmath112 .",
    "both the survival of hd @xmath1 s orbital eccentricity and the locking of its apse to that of hd @xmath3 are straightforward consequences of secular and tidal dynamics .",
    "the ratio @xmath5 provides compelling evidence for the tidal and rotational distortion of hd @xmath1 .",
    "it constrains unknown system parameters by relating @xmath7 to @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath113 .",
    "apse alignment indicates that a minimum amount of tidal dissipation has occurred over the life - time of the system , taken to be @xmath114 gyrs . by requiring that this is at least 3 times longer than @xmath83",
    ", we deduce that @xmath115",
    ". it may also be possible to infer a lower limit for @xmath116 by integrating the orbits backward in time .    at the present time",
    "@xmath117 , suggestive of a @xmath118 mean motion resonance .",
    "this is probably just a coincidence .",
    "moreover , no physically important effects would be associated with this resonance should it exist .",
