    "optical color - magnitude ( cm ) diagrams have been used as scientific diagnostics in astronomy since the pioneering work of e.  hertzsprung and h.  n.  russell ( c.  1910 ) .",
    "while the cm relations for stars are now well established in terms of stellar evolution theory , the case for galaxies is less clear .",
    "the optical spectra of galaxies are dominated by the integrated light from stellar populations , and therefore , the existence of any cm sequence is related to a correlation of galaxy luminosity with star - formation history ( sfh ) , stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , chemical evolution and/or dust attenuation . in order to separate cm relations from color - morphology relations ,",
    "most of the study of cm relations has concerned galaxies of a similar morphological type .",
    "the principal relationship between color and morphology @xcite is that more spheroidal - like galaxies ( early types ) are generally redder than more disk - like or irregular galaxies ( late types ) .    a color - magnitude relation for spheroidal - like systems was first established by @xcite .",
    "the integrated colors become systematically redder going from globular star clusters , through dwarf elliptical galaxies , to giant ellipticals . later",
    ", more precise measurements of luminous e+s0 galaxies in clusters showed a shallow cm relation with a small intrinsic scatter @xcite .",
    "this relation was associated with a metallicity - luminosity correlation @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that a age - luminosity correlation also fit the spectroscopic data because of the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "@xcite ruled out the correlation with age being the primary effect because the predicted evolution of the cm sequence with redshift was more than observed in this case .",
    "thus , the cm relation for bright e+s0 galaxies has been established as a metallicity - luminosity correlation .",
    "the intrinsic scatter and slope of this ` e+s0 ridge ' can be used to place constraints on the star - formation and merging histories of these galaxies @xcite .",
    "color - magnitude relations for early - type spirals were established by @xcite and for spirals in general by @xcite .",
    "these cm relations are more complicated than for the e+s0 ridge for a number of reasons .",
    "the intrinsic is scatter is larger @xcite and the luminosity correlations can be associated with sfh @xcite , dust attenuation @xcite and/or metallicity @xcite .",
    "it is probable that for some morphological types and across some ranges of absolute magnitude , all three effects are significant .    when all morphological types are considered together , the color distribution of galaxies can be approximated by the sum of two ` normal ' gaussian functions , a _",
    "function @xcite .",
    "the bimodality of the galaxy population has been known qualitatively for some time .",
    "researchers general consider e+s0 galaxies to be early types and sa - sd spirals and irregulars to be late types , and @xcite noted that `` early and late morphological types occupy separate branches in the color - magnitude diagram '' . with the advent of large spectroscopic redshift surveys , it is now possible to precisely analyse this color bimodality as a function of absolute magnitude , for the field population in particular ( whereas previously clusters offered the best opportunity to study cm relations since all the cluster members are approximately at the same distance ) .",
    "a natural explanation for the bimodality is that the two normal distributions represent different populations of galaxies that are produced by two different sets of processes . in other words ,",
    "formation processes give rise to two dominant populations that have different average colors and/or color dispersions .",
    "evidence that the color bimodality is due to this comes from the clustering analysis of @xcite .",
    "when the galaxy population was divided into four color bins , the two reddest bins showed a similar clustering strength to each other , as did the two bluest bins , with a sharp transition in properties between them .",
    "this can be explained if the dominant effect is the fraction of galaxies that are part of the red or blue normal distributions , rather than the average color of the galaxies .",
    "galaxies that are part of the red distribution are more strongly clustered .",
    "@xcite used only colors to define a red sequence from a photometric redshift survey .",
    "the bimodality was observed out to a redshift of unity and the evolution of the red sequence was quantified .",
    "in particular , they noted a build up of stellar mass on the red sequence by a factor of about two since @xmath14 . this is _",
    "inconsistent _ with a scenario where red early - type galaxies form early in the universe and evolve passively to the present day , and it favors scenarios where the red sequence derives from merger processes .    for our color analysis",
    ", we use data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the sdss is unique for studying the cm distribution of low - redshift galaxies because the survey has obtained over @xmath15 redshifts for @xmath16 galaxies with associated five - color photometry .",
    "an overview of various bivariate distributions , including cm relations , is given by @xcite . here ,",
    "we focus on one particular color and analyse in more detail the low - redshift distribution of galaxies ( @xmath17 ; @xmath0 vs.  @xmath1 ) .",
    "we also extract luminosity functions for the red and blue distributions ( early- and late - type galaxies ) , relate our results to stellar mass and consider a merger explanation for the bimodality .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows ; in section  [ sec : data ] , we describe the sdss data and sample selection ; in section  [ sec : distribution ] , we show the cm bivariate distribution ; in section  [ sec : methods ] , we describe our assumptions , aims and the parametric analysis of the distribution , and ; in sections  [ sec : results ] and  [ sec : conclusions ] , we present our results and conclusions . a simple merger model is described in the appendix .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey @xcite is a project , with a dedicated 2.5-m telescope , designed to image @xmath18deg@xmath2  and obtain spectra of @xmath19 objects .",
    "the imaging covers five broadbands , @xmath20 with effective wavelengths of 355 , 467 , 616 , 747 and 892 nm , using a mosaic ccd camera @xcite .",
    "observations with a 0.5-m photometric telescope @xcite are used to calibrate the 2.5-m telescope images using the @xmath21 standard star system @xcite .",
    "spectra are obtained using a 640-fiber fed spectrograph with a wavelength range of 380 to 920 nm and a resolution of @xmath22 @xcite . in this paper , we analyse a sample of galaxies selected from the sdss main galaxy sample ( mgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that selects objects for spectroscopic followup to a limiting magnitude in the @xmath23-band .",
    "the imaging data are astrometrically calibrated @xcite and the images are reduced using a pipeline photo that measures the observing conditions , and detects and measures objects . in particular , photo produces various types of magnitude measurement including : ( i ) ` petrosian ' , the summed flux in an aperture that depends on the surface - brightness profile of the object , a modified version of the flux quantity defined by @xcite ; ( ii ) ` model ' , a fit to the flux using the best fit of a de - vaucouleurs and an exponential profile ; ( iii ) ` psf ' , a fit using the local point - spread function .",
    "the magnitudes are extinction - corrected using the dust maps of @xcite .",
    "details of the imaging pipelines are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "once a sufficiently large area of sky has been imaged , the data are analysed using ` targeting ' software routines that determine the objects to be observed spectroscopically .",
    "the mgs has the following basic criteria : @xmath24 the first equation sets the magnitude limit of the survey .",
    "the second equation sets the surface - brightness limit ( @xmath25 is the mean surface brightness within the petrosian half - light radius ) .",
    "this is necessary to avoid targeting too many objects that are instrumental artifacts .",
    "the third equation is used for star - galaxy separation .",
    "the limits have been modified since the beginning of the survey but over most of the survey , they are given by @xmath26 , @xmath27 mag arcsec@xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the targets from all the samples ( others include luminous red galaxies and quasars ) are then assigned to plates , each with 640 fibers , using a tiling algorithm @xcite .",
    "details of the mgs selection are given by @xcite .",
    "spectra are taken using , typically , three 15-minute exposures in moderate conditions ( the best conditions are used for imaging ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is typically 10 per pixel ( pixels width @xmath302 ) for galaxies in the mgs .",
    "the pipeline spec2d extracts , and flux and wavelength calibrates , the spectra .",
    "the spectra are then analysed by another pipeline that classifies and determines the redshift of the object .",
    "we use a well - defined subsample of the mgs called ` nyu lss sample12 ' covering 2400deg@xmath2 .",
    "we set limits on the magnitude as follows : @xmath31 over 30% and @xmath32 over 70% of the area .",
    "the 17.5-limit corresponds to earlier targeting when the imaging and targeting pipelines were significantly different from the 17.77-limit .",
    "this produces a sample of 207654 objects , of which , 94% have been observed spectroscopically .",
    "the remaining 6% are primarily missed due to ` fiber collisions ' , which means that the tiling pipeline is unable to assign fibers due to another target being less than 55  away .",
    "this is a limit imposed by the plate and fiber technology .",
    "when two or more mgs targets are within 55  of each other , a fiber is assigned at random to one of them . of the spectroscopically observed targets ,",
    "99.5% have reliable redshifts determined and , of these , 97.7% are galaxies with redshifts between 0.001 and 0.3 .",
    "we further restrict our sample to a low redshift range of @xmath33 and a range in absolute magnitude of @xmath4 , given by @xmath34 where : @xmath23 is the milky - way extinction - corrected , petrosian magnitude ; @xmath35 is the luminosity distance for a cosmology with @xmath36  = ( 0.3,0.7 ) and @xmath37 , and ; @xmath38 is the k - correction using the method of @xcite .- corrections were derived from kcorrect v.  1.16 . ]",
    "this produces a sample of 66846 galaxies with reliable redshift measurements .    including higher redshift galaxies can leverage better statistics on the bright galaxies but here we are also interested in the continuity between low and high luminosity galaxies .",
    "in addition , restricting the sample to @xmath17 , reduces evolution effects and uncertainties in @xmath39-corrections .",
    "@xcite reduced these types of uncertainties by @xmath39-correcting to the @xmath40 bandpasses .",
    "this is optimal for the median redshift galaxies in the mgs but is sub - optimal for low luminosity galaxies ( only observed near @xmath41 ) .",
    "therefore , we keep to the standard definition of @xmath39-corrections ( to @xmath41 ) .",
    "this also means that no extrapolation is required to get from the observed - frame bandpasses to the rest - frame @xmath42 and @xmath23 bands principally used in our analysis .",
    "for a spectral - type indicator , we use the rest - frame @xmath0 color defined by @xcite , and to convert to vega magnitudes : @xmath43 . ]",
    "@xmath44 this is used because , even without @xmath39-corrections , the @xmath0 color has been shown to be a nearly optimal separator into two color types @xcite .",
    "the @xmath42-band filter observes flux from below the 4000   break and thus any @xmath45 color is highly sensitive to sfh ( @xmath46 or  @xmath47 ) .",
    "we determined that using @xmath0 gave the most robust results for the analysis presented in this paper ( though @xmath48 gave a marginally better division by type for the more luminous galaxies ) .",
    "model magnitudes are used because they give a higher s / n measurement than the petrosian magnitudes , particularly because the @xmath42-band flux is generally weak and aperture photometry includes significant poisson and background - subtraction uncertainties .",
    "in fact , if petrosian colors are used , using the @xmath42-band may not be optimum .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the bimodality was most evident in the @xmath49 color .",
    "note that sdss model magnitudes are determined using the best - fit profile obtained from the @xmath23-band image and fitting only the amplitude in the other bands .",
    "the bivariate distribution of the sample in @xmath50 versus @xmath1 is shown in figure  [ fig : color - abs - mag1a ] .",
    "the bimodality is clearly visible with two tilted ridges representing the early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "the other @xmath45",
    "cm distributions appear similar ( after scaling the color - axis appropriately ) . for the @xmath51 cm distributions ,",
    "the bimodality is still evident ( at low luminosities ) but the late - type ridge appears to merge with the early - type ridge around @xmath52 whereas this occurs at slightly higher luminosities with the @xmath45 colors .",
    "this probably reflects the changing dependence of dust and sfh on the colors of the late - type galaxies . for the remaining cm distributions ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) ,",
    "the bimodality is not evident as the ridges have merged .",
    "before the distribution is analysed , there are two significant incompleteness issues to deal with : magnitude of 17.77 are rejected by the star - galaxy separation criteria . in addition , the low redshift sample ( @xmath17 ) analysed here will be less affected by these selection biases than the majority of galaxies in an @xmath56 sample ( median @xmath57 ) . instead",
    ", the brightest galaxies in our sample may suffer from deblending problems .",
    "large galaxies are more likely to be blended with foreground stars and they are well resolved , which means that photo is more likely to measure their fluxes incorrectly ( by stripping genuine parts from a galaxy ) .",
    "their colors should be less affected since deblending is applied equally in all bands .",
    "we also assume that this deblending issue does not significantly affect our results .",
    "some discussion of bright - end incompleteness is given by @xcite ] ( i ) galaxies of a given absolute magnitude and spectral type can only be observed within a certain redshift range , which in some cases is much less than the redshift range of the sample , and ; ( ii ) some galaxies are not observed due to fiber collisions .    to correct for the first issue",
    ", we weight each galaxy by a @xmath58  factor before recomputing the bivariate distribution , where @xmath59  is the maximum volume over which the galaxy could be observed within the sample redshift range ( @xmath3 , @xmath60 ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath59  by iterating to a solution for the @xmath39-correction at @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the factor , @xmath58 , varies from about 1.4 for the brightest galaxies ( set by @xmath63 ) , down to 1.01 at @xmath64 , up to 450/650 for the faintest galaxies ( set by @xmath65/17.77 ) . in the 17.77-limit region ,",
    "the sample is virtually volume limited between absolute magnitudes of @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( @xmath58@xmath68 ) .",
    "note also that this correction factor is principally a function of @xmath1 with little dependence on color at these low redshifts ( @xmath23-selected sample ) , which means that this correction is important for the determination of the luminosity functions but _ not _ for the cm relations .",
    "the class of galaxies that are not observed due to fiber collisions is not identical to the whole sample . on average ,",
    "these galaxies will be found in higher density regions . a very similar class of galaxies",
    "are those that are the nearest observed neighbors to the unobserved galaxies .",
    "these galaxies were , predominantly by chance , allocated a fiber instead of their neighbors . to correct for this issue , we weight these observed galaxies by 2.15 .",
    "this factor is determined from the number of unobserved galaxies divided by the number of unique nearest observed neighbors , plus unity .    the corrected distribution of galaxies is shown in figure  [ fig : color - abs - mag1b ] .",
    "the results of our fitting to the mean color values along the red and blue distributions are also shown ( described later ) . in the next section",
    ", we describe our parametric fitting to the bimodal bivariate distribution .",
    "first of all , we summarize our assumptions and aims before describing our parameterization and fitting procedure . our basic assumptions are given below .    1 .",
    "there are two dominant sets of processes that lead to two distributions of galaxies",
    ". 2 .   for each distribution",
    ", the average spectral properties vary contiguously with visible luminosity .",
    "this is reasonable because luminosity is correlated with the mass of a galaxy and gravity determines the movement of gas and stars .",
    "3 .   at each luminosity",
    ", each distribution can be approximated using a normal distribution in the difference between the near - ultraviolet and visible magnitudes ( a log - normal distribution in the ratio between the fluxes ) .",
    "this could result from stochastic variations in sfh , metallicity and dust content ( and inclination in the case of disks ) .",
    "note that for our discussion , we assume that the stellar imf is universal @xcite .",
    "our aims are :    1 .   to quantitatively determine the variation in the mean and dispersion of the spectral colors of each distribution , as a function of luminosity ; 2 .   to determine separate luminosity functions ; 3 .   to relate the above to physical explanations",
    "; 4 .   to define a best - fit cut in color versus absolute magnitude space to divide galaxies by type .",
    "our aims differ from other work on early- and late - type galaxies , in that , we do not use a cut in morphology or spectral type . instead",
    ", the analysis is based on the assumption of normal gaussian distributions .",
    "nevertheless , we can safely assume that the red and blue distributions , described in this paper , correspond in general to the traditional morphological definitions of early and late types because of the well - known color - morphology relations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that the bivariate distribution is the sum of two distinguishable distributions : @xmath69 such that @xmath70 is the number of galaxies between @xmath1 and @xmath71 and between @xmath50 and @xmath72 .",

    "the fitting used a weighted least - squares routine with a grid search in the @xmath77 and @xmath78 parameters ( narrowing from 0.016 to 0.001 ) .",
    "the variance in each separate bin was taken as poisson ( the sum of the galaxy weights squared ) plus a softening parameter for small number statistics ( two times the average weight squared at that absolute magnitude ) where @xmath88 is the number of measured counts .",

    "this expression can be derived by assuming a uniform prior in @xmath89 ( the average counts expected , which can be fractional ) , determining the probabilities of measuring @xmath88 counts for each value of @xmath89 , and finally calculating the probability - weighted mean - square deviation of @xmath89 from @xmath88 . using this variance estimate ,",

    "we have devised a new method of analysing color - magnitude relations based on considering double - gaussian distributions in color ( figs .",
    "[ fig : resolve - dg - a ] and  [ fig : resolve - dg - b ] ) rather than strict cuts on morphological or other properties . from this , we obtain cm and dispersion - magnitude relations for two dominant red and blue distributions , which can in general be associated with classical definitions of early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "these relations are evident across seven magnitudes ( figs .",
    "[ fig : sigma - var ] and  [ fig : mean - var ] ) but are _ not _ well fit by a straight line . instead , we find that a straight line plus a tanh function provides good fits ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sl - tanh ] , table  [ tab : t - params ] ) .    for both the red and blue distributions , we can associate the general trend ( the straight line part of the combined function ) with a universal metallicity - luminosity correlation .",
    "the tanh function can be associated with a transition in other properties of the galaxy population , which could include star - formation history and dust attenuation ( in the case of late types ) .",

    "in addition , we find that the number density per magnitude of the red distribution overtakes the blue distribution at about @xmath13  ( fig .  [ fig : lum - funcs - adj ] ) .",
    "these changes in properties of the galaxy population are in good agreement with the transition found by @xcite at @xmath13   using spectroscopic measurements .    in order to study the physical properties of each distribution separately",
    ", it is necessary to divide them . to do this , we defined an optimum divider based on minimizing the overlap between the two gaussian descriptions ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : divide ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : bimodal - bivariate ] ) .",
    "we note that this works well for galaxies fainter than @xmath151 . for galaxies more luminous than this , morphological indicators that also show a bimodality can work better at dividing the population into two types .",
    "thus , a weighted combination of various measurements ( from photometry , spectroscopy and morphology ) could provide a better division by type , with the weights varying with absolute magnitude .",
    "the luminosity functions of the two distributions are significantly different from each other ( figs .",
    "[ fig : lum - funcs ] and  [ fig : relative - red ] , tables  [ tab : lf - non - para ] and  [ tab : lf - schechter ] ) .",
    "the red distribution luminosity function has a shallower faint - end slope and a more luminous characteristic magnitude .",
    "the difference between the two distributions can be explained in terms of a merger scenario where the red distribution derives from more major mergers . to show this , we first approximately converted the luminosity functions to galaxy stellar mass functions ( fig .",

    "some discussion of mergers and a description of the model is given in the appendix .",

    "finally , we note that further work could proceed in a number of directions including : ( i ) defining an optimum division between the two distributions by combining various observed quantities ; ( ii ) analysing the spectra of each distribution ; ( iii ) studying the distributions of the morphological properties ; ( iv ) comparing the cm relations between different galaxy environments , and ; ( v ) simulating galaxy mergers and hierarchical clustering to test the cause of the bimodality . here",
    ", we propose that the double - gaussian fitting technique represents a model - independent way of defining a ` post - major - merger ' sequence , in that the uncertainties due to blue - distribution interlopers are quantified , without using a semi - arbitrary cut in morphology or spectral type .",
    "early - type galaxies tend to have more spherical geometries , more virialized motions of stars , less dust as well as redder colors .",
    "n - body simulations suggest that the geometries and the motions of stars , similar to those observed in ellipticals , can be produced by galaxy mergers @xcite .",
    "in addition , if the merger causes the gas and dust to be expelled and/or used up in a burst of star formation @xcite then the galaxy s star - formation rate will be lower ( at some later time ) than star - forming late - type galaxies .",
    "this in turn will mean redder colors for galaxies produced by mergers as long as any induced star burst does not dominate the stellar population or the merger occurred at high redshift , i.e.   as long as most of the stars formed at high redshift @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that a hierarchical merger model can reproduce the cm relation of cluster ellipticals .",
    "given these lines of argument , it is reasonable to suppose that mergers are the cause of the bimodality , with the red distribution deriving from major merger processes and the blue distribution deriving from more quiescent accretion ( with only minor mergers at most ) . to test this",
    ", we devised an illustrative non - dynamical merger model to see if the basic shapes of the gsmfs ( fig .  [ fig : lum - funcs - adj ] ) with respect to each other could be explained .",
    "the procedure for this model is described below .    1 .",
    "a population of galaxies is created with an initial baryonic - mass function described by a schechter function with a faint - end slope @xmath84 ( for simplicity , we assume that all the baryons will be used to form stars and thus can be related to the gsmfs observed today ) .",
    "the population is defined from about @xmath152 to @xmath153 .",
    "the characteristic mass and number density , @xmath150 and @xmath83 , are adjusted to best match the data after the simulation .",

    ", it is determined whether it will merge with a _ more massive _ galaxy based on a probability equal to @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the initial mass of the @xmath158-th galaxy .",
    "in other words , the probability is the sum of the more massive galaxies weighted by mass with an exponent @xmath159 , divided by the total mass in the population , multiplied by @xmath160 .",
    "the probability of the lowest mass galaxy merging with another galaxy is approximately @xmath160 .",
    "4 .   for each merged galaxy @xmath155",
    ", the mass is added to another galaxy at random but with a weighting proportional to @xmath161 for @xmath162 ( and 0 for @xmath163 ) .",
    "5 .   for each remaining galaxy , the fractional increase of its mass relative to its initial mass is determined .",
    "galaxies with fractional increases greater than @xmath164 are determined to be in the red distribution ( similar to the @xmath165 parameter of * ? ? ?",
    "the model gsmfs for the red and blue distributions are determined and @xmath150 and @xmath83 are adjusted to best fit the data , over the ranges @xmath166 for the red and @xmath167 for the blue distribution .",
    "the additional physical assumptions behind this scenario are : that galaxies form from quiescent accretion with a distribution in masses defined by a schechter function , and ; the probability of merging with a more massive galaxy is related to the number density and masses of all these galaxies .",
    "the model is simple in the sense that it is non - dynamical , the timing of accretion and merging is not accounted for , and the parameter @xmath159 hides the complex physics associated with forces on dark - matter haloes and their baryon contents .",
    "note also that we do not model the cm relations , only the gsmfs .",
    "figure  [ fig : merge - fit ] shows a best - fit example of the simulated gsmfs from this simple merger model .",
    "it reproduces the shape of the red - distribution gsmf with high accuracy and the approximate faint - end slope of the blue distribution ( though the shape is slightly different ) .",
