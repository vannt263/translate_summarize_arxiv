    "the launch of _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope in 2008 provides the opportunity to examine @xmath1-rays emitted from compact objects , and 117 @xmath1-ray pulsars has been detected with the first three years archival data @xcite . among all the pulsars detected by _",
    "fermi _ , 36 were directly found by the blind search in the @xmath1-ray band and 34 of them were identified as radio - quiet with the threshold of 30 @xmath2jy in radio flux density at 1400 mhz .",
    "the population of radio - quiet @xmath1-ray pulsars is expanding due to the continuous accumulation of _ fermi _ data and the improvement of the searching schemes ( e.g. , weighting @xmath3 test - statistic ; @xcite ) .",
    "this has imposed constraints on the pulsar emission geometry which suggests the radio emission and the @xmath1-rays are not produced in the same region of the pulsar magnetopshere . while the radio emission is originated from the cones emerged near the stellar surface , the pulsed @xmath1-rays are generally accepted to arise from the outer magnetosphere ( cf .",
    "cheng & zhang 1998 ; takata et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "the radio - quiet pulsars can be resulted from their different orientation of their radio beam and the observer s line - of - sight .",
    "therefore , determining the emission geometry ( e.g. magnetic inclination , viewing angle ) is important for a better understanding of their properties .",
    "however , the lack of knowledge in the phase relationship between the @xmath1-ray light curves and that in radio leads to an ambiguity in determining which peak in the @xmath1-ray light curves is leading ( see trepl et al .",
    "2010 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "therefore , pulsation searches in the other wavelengths , in particular in x - ray , are needed .",
    "only four of them have the x - ray pulsation detected so far ( halpern & holt 1992 ; lin et al . 2010",
    "; lin et al . 2013 ; marelli et al . 2014 ) .",
    "for those pulsars whose periodicities can only be detected in both x - ray and @xmath1-ray bands are usually classified as geminga - like pulsars with geminga ( i.e. psr b0633 + 17 ) as the prototypical example of this class @xcite .",
    "x - ray pulsations of three other known geminga - like pulsars , psr  j0007 + 7302 @xcite , psr j2021 + 4026 and psr  j1813 - 1246 ( marelli et al . 2014 ) were subsequently discovered . except for psr  j1813 - 1246",
    "which has a very hard non - thermal dominant x - ray spectrum , the phase - averaged spectrum of other three geminga - like pulsars have multicomponent which consists of a non - thermal contribution and at least one thermal component .",
    "the pulse profiles in x - ray and @xmath1-ray are dissimilar with an obvious offset .",
    "this suggests the pulsed emission in these two regimes are originated from different regions .",
    "while the aforementioned three pulsars have similar x - ray / gamma - ray properties , we note that the derived paramaters ( e.g. characteristic age , magnetic field and spin - down power ) of psr  j0007 + 7302 and psr  j2021 + 4026 are rather different from geminga .    on the other hand , the x - ray counterpart of 3eg j1835 + 5928 , rx j1836.2 + 5925 , identified by @xcite and @xcite has been considered as the  next geminga \" for a long time because of the lack of radio detection ( a flux density of the radio observation at a frequency of 1.4 ghz @xmath4jy ; @xcite ) , the similar spectral behavior and @xmath1-ray luminosity to geminga @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-ray pulsation of this source was finally detected by @xcite , and it was classified as a middle - aged pulsar ( @xmath5  kyr ) that is similar to geminga .",
    "the surface magnetic field ( @xmath6  g ) and the spin - down power ( @xmath7  erg s@xmath8 ) of psr  j1836 + 5925  is about 1/3 to those of geminga although its spin efficiency to convert @xmath1-rays is about one order of magnitude higher @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of the pulsation detected in other wavelengths does not allow us to compare the emission properties at different energies .",
    "therefore , periodicity searches at other energies , particularly in x - ray band , are require to constrain its high energy emission properties and enable us to compare its nature with other geminga - like pulsars .",
    "the x - ray pulsation have been long sought for this target @xcite .",
    "however , no positive detection has been reported yet .",
    "using the archival _ xmm - newton _ data of psr  j1836 + 5925 , we have performed a detailed temporal and spectral analysis observations . in this letter",
    ", we report the results from this investigation .",
    "in particular , we report the discovery of the x - ray pulsations from psr  j1836 + 5925  for the first time .",
    "the latest _ xmm - newton _ observations of psr  j1836 + 5925  were on 2013 february 14 and 16 ( hereafter 0214 and 0216 ) have a total exposure of @xmath9 44 and 39 ks ( obs .  i d : 0693090101 and 0693090201 ; pi : pavlov g. ) . during these observations ,",

    "mos1/2 ccds were operated in full - window mode and pn ccd was operated in small - window mode with a temporal resolution of @xmath95.7 ms which enables us to search for x - ray pulsations .",
    "we reprocessed all the raw data with the tasks _ emchain _ and _ epchain _ in xmm - newton * s*cience * a*nalysis * s*oftware ( xmmsas version 13.5.0 ) . for a rigorous analysis , we have excluded those events next to the edges of ccds and bad pixels , which may have incorrect energies . the good events with `` pattern '' for mos1/2 were selected in range of 0 - 12 to include single to quadruple pixel events , and those for the pn in the range 0 - 4 to include only single and double events . in our analysis , we only consider the events in the energy range of @xmath12  kev .",
    "we also noted that all investigations have been contaminated by the x - ray background flare .",
    "after removing all events which are potentially contaminated , the effective exposures were found to be 41.1  ks , 41.3  ks and 41.4  ks for mos1 , mos2 , pn observed on 0214 and 32.3  ks , 32.2  ks and 32.8  ks for mos1 , mos2 , pn observed on 0216 , respectively .",

    "kev , the random probability to yield the x - ray pulsation of 5.7715448470(3 ) hz at epoch of mjd  56338 is @xmath32 ( @xmath3 test - statistic ( ts ) = 37.1 ) with a single harmonic ( de jager & bsching 2010 ) .",
    "we have also computed the periodogram of rayleigh - test in the frequency range 5.76 - 5.78 hz which is shown in figure  [ pdetection ] .",
    "it clearly shows an x - ray periodic signal at 5.771545(5 )  hz with @xmath33 .",
    "the quoted error of the frequency corresponds to the fourier resolution of this observation @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the pulse frequency in @xmath1-ray regime . to compare the pulse profiles between x - rays and @xmath1-rays , we folded all the photons extracted from _ xmm - newton _ observations and those obtained from _ fermi _ observations within mjd  5615056520 in accordance with the @xmath25ray ephemeris table  [ ephemeris ] .",
    "we also divided the obtained x - ray events into three different energy bands , which are similar to the studies of three other geminga - like pulsars .",

    "nevertheless , the significance is too low for claiming the detection in the hard band ( @xmath3 ts=4.0 with a random probability of 0.2 ) , which can be ascribed to the small photon statistic .",
    ".,width=321 ]      because our adopted data have the total exposures of more than 80  ks , this enables us to place a tighter constraint on the x - ray spectral properties of psr  j1836 + 5925  than the previous investigations @xcite .",
    "we extracted the spectra of psr  j1836 + 5925  from a circle with a radius of @xmath38 centered at its nominal position in each epic data .",
    "the background spectra were sampled from a nearby circular source - free region with a radius of @xmath38 in individual dataset .",
    "we generated the response matrices and ancillary response files with the xmmsas task _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen_. since the x - ray emission from psr  j1836 + 5925  is relatively soft , we considered x - ray spectral fits in the energy range of 0.25  kev .",
    "we grouped each spectrum so as to have a minimum of 15 counts in each bin .",
    "we have examined each dataset individually and found that the inferred parameters are consistent within the tolerance of the uncertainties . in order to optimize the photon statistics , we fitted all the epic data obtained in these two observations simultaneously .",
    "the errors of the spectral parameters quoted in this letter are in @xmath39 for 2 parameters of interest ( i.e. @xmath40 above the minimum ) for single component models and in @xmath39 for 4 parameters of interest ( i.e. @xmath41 above the minimum ) for multi - component models .    for the tested single component models ( i.e. power - law and backbody ) , none of them can result in a statistically reasonable fit ( with reduced @xmath42 ) .",
    "it may indicate that the x - ray emission of psr  j1836 + 5925  comprises more than one spectral component .",
    "therefore , we proceeded to fit the data with multicomponent spectral models",
    ". we have found that the spectrum can be described by an absorbed blackbody plus power - law model .",
    "we firstly attempted to perform the fitting with all parameters to be free , which yields a column absorption of @xmath43  @xmath44 , a photon index of @xmath45 , a power - law model normalization of @xmath46  photons",

    "this results in a desirable goodness - of - fit ( @xmath49 for 85 d.o.f . ) .    as the column absorption can not be properly constrained , we also fitted the data with @xmath50 fixed at total galactic hi column density of @xmath51  @xmath44 in the direction of psr  j1836 + 5925  @xcite .",
    "this yields the best - fit parameters of @xmath52 , a power - law model normalization of @xmath53  photons  kev@xmath8  @xmath44  s@xmath8 at 1 kev , @xmath54  ev and a blackbody radius of @xmath55  km .",
    "the corresponding goodness - of - fit is @xmath56 for 86 d.o.f . which is statistically acceptable .",
    "the best - fit model and the observed spectra are shown in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "we have also considered the spectral fit with a dual blackbody model .",
    "however , the goodness - of - fit yielded ( @xmath57 for 85 d.o.f . ) by this model is worse than the power - law plus blackbody model .",
    "fixing the @xmath50 at the galactic hi value does not result in any improvement of the fitting .",
    "in this letter , we report the discovery of x - ray pulsations from psr  j1836 + 5925 .",
    "we found that the pulsed events both contribute in soft and medium bands ( 0.22  kev ) . on the other hand ,",
    "no indication of pulsation in the hard band ( @xmath582  kev ) has been found in our investigation .",
    "the x - ray and @xmath1-ray pulsation from psr  j1836 + 5925  have significantly different behavior .",
    "the pulsed @xmath1-rays have a structure of relatively sharp double peaks which are presumably originated from the curvature radiation emitted from the pair creation region in the magnetosphere .",
    "the spin period of @xmath59  ms and the characteristic age of @xmath60  myr suggest psr  j1836 + 5925  as a mature pulsar . assumming the emission is isotropic , the gev gamma - ray efficiency of psr  j1836 + 5925  is @xmath61 ( second @xmath62 pulsar catalog ; @xcite ) , where @xmath63 is the spin down power . the first uncertainty of @xmath64 comes from the statistical uncertainties in the spectral fit and the second is due to the distance uncertainty @xcite .",
    "this high efficiency of the gev emission is similar to @xmath65 of typical mature pulsar  geminga , if one assumes a 4@xmath66 solid angle . considering the possible overestimated distances and/or the beaming factor ,",
    "the aforementioned conversion efficiencies can be overestimated . taking the more realistic parameters into account",
    ", this might result in an efficiency @xmath67% .    in order to compare with geminga , therefore , we discuss the origin of the x - ray emission of psr  j1836 + 5925 . in the soft band ( see fig  [ pfxg ] ) , the light curve is essentially sinusoidal which suggests the x - ray pulsation is mostly originated from the modulation of the heated polar cap .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of a blackbody component inferred from the spectral fit .    to account for the power - law component",
    ", we discuss it in the context of the outergap model @xcite . according to this model",
    ", the non - thermal component of a canonical pulsar is synchrotron emission from the relativistic @xmath68 in the outer magnetospheric gap @xcite with a week absorption .",
    "the photon index is expected to be in the range of 1.52.0 which is consistent with the best - fit value . for the light curve in 0.7 - 2",
    "kev , its profile is apparently different from that in 0.2 - 0.7  kev which might suggests a different origin . in examining the relative flux contributions by the thermal and non - thermal component",
    ", we found that while the non - thermal flux takes @xmath69 in 0.2 - 0.7  kev its contribution is @xmath70 in 0.7 - 2  kev ( see also fig .",
    "[ spec ] ) .",
    "this suggests that x - ray pulsations seen in 0.2 - 0.7  kev and 0.7 - 2  kev might have different origin",
    ". however , the small photon statistics in the medium band precludes any firm conclusion .",
    "to better characterize the x - rays from psr  j1836 + 5925  in different energy bands , a deeper observation is certainly required . with a larger number of photons detected , we can also perform a phase - resolved spectroscopy to investigate how do the spectral properties vary across the rotational phase which will provide important inputs for a physical modeling of the pulsar .",
