    "the interaction of cold atoms with strong electromagnetic fields results in many novel , interesting experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "the relevant systems are characterized by an extremely high degree of control that enables one to explore various problems of general physical interest .",
    "the response to a rapid oscillating force is such issue and will be the subject of the present paper .",
    "recently , in a series of experiments , atomic billiards were realized  @xcite . in these billiards atoms",
    "were confined by a standing wave of light to move in planes .",
    "the boundary of the billiards was generated by a laser beam , perpendicular to the plane of motion .",
    "this beam rapidly traverses a closed curve , which acts as the boundary of the billiard .",
    "the boundary of the billiard is assumed to be approximated by the time average of this beam , and the force applied by the boundary on the particles is approximately the mean force applied by the beam .",
    "one expects that this approximation is valid when the motion of the beam is fast relative to the typical velocities of the atoms in the billiard .",
    "the billiards generated by the rapidly moving light beam motivated the present work .",
    "the more general physical problem , which is explored here , is the description of classical and quantum dynamics in presence of fields that oscillate with high frequency .    in traditional atomic physics one",
    "typically assumes that the fields which affect the atoms have an amplitude which is constant in space and is time independent .",
    "this assumption is justified since the wavelength of the light field is much larger than the size of the atom and the electronic ( internal ) degrees of freedom react to the periodic change in the field much faster then the external ones ( center of mass coordinate and momentum ) .",
    "the main subject of traditional atomic physics is the response of the internal degrees of freedom to this field .",
    "atomic spectroscopy is the most spectacular result of this line of research .",
    "the center of mass motion of the atom can be ignored in most laboratory experiments that explore the dynamics of the internal degrees of freedom .    for the field of atom optics",
    "the effect of the internal degrees of freedom on the center of mass motion is important , in particular near resonance of the external field with the internal motion ( level spacing ) .",
    "the force on the center of mass due to the internal degrees of freedom is given approximately by a dipole force  @xcite .",
    "the sign of this force depends on the sign of the detuning of the light frequency from resonance ( of the electronic levels ) .",
    "the motion of the atoms is manipulated by fields with amplitudes which vary spatially , resulting in a force on the center of mass of the atoms . in many cases",
    "the amplitude of the field can be assumed static .",
    "the atomic billiards described earlier consist of a time dependent field which results of the moving laser beam . even at high frequencies of the motion of this beam",
    "one might expect that this time dependence will have some dynamical consequences .",
    "the question is most interesting when the wavelength of atoms is of the order of the size of the billiards . in this work",
    "the effect of a laser on the center of mass motion of the atoms will be modeled by a time dependent potential .",
    "for some situations of physical interest this simpler model should still describe the dynamics in a high frequency field without the need to specify the dynamics of the internal degrees of freedom or the quantum aspects of the light field .",
    "therefore , in the present work the atoms are modeled by point particles moving in a rapidly oscillating potential that varies in space .",
    "this description is relevant for a wide class of light - atom interactions and is not confined to models of billiards , which motivated the present work .",
    "the classical dynamics of particles influenced by a high frequency field was studied in several contexts .",
    "kapitza investigated a classical pendulum with a periodically moving point of suspension  @xcite . in this `` kapitza s pendulum ''",
    "the motion can be separated into a slow part and a fast part which consists of a rapid motion around the slow part . the fast motion results in an effective potential for the slow motion . in some range of parameters this pendulum performs harmonic ( slow ) oscillations around the point where it points upwards .",
    "this point is unstable in absence of the time dependent perturbation .",
    "this phenomenon is called `` dynamical stabilization '' .",
    "later , landau and lifshitz generalized this result for motion in presence of a rapid periodic force with a spatially dependent amplitude  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and calculated the leading term in an expansion in powers of the inverse frequency .",
    "dynamical stabilization is used to trap atoms in electromagnetic fields .",
    "the most notable example is the paul trap  @xcite . in this trap time",
    "dependent electric fields are used to localize ions in the region where the field amplitude is minimal .",
    "the fields are well approximated by restoring forces which are linear in the distance from the equilibrium point .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is that of a time dependent oscillator .",
    "it is possible to find exact quantum mechanical solutions for this problem that are based on the corresponding classical system .",
    "that is , the states are simply related to the ones of the harmonic oscillator . therefore the states of the motion in the paul trap are known  @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to find some of the states of problems of a more general nature , even if only approximately .",
    "the work of kapitza was first extended to quantum mechanical systems in a pioneering paper by grozdanov and rakovi  @xcite .",
    "they introduced a unitary gauge transformation resulting in an effective hamiltonian that describes the slow motion and demonstrated that its eigenvalues are the quasienergies of the time dependent problem .",
    "the effective hamiltonian was calculated as an expansion in powers of the inverse frequency . in that paper",
    "the analysis is restricted to a driving potential that has a particularly simple time dependence . moreover ,",
    "the final results are restricted to forces that are uniform in space , a situation natural in standard spectroscopy , but too restrictive for the interesting problems in atom optics .",
    "these restrictions are avoided in the present work .",

    "in this section the dynamics of a classical particle moving in one dimension under the influence of a force which is periodic in time is studied . typically , solutions for time dependent problems",
    "can only be attained numerically . however , when the period of the force is small compared with other time scales of the problem it is possible to separate the motion of the particle into `` slow '' and `` fast '' parts .",
    "this simplification is due to the fact that the particle does not have the time to react to the periodic force before this force changes its sign , namely , the contribution of the periodic force to the acceleration in one period is negligible ( compared to the contribution of the effective force in a sense that will be specified in what follows ) .",
    "thus we will consider the limit of small periods ( or large frequencies ) of the driving field .",

    "later , this hamiltonian will be compared with an effective hamiltonian which will be derived for the corresponding quantum problem .",
    "the existence of such a hamiltonian might seem to contradict the fact that the time dependent dynamics do not possess a constant of motion .",
    "moreover , the classical motion may be chaotic .",
    "the existence of this effective time independent hamiltonian implies that a constant of motion exists for the slow dynamics ( it is just the effective hamiltonian ) , and for a one dimensional system the slow dynamics is integrable . to avoid confusion",
    ", it should be emphasized that the effective hamiltonian depends on a coordinate which describes the `` slow '' part of the motion .",
    "_ this coordinate is not the location of the particle _ ( although they are almost identical at high frequencies ) .",
    "the actual motion consists of rapid motion in the proximity of the trajectory of the slow dynamics .",

    "newton s equation for the motion in the periodic field is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a periodic function of @xmath9 of period @xmath10 and its average over a period vanishes .",
    "we denote derivatives with respect to coordinates by primes and with respect to time by dots .",
    "this separation of the potential to an average part , @xmath11 , and a periodic part with vanishing average , @xmath12 , is natural and will simplify the following calculations .",

    "an exact solution using  ( [ separation ] ) is too complicated to obtain .",
    "however , at high frequencies , one can determine @xmath16 order by order in @xmath5 . in order to separate terms in powers of the frequency it is convenient to introduce the new time variable @xmath20",

    "first , we note that the fast part @xmath16 is expanded in powers of @xmath5 while @xmath17 is not expanded , which seems to be inconsistent .",
    "one may also expand @xmath17 in powers of @xmath5 as @xmath29 .",

    "corrections of higher orders of @xmath5 to @xmath28 result from the corrections of higher orders to @xmath34 .",
