    "the past decades have seen many successes in the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) approach of the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "the relativistic framework has big advantages in several aspects @xcite : a useful dirac phenomenology for the description of nucleon - nucleus scattering @xcite , the natural incorporation of the spin - orbit force @xcite and the saturation properties in the microscopic treatment with the dirac brueckner hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach @xcite .",
    "furthermore this approach can explain very nicely the structure of such extreme nuclei as for neutron - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "these results conclude that there are large attractive scalar and repulsive vector - fields , and that the nucleon effective mass becomes very small in the medium .",
    "these deep scalar and vector fields predict very strong attractive potential of antinucleon ( ) and large suppression of the in - medium threshold energy of the nucleon - antinucleon ( @xmath0 ) pair creation because the vector fields is changed to be attractive for .",
    "kurasawa and suzuki @xcite showed that the largely reduced threshold energy of @xmath0   production in medium play a very important role to explain the suppression of the coulomb sum - rule in the quasielastic electron scattering .",
    "furthermore they showed that the gamow - teller ( gt ) transition strength is quenched by the antinucleon degree of freedom @xcite . the particle - hole",
    "( @xmath1 ) excitation explains 88 % of the ikeda - fujii - fujita ( iff ) sum - rule , and the other 12 % strength is given by the @xmath0-production .",
    "the shift of the strength from the @xmath1-excitation sector to the @xmath0-production sector increases as the effective mass becomes smaller @xcite .    in the rmf approach , thus , the largely reduced threshold energy play important roles in calculations of several low energy phenomena .",
    "however experimental observables about the antiproton have not revealed this deep  attractive potential .",
    "for example the analysis of the antiproton ( @xmath2 ) + nucleus elastic scattering has not shown its deep attractive potential @xcite .",
    "furthermore teis et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the subthreshold @xmath2-production experiments in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite and light - ion induced collisions @xcite and concluded that the @xmath2 mean - field is attractive but its depth is much smaller than that predicted in the rh approximation . particularly the results in the light - ion induces reactions gave important results that the the cross - section in the deuteron induced reaction , @xmath3 , is fifty times larger than that in the proton induced reaction , @xmath4 at the initial energy , @xmath5 gev / u : @xmath6 .",
    "if the @xmath2 potential is as deep as that in the rh approximation , this initial energy is above the threshold energy , and the ratio must be close to the nucleon number of the induced particles , namely @xmath7 .",

    "for example , g.q .",

    "only the rh approximation suggests the deep  potential , but one can deny it by extending the theory , such as the relativistic hartree - fock ( rhf ) , including the nonlocal parts @xcite . in the rhf framework , furthermore , the self - energies of nucleon are momentum - dependent and have different values between the on - mass - shell state and the off - mass - shell states @xcite .",
    "the antinucleon appearing in calculations of low energy phenomena must be at an off - mass - shell state , and its property may be different from that at the on - mass - shell state . if the antinucleon properties at the off - mass - shell state is different , moreover , we need to examine the transition strength in the @xmath0-production .    in this subject",
    ", it has been believed for a long time that the momentum - dependence of the dirac fields is negligible in the low energy region , particularly below the fermi level .",
    "in fact , only very small momentum - dependence has appeared in the rhf calculation @xcite . in the high energy region , however , the vector - fields must become very small to explain the optical potential of the proton - nucleus elastic scattering @xcite , and the transverse flow in the heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "in addition this momentum - dependence also play an important role to explain the quasielastic electron scattering @xcite .",
    "even in low energy region , furthermore , the momentum dependence has been reported to plays important roles to explain the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance @xcite , the spatial convection current @xcite , nuclear structure @xcite ssand the pseudo - spin symmetry @xcite .",
    "in addition the dbhf approach also slightly change a saturation properties if the momentum dependence is introduced @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the energy - dependence of the dirac mean - field in the rhf approximation and show the antinucleon properties in off - mass - shell energy region .",

    "ii we explain structures of the nucleon propagator and self - energies in the rhf approach . in sec .",

    "furthermore , the on - mass - shell positive energy , @xmath35 , and the negative energy , @xmath36 , are defined as the pole energies of the propagator in eq.([propdn ] ) : @xmath37    we should here note the orthogonal relations between the dirac spinors .",

    "in this section we should give the detailed expressions of the momentum - dependent self - energies . in order to discuss these effects up to the @xmath0-threshold energies , we need to take into account many kinds of diagrams with multi - meson exchanges .",

    "<S> then we demonstrate that the antinucleon appearing in low energy observables is in the off - mass - shell energy region and that its properties are quite different from that at the on - mass - shell state . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we show that the quenched amount of the gt strength does not shift only to the @xmath0  production but also to the meson production through the imaginary part of the nucleon self - energy in the rhf approximation . </S>"
