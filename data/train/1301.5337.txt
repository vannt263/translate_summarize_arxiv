    "it is then possible to generate , for example , dicke states  @xcite , which were realized up to 6 photons , or bright squeezed entangled vacuum  @xcite , containing from few up to @xmath2 photons on average .",
    "probing quantum properties of these states is subtle  @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "their multi - photon nature puts them in a deeper conflict with local realistic description  @xcite . on the other , high pumping power fundamentally impairs their interference contrast  @xcite ( e.g. reduces the hong - ou - mandel dip  @xcite ) , making the observation of non - classical phenomena difficult .",

    "it is so far not known what is the exact threshold value for visibility for the multi - photon states to violate a bell inequality .",
    "what is known however , is that all non - classical effects , including violation of any bell inequality , require high visibility . in multi - photon pdc experiments visibility may be impaired by fundamental properties of the emission process ( production of additional pairs of photons ) and misalignment  @xcite .",
