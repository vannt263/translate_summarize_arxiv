    "plutonium - based materials have been extensively studied due to their interesting physical behaviors of the 5__f _ _ states and have always attracted particular attention because of their importance in nuclear fuel cycle @xcite .",
    "recently , experimental reports @xcite on the strategies of storage of pu - based waste illustrated that metallic plutonium surface easily oxidizes to pu@xmath0o@xmath2 and puo@xmath0 in surrounding of air and moisture .",
    "previous calculations @xcite using the hybrid density functional of ( heyd , scuseria , and enzerhof ) hse have established trends of the electronic properties of actinide dioxides ano@xmath0 ( an = th@xmath1es ) . along the series , mott insulators ( @xmath3@xmath4@xmath3 )",
    "are obtained prior to puo@xmath0 , whereas above amo@xmath0 , charge - transfer insulators ( o 2@xmath5an 5@xmath3 ) are observed .",
    "puo@xmath0 and amo@xmath0 lie in a crossover from localized to delocalized _ f _ electron character with increasing _ z_. they have strong 5@xmath3 - 2@xmath6 orbital energy degeneracy , which can lead to unexpected orbital mixing .",
    "recent theoretical work performed by petit _",
    "et al _ @xcite demonstrated that the dioxide is the most stable oxide for the actinides from np onward .",
    "all these works indicate that investigations of puo@xmath0 have particular meaning in actinide compounds .",
    "at ambient condition , puo@xmath0 crystallizes in a fluorite structure with space group _ fm@xmath7m_. and at 39 gpa , puo@xmath0 undergoes a phase transition to an orthorhombic structure of cotunnite type with space group _ pnma _ @xcite . in our previous work @xcite , we have systematically investigated the structural , electronic , mechanical , and optical properties of fluorite puo@xmath0 within the lda+__u _ _ and gga+__u _ _ formalisms . we found that comparing with the experimental data and the theoretical results , the accuracy of our atomic - structure prediction for antiferromagnetic ( afm ) puo@xmath0 is quite satisfactory by tuning the effective hubbard parameter _",
    "u _ in a range of 3 - 4 ev within the lda / gga+__u _ _ approaches .",
    "subsequently , jomard _ et al _ @xcite confirmed our results and further reported optical and thermodynamic properties of puo@xmath0 .",
    "in 2008 , yin and savrasov @xcite successfully obtained the phonon dispersions of both uo@xmath0 and puo@xmath0 by employing the lda+dmft scheme . in 2009 , minamoto _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the thermodynamic properties of puo@xmath0 based on their calculated phonon dispersion within the pure gga scheme .",
    "however , although many efforts have been performed on puo@xmath0 , little is known on its theoretical tensile strength @xcite .",
    "the ideal strength of materials is the stress that is required to force deformation or fracture at the elastic instability .",
    "although the strength of a real crystal can be changed by the existing cracks , dislocations , grain boundaries , and other microstructural features , its theoretical value can never be raised , i.e. , the theoretical strength sets an upper bound on the attainable stress . in this study , we focus our sight on the structural , electronic , mechanical , and magnetic features of puo@xmath0 under tension . the stress - strain relationships and the ideal tensile strengths are obtained by performing a first - principles computational tensile test ( fpctt ) @xcite . under tension , the bonding nature and electronic occupation characters are systematically studied .",
    "the first - principles density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations on the basis of the frozen - core projected augmented wave method of blchl @xcite are performed within the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite , where the lda @xcite is employed to describe electron exchange and correlation . for the plane - wave set , a cutoff energy of 500 ev is used .",
    "k_-point mesh in the full wedge of the brillouin zone ( bz ) is sampled by 9@xmath89@xmath99 grids according to the monkhorst - pack @xcite for the fluorite unit cell and all atoms are fully relaxed until the hellmann - feynman forces become less than 0.001 ev /  .",
    "the plutonium @xmath10 and the oxygen 2__s__@xmath112__p__@xmath12 electrons are treated as valence electrons .",
    "the strong on - site coulomb repulsion among the localized pu 5__f _ _ electrons is described by using the lda+__u _ _ formalism formulated by dudarev _ et al . _ @xcite . in this paper the coulomb energy ( @xmath13 ) and the exchange energy ( @xmath14 ) are set to be constants : @xmath13=4.75 ev and @xmath14=0.75 ev .",
    "these values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the same as those in our previous study of plutonium oxides @xcite . using these parameters",
    ", the lda+__u _ _ gives @xmath15=5.362  , which is very close to the experimental value of 5.398 @xcite . and",
    "our results reproduce all the features included in our previous work @xcite .",
    "in particular , we recover the main conclusion that although the pure lda fail to depict the electronic structure , especially the insulating nature and the occupied - state character of puo@xmath0 , by tuning the effective hubbard parameter in a reasonable range , the lda+__u _ _ approaches can prominently improve upon the pure lda calculations and , thus , can provide a satisfactory qualitative electronic structure description comparable with the photoemission experiments @xcite .",
    "spin - polarized calculations are performed and we find that the afm spin alignment is the most stable configuration among nonmagnetic , ferromagnetic ( fm ) , and afm configurations . the total - energy difference ( @xmath16 per formula unit at respective optimum geometries ) within the lda+__u _ _ is calculated to be 0.705 ev .    in the fpctt , the stress - strain relationship and the ideal tensile strength are calculated by deforming puo@xmath0 crystal to failure .",
    "the anisotropy of the tensile strength is tested by pulling the initial fluorite structure along the [ 001 ] , [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] , and [ 111 ] directions . as shown in fig .",
    "[ tensile1 ] , three geometric structures are constructed to investigate the tensile strengths in the four typical crystallographic directions : [ tensile1](a ) shows a general fluorite structure of puo@xmath0 with four pu and eight o atoms ; [ tensile1](b ) a body - centered tetrahedral ( bct ) unitcell with two pu and four o ; and [ tensile1](c ) a orthorhombic unitcell with six pu and twelve o. in fpctt , the tensile stress is calculated according to the nielsen - martin scheme @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the strain tensor ( @xmath19=1,2,3 ) and @xmath20 is the volume at the given tensile strain .",
    "tensile processes along the [ 001 ] , [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] , and [ 111 ] directions are implemented by increasing the lattice constants of these three orientations step by step . at each step ,",
    "the structure is fully relaxed until all other five stress components vanish except that in the tensile direction .",
    "or [ 100 ] , ( b ) [ 110 ] , and ( c ) [ 111 ] orientations . blue atoms are plutonium atoms while white atoms are oxygen atoms .",
    "the afm order is indicated by white arrows . ]    the calculated total energy , stress , and spin moments as functions of uniaxial tensile strain for afm puo@xmath0 in the [ 001 ] , [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] , and [ 111 ] directions are shown in fig .",
    "[ tensile2 ] .",
    "evolutions of the lattice parameters with strain in all four tensile processes are presented in fig .",
    "[ tensile3 ]",
    ". clearly , all four energy - strain curves increase with increasing tensile strain , but one can easily find the inflexions by performing differentiations .",
    "actually , at strains of 0.36 , 0.36 , 0.22 , and 0.18 , the stresses reach maxima of 81.2 , 80.5 , 28.3 , and 16.8 gpa for pulling in the [ 001 ] , [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] , and [ 111 ] directions , respectively .",
    "these results clearly indicate that the [ 001 ] direction is the strongest tensile direction and [ 111 ] the weakest .     in the [ 001 ] , [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] , and [ 111 ] directions .",
    "]     in the ( a ) [ 001 ] , ( b ) [ 100 ] , ( c ) [ 110 ] , and ( d ) [ 111 ] directions . ]    in fact , there are eight pu@xmath1o bonds per formula unit for fluorite puo@xmath0 .",
    "the angle of all eight bonds with respect to the pulling direction is 45@xmath21 in [ 001 ] direction . for pulling direction of [ 100 ] ,",
    "the bonding structure is same with that of [ 001 ] direction .",
    "so their pressure behaviors of total energy , stress , and spin moments are almost same before strain of 0.40 .",
    "the special behaviors of total energy , stress , and spin moments over @xmath22=0.40 for pulling in the [ 100 ] direction have tight relations with the abrupt behavior of its crystal structure .",
    "in fact , over @xmath22=0.40 the face - centered tetragonal ( fct ) structure will transit into an orthorhombic structure , as indicated by fig .",
    "[ tensile3](b ) .",
    "the lattice parameter of [ 001 ] direction is shortened and [ 010 ] direction elongated by tensile deformation . however , in [ 110 ] direction only four bonds make an angle of 45@xmath21 with the pulling direction . four other bonds are vertical to the pulling direction . in [ 111 ] direction ,",
    "two bonds are parallel to the pulling direction and six others make an angle of about 19.5@xmath21 with the pulling direction .",
    "it is easy to understand that the bonds vertical to the pulling direction have no contributions on the tensile strength and the bonds parallel to the pulling direction are easy to fracture under tensile deformation .",
    "therefore , the fact that the tensile strength along the [ 001 ] or [ 001 ] direction is stronger than that along [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] directions is understandable .",
    "besides , we note that the stress in [ 110 ] direction experiences an abrupt decrease process after strain up to 0.24 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the corresponding four pu@xmath1o bonds ( make an angle of 45@xmath21 with the pulling direction ) have been pulled to fracture .",
    "the fracture behaviors have been clarified by plotting valence electron charge density maps ( not shown ) . under the same strain , the abrupt increase of spin moment",
    "can be clearly seen [ fig .",
    "[ tensile2](c ) ] .",
    "while the spin moments in [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] directions only increase from 4.13 to 4.23 and 4.33 @xmath23 , respectively , the spin moments in [ 001 ] and [ 100 ] directions are increased up to about 5.27 and 5.11 @xmath23 , respectively , at the end of tensile deformation .",
    "in addition , the evolutions of the lattice parameters with strain in fig . [ tensile3 ] clearly show that along with the increase of the lattice parameter in the pulling direction , other two lattice parameters vertical to the pulling direction are decreased smoothly for tensile strains along [ 001 ] , [ 110 ] , and [ 111 ] directions . in [ 001 ]",
    "direction , the evolutions of the lattice parameters along [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions are absolutely same due to the structural symmetry .",
    "for all these three tensile deformations , no structural transition has been observed in our present fpctt study . the structural transition over @xmath22=0.40 for [ 001 ]",
    "direction tensile deformation is mainly due to the magnetic structure .       in ( 01@xmath24 )",
    "plane under strains of ( a ) 0.0 and ( b ) 0.5 along [ 001 ] direction tensile strain .",

    "o bonds in ( 01@xmath24 ) plane , ( b ) correlated minimum values of charge density along the bonds , and ( c)number of electrons transfer from each pu to o atom on the tensile strain along the [ 001 ] direction . ]    in order to investigate carefully the physical nature of puo@xmath0 under tension , in the following we systematically study the electronic structures of its afm phase within lda+__u _ _ formalism for pulling along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "the valence charge density maps under strains of 0.00 and 0.50 along [ 001 ] direction tensile deformation are plotted in fig .",
    "[ charge1 ] .",
    "clearly , the interatomic distances in the [ 011 ] direction are elongated and that in the [ 100 ] direction are shortened under tension . under strain of 0.50",
    ", fractures of the pu@xmath1o bonds can be seen . these results are understandable based on our foregoing statements for its pressure behaviors of total energy , stress , and lattice parameters . for explicitly indicating the ionic / covalent character of puo@xmath0 under tension , we further plot in fig .",
    "[ charge2 ] the evolutions of pu@xmath1o bond length in ( 01@xmath24 ) plane , correlated minimum values of charge density along the pu@xmath1o bond , and number of electrons transfer from each pu to o atom under tensile deformation along the [ 001 ] direction . the electron transfer analysis is performed according to the bader analysis @xcite and similar ionic / covalent character investigations for thorium dioxide and hydrides have been conducted in our previous works @xcite . obviously , as indicated by fig .",
    "[ charge2](a ) , the pu@xmath1o bond length in ( 01@xmath24 ) plane is elongated by tensile stress in [ 001 ] direction .",
    "the initial minimum value of charge density ( 0.53 @xmath26/@xmath25 ) along the pu@xmath1o bond , comparable to that along the np@xmath1o bonds included in our previous study of npo@xmath0 @xcite , is prominently larger than that along the th@xmath1o bonds ( 0.45 e / @xmath25 ) in tho@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the pu@xmath1o and np@xmath1o bonds have stronger covalency than the th@xmath1o bonds . under tension , this minimum value of charge density for pu@xmath1o bond decreases near linearly to 0.26 e / @xmath25 at the end of tensile deformation , which explicitly illustrates a decreasing behavior of covalent feature for pu@xmath1o bond .",
    "on the other hand , the number of electrons transfer from each pu to o atom under tensile deformation also decrease with strain .",
    "electrons of each atom are localized to their dominated region and thus reduces the ionicity for puo@xmath0 .",
    "overall speaking , the strong mixed ionic / covalent character of pu@xmath1o bond is weakened by tensile strain .     direction .",

    "figure [ dos](a ) shows the dependence of the insulating band gap @xmath27 on the tensile strain along the [ 001 ] direction and [ dos](b ) presents the total dos as well as the projected dos for the pu 5@xmath3 and o 2@xmath6 orbitals under strains up to 0.00 , 0.32 , and 0.50 .",
    "interestingly , the band gap varies smoothly under strain from 0.00 to 0.12 and then becomes to decrease near linearly from 1.66 ev to zero under strain of 0.12 to 0.32 .",
    "this explicitly indicates that along the [ 001 ] direction tensile deformation puo@xmath0 will occur an insulator - to - metal transition after tensile stress exceeds about 79 gpa .",
    "figure [ dos](b ) further illustrates this conclusion . the dos at strain of 0.50 shows that the electrons of pu and o atoms are separated from hybridization feature to exhibit one - atom character . and",
    "the main contribution for the metallic property is from both pu 5@xmath3 and o 2@xmath6 orbitals .",
