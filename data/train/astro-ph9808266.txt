    "cold gas is the ` living ' part of any galaxy , its bloodstream , so to speak .",
    "stars form from this gas and in turn eject processed material to the interstellar medium , a symbiotic process which dominates the evolution of spiral galaxies to the present day .",
    "twenty years ago , elliptical galaxies were thought to be simple systems , consisting of a single age stellar population formed in a single event at some long - ago epoch and passively evolving ever since ( tinsley & gunn 1976 ) .",
    "the puzzle of what had become of the gas shed by evolving stars ( faber & gallagher 1976 ) was though to be solved by the observation of large amounts ( @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) of hot ( @xmath2 to @xmath3 k ) gas in extended halos around elliptical galaxies by the einstein and , more recently , rosat and asca observatories ( e.g. canizares et al .",
    "1987 ) . however , as shown by several papers at this conference , for example , the observed gas accounts for only a small fraction of the expected total .",
    "hot gas does not directly support star formation .",
    "nevertheless , as the discussion at this conference shows , there is not yet a comfortable consensus on the origin of the hot gas , nor on the fate of the gas produced by stellar evolution , nor on the relationship between cold and hot gas in these systems .    even in 1976",
    ", it was known that some elliptical galaxies contain substantial amounts of cold interstellar gas , visible as dust lanes and patches : the paradigm galaxy is ngc 5128 , the powerful nearby radio galaxy centaurus a. however , since the morphological definition of elliptical galaxies includes `` smooth appearance '' with no discernible structure , such galaxies were classified as `` ep '' , `` so '' , `` sop '' , or `` i0 '' , where p = peculiar .",
    "galaxies like ngc 5128 were considered to be involved in a merger with a gas - rich spiral galaxy and to be highly atypical elliptical galaxies , or not elliptical galaxies at all .",
    "a lot has changed in the last 20 years , as the observational data at all wavelengths have improved dramatically .",
    "not only has it been found that the stellar populations and abundances in elliptical galaxies trace a varied and complex star formation history , but tracers of ongoing star formation and of many phases of the interstellar medium have been found in a large enough number of systems that these might be regarded as part of the ` typical ' elliptical galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , both current star formation activity and cold interstellar gas are present in much smaller amounts in elliptical galaxies and hence are much more difficult to distinguish against the galaxy s background - paradoxically , these phenomena are easier to measure in spiral galaxies because they dominate the radiation from the typical spiral galaxy at essentially all wavelengths .    h@xmath4 emission from warm photoionized gas is a reliable tracer of star formation activity in spiral galaxies , but in ellipticals is also produced by powerful agns and by photoionization by the old stars .",
    "hot ( @xmath5 k ) gas is produced by supernova shock heating in spiral galaxies and coexists intimately with the cold ism - but any such gas in elliptical galaxies is completely insignificant compared to the hot gas halos .",
    "diffuse weak radio continuum emission reliably traces star formation in the disks of spiral galaxies , but is insignificant compared to the powerful radio emission from agns , which are present in almost all elliptical galaxies . and finally , the spectroscopic and photometric signatures of recent star formation are hard to distinguish against the bright ambient stellar population .",
    "cold gas itself is more straightforward .",
    "hi , usually in very extended structures , has been mapped via its 21 cm emission from several tens of elliptical galaxies .",
    "molecular gas is detected in a surprisingly large fraction of elliptical galaxies via its emission in the co rotational lines ( and , in a few galaxies , via several other molecular probes ) .",
    "dust is detected in lanes in optical color images , via polarization and color gradients in the optical light ( wise & silva 1996 ) , and via emission at mid- and far - infrared and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "the most sensitive probe is probably fine structure emission from [ cii ] and [ oi ] ( malhotra et al .",
    "1998 ) . together , these observations show that elliptical galaxies , like spiral galaxies , contain an active cold interstellar medium .",
    "this review will discuss these probes of the interstellar medium in turn ; the amount , distribution and origin of the interstellar gas , and its relationship to the evolution of elliptical galaxies .",
    "it will not discuss the use of hi maps to measure the mass distributions of elliptical galaxies , and will mention only in passing cold ism at high redshifts and the ism in radio galaxies , two areas in which a lot of important and vital work has been done recently .",
    "this subject has really taken off in recent years , thanks to deep single - dish surveys ( huchtmeier 1994 , huchtmeier et al .",
    "1995 ) , and large scale mapping observations using the large southern and northern radio synthesis arrays , the australia telescope ( at ) and the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "the exciting work from the former telescope is described at this conference in papers by t. oosterloo and r. morganti .",
    "the general subject , as well as recent vla work , is discussed in recent reviews by schiminovich et al .",
    "( 1998a , b ) , van gorkom ( 1998 ) , and van gorkom & schiminovich ( 1998 ) .",
    ".hi detection rates in early - type galaxies .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     figure 1 shows the comparison between the molecular gas content of elliptical and spiral galaxies ; the co line flux s(co ) is plotted against the total blue magnitude @xmath6 .",
    "the co line flux is in rather arbitrary units : s(co ) = @xmath7 , where i(co ) is the integrated line intensity in @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the half - power beamwidth of the telescope used to make the observations .",
    "the comparison sample of spiral galaxies consists of the sb / sbc galaxies from the survey of elfhag et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , while the co data are from observations with the caltech submillimeter observatory by lees et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and knapp & rupen ( 1996 ) .",
    "the cso observations are made in the co(21 ) line with a half - power beamwidth of @xmath10 , and were made only at the central position of the galaxy .",
    "the elfhag et al .",
    "observations were made with beamwidths of @xmath11 or @xmath12 of the co(10 ) line , and again were made only at the central position of the galaxy .",
    "the use of the co(10 ) line for one sample and the co(21 ) line for the other should not pose too much of a problem , because in galactic molecular clouds , at least , the brightness temperatures of molecular clouds in the two lines are essentially equal .",
    "figure 1 shows that , on the average , the co fluxes are 20 - 30 times lower in elliptical galaxies than in spiral galaxies of the same total blue magnitude - elliptical galaxies contain a lot less dense cold gas .",
    "note also the large scatter in the co flux densities of the elliptical galaxies and the complete lack of correlation between the co flux and the blue light .",
    "many of the co observations have resulted only in upper limits on the co fluxes , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the values of the upper limits overlap completely with those of the detections ; statistical analysis of data sets with this sort of mix of detections and upper limits ( see lees et al .",
    "1991 , for example ) show that the upper limits are not restrictive : in other words , the data are consistent with all elliptical galaxies having weak co line emission and hence small amounts of molecular gas .",
    "figure 2 , where the co fluxes are plotted versus the 100@xmath13 fluxes for the same two samples of galaxies , tells a different story .",
    "although the beam used to observe the 100@xmath13 flux densities is large ( about @xmath14 ) and therefore observes most of the 100@xmath13 emission ( and further the 100@xmath13 data plotted in figure 2 include total flux densities for extended galaxies , taken from ned ) , the co and 100@xmath13 emission are fairly tightly correlated for the spiral galaxies , unlike the case with blue light ( figure 1 ) .",
    "figure 2 suggests a fairly well - mixed dense interstellar medium in these galaxies , with a roughly constant gas to dust ratio .",
    "the same data are also plotted for the sample of elliptical galaxies .",
    "although the scatter is much larger for these low signal - to - noise ratio observations , the measurements for the elliptical galaxies lie on the same relationship as found for spiral galaxies .",
    "the dotted line in figure 2 shows a relationship of slope 1 , i.e. @xmath15 . thus most of the 100@xmath13 flux in these systems is associated with the molecular interstellar medium , and the global characteristics of the dense ism are roughly the same in elliptical galaxies as they are in spiral galaxies .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath16 versus @xmath17 for nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "the x - ray emission is assumed to come from hot gas and the 100@xmath13 emission from cold dust ( although see below ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosities are from the einstein x - ray data compilation of fabbiano et al .",
    "( 1992 , fkt ) , and the 100@xmath13 data from knapp et al .",
    "the data plotted in figure 3 are for galaxies of morphological type e or e / s0 for which data are given in both catalogues and which are detected at either or both x - ray and infrared wavelengths .",
    "the x - ray emission can arise from the stellar component , from agns , and from hot gas .",
    "the stellar component was approximated by scaling x - ray to blue light flux for spiral galaxies , also using the data in fkt : @xmath18 ( cf .",
    "brown & bregman 1998 ) ( this includes a factor of 3 for the mass to light difference between the stellar populations of elliptical and spiral galaxies ) .",
    "if the ` stellar component ' is greater than or equal to the observed x - ray flux , it is taken as an upper limit to the x - ray flux - hence the horizontal line of x - ray upper limits in figure 3 .",
    "the infrared luminosities ( in @xmath19 ) are calculated from @xmath20 using the distances given by fkt .",
    "figure 3 shown no proportionality between the x - ray and infrared luminosities .",
    "the galaxies detected at both x - ray and infrared wavelengths show , if anything , anti - correlation between the fluxes .",
    "two galaxies are obvious exceptions to this , with x - ray detections and @xmath21 32.15 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "these galaxies , ngc 3258 and ngc 3894 , have agns , and it is likely that agn emission at significant or dominant levels is also present in some other galaxies plotted in figure 3 .    with the exception of the above two galaxies , those with relatively large values of @xmath17",
    "are not detected at x - ray wavelengths , while those with low values are .",
    "if the sample is divided at its median 100@xmath22 ratio , @xmath17 = 31.4 , the x - ray detection rate is 80@xmath2320% for galaxies with low infrared flux and 30@xmath2320% for galaxies with high infrared flux . despite probable contamination from agns , these data show that cold and hot gas are anti - correlated .",
    "a similar result is given by an exhaustive study of the interstellar gas and radio emission from both elliptical and s0 galaxies by eskridge et al .",
    "( 1995a , b ) .",
    "braine & wiklind ( 1993 ) and braine et al . (",
    "1997 ) find no co emission to very low limits for x - ray bright elliptical galaxies , both in and out of clusters , in contrast to the co detection rate in field elliptical galaxies discussed above .",
    "maps of the cold and hot ism in the bulge - dominated sa galaxy ngc 1291 by bregman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find that the cold gas is associated with the disk while the hot gas is associated with the bulge , while an analysis of the hot and cold gas contents of e , s0 and sa galaxies by roberts et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , bregman et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and hogg et al .",
    "( 1993 ) finds the same result .",
    "the anti - correlation between hot and cold gas found for elliptical galaxies ( which have no disks ) , however , suggests a more intimate relationship between the hot and cold gas in these systems ; the destruction of cold gas by hot interstellar gas , or the cooling of hot gas if enough cold gas is already present .",
    "dust is observed in optical images of galaxies because it absorbs and reddens the starlight .",
    "the presence of dust lanes and clouds in some elliptical galaxies has long been known ( hawarden et al . 1981 ; ebneter et al .",
    "1988 ) , and galaxies with prominent dust lanes tend to be hi rich ( morganti , this conference ) .",
    "systematic optical searches for dust in elliptical galaxies ( goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ; van dokkum & franx 1996 , df ) find dust lanes in the inner regions of a sizable fraction ( about 50% ) of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the analysis of hst archive data by df is particularly compelling because these elliptical galaxies were selected for observation to be as far as possible dust - free , since the object of the observations was the study of nuclear structure .    the two methods for finding dust clouds and measuring their mass , optical extinction and far - infrared emission , have both advantages and disadvantages .",
    "optical measurements can find small amounts ( @xmath24 ) of dust and can measure reddening and hence dust properties , but they are sensitive to geometry : edge - on disks are easy to see , face on disks are not ; and the dust can not be traced much beyond the bright inner ( within about @xmath25 ) regions . far infrared measurements are unaffected by geometry but have three disadvantages ; they are far less sensitive than are optical observations ; and since the emission is fairly weak , there are several sources of confusion , as discussed in section 3 , so that the measured dust masses are frequently unreliable .",
    "knapp et al . ( 1998b ) discuss and compare the optical and infrared observations of the df sample of elliptical galaxies , and find ( 1 ) dust is directly detected in about 80% of the galaxies , in good agreement with the df detection rate corrected for projection effects ; ( 2 ) the dust masses inferred from the far infrared measurements are almost always much higher than those measured by optical observations ( cf . figure 4 ; similar results are found by goudfrooij et al .",
    "1994 and by bregman et al .",
    "1998 ) ; and that the _ surface densities _ of dust measured at optical and infrared wavelengths are in remarkably good agreement ( figure 4 ) .",
    "( in these figures , ngc 2110 is a galaxy from df s sample which is not classified as an elliptical galaxy in any of the conventional catalogues , and is far dustier that any of the other galaxies in the sample ) .",
    "thus the ` typical ' elliptical galaxy appears to contain a small amount of interstellar dust , and by inference cold gas , but it should be noted that neither the optical nor the infrared observations are at all sensitive to dust at large distances from the center of the galaxy , and that many of these galaxies could contain far more interstellar dust than is seen by these observations .",
    "the question of whether the extended hi disks or rings seen around many elliptical galaxies contain dust or are primordial thus remains open .",
    "the high resolution optical data discussed by df were originally acquired to investigate core properties ( lauer et al . 1995 ) .",
    "these investigations show that elliptical galaxies fall into two classes - the more luminous have boxy isophotes and cores , while the lower luminosity galaxies have disky isophotes and no cores .",
    "interestingly , the incidence of detectable interstellar dust is essentially identical in these two types of galaxy .",
    "star formation is seen directly in the nearby dusty elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 . a small number of low luminosity elliptical galaxies ( e.g. ngc 855 , ngc 2328 , ngc 3928 , and ngc 5666 ) show many of the signs of star formation or even a starburst : blue colors , relatively high dust temperature , in some cases weak extended non - thermal radio emission , and hii - region like emission spectra . in terms of these tracers , the star formation seems to be behaving just as it does in the disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "the remarkable thing that elliptical galaxies have to contribute is the tiny amount of gas that seems to be required to support full - blown star formation .",
    "ngc 855 , for example , has @xmath26 of hi and only @xmath27 of @xmath28 , the amount found in one galactic giant molecular cloud ; yet it is cheerfully forming stars , as shown by its blue color and emission line spectrum .",
    "young ( this conference ) finds that the local group ellipticals ngc 205 and ngc 185 share this characteristic .",
    "thus star formation seems to be essentially a local process - all it takes is a few thousand @xmath29 of molecular gas .",
    "these star formation tracers , if they are present at all , are swamped by other sources of emission in most bright elliptical galaxies , as discussed in section 1 .",
    "it is nevertheless highly likely that many other elliptical galaxies support star formation at a low rate - the densities and column densities inferred from co and infrared observations are high in many cases .    a set of beautiful iso lws spectroscopic observations by malhotra et al .",
    "( 1998 ) finds [ cii ] and [ oi ] emission from several elliptical galaxies , showing the presence of at least several @xmath30 of gas in these galaxies . while these lines , especially the [ cii ] 158 @xmath13 line , are thought to be important or dominant coolants of the diffuse ism , iso and airborne observations of star forming regions show that much of the emission also arises from photo - dissociation regions , and the detection of these lines in elliptical galaxies probably demonstrates the presence of star formation at a low level .",
    "alas , iso is no more and there is no long - wavelength spectroscopic capability on sirtf , so it will be a long time before these lines can be probed again in early - type galaxies .",
    "the observations discussed in the previous sections strongly suggest that many elliptical galaxies have a small amount of cold interstellar gas , whose global properties ( admixture of gas and dust , molecular and atomic medium , etc . )",
    "are not dissimilar to the ism in spiral galaxies - there is just a lot less of it .",
    "this rather strongly suggests that the ` origin ' of the cold gas in elliptical galaxies is the same as that of spiral galaxies - to wit , the present - day gas content and its composition is the result of continuous evolution : initial star formation is incomplete , stars continue to form , gentle and violent mass loss from stellar evolution enriches the gas and injects dust , and the ism is partly replenished by mass loss , the infall of ( perhaps ) primordial gas and gas - containing companions .",
    "the ism , in other words , does not have a single origin any more than that in a spiral galaxy does - it has evolved along with the rest of the galaxy .",
    "this point of view suggests that elliptical galaxies have always contained a cold ism , and that its presence is not an anomaly .    among the more exciting developments in recent years",
    "is the plethora of data on the properties of very distant galaxies .",
    "many of these observations have shown that many elliptical galaxies had much more interstellar gas and star formation in the past than they do now .",
    "an investigation of the colors of gravitationally lensed quasars by malhotra et al .",
    "( 1997 ) shows that the lensed objects identified in radio surveys are systematically much redder , by several magnitudes in some cases , than are lensed objects identified in optical surveys , suggesting the presence of several magnitudes of extinction in a large fraction of lenses .",
    "most of the lenses are considered to be elliptical galaxies , as these systems have the mass and central density necessary to produce observable splittings .",
    "thus the typical elliptical galaxy at z @xmath31 0.5 often has a large amount of dust in its inner regions .",
    "a range of epochs for star formation may be inferred from color magnitude diagrams and other studies which find differences in the stellar populations among galaxies - for example , the recent study by pahre et al .",
    "( 1998 ) which shows that the slope of the elliptical galaxy sequence ( the fundamental plane ) depends on the photometric band in which the measurement is made , illustrating the difference in stellar content along the sequence .",
    "how are these results related to the present - day cold gas content of galaxies ?",
    "suppose that the star formation of a galaxy is simply proportional to the mass @xmath32 of cold interstellar matter .",
    "the rate at which the ism is consumed is then @xmath33 where f is the fraction of the gas used up per unit time ( @xmath34 is about 0.7 - 0.8 times the total star formation rate , because a fraction of the gas is returned by stellar evolution ) .",
    "if the initial mass of the galaxy is @xmath35 , then today ( @xmath36 ) @xmath37    the observations discussed above show that elliptical galaxies typically have @xmath38 .",
    "taking a typical stellar mass to blue light ratio for these galaxies of 3 @xmath39 gives a median present day value of @xmath40 of about 0.004 for an @xmath41 galaxy , corresponding to f = @xmath42 .",
    "the same calculation for a spiral galaxy gives f = @xmath43 .",
    "these numbers correspond to a present star formation rate of 1 - 3 @xmath44 in spiral galaxies and @xmath40 = 0.5 at z = 2 3 for an @xmath45 elliptical galaxy .",
    "elliptical galaxies are similar to spiral galaxies , in other words , in that they seem to have an evolving interstellar medium ; the difference is that the timescale for star formation is much shorter .",
    "franceschini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find indications that the star formation timescale is shorter for galaxies of larger mass .",
    "could the ` second parameter ' which determines the star formation rate be the velocity dispersion of the galaxy or galaxy subcomponent ?    thus the origin of the gas in elliptical galaxies may be no different from that in spiral galaxies , i.e. a combination of intrinsic gas , stellar mass loss and infall .",
    "this seems not to be the case for elliptical galaxies in clusters ; these galaxies contain a lot of hot gas but are almost devoid of cold gas .",
    "the fraction of ` peculiar ' elliptical galaxies in the revised shapley - ames catalogue ( sandage and tammann 1981 ) goes from about 5% in clusters to almost 50% in the field .",
    "perhaps the epithet ` peculiar ' has been attached to the wrong galaxies ; it looks as though galaxies in the field , both spirals and ellipticals , usually contain some coeval cold gas but that galaxies in clusters , both ellipticals and ( former ) spirals , do not .",
    "elliptical galaxies in clusters may be no more typical than are spiral galaxies in clusters .",
    "patricia carral , jordi cepa and their colleagues at the university of guanajuato put together a most educational and enjoyable meeting .",
    "i thank them for their invitation , and for their most generous support .",
    "i am greatly indebted to dave schiminovich , sangeeta malhotra , jacqueline van gorkom , michael rupen and pat udomprasert , who generously allowed me to use thier new results before publication .",
    "i also thank princeton university and nasa , via grant nag5 - 3364 , for support of this work , and nasa for its support of the nasa extragalactic data base ( ned ) .",
    "e. brinks i like your suggestion that one should consider the peculiar es in the field as being actually the normal e population and that the es in clusters have been stripped of their ism .",
    "but as es have quite a deep potential well , how can you strip them , and in such an efficient way ?",
    "r. bower the fraction of the baryons which are in stars in clusters of galaxies is only about 10% .",
    "so i agree with the suggestion by cen and ostriker that a similar fraction holds for the field galaxies .",
    "c. baugh the cen & ostriker argument inferring the global density of stars at z = 3 from observations of lyman - break galaxies is weak - the lyman - break galaxies sample only a small range of the full luminosity function at this redshift - a lot more star formation could be going on in smaller systems .",
    "also , corrections to the star formation rate for obscuration by dust could be as much as a factor of 2 - 5 .",

    "<S> elliptical galaxies outside dense clusters are observed to contain small amounts ( relative to spiral galaxies ) of cold interstellar gas . </S>",
    "<S> this review discusses the atomic gas , the molecular gas , and the dust in elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> field elliptical galaxies contain about 0.01 to 0.1 of the cold interstellar matter content of spiral galaxies of similar luminosity , and support a low level of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the surface densities of cold gas clouds in the centers of some elliptical galaxies are comparable to those in the densest regions of the galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> these observations suggest that elliptical galaxies in the field , like spiral galaxies , have a long - lived interstellar medium which evolves with the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the timescale for star formation , however , appears to be much shorter , leaving these systems with little gas at the present epoch . </S>"
