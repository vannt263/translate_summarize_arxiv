    "a knot is called _ hyperbolic _ if its complement admits a complete hyperbolic structure of finite volume .",
    "thereby a dehn surgery on a hyperbolic knot yielding a non - hyperbolic manifold is called _ exceptional_. in view of this , it is an interesting and challenging problem to determine and classify all exceptional surgeries on hyperbolic knots in the @xmath2-sphere @xmath3 .",
    "note that exceptional surgeries can be classified into the following three types ; a seifert fibered surgery , a toroidal surgery , a reducible surgery . here",

    "/ _ toroidal _",
    "/ _ reducible _ if it yields a seifert fibered / toroidal / reducible manifold respectively .",
    "this classification has been achieved as a consequence of the affirmative solution to the geometrization conjecture . here",
    "we note that currently less is known about a seifert fibered surgery compared with reducible or toroidal surgeries .",
    "see @xcite for a survey .    in this paper ,",
    "we give a sufficient condition for a strongly invertible knot in @xmath3 to admit no seifert fibered surgery ( proposition  [ cri : sfsquotient ] ) . to use this sufficient condition",
    ", we need to detect whether a given knot is a montesinos knot or not . for this problem",
    ", we give a new criterion for a knot to be a montesinos knot ( criterion  [ cri : monte ] ) , which is based on estimations of two concordance invariants , that is , the signature and the rasmussen invariant .",
    "this criterion is obtained from the fact that any montesinos knot is close to some alternating knot in the sense of the gordian distance .",
    "this would be interesting independently .",
    "as an application , we study seifert fibered surgeries on pretzel knots . a _ pretzel knot _ of type @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath5 , is defined as a knot admitting a diagram obtained by putting rational tangles of the form @xmath6 together in a circle . for basic terminologies in knot theory , we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite .    among all knots in @xmath3 , exceptional surgeries on pretzel knots have been studied extensively .",
    "( we summarize such results later . )",
    "one of the motivations to study dehn surgeries on pretzel knots is that many interesting examples about exceptional surgeries have been found among pretzel knots .",
    "for example , the first known examples of dehn surgeries on hyperbolic knots yielding lens spaces are those on @xmath7  @xcite , and the first example of a seifert fibered surgery on a non - strongly invertible knot is that on @xmath8  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", we have the following .    [ thm : inv ] a pretzel knot @xmath9 with integers @xmath10 admits no seifert fibered surgery .    note that the integer @xmath11 must be odd otherwise @xmath9 is not a knot but a link .",
    "[ rem : hyp - pretzel ] a pretzel knot @xmath9 with integers @xmath10 is known to be hyperbolic .",
    "actually it is already known which pretzel knots are non - hyperbolic .",

    "if the length @xmath14 of a pretzel knot is less than three , then it actually is a trivial knot or @xmath15 , which is non - hyperbolic .",
    "otherwise , non - trivial non - hyperbolic pretzel knots are just @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which are actually @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "this fact was shown by kawauchi  @xcite .",
    "oertel  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 5 ) independently showed the fact together with the result in the unpublished monograph by bonahon and siebenmann  @xcite .    in the following , as a background , we collect known facts on exceptional surgeries on pretzel knots .",
    "most of the following results concern a large class of knots , called montesinos knots .",
    "however , for simplicity , we only deal with pretzel knots .",
    "see the original references for the precise statements .    if the length @xmath14 of a pretzel knot is less than three , then it is non - hyperbolic as noted in remark  [ rem : hyp - pretzel ] . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown by wu  @xcite that a pretzel knot @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 admits no exceptional surgery .",
    "also wu showed that a hyperbolic pretzel knot admits no reducible surgery  @xcite , and gave a complete classification of toroidal surgeries on pretzel knots  @xcite .",
    "the authors also showed that there is no toroidal seifert fibered surgery on pretzel knots other than the trefoil knot  @xcite . among atoroidal seifert fibered surgeries on pretzel knots , dehn surgeries yielding @xmath2-manifolds with cyclic or finite fundamental groups were completely classified by the authors  @xcite and futer , ishikawa , kabaya , mattman , and shimokawa  @xcite independently .",
    "recently , wu  @xcite studied atoroidal seifert fibered surgeries in detail .",
    "in particular , he showed that if a hyperbolic pretzel knot that is not equivalent to a two - bridge knot admits an atoroidal seifert fibered surgery , then it is equivalent to @xmath23 with @xmath24 and , up to relabeling , @xmath25  ( * ? ? ? * theorem 7.2 ) .",
    "our theorem given in this paper shows that , among the families left open by wu , @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 have no seifert fibered surgeries .",
    "this is one of the motivations for focusing on the family @xmath9 with @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore the authors and kabaya  @xcite gave a complete classification of exceptional surgeries on @xmath29-pretzel knots with @xmath30 , in particular , it was shown that a @xmath31-pretzel knot with @xmath30 admits no seifert fibered surgery .",
    "consequently we see that if a hyperbolic pretzel knot admits an atoroidal seifert fibered surgery , then it is equivalent to    * @xmath32 with @xmath33 , * @xmath34 with @xmath35 , * @xmath36 with @xmath37 , * @xmath38 with @xmath39 , or * @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",

    "our methods presented in this paper may be applied to knots different from @xmath9 .",
    "one of the candidates would be a kind of double - torus knots .",
    "a key point to apply our techniques is that the knot can admit a particular kind of symmetry of period 2 .",
    "( a typical example of such a symmetry is depicted in figure  [ fig : axis1 ] for @xmath9 . )",
    "unfortunately it seems that the pretzel knots listed above do not have such a symmetry , and so , there is little chance that our techniques would work for the knots .",
    "in this section , we introduce a sufficient condition for a strongly invertible knot to admit no seifert fibered surgery .",
    "we also give a criterion for a knot to be a montesinos knot .",

    "then , the _ dehn surgery on @xmath43 along @xmath44 _ is defined as the following operation .",

    "we note that the following diagram commutes : @xmath190_{r\\text{-surgery } } \\ar[r]^{/f } \\ar@{}[dr]|\\circlearrowleft & s^3/f = s^3 \\ar@{>}[dr]^{r/2\\text{-surgery}}&~ \\\\ k(r ) \\ar[r]^{/\\bar{f } } & k(r)/\\bar{f } & \\hspace{-35pt } \\cong k'(r/2 ) } \\ ] ] since the base orbifold of @xmath50 is @xmath54 and @xmath50 has just three exceptional fibers , the configuration of cone points is either of the following :      thus @xmath192 is homeomorphic to either @xmath3 if the configuration is of type ( i ) or a lens space if the configuration is of type ( ii ) . if @xmath105 is a torus knot @xmath136 with @xmath30 , then @xmath193 is not homeomorphic to @xmath3  @xcite and thus ( i ) is not appropriate .",
