    "rare b meson decays , induced by flavor  changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath1 transition provide a promising testing ground in search of the effects beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the fcnc decays which are forbidden at tree level in the sm , appear at loop level and are very sensitive to the gauge structure of the sm .",
    "moreover , these decays are also quite sensitive to the present theories beyond the sm .",
    "as is well known , @xmath0 and @xmath2 decays are one  loop processes in the sm , governed by the @xmath3 transition , at quark level .",
    "because of their loop structures , these decays are suppressed and the relevant branching ratios in the sm are expected to be of the order of , roughly , @xmath4 for the @xmath5 decay , and @xmath6 for the @xmath2 decay , respectively @xcite@xcite . recently , belle @xcite and babar @xcite collaborations announced the following measurements of the branching ratio for the @xmath0 decay : ( b k ^+ ^- ) = \\ {    lc ( 4.8^+1.0_-0.9 0.3 0.1 ) 10 ^ -7 & @xcite  , +   + ( 0.65^+0.14_-0.13 0.04 ) 10 ^ -6 & @xcite  .    .",
    "one of the efficient ways in establishing new physics beyond the sm is the measurement of the lepton polarization @xcite@xcite .",
    "polarization of a single  lepton has been studied in the @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite@xcite , @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite decays .",
    "it has been pointed out in @xcite that , the study of the polarizations of both leptons provides many additional observables which can be measured , would be useful in testing the sm and looking new physics beyond the sm .",
    "polarization asymmetries and forward  backward asymmetry due to both leptons have been investigated in the @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite decays in the minimal supersymmetric model , respectively .    the goal of present work is studying various double  lepton polarizations in the exclusive @xmath0 decay using the most general form of the effective hamiltonian , including all possible forms of interactions . moreover , we study the correlation between double  lepton polarizations and single  lepton polarizations .",
    "our purpose in doing so is to find regions in the new wilson coefficients parameter space , in which the branching ratio and single ",
    "lepton polarization would agree with the sm prediction , while double ",
    "lepton polarizations would not .",
    "obviously , if such a region does exist , it is an indication of the fact that the new physics effects can be established by the measurement only of the double  lepton polarizations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , using the most general form of the effective hamiltonian , we obtain the matrix element of the @xmath0 decay in terms of form factors relevant to @xmath13 transition and then derive analytical results of double  lepton polarization asymmetries . in section 3",
    ", we numerically investigate the correlations of double  lepton asymmetries on branching ratio .",
    "moreover we analyze the correlation of double  lepton polarization observables to single  lepton polarizations .",
    "this section contains also discussion and our conclusion .",
    "in this section we calculate the double  lepton polarization asymmetries , using the most general , model independent form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath3 transition in terms of twelve model independent four  fermi interactions can be written in the following form : [ e6001 ] h_eff v_tsv_tb^\\ { c_sl |s i _ l b |^+ c_br |s i _ r b |^ + c_ll^tot |s_l _ b_l |_l ^_l + c_lr^tot |s_l _ b_l |_r ^_r + c_rl |s_r _ b_r    c_rr |s_r _ b_r |_r ^_r + c_lrlr",

    "several already exist in the sm .",
    "for example , the coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 in penguin operators correspond to @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the sm , respectively .",
    "the next four terms in eq .",
    "( [ e6001 ] ) are the vector type interactions with coefficients @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "two of these vector interactions containing @xmath22 and @xmath23 do exist in the sm as well in the form @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "therefore we can say that @xmath22 and @xmath23 describe the sum of the contributions from sm and the new physics and they can be written as c_ll^tot c_9^eff - c_10 + c_ll  , + c_lr^tot c_9^eff + c_10 + c_lr  , the terms with coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 describe the scalar type interactions .",

    "exclusive @xmath0 decay is described by the matrix element of effective hamiltonian over @xmath34 and @xmath35 meson states , which can be parametrized in terms of form factors .",

    "( [ e6001 ] ) that in order to calculate the amplitude of the @xmath0 decay , the following matrix elements are needed & & k|s _ b b  , + & & k |s i _ q^b b  , + & & k |s b b  , + & & k |s _ b b  .",

    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ e6006 ] ) that the difference from the sm is due to the last four terms only .",
    "namely , scalar and tensor type interactions . from the expression of the matrix element given in eq .",

    "we now proceed by calculating the double  polarization asymmetries , i.e. , when polarizations of both leptons are simultaneously measured .",

    "it is well known that the wilson coefficient @xmath66 receives long distance contribution coming from the real intermediate @xmath67 family . however , in the present work we consider only the short distance contribution .",
    "the modulo of @xmath68 is fixed by the experimental value of @xmath69 , while its sign is determined by the sm .",
    "in further analysis we use @xmath70 and for the parametrization of the form factors we use the results of the first reference in @xcite .",
    "the region for the new wilson coefficients can be obtained from existing experimental results of babar and belle collaboration on @xmath71 @xcite ( see figures below ) .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ e6013])([e6021 ] ) that double  lepton polarization asymmetries depend on @xmath72 and the new wilson coefficients .",
    "therefore , it may experimentally be difficult to study these dependencies at the same time .",
    "for this reason , we eliminate @xmath72 dependence by performing integration over @xmath72 in the allowed region , i.e. , we consider the averaged double  lepton polarization asymmetries .",

    "note that the region of the branching ratio is taken from the existing experimental result , and the corresponding regions of variation of the new wilson coefficients are given in the figures .    from these figures",
    "we deduce the following results :    *   there exist regions of new wilson coefficients where @xmath74 departs the sm result considerably when @xmath75 is very close to sm value .",
    "*   @xmath76 , as well as @xmath77 , seem to exceed the sm value 34 times , and they change their signs when new wilson coefficients vary in the allowed region and branching ratio is very close to the sm result .",
    "this behavior can serve as a good test for establishing new physics beyond the sm .",
    "*   in the presence of the new wilson coefficients , the value of @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) is 34 times smaller(larger ) compared to the sm prediction .",
    "moreover , @xmath79 changes its sign when new wilson coefficients vary .",
    "we do not not present the correlation of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 on the branching ratio , since the values of @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are very small , and the behavior of @xmath83 is quite similar to that of @xmath79 .",
    "change in the values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 is observed , but no change in their signs seems to occur .    in figs .",
    "( 5)(13 ) , we present the correlation of @xmath84 on branching ratio for the @xmath12 decay .",
    "similar to the @xmath85 decay , one concludes that several @xmath84 are sizable and sensitive to the existence of new physics .",
    "it should be noted that , in the present analysis we change the branching ratio in the region @xmath86 .",
    "next , we want to discuss the following problem",
    ". can we establish the new physics effects only by measuring the double  lepton polarization .",
    "in other words , do sizable regions of new wilson coefficients exist , for which the single  lepton polarization coincides with the sm result , while double ",

    ", we study the correlations of averaged double @xmath84 and single ",

    "our numerical analysis shows that , for the @xmath85 case , the correlations @xmath88 and @xmath89 are more informative .",
    "the correlations @xmath90 and @xmath91 are not suitable since their values in the sm are practically the same and if the new wilson coefficients are taken into account in the allowed region , the departure of @xmath74 and @xmath92 from their sm values is very small . in figs .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 15 ) we present the correlations of @xmath93 on @xmath94 and @xmath95 on @xmath96 , respectively . from these figures",

    "lepton polarizations coincide with the sm prediction . here in this figure and in rest of the following ones ,",
    "the numbers in the parentheses are the values of the branching ratio corresponding to the respective lower and upper values of the new wilson coefficients .",
    "the situation for the @xmath12 decay is slightly different .",
    "we obtain that the study of all correlations between double and single ",
    "lepton polarizations leads to strong restriction on tensor type wilson coefficient @xmath32 .",

    "finally , let us briefly discuss the problem of detectability of the lepton polarization asymmetries in experiments .",
    "experimentally , to measure an asymmetry @xmath84 of the decay with the branching ratio @xmath100 at @xmath101 level , the required relevant number of events ( i.e. , the number of @xmath102 pair ) are given by the expression n =  , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the efficiencies of the leptons .",

    "it should be noted here that the error in @xmath105lepton polarization is estimated to be about @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "so , the error in measurement of the @xmath105lepton asymmetries is of the order of @xmath109 , and the error in obtaining the number of events is about @xmath106 .",

    "+ .    on the other hand ,",
    "the number of @xmath102 pairs , that are produced at b  factories and lhc are about @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively . as a result of a comparison of these numbers and @xmath110 ,",
    "we conclude that , except @xmath116 in the @xmath85 decay and @xmath117 , @xmath118 in the @xmath12 decay , all double lepton polarizations can definitely be detectable at lhc .",
    "the numbers for the @xmath85 decay presented above demonstrate that , @xmath119 and @xmath120 for the @xmath121 decay should be accessible at @xmath34 factories after several years of running .    in summary , in this work , we present the most general analysis of the double  lepton polarization asymmetries in the @xmath0 decay using the most general , model independent form of the effective hamiltonian . in our analysis",
