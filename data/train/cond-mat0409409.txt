    "et al._,@xcite in the millimeterwave ( mw ) frequency range ( @xmath0 ghz ) and in a small magnetic field ( @xmath1  t ) , at low temperatures ( @xmath2 k ) a new type of oscillations arises in the magnetoresistance @xmath3 of a high - mobility 2des .",
    "these oscillations are periodic in @xmath4 and can occur in a @xmath5 weaker than the onset of shubinikov - de haas oscillations ( sdh ) .",
    "characteristically , their period is controlled by the ratio of the microwave frequency to the electron cyclotron frequency , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the effective mass of the conduction band electrons in gaas . in particular ,",
    "the oscillations can be associated with cyclotron resonance ( cr , @xmath9 ) and its harmonics ( @xmath10 ) . although the photoconductivity ( pc ) effect was well - known in the literature@xcite such findings came as a surprise .",
    "not only the observation of higher - order cr ( hence oscillations rather than a single peak ) , but also its large amplitude , was completely unexpected .",
    "moreover , later it was found that in samples of even higher mobility , the oscillation minima approach zero .",
    "recently , mani _",
    "et al._@xcite and zudov _",
    "et al._@xcite reported the observation of new `` zero - resistance states '' ( zrs ) associated with such minima in very clean samples . at low temperatures , zrs are characterized by an exponentially vanishing diagonal resistance and an essentially classical hall resistance .",
    "such a new effect in a 2des induced by microwaves is a subject of much current experimental@xcite and theoretical work.@xcite some of the theoretical ideas can be traced back to earlier studies of negative photoconductivity phenomena in semiconductors.@xcite these models , as well as others , remain to be tested experimentally .",
    "the observation of zrs is complemented by an observation of zero - conductance states under similar experimental conditions , but in corbino samples.@xcite",
    "photoconductivity related to cr of a 2des was first reported by maan _",

    "distinct magnetoresistance signals due to electron spin resonance ( dobers _ et al._@xcite ) or magnetoplasmon resonance ( vasiliaou _ et al._@xcite ) were observed in 2des in gaas - algaas heterostructures . in these earlier studies using samples of electron mobility @xmath11 @xmath12/vs or less",
    ", the pc signal exhibits a single peak in the @xmath3 , and its amplitude is typically less than 1% .",
    "the mw - induced giant amplitude magnetorsistance oscillations were discovered@xcite using a high - mobility ( @xmath13 @xmath12/vs ) 2des . in a small magnetic field",
    "the @xmath3 shows periodic ( in @xmath4 ) oscillations , with the @xmath5 positions of major maxima and minima in the oscillatory structure roughly conforming to@xcite @xmath14 phenomenologically such oscillations resemble sdh oscillations except that their period relates to @xmath15 rather than to @xmath16 , the landau level filling factor .",
    "most remarkably , the @xmath3 at the minima was found to reduce from its dark value , indicating of negative pc .",
    "this was a crucial step leading to the discovery of zrs ; increasing sample mobility favors oscillation amplitude , and , therefore , the @xmath3 value at the minima becomes progressively smaller under similar experimental conditions .",

    "for example , the first zrs spans from @xmath30 to @xmath31 and similar width of @xmath32 is observed for other zrs minima in this sample .",
    "these data indicate that the transport under mws is controlled by @xmath15 rather than by @xmath16 . while the @xmath3 here remarkably resembles that in qhe , the hall resistance , @xmath29 , shows no sign of forming plateaus . in the very - high mobility 2des ,",
    "the major peaks of mw - induced oscillations ( which are relevant to zrs regime ) can still be well described by eq . 1 for @xmath33 , but their shapes are largely asymmetric .",
    "higher - order peaks are better described by a @xmath5-dependent phase shift with respect to cr harmonics ( @xmath34 ) , which saturates at @xmath35.@xcite     peaks and zrs minima , showing a roughly linear dependence of the peak values on inverse temperature , and a thermally activated resistance at the minima .",

    "the @xmath4 oscillations are shown in fig .  3 for different temperatures but under the same mw irradiation .",

    "all four minima conform to a general expression , @xmath39 , over at least one decade in the @xmath3 .",
    "unusually large @xmath40 is found for these minima .",
    "for example , @xmath41 k for the first minimum , exceeds both the mw photon energy ( @xmath42 k ) and the landau level spacing ( @xmath43 k ) by about an order of magnitude . as also shown in fig .",

    "we have observed zero - conductance states ( zcs ) under similar experimental conditions.@xcite typical data from a high mobility ( @xmath44 @xmath12/vs ) 2deg corbino ring are shown in fig .",
    "temperature dependence , as well as i  v measurements at zcs , shows that 2des behaves like a macroscopic insulator in this regime.@xcite",
    "remarkably , we have observed a series of new zrs associated with fractional @xmath15 , such as     and @xmath45 ; the associated minima develop into zrs as the microwave power is increased ( attenuation of the microwave power is marked next to the @xmath3 traces ) .",

    "figure  5 shows the development of such zrs with increasing mw power @xmath49 .",
    "at all @xmath49 values the previously reported `` integer '' zrs are observed . beyond the @xmath50 peak ,",
    "a @xmath51 peak and associated minimum ( around @xmath52 t ) are already visible at lower power ( attenuation @xmath53  db ) . with increasing @xmath49 , this minimum develops into a new wide zrs .",
    "the @xmath46 structure has first been noticed in ref .   and can also be seen in fig .  1 ; the feature becomes stronger in samples with higher mobility.@xcite dorozhkin@xcite and willett _",
    "et al._@xcite have also reported features associated with @xmath54 . in this experiment",
    "we also observe fractional zrs forming about @xmath45 .",
    "another important observation is the ( overall ) suppression of the @xmath3 at @xmath55 .        from the @xmath5 position we interpret these new zrs as resulting from two - photon processes , where two photons of frequency @xmath56 participate in the transition between landau levels separated by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively@xcite .",
    "this observation may suggest the importance of virtual processes in the microwave - induced oscillations and zrs .    in the higher frequency region ( @xmath59 ghz ) , we observed a strong modulation of sdh oscillations by the presence of mw .",
    "this phenomenon has been reported in ref .   for samples of a moderately - high mobility . the data in fig .",
    "6 shows similar results from an ultra - clean 2des .",
    "in addition to the first node , higher - order nodes were observed in this sample .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the photoconductivity oscillations and zrs in a high - mobility 2d hole system ( 2dhs ) primarily for the following reasons : 1 ) comparing with 2d electron system , 2dhs has different band structure parameters such as larger effective mass and significant nonparabolicity of the dispersion ; 2 ) 2dhs possesses strong spin - orbit interactions . our preliminary result for a 2dhs",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the 2dhs is from a ( 001 ) gaas / al@xmath60ga@xmath61as qw grown by mbe .",
    "the qw has a well width of 15 nm ; holes are provided by a c delta - doping layer situated 50 nm away from the well .",
    "a 100-@xmath62m - wide hall bar , on which measurements were performed , is defined by lithography and is contacted by in / zn alloy .     under microwave irradiation .",
    ", width=377 ]    to simultaneously detect photoresistivity , @xmath63 , and resistivity , @xmath64 , a double - modulation technique was employed .",
    "the main feature of @xmath65 , as shown for mw frequency of 26.5 ghz , is a positive peak at @xmath66 kg and a negative valley ( a suppression of @xmath64 ) around @xmath67 kg , both having relatively small magnitude .",
    "the 2.5 kg peak could be associated with the cr of the 2d holes which have an effective mass @xmath68 ( measured in separate transmission experiments in a similar @xmath5 range ; for measurement techniques , see ref .  ) .",
    "the nature of the 6 kg valley is not yet clear .    from the mobility of the holes , @xmath69 @xmath12/vs and a mass value of 0.3  m@xmath70",
    ", we estimate a transport scattering time of @xmath71 ps .",
    "this value is a factor of two smaller than that of the 2des ( where @xmath72 ps ) in which the giant amplitude oscillations were originally observed,@xcite a fact that may be considered in explaining the lack of oscillations in this 2dhs .",
    "however , the band structure of holes must be taken into account to understand these data .",
    "oscillatory and vanishing magnetoresistance can be induced by millimeterwave irradiation in high mobility two - dimensional electronic systems traditionally used for studies of the quantum hall effect . depending on the sample geometry , zero resistance states ( in hall samples ) or zero conductance states ( in corbino samples ) are observed .",
    "some new aspects of the observations are reported here which may help to distinguish between competing theoretical models of the phenomenon .        ,",
