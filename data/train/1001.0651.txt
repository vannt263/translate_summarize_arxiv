    "s3 presents the temperature profile of the outer tube for the system ( 10,10)@(15,15 ) for different times after a thermal gradient of 7 k / nm is imposed between the two extremities of the outer tube . as we can see an approximately linear variation of the temperature with @xmath4",
    "is attained after about 50 ps , the period @xmath44 of @xmath20 should be larger than 100 ps in order to keep the cnt oscillator operating in the constant thermal gradient regime .",
    "as mentioned in the main text the behavior of the thermophoretically driven cnt oscillator depends upon both the inner tube length and the thermal gradient . in order to evaluate this dependence",
    ", we identified the cases where there is an oscillation ( regular or chaotic ) of the inner tube .",
    "in such cases the motion is limited within the outer tube . on the other hand , for some set of parameters ,",
    "the inner tube was strongly accelerated and ejected off the outer tube .",
    "the evolution of the inner tube position was obtained by numerical integration of eq .",
    "( 1 ) for different values of the thermal gradient and driving period @xmath44 .",
    "these results are only estimations since we used parameters for the case of inner tube length of 5 nm and thermal gradient of 7 k / nm ( @xmath53 nn , @xmath54 pn ps@xmath17/@xmath17 , and @xmath55 pn nm / k ) to all other thermal gradient cases .",
    "figure s4 shows a phase diagram which indicates , for which combinations of the driving period and the thermal gradient @xmath52 , the inner tube motion is limited .",
    "as one can see , the phase diagram exhibits a complicated structure .",
    "the longer the inner tube , the higher the thermal gradient necessary to completely eject the inner tube .",
    "the overall behavior of the oscillator will also depend upon the outer tube length .",
    "the inner tube can reach a steady velocity state if the outer tube is long enough .",
    "for example , for the thermal gradient of 7 k / nm and an inner tube length of 5 nm , steady velocity state was observed for an outer tube length of 1 @xmath28 m , as shown in figure s5 . for this case ,",
    "the behavior of the device will be different as represented in the bifurcation diagram of figure s6 .",
    "the inner tube can now perform periodic motions only at one side of the outer tube .",
    "this is because the inner tube is not able to return to the middle of the outer tube for such large outer tube length .",
    "furthermore , such large outer tube lengths may cause additional issues such as off - axis vibrations ( if not clamped ) which may make the device not viable . modifying the thermal pulse ( form , periods , etc )",
    "might provide a way to allow periodic motions covering all long outer tubes .                for low thermal gradients ( below @xmath27 1 k / nm ) ,",
    "steady velocity state is expected to be achieved for even longer outer tubes . by reducing the temperature ,",
    "a decreased in the friction is expected since nanotube vibrations ( one of the causes of energy dissipation ) are reduced .",
    "this is indeed observed in the @xmath9 values of the fitted parameters for the cases of 7 and 17 k / nm .",
    "thus , we expect a decreasing of the @xmath9 value for lower thermal gradients than 7 k / nm .    since we have not performed molecular dynamics simulations for low thermal gradients ( below 1 k / nm ) , which provide the necessary parameters for eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we can only estimate the behavior for such cases .",
    "the estimation is done by numerically integration eq .",
    "( 1 ) for different parameters of @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath51 will not change since we are not changing the double - walled carbon nanotube considered .    keeping the same @xmath11 value of the 7 k / nm case and using @xmath56 0.5 pn ps@xmath17/@xmath17",
    ", we can see in figure s7 that the steady velocity state will be achieved for even longer outer tubes for a thermal gradient of 0.1 k / nm .",
    "thus , the value of 1 @xmath28 m for the outer tube length can be considered as a lower limit where stead velocity state is expected , for thermal gradients below @xmath27 10 k / nm ."

    "<S> the inner tube length significantly affects the bifurcation diagrams and , consequently , the necessary driven periods for regular motions . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal gradient greatly influences the overall behavior of the cnt oscillator since , for relatively high values of @xmath10 , the acceleration of the inner tube can be so high that it could be ejected , destroying the nanodevice . for long outer tubes ( @xmath27 1 @xmath28 m ) , the inner tube can reach a steady velocity state which can change the system dynamics , not allowing periodic motions that cover all the outer tube ( fig .  4  ( b ) ) @xcite . from the practical point of view </S>",
    "<S> , very long outer tubes will be strongly influenced by off - axis tube oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary md simulations of models for the nanodevice shown in fig .  1 indicated high amplitude off - axis oscillations of the outer tube when its extremities are not clamped . on the other hand , clamped extremities ( e.g. , achieved by the use of additional cnt junctions along the outer tube ) </S>",
    "<S> can prevent such vibrations and increase the stability of the nanodevice proposed here .    in summary , based on numerical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations we demonstrated that the use of thermal gradients can be an effective approach to initialize , control , and tune cnt - based oscillators . </S>",
