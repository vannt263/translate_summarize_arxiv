    "@xcite , we found @xmath68 for the signal against @xmath69 for the total background for a @xmath62 higgs boson mass . based on these rates a @xmath59 significance observation is possible with @xmath70 of integrated luminosity for a @xmath71 higgs dark matter particle .",
    "the table  [ tab : results ] summarizes our results .",
    "the impact of the @xmath57 cut  ( [ eq : cutphi ] ) on the double higgs production is fairly the same as the single higgs process representing a dilution factor of @xmath72 in our case and @xmath73 in the single higgs case .",
    "the backgrounds on their turn are suppressed by a factor of @xmath74 which motivates the cut in the single higgs case after all .",
    "the impact of this cut on the required luminosity is mild though increasing from @xmath75 to @xmath76 the required integrated luminosity for a @xmath59 observation of a @xmath62 higgs .",
    "it indicates that there is still some room for an optimum choice of cuts for example tightening the missing @xmath77 or the jets invariant mass cut . on the other hand a complete simulation taking into account hadronization , pile - up effects and more realistic detector efficiencies",
    "is necessary in order to evaluate the lhc potential more precisely .",
    "an interesting question arisen looking at the @xmath57 distribution of figure  ( [ fig : phijj ] ) is how to discriminate between a higgs dark matter of the classes of models under consideration and a single higgs decaying to an invisible final state with a large branching ratio as considered in ref .",
    "it is evident it can not be done based on the kinematic distributions of the jets .",
    "observing signals associated to a single invisible higgs boson production in other channels would be important for that task once we do not expect seeing signals for the classes of models we considering here based on our results and on the results from ref .",
    "@xcite as well .",
    "another possibility is to find a way to measure the growth in the total cross section as a function of the center - of - mass energy of the collision .",
    "the weak boson fusion is the best suited process to that goal , however it can not be done easily at hadron colliders without relying on the decay products of the higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "a future linear collider could do that job in the wbf channel once the energy of the incoming leptons can be tunned .",
    "it s worth mentioning that dark matter production in weak boson fusion is not likely to occur at hadron colliders in the framework of models presenting cdm candidates like the mssm or ued for example . in the mssm case",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that destructive interference between wbf - type diagrams and bremsstrahlung diagrams contributing to the lightest neutralino production decreases the rates to an attobarn level for @xmath78 at the lhc .",
    "on the other hand in the ued models the lightest kk particle is an almost pure @xmath79 gauge boson which strongly suppresses the couplings to other gauge bosons and probably depletes the wbf channel as well .",
    "in the @xmath0 gauge - higgs unification model in the randall - sundrum spacetime proposed in ref .  @xcite the 4d higgs field becomes a part of the fifth - dimensional component of the gauge fields .",
    "electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically through loop corrections to the higgs potential and the conservation of an additional quantum number called _ h - parity _ renders absolute stability to the higgs boson which becomes a natural cold dark matter candidate . as a consequence of vanishing of all triple couplings to the standard model spectrum by virtue of _ h - parity _ conservation , the higgs boson can only be produced in pairs through quartic couplings to massive gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "the mass of such a higgs dark matter is constrained from recent astrophysical data to lie in the @xmath1-@xmath2 mass range .    in this paper",
    "we show that the @xmath13 lhc has the potential to discover such a higgs dark matter particle of @xmath62 mass with 237(239 ) @xmath3 of integrated luminosity for a @xmath59 observation in the weak boson fusion channel following the same search strategy used in the single invisibly decaying higgs case of ref .  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the cut on the azimuthal angle between the tagging jets were found to be less effective from the point of view of reducing the amount of data necessary for discovery compared to the single higgs case which demonstrates that there is still room for optimization of the search strategy .    as a final comment ,",
    "the enhanced production cross section compared to the sm case is due the lack of cancellations between the triple and quartic contributions .",
    "this feature may help to establish the model if the growth in the production cross section as a function of the center - of - mass energy could be determined for example in a future linear collider or using dedicated methods to that aim as for example was proposed in  @xcite .",
