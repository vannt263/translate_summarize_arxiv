    "geminga ( psrj0633 + 1746 ) is a nearby radio - quiet pulsar , discovered as a gamma - ray source and later identified as a neutron star ( ns ) through optical and x - ray observations ( see @xcite for review ) . the pulsar period ( @xmath6237 ms ) and its derivative ( @xmath7@xmath8 s s@xmath5 ) correspond and @xmath9 from @xmath10 and @xmath11 . ] to a spin - down age @xmath12340 kyr , a spin - down power @xmath13 erg s@xmath5 and a surface magnetic field @xmath14 g. _ hubble space telescope _",
    "parallax measurements confirmed the proximity of geminga ( @xmath15 pc ) and a proper motion corresponding to a transverse velocity of @xmath1210 km s@xmath5 @xcite , exceeding the typical sound speed in the interstellar medium ( 1030 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "together with crab and vela , geminga is one of known pulsars with the highest spin - down flux ( @xmath16 ) , allowing detailed studies of weak structures in the immediate vicinity of the ns and its interactions with the local interstellar medium .",
    "pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) are common diffuse features surrounding nss with very different spin - down ages , that result from the interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind and the ambient medium , producing shocks and outflows that can be observed , mostly because of synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) radiation , in a very broad range from radio to gamma - ray energies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the complex pwn structures mostly depend on the particular wind outflow geometry and on the ratio of the pulsar speed to the sound speed in the ambient medium @xcite .",
    "well - resolved equatorial  tori \" and axial ( with respect to the spin axis )  jets \" are seen around pulsars moving in the interstellar medium with subsonic velocities ( e.g. crab and vela pulsars ; @xcite ) , while in pulsar moving with supersonic speed , as is the case of geminga , bow - like shapes ahead of the pulsar and tails behind are typically observed @xcite .",
    "in fact , _ xmm - newton _ observations of geminga in april 2002 revealed two @xmath12@xmath17-long tails behind the pulsar , approximately symmetric with respect to the sky projection of the pulsar s trajectory @xcite .",
    "geminga was then observed by _",
    "chandra _ in february 2004 unveiling a new structure @xmath125@xmath18-long and @xmath15@xmath18-thick , with a surface brightness @xmath140 times higher than that of the _ xmm - newton _ tails , starting at the pulsar position and aligned with the proper motion direction @xcite .",
    "a faint arc - like structure was also reported 57 arcsec ahead of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "a deeper _ chandra _ observation carried out in august 2007 confirmed the existence of the axial tail ( 50@xmath18-long ) and of the two outer tails discovered by _ xmm - newton _ @xcite providing an overall x - ray pwn luminosity of @xmath19 erg s@xmath5 ( @xmath20@xmath21 ) . comparing 2004 and 2007 _ chandra _ observations , @xcite found indication that the x - ray tail is composed of variable @xmath15@xmath18-long sub - structures ( streaming  blobs \" ) .",
    "this complex morphology was interpreted as synchrotron radiation possibly arising from the shocked pulsar wind collimated by the ram pressure and/or jets emanating along the pulsar s spin axis .",
    "apart from diffuse tev emission around geminga on larger scales ( @xmath22@xmath23 ) with respect to the x - ray nebula @xcite and a possible detection in the mid - infrared @xcite , the geminga pwn has not been detected in other energy bands so far . in particular , since the discovery of geminga as a gamma - ray source , many observers have attempted to detect it at radio frequencies , both as a continuum and as a pulsating source , providing only tentative detections of weak pulsed emission at low frequencies ( @xmath1100 mhz ; see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported upper limits on the continuum emission ( very large array [ vla ] data ) at 74 mhz ( @xmath2456 mjy ) and 326 mhz ( @xmath245 mjy ) reconciling their nondetection with previous pulsed detections by invoking intrinsic or extrinsic ( refractive interstellar scintillation ) variability . at higher frequencies , @xcite reported an upper limit of 0.5 mjy at 21 cm ( westerbork synthesis radio telescope data ) and 1 mjy at 6 cm ( vla data ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented a high - resolution ( 24@xmath18 ) study of the hi interstellar gas distribution around geminga including a 1.4 ghz upper limit of @xmath10.4 mjy in the pulsar direction . here",
    "we present the results of the deepest vla interferometric observation of geminga performed so far .",
    "geminga was observed at 4.8 ghz ( 6 cm ) , with a bandwidth of 50 mhz with the vla in d configuration ( program ap468 ) .",
    "the observation was performed on 2004 july 24 for a total of 6.0 on - source hours , with the antennas pointed at @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "calibration and imaging were performed with the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software package .",
    "the flux - density scale was calibrated by observing 0137 + 331 ( 3c48 ) .",
    "the source 0625 + 146 was observed at intervals of 30 minutes and used as phase calibrator .",
    "the surface brightness image was produced following the standard procedures : fourier - transform , clean , and restore implemented in the aips task imagr .",
    "we averaged the 2 ifs together in the gridding process under imagr .",
    "self - calibration was applied to remove residual phase variations .    in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] we show a @xmath18@xmath17-side field of the radio continuum emission around geminga .",
    "the image has a fwhm beam of @xmath27 ( position angle , @xmath28 ) and a noise level of 25 @xmath29jy beam@xmath5 ( 1@xmath0 ) .",
    "a radio feature , with a peak of brightness at @xmath2210@xmath0 significance level , located at @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( through aips task jmfit ) , has been detected .",
    "the absolute astrometric accuracy of vla observations is linked to the uncertainty in the phase calibrator position , which is better than @xmath32 in our case .",
    "however , the vla accuracy can be limited by a number of effects , such as the atmospheric phase stability .",
    "for this reason , we adopted for the positioning uncertainty a more conservative figure of @xmath33 , which was estimated as the synthesised beam size divided by the signal to noise ratio ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed brightness distribution is more extended than that expected for a point source : it is slightly elongated and fits with a single 2-dimensional gaussian model with a fwhm major axis of @xmath34 , a minor axis of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , incompatible with beam parameters ( the fit with the point - spread function yields a poor reduced @xmath37 of @xmath12.5 for 5 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the deconvolved size along the major axis ( approximately the direction of geminga proper motion ) is @xmath38 , while it is unresolved in the transverse direction .",
    "the flux density of the source at 4.8 ghz is @xmath39 mjy being calculated by integrating the total intensity surface brightness down to the noise level .",
    "no evidence of source variability was found down to @xmath11.52 hours , which is the minimum time - scale that can be probed in our data . at the distance of geminga ,",
    "the corresponding radio power is @xmath40 w hz@xmath5 .    to investigate the presence of such source in other vla observations",
    ", we analyzed an archival dataset at 1.5 ghz in b configuration ( program ak147 ) . in this case",
    "we obtained an image with a fwhm beam of @xmath41 and noise level of 22 @xmath29jy beam@xmath5 ( 1@xmath0 ) .",
    "we did not found any source in correspondence to the 4.8 ghz detection .",
    "@xcite reported on a study of the hi ( 21-cm line ) interstellar gas distribution on a @xmath42 field around geminga based on vla and effelsberg radio telescope data .",
    "based on the line - free channels of the 1.4 ghz cube , they produced a radio continuum image with 24  angular resolution , confirming the nondetection of any source at this frequency , either point - like or extended , down to a noise level of 0.14 mjy beam@xmath5 ( 1@xmath0 ) .",
    "hence , the presently available data do not allow one to constrain the thermal or non - thermal nature of the emission , but , if the radio source is steady , we can set an upper limit on the spectral index , where @xmath43 is the spectral index .",

    "we note however that if the radio source is variable , this limit is unreliable , since the reported observations are not simultaneous .",
    "we computed the coordinates of the geminga pulsar at the epoch of the reported vla observation by projecting the accurate optical absolute position by @xcite using the proper motion measurement by @xcite : @xmath46 , @xmath47 with errors @xmath2401 .",

    "the data were processed using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observation software ( ciao , version 4.2 ) and we employed the caldb 4.3 calibration files .",
    "standard screening criteria were applied to generate a 0.58 kev image of the field of geminga . using the _ chandra _ aspect tool , we found a small offset in the astrometry ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) . after fixing the offset , in order to assess the absolute astrometry of the _ chandra _ data set , we computed the position of geminga with the wavedetect task .",

    "a vla observation at 4.8 ghz unveiled a @xmath1@xmath2-long radio feature with flux of @xmath10.4 mjy associated with the geminga pulsar and its pwn . significant contamination from geminga persistent pulsed radio emission",
    "is very unlikely : given the tight upper limits on pulsed flux density at low frequency ( e.g. @xmath52.05 mjy at 0.4 ghz ; @xcite ) , the contribution of pulsed emission to the total observed flux at 4.8 ghz would be @xmath240.1% for the mean spectral index of radio pulsars ( @xmath24@xmath43@xmath53 ; @xcite ) and could at most reach @xmath115% even in the extreme case of a flat spectrum . the occurrence of transient pulsed ( or continuum ) radio emission in isolated nss in not unheard - of , but it involves at our present knowledge pulsar classes showing a totally different phenomenology from that of the geminga pulsar , like magnetars and rotating radio transients @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the emission models mentioned above , as well as any other kinds of magnetospheric emission originating very close to the ns surface ( and hence appearing as point - like at the spatial resolution of the available observations ) , are disfavored by the evidence for a slightly elongated feature , together with the occurrence of a marginal offset between the ns position and the radio emission centroid ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the latter two features and the tendency of the radio emission to distribute along the direction of the axial x - ray tail , naturally lead to an association with the geminga pwn .",
    "* and references therein ) observed that the axial tail may result from the shocked pulsar wind collimated by the ram pressure ( i.e. a bow - shock ) or from a jet emanating along the pulsar s spin axis and perhaps aligned with the direction of motion . in the frame of the standard bow - shock models ,",
    "radio pwne are generally interpreted as arising from cooling of x - ray - emitting leptons @xcite .",
    "the smaller size of the radio nebula of geminga ( with respect to the whole , time - integrated , @xmath150  long x - ray tail ) apparently contradicts this hypothesis , unless we associate the observed radio feature to the variable streaming ` blobs ' of @xmath15  diameter , possibly constituting the x - ray axial tail as observed in 2004 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , synchrotron models explaining the x - ray tails as pulsar wind shocked by the ram pressure due to the ns s supersonic motion typically require relatively low magnetic fields ( @xmath110100 @xmath29 g ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . with such low magnetic fields",
    ", the radio emission arising from the cooling of the x - ray emitting electrons , would be placed well outside the vla field of view due to the large proper motion of geminga : e.g. more than 0.5 deg off the position of the x - ray emission for a magnetic field of 100 @xmath29 g . in summary ,",
    "ram - pressure collimated pwn models can be applied to our case only if additional processes , such as adiabatic expansion from hypothetical over - pressurized substructures of the tail ( not observable at the present stage ) provide a cooling power much higher than the synchrotron one and/or if radio emitting electrons are directly accelerated at the pwn shock , i.e. they are not originated from the cooling of high - energy electrons as in standard pwn models . in this respect ,",
    "we note that the radio  wisps \" observed in the crab pwn are produced by the same process as the higher - energy ones , although the mechanism by which this particle spectrum is generated is still not known ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the radio tail of geminga could in principle be ascribed to a ( magnetically - collimated ) jet , in which the radio emission could directly result from radio - emitting electrons freshly - injected along the spin - axis at the jet formation site , or from internal shocks in which the accelerated x - ray - emitting leptons cool down to radio energies on the observed short space and time scales ( see e.g. @xcite for possible models of magneto - hydrodynamic jet produced by isolated pulsars ) .    in the latter case ,",
    "magnetic fields @xmath550.05 g are required in order to avoid the occurrence of an additional ( i.e other than synchrotron ) cooling process . as already noticed for the case of the ram - pressure collimated pwn models ,",
    "there is no evidence of such high fields in other pwne . however , in the first place , large magnetic fields due to the ns dipole are in principle available at the pulsar light cylinder ( @xmath56 g for geminga ) and in its surroundings . in the second place",
    ", an observational bias may also be at work here .",
    "in fact , despite the growing number of jet - like structures around nss resolved in x - rays @xcite , no ` genuine ' magneto - hydrodynamic radio jet around pulsar was detected so far ( see e.g. @xcite for vla mapping of numerous pulsar fields ) , possibly excepting psrj2021 + 4026 , another radio - quiet gamma - ray pulsar , located at the edge of the supernova remnant g78.2 + 2.1 @xcite . thus , it can not be excluded that pulsar radio jets might be observable only in nearby and radio - quiet pulsars , not hindering their close environment by bright magnetospheric radio emission and having magnetic fields much stronger than those related to other pwn structures placed at larger distances from the ns surface .",
    "interestingly enough , this hypothesis may be checked by a series of deep radio interferometric exposures . scaling our result for geminga",
    ", this survey could unveil jet - like structures in few other near ( @xmath571 kpc ) and energetic ( @xmath58 erg s@xmath5 ) radio - quiet pulsars , some of them recently discovered by the fermi satellite @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that a further possible explanation of the geminga radio tail is the leakage of radio - emitting electrons ( with lorentz factor @xmath59100 ) directly from the open field lines of the magnetosphere .",
    "the maximum current through the magnetospheric accelerator ( i.e. , the goldreich - julian current ; see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and then the maximum particle flux escaping from geminga open field lines can be estimated from @xmath60 s@xmath5 ( where @xmath61 is the pulsar angular velocity , and the ns s radius @xmath62 is assumed to be 10 km ) .",
    "the expected synchrotron power at 4.8 ghz , for a random distribution of pitch angles , can be roughly obtained from : @xmath63 where @xmath64=@xmath65@xmath66/@xmath67 is the synchrotron cooling time of the electrons , @xmath68 is the magnetic field energy density and @xmath69 is the fraction ( w.r.t .",
    "@xmath70 ) of radio emitting particles .",
    "the observed luminosity of 10@xmath71 erg s@xmath5 at 4.8 ghz would then be matched for @xmath72 , implying a magnetic field of @xmath73 g in the area of the emission .",
    "if this magnetic field is associated to the ns dipole , the emitting region would then be placed at a distance of @xmath74 cm from the ns surface . in summary , for @xmath75 ( in turn implying @xmath76 of the order of ten light cylinder radii , @xmath77 , @xmath78 g , and @xmath79 yrs ) , this model would provide a cooling and possibly expanding diffuse radio feature protruding from the geminga pulsar .",
    "if this model is correct , two geometrical constraints should be simultaneously satisfied by the geminga pulsar : the radio pulsar beam not intersecting the line of sight and the leaking electrons producing a relatively narrow cone of radio emission roughly aligned with the projection of the pulsar proper motion .",
    "this would suggest that geminga is a nearly aligned rotator , with the spin axis almost aligned with the proper motion and with the velocity vector close to the plane of the sky .",
    "we have reported on the discovery of a radio emitting structure with a flux of @xmath10.4 mjy at 4.8 ghz , associated with the geminga pulsar and roughly aligned with the direction of the neutron star proper motion .",
    "the source appears slightly extended ( @xmath1@xmath2-long ) but further deeper observations are needed to confirm the elongation unambiguously .",
    "the nature of this emission is unconstrained by present data , but a combination of dedicated radio interferometric and x - ray observations is expected to shed light on the underlying physical process and likely unveil similar radio tails in other radio - quiet pulsars .",
