    "the computation of the volume of incoming and exit sets for a `` nearly invariant '' region is the first step in the development of a dynamical theory of transport . for area - preserving maps , it is common for these regions to be bounded by segments of the stable and unstable manifolds hyperbolic invariant sets , typically periodic orbits or cantori ( aubry - mather sets ) @xcite . in this case",
    "the resulting set is a `` resonance zone '' @xcite , and its exit and entrance sets are `` lobes '' of the `` turnstile . ''",
    "when the splitting between the manifolds is small , the resonance zone is nearly invariant .",
    "the volume of a lobe is a not only a measure of the separation of the stable and unstable manifolds , it is also the _ flux _ of trajectories escaping from the resonance zone .",
    "this flux provides an estimate for the escape time from the resonance .",
    "it is known that the average exit time from a region is equal to the ratio of accessible volume of the region ( the fraction of the volume that can be reached by orbits from the outside ) to the flux @xcite . though the accessible volume is difficult to compute it is certainly bounded by the total volume of the region , so the flux provides an upper bound on the average exit time .",
    "moreover , if the flux goes to zero , but the accessible volume does not , then the average exit time must go to infinity .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the construction of lobes for resonance zones of volume - preserving maps . our goal is to generalize the results of @xcite that provide formulas for the lobe areas for the two - dimensional maps and of @xcite for the case of three - dimensional , incompressible vector fields . indeed ,",
    "one of the three open problems posed by mackay at the end of @xcite is to generalize his flow results to the case of maps .",
    "the theory of @xcite applies to exact - symplectic maps . recall that a map is symplectic when there is a closed two form , @xmath0 , ( for example @xmath1 ) that is preserved by @xmath2 : @xmath3 .",
    "we recall the notation for the pullback , @xmath4 , and similar concepts in the appendix .",
    "a map is exact - symplectic when @xmath0 is exact , @xmath5 ( for example @xmath6 ) and there exists a function @xmath7 defined by @xmath8 an often studied case is that of twist maps , which have lagrangian generating functions  the discrete analogues of the lagrangians for differential equations @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the generating function ( [ eq : exactsymplectic ] ) provides a way to compute the area of a lobe ( or of the resonance zone itself ) in terms of the action , the formal sum of @xmath7 along an orbit @xcite .",
    "the result is that a two - dimensional integral over a lobe is reduced to a zero - dimensional integral , the difference between the actions of the orbits homoclinic to the hyperbolic invariant set .",
    "thus to compute the lobe area one only needs to find these homoclinic orbits and carry out the sum ; this is considerably easier than constructing the entire lobe boundary and computing the two - dimensional integral .",
    "moreover , since the action is stationary on the orbits , its computation is second - order accurate .    for the case of incompressible vector fields , a similar result also holds . on the manifold @xmath9 , when @xmath10 there exists a vector potential @xmath11 so that @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath11 is more properly thought of as a one - form @xmath13 and it gives rise to a variational principle for orbits of the flow .",
    "moreover , mackay has shown that the one - form @xmath14 can be used to compute the flux through two - dimensional surfaces @xcite .",
    "more generally , when @xmath15 is an exact volume form and @xmath16 is an _ exact _",
    "incompressible vector field , then the curl relationship generalizes to the statement that @xmath17 is exact and @xmath14 provides the generating form ( see  [ sec : hamiltonian ] and @xcite ) as well as a variational principle@xcite .",
    "in this paper we study exact volume - preserving maps . for such maps",
    "there is also an analogue of ( [ eq : exactsymplectic ] ) in which the generator @xmath7 becomes a differential form @xmath18 , see  [ sec : exact ] .",
    "such forms were implicitly described by @xcite in the context of constructing implicit generating functions for volume - preserving maps @xcite .",
    "we will primarily study the three - dimensional case where the generator @xmath18 is a one - form .",
    "we will construct a resonance zone based on a pair of normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds , say @xmath11 and @xmath19 .",
    "for the three - dimensional case , the natural objects are periodic orbits and invariant circles .",
    "the boundary of the resonance will consist of pieces of the codimension - one stable @xmath20 and unstable @xmath21 manifolds of these invariant sets .",
    "the exit and incoming sets are obtained by iterating the resonance , see  [ sec : transport ] .",
    "unlike the two - dimensional case , the boundary of a resonance does not always consist solely of pieces of stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "indeed for this to happen , the manifolds would have to intersect on a `` proper boundary '' , see  [ sec : fundamental ] .",
    "however , we have observed that the set of heteroclinic intersections commonly contains components that are themselves bi - asymptotic to the invariant sets ; these preclude the existence of heteroclinic proper boundaries @xcite .",
    "a similar phenomena occurs for three - dimensional volume - preserving flows : when the two - dimensional manifolds of saddle equilibria intersect , they typically do so only along a few  primary \" heteroclinic orbits @xcite . to remedy this , a `` cap '' must be used to complete the resonance boundary . even though the cap is  to a large extent ",
    "arbitrary , this choice does not change the volume of the exit and incoming lobes of the resonance .",
    "our main result is thm .",
    "[ thm : main ] in  [ sec : lobevolume ] , which states that the volume of the exit and incoming lobes is given by @xmath22 here the set @xmath23 consists of the primary heteroclinic intersections of the manifolds @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and @xmath24 is the restriction of @xmath25 to a fundamental domain .",
    "thus to compute the volume of @xmath26-dimensional lobes one needs only to do @xmath27-dimensional integrals along submanifolds of heteroclinic intersections .    for the case of nearly - integrable systems , a widely used technique for detecting such heteroclinic intersections is the poincar - melnikov method @xcite .",
    "indeed , this method detects  at first order  precisely the primary intersections .",
    "the classical melnikov function computes the rate at which the distance between the manifolds changes with a perturbation , say @xmath28 . for two - dimensional maps , an integral of the melnikov function between a pair of zeros gives the rate of change of the flux with @xmath28 @xcite ; a similar result also holds for incompressible vector fields @xcite .",
    "we will show in  [ sec : melnikov ] that this same results holds for volume - preserving maps .",
    "we conclude by presenting several examples and applications in  [ sec : examples ] .",

    "suppose now that @xmath15 is exact , i.e. , there exists an @xmath35-form @xmath36 such that @xmath37 .",

    "we discuss some of the consequences of exactness in @xcite .    as an application that we will need later , consider the composition of an exact volume - preserving map with itself . in this case",
    "we can use a telescoping sum to conclude @xmath49 thus @xmath50 is exact - volume preserving with the form @xmath51      exact volume - preserving maps arise naturally in the context of perturbations from integrable maps .",
    "for example suppose that @xmath2 is a map on the phase space @xmath52 with volume form @xmath53 .",
    "this form is exact with @xmath54 .",
    "one integrable map on @xmath29 is @xmath55 with the rotation vector @xmath56 .",
    "this map is also exact volume preserving : if we define the vector field @xmath57 , then @xmath58 where @xmath59 the invariant tori of this map are `` rotational '' tori , and",
    "as we argue next , any volume preserving map on @xmath29 with a rotational invariant torus must be exact .    a _ rotational _",
    "torus on @xmath60 is a @xmath61-dimensional torus that is homotopic to the zero section @xmath62 .",
    "the _ net flux _ crossing a rotational torus @xmath63 is the difference between the signed volume below @xmath64 and that below @xmath63 : @xmath65 note that if @xmath2 is volume preserving , and @xmath63 and @xmath66 are any two rotational tori then the volume contained between them , @xmath67 , is invariant .",
    "this implies that @xmath68 is independent of the choice of torus .",
    "thus , if @xmath69 then @xmath70 for any rotational torus ; this _ intersection property _ is used in the generalization of kam theory for exact volume - preserving maps @xcite .",
    "conversely , if @xmath2 has an invariant rotational torus then @xmath71 by definition . consequently if @xmath2 has a rotational invariant torus then it is necessarily exact .",
    "exactness can be used to simplify the computation of the volume of certain regions .",

    "we assign orientations to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and by iteration to @xmath74 ; thus @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "then , when @xmath2 is exact , ( [ eq : exact ] ) immediately gives @xmath78 thus we can compute the volume of @xmath72 simply by integrating over @xmath79 .",
