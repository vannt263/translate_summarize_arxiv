    "the qpm parametrization of the lattice qcd results @xcite for @xmath38 with fairly large quark masses , i.e. @xmath39 and @xmath40 , was already presented in @xcite for the scaled pressure @xmath41 at @xmath42 .",

    "these lattice qcd results @xcite ( squares ) are astonishingly well reproduced , however , by the price of changing the pressure integration constant , @xmath52 , which needs to be readjusted in order to generate the small pressure below @xmath0 .",
    "we note that putting @xmath53 in the strikt chiral limit does not change noticeably the dashed curve on the scale exhibited in figure 1 .",
    "another important test @xcite of the suitability of our hydrodynamic eos is the interaction measure @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes the energy density .",
    "as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : pnf2 + 1extrap ] , the qpm for almost physical quark masses ( i.e. , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) faithfully reproduces corresponding lattice qcd data @xcite of @xmath56 .",

    "dashed curves represent the analytic sections of the first two roberge - weiss transition lines @xmath81 ( here @xmath82 ) turning into first - order transitions ( solid section ) while the dotted curve shows the first @xmath83 center symmetry line @xmath84 .",
    "the roberge - weiss periodicity @xcite implies that sectors between @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( sector ii for @xmath87 ) are repeated copies of sector i between @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "in summary we show that the quasiparticle model with the chosen dispersion relations for quarks and gluons accounts fairly well for the quark mass dependence in the qcd equation of state near @xmath0 as delivered by selected lattice qcd results .",
    "we emphasize further that lattice qcd calculations at imaginary chemical potential , avoiding the sign problem of the fermion determinant , give valuable information which can be continued to real chemical potential within our model .",
