    "from a lattice of time points , as is usually discussed in dynamical systems , is it possible to obtain continuous , or even smooth , time evolution without ambiguity ?  under certain circumstances ,",
    "the answer is yes , through a _",
    "holographic interpolation process _ involving functional methods .    in this paper , we utilize and illustrate schrder s functional techniques @xcite to produce continuous trajectories out of discrete nonlocal recursion laws ( orbits ) for less self - evident dynamical systems , with fixed points at @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , we build exact continuous iterations of @xmath3 , and approximations to continuous iterations of @xmath4 , and their inverses , and we discuss the notable features of the resulting evolution .  typically , smooth , analytic interpolates  of the discrete recursion rules that act as the boundary data for the process ( hence our use of the term holographic ) are obtained .",
    "these methods are of possible use to anyone pursuing practical applications of functional equations @xcite , and are also likely to be relevant to more recent theoretical developments @xcite .",
    "consider an evolution trajectory @xmath5 of a 1-dim system , e.g. specified by a local , time - translation - invariant law ( cf .",
    "energy conservation ) .",
    "@xmath6 one may integrate this to obtain the trajectory as a _ family of functions _ of the initial data , _ indexed by the time_,@xmath7 for any given time , we may scale @xmath8 to consider a unit time increment @xmath9 , so that@xmath10 but then , for time - translation - invariant systems , further evolution obeys@xmath11 i.e. @xmath12 is the _ same _ function of @xmath13 as @xmath14 is of @xmath15 .  for notational convenience in the following , we will often use @xmath16 .",
    "now suppose , for reasons dictated by physics applications , that the time - local evolution law ( [ localtimeevolution ] ) is not specified , but an explicit , nonlocal , _ discrete propagation function _",
    "@xmath17 is available , as in ( [ discretepropagation ] ) .",
    "we pose the question :  how does one obtain the complete , continuous trajectory@xmath18 without benefit of the local relation ?",
    "of course in principle , it is straightforward to compute iterates of ( [ discretepropagation ] ) on an integral lattice of time points , @xmath19 , to obtain the splinter of @xmath20  ( for example , see @xcite ) , i.e.@xmath21 etc . , assuming the domains for the various functions overlap properly .",
    "thus , @xmath22 , or more generally , @xmath23 , associative and commutative composition .  from this lattice , upon selecting derivatives at the lattice points ,",
    "an infinity of interpolating functions could be produced , say graphically , to obtain a continuous trajectory .",
    "this approach permits easy visualization of the trajectories , but is ambiguous , and does not place proper emphasis on analytic properties of the solutions , so it will not be pursued .",
    "instead , given @xmath24 we will use here the theory pioneered by ernst schrder @xcite to construct an _ analytic _",
    "@xmath25 around a fixed point of @xmath24 .  without loss of generality , we take the fixed point to be @xmath2 .",
    "schrder s construction of @xmath25 amounts to building _ all _ iterates of @xmath24 , including fractional , negative , and infinitesimal @xmath8 , based on his eponymous functional conjugacy equation involving the auxiliary function @xmath26 @xcite,@xmath27 for some constant @xmath28 . with the origin",
    "a fixed point of @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath29 , it follows that @xmath30 , and if @xmath31 , then @xmath32 .",
    "the inverse function satisfies poincar s equation , @xmath33 upon iteration of the functional equation , @xmath26 acts upon the splinter of @xmath20  to give@xmath34 now , the point to be stressed is that _ this  formula naturally yields a continuous interpolation _ for all non - integer @xmath35,@xmath36 so , to produce the full , continuous trajectory , we solve for schrder s auxiliary function @xmath37 , and construct the inverse function @xmath38 .",
    "having done so , this yields @xmath5 as a functional similarity transform of the @xmath39 multiplicative map .  from ( [ sfeinterpolated ] ) , @xmath40 in a suitable domain",
    ", this gives the _ general _ iterate for _ any _ @xmath41 , analytic around the fixed point @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , this solution manifestly satisfies the requisite associative and abelian composition properties for all iterates and inverse iterates .  that is to say , @xmath42 , hence @xmath43 , as required for time - translationally invariant systems .",
    "some specific cases are as follows.@xmath44 etc .",
    "however , it is crucial to note that in the limit @xmath45 , all iterates and inverse iterates lose their distinction and degenerate to the identity map , @xmath46 , and the method fails as written .  for this reason , if @xmath47 , one augments @xmath24 in schrder s equation to @xmath48 , and takes the @xmath45 limit only at the very end of the calculations , if it makes sense to do so .",
    "for a very elementary illustration of the technique , consider schrder s early example of a recursive evolution law,@xmath49 so @xmath29 , and @xmath50 @xmath51 .  schrder s equation ( [ sfe ] ) is then solved by@xmath52 this results in@xmath53 which indeed obeys @xmath54 .  in particular , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , etc .",
    "we may visually appreciate the evolution described by ( [ schroederexample ] ) through a surface plot , where the left - right axis is the initial position , @xmath20 , the depth axis is the time , @xmath8 ,  and the vertical axis is @xmath13 .",
    "the surface flows from the identity map at @xmath58 to the given discrete propagation function @xmath59 at @xmath60 .",
    "the origin is invariant since it is a fixed point of all the functions @xmath25 , for every value of the @xmath8 index , as is the point @xmath61 in this simple example .",
    "also note , here we require the initial @xmath62 to have real @xmath5 for all @xmath8 .",
    "schrodiator__1.eps + figure 1 : @xmath63 plotted versus t and initial @xmath20 for schrder s example .",
    "the full sweep of the surface describes not just one trajectory , starting at a single value of @xmath20 and moving into the page with @xmath8 , but rather it encodes the evolution of _ all _ trajectories from the initial domain @xmath62 .",
    "the construction is holographic in the sense that the interior of the surface is completely determined by the behavior on the time boundaries , namely , the identity map at the front edge and @xmath64 at the back edge .",
    "an animation of sequential , fixed time , vertical slices through the surface would perhaps show more clearly how the initial straight line of data evolves to the final @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the velocity profile following from ( [ schroederexample ] ) is@xmath65    schrodiator__2.eps + figure 2 :  velocity profile for schrder s example .    had this velocity been available _ ab initio _ , it could have been integrated in the usual way , i.e. @xmath66 , to obtain the trajectory ( [ schroederexample ] ) moving into the page for each @xmath20 as shown in figure 1 .  but here",
    "the starting point was the discrete time step ( [ f1example ] ) , with @xmath67 an emergent feature flowing from the formalism @xcite .",
    "moreover , assuming the motion is governed by a lagrangian , with @xmath68 , and that we are dealing with this system at a fixed energy , the result for the velocity profile immediately gives the @xmath20-dependence of the corresponding potential .",
    "namely , @xmath69 in this sense the functional method of determining the evolution surface is a technique to solve _ an inverse problem _",
    "@xcite :  given the @xmath24 scattering data  for a finite time step ( as opposed to the usual infinite time step in an idealized scattering process ) , we may determine an underlying @xmath70 upon making certain analyticity assumptions about the solution .",
    "for the schrder example , the essential features are contained in a plot of the effective potential @xmath71 .",
    "schrodiator__3.eps + figure 3 :  potential for schrder s example .",
    "note this @xmath72 is unbounded below , and more importantly , the aforementioned fixed points at @xmath61 and @xmath2 are simply _ unstable stationary points of the potential_.  we submit that this is a common feature of the functional method , when the results are expressed as a potential function .    in general , a formal solution of schrder s equation is predicated on the existence of infinite iteration limits of @xmath24 , as discovered by koenigs @xcite .",
    "( the technique itself is perhaps more familiar in the context of the poincar equation when written as a nonlinear finite difference equation . )  when the splinter is approximately geometric  ( for example , again see @xcite ) we have@xmath73 in the above example due to schrder , ( [ schroederexample ] ) , we actually require the limit as @xmath8 goes to negative infinity , @xmath74 as it is the splinter of @xmath75 that is approximately geometric .",
    "we now consider the iterates of the ricker map @xcite,@xmath76 or equivalently , of its inverse , the lambert function @xcite,@xmath77 the latter series is convergent for @xmath78 .  both @xmath24 and @xmath79  have a unique real fixed point for @xmath2 , so schrder s conjugacy equation can be solved for the auxiliary @xmath26 with the same fixed point , in power series expansion around that point .  since @xmath47 ,",
    "as explained above , we will modify ( [ xexp ] ) and ( [ lambertw ] ) to @xmath80 thereby introducing a second fixed point in @xmath17 at @xmath81 , but allowing for a possible limit @xmath45 at the end of various calculations , if sensible .",
    "the resulting schrder s equation looks deceptively simple , @xmath82 here it is implicit that @xmath26 really depends on two variables , both @xmath83 and @xmath20 , so ( [ xexpschroeder ] ) is actually @xmath84 .  in the following , this additional dependence on @xmath83  will be understood but usually not displayed .",
    "it follows from ( [ xexpschroeder ] ) that @xmath85 , along with all higher derivatives with respect to @xmath20  given by fa di bruno s general formula , hence an explicit series solution for @xmath26  about @xmath2 is straightforward to construct , in principle .    the corresponding poincar equation for the inverse function , @xmath86 , while nonlinear , is also relatively simple in appearance @xcite.@xmath87 again , it is implicit that @xmath88 depends on both @xmath83 and @xmath20 .     with the normalization choice @xmath89 ,",
    "the auxiliary function and its inverse are given explicitly to @xmath90 by@xmath91 for purposes of illustration , we plot @xmath92 approximations for the auxiliary function and its inverse versus @xmath20 for various values of @xmath83 , to obtain the surfaces below .",
    "we wish to convey only qualitative behavior at this point , not detailed structure , and to point out that for values of @xmath93 the auxiliaries have many features similar to those for schrder s example , ( [ examplepsipsiinverse ] ) .",
    "we stress that these are only approximate representations for the auxiliaries , based on the explicit series to @xmath94  we do not give the @xmath92 series explicitly for all @xmath83 , although they are straightforward to obtain .  for example , at the back and front edges of the plotted surfaces ,",
    "the series are given numerically by@xmath95@xmath96@xmath97@xmath98 also , we have avoided @xmath99 in the plots of figures 4 and 5 since the explicit series results exhibit an expected singular behavior as @xmath45 for each of @xmath26 and @xmath38 , considered separately .",
    "this behavior is foreshadowed by the growing coefficients in the numerical series for @xmath100 and @xmath101 .     however , when @xmath26 and @xmath38 are _ composed _ as in ( [ fst ] ) , the result for @xmath25 is well - behaved even in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "take @xmath102 , and expand in powers of @xmath103 , to find@xmath104 despite what one might _",
    "naively _ expect from the form of @xmath17 in ( [ xexpmod ] ) , the dependence of @xmath105 on @xmath83 is certainly _ not _ multiplicative , a point already borne out by @xmath75 in ( [ xexpmod ] ) .  of course , as @xmath106",
    "all @xmath103 dependence ( i.e. all orders in @xmath103 ) must disappear to yield the identity map @xmath107 , and indeed ( [ explicitft ] ) reduces accordingly .",
    "this last result permits us to compute , at least to @xmath108 , the initial velocity profile in the limit @xmath45 , to find @xmath109 a better numerical approximation keeps all terms to @xmath110 , to give@xmath111 as plotted here .",
    "schrodiator__6.eps + figure 6 :  initial velocity profile to @xmath92 as @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , from time - translational invariance , we automatically obtain power series approximations to @xmath112 for all @xmath8 just by substitution of @xmath5 in either of ( [ initialvelocity1 ] ) or ( [ betterinitialvelocity ] ) .",
    "we may also visualize the effective potential for this problem from a plot of @xmath113 , as discussed previously in the context of schrder s example .",
    "schrodiator__7.eps + figure 7 :  effective potential to @xmath92 as @xmath45 .    as in that previous example , we see the fixed point at @xmath2 is a point of unstable equilibrium .",
    "a similar calculation produces the initial velocity profile for other @xmath114 .  again to @xmath108 , we find @xmath115 here we have made explicit the dependence on both @xmath20 and @xmath83 .  of course in the limit @xmath45 , @xmath116 remains finite and reduces to the previous ( [ initialvelocity1 ] ) .",

    "continuations out of the page would give the corresponding inverse functions , @xmath123 , including @xmath124 .",
    "we reiterate that this evolution surface was not obtained by the standard method of integrating velocities for individual initial @xmath20 to produce the lines that go into the @xmath8 depth of the mesh , but rather by the use of functional methods to produce the continuous , inward flow of complete left to right time slices  of the surface @xcite .    with these qualitative images in view , we turn to discuss in more detail the series solutions for the auxiliaries and the composite functions @xmath125 that follow from @xmath126 .  generally , the series for @xmath26 and @xmath38 are of the form@xmath127 the @xmath128 are polynomials in @xmath83 , and can be obtained explicitly by recursion from @xmath129 using @xcite@xmath130 direct calculation gives leading and lowest powers of @xmath83 in each of these polynomials.@xmath131 so written , a power is understood to be _ absent _ when any exponent in its coefficient is @xmath132 .",
    "there is also an exact sum rule  for each polynomial.@xmath133 the auxiliary function s leading asymptotic behavior is given for extreme values of @xmath83 by@xmath134 as well as the formal result , @xmath135 recall in the power series for @xmath26 we chose to take the coefficient of @xmath20  to be unity , but that normalization is arbitrary .",
    "so too are the normalizations for the asymptotic expressions .",
    "now consider some particular functional roots and powers .  an obvious check on the series for @xmath26 and @xmath38 is to verify that @xmath136 , and indeed this is true to @xmath108 for the explicit results given in ( [ explicitpsi ] ) and ( [ explicitpsiinverse ] ) .",
    "also , when @xmath137 it is well - known that the inverse function is @xmath138 , as in ( [ xexpmod ] ) .",
    "we may check that the previous series for @xmath26 and @xmath38 do indeed give the series for @xmath139 when we take @xmath140 in @xmath141 .  for generic @xmath83 , using the explicit series ( [ explicitpsi ] ) and ( [ explicitpsiinverse ] ) , we find@xmath142 in perfect agreement with the textbook power series for @xmath143 .  as another example , the functional square - root , such that @xmath144 , follows immediately for any @xmath83 .  for instance,@xmath145 where we have avoided any irrational coefficients by the choice @xmath146 .",
    "this is quickly checked to satisfy @xmath147 , to the order given .",

    "schrodiator__11.eps + figure 11 :  first four integer iterates of",
    "@xmath165  ( @xmath17 ,  @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 ) plotted alternately in green and orange , above the identity map in black .",
    "mirror imaging any one of these curves through the straight line of the identity map in the usual way gives the upper branch of the corresponding inverse function , e.g. @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 , and establishes the radius of convergence of the taylor series expansion for @xmath173 to be just @xmath174 .",

    "once more these curves are just time slices from the @xmath25 surface in figure 11 .  for a measure of the accuracy of the @xmath181 series approximations used to make this last plot , note that @xmath182 does not always vanish in the plot , but for the exact function , _ it should_.  in the plot , disparities are clearly discernible as @xmath183 , especially for the orange curves , where instead of vanishing we see that @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 .  numerically from the series , @xmath187,@xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 .",
    "these numerical disparities exist because @xmath157 lies precisely at the radius of convergence for the power series in question and is a branch point in the exact functions for generic @xmath8 , so the series become poor approximations as @xmath183 .",
    "better numerical results for fractional iterates near @xmath157 can be obtained by incorporating branch points into approximate trial solutions of the functional equation , and then matching these solutions onto the series for @xmath193 .",
    "this is work in progress .",

    "what is the physical meaning of the resulting function @xmath209 ?",
    "the answers are straightforward .",
    "write the equation to place emphasis on the time dependence : @xmath210",
    ".  then analyticity near @xmath58 requires @xmath211 , and , if @xmath212 , then @xmath213 .",
    "we also have @xmath214 , where additional @xmath208 dependence of @xmath209 , if any , is now implicit .",
    "so , dynamical evolution along a single trajectory is in this sense a functional similarity transformation acting on the initial velocity :  @xmath215 .  as a consequence of any non - commutativity between @xmath209 and the simple multiplicative map , we will have @xmath216 , and the trajectory will evolve as a _ _ non__linear function of @xmath8  with linear @xmath8 dependence being just _ free _ particle behavior : @xmath217 .",
    "we may again think of @xmath209 as an auxiliary function defined on the initial phase space which encodes all solutions of the classical equations of motion .",
    "this change of time variable simply _",
    "rescales _ the solution .",

    "we have discussed how , under certain circumstances , the answer to this last question is affirmative .  it remains to see whether the method can be applied in all situations .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that this particular functional method will be applicable to problems in classical chaos @xcite , to complement existing methods for analyzing unstable fixed points .",
