    "the star formation rate density ( @xmath3 ) in the local universe and the spatial distribution of emission - line galaxies ( elgs ) as a function of environment are fundamental pieces in the field of formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "there are few techniques as good as slitless spectroscopy for bulk - searching of this object class . from the mid 1960s to the near past",
    "the photographic plates were used as unique detectors in the search on elgs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ; and references therein ; ) .",
    "the ucm ( universidad complutense de madrid ) survey @xcite is one of the more recent initiatives devoted to the photographic searching of elgs and their findings motivated this work .",
    "substitution of photographic plates by large - format ccds , including ccd mosaics , is really a challenge for many observatories with competitive aperture schmidt telescopes , some of them equipped with objective - prisms .",
    "consequently , the ccd - based objective - prism surveys could be taken as a promising technique for the search of extragalactic emission - line systems .",
    "examples of two successful objective - prism digital surveys are presented by @xcite and @xcite , the latter best known as the kpno international spectroscopic survey , kiss .",
    "the cida - ucm - yale ( centro de investigaciones de astronoma , universidad complutense de madrid and yale university ) survey , hereafter cuys , is the first stage of an observational effort with the main goal of identifying and studying emission - line galaxies ( elgs ) based on digital low - resolution spectra in contrast with spectroscopic surveys which involve follow - up observations or multifiber instruments .",
    "once the second part of this equatorial objective - prism survey is completed , we expect to have catalogued more than 10,000 elgs with blue and red low - resolution spectra ( 4,000 - 9,200  ) over @xmath4deg@xmath1 .",
    "the cuys is being carried out in the 1 m schmidt telescope located at the venezuelan national astronomical observatory , llano del hato , mrida , venezuela .",
    "this telescope is equipped with a @xmath5 objective - prism ( reciprocal dispersion @xmath625    arcsec@xmath7 in @xmath2 at rest ) and a @xmath8 ccd mosaic covering @xmath9 on the sky .",
    "the ccds are @xmath10 loral devises with 15@xmath11 m pixels . the camera and its operation details are fully described in @xcite .",
    "our strategy to select elgs is the detection of @xmath06549,6584 $ ]    emission on reduced 1-dimensional spectra of extended sources listed in the apm catalogue @xcite . because objective - prism dispersion decreases in the red portion of the spectra",
    ", absorption bands present in late - type star spectra could generate false emission line detections . to avoid these contaminants , among others",
    ", we chose to ignore the spectra of point - like sources . taking into account the galactic latitude range of the cuys observations ,",
    "data reduction allowed us to obtain a statistically complete catalogue of active star - forming galaxies and to study the spatial distribution of these objects on medium and large scales ( above @xmath12 mpc ) .",
    "several approaches have been used to study this topic during the last 15 years .",
    "it is well established that elgs can be found near structures defined by luminous normal galaxies @xcite or populating low galaxy density regions in the nearby universe . consequently , there is a relation between mean star formation rate ( sfr ) and environment in the sense that @xmath3 decreases as the galaxy number density increases ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have established an inverse relation between environmental surface density and sfr measured using elgs from the sdss .",
    "a plausible explanation is that the high mean sfr in low density environments of the local universe is only a contrast effect resulting from the mild sfr in high density regions in which galaxies are stripped of their gas with more probability .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "an analysis of the catalogue properties is the aim of section 2 . in section 3",
    "we use the resulting cuys elg catalogue to find the parameters of the  luminosity function ( lf ) and estimate the @xmath3 in the local universe using fluxes and equivalent widths ( @xmath13 ) measured directly from objective - prism spectra . in section 4 we analyse the spatial distribution of elgs in our survey in terms of the 2-point correlation function and other statistical estimators related to the spatial distribution at large scales .",
    "we conclude in section 5 . throughout this paper",
    ", we adopt the standard notation @xmath14 and the cosmology @xmath15 and @xmath16 , nevertheless the latter assumption has not much effect on the redshift range of our survey .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     mpc .",
    "the dotted line is the fit to cf for the sdss2 sample and the dashed line is a reference from the sdsser ( 2002 ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the bias between the cuys cosu and the sdss2 sample correlation function , defined as the quotient of both quantities.,width=321 ]      as indicated in the introduction to this paper , a recent and detailed analysis about the effect of environment on the star formation activity in the local universe was published by @xcite .",
    "they found that the sfr in nearby galaxies is strongly correlated with the _ projected _ galaxy density in at least three diferent ( and complementary ) ways : ( a ) the decrease of the overall sfr distribution in dense environments compared to the field population ; ( b ) this effect is most noticeable for the stronger star - forming galaxies ; ( c ) the existence of a characteristic density in the density - sfr relation at a local galaxy density of @xmath17 mpc@xmath18 .    despite the limitations imposed by the absence of a morphological classification of cuys cosu elgs and the relative small size of this subsample , we have extracted additional information about the effects of environment on sfr density",
    "the availability of a characteristic correlation lenght @xmath19 for the cuys elgs give us the opportunity to use a different approach in the quantification of the environmental effects discussed in the section 4.1 .",
    "the distance @xmath19 separates the regime of large spatial density fluctuations from the regime of small fluctuations .",
    "the latter can be interpreted as a homogeneous galaxy distribution , but this is a current topic of debate @xcite .",
    "we now use the cuys cosu correlation length @xmath19 as a characteristic radius to compute the environment galaxy density in the redshift space .",
    "this corresponds to an _ elg - centric _ perspective of the environmental effects on star formation .",
    "we calculate the average density of galaxies , @xmath20 , and the star formation rate density @xmath21 inside spheres of radius @xmath19 centered in each galaxy of the cuys cosu , integrating the @xmath22 of the galaxies involved in each volume .",
    "the results are expressed as a distribution function in fig .",
    "[ sfrclust ] . the inverse proportionality between the environment and the sfr spatial density is not only evident , but a power - law behaviour describes rather well this phenomenon .",
    "the best - fit to the distribution is    @xmath23     in redshift space derived from the 2-point correlation function fitted to the cuys cosu sample.,width=321 ]    this is the first reported quantitative parametrisation of the sfr density dependence on the average _ spatial _ density of galaxies based on elgs with vigorous star formation .",
    "we have deliberately omitted the separation between dense environments and field populations of elgs to obtain a perspective about the _ continuum _ without `` breaks '' that seems to link both variables at a distance scale comparable to @xmath19 .",
    "an interesting future work could be to profit from the sdss recent releases to explore more deeply the spatial environmental effects on the sfr , using perhaps other descriptors of galaxy clustering .",
    "in this paper we present the basic properties of the objective - prism cuys for elgs , with special emphasis on the z@xmath24 sample . the size , covered sky area , and @xmath0 $ ] flux distribution ,",
    "make our survey competitive with other modern elg surveys .",
    "technical limitations forced us to search and find elgs with @xmath25  .",
    "thus , all the work in this paper refers to local galaxies with vigorous star formation .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * objective - prism searchs for elgs provide a productive and cheap method to generate large catalogues of local sb - like , hii region - like and active galaxies .",
    "we used the driftscan technique , coadding 1-dimensional reduced spectra from multiple scans of the same region of the sky .",
    "* the typical colour of elgs in our sample is @xmath26 , comparable to the mean colour of local hubble types _ i m _ and _ scd_. the analysis of the diagnostic diagram for spectral classification reveals that more than 80 per cent of the cuys elgs can be considered star - forming galaxies . from this fraction ,",
    "nearly 75 per cent is dominated by sb - like elgs .",
    "photoionization models imply that these galaxies have metallicities between 0.4 and 1@xmath27 with instantaneous bursts of star formation aged less than 2 myr . * compared with the lf(@xmath2 ) derived from deeper surveys , the cuys lf(@xmath2 ) shows good agreement with previous results except in the low @xmath2 luminosity region , where we find a small deficit attributed to the survey selection effects .",
    "nevertheless the star formation rate density that we calculate is in agreement with values reported in the literature . * on average ,",
    "the sfr for galaxies associated with groups / clusters of quiescent galaxies is 0.5 to 0.7 times the value for isolated elgs .",
    "the fraction of elgs regarded as _ grouped _ versus _ isolated _ is 0.1 ; additionally , the mean density ratio between star - forming and quiescent galaxies is on the order of @xmath28 .",
    "thus , it is clear that elgs avoid dense regions of quiescent galaxies . *",
    "elg clustering is statistically indistinguishable from quiescent galaxy grouping in redshift space scales from 3.5 to 8.5 @xmath29mpc . between @xmath30 and 3 @xmath29mpc ,",
    "elgs are 2 to 5 times less clustered than quiescent galaxies , whereas below 1 @xmath29mpc ( @xmath61 abell radius ) in redshift space , elgs are anti - clustered or they are arranged regularly .",
    "this result is in agreement with the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario .",
    "perhaps today elgs are isolated systems that have not yet started the merging process .",
    "conversely , merged galaxies that formed isolated luminous galaxies or today cluster galaxies , have been depleted of enormous amounts of gas and they show today few star formation events . * finally , we propose a parametrization of the relation between sfr density and environment density . as far as this survey is concerned , there seems to exist a continuum dependence between these variables which can be described by a power - law .",
    "we are especially grateful to cida colleagues who have participated in different discussions about topics directly involved in this paper .",
    "special thanks to the night assistants o.  contreras , f.  moreno , r.  rojas and u.  snchez and the professional observers l.  romero and d.  herrera of the venezuelan national astronomical observatory for their constant effort .",
    "we also acknowledge the useful suggestions from an anonymous referee .",
    "the alternative calculation of the lf ( ) using an extintion correction estimated from a correlation between @xmath31 and @xmath32 is included in the referee s recommendations .",
