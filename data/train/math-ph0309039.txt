    "the decomposition of functions integrable on a finite segment into fourier series of trigonometric functions of one variable is a well known method ( e.g. @xcite ) whose theoretical and practical aspects have been thoroughly investigated during the last two centuries in connection with its numerous applications in science and engineering .",
    "it is natural to question whether any attempt to add something to it is not in fact a reinvention of what has been found before .",
    "our general goal , which goes beyond this paper , is to elaborate a new decomposition method of functions of @xmath15 variables into fourier series using orbit functions of compact semisimple lie groups @xcite , with the idea of ( i ) making it accessible to users who are not specialists in lie theory , ( ii ) underlining the versatility of its practical implementations , and ( iii ) most importantly , demonstrating the fertility of the underlying theme of this approach .",
    "one can find complete answers to limited questions ( like the values of a finite number of fourier coefficients ) replacing the lie group by a suitably chosen set of its discrete elements .",
    "the choice of the discrete elements is clearly crucial .    in the context of our goal ,",
    "the @xmath5 case results in the simplest example of the new method , even though that is the case where the potential advantages of the method based on the symmetry groups could be most limited . remarkably , however , in this low dimensional space the discrete fourier transform on the su(2 ) group results in one type of famous discrete cosine transforms discovered in 1974 @xcite , or more exactly the dct-1 , according to the currently accepted classification ( see @xcite ) .",
    "its comparison with the standard method is both misleading and revealing .",
    "it is misleading because it is considerably similar ( see @xcite ) to the standard discrete fourier transform abbreviated typically as dft ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless it is revealing , since it can help to understand better the underlying reasons why for many practical applications the dct is proven significantly more efficient than the dft . in this paper",
    "we consider the concept of _ continuous extension _ of the discrete transform , and show that the convergence properties of the continuous extension of the inverse dct , abbreviated here simply as cedct , match very closely the properties of the canonical ( _ continuous _ ) fourier transform ( cft ) of smooth functions .",
    "meanwhile , the continuous extension of the inverse dft , abbreviated simply as cedft , does not result in a reasonable function at all .",
    "note that for the sake of simplicity , if the `` inverse '' is not explicitly used , we will henceforth adopt dft and dct ( or dgt in a more general sense ) abbreviations for both direct and inverse fourier transforms .",
    "in section 2 we present the basics of the fourier analysis on the 2 group , which also demonstrates the general formalism used for the fourier transforms on lie groups .",
    "we show that in practice the fourier transform of a class function of 2 to the orbit functions of this group is reduced to the decomposition of a discrete function @xmath16 defined on the @xmath3-interval grid of variable @xmath17 $ ] onto the series of @xmath18 cosine functions ( including @xmath19 ) of the harmonic order @xmath20 .",
    "the basis for the dct series is thus composed of the first @xmath3 _",
    "half-_harmonics of the @xmath21 function , i.e. @xmath22 , meaning that the harmonic order of these functions may be formally both integer for @xmath23 even , _ and _ half - integer for odd @xmath23 .",
    "this approach is compared to the standard method of dft where the given @xmath24 is decomposed into the trigonometric polynomials of @xmath25 of the _ full _ harmonic order @xmath26 . in section 2",
    "we also define the continuous extension of the discrete transform on the continuum @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "we then compare cedct and cedft , and show that although both dct and dft formally belong to the group of _ exact _ discrete transforms , surprisingly , only the cedct converges with increasing @xmath3 to the continuous function @xmath28)$ ] which originates the grid function @xmath29 .    in section 3 ,",
    "we prove some important properties of the cedct .",
    "these properties closely resemble those of the canonical cft polynomials where the coefficients are found by accurate integrations , such as the principle of _ locality _ of cedct .",
    "this feature can ensure , in particular , that numerical computation errors or uncertainties in one segment of the interval @xmath30 $ ] would not dramatically affect the results in a distant segment , which maybe very important for effective truncation of the discrete transform sequence resulting in the loss of the _ exactness _ of the discrete transform .",
    "another important property proven in section 3 is that , similar to the cft polynomials , the term - by - term derivative series of the continuous extension of an @xmath3-interval dct converges to @xmath31 with the increase of @xmath3 .",
    "note that this property holds for any smooth originating function @xmath13 , in particular when @xmath32 ( which is not necessarily the case for other types of discrete fourier transforms ) .    in section 4 ,",
    "we extend the formalism of one - dimensional dgt on 2 , or the dct , for decomposition of multidimensional functions , and bring examples of approximation of some 2-dimensional discrete functions / images by a continuous extension of 2-dimensional cedcts .",
    "the lie group 2 can be realized as a set of all 2@xmath332 unitary complex - valued matrices @xmath34 , with @xmath35 . a complex valued _ class function _",
    "@xmath36 on 2 is any map of 2 onto the complex number space @xmath37 which is invariant under conjugation , i.e. @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for all @xmath40 . since the defining 2-dimensional representation of 2 is faithful , we can use it in order to describe the discrete elements of 2 of interest to us",
    ".    any unitary matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation .",
    "therefore every element of 2 is conjugate to at least one diagonal matrix in the defining 2-dimensional representation .",
    "all the elements which can be simultaneously diagonalized form a maximal torus t of 2 .",
    "since all maximal tori are 2-conjugate , we can write : @xmath41 furthermore , using @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 .",
    "therefore every element of 2 is conjugate to just one element in the subset @xmath44 , where @xmath45    trace functions , otherwise called _ characters _ , play an important role in 2 . for any element @xmath46 of",
    ", we have @xmath47 . in general",
    ", @xmath48 is a class function because for all @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 denote a complex algebra generated by the character functions of 2 .",
    "it is well known then that @xmath51 has a linear basis consisting of the characters of all finite dimensional irreducible representations of 2 .    with each irreducible representation of a semisimple lie group , in particular 2 , one associates a set of weights ( weight system ) of the representation @xcite , which is a union of orbits of weights under the action of the weyl group , @xmath52 .",
    "in physics the 2-weights are known as projections of the angular momenta which have integer and half - integer eigenvalues . in mathematics",
    "one usually prefers to deal with the doubles of the angular momenta in order to avoid non - integers .",
    "the weyl group of 2 is very simple .",
    "it is of order 2 , consisting of 2 elements generated by action of the reflection operator @xmath53 .",
    "it acts on any element @xmath54 of the 1-dimensional space @xmath55 of the ` projections of angular momenta ' in the straightforward way : @xmath56 .",
    "the finite dimensional irreducible representations of 2 and of its lie algebra @xmath57 are well known , but we would point out the following . the ` angular momentum states ' , the basis vectors of representation spaces , are eigenvectors of the ` diagonal ' generator of @xmath57 . unlike the common normalization of that generator in physics , we normalize it so that its eigenvalues are twice the usual projections of angular momenta .",
    "the set of the eigenvalues @xmath58 designates the weight system of the representation @xmath59 .",
    "the weight system of an irreducible representation consists of @xmath60 weights , @xmath61 where @xmath59 is the highest weight ( ` twice the angular momentum ' ) of the representation ; @xmath59 is used to specify the representation .",
    "note that all the elements of @xmath58 have the same parity .",
    "a @xmath52-orbit of a weight @xmath62 thus consists of one or two elements : @xmath63    the character @xmath64 is a function of conjugacy classes of the elements of 2 . every class is represented by one value of @xmath65 within @xmath66 .",
    "the values of the character of an irreducible representation @xmath59 can be written as the sum of values of the orbit functions @xmath67 , @xmath68 @xmath69 only for the 1- and 2-dimensional representations , @xmath70 and 1 respectively , the character consists of a single orbit function . note that @xmath71 is symmetric ( antisymmetric ) with respect to the midpoint of its range of @xmath65 for @xmath62 even ( odd ) .",
    "the decomposition of irreducible characters into the sum of orbit functions is given by a triangular matrix .",
    "hence it is invertible .",
    "therefore the orbit functions @xmath72 also form a basis in the space of class functions @xmath73 of 2 . using",
    ", it implies that @xmath74 there are two properties of the expansion which we want to underline : + ( i )  it can be reduced to the familiar case of the standard fourier decomposition of @xmath73 in the interval @xmath75 $ ] , if one makes an even extension @xmath76 for @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "+ ( ii ) although @xmath73 is being expanded into a series of functions which are periodic within the range @xmath78 , the actual range of @xmath65 in makes periodic only the cosines with even values of @xmath62 , i.e @xmath79 .",
    "their arguments vary over the range @xmath80 , i.e. over an integer multiple of @xmath81 .",
    "the discrete fourier transform differs from by the fact that the independent variable @xmath65 takes only finite number of rational values within its range of variation .    fixing a rational value of @xmath65 , one fixes an element of finite order ( efo ) belonging to the 2 torus t. every conjugacy class of efo in 2",
    "is represented by an element of t with @xmath66 . in 2",
    "one can be explicit , see @xcite or @xcite   4  for all other compact simple lie groups .",
    "let @xmath82 denote the set of all elements of t whose adjoint order divides @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is a positive integer .",
    "the adjoint order is the order of the element represented by matrices of irreducible representations of 2 of odd dimensions ( i.e. @xmath59 even ) .",
    "there are exactly @xmath18 2-conjugacy classes of such elements . taking the unique diagonal matrix as representative of each conjugacy class , in representations of dimensions @xmath83 and @xmath84 , we have the following set of matrices @xmath85",
    "@xmath86    the trace functions of each of these matrices , of size @xmath87 , represent the characters @xmath88 of the representation @xmath59 , which can be used for decomposition of the class functions on 2 ( and generally on compact simple lie groups ) .    a more suitable basis for such a decomposition consists of orbit functions @xcite .",
    "it makes possible ( _ practical _ ) decomposition of class functions on groups of high rank , e.g. such as @xmath89 @xcite . in the case of 2 ,",
    "the orbit functions are also much closer to the familiar set of exponentials @xmath90 used in the standard fourier analysis .",
    "note that the elements @xmath91 are equidistant over the fundamental region @xmath92\\}$ ] of the weyl group @xmath52 .",

    "it is known @xcite , and it can be verified by direct computation , that the set of orbit functions @xmath98 is orthogonal on the discrete equidistant @xmath3-interval grid with respect to this form .",
    "more precisely , we have : @xmath99    for further convenience and for comparison of the results with the conventional fourier series , let us instead of orbit functions @xmath71 defined by consider the functions @xmath100 for all @xmath101 .",
    "then one can easily verify that for @xmath102 @xmath103 where @xmath104 is given by . the method proposed below for decomposition of the class functions into series of orbit functions",
    "is based on the discrete orthogonality relation .",
    "let @xmath105 be a class function that can be decomposed into a _ finite _ series of orbit functions : @xmath106 this can be compared with the general case of infinite series and with the discrete fourier transform ( 2 ) in @xcite .",
    "our goal now is to find the expansion coefficients @xmath107 . in order to use the orthogonality property , we form a system of @xmath18 linear equations for @xmath108 , restricting @xmath65 in to the discrete set of its values @xmath109 , with @xmath110 : @xmath111 after multiplication of by @xmath112 and summing over @xmath113",

    "we recall that the standard discrete fourier transform , i.e. dft , has the same property .",
    "it seems then natural to ask if it is possible to recover the originating function @xmath13 by a fourier series not only at the grid points @xmath135 , but also on the entire continuous segment @xmath27 $ ] . in order to answer this question ,",

    "similar to dct , one can also continuously extend to all points of the segment @xmath27 $ ] any other types of discrete transforms , in particular the dft , resulting in cedft .",
    "below we will address two important questions .",
    "first , how well the cedct approximates any ` reasonably behaved ' ( e.g. continuous ) function @xmath13 on the interval @xmath30 $ ] outside the points of the grid .",
    "the second question is how it compares with the cedft . at last ,",
    "we will also briefly address the question of the possible use of cedct in practical applications , in particular , for purposes of smooth representation of compressed images .    in order to provide a partial answer to the first question , we consider two examples .    * example  1 .",
    "* let us take a gaussian function @xmath144,\\qquad t\\in [ 0,1],\\ ] ] with the dispersion @xmath145 , and choose @xmath146 .",
    "thus we have chosen a rather coarse grid relative to the dispersion : the width of its intervals @xmath147 is equal to the dispersion .",
    "the coefficients are readily calculated using @xmath148 from : @xmath149 the corresponding cedct function reads : @xmath150 where the coefficients are given by .",
    "now we are in a position to compare with . at the grid points @xmath151 the functions coincide , @xmath152 ( which is easily verified ) .",
    "one may then expect large deviations of @xmath153 from @xmath13 around intermediate points of the grid , i.e. @xmath154 and 5/6 : @xmath155 a good agreement between @xmath156 and @xmath13 is apparent even for @xmath157 where @xmath13 becomes very small .",
    "* example  2 .",
    "* dct approximation for a more complicated function is found in fig .  1 , where we show @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , for the function @xmath13 composed of two gaussians , @xmath161 with amplitudes @xmath162 , @xmath163 , narrow dispersions @xmath164 , and centered at @xmath165 , @xmath166 .    for comparison , in fig .  1 we show by dashed lines the approximations to @xmath13 provided by the trigonometric cft polynomials where the transform coefficients are calculated by exact integrations .",

    "cedgt series approximates the original function @xmath13 reasonably well even in the case of narrow structures with dispersions as small as @xmath177 .",
    "first , let us recall some properties of the standard exploitation of the discrete fourier transform .",
    "further details can be found in many books ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "the standard dft is formally derived from an approximate calculation of the integral coefficients @xmath178 for the trigonometric fourier series , using a simple rule of rectangles for integration of @xmath178 in when the function @xmath0 is given on the @xmath3-interval equidistant grid , @xmath179 .",
    "this leads to dft coefficients @xmath180 where @xmath147 is the length of the sampling interval @xmath181 ( assuming for simplicity @xmath182 ) .    a crucial feature of this definition of dft consists in the fact that the system of equations for the first @xmath3 coefficients @xmath183 can be inverted with respect to @xmath184 .",
    "such a possibility is based on the observation that the matrices with matrix elements @xmath185 are inverse to each other . thus one gets the _ inverse _ dft in the following form @xmath186 thus , the discrete sets @xmath187 and @xmath29 represent a pair of exact ( _ lossless _ ) direct and inverse transforms ( e.g. see @xcite ) in the form of fourier series , which is generally treated as the exact _ solution _ to the problem of fourier transform of discrete functions given on the equidistant grid .",
    "we argue below , however , that there are significant reasons to suggest that the real ( and not only formal ) exact solution to the problem of discrete fourier transform of a grid function is provided by the dct transform pair given by and .",
    "it retains all the ` good ' properties of the dft :    ( i )  it is easy and fast to compute ;    \\(ii ) it is a lossless discrete transform , with the exact inverse dct at all @xmath18 points of the grid ( even if @xmath32 , unlike for dft ) ;    however , in addition to these properties , the continuous extension of dct , @xmath12 in , converges to the originating continuous function @xmath13 with increasing @xmath3 , as illustrated in the previous section , and as it is proved in the next section . only the continuous extension of the dct , and not",
    "the dft , reveals properties characteristic to the canonical continuous fourier transform series .",
    "it is worth noting here that the very good convergence properties seem to be a common feature for the discrete lie group transforms , as we also demonstrate on the example of su(3 ) group in the accompanying paper .",
    "the basic mathematics of dgt has been formulated @xcite for any dimension @xmath188 .",
    "in fact there are as many different variants of the method one could use , as there are different semisimple compact lie groups of rank @xmath15 , and then within each variant the choice of the points of the grid is also far from unique , except for the lowest cases like 2 .",
    "it then provides an opportunity to make a choice of appropriate dgt in situations where the choice of symmetry is dictated by the experimental data .",
    "the absence of the convergence property for the continuous extension of the dft given by is not easy to anticipate because cedft looks like a fourier polynomial , or a cut - off of an ` ordinary ' fourier expansion : @xmath189    similar to cedct , it satisfies the equality @xmath190 on the grid points @xmath191 for grid knot can also be included in dft provided that @xmath192 . ] all @xmath193 .",
    "the fact that their continuous extensions cedgt and cedft behave quite differently is illustrated in example  3 .",
    "it has rarely been emphasized that @xmath194 _ does not _ approximate the initial function @xmath13 between the grid points , and it does not converge at all to any continuous function ( except for a trivial case of @xmath195 ) with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "it is worth citing in this regard @xcite , p.  87 : `` the dft is a fourier representation of finite length sequence which is itself a sequence rather than a continuous function '' .",

    "although @xmath194 passes through all @xmath201 at @xmath202 ( shown as full dots ) , similar to @xmath12 , its behaviour in between shows profound oscillations due to the presence in of high - frequency fourier components , @xmath203 ( if @xmath204 ) , with values of @xmath205 comparable to @xmath3 .",
    "these oscillations in cedft do not decrease with increasing @xmath3 , but they quickly disappear in cedct .    this behaviour is explained by the fact that at any large @xmath3 the @xmath23-th order harmonic , @xmath206 , strongly varies and changes its sign in a narrow interval @xmath207 for high orders @xmath208 . therefore the rectangular integration rule in can not provide any reasonable similarity between the canonical cft coefficients @xmath178 in and their standard dft ` approximations ' @xmath209 in . effectively , the ` fine tuning ' between the coefficients for high - order harmonics intrinsic to the continuous fourier transform is lost .",

    "computations allow an increase in the speed of practical calculations of dfts by one or two orders of magnitude .",

    "meanwhile , for special values of @xmath3 , fft algorithms can significantly reduce the required number of elementary operations , e.g. down to @xmath212 in case of @xmath213 .",
    "the discussion of various fft algorithms , extensively developed later on by many authors ( e.g. @xcite ) , is outside the scope of this article .",
    "here we note only that the fft methods are fundamentally exploiting the property of the standard dft coefficients that in their complex - value representation they can be reduced to a power - law series of a single complex element @xmath214 as @xmath215 .",
    "this would not be possible if more accurate integration methods to deal with the high - order harmonics were used .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the dct does allow for the application of fft methods since it can be formally reduced to @xmath216-point dft , and a number of efficient fft - based algorithms have been developed for dct ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , a number of efficient algorithms competing with fft and specific to dct have been developed ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "a simple modification could significantly improve behaviours of continuous extensions of discrete fourier transform series based on the use of standard dft coefficients , but not without penalty .",
    "namely , recall that for a sufficiently smooth function @xmath13 in , the rectangular integration rule provides good accuracy for approximating @xmath178 for low - order harmonics , @xmath217 .",
    "since fft algorithms allow fast calculation of @xmath218 , and as far as @xmath13 can be generally well approximated with the cft trigonometric polynomials with @xmath219 ( as shown below ) , one can only use the first half of the standard dft coefficients @xmath209 for construction of a continuous extension of the inverse discrete transform sequence .",

    "<S> a versatile method is described for the practical computation of the exact discrete fourier transforms ( dft ) , both the direct and the inverse ones , of a continuous function @xmath0 given by its values @xmath1 at the points of a uniform grid @xmath2 generated by conjugacy classes of elements of finite adjoint order @xmath3 in the fundamental region @xmath4 of compact semisimple lie groups . </S>",
    "<S> the present implementation of the method is for the groups @xmath5 , when @xmath6 is reduced to a one - dimensional segment , and for @xmath7 in multidimensional cases . </S>",
    "<S> this simplest case turns out to be a version of the discrete cosine transform ( dct ) . </S>",
    "<S> implementations , abbreviated as dgt for _ discrete group transform _ </S>",
    "<S> , based on simple lie groups of higher ranks , are considered separately .    </S>",
    "<S> dct is often considered to be simply a specific type of the standard dft . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that the dct is very different from the standard dft when the properties of the _ continuous extensions _ of the two inverse discrete transforms from the discrete @xmath8 to all points @xmath9 are studied . </S>",
    "<S> the following properties of the continuous extension of dct ( called cedct ) are proven and exemplified .    like the standard dft </S>",
    "<S> , the dct also returns the exact values of @xmath10 on the @xmath11 points of the grid . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike the continuous extension of the standard dft ,    \\(a ) the cedct function @xmath12 closely approximates @xmath13 _ between _ the points of the grid as well .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(b ) for increasing @xmath3 , the derivative of @xmath12 converges to the derivative of @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(c ) for cedct the principle of locality is valid .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we use the continuous extension of the 2-dimensional dct , @xmath14 , to illustrate its potential for interpolation as well as for the data compression of 2d images .    </S>"
