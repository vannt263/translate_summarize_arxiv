    "magnetic fields can penetrate into the layered high-@xmath0 superconductors(lhts ) and generate the well - known vortex matter.@xcite thermal fluctuations and the effects of disorder are able to drive the vortex matter to undergo very complicated phase transitions among glass , solid and liquid phases .",
    "@xcite this led to a burst of investigations both experimental and theoretical , to understand the physical properties of such vortex matter.@xcite one interesting aspect concerning vortex matter is to determine the phase transition line of the melting between the vortex solid state and the vortex liquid state.@xcite several significant experiments@xcite have observed the phase transition of the melting between the vortex solid state and the vortex liquid state .",
    "in addition , magnetization jumps@xcite and specific heat spikes@xcite were observed , which indicate that the vortex lattice melting is a first - order phase transition .",
    "an often used theoretical description of the vortex lattice is the elastic theory,@xcite which is based on the lowest energy excitations on a perfect vortex lattice and can retain in fact most of the interesting physics . in the framework of elastic theory ,",
    "one uses a phenomenological criterion , lindemann criterion,@xcite to calculate the phase transition line .",
    "near @xmath1 vortices overlap and the elastic theory is questionable .",
    "furthermore for vortex liquid , the elastic theory is not applicable .",
    "another theoretical approach to study the phase transition in vortex matter is studying the thermal fluctuations of the more fundamental model , the ginzburg - landau(gl ) model.@xcite the model can describe very well both vortex lattice and vortex liquid in the region near @xmath1 .",
    "however , the full ginzburg - landau(gl ) theory is too complicated , and one needs to use some sort of approximations to advance the theoretical investigation . usually , the interested phase transition is located not far away from @xmath1 . near @xmath1 , it is well known that one can use the lowest landau level(lll ) approximation.@xcite a number of researchers had studied the vortex liquid phase.@xcite for solid phase , however , due to supersoft phonon modes , the perturbation theory was questioned .",
    "the problem was resolved by rosenstein@xcite and it was found that all infrared divergencies are canceled .",
    "non - perturbative gaussian variational calculation had been carried out.@xcite spinodal line was determined and recently was confirmed by experiments.@xcite by comparing the free energy of vortex liquid with vortex solid , the melting line had been obtained.@xcite the result was used to explain the melting transition of ybco type ( not too high anisotropy).@xcite recently it was also used to explain the melting transition in low @xmath1 materials.@xcite    while for highly anisotropic ones such as the bscco , the case is far more complicated .",
    "the relevant model for highly anisotropic superconductors is the lawrence - doniach - gl model(ldgl).@xcite .",
    "the ldgl model has been proposed to describe lhts with weak josephson interlayer coupling.@xcite however the full studying of this model is not tractable .",
    "we assume that we can start from an effective lll ldgl by integrating the higher landau level modes and focus our studies on this model .",
    "the phase diagram of the lll ldgl model had been investigated numerically in ref . , and",
    "the melting transition line was obtained .",
    "it is highly interesting if one can obtain the melting transition of the lll ldgl model analytically .",
    "however even for the lll ldgl , there is not a nonperturbative calculation of vortex liquid energy , therefore we have not yet determined the melting transition directly by comparing the liquid and solid free energy .",
    "therefore we come back to use more phenomenological criterions to determine the melting transition .",
    "we might use the lindemann criterion to study the melting transition , however unfortunately we do not know how to obtain the elastic modulii of the lawrence - doniach model and used them to obtain the melting transition .    in this paper",
    ", instead we will use another criterion to determine the transition , the debye - waller factor criterion ( dw criterion).@xcite based on this criterion , we will study analytically the model and the result will be compared * _ quantitatively _ * with the monte carlo(mc ) one in ref .",
    ", and the model will also be used to calculate the melting transition line in bscco .",
    "the debye - waller factor is the number of the original height of the second bragg peak ( thermal fluctuation not considered ) divided by the height of the second bragg peak with thermal fluctuation considered . due to thermal fluctuations",
    ", the debye - waller factor will be reduced .",
    "if the peak height is lowered to some extent , for example , 60% , the lattice will be melted .",
    "the applications of the dw criterion in both yukawa system@xcite and three dimensional ( 3d ) anisotropic case of the high-@xmath0 superconductors@xcite indicate that the criterion is quite accurate in determining the melting transition line . by using the dw criterion",
    ", we find that our calculations fit the result very well obtained by the mc simulation for studying the effective lll ld model .",
    "the analytic calculation of the melting transition line is compared reasonable well with experiment.@xcite we also stress that the calculations for the structure function and the debye - waller factor are fairly simple and straightforward .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is described and a perturbative mean - field solution is developed in section ii .",
    "then in section iii the structure function of the vortex lattice is calculated to one - loop .",
    "a melting criterion is discussed in section iv , comparison with mc simulations and experiment was also discussed in this section .",

    "far from @xmath9 ( this is the range of interest in this paper ) , the magnetic field is homogeneous due to the overlap of the vortices .",
