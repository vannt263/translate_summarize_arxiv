    "the paradigmatic taylor - couette ( tc ) flow has long been a flow configuration of great interest to fluid dynamicists .",
    "it consists of flow between two coaxial cylinders that can independently rotate , see figure  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "this system has been used extensively as a model in fluid physics because it is a closed system , has a relatively simple geometry and therefore has multiple symmetries .",
    "after early investigations @xcite , @xcite started studying turbulence in this system .",
    "for a further historical overview , the reader is referred to @xcite . for a review on tc flow at the onset of instabilities and slightly above , see @xcite .",
    "the state - of - the - art of high reynolds number taylor - couette turbulence is treated by ( @xcite ) .",
    "the two geometrical control parameters of tc flow are the ratio @xmath3 of the inner and outer cylinder radius and the aspect ratio @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the gap width and @xmath6 the height of the cylinders . in this work",
    "we use a small radius ratio of @xmath1 , corresponding to a relatively wide gap . the vast majority of existing work ( see overview by @xcite and review by @xcite ) focuses on a radius ratio of 0.71 or higher .",
    "lower @xmath3 experiments concern the rayleigh - stable regime @xcite , mean flow and turbulence characteristics @xcite and global torque measurements @xcite .",
    "in addition , numerical work has been done for @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the radius ratio is a key control parameter @xcite in tc flow and it has been found that a low radius ratio taylor - couette system behaves differently as compared to higher @xmath3 setups in several aspects , which will be outlined below .",
    "the underlying reason for the different behaviour is the strong boundary layer asymmetry .",
    "because the ratio of inner and outer boundary layer thicknesses scales as @xmath8 @xcite , a strong asymmetry between the inner and outer boundary layer exists for small radius ratio .    ]    as dimensionless control parameters of the system we use the ( negative ) rotation ratio @xmath9 and the taylor number @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the angular velocities of the inner and outer cylinder , @xmath12 are the inner and outer cylinder radii , @xmath13 is the radius ratio , and @xmath14 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the driving of the system can also be described by the shear reynolds number @xcite : @xmath15 for which @xmath16 .",
    "when increasing the driving strength ( i.e. the taylor number ) , tc flow first gradually undergoes a transition from a purely azimuthal , laminar state to a state where the bulk becomes turbulent while the boundary layers still remain laminar .",
    "the latter state is called the classical regime @xcite . by further increasing ta ,",
    "the ultimate regime @xcite is reached , in which also the boundary layers are turbulent .",
    "the signature of these turbulent boundary layers are logarithmic velocity profiles which have recently been found for a radius ratio of @xmath17 @xcite and for @xmath18 @xcite . @xcite",
    "have derived theoretical velocity profiles , and found that the angular velocity profile follows a log - law more closely than the azimuthal velocity profile , an effect that is more pronounced with the stronger asymmetry for smaller @xmath3 . in section [ subsec : azang ]",
    "we set out to investigate the correspondence of experimentally measured angular and azimuthal velocity profiles to a log - law for @xmath1 and taylor numbers up to @xmath0 at the onset of the ultimate turbulent regime .",
    "furthermore , the velocity profiles are compared to existing experimental and numerical work .",
    "in addition to affecting the velocity profiles , the radius ratio strongly influences the transitional taylor number for the ultimate regime @xcite . for @xmath7 the ultimate regime does not start before @xmath19 @xcite , whereas the transition for a higher radius ratio of @xmath2 already occurs at @xmath20 @xcite . very different",
    "scaling of the angular momentum transfer and the `` wind '' in the gap with the driving paramater ta exist for the classical and ultimate regime @xcite .",
    "the late onset of the ultimate regime for @xmath1 gives us the opportunity to analyze the scaling of the wind reynolds number with taylor numbers in the classical tc regime , up to the onset of the ultimate regime and compare it with theoretical predictions ( section [ subsec : rewind ] ) .",
    "another area where the influence of the radius ratio is apparent , is the angular momentum transport trough the gap .",
    "this transport is a key response parameter of the system and is directly connected to the torque required to maintain constant cylinder velocities @xcite .",
    "the radius ratio strongly influences the rotation ratio for which optimal momentum transport occurs @xcite . for example",
    ", the optimal momentum transport occurs at @xmath21 for @xmath22 @xcite whereas it is @xmath23 for @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "roll structures play an important role in the momentum transport in the taylor - couette system @xcite . with increasing taylor number",
    ", the system undergoes transitions from a purely laminar state to having steady , coherent taylor vortices , to having modulated , wavy taylor vortices which eventually evolve into chaotic turbulent taylor vortices @xcite .",
    "but even in the ultimate regime , for some @xmath24 , it was found that remnants of these rolls are present in time - averaged quantities @xcite , whereas for @xmath25 ( pure inner cylinder rotation ) these rolls vanish for large taylor number @xcite . in section [ subsec : rolls ]",
    "we will characterise the roll structures for @xmath1 at both pure inner cylinder rotation @xmath25 and slight counter - rotation @xmath26 , at which optimal transport occurs .",
    "it was recently proposed that the logarithmic velocity profiles in ultimate tc flow are triggered by turbulent plume ejection @xcite , which in turn is regulated by the relative strength of the axial and radial mean flow . using time - resolved azimuthal and radial velocity field measurements at several heights in the setup we will investigate the connection between the roll structures that generate strong radial and axial flow , and the turbulent plumes that emanate from either the inner or outer cylinder ( section [ subsec : plumes ] ) .",

    "the inner and outer cylinder radii are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , the height of the setup is @xmath29 .",
    "this gives a radius ratio of @xmath7 and an aspect ratio of @xmath30 .",
    "the cylindricities of the cylinders that were used are @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the inner and outer cylinder , respectively .",
    "the maximum rotation rates are 5 hz for both the inner and outer cylinder .",
    "the end plates rotate with the outer cylinder .",
    "the outer cylinder and the top plate are transparent , making the setup ideally suited to be used in combination with particle image velocimetry ( piv ) . a high - resolution piv camera ( lavision imager scmos ) with a resolution of 2560 @xmath33 2160 pixels and a frame rate of 50 hz is installed above the top end plate , pointing downwards .",
    "water is used at the working fluid ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "the water contains fluorescent particles ( dantec dynamics , pmma - rhb , 1 - 20 @xmath36 ) with a maximum stokes number of @xmath37 , which means that they faithfully follow the flow and can be considered as tracer particles .",
    "the flow is illuminated by a horizontal light sheet from a high - powered pulsed nd : ylf dual cavity laser ( litron ldy303he ) . because of the high - resolution piv camera , very high resolution measurements of the flow fields can be achieved . the imaging of the full width of the gap combined with a vector grid of 16 @xmath33 16 pixels with 50% overlap results in a velocity vector spacing of 0.13 mm . the piv system is operated in dual frame mode , allowing for an interframe time @xmath38 smaller than the inverse frame rate .",
    "the piv image pairs are processed using lavision davis software , after which the flow fields are transformed to the radial velocity @xmath39 and the azimuthal velocity @xmath40 .",
    "the parameter space that was explored for this work is shown in figure  [ fig : params ] .",
    "the first set of measurements that is treated here consists of varying the taylor number between @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( corresponding to a shear reynolds number of @xmath43 to @xmath44 ) for inner cylinder rotation only ( @xmath25 ) at mid - height ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "these measurements were performed as a single continuous experiment ; the cylinder velocity was increased slowly between experiments and before each measurement approximately 10 minutes were taken to give the flow ample time to stabilise .",

    "the highest taylor number we achieve in the present measurements is @xmath97 , which for @xmath1 with the higher transitional taylor number of @xmath19 @xcite implies that we are in the classical turbulent regime .",

    "the angular velocity @xmath62 resembles a log - law more closely , as suggested by @xcite , based on their navier - stokes based theoretical considerations .    because of the late onset of the ultimate regime for @xmath1 , the measurements with @xmath82 up to @xmath0 are in the classical turbulent regime . for the first time",
    "the wind reynolds number has been measured in the classical regime of taylor - couette flow and it indeed follows the theoretically predicted classical scaling of @xmath132 .    moreover , we focused on the interplay between rolls , turbulent plumes and logarithmic velocity profiles . at a strong driving of @xmath102",
    "no significant coherent structures exists for pure inner cylinder rotation , but roll structures appear for counter - rotation at @xmath133 .",
    "this behaviour has been observed previously for different values of @xmath3 and @xmath82 , and shows the important part that rolls play in momentum transfer between the two cylinders .    for inner cylinder rotation only ,",
    "strong outward plumes are visible in the radial velocity . in the azimuthal velocity ,",
    "the plumes mainly go inwards . the exact mechanism causing this difference is yet to be elucidated .",
    "for counter - rotation , the roll structures strongly influence the direction of the plumes .",
    "there is a direct correspondence between the direction of the mean radial flow and the direction of the plumes at a certain position .",
    "the plume velocity in the radial flow profiles increases with taylor number , and has an approximately constant value of one quarter of the inner cylinder velocity for pure inner cylinder rotation .",
    "lastly , by quantifying the correspondence of the angular velocity profiles to a log - law for several axial positions , it was found that in regions with strong radial flow away from a cylinder surface , plumes will emit from that cylinder , which in turn create logarithmic boundary layers .",
    "this work confirms predictions about velocity profiles and the scaling of the wind reynolds number and sheds new light on the characteristics and the role of plumes in taylor - couette flow for a radius ratio @xmath1 , and hopefully will spark further research into these intricate phenomena .",
    "we thank the technicians of the department of aerodynamics and fluid mechanics at the btu for their technical support . this work was financially supported by the european high - performance infrastructures in turbulence ( euhit ) , an european research council ( erc ) advanced grant , and the simon stevin prize of the technology foundation stw of the netherlands ."
