    "conventionally deep inelastic lepton - proton scattering is described in terms of scale - dependent parton distributions , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "these distributions correspond to the density of partons in the proton with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath10 , integrated over transverse momentum up to @xmath11 .",
    "they satisfy dglap evolution in @xmath12 .",
    "the kinematic region @xmath13 gives the leading @xmath14 approximation to deep inelastic scattering .    for less inclusive processes",
    "it is , however , necessary to consider distributions unintegrated over the transverse momentum @xmath1 of the parton .",
    "the unintegrated distributions have the advantage that they exactly correspond to the quantity which enters the feynman diagrams and therefore allow for the true kinematics of the process even at leading order ( lo ) .",
    "these distributions @xmath0 depend on two hard scales is integrated up to the scale @xmath15 . ] : @xmath1 and the scale @xmath15 of the probe .",
    "the scale @xmath15 plays a dual role . on the one hand it acts as the factorization scale , while on the other hand it controls the angular ordering of the partons emitted in the evolution @xcite .",
    "clearly it is desirable to also include @xmath16 bfkl - type contributions in the evolution .",
    "recall that both dglap and bfkl evolution are essentially equivalent to ordered evolution in the angles of the emitted partons ; on the other hand if , at one step of the evolution @xmath17 , then this contribution is included inside the nlo splitting function . ] . in the dglap collinear approximation the angle increases due to the growth of @xmath1 , while in bfkl the angle @xmath18 grows due to the decreasing longitudinal momentum fraction as we proceed along the emission chain from the proton .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath15 separates the partons associated with emission from different parts of the process , that is from the beam and target protons ( in @xmath19 collisions ) and from the hard subprocess .",
    "for example it separates emissions from the beam ( with polar angle @xmath20 ) from those from the target ( with @xmath21 ) , and from the intermediate partons from the hard subprocess .",
    "this separation was proved in ref .",
    "@xcite and originates from the destructive interference of the different emission amplitudes in the angular boundary regions .",
    "if the longitudinal momentum fraction is fixed by the hard subprocess , then the limits on the angles can be expressed in terms of a factorization scale @xmath15 which corresponds to the upper limit - channel parton may have @xmath1 up to @xmath22 , characteristic of bfkl effects , whereas for lo dglap the @xmath23 and @xmath24-channel partons are both limited by @xmath13 . of course",
    ", some @xmath25 contribution will arise from the nlo splitting functions . ] on the allowed values of the ( @xmath23-channel ) parton @xmath1 .",
    "since the parton distributions depend on two scales we potentially have to deal with complicated ( ccfm @xcite ) evolution equations for the @xmath0 functions .",
    "of course it is possible to work with two - scale distributions , but this is much more complicated @xcite and up to now has only proved practical with monte carlo generators @xcite .",
    "however , the evolution process is essentially controlled by one quantity , the emission angle , and on this basis we may expect to be able to obtain the distributions @xmath0 from single - scale evolution equations . therefore it should be possible to follow an analytic approach where the physical assumptions are much more evident and where , in principle , nlo corrections can be included . moreover , in practice , it is much easier to use the same unintegrated distributions to describe different hard processes and to perform global parton analyses .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "the key observation is that the @xmath15 dependence of the unintegrated distributions enters at the last step of the evolution , and so we may use single - scale evolution equations .",
    "the procedure is first described in section  2 in the case of pure dglap evolution , and then extended to include @xmath16 effects in section  3 . in the latter case we use the solution of a single - scale equation which unifies dglap and bfkl evolution @xcite , and perform a final evolution step which brings in the dependence on the second scale .",
    "@xcite also generated the two - scale unintegrated gluon from the same unified evolution equation , but with a different procedure of the unintegrated distributions and the value of the integrated distribution .",
    "@xcite takes the opposite approach ; that is , exact equality with the integrated distribution is imposed and as a result angular ordering of the bfkl contribution is not complete .",
    "the difference is a nlo effect . ] .",
    "the unintegrated gluons obtained using the procedures described in sections  2 , 3 and ref .",
    "@xcite are compared in section  4 . in section  5",
    "we describe how the structure function @xmath26 is calculated from the unintegrated parton distributions , and in section  6 we discuss the relationship between the unintegrated and integrated distributions . finally in section  7",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "it is informative to review how unintegrated distributions @xmath27 may be calculated from the conventional ( integrated ) parton densities , @xmath7 , in the case of pure dglap evolution .",
    "the procedure was explained in ref .",
    "we start from the dglap equation splitting we have to insert a factor @xmath28 in front of @xmath29 in the last integral of ( [ eq : a1 ] ) to account for the identity of the produced gluons . ]",
    "[ eq : a1 ] = where in the first term a sum over all possible parent partons @xmath30 is implied .",
    "this first term on the right - hand - side describes the number of partons @xmath31 emitted in the interval @xmath32 .",
    "such emission clearly changes the transverse momentum @xmath1 of the evolving parton . if we were to neglect the virtual contribution in ( [ eq : a1 ] ) , then the unintegrated parton density would be given simply by [ eq : a2 ] f_a ( x , k_t^2 ) & = & .",
    "|_^2 = k_t^2 + & & + & = & _ x^1 - p_aa^ ( z ) a^ ( , k_t^2 ) dz . the virtual contribution in ( [ eq : a1 ] ) does not change the parton @xmath1 and may be resummed to give the survival probability @xmath33 that parton @xmath34 with transverse momentum @xmath1 remains untouched in the evolution up to the factorization scale .",
    "the survival probability is given by [ eq : a3 ] t_a ( k_t , ) = ( -_k_t^2^^2 _ a^ _ 0 ^ 1 - p_a^a ( z^ ) dz^ ) ,  la sudakov form factor .",
    "thus the probability to find parton @xmath34 with transverse momentum @xmath1 ( which initiates a hard subprocess with factorization scale @xmath15 ) is [ eq : a4 ] f_a ( x , k_t^2 , ^2 ) = t_a ( k_t , ) .",
    "it is at this _",
    "last step of the evolution _ that the unintegrated distribution becomes dependent on the two scales , @xmath35 and @xmath12 .",
    "we now have to take care to specify the value of the infrared cut - off @xmath36 , which is introduced to protect the @xmath37 singularity in the splitting functions arising from soft gluon emission . in the original dglap equation , ( [ eq : a1 ] ) , which describes the evolution of the integrated distributions",
    ", this singularity is cancelled between the real emission and virtual contributions .",
    "however after the resummation of the virtual terms , the real soft gluon emission must be accounted for explicitly since it changes the @xmath1 of the parton .",
    "thus we have to find the physically appropriate choice of the cut - off @xmath36 to provide the angular ordering of the gluon emissions and @xmath38 are not singular at @xmath39 it is natural to use the same prescription for both the quark and the gluon distributions . ] .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the cut - off was taken to be @xmath40 . as a consequence",
    "the two - scale unintegrated distributions @xmath41 of @xcite vanish for @xmath25 , in accordance with the dglap strong ordering in @xmath1 .",
    "however we can do better and impose the more correct angular ordering in the last step of the evolution .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that this leads to a constraint on the scale @xmath15 , namely [ eq : a12 ] ( - ^ ) > z k_t/(1 - z ) . thus the maximum allowed value of the integration variable @xmath42 is [ eq : a5 ] z_max = and the corresponding cut - off @xmath43 .",
    "of course the same @xmath36 must be used both in the real emission integral in ( [ eq : a4 ] ) and in the survival probability @xmath44 in ( [ eq : a3 ] ) . )",
    ", @xmath45 is the appropriate cut - off for @xmath46 .",
    "] in fact we shall see that the imposition of angular ordering at the last step of the evolution leads to physically reasonable parton @xmath1 distributions which extend smoothly into the domain @xmath25 .",
    "we wish to generalize the above method to include the leading @xmath16 contributions . clearly there can be different forms of the ` unified ' evolution equation summing up the leading dglap and bfkl logarithms , where the ambiguity is at the subleading level .",
    "the aim is to find a good prescription which is not too complicated , but which can account for all the physically relevant kinematic effects just at lo level . in other words",
    "we seek an equation which sums up the major part of the subleading corrections in a lo framework .",
    "let us consider , for the moment , just the gluon distribution .",
    "recall that the unintegrated distribution @xmath47 depends on two scales . as in the pure dglap case of section",
    "2 we wish to work in terms of a single - scale evolution equation , and then to restore the scale @xmath15 , and the full kinematics , at the last step of the evolution .",
    "this is illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig : laststep ] .",
    "for an analysis which incorporates bfkl effects , the appropriate single - scale distribution is the auxiliary function [ eq : a6 ] h ( x , k_t^2 ) = . note that @xmath48 is precisely the function which satisfies the bfkl equation in the low @xmath10 limit .",
    "both bfkl and dglap evolution correspond to angular ordering of the emission angles , and are single - scale equations . at lo ,",
    "strong angular ordering automatically comes either from strong ordering in @xmath10 ( @xmath49 ) for bfkl or from strong @xmath1 ordering @xmath50 for dglap . for the unintegrated gluon ,",
    "we face a problem when @xmath51 in the dglap framework , and similarly we have a problem when @xmath52 for bfkl .",

    "@xcite , we first neglect the subleading @xmath51 and @xmath52 effects to obtain and solve a unified bfkl / dglap equation for @xmath48 .",
    "then , in the last step of the evolution , we take account of the precise kinematics so that the @xmath51 and @xmath52 domains are treated correctly .    the unified equation for @xmath53 , which closely follows that presented in ref .",

    "the integrated input distributions @xmath66 are not known and , as usual , must be determined from the data or from some non - perturbative qcd model .",
    "we emphasize that in the unified bfkl / dglap equation we choose the scale @xmath15 to be @xmath1 for the dglap contribution , to be consistent with the bfkl term ( which is independent of @xmath15 at lo ) .",
    "recall that angular ordering leads to a redefinition of the scale @xcite @xmath67 if this modified scale were to be adopted then it would be impossible to obtain a simple one - scale unified evolution equation throughout the whole @xmath68 domain . on the other hand , within the lo framework , we may omit the @xmath42 dependence in the scale , so that the dglap part of the evolution becomes ordered in transverse momenta .",
    "we stress again that it is sufficient to implement the precise constraints coming from angular ordering ( relevant to the @xmath69 and 1 domains for the bfkl and dglap terms respectively ) at the last step of the evolution .",
    "an advantage of the single - scale unified bfkl / dglap equation is that it is straightforward to incorporate a major ( kinematical ) part of the subleading order @xmath16 ( bfkl ) effects , brings the bfkl approach back under control , see also @xcite . ] by imposing a consistency condition to ensure that the virtuality of the exchanged gluon is dominated by its transverse momentum squared @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by the inclusion of the theta function @xmath70 in the real emission contribution shown in the last term of ( [ eq : a7 ] ) .",
    "note that other subleading effects arising from using the complete dglap splitting function and running @xmath71 are automatically included in the unified equation .",
    "we see that the evolution equations for the auxiliary distributions @xmath72",
    "depend on the single scale @xmath35 .",
    "the dependence of the unintegrated distributions @xmath0 on the second scale @xmath15 will enter when we consider the _ last step of the evolution_. it is sufficient to ensure that the final emitted parton explicitly satisfies the requirements of angular ordering .",
    "the angular ordering conditions of the previous steps of the evolution are automatically ensured at lo by virtue of either the strong ordering in @xmath1 ( in the dglap part ) or the strong ordering in @xmath42 ( in the bfkl part ) .    to ensure angular ordering in the last step of the evolution ,",
    "we note that @xmath42 is limited by ( [ eq : a12 ] ) .",

    "after the virtual contributions are resummed into the @xmath33 factors the unintegrated parton distributions remain positive everywhere .",

[ fig : fourq2 ] sample results results obtained using the unintegrated distributions evaluated from ( [ eq : a4 ] ) with the mrst99 partons @xcite , that is , version ( b ) of @xmath92 and @xmath93 as discussed in section  4 . ] , shown by the continuous curves , are compared with deep - inelastic structure function data . the gluon and quark components are shown by the dashed and dotted curves respectively . as expected the dominant contribution at small @xmath10 comes from the unintegrated gluon via the quark box and crossed - box contributions , whereas at large @xmath10 the quark terms dominate .",
    "we emphasize that , in the present work , the curves for @xmath26 are not the result of a fit to the structure function data . rather they have been obtained by using single - scale functions , originally fitted more directly to @xmath26 data , as plausible input to our ` last - step ' evolution procedure , which generates two - scale unintegrated distributions @xmath0 .",
    "then we use the unintegrated distributions to compute @xmath26 via ( [ eq : a18 ] ) , ( [ eq : a25 ] ) and ( [ eq : a26 ] ) . for the inclusive observable @xmath26 , we would expect that the insertion of this extra evolution step would not appreciably disturb the description , since it essentially redistributes the distributions in @xmath1 space .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : fourq2 ] that indeed this is the case .",
    "it is important to scrutinise the relationship between the new unintegrated partons @xmath41 and the conventional integrated parton distributions @xmath130 , as obtained in global analyses such as @xcite .",
    "first we emphasize that we may use either the integrated distributions or the unintegrated distributions to describe both inclusive ( like @xmath26 ) and exclusive processes .",
    "the framework based on the unintegrated distributions is a bit more complicated .",
    "however it accounts for the precise kinematics of the process and an important part of the virtual loop corrections , via the survival factor @xmath44 , even at lo .",
    "on the other hand , if we work with integrated partons we have to include nlo ( and sometimes nnlo ) contributions to account for these effects .",
    "these differences appear to cause a discrepancy between the integrated and unintegrated approaches . as we explain below ,",
    "this is to be expected since it arises from simplifications of the lo formalism due to the neglect of terms which are moved into the nlo contribution .",
    "an important equation , sometimes cited as the defining property of unintegrated partons @xcite , is @xmath131 where @xmath34 represents @xmath132 or @xmath9 .",
    "this is in fact the first equation of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the bfkl limit , the @xmath15 dependence of @xmath133 vanishes and we have @xmath134 as in ( [ eq : a16 ] ) . in this case ,",
    "( [ eq : intofunint ] ) is clearly satisfied .",
    "however , in general the situation is complicated by the two separate momentum scales @xmath1 and @xmath15 .",
    "the unintegrated partons @xmath92 of ref .",
    "@xcite were explicitly constructed to have the property ( [ eq : intofunint ] ) , in the sense that the integral of @xmath92 over the transverse momentum up to the scale @xmath15 would be the same as the integral of the input auxiliary function @xmath115 up to the same scale .",
    "in contrast , numerical integration over @xmath1 of the new unintegrated partons @xmath92 and @xmath93 presented in this paper ( both versions ( a ) and ( b ) of section  4 ) shows that ( [ eq : intofunint ] ) is only approximately true . ) as it is written , because we can only define the unintegrated function in the regime of perturbative @xmath114 .",
    "the comparison that is made is between the integral from @xmath135 to @xmath12 and the quantity @xmath136 .",
    "] we typically find a discrepancy of order 25% between the right - hand side of ( [ eq : intofunint ] ) and the single - scale distribution that has been used to generate @xmath91 .    in order to eliminate the discrepancy we may adjust the upper limit @xmath12 of the integral in ( [ eq : intofunint ] ) to @xmath137 .",
    "the introduction of @xmath105 is equivalent to a nlo correction for the integrated partons .",
    "typically in the `` dglap '' case ( approach ( b ) of section  4 ) we require @xmath138 to reproduce the original mrst integrated gluon in the domain @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( and @xmath141 for approach ( a ) , which embodies bfkl effects ) .",
    "a value @xmath142 compensates for the over - large virtual loop correction included in the integrated dglap partons on account of the absence of the cut - off @xmath36 in the integral over @xmath46 . at smaller values of @xmath10 the corrections due to the cut - off",
    "are mainly cancelled between the virtual and real dglap contributions . as @xmath10 increases , the virtual contribution ( the second term on the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : a1 ] ) ) increasingly dominates and we have to choose smaller values of @xmath105 . eventually in the domain @xmath143 , @xmath144 the main contribution comes from the input and to compensate the absence of",
    "the @xmath42 cut - off in the conventional form of the dglap equation we must change the input itself .    to summarize , the discrepancy between the integral ( [ eq : intofunint ] ) of the unintegrated parton function and the original integrated distribution is not a cause for concern .",
    "conceptually , there are two different roles for single - scale distributions in the description of data for inclusive observables ( where partonic transverse momentum is integrated out ) .",
    "the first role is the traditional one , in the framework of collinear factorization , whereby integrated parton distribution functions are fitted directly to the data . the second role is demonstrated in this paper ( following @xcite and @xcite ) , where we use single - scale functions as _ input _ to the last - step procedure , see for example ( [ eq : a4 ] ) .",
    "we have been forced to introduce a new formalism for calculating @xmath145 , in which unintegrated parton functions are understood to be the fundamental objects ; we have emphasized the need to perform a new global fit to data in terms of the new functions @xmath91 .",
    "after this , we do not expect the input single - scale function @xmath34 on the left - hand side of ( [ eq : intofunint ] ) to equal the integral of @xmath91 up to @xmath12 , since @xmath34 itself is not fitted directly to the data , but rather is used as input for the last step of the evolution , which embodies a crucial angular - ordering constraint unique to this last step .",
    "thus our single - scale or ` auxiliary ' function is not a traditional parton distribution function , but simply an intermediate function .",
    "parton distributions , @xmath0 unintegrated over the parton @xmath1 are the basic quantities for describing processes initiated by hadrons .",
    "an essential ingredient in this description is the existence of the @xmath1 factorization theorem @xcite .",
    "the unintegrated distributions depend on two hard scales  the transverse momentum @xmath1 and the factorization scale @xmath15 .",
    "the scale @xmath15 drives the angular ordering during the evolution which arises from the coherence of the gluon emissions .",
    "here we develop a new formalism to determine the unintegrated parton distributions , @xmath0 , which embodies both the leading @xmath146 ( dglap ) and @xmath147 ( bfkl ) effects , as well as including a major part of the sub - leading @xmath147 contributions .",
    "an important observation is that , at leading order , the _ two - scale _ functions @xmath0 may be calculated from auxiliary functions @xmath2 which satisfy _ single - scale _ evolution equations , since the angular ordering restrictions , controlled by @xmath15 , become important only at the last step of the evolution .",
    "the equation for the auxiliary function @xmath80 was formulated , and the distributions fitted to the data , in ref .",
    "these single - scale equations were also devised to include all the leading @xmath148 and @xmath149 contributions , and a major part of the sub - leading @xmath147 effects .    in other words ,",
    "the ` unified ' evolution equations for @xmath150 must be supplemented by a final evolution step in which the @xmath15 dependence of the unintegrated parton distributions enters via the angular - ordering constraint .",
    "the situation is summarised diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : laststep ] .",
    "the procedure offers a considerable simplification in the determination of physically realistic unintegrated parton distributions @xmath0 over the full @xmath151 perturbative domain , including the true kinematics even at leading order .",
    "as expected , the gluon and sea quark distributions extend into the @xmath87 region more and more as @xmath10 decreases .",
    "we have compared the new unintegrated distributions with those given by previous prescriptions @xcite . as compared to ref .",
    "@xcite , the new formalism gives a consistent treatment of angular ordering , which leads to the imposition of the @xmath42 integration limit @xmath73 . as a consequence",
    "the distributions @xmath0 decrease faster than those of @xcite for large @xmath1 , particularly at small @xmath10 .",
    "an interesting result is that the unintegrated distributions obtained via @xmath2 of @xcite are not very different from those obtained via ( [ eq : a4 ] ) using conventional dglap partons  compare the continuous and dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : unint ] .",
    "it thus appears that the imposition of the angular - ordering constraint is more important than the bfkl effects .",
    "this observation has the practical consequence that reasonably accurate predictions for observables can be made using the much simpler , though less complete , prescription of ( [ eq : a4 ] ) .",
    "finally , we used the new unintegrated distributions to calculate the deep - inelastic structure function @xmath26 .",
    "we also showed the gluon - initiated and quark contributions separately , which , as expected , dominate at small @xmath10 and large @xmath10 respectively .",
    "recall , from @xcite , that the rise of the gluon at small @xmath10 is driven by perturbative qcd , which was assumed to have a non - perturbative input which is ` flat ' in @xmath10 .",
    "we emphasize that we have not fitted to the deep inelastic data .",
    "nevertheless , fig .",
    "[ fig : fourq2 ] shows that the existing distributions give an adequate description , and therefore they may be used to evaluate other hard processes , such as @xmath152 and large @xmath153 prompt photon production in high energy @xmath154 ( or @xmath19 ) collisions .",
    "it is important to use unintegrated distributions for such exclusive reactions .",
