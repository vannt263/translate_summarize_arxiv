    "worst - case robust approach is used commonly .",
    "the worst case robust beamforming has been well presented in @xcite for basic multiple antenna system with only simple power constraints .",
    "the robust formulation in @xcite and @xcite has redesigned respectively the distributed beamforming problems of @xcite and @xcite by worst - case approach , which demonstrates visible performance improvement with respect to the non - robust systems when the channels are perturbed .",

    "+    the approach in @xcite used a conservative approximation for sinr constraints , min over max ( mom ) , to avoid semi - infinite programming ( sip ) appeared due to the uncertainty region in the qos constraints of the robust problem .",

    "in fact , the problem is a sip @xcite .",
    "since sip have some solutions @xcite , but computationally complex , it is preferred to avoid these problems by converting them to another standard form . to simplify the sip robust problem  ,",
