    "galactic winds @xcite can carry gas , metals , and dust from a galaxy to its halo , deplete the future fuel for star formation , and inject energy and momentum into the inter- and circum - galactic medium .",
    "winds seen in neutral gas via absorption lines are a near - ubiquitous feature of star - forming galaxies @xcite . in galaxies with strong active galactic nuclei ( agn )",
    ", there is also evidence for widespread molecular winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with suggestions of a correlation between agn strength and the amount of outflowing material @xcite .",
    "there is also evidence for molecular outflows , or at least material blown out of the disk , in galaxies dominated by star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the number of very powerful star formation - driven molecular winds remains substantially lower than the set of molecular winds believed to be driven by agn .",
    "an excellent prospect to build a large sample of star formation - driven molecular winds comes from a result by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c11 ) based on observations of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) by @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed co emission from 29 ulirgs using the wide - bandwidth redshift search receiver instrument , at the time mounted on the 14-m five colleges radio astronomy observatory .",
    "c11 stacked this sample into a single high signal - to - noise spectrum and noted that this spectrum showed very wide ( @xmath1  km  s@xmath0 ) , line wings that accounted for , on average , @xmath2 of the total co emission from the galaxy .",
    "this is exactly the sort of signal expected from a powerful outflow of molecular gas from a moderately inclined galaxy .",
    "it resembles the signatures seen in individual sources like ngc 1266 @xcite , mrk 231 @xcite , and the @xcite sample of galaxies .",
    "the result of c11 is especially interesting because they showed that the stacked signal appeared to come preferentially from galaxies whose spectroscopic classification was either `` starburst '' or `` region '' rather than seyfert or liner .",
    "thus , the c11 sample offers one of the best prospects for building a sample of powerful molecular winds driven primarily by star formation .",
    "based on the claim by c11 , during the summer of 2014 we used the iram plateau de bure interferometer to observe four members of the c11 starburst/ subsample .",
    "we targeted iras05083 + 7936 ( i05083 ) , iras10035 + 4852 ( i100035 ) , iras17132 + 5313 ( i17132 ) , and iras17208 - 0014 ( i17208 ) , which c11 classified as bright ( i05083 , i17208 ) or intermediate ( i100035 , i17132 ) in co flux .",
    "table [ tab : source ] lists these targets and their basic physical parameters .",
    "we observed each target in the pdbi s most compact configuration for one track ( @xmath3 hours on source ) , targeting the @xmath4co ( 1 - 0 ) line using the widex correlator in its maximum bandwidth configuration .",
    "the resulting data have synthesized beams of @xmath5 ( i05083 ) , @xmath6 ( i10035 ) , @xmath7 ( i17132 ) , and @xmath8 ( i17208 ) and noise of 0.9 ( i05083 ) , 1.4 ( i10035 ) , 0.9 ( i17132 ) , and 1.5 ( i17132 )  mjy  beam@xmath0 .",
    "the data were imaged and deconvolved with a channel width of 25  km  s@xmath0 following standard procedures in gildas . before any other analysis",
    ", we subtracted the continuum in the image plane using line free channels to either side of the co line and not including the region of the cn lines , which are the only other bright lines in our bandpass .",
    "the peak 3 mm continuum flux density in our targets is @xmath9  mjy  beam@xmath0 ( i05083 ) , @xmath10  mjy  beam@xmath0 ( 5@xmath11 , i10035 ) , and @xmath12  mjy  beam@xmath0 ( 17132 ) , @xmath13  mjy  beam@xmath0 ( i17208 ) . for i05083 and i1713 ,",
    "these are consistent with a synchrotron spectral index and the fluxes of a few mjy measured at 33  ghz @xcite . for i17208 , the 6",
    "mjy flux is slightly lower than the @xmath14  mjy measured at 85  ghz by @xcite , but consistent within likely calibration uncertainties , especially if the emission has a synchrotron spectral index .",
    "a few residual sidelobes remain present in channels containing the main co line for the two brightest targets ( i05083 and i17208 ; see the peak intensity maps in figure [ fig : maps ] ) .",
    "these could be removed with more aggressive cleaning but do not matter to the results of this paper .",
    "the bright line is already almost entirely cleaned and we search for line wings in channels away from the main line , where these sidelobes are not present .",
    "the dynamic range in the images is still very high , 350 in the highest case ( i05083 ) .    in this most compact configuration",
    ", the pdbi is expected to resolve out sources larger than about 15@xmath15 in an individual channel .",
    "this is much larger than the visible extent of any of our targets and the corresponding physical distance ( @xmath16  kpc ) is larger than the extent of any known molecular outflows at a fixed velocity @xcite . in our observations",
    "we find 96 , 93 , 82 , and 130% of the flux in the c11 fcrao spectrum and the spectral shapes match well for the bright part of the line ( see below ) .",
    "given this good match to the single dish data and the large distance to our sources ( so that even large physical scales are compact on the sky ; @xmath17  kpc ) , we do not expect spatial filtering by the interferometer to be an important consideration for this work .    to calculate co luminosities and sizes ,",

    "we integrate fluxes over the range @xmath52  km  s@xmath0 around the nominal redshift , report the width of co emission at 20% of its peak value ( indicated by the dashed lines in figure [ fig : spectra ] ) , and convert the line flux to a luminosity using the distances described above .",
    "the line widths are reasonable for massive disks , @xmath53@xmath54  km  s@xmath0 , and comparable to other ulirgs ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "gradients , which are most naturally interpreted as signatures of rotation , are clearly visible in the velocity field maps , though with @xmath55  kpc resolution , we only marginally resolve each target .",
    "the luminosities are typical of ulirgs and consistent with previous measurements ( see above ) .",
    "the goal of our observations was to search for the presence of faint line wings .",
    "such wings are not immediately apparent from the images and position - velocity diagrams in figure [ fig : maps ] .",
    "to search more rigorously , we collapse each cube into a single spectrum , integrating over the region of interest indicated in figure [ fig : maps ] .",
    "we show these spectra in figure [ fig : spectra ] and report their properties in table [ tab : obs ] . for each spectrum , we plot two views : a version showing the full line at 25  km  s@xmath0 resolution and a version at 50  km  s@xmath0 resolution zoomed in to a @xmath56-axis range @xmath57 times the rms noise in the spectrum .",
    "the velocity scale in each spectrum is relative to the nominal redshift of the source ( the slight offset of iras05083 from zero indicates that our adopted redshift for the observations was slight off from the true redshift of the galaxy ) .",
    "each source shows broad , bright lines but our observations do not suggest the presence of the wide , faint component seen by c11 . in their stacked spectrum ,",
    "the line wings have average magnitude @xmath58 of the peak of the spectrum and contribute @xmath59 of the total co flux . in each of our individual targets ,",
    "a wide component 10% at 10% of the peak would be several sigma in each @xmath60  km  s@xmath0 channel and extend across @xmath61 channels .",
    "such a signal is clearly not present in our data .",
    "if the line wings claimed by c11 are real , then they may be present in the other 10 targets that contribute to their stack of star forming galaxies .",
    "however , we can confidently reject the signal in four of the brightest members of this sample .",
    "columns 6 and 7 of table [ tab : obs ] quantify the flux in faint line wings in our targets .",
    "we report the integrated flux in the spectrum that is within @xmath62  km  s@xmath0 of the nominal redshift of the source but outside the velocity range where the main line is @xmath63 of its peak amplitude .",
    "this region appears as the gray area in figure [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "we report the flux in this velocity range ( column 6 ) and express this as fraction of the total line flux ( column 7 ) .",
    "only a few percent of the flux in our targets emerges from faint line wings , in stark contrast to the results found for a larger sample by c11 . in section [ sec :",
    "disc ] , we discuss this flux in line wings in terms of h@xmath64 mass and mass outflow rate .",
    "we explore the contrast with c11 more directly in figure [ fig : stacks ] .",
    "the right panel shows a direct comparison between the spectra from c11 and the pdbi . for the bright part of the line in individual sources ,",
    "the two telescopes agree quite well in both amplitude and line shape . in the left panel ,",
    "we plot the stacked pdbi spectra for our four targets .",
    "we follow a procedure similar to c11 : we first smooth the spectrum to a resolution of 125  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "then we identify the peak of the spectrum .",
    "we renormalize the peak amplitude of spectrum to unity and recenter the velocity axis so that the peak lies at zero velocity .",
    "we grid the spectra onto a grid centered at zero with channels 125  km  s@xmath0 wide .",
    "then we coadd all four spectra to produce the averages .",
    "we carry out the same procedure for both the pdbi spectra and the fcrao spectra .",
    "we plot both stacks in the left panel of figure [ fig : stacks ] and show the difference of the two stacks in the bottom panel .",
    "note that the asymmetric frequency coverage around the line in the fcrao spectrum leads to variable noise across the velocity range .",
    "the averaged fcrao spectrum for our four targets shows a broad ( @xmath65  km  s@xmath0 ) component with intensity about 10% of the peak value .",
    "this closely resembles the stacked signal presented for 14 galaxies by c11 .",
    "that is , the stacked fcrao spectrum for only our four targets does appear consistent with the claim of c11 for their entire star - forming sample .",
    "by contrast , the stack of the pdbi spectra do not show such a feature , so that the residual fcrao minus pdbi plot in the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : stacks ] shows a signal that resembles the c11 claim near zero velocity .",
    "rigorously , we can only say that our observations disagree with the @xcite spectra regarding faint co wings for these four targets .",
    "we can not rule out the presence of very bright , broad line wings in the other 10 targets .",
    "however given the disagreement for our four present targets we believe the current observations cast some doubt on the broader c11 claim .",
    "one possible explanation could be that baseline issues with the single dish telescope ( which affect interferometers less ) created a spurious signal in the single dish stack and that bad luck lead this signal to not appear in c11 s carefully constructed control samples .      though we do not find a high - flux extended component , in both i05083 and i17208 we do detect line wings containing at most a few percent of the flux of the main line at marginal significance .",
    "these are visible in figure [ fig : spectra ] and in the integrated line wing fluxes presented in table [ tab : obs ] . using higher spatial resolution observations ,",
    "iras17208 has recently been demonstrated to have co outflow @xcite and the magnitude and velocity of the outflowing co emission in their data ( @xmath66-@xmath67  km  s@xmath0 and a few mjy ) is consistent with the faint emission in our spectrum ) . to our knowledge , i05083 ( vii zw 31 ) , does not have a previous measurement of faint line wings .",
    "higher resolution observations will be needed to localize the high velocity emission relative to the rotation curve and test whether the wings indeed reflect a co outflow .",
    "we fail to detect the line wings claimed by c11 , which account for @xmath59 of the total line flux . instead",
    ", we constrain the flux in faint line wings in our targets to be at most a few percent . how do these results , and the claim of c11 , compare with the results of the molecular outflow population analysis in @xcite ?",
    "qualitatively , that paper argued that high mass loading factors ( defined as @xmath68 , see below ) correlate to high contributions of agn to the bolometric luminosity , @xmath69 . in order to compare the various results",
    ", we adopt the formalism and data compilation from @xcite .",
    "they assume a continuous outflow and calculate the mass outflow rate via    @xmath70    with @xmath71 the mean velocity of outflowing material , @xmath72 the mass associated with the outflow , and @xmath73 the extent of the outflow . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "this geometry is likely to yield a high estimate for @xmath74 and we suggest that the reader bear this potential bias in mind .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that by adopting it , we can make quantitative comparative statements between our measurements and the @xcite `` extended sample . ''",
    "we do not have an outflow extent for any of our targets or the c11 sample and so adopt the median @xmath75  pc from the extended sample of @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the @xmath76  pc that they use for upper limits . for our targets ,",
    "we adopt @xmath77  km  s@xmath0 , approximately the @xmath78 velocity for a 1000  km  s@xmath0 line width .",
    "the same rms velocity is a good description for the faint wings in i05083 . for the c11 stack ,",
    "we adopt @xmath79  km  s@xmath0 , half of the full extent of their lines , an a reasonable average velocity .",
    "we convert from luminosity to @xmath72 using a @xcite conversion factor of @xmath80  , again largely adopted for consistency .",
    "this implies @xmath81@xmath82  m@xmath83 for our targets .",
    "we treat the measured fluxes for i05083 and i17208 as upper limits on @xmath72 , reflecting the uncertainty in identifying them as more than outflow candidates based on lower resolution spectra . using this approach",
    "our targets have @xmath84@xmath82  m@xmath83 , which is similar to the typical molecular mass for one of the @xcite outflows . for",
    "the c11 targets we take the average luminosity of the starburst subsample and the stacked result of 25% of the flux in the broad line .",
    "this yields an average @xmath85  m@xmath83 .",
    "we calculate star formation rates from ir luminosity using the same formula as @xcite for consistency . for the c11 stack ,",
    "we adopt @xmath86  m@xmath83  yr@xmath0 , corresponding to a typical total ir luminosity of @xmath87  l@xmath88 .",
    "table [ tab : source ] gives agn fractions or limits for our targets , though we note that these are highly uncertain .",
    "we will discuss c11 s starburst sample in terms of an upper limit of @xmath89 .    following this approach ,",
    "our sources have upper limits @xmath90@xmath38  m@xmath83  yr@xmath0 , which is @xmath91@xmath92 times the star formation rate . for the c11 sample ,",
    "the implied average outflow rate is @xmath93  m@xmath83  yr@xmath0 in the @xcite formalism , which is @xmath94 times the sfr of an average individual target .",
    "as emphasized , the absolute values of these numbers is very approximate .",
    "comparative measurements offer more insight and to this end we plot the results of these calculations along with the @xcite extended sample in figure [ fig : mdot ] .",
    "the left panel compares the mass outflow rate to star formation rate , so that diagonal lines correspond to mass loading factors ( @xmath74/sfr ) .",
    "the right panel compares the mass loading factor to the fraction of luminosity in the system supplied by an agn . in both panels ,",
    "blue points show galaxies spectroscopically classified as an agn and red points show starburst ( `` hii '' ) systems .",
    "the three samples appear as different symbols .    considering only our points and @xcite ( i.e. , leaving aside c11 )",
    ", the two plots reinforce the conclusion that mass loading factors above @xmath95 are only achieved in systems with a strong agn contribution .",
    "the exact mass loading factors , especially for the star forming systems , may be slightly higher than the values shown  for consistency all points here assume the same @xmath80  .",
    "the geometry may also vary , with poor resolution and inclination effects potentially hiding some outflows . nonetheless , the data suggest that star formation appears to produce mass loading factors of up to a few , rather than @xmath95@xmath96 . though we note the lack of a large set of high star formation rate , sfr - dominated targets . by contrast",
    ", the @xmath74 suggested on average by c11 imply a mass loading factor of @xmath97 for their stack of starburst galaxies .",
    "this would be as high as the strongest agn in the @xcite extended sample .",
    "the calculations leading to figure [ fig : mdot ] require a large number of assumptions , but the figures still summarize the results of this paper .",
    "we follow up a claim of extended , high - flux line wings in starburst galaxies by c11 . if present",
    ", these line wings would imply high mass loading factors in star - formation dominated system , as high as those seen in extreme agn - dominated systems .",
    "we fail to find such features in 4 of the 14 galaxies presented by c11 .",
    "instead we limit the flux in such an extended spectral component to less than a few percent .",
    "we show that the stacked c11 signal is present in their data for our targets but not in the @xmath95 times more sensitive pdbi observations .",
    "two of our targets do show marginally significant flux in an extended line wing : i17208 is known to have an outflow ( likely driven by a hidden agn * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we identify the other , i05083 ( vii zw 31 ) , as a candidate molecular outflow . combining these results with the @xcite extended sample , our observations of high sfr , star - formation dominated systems",
    "reinforce the idea that high mass loading factors tend to arise in systems where agn contribute a large fraction of the luminosity .",
    "in addition to follow - up on our candidate outflow , sensitive observations of a large set of star - formation dominated high sfr systems will be useful to further test this conclusion .",

    "<S> we report the results of a search for large velocity width , low - intensity line wings  a commonly used signature of molecular outflows  in four low redshift ( ultra)luminous infrared galaxies ( u / lirgs ) that appear to be dominated by star formation . </S>",
