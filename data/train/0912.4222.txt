    "the cast ( cern axion solar telescope ) experiment is using a decommissioned lhc dipole magnet to convert solar axions into detectable x - ray photons .",
    "axions are light pseudoscalar particles that arise in the context of the peccei - quinn@xcite solution to the strong cp problem and can be dark matter candidates@xcite .",
    "stars could produce axions via the primakoff conversion of the plasma photons .",
    "the cast experiment is pointing at our closest star , the sun , aiming to detect solar axions .",
    "the detection principle is based on the coupling of an incoming axion to a virtual photon provided by the transverse field of an intense dipole magnet , being transformed into a real , detectable photon that carries the energy and the momentum of the original axion .",
    "the axion to photon conversion probability is proportional to the square of the transverse field of the magnet and to the active length of the magnet . using an lhc magnet ( @xmath7 t and @xmath8 m long ) improves the sensitivity by a factor 100 compared to previous experiments .",
    "the cast experiment has been taking data since 2003 providing the most restrictive limits on the axion - photon coupling  @xcite for masses @xmath9ev . at this mass the sensitivity is degraded due to coherence loss . in order to restore coherence , the magnet can be filled with a buffer gas providing an effective mass to the photon@xcite . by changing the pressure of the buffer gas in steps , one can scan an entire range of axion mass values .",
    "at the end of 2005 the cast experiment started such a program , entering its phase ii by filling the magnet bore with he gas . from 2005 to 2007 , the magnet bore was filled with @xmath10 gas extending our sensitivity to masses up to @xmath11ev , final results will be presented here . from march 2008",
    "onwards the magnet bore has been filled with @xmath12 and the sensitivity should be increased to sensivities up to @xmath13ev by the end of the @xmath12 run in 2010 .",
    "the cast set up has been described elsewhere  @xcite . from 2002 to 2006",
    "three x - ray detectors were mounted on the two sides of the magnet : a conventional tpc@xcite covering both magnet bores looking for sunset axions ; in the sunrise side one of the bores was covered by a micromegas detector@xcite and in the other bore a ccd detector coupled to a telescope@xcite improving the signal to background ratio by a factor 150 . in 2006",
    "the tpc started to show a degraded performance due to aging .",
    "it was then decided to replace the sunset tpc and the existing micromegas detector in the sunrise side by a new generation of micromegas detectors@xcite that coupled with suitable shielding would improve greatly their performance .",
    "the new detectors were commissioning end of 2007 and by mid 2008 they have already shown an improvement in performance that has been translated in a background reduction of a factor 15 compared to the tpc performances and a factor 3 compared to the standard micromegas detector used without shielding till 2006 .",
    "the ccd detector will also be upgraded by the fall 2009 by a new detector with improved performance : better low energy response , lower intrinsic background by using more radio - pure materials and less out of time events .    in 2005 ,",
    "the experiment went through a major upgrade to allow operation with he buffer gas in the cold bore .",
    "this upgrade was done in two steps : first the system was designed for operation using @xmath10 and in 2007 the system was upgraded for operation at higher buffer gas densities using @xmath12 .",
    "the system has been designed to control the injection of he in the magnet bores with precision and to monitor accurately the gas pressure and temperature@xcite .",
    "special care has been taken to achieve high precision in the reproducibility of steps ( @xmath14 mbar ) and to protect the system for @xmath12 loss .",
    "the @xmath12 system has been operating succesfully since december 2007 .",
    "as during phase i , the tracking data ( magnet pointing the sun ) represented about 2@xmath151.5 hours per day while the rest of the day was used to measure background .",
    "the procedure was to daily increase the @xmath10 density so that sunrise and sunset detectors measure every pressure .",
    "every specific pressure of the gas allows to test a specific axion mass having a new discovery potential .",
    "the @xmath10 data recorded end of 2005 and 2006 represents around 300 hours of tracking data and 10 times more hours of background data for each detector , covering 160 pressure settings allowing to scan a new axion mass range between 0.02 and 0.39  ev .",
    "an independent analysis was performed for each data set of the three different detectors .",
    "a combined preliminary result was derived where from the absence of a signal above background cast excludes a new range in the @xmath16@xmath1  plane shown in figure  [ fig : exclusion ] from axion masses of 0.02ev ( phase i ) up to masses of 0.39ev .",
    "this parameter space was not previously explored in laboratory experiments .",
    "cast has therefore entered the qcd axion band for the first time in this range of axion masses , excluding an important portion of the axion parameter space .",
    "the final results have been published in @xcite .",
    "the collaboration has performed by - product analysis of the data taken , to look for other axion scenario to which cast would also be sensitive . the tpc phase i data has been reanalysed in order look for 14 kev axions coming from m1 transitions .",
    "in addition , data taken with a calorimeter during the phase i , were used to search for high energy ( mev ) lines from high energy axion conversion  @xcite .",
    "more recently a few days of data were taken with a visible detector coupled to one end of the cast magnet  @xcite , in search for axions with energy in the `` visible '' range .",
    "it is foressen that a permanent setup will be installed in the experiment in order to take data without interfering with the standard program of cast .    at present",
    ", we are running with @xmath12 since 2008 and by the end of this year we shoud have reached sensitivities of around @xmath170.8ev .",
    "part of phase ii ) is compared with constraints obtained from the sumico experiment ( the tokyo helioscope ) and hb stars .",
    "the red dashed line shows our prospects for the @xmath12 run started in march 2008 .",
    "the vertical line ( hdm ) is the hot dark matter limit for hadronic axions @xmath18 inferred from observations of the cosmological large - scale structure .",
    "the yellow band represents typical theoretical models with @xmath19 in the range 0.077 where the green solid line corresponds to the case when @xmath20 is assumed .",
    "limits from laser , microwave and underground detectors  @xcite for axion searches have been included.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "cast original physics program will finish at the end of 2011 .",
    "the cast collaboration is looking into possibilities in order to achieve greater sensitivities .",
    "the sensitivity of helioscope axion searches depends strongly on the magnet s characteristics .",
    "ongoing r & d on dipoles will lead to stronger and bigger magnets in the coming years ( 2013 - 2015 ) .",
    "such magnets could either be adopted to the existing infrastructure of cast , thus eliminating the cost to the magnet itself , or be used with a new tracking and cryogenics system , improving thus many characteristics ( like daily tracking time , safety etc ) but increasing the cost . in parallel , effort will be devoted on the development of high efficiency focusing devices and new electronics for the detectors , aiming to achieve very low background levels .",
    "all this would allow pushing the sensitivity of the experiment to the level of 10@xmath21gev@xmath4 , probing the qcd axion model region for masses higher than 10@xmath22ev . in order to exceed the limit of 10@xmath21gev@xmath4 with a helioscope , specially developed magnets are necessary . taking advantage of the fact that the important parameter is the strength and not the homogeneity of the magnetic field , a stronger magnet with bigger aperture ,",
    "could be designed and constructed especially for such an experiment .",
    "this is a more expensive and long term option , which would allow reaching the limits of the helioscope axion searches with an increased discovery potential .",
    "these different options as well as expected sensitivities were presented in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the cast experiment has established the most stringent experimental limit on axion coupling constant over a wide range of masses , exceeding astrophysical constraints .",
    "the @xmath10 phase has allowed to enter in an unexplored region favoured by the theory axion models . from the absence of excess x - rays",
    "when the magnet was pointing to the sun , we set a preliminary upper limit on the axion - photon coupling of @xmath23 at 95% cl for @xmath24  ev , the exact result depending on the pressure setting . at present , with the @xmath12 run we are exploring deeper this region to reach sensitivities of @xmath171.2ev .",
    "the collaboration is looking into developping the new generation of helioscopes in order to reach sensitivities of the order of 10@xmath21gev@xmath4 leading to explore a large part of the qcd favoured model region including the otherwise non - accessible sub - kev range ."
