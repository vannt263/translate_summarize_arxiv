    "clusters of galaxies are large collections of galaxies , gas and especially dark matter , confined in a volume of a few @xmath0 .",
    "clusters and the filaments that connect them represent the largest structures in the present universe in which the gravitational force due to the matter overdensity overcomes the expansion of the universe .",
    "this condition allows clusters to collapse and eventually go through a process of virialization at the present cosmic time .",
    "rich clusters have typical total masses of the order of @xmath1 , mostly in the form of dark matter , while @xmath2 is in the form of galaxies and @xmath3 is in the form of a hot ( @xmath4 ) , tenuous ( @xmath5 ) , x - ray emitting gas @xcite . in terms of energy density",
    ", the gas in the cluster is typically heated to roughly the virial temperature , but there is room to accomodate , in principle , a non negligible amount of non - thermal energy , in the form of accelerated particles .",
    "a non - thermal component is in fact observed from several clusters of galaxies , mainly in the form of a tenuous radio emission @xcite . in some cases a hard ( non - thermal )",
    "x - ray emission is also observed @xcite , while more debate exists on the non - thermal origin of a soft x - ray and uv emission @xcite .",
    "the radio emission has a steep spectrum and appears mainly in two forms , halos and relics , the former being very extended , fairly regular and at the cluster center , and the latter being typically elongated and located in the outskirts of clusters .",
    "roughly @xmath6 of clusters with luminosity in the 0.12.4 kev band @xmath7 erg / s are observed to have radio halos @xcite . in general radio halos",
    "are rather rare phenomena @xcite , which means that their typical lifetime is relatively short ( @xmath8 gyr ) @xcite",
    ". such radio emission can only be interpreted as the result of synchrotron emission in the intracluster medium , thereby confirming that 1 ) relativistic electrons are present , 2 ) the intracluster medium ( icm ) is magnetized and 3 ) the magnetic field structure is topologically complex . the third point is inferred from the fact that the synchrotron emitting particles should be diffusively trapped on the scale of radio halos @xcite .    independent evidence for turbulent magnetic fields in the icm comes from faraday rotation measurements ( rm ) from radio sources located inside or behind clusters @xcite .",
    "this method leads to values of the field of the order of several @xmath9 @xcite , but the results are affected by uncertainties in the topology of the field and the spatial distribution of the electron gas , as well as by the subtraction of the intrinsic rm at the source .",
    "smaller fields , of the order of a few tenths of @xmath9 , are obtained from the combination of radio and hard x  ray measurements , in the few cases in which data at these wavelengths are available from the same cluster .",
    "this method relies on the assumption that the diffuse radio emission and the hard x  ray excess are cospatial and produced by the same population of relativistic electrons via synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering respectively @xcite .",
    "although it is generally accepted that at least a fraction of the icm is magnetized at @xmath9 level , the intrinsic uncertainties in both these methods do not allow yet a precise determination of the magnetic field and its spatial profile @xcite .",
    "the electrons responsible for the radio emission may be accelerated in a variety of ways and in a variety of sources within the icm .",
    "however , it is customary to classify the models of the origin of the non - thermal activity in _ primary electron models _ , _ secondary electron models _ and _ reacceleration models _ , depending on whether the radiating electrons are 1 ) accelerated in specific sites ( e.g. shocks , agns , galaxies ) , 2 ) produced as secondary products of hadronic interactions , or 3 ) continuously reaccelerated from a pre - existing population of non - thermal seeds in the icm .",
    "shock waves associated to the process of structure formation are expected to be the sites where most cosmic rays in clusters are accelerated . in particular , the large , strong shocks that bound the motion of matter in filaments and during accretion onto clusters",
    "are believed to be very efficient accelerators .    to date ,",
    "no non - thermal activity has reliably been observed from accretion shocks or large scale filaments . as we discuss later",
    ", these structures may however be detected in the near future or lead to phenomena that may be observable from within the cluster volume .",
    "no cluster of galaxies has been firmly detected in gamma rays so far @xcite .",
    "despite this non detection , two ideas contribute to reinforce the belief that clusters of galaxies can be interesting as high energy radiation emitters : in @xcite and @xcite it was first understood that the bulk of cosmic rays accelerated within the cluster volume would be confined there for cosmological times , thereby enhancing the possibility of inelastic proton ",
    "proton collisions and consequent gamma ray production through the decay of neutral pions .    in @xcite",
    "it was recognized that large scale shocks associated with the formation of structures in the universe , may accelerate electrons to tev energies , implying that high energy emission would occur due to the upscattering of the photons of the cosmic microwave background to gamma ray energies , through inverse compton scattering ( ics ) .",
    "the detection of gamma rays from clusters of galaxies , or more in general from large scale structures would represent an important and crucial step forward towards a better understanding of the processes of acceleration of particles in the icm and cosmic ray confinement .",
    "the measurement of the gamma ray flux associated with clusters can allow us to discriminate among vastly different scenarios for the origin of the non - thermal activity associated with the formation of large scale structures in the universe .",
    "this review is organized as follows : in  [ sec : confi ] we discuss the important phenomenon of cosmic ray confinement in the icm and the main energy loss processes for leptons and hadrons . in  [ sec : acceleration ] we summarize our understanding of the sources and acceleration sites for cosmic rays in clusters of galaxies . ",
    "[ sec : shocks ] is devoted to a discussion of the formation of large scale shocks during mergers or accretion and to assessing their role as cosmic ray accelerators . in ",
    "[ sec : fermi ] we discuss some recent developments in the theory of particle acceleration at shock waves , and their possible role for large scale structure formation shocks . in ",
    "[ sec : gamma ] we summarize the main predictions on the fluxes of gamma rays from clusters of galaxies , both in the gev and tev energy domains .",
    "the contribution of clusters of galaxies to the diffuse gamma ray background is discussed in ",

    "our conclusions are provided in  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the propagation of charged particles ( nuclei and electrons ) injected in the icm is mainly determined by diffusion , convection and energy losses .    as long as the turbulent part of the magnetic field remains smaller than the large scale field , the random walk in pitch angle that the particles perform , and the spatial diffusion that follows",
    "are described by the so - called _ quasi - linear theory _ @xcite .",
    "the diffusion coefficient for scattering of particles with alfvn waves is therefore @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the particle momentum , @xmath12 is the larmor radius for a particle of charge @xmath13 in a magnetic field @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the particle velocity and @xmath16 is the energy density in the form of turbulent field on a scale @xmath17 that interacts resonantly with particles with momentum @xmath18 .",
    "we introduced the power spectrum of the perturbations of the magnetic field @xmath19 , such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the minimum wavenumber @xmath22 is related to the largest scale in the turbulent magnetic field . in clusters",
    "it is usually believed that @xmath23 kpc . for a kolmogorov spectrum @xmath24",
    ", the diffusion coefficient reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the magnetic field in units of @xmath9 and @xmath27 .",
    "faraday rotation measures ( rm ) support a scenario in which most of the magnetic field energy is associated with a turbulent field tangled on both small and large scales @xcite . at small scales ( few kpc ) a bayesian analysis of the rm suggests that the power spectrum of the field follows a kolmogorov scaling @xcite , although the situation at larger scales might be more complex @xcite . in the absence of better estimates or measurements of the intracluster magnetic field strength and topology , here",
    "we assume @xmath28 .",
    "larger values of @xmath29 are hardly treatable within quasi - linear theory but qualitatively they lead to more effective confinement , although it is not even clear whether the particle propagation remains purely diffusive in such a limit .",
    "the diffusion time on the scale @xmath30 mpc of the whole cluster is @xmath31 , which exceeds the age of the cluster ( @xmath32 gyr ) for energies @xmath33 .",
    "particles with energies lower than @xmath34 are confined within the cluster volume , a phenomenon which is unique for clusters of galaxies and is mainly due to their very large physical size @xcite .",
    "the prediction of diffusive confinement of cosmic rays within the cluster volume is very strongly dependent upon the choice of the diffusion coefficient and even the specific assumptions on the parameters involved , due to both the energy content in the form of turbulent magnetic field ( the parameter @xmath29 ) and the spectrum of fluctuations in the b - field .",
    "for instance a spectrum with @xmath35 would lead to @xmath36 .",
    "the dependence on the coherence scale of the field is also important , the confinement being more efficient for smaller values of @xmath37 .",
    "while diffusing in the intracluster magnetic fields , charged particles are subject to energy losses : for electrons the dominant loss channels are ics off the photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , synchrotron emission , and coulomb losses ( at low energies ) .",
    "protons on the other hand lose energy mainly through @xmath38 inelastic scattering when their kinetic energy is higher than @xmath39 mev . at lower energies coulomb losses become important .",
    "the time scales for losses due to the combination of these processes are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : losses ] .",
    "the curve in the middle is the time scale of losses for protons , while the bottom curves represent the loss time scale for electrons in a mean magnetic field @xmath40 ( solid line ) and @xmath41 ( dashed line ) . in the same plot",
    "we also show the confinement time for the case of a kolmogorov spectrum with @xmath42 and @xmath43 kpc and mean magnetic field @xmath40 ( solid line ) and @xmath41 ( dashed line ) .",
    "one consequence of the confinement of the hadronic component in the icm is that the grammage traversed by cosmic rays is increased to the level that a substantial gamma ray production can in principle take place .",
    "the grammage for a cosmic ray proton with energy @xmath44 in a cluster is @xmath45 for @xmath46 ( here @xmath47 is the proton mass and @xmath48 is the gas density ) . for @xmath49",
    "the grammage decreases with energy .",
    "the value of @xmath50 should be compared with the nuclear grammage @xmath51 , which implies that an appreciable amount of the energy of a low energy cosmic ray is lost in inelastic @xmath38 scatterings , leading to gamma ray and neutrino production @xcite and to the generation of a secondary population of electrons and positrons .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : losses ] we can also conclude that electrons accelerated at specific sites can hardly radiate their energy far from the production site @xcite .",
    "this results in the fact that the region of radio emission is very localized , quite unlike what is observed in radio halos .",
    "radio emission at @xmath8 ghz is typically generated by electrons with energy @xmath52 gev , and at this energy the loss time is @xmath53 years . the distance covered by diffusion during the loss time is tiny compared with the observed size of the radio emitting region ( several hundred kpc at this frequency ) .",
    "the electrons could move farther from the production site due to advection ( for instance behind a shock ) , but this would need that fast shocks , with mach number larger than 45 , should cross the cluster cores , and still the radio emission would decay after @xmath54 million years , which would make radio halos less frequent than observed @xcite .",
    "these arguments lead to the requirement that electrons are generated or accelerated everywhere in the cluster , which leaves us with two possibilities : either the radiating electrons have a secondary origin , being produced by @xmath38 scatterings @xcite , or they are continuously reaccelerated _ in situ _ through a second order fermi mechanism @xcite .",
    "below we discuss these possibilities in some more detail .",
    "whether the radiating electrons are accelerated at specific sites , reaccelerated from pre - existing seeds or produced as secondary products of hadronic interactions , a class of sources of accelerated particles ( electrons , hadrons or both ) must exist in the icm . particle acceleration can take place in several places in the icm , from ordinary galaxies , which contribute a total luminosity in the form of protons @xmath55 , to active galaxies , which may plausibly contribute @xmath56 over periods of @xmath57 years @xcite .",
    "the process of structure formation contributes the most to the energetics of clusters , both in the thermal @xcite and non - thermal components @xcite .",
    "mergers between two or more clusters are observed to heat clusters @xcite and possibly accelerate particles @xcite , while it is harder to measure the effect of the continuous infall of material onto clusters from the colder outskirts .",
    "the two processes are not really independent , but for simplicity we will refer to the former as _ mergers _ and to the latter as _ accretion_. mergers provide the largest contribution to the heating of the icm , mainly through the production of weak shocks that transform an appreciable fraction of the relative kinetic energy of the merging clusters into thermal energy .",
    "accretion is less important in this respect but it is likely to play an important role for non - thermal phenomena ( see next section ) .    the total energy in a merger of two clusters with roughly equal mass @xmath58 is @xmath59 erg .",
    "a few of these events may lead the resulting cluster to reach the virial temperature or close to it .",
    "it is important to realize that the majority of the mass relevant for this estimate is in the form of dark matter , while only baryons ( and electrons ) are heated . in the assumption that the gaseous components of the initial clusters are at the virial temperature , it is easy to show that the merger occurs at supersonic relative speed , therefore implying the formation of shock waves .",
    "the same conclusion can be reached for the accreting material @xcite .",
    "if a fraction of this energy can be converted at the shocks into non - thermal particles through a first order fermi process , then the icm may be populated with a large amount of non - thermal particles , which may potentially become important even for the dynamics of the cluster @xcite .",
    "both electrons and protons can be accelerated at shocks , and secondary electrons can in turn be produced during inelastic collisions of cosmic ray protons in the icm .    in terms of the morphology of the resulting non - thermal emission these scenarios of injection of relativistic electrons",
    "are not equivalent .",
    "if electrons are accelerated at merger shocks , the resulting radio emission is found to have a filamentary structure tracing the position of the shock @xcite , rather than the regular , symmetric structure observed in radio halos .",
    "that is because , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : confi ] , electrons can not diffuse far away from their acceleration site , due to the short cooling time .",
    "radio relics are indeed interpreted as radio emission triggered by merger shocks @xcite .",
    "extended and fairly regular radio emission is predicted when the radiating electrons are of secondary origin , since parent protons can diffuse on large scales @xcite .",
    "however two aspects of radio halos are difficult to explain in this scenario : 1 ) since all clusters have suffered mergers ( hierarchical scenario ) and hadrons are mostly confined within clusters , extended radio emission should be basically observed in almost all clusters .",
    "radio halos are presently detected only in a fraction of massive and merging clusters @xcite .",
    "2 ) some of the observed radio halos are found to have a synchrotron spectrum with a cutoff at a few ghz @xcite , corresponding to a cutoff in the electron spectrum .",
    "this , together with the fact that radio halos are very extended , would require artificial and unrealistic assumptions in order to be consistent with secondary models @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the observational facts illustrated above are mainly based on a handful of clusters and might reveal themselves as incomplete when a more significant sample will become available .",
    "it is possible that some halos , possibly not yet identified , may have secondary origin , despite the fact that the ones that we are now aware of can hardly be exlained in this way .    gamma ray emission from clusters of galaxies",
    "is still believed to be the most effective way to detect the presence and confinement of cosmic ray hadrons in the intracluster medium .",
    "present observations of extended radio emission and , when present , of hard x - ray emission , are best explained by models of continuous reacceleration of electrons due to particle - wave interactions .",
    "a recent review can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we limit ourselves to provide a summary of the basic aspects of this class of models .",
    "reacceleration models are basically models of second order fermi acceleration @xcite , in which charged particles are accelerated stochastically due to the random interaction of the particles with perturbations ( waves ) in the structure of the magnetic field .",
    "these wave - particle interactions typically require that mildly non - thermal particles ( lorentz factors @xmath60 ) are already present in the region ( seed particles ) . in the case of clusters of galaxies these seeds",
    "could be provided by the past activity of active galaxies in the icm or more plausibly by the past merger history of the cluster @xcite .",
    "alternatively the seeds could be secondary products of hadronic interactions @xcite .    as stressed above",
    ", the extended radio emission from clusters of galaxies is a rather rare phenomenon , hinting to the fact that the episodes of radio activity are relatively short ( @xmath8 gyr ) . in the case of wave - particle interactions ,",
    "this scale is automatically recovered as a combination of the time necessary for the cascading of turbulence from large scales ( 300500 kpc ) to the small scales relevant for particle acceleration , and of the cluster ",
    "cluster crossing time .",
    "most scenarios of particle reacceleration in the icm are based on particle interactions with either large scale compressible modes ( magnetosonic ) or small scale alfvn modes .",
    "resonant particle acceleration due to alfvn modes is one of the most common mechanisms used in particle acceleration in astrophysics , as the resonant coupling with fast particles is the main channel of energy dissipation of these modes .",
    "alfvnic reacceleration has been used to explain the origin of the emitting electrons in radio halos @xcite .",
    "detailed time dependent calculations @xcite suggest that efficient alfvnic reacceleration of relativistic electrons might operate in the icm provided that the energy budget of relativistic hadrons is below 3 - 5% of that of the thermal icm and that a few percent of this thermal energy is channelled into the modes during a lifetime of a radio halo .",
    "relativistic hadrons affect the reacceleration of fast electrons because they provide the dominant contribution to the damping of alfvn modes in the icm : the acceleration of such hadrons increases the damping of the modes and this limits the acceleration of relativistic electrons ( _ wave  proton boiler _ ) @xcite .",
    "the injection process of alfvn modes in the icm and the assumption of isotropy of these modes represent the most important source of uncertainties in this class of models .",
    "alfvn waves couple with relativistic electrons ( and protons ) on very small spatial scales @xmath61 ( @xmath11 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 being the momentum , mass and larmor frequency of particles ) and this requires a surprisingly efficient alfvnic cascade if these modes are connected with the merger  driven turbulence on larger scales . in addition , the cascading of mhd turbulence in nature usually develops into an anisotropic spectrum on scales significantly smaller than the injection scale @xcite and this should strongly reduce the efficiency of particle acceleration @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , injection of alfvn modes at ( quasi ) resonant scales might occur as a consequence of the cascading of fluid turbulence @xcite , or of several kinds of plasma instabilities @xcite ; the physical details and efficiency of these mechanisms are however yet to be understood .",
    "some of the problems encountered with alfvn modes may be solved if the interaction of particles with compressible modes is considered , although new issues are also raised .",
    "compressible modes do not require injection on small spatial scales : a substantial fraction of the cluster turbulence is expected to be in the form of large scale compressible isotropic modes , which might efficiently accelerate fast particles via resonant transit time damping ( ttd ) and non  resonant turbulent ",
    "compression @xcite .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in these models is our ignorance of the viscosity in the icm .",
    "such viscosity could in fact severely damp compressible modes on large scales , inhibiting particle acceleration .",
    "on the other hand , turbulence in the icm is subsonic but strongly super - alfvnic , and in these conditions the bending of the magnetic field lines is expected to maintain the effective ion ",
    "ion mean free path much smaller than that in the classical unmagnetized case @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon should limit the viscous dissipation , so that collisionless dampings with the thermal and relativistic particles should represent the main source of turbulent dissipation . in this case",
    "detailed calculations of resonant  ttd and non  resonant stochastic coupling with fast modes in the icm suggest that the resulting efficiency of the particles re  acceleration could be sufficient to power radio halos , provided that the rms velocity of these compressible eddies is @xmath64 @xcite . here , at variance with the alfvnic case , the acceleration efficiency of electrons and positrons is not affected by the presence of relativistic hadrons since the damping of compressible modes in the icm is largely dominated by the ttd  coupling with thermal electrons and protons @xcite .    in models with stochastic reacceleration ,",
    "the spectrum of electrons has typically a cutoff at lorentz factors @xmath65 , therefore no appreciable ics gamma rays may be expected .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the role of protons in these models may be very important and one may reasonably expect gamma ray emission from either reaccelerated protons or through ics of the secondary electrons generated in inelastic @xmath38 collisions .",
    "moreover , stochastic reacceleration may significantly modify the shape of the spectrum of relativistic hadrons @xcite , thereby changing the shape of the spectrum of neutral pions and gamma rays .",
    "further investigations of these effects are certainly needed and desirable .",
    "as discussed above , most of the non - thermal energy content of clusters is believed to be associated with the process of large scale structure formation .",
    "we briefly review this process here , with particular emphasis on the issues which are most important for particle acceleration and related non - thermal phenomena in clusters .",
    "a wide consensus has been reached in the community on the hierarchical model of structure formation , which predicts that increasingly larger halos are formed by merging of smaller halos . on average smaller structures",
    "are therefore formed at earlier times than larger structures . during mergers between clusters ,",
    "shocks are driven by gravity in the diffuse baryonic component , which is heated up to x - ray temperatures @xcite .",
    "high resolution x  ray observations of clusters of galaxies performed with chandra and xmm have provided us with direct evidence for disturbed x - ray morphology and hot shocks associated with merging clusters @xcite .    while a complete understanding of the process of structure formation can only be achieved through numerical n - body simulations , a simple analytical description is useful in that it allows us to check the main numerical results versus some basic physical expectations .",
    "these analytical descriptions come in different flavors and are widely discussed in the literature .",
    "historically , the first approach to the problem was proposed by press & schechter ( hereafter ps ) @xcite and further developed in @xcite among others .",
    "the ps formalism provides us with the differential comoving number density of clusters with mass @xmath66 at cosmic time @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and with the rate at which clusters of mass @xmath66 merge at a given time @xmath67 to give a cluster with final mass @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "these two distributions can be randomly sampled to construct monte carlo realizations of the merger history of a cluster .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "2 @xcite for a cluster with present mass of @xmath1 .",
    "the history is followed backward in time to a redshift @xmath71 .",
    "the big jumps in the cluster mass correspond to major merger events , in which two subclusters collide to form a bigger object , while smaller jumps correspond to accretion events in which the cluster mass is increased by a small amount .",
    "the ps formalism has been extensively used in the past to investigate the heating of the icm and other thermal properties of clusters @xcite . in @xcite",
    "such approach has been generalized in order to describe the acceleration of particles at merger shocks and to investigate the implications for clusters non - thermal emission .",
    "the novelty in the approach resides in the combination of the ps formalism with a recipe to evaluate the mach number of merger related shocks .",
    "an accurate determination of the shock strength is of crucial importance for predicting the non - thermal behavior of clusters of galaxies , since the spectrum of the particles accelerated at a shock is , at least in the test particle approximation , uniquely determined by its mach number .    the mach number of merger  related shocks can be estimated by using an approach introduced in its original version in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption is that the two merging clusters , with masses @xmath72 and @xmath73 are virialized to start with .",
    "the virial radius for each cluster can be written as follows : @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 is the hubble constant and @xmath77 is the matter density fraction .",
    "the cluster formation redshift @xmath78 is on average a decreasing function of the mass , meaning that smaller clusters are formed at larger redshifts , although fluctuations in the value of @xmath78 from cluster to cluster at given mass are present due to the stochastic nature of the merger tree .",
    "the relative velocity of the two merging clusters , @xmath79 , can be easily calculated from energy conservation : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the reduced mass and @xmath82 is the turnaround radius of the system , where the two subclusters are supposed to have zero relative velocity .",
    "in fact the final value of the relative velocity at the merger is quite insensitive to the exact initial condition of the two subclusters , being quite close to the free fall velocity .",
    "the sound speed in the cluster @xmath83 is given by @xcite @xmath84 where the virial theorem has been used to relate the gas temperature to the mass and virial radius of the cluster . the adiabatic index of the gas is @xmath85 .",
    "the mach number of each cluster while moving in the volume of the other cluster is then @xmath86 .",
    "here it has been implicitely assumed that the mach number remains constant during the whole merger .",
    "the procedure illustrated above can be applied to a generic couple of merging clusters , and in particular it can be applied to a generic merger event in the history of a cluster with fixed mass at the present time .",
    "[ fig : mergertree ]    in fig .",
    "2 ( right panel ) the differential distribution of shock mach numbers is shown .",
    "results have been extracted from 500 realizations of the merger history of a cluster with present mass @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the most striking feature of the histogram is a very pronounced peak at mach number @xmath87 .",
    "this means that merger shocks are generally very weak , most of them are mildly supersonic , and only @xmath3 of merger shocks populate the tail of the distribution , with mach number above @xmath88 @xcite",
    ".    the mach number may be higher than that provided by the procedure illustrated above if the merger takes place in an overdense region such as a supercluster , or if the whole temporal evolution of the merger is considered instead of a mean value during the merger event .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that none of these effects alters significantly the results illustrated above : the former effect is negligible for very massive clusters @xcite , and the latter leads only to a slight increase of the merger velocity , less than a factor of two , but limited to a small fraction of the duration of the merger event @xcite .",
    "some additional uncertainties might arise from the assumption that the merging clusters are virialized to start with and from the assumptions made on the spatial distribution of dark matter in the parent halos .    due to the intrinsic complexity of the process of structure formation ,",
    "numerical simulations are the best way to study properties of cosmological shock waves such as the shock velocity , strength and morphology , although much care is needed in the identification of shocks and in evaluating their efficiency as particle accelerators .",
    "results from earlier simulations @xcite were in clear disagreement with the above mentioned semi - analytical findings .",
    "the distribution of mach numbers reported in @xcite for shocks located in the inner @xmath89 region of clusters exhibited a pronounced peak at @xmath90 , weaker shocks being virtually absent .",
    "more recently , higher resolution simulations led to a revision of these earlier results , and significantly mitigated the discrepancy between the two approaches . according to @xcite",
    ", there is a peak in the distribution of shock surfaces in the whole simulated box at @xmath91 , in very nice agreement with fig .",
    "moreover , the same authors showed that most of the shock energy is dissipated at weak shocks ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "these results have been confirmed in @xcite , where energy is found to be mostly dissipated at shocks with mach number @xmath93 .",
    "x - ray observations have allowed the measurement of the mach number of merger - related shocks in the inner regions of a few clusters . to date , the strongest shock ever observed in the icm has a mach number of the order of @xmath88 @xcite , while claims of detection of weaker shocks have been reported @xcite .    besides mergers",
    ", the growth of structures proceeds through the so - called _ secondary infall _ onto already formed objects @xcite , or _",
    "accretion_. clusters continuously attract unbound matter in their neighborhood and their mass increases due to accretion of this new material .",
    "accretion shocks form around clusters and propagate outwards , carrying the information on the virialization of the inner regions .",
    "the existence of non virialized gas outside clusters is suggested by cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "this gas is structured in low density , relatively cold filaments and sheets ( @xmath94 ) whose x  ray emission is expected to be tenuous and hardly detectable by present day instruments .",
    "the low temperature of the gas implies that accretion shocks are always rather strong , with mach numbers that may exceed @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the total cluster mass accreted through these shocks is less than @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "this implies that , even if accretion shocks are very strong and thus able to dissipate efficiently the kinetic energy of the accretion flow , they do not contribute significantly to the total energy budget of clusters @xcite .",
    "a vast literature exists on the problem of diffusive particle acceleration at collisionless shocks @xcite . in its _ test particle _ version ,",
    "the theory is simple and predicts that the spectrum of accelerated particles is a power law @xmath97 , with a slope which is determined uniquely by the mach number @xmath98 of the supersonic fluid , @xmath99 . for shocks with",
    "mach number @xmath100 the spectrum of the accelerated particles varies between @xmath101 and @xmath102 . for @xmath103 , where the peak of merger related shocks was found ,",
    "the spectrum is as steep as @xmath104 : such weak shocks can only play a role as heaters of the intergalactic medium , while being irrelevant for particle acceleration . as we discuss below , the efficiency of injection at such weak shocks is also expected to be negligibly small .",
    "the convolution between the efficiency as particle accelerators and the steepeness of the spectrum selects the merger related shocks that are most relevant for particle acceleration in the icm @xcite .",
    "the process of acceleration of hadrons and electrons during cluster mergers has different peculiar aspects .",
    "the time scale for energy losses of electrons is shorter than the mean time between two mergers .",
    "thus , it is a good approximation to assume that only the last merger event contributes to accelerate electrons and that these radiate for approximately their loss time .",
    "the spectrum of the accelerated electrons at each shock is a power law , with a slope which is expected to be hard enough to produce appreciable non - thermal emission only in the few ( @xmath105 ) mergers characterized by a relatively high mach number ( @xmath106 ) @xcite .",
    "the confinement of hadrons in the cluster volume for cosmological time scales implies that any new merger related shock front , besides accelerating a new population of particles from the thermal pool , also re - energizes previously accelerated nuclei @xcite . as a consequence , the spectrum of the hadrons present at any time in a cluster is the result of both acceleration and reacceleration of all previously confined hadrons .",
    "the combination of these effects makes the spectra of confined hadrons depart from a power law @xcite , being steeper at low energies and gradually flatter at higher energies .",
    "this result was obtained by making the simple but most likely unrealistic assumption that the acceleration efficiency is independent of the mach number ( see below for a discussion of the problem based on the non  linear theory of shock acceleration ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that while the efficiency of a shock as a particle accelerator depends on the unknown details of injection , the efficiency for reacceleration is known @xcite .",
    "the situation changes dramatically if one considers strong accretion shocks .",
    "according with the standard ( test particle ) theory of particle acceleration , these shocks should result in a universal spectrum @xmath107 since their mach number is expected to be very large . on the other hand , in these conditions test - particle theory",
    "is known to fail , to an extent which depends upon several aspects of the problem ( maximum energy , mach number , presence or absence of turbulent heating , efficient generation of waves through streaming instability ) .",
    "the violations of test particle theory are grouped together in what is named _ shock modification _ , which is mainly determined by the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles on the shock structure .",
    "the development of a non - linear theory of diffusive particle acceleration at shock fronts , which allows to accurately describe the shock modification and at the same time calculate the spectrum of the accelerated particles , is one of the major developments in the investigation of the process of particle acceleration in the last decade ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the main points of the non - linear theory of diffusive shock acceleration can be summarized as follows : 1 ) strong shocks are efficient accelerators , to the point that the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles can not be neglected ; 2 ) this dynamical reaction is responsible for a gradual slowing down of the fluid upstream of the shock front , the so - called _ shock precursor _ , which reflects the spatial distribution of the pressure of the accelerated particles ; 3 ) the precursor results in a non - power law , concave spectrum , flatter than the test - particle prediction ( @xmath108 ) at high energies and steeper than that at low energies ; 4 ) as a consequence of efficient particle acceleration , less energy is available for heating of the downstream gas , which therefore is predicted to be colder than expected on the basis of the standard rankine - hugoniot relations .    the shock modification induced by the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles leads to a determination of the efficiency for particle acceleration as a function of the mach number of the shock , which is crucial for assessing the role of shock fronts for particle acceleration during structure formation .    some of the implications of the theory for large scale structures have been discussed in @xcite and are now recognized as crucial to understand the role of cosmic rays in clusters of galaxies and their neighborhood . in order to illustrate the main results , we adopt here the approach described in @xcite , where injection was treated following ref .",

    "this issue deserves further investigation , and it will likely constitute one of the most interesting future developments in the field .",

    "the radio emission can be used to impose limits on the amount of hadronic cosmic rays trapped in the icm , and therefore on the flux of gamma rays due to @xmath122 decay that may be expected @xcite .",
    "these limits are usually rather model dependent , in that the amount of cosmic ray energy that is allowed depends on magnetic field strength , slope of the proton spectrum and spatial distribution of cosmic rays in the intracluster medium . with these limitations ,",

    "the spectrum of the gamma radiation is also a power law at large enough energy , with a high energy cutoff which may be due to either lack of confinement of the parent protons or to absorption of gamma rays in the infrared background ( in fact in the former case a steepening is expected rather than a cutoff ) . at the low redshift of the coma cluster ( @xmath129 ) the opacity due",

    "the detection of tev photons with a brightness profile correlated with the gas density profile would hint to the presence of relativistic hadrons in the icm and would allow to finally measure the cluster non thermal energy content .",
    "the detectability of the ics gamma ray signal from electrons accelerated at either merger or accretion related shocks crucially depends on the strength of the shocks formed in either one of these cases .",
    "only strong shocks can accelerate particles with spectra hard enough to result in an appreciable gamma ray emission .    the logn - logs diagram of clusters of galaxies as gamma ray sources was calculated in @xcite using the ps based formalism described in sec .",

    "the calculations refer to the case of a constant efficiency of electron acceleration of @xmath137 , independent of the mach number of the shocks .",
    "it is worth stressing that the electrons accelerated according with this recipe provide a negligible contribution to the diffuse radio emission and to the hard x - ray emission . within these assumptions , about @xmath138 clusters should be detected in gamma rays above 100 mev by glast , equally distributed between merging and accreting clusters .",
    "agile on the other hand might be able to detect @xmath95 clusters .",
    "moreover , according to these predictions , no cluster should have been detected by egret , in agreement with what observed @xcite .",
    "the self  consistent determination of the shock mach numbers and of the slope of electron spectra is the crucial ingredient of these calculations @xcite .",
    "previous approaches , relying on the incorrect assumption that all the structure formation shocks are strong ( and thus the electron spectrum is always the canonical @xmath139 power law ) , led to exceedingly optimistic predictions on the number of detectable sources @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of acceleration of electrons at shocks is an unknown quantity .",
    "the value of 5% which is generally adopted is a reasonable ( maybe even optimistic ) guess , but nothing more .",
    "recent claims @xcite that this efficiency could be measured in the case of supernova shocks also appears rather optimistic , given the numerous assumptions that such as estimate is based upon ( for instance the mach number of the shock is very different in the two cases , the shock modification could play a crucial role , the strength of the magnetic field could be dramatically different and for remnants showing tev emission it is hard to distinguish between leptonic and hadronic scenarios ) .    in fig . 5 ( right panel ) we show the ics gamma ray spectrum in the tev domain as expected from a coma - like cluster of galaxies at 100 mpc distance .",

    "accreting clusters are even more extended ( @xmath145 ) and thus harder to detect .",
    "more specifically , a telescope like hess could probe the flux levels considered here only after @xmath146 hours of observation .",
    "another channel for the production of gamma rays in the icm is related to the possibility that ultra high energy protons ( @xmath147 ) may be present in the icm @xcite . before escaping the cluster ,",
    "a proton with energy @xmath148 loses a fraction of its energy by interacting with cosmic microwave background photons , producing electron  positron pairs via the bethe - heitler process .",

    "possible sources of very high energy protons include agns @xcite or cluster accretion shocks @xcite .",
    "the corresponding gamma ray flux is however extremely uncertain and in the absence of efficient confinement up to such high energies the flux may be too low to be ever detectable .",
    "in the last decade clusters of galaxies have often been proposed as the sources of the extragalactic diffuse gamma ray background , but more accurate calculations have always lowered their contribution to a negligible fraction .",
    "this has been a hot topic in the field , with numerous papers addressing the issue @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly summarize the relevant aspects of the problem .",
    "early interest in clusters of galaxies as potential sources of the diffuse gamma ray background was stimulated by the discovery of cosmic ray confinement in the intracluster volume @xcite , which increases the effective column density for the process of pion production . in @xcite",
    "many potential sources of cosmic rays were considered , and the contribution of clusters of galaxies to the diffuse background observed by egret was found to be negligible .",
    "this result was later confirmed in a more detailed calculation @xcite , where however the spectrum was chosen _",
    "ad hoc _ as a rather flat power law ( @xmath151 with @xmath152 ) , resembling the spectrum of particles accelerated at astrophysical shocks and having in mind the secondary electron model for the origin of radio halos . the diffuse flux of gamma rays as calculated in @xcite is plotted in fig . [ fig : gamma ] ( left panel ) , where the shaded region provides an estimate of the uncertainties arising from source luminosities and cosmological models . in the light of the most recent understanding of particle acceleration in clusters of galaxies , these fluxes should be considered as upper limits to the actual hadronic contribution of clusters of galaxies to the diffuse extragalactic gamma ray background .",
    "as discussed in the previous sections , electrons are also expected to be accelerated in the icm . here",
    "we concentrate our attention on electrons accelerated at either merger or accretion shocks .",
    "electrons accelerated at each merger or accretion event lose energy through ics on the photons of the cosmic microwave background , which get upscattered to gamma ray energies .",
    "the diffuse flux of gamma radiation due to ics of electrons accelerated in mergers ( dashed line ) and during accretion ( dotted line ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] ( right panel ) , where an acceleration efficiency ( for electrons ) of @xmath137 has been assumed @xcite . the observed diffuse flux is represented by the shaded region @xcite ( a recent re - analysis of the egret data led to a slightly lower extragalactic diffuse gamma ray background @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation of the contribution of merger shocks requires to fix a minimum mass of the merging clusters .",
    "the dashed line refers to a minimum mass @xmath153 , while a more realistic result is plotted as a dash - dotted line , where the minimum mass is fixed at @xmath141 ( roughly the mass of a galaxy group ) . in the same figure we plot for comparison the predictions of @xcite ( solid line ) , where the same acceleration efficiency was adopted .",
    "several arguments have been presented in @xcite to explain the difference between their predictions , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] and those of @xcite , the basic points being , as already discussed above , that it is crucial to properly evaluate the mach numbers of the merger shocks and that it is somewhat important to keep track of the redshift evolution of the merger rate .",
    "the contribution of merger shocks to the diffuse extragalactic gamma ray background is therefore likely to be in between the dashed and the dash - dotted line .",
    "the flux of gamma radiation from both mergers and accretion is a factor @xmath154 smaller than the observed background and smaller than the flux predicted in @xcite , by the same factor .",
    "an acceleration efficiency of the order of @xmath155 should be adopted in order to reproduce observations .",
    "this would be unreasonable for electrons as accelerated particles , and would violate our initial assumption of shock acceleration in the linear regime ( no backreaction of the accelerated particles on the shock ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "a reevaluation of the diffuse gamma ray background from large scale structure shocks was carried out by using n - body simulations .",
    "the results seem to be consistent with those plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] . in @xcite",
    "the authors emphasize the difficulties in the identification of shocks with mach number below @xmath125 ( and the impossibility to detect shocks with mach numbers below @xmath156 ) .",
    "clusters of galaxies are sites where non - thermal activity has been observed , mainly in the form of radio and hard x - ray radiation , resulting from synchrotron and inverse compton emission of relativistic electrons respectively .",
    "the sources of such electrons , the acceleration mechanisms involved in their production and the coexistence of a hadronic component in the icm are subjects of intense debate , which we summarized here . at the present time",
    "observations seem to require a contribution from particle reacceleration through either resonant or non resonant particle - wave interactions .",
    "although the general principle that this acceleration process is based upon is well understood , several details deserve more attention , especially in the direction of achieving a fully self - consistent picture of particle acceleration in the presence of plasma instabilities in the intracluster medium .",
    "the development of this line of investigation appears to be even more justified by the uprising of modern observational facilities such as lofar and lwa , operating at low radio frequencies , where giant radio halos are expected to be more frequent @xcite .",
    "both primary and secondary models of radio halos run into problems in explaining self  consistently morphological , spectral and statistical properties of extended radio halos .",
    "however , it should be clear that most of these constraints derive from direct analyses of the data on the coma cluster and a few other clusters that have been studied in a systematic way , and might reveal themselves as incomplete when larger samples will become available .",
    "the detection of gamma rays from nearby clusters of galaxies would provide us with a powerful tool to discriminate among the various models proposed to explain observations .",
    "an overview of the existing predictions and models appears quite timely , since several gamma ray telescopes are starting to operate ( hess , magic , veritas ) and some others are coming soon ( glast , agile ) .",
    "the basic mechanisms for the production of gamma radiation in the icm are 1 ) the decay of neutral pions produced in inelastic @xmath38 collisions and 2 ) ics of high energy electrons on the photons of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "both electrons and protons ( or more in general nuclei ) are expected to be accelerated at the shock fronts that form during the process of structure formation .",
    "these shocks are typically classified as merger shocks and accretion shocks , depending on whether they are generated in the inner regions of the parent clusters ( which makes them weaker due to the high temperature of the icm ) or in the outskirts and filaments , where fast , cold , non virialized plasma falls into the gravitational potential well of the parent cluster .",
    "a small fraction of merger shocks may also have relatively large mach number .",
    "the contribution of the hadronic channel to gamma ray emission is rather model dependent because there may be several classes of sources that may contribute at different levels and with different spectra of accelerated particles .",
    "if acceleration takes place at the shocks that develop during structure formation , then an estimate of the energy in the form of non - thermal particles may be obtained from the merger history of a cluster as described by the hierarchical model of structure formation . at each merger event",
    "that a cluster suffers a new population of hadrons is injected but the pre - existing cosmic ray population , diffusively confined in the icm @xcite , is also reaccelerated @xcite .",
    "this combination of effects was shown to result in non - power law spectra . due to the weakness of shocks in the inner parts of galaxy clusters ,",
    "the spectra of accelerated particles are typically steep , and the proton spectrum accumulated in the icm as a result of mergers does not lead to intense gamma ray emission @xcite .",
    "acceleration at accretion shocks in the outskirts of clusters is more promising ( the mach number is @xmath154 ) and the particles could be advected into the cluster and trapped there for cosmological times .",
    "the gamma ray emission due to @xmath122 decay in this scenario might be detected by glast , depending on the acceleration efficiency at the accretion shock .",
    "if additional hadrons are injected by sources in the icm ( galaxies , agns ) the gamma ray flux due to hadronic interactions may be somewhat higher @xcite .",
    "rather strong limits on the energy content allowed to be in the form of non - thermal hadrons can be imposed ( mostly adopting the coma cluster as the prototype cluster ) by using the egret upper limits @xcite , upper limits on the flux of tev photons @xcite and the existence of the cutoff in the radio spectrum at ghz frequency @xcite .",
    "typically these methods lead to conclude that not more than @xmath157 of the energy of the cluster can be in the form of a non - thermal population of hadrons .",
    "these limits are however rather model dependent and should be used with care . if the amount of hadrons is not much smaller than this value , and particle spectra are hard enough ( @xmath107 ) , forthcoming observations in the tev domain might finally detect the first gamma rays from clusters .",
    "the detection of gamma rays generated through ics of high energy electrons accelerated at merger and accretion shocks appears somewhat more promising .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lognlogs ] , @xmath158 clusters should be detectable with glast in the energy range @xmath159 mev .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the fact that egret has not detected any cluster @xcite .",
    "the detection of gamma rays in the tev energy range appears more problematic , due to the extended size of the emission region .",
    "the contribution of clusters of galaxies to the extragalactic diffuse gamma ray background is less than @xmath160 of the flux measured in @xcite . as better observations will become available ,",
    "it is possible that the classes of sources that contribute to the extragalactic gamma ray background may become better identified , either by subtraction of known sources , or by identification of new objects with a given gamma ray emission .",
    "from the theoretical point of view the most important development in the understanding of the non - thermal aspects of structure formation will most likely come from the introduction of non linear effects in diffusive particle acceleration at shocks .",
    "these effects are showing all their importance for the case of supernova remnants as cosmic ray accelerators and it is likely that a similar role will arise in the future for large scale structure shocks .",

    "<S> clusters of galaxies and the large scale filaments that connect neighboring clusters are expected to be sites of acceleration of charged particles and sources of non - thermal radiation from radio frequencies to gamma rays . </S>",
    "<S> gamma rays are particularly interesting targets of investigation , since they may provide precious information on the nature and efficiency of the processes of acceleration and magnetic confinement of hadrons within clusters of galaxies . here </S>",
    "<S> we review the status of viable scenarios that lead to the production of gamma rays from large scale structures and are compatible with the multifrequency observations that are already available . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the possibility of detection of gamma rays with space - borne telescopes such as glast and ground based cherenkov telescopes , and the physical information that may be gathered from such observations . </S>"
