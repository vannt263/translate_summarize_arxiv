    "the most fundamental characteristics of the earliest galaxies are challenging to determine directly . these galaxies lie at the edge of observability , or beyond , for even the largest current ground- and space - based telescopes , and inferences based on local stellar populations ( from , e.g , the milky way s stellar halo ) are uncertain at best . in particular , it is difficult to determine the characteristics of the luminosity function of high redshift galaxies , which directly influences how reionization proceeds in the early universe .",
    "a recent example of this are efforts to use the hubble ultra deep field and its extensions @xcite , and , separately , lensed observations of high redshift galaxies from the hubble frontier fields @xcite , to estimate the luminosity function for galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "these observations succeeded in directly measuring the stellar luminosity function for galaxies with luminosities within a few magnitudes of l@xmath6 , but no deeper .",
    "the work of @xcite and @xcite provides only weak constraints on the faint - end slope of the luminosity function , which has profound theoretical implications ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if the slope of the luminosity function is very steep , this implies a vast number of dim galaxies , unobservable by current instruments , that can produce more than enough ionizing photons to complete and sustain reionization with no additional sources ( such as high - redshift black hole populations ) needed .",
    "if , on the other hand , the slope of the high - redshift luminosity function is shallow , there will be fewer galaxies than one might expect , with too few ionizing photons and thus the need for additional sources of ionizing radiation .",
    "a second question related to the shape of the high - redshift luminosity function is that of its ending point : how bright are the smallest high - redshift galaxies ?",
    "simulations of population iii stars and the transition to metal - enriched star formation suggest that the smallest halos to form stars have masses of around @xmath7  m@xmath3 @xcite , with correspondingly few stars and low luminosities .",
    "these simulations predictive capabilities , however , suffer from challenges relating to small - number and small - volume statistics .",

    "while this can be done by using many small , widely spaced fields instead of one larger field @xcite , this may be undesirable , and thus a deeper understanding based on theory may be necessary to correctly interpret high - z survey results .    in this paper",
    ", we address these pressing issues regarding the high redshift galaxy luminosity function using the _ renaissance simulations _  a trio of physics - rich simulations of high redshift galaxy formation that resolve several hundred galaxies apiece , and which explore a range of cosmic environments at @xmath9 . using these simulations ( described in section  [ sec : methods ] ) , we show results ( in section  [ sec : results ] ) that predict the high redshift galaxy luminosity function will flatten at magnitudes that can be probed by the next generation of telescopes .",

    "this is most apparent in the void simulation , because the ionization front from the overdense sheet has not yet propagated into that region and there are no void galaxies to reionize their surroundings .",
    "the key results presented in this paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "the ultraviolet luminosity function of our simulated galaxies is consistent with observations of high - z galaxy populations at the bright end of the luminosity function ( m@xmath58 ) , but at lower luminosities is essentially flat rather than rising steeply as inferred by a schechter function fit to observational data , and has a clearly - defined lower limit in uv luminosity .",
    "this behavior of the uv luminosity function is due to two factors : ( i ) the strong dependence of the star formation rate on halo virial mass in our simulated galaxy population , with lower - mass halos having systematically lower star formation rates and thus lower uv luminosities ; and ; and ( ii ) the fact that halos with virial masses below @xmath2  m@xmath3 do not universally contain stars , with the fraction of halos containing stars falling with decreasing virial mass and reaching zero at @xmath59  m@xmath3 .",
    "3 .   the brightest of our simulated galaxies may be visible to current and future ultra - deep space - based surveys at @xmath60 ( and likely at lower redshifts as well ) , particularly if lensed regions are chosen for observation .",
    "the primary result of this paper  the flattening of the mass function  is significant for our understanding of the reionization of the universe .",
    "observations of high redshift galaxies provide poor constraints on the low - luminosity end of the galaxy luminosity function , and thus make it challenging to accurately account for the full budget of ionizing photons during that epoch .",
    "our work suggests that there are far fewer faint galaxies at high redshift than one would infer from fitting a schechter function to the high - luminosity end , as has been done by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "taken at face value , a smaller number of galaxies would result in an _",
    "under_-production of photons relative to what is needed to reionize the universe .",
    "however , the _ planck _ 2015 results @xcite , particularly the thomson scattering optical depth @xmath61 corresponding to an instantaneous reionization redshift @xmath62 , relieve the previous tension between reionization constraints from polarization measurements of the cmb and galaxy observations @xcite .",
    "there are many complicating factors when computing a reionization history from a galaxy luminosity function  in particular , the uv photon escape fraction and its relationship to the halo virial mass ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  and we defer a detailed analysis to future work ( xu et al .",
    "2015 , in prep . ) .",
    "recent work has shown that low - mass galaxies ( @xmath63 ; @xmath64 ) prior to reionization have typical escape fractions in the range 550% with the upper range occurring when supernova blastwaves and ionization fronts create low - density channels that allow ionizing radiation to freely escape into the neutral intergalactic medium @xcite . in more massive halos ,",
    "the simulations of @xcite showed that the time - averaged uv escape fraction for a particular galaxy is only @xmath5610% ( although @xcite suggest that this fraction may be considerably lower over halos with a mass range of @xmath65  m@xmath3 , with a time - averaged value of around @xmath66 ) .",
    "this suggests that low - luminosity galaxies may provide a non - negligible amount of the ionizing photon budget , given their higher escape fractions and number densities .",
    "the flattening of the high redshift galaxy luminosity function at the faint end is a robust result in our simulations ( and has been suggested by other , albeit less physics - rich , simulations ",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "what is less robust , however , is what can be inferred from the overall normalization of the luminosity function from our calculations . given jwst s small field of view , cosmic variance will present a significant challenge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have sampled regions of varying mean density , which gives some sense of cosmic variance . however , a precise discussion of this subject is difficult because of the small cosmological volumes sampled , as well as the somewhat arbitrary nature of our choice of resimulated regions .",
    "we note that the strongly evolving stellar mass fraction as a function of halo mass has an intriguing similarity with observations of local group dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where there is a strong positive correlation between a given galaxy s mass - to - light ratio and its bolometric luminosity .",
    "the smallest local dwarf galaxies are strongly dark matter - dominated , having similar stellar fractions to our lower - mass galaxies , and the trends are similar as well . while it is hard to make precise comparisons between local group observations and high - redshift galaxy simulations , the similarity in trends suggests that there may be universal , halo mass - dependent behaviors in galaxy formation .",
    "figure  [ fig : halofraction ] indicates something intriguing ",
    "namely , that there is some physical effect that quenches star formation in low mass halos in the early universe . the cause is not reionization ",
    "figure  [ fig : projections ] demonstrates that the universe is patchily reionized at this epoch  but rather h@xmath10-photodissociating lyman - werner radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the universe is transparent to this radiation , and thus star formation anywhere in the volume can suppress molecular hydrogen elsewhere , with the level of suppression growing with the comoving star formation rate density .",
    "the consequence of this suppression is that low - mass halos of primordial composition , which cool primarily by h@xmath10 line emission , must grow to be more massive and hotter before the gas in the halo core can cool efficiently , which suppresses population iii star formation ( and , thus , metal - enriched star formation ) .",
    "once halos reach this threshold mass ( which depends on the strengh of the lyman - werner background ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , stars can then form .",
    "we note that at later times , when the universe is transparent to hydrogen - ionizing photons , a similar but more pronounced effect must exist due to this photon population .",
    "figures  [ fig : starfraction ] and  [ fig : halofraction ] strongly suggest that the flattening of the galaxy luminosity function is due to a combination of decreased star formation rate at low halo virial masses and the lack of stars in halos below @xmath67  m@xmath3 .",
    "a simple toy model using the analytic halo mass function convolved with a constant specific star formation rate and the halo stellar occupation fraction from figure  [ fig : halofraction ] is shown as the magenta line in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : lumfctn ] , and matches the properties of the luminosity function of our simulated galaxies quite well , accurately capturing the deviation from a schechter function , the overall flattening at intermediate luminosity , and the termination at the low - luminosity end .",
    "the dependence of stellar fraction on halo mass is well - known observationally ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is also seen in simulations of more massive galaxies at lower redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we speculate that this behavior is due to a combination of cooling and stellar feedback .",
    "gas in low - mass halos cools inefficiently due to the low virial temperature , and stellar feedack can efficiently remove metal - enriched gas from these low - mass halos ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which further decreases the efficiency with which gas can cool and form stars .",
    "the suppression of star formation in halos below @xmath67  m@xmath3 ( and complete absence below @xmath68  m@xmath3 ) is likely due to inefficient cooling , destruction of h@xmath10 via lyman werner radiation from neighboring halos , and the resulting jeans screening ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that there is an effective lower limit on the masses of high - redshift galaxies , and thus a definitive lower end to the uv luminosity function .",

    "1 .   calculate the comoving number density of cosmological halos as a function of halo virial mass m , @xmath69 , at @xmath27 for the wmap7 best - fit cosmology , using the fitting function of @xcite .",
    "2 .   for each halo mass bin , calculate the recent star formation history of the halo assuming a constant specific star formation rate of @xmath70  yr@xmath71 over the last 100 myr .",
    "this results in a constant star formation rate , under the assumption of constant halo mass .",
    "3 .   given this star formation history and the assumption of a simple salpeter imf with parameters identical to those in the @xmath72 milky way ( consistent with our simulation treatment of metal - enriched stars ;",
    "see section  [ sec : methods ] ) , calculate the imf - integrated bolometric luminosity of the stars that have not yet undergone supernovae at the epoch under consideration . given that this luminosity is dominated by the most massive and hottest stars ( since luminosity scales approximately as stellar mass to the fourth power ) , we make the assumption that the uv luminosity of the stellar population in each halo is roughly its bolometric luminosity .",
    "this results in a comoving number density of halos as a function of uv magnitude , @xmath73 , where m represents absolute uv magnitude .",
    "4 .   finally",
    ", we multiply the resulting quantity by the fraction of halos that have experienced recent star formation as a function of halo mass that is shown in figure  [ fig : halofraction ] , using the crude approximation shown by the grey line .",
    "this fit captures the essence of the figure  namely , universal recent star formation above m@xmath74  m@xmath3 , no recent star formation below @xmath68  m@xmath3 , and a steady decrease in star formation with decreasing halo mass between those endpoints .",
    "this toy model captures several of the essential features of the luminosity function shown by our simulations : it has a significant slope at the high - luminosity end , flattens out at @xmath75 , and goes entirely to zero at @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , the properties of this toy model are robust to several of the simplifying assumptions made here .",
    "the most critical of these are as follows :    * specific star formation rate : * the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) evolves as both a function of redshift and halo mass .",
    "this evolution is most pronounced at low redshift ( @xmath77 )  at higher redshifts , such as those considered in this work , the ssfr evolves very slowly with redshift and is relatively insensitive to halo mass ( see , e.g. , appendix f of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making the approximation of a constant ssfr sensible .",
    "we note that at the redshifts and halo masses of interest to the work presented here this quantity is extremely hard to constrain observationally ; however , extrapolating the observed trends to @xmath78 suggests little evolution .",
    "deviation from a constant ssfr will modify the predicted uv luminosity function in proportion to the deviation .",
    "* halo formation history : * cosmological halos grow over time , and do so particularly quickly at the redshifts considered in this work . assuming that the specific star formation rate is directly proportional to halo mass , this implies that the total ( as opposed to specific ) star formation rate in a given halo is increasing rapidly as well .",
    "the period of 100 myr over which the star formation rate is assumed to be constant is a significant fraction of the hubble time at high redshift ( @xmath79  myr at @xmath80 , @xmath81  myr at @xmath27 ) , suggesting that this assumption may be suspect .",
    "however , the uv luminosity is dominated by massive stars having lifetimes of millions of years , and thus the production of uv photons is dominated almost entirely by the very recent star formation history of the halo . as a result , the uv luminosity is quite robust to the exact details of the halo s formation history , with deviations from constant star formation rate contributing mildly to variation in magnitude",
    ".      the simulated behavior of the uv luminosity function at the faint - end can be suspectible to limited numerical resolution . to check for any spurious effects , we compare our results to our previous work @xcite that",
    "focused on 32 first - generation galaxies in a small comoving volume of ( 1 mpc)@xmath17 with a dm particle mass resolution of 1840  , 15 times smaller than the dark matter particles in the simulations presented in this paper .",
    "the major shortcoming of our previous work was the limited galaxy sample size , which was rectified in the renaissance simulations .",
    "these two simulation suites share the same subgrid physics models  chemical reaction networks , metal - free and metal - enriched star formation , and radiative and supernova feedback .",
    "although the renaissance simulations can not capture population iii star formation in the smallest minihalos ( @xmath82 ) , properties of metal - enriched star formation , in particular the stellar mass  halo mass relation , agree very well between the two simulation suites ( see fig . 4 in * ?",
    "there we showed that this relationship in both simulations were within 1-@xmath83 of each other in halos with @xmath84 , which are the smallest halos considered in our analysis .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that the uv luminosity function was flat at magnitudes @xmath85 , consistent with our findings in the renaissance simulations .",
    "thus , we are confident that the flattening of the luminosity function is not a result of limited numerical resolution but is caused by the suppression of star formation from radiative and supernova feedback effects in halos with masses @xmath86 ."

    "<S> this behavior of the luminosity function is due to two factors : ( i ) the strong dependence of the star formation rate on halo virial mass in our simulated galaxy population , with lower - mass halos having systematically lower star formation rates and thus lower uv luminosities ; and ( ii ) the fact that halos with virial masses below @xmath2  m@xmath3 do not universally contain stars , with the fraction of halos containing stars dropping to zero at @xmath4  m@xmath3 . </S>",
