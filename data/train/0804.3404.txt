    "through an improved treatment of the statistical physics of the distribution of solid clusters in the liquid phase , we have developed a model of steady - state nucleation in an ocp , and the results of our model are in accord with those of the time - dependent molecular dynamics simulations of @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that crystallization in an ocp occurs at a rate that is more than five orders of magnitude higher than previously assumed .",
    "nucleation in an ocp differs from nucleation in many other media because of two unique features of an ocp : ( 1 ) the degenerate electron background , which supplies the pressure , is unaffected during the phase transition .",
    "consequently , both pressure and volume remain constant .",
    "although the complete non - interaction of the electrons is an approximation of the ocp model , the role electrons play in more realistic models is negligible @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the binding of ions of like charge in a crystal is weak .",

    "indeed , this difference does not exceed @xmath55 ( i.e.  @xmath96 does not exceed @xmath97 ) until @xmath98 .",
    "the combination of these two features has interesting implications for the crystallization of an ocp .",
    "in particular , nucleation in an ocp is driven to a significant degree simply by the increase in entropy resulting from cluster formation : the change in the total energy of a supercooled ocp when a cluster forms is small relative to the increase in the entropy .",
    "in fact , equation ( [ reversework2 ] ) implies that a population of solid clusters will exist at a given time for a range of @xmath99 because the entropy of an ensemble of clusters embedded in a liquid ocp is higher than that of the pure liquid phase .",
    "this may be related to the caging effect observed in molecular dynamics simulations of an ocp in the liquid phase @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we note that a reanalysis of the entropy of mixing term and thereby the classical nucleation rate may be needed for other supercooled liquids .",
    "there are a few important issues that we have not addressed .",
    "the surface free energy of a solid cluster in a coulomb liquid is not known .",
    "the expression for the surface free energy contribution used in this work is only our best estimate , but we can not be confident that the numerical coefficient in equation ( [ alphaeq ] ) is accurate .",
    "this issue requires further investigation via molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "some of the assumptions we made in sec .",
    "[ equilibriumdist ] may not be valid .",
    "we assume that solid clusters grow or shrink by the addition or subtraction of liquid monomers , but the simulations of daligault @xcite imply both that two solid clusters can fuse together and that a solid cluster can fission into two or more clusters .",
    "furthermore , we assume that all clusters of a given size have the same morphology and are thus indistinguishable , but the simulations of daligault @xcite show that two clusters of the same size can in fact have different morphologies .",
    "we currently do not know what effects , if any , a violation of either of these assumptions would have on our results .",
    "further molecular dynamics simulations are imperative to understand nucleation in an ocp .",
    "it is evident from equations ( [ nucrateeq]-[alphaeq ] ) that the steady - state nucleation rate may be written as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a function only of @xmath0 . numerically confirming that the nucleation rate scales linearly with @xmath22 and @xmath102",
    "should be simple .",
    "one could then deduce @xmath101 , and hence @xmath74 , by measuring the nucleation rate for several different values of @xmath0 .",
    "calculations for @xmath103 would be particularly useful .",
    "figure 1 shows that there is an enormous difference between our results and those of previous authors : our model predicts that some clusters should form rather quickly , whereas other models predict that clusters essentially never form .",
