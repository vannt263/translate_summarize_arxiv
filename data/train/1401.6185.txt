    "the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe is a long standing cosmological puzzle calling for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in terms of the baryon - to - photon number ratio @xmath5",

    "leptogenesis @xcite provides an attractive solution since it relies on a minimal and natural way to extend the sm incorporating neutrino masses and mixing discovered in neutrino oscillation experiments : the seesaw mechanism @xcite . at the same time",
    "it should be noticed that leptogenesis also relies on the brout - englert - higgs mechanism and , therefore , the recent discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc nicely contributes to support the picture . on the other hand the non - observation of new physics at the lhc so far , places stronger constraints on low scale baryogenesis scenarios such as , for example , electroweak baryogenesis within the minimal supersymmetric standard model @xcite .",
    "the prediction of the baryon asymmetry relies on some assumption on the initial conditions .",
    "a plausible and common one is that an inflationary stage before leptogenesis resets the initial conditions in the early universe , enforcing vanishing values of the asymmetry and of the right - handed ( rh ) neutrino abundances prior to the onset of leptogenesis .",
    "however , it can not be excluded , especially at the high temperatures required by a minimal scenario of leptogenesis @xcite , that other mechanisms , such as gravitational @xcite , gut @xcite , affleck - dine baryogenesis @xcite , generate a large asymmetry at the end of inflation and/or prior to the onset of leptogenesis .",
    "since these mechanisms escape experimental probes , it would be certainly more attractive if the final asymmetry from leptogenesis were independent of the initial conditions . in this paper",
    "we show that , given the current low energy neutrino data , the possibility to enforce independence of the initial conditions in leptogenesis , so called strong thermal leptogenesis , barring quasi - degenerate rh neutrino masses and strong fine tuned cancellations in the flavoured decay parameters and in the seesaw formula , implies a lower bound on the absolute neutrino mass scale , more specifically on the lightest neutrino mass . though this lower bound can be evaded allowing for fine tuned cancellations , most of the models require values of the lightest neutrino mass that will be tested during the coming years , especially in the case of no .    the plan of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we introduce some basic notation and review current experimental information on low energy neutrino parameters . in section 3",
    "we briefly discuss strong thermal leptogenesis . in section 4",
    "we show the existence of a lower bound on the neutrino masses under certain conditions .",
    "we also present results from a scatter plot analysis confirming the existence of the lower bound and at the same time showing how the bulk of models require values of the lightest neutrino mass that can be potentially tested in future years mainly with cosmological observations . in section 5",
    "we draw the conclusions .",
    "we assume a minimal model of leptogenesis where the sm lagrangian is extended introducing three rh neutrinos @xmath7 with yukawa couplings @xmath8 and a majorana mass term @xmath9 . after spontaneous symmetry breaking",
    "the higgs vev generates a dirac neutrino mass term @xmath10 . in the seesaw limit the spectrum of neutrino masses splits into a set of three heavy neutrinos with masses @xmath11 , approximately equal to the eigenvalues of @xmath9 , and into a set of light neutrinos with masses @xmath12 given by the seesaw formula d_m = u^ m_d 1d_m m_d^t u^ , written in a basis where both the majorana mass and the charged lepton mass matrices are diagonal , so that @xmath13 can be identified with the pmns leptonic mixing matrix .    from neutrino oscillation experiments we know two mass squared differences , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "neutrino masses can then be either no , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , or io , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    ", there is just one parameter left to be measured , the so called absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "this can be conveniently parameterised in terms of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath3 .",
    "the most stringent upper bound on @xmath3 comes from cosmological observations .",
    "a conservative upper bound on the sum of the neutrino masses has been recently placed by the _ planck _",
    "collaboration @xcite . combining _ planck _ and high-@xmath22 cmb anisotropies , wmap polarisation and baryon acoustic oscillation data ,",

    "when neutrino oscillation results are combined , this translates into an upper bound on the lightest neutrino mass , [ planck ] m_1 0.07 ev ( 95% ) , showing how cosmological observations start to corner quasi - degenerate neutrinos .    for no",
    "the leptonic mixing matrix can be parameterised as @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) while for io , within our convention of labelling light neutrino masses , the columns of the leptonic mixing matrix have to be permuted in a way that u^(io ) = (    ccc s_13e^-i & c_12c_13 & s_12c_13 + s_23c_13 & -s_12c_23-c_12s_23s_13e^i & c_12c_23-s_12s_23s_13e^i + c_23c_13 & s_12s_23-c_12c_23s_13e^i & -c_12s_23-s_12c_23s_13e^i    ) diag(e^i , e^i , 1 ) .",

    "this result is again confirmed by a scatter plot analysis .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "5 directly in the form of the distribution of probabilities for @xmath3 .",
    "one can see how this time there is no lower bound for @xmath175 and we could obtain points satisfying successful strong thermal leptogenesis with arbitrarily small @xmath3 .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath199 is just slightly higher than @xmath203 ( this time @xmath204 ) still implies that one has to fine tune the parameters in the orthogonal matrix in order to maximise @xmath197 , and this still acts in a way that in the limit @xmath205 the density of points drops quickly . for example one can see that for @xmath159 one still has that @xmath206 of the solutions are found for values @xmath1 ( the value quoted in the abstract ) .    in fig .",
    "6 we also show again the results of the scatter plots in the planes @xmath207 ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "one can see how , while values of @xmath208 can be found for arbitrarily small values of @xmath3 , the maximum value of @xmath122 for small values of @xmath209 is just slightly greater than @xmath171 .",
    "this confirms that @xmath122 is the crucial quantity that constrains @xmath3 in the case of io , since the orthogonal matrix has to be strongly fine tuned in order to have @xmath210 .      as pointed out in 3.2 , for @xmath211gev , the condition @xmath212 gets relaxed into @xmath213 .",
    "potentially this condition can be much more easily satisfied and in particular the value of @xmath110 has not to be necessarily very large . in this way",
    "the condition of successful leptogenesis becomes independent of the value of the initial pre - existing asymmetry and can be more easily satisfied .",
    "however , this point does not substantially change the results on the absolute neutrino mass scale obtained for the case of large @xmath214 .",
    "the reason is that these , as we have seen , depend only on the the @xmath167 s rather than on @xmath169 and in particular on the fact that for the no ( io ) case the value of @xmath194 ( @xmath199 ) is very close to @xmath171 . in fig .",
    "7 we show again @xmath169 and the three @xmath167 for the no case .",
    "one can compare the results with those obtained for the case of large @xmath214 shown in fig .  3 and notice how except for @xmath169 , that now can also be below @xmath171 , the scatter plot for @xmath121 , the crucial quantity , is substantially the same .",
    "let us discuss a few points before concluding this section .",
    "_ the results depend on neutrino oscillation experimental data_. it should be noticed how the results we obtained rely on the smallness of @xmath194 ( @xmath199 ) for no ( io ) for @xmath215 and this is enforced by the current measured value of the pmns matrix entries as we have seen , in particular @xmath216 for no and @xmath217 for io .",
    "therefore , the strong thermal leptogenesis condition realises an interesting interplay between low energy neutrino data and leptogenesis predictions .",
    "_ theoretical uncertainties_. our results have been derived using the analytical expressions eqs .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) , ( [ finalpas ] ) and ( [ finalpaslowm3 ] ) . we have already noticed how these can be derived in the appropriate limit from density matrix equations .",
    "our results neglect momentum dependence in the wash - out but it has been noticed that in the case of strong wash - out , as imposed by strong thermal leptogenesis , this approximation underestimates the wash - out @xcite though it has been recently claimed that this is actually an effect that arises not from momentum dependence but from a proper account of quantum statistics in the wash - out rates that increase them by @xmath218 @xcite .",
    "this would tend to slightly relax our lower bound . on the other hand , taking into account higgs and quarks asymmetries , would act in the opposite direction @xcite .",
    "another consequence of accounting for these asymmetries is flavour coupling .",
    "this would tend to open new ways to the pre - existing asymmetry to escape the lightest rh neutrino wash - out @xcite .",
    "account of flavour coupling would then act into the direction of tightening the lower bound and this is likely the strongest effect .",
    "these effects will be taken into account in a forthcoming publication .",
    "_ case @xmath219_. how do the results change if the pre - existing asymmetry is assumed to have the same flavour composition for leptons and anti - leptons , so that @xmath219 in the eqs .",
    "( [ finalpas ] ) , ( [ finalpaslowm3 ] ) ? in this case",
    "there is no lower bound for any value of @xmath73 , simply because now the strong thermal condition is also satisfied if @xmath220 , independently of the value of @xmath121 depending on @xmath3 .",
    "however , it is clear that this possibility is realised for very special models where basically the @xmath30 s have to decay into leptons without a muon component , i.e. @xmath221 , a very special case though not excluded by experimental data . indeed in the scatter plots we find a few of such points independently of @xmath3 .",
    "however , even though they evade the lower bound on @xmath3 , they basically do not modify the @xmath3 distributions .",
    "therefore , this caveat corresponds to a very special and definite situation that does not change the general results .    _",
    "@xmath4-inspired models_. our results are in perfect agreement with the results found in @xcite where , in addition to the strong thermal condition , @xmath4-inspired conditions are also imposed on the dirac neutrino mass matrix . in this case",
    "no case is a necessary condition .",
    "moreover one finds @xmath222 and our lower bound gives @xmath181 that is indeed respected since the range @xmath223 is found , showing that the @xmath4-inspired conditions further restrict @xmath3 basically pinning down a very narrow range for @xmath3 .    _",
    "form - dominance models @xcite_. in these models each light neutrino mass is inversely proportional to one different rh neutrino mass .",
    "they correspond to an orthogonal matrix equal to one of the six permutation matrices @xcite .",
    "in this situation the needed cancellation in the eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) , in order to have @xmath112 and at the same time large @xmath121 and @xmath197 , is impossible .",
    "the only way to have a small @xmath224 in these models is to have small @xmath3 values with @xmath225 ( while necessarily @xmath226 ) but in this case then , as we have seen , one can not simultaneously satisfy the conditions @xmath56 .",
    "therefore form - dominance models can not realise strong thermal leptogenesis .",
    "these two examples show how our analytical procedure can be applied to specific models with definite and in general much stronger constraints on @xmath3 .        as we have seen for no successful strong thermal leptogenesis favours @xmath227 for @xmath228 and in our scatter plots we found less than @xmath229 of points at lower values .",
    "there is even a strict lower bound @xmath186 valid for any choice of the orthogonal matrix . for io",
    "the constrains are looser .",
    "there is not such a strict lower bound and only for @xmath230 we found a number of points less than @xmath229 .",
    "it is then very important that in the next years neutrino oscillations experiments will be able to solve the ambiguity between no and io neutrino masses .",
    "if no will prove to be correct , then strong thermal leptogenesis can be more easily tested since it strongly favours @xmath181 , values sufficiently large to produce measurable deviations from the full hierarchical case ( i.e. semi - hierarchical neutrinos ) in cosmological observations .",
    "cosmological observations are sensitive to neutrino masses and are able to place an upper bound , typically quoted on @xmath231 ( though future observations might become sensitive to the full neutrino spectrum ) .",
    "future observations could potentially reach a precision of @xmath232 @xcite . in the case of no , assuming that they would be able to measure the hierarchical lower limit finding @xmath233 , they would be able to place a @xmath234 upper bound @xmath111 . from our results",
    "this means that future cosmological observations will be potentially able to severely constraint strong thermal leptogenesis with hierarchical rh neutrinos . on the other hand",
    "a measurement @xmath235 would correspond to @xmath236 , allowing to place a @xmath237 lower bound @xmath181 , and this would be in agreement with the expectations from strong thermal leptogenesis . in the case of io , a measurement @xmath238 , in agreement with the hierarchical limit for io , would correspond to a @xmath234 upper bound @xmath239 , representing a much looser constraint on strong thermal leptogenesis that in the no case .",
    "moreover expected values @xmath1 would correspond to measurements @xmath240 , in general not distinguishable from the inverted hierarchical limit , i.e. not testable .",
    "this shows how no would be a much more favourable option than io for a significant test ( negative or positive ) of strong thermal leptogenesis , since it more strongly favours detectable deviations from the hierarchical limit ( @xmath241 ) .",
    "it should be noticed that no ordered neutrino masses with @xmath242 would also yield @xmath243 as for io hierarchical neutrino masses ( @xmath244 ) and this is another reason why it is important that neutrino oscillation experiments will be able to solve the no - io ambiguity independently of absolute neutrino mass experiments .      in the central panel of fig .  1 we have also plotted the values of the neutrinoless double beta decay effective neutrino mass @xmath245 versus @xmath3 from the scatter plot ( both for no and io ) .",
    "we have also shown the results without imposing strong thermal leptogenesis ( yellow points ) .",
    "it can be seen how for no , since the effective neutrino mass can be well below @xmath3 thanks to phase cancellations @xcite , this can be as small as @xmath246 even for @xmath181 ( as indicated by the horizontal and vertical solid lines respectively ) .",
    "this implies that strong thermal leptogenesis is not able to produce effective constraints on @xmath245 .",
    "vice - versa , however , a future measurement of @xmath247 would imply necessarily @xmath181 providing an interesting strong support to the strong thermal leptogenesis expectations . for io , again , the strong thermal prediction hardly produces detectable deviations from the inverted hierarchical limit .      in the case of absence of signal",
    ", the katrin experiment will be able to place an upper bound onto the effective electron neutrino mass @xmath248 translating into a similar upper bound on @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , it will not be able to place severe constraints on strong thermal leptogenesis . in the project 8 experimental proposal @xcite ,",
    "the energy of electrons emitted in tritium beta decay is determined from the frequency of cyclotron radiation and the upper bound could be improved to @xmath249 .",
    "this would translate again into a similar upper bound on @xmath3 , providing a more stringent constraint but still not able to severely corner strong thermal leptogenesis .",
    "thanks to the current measured values of the neutrino mixing angles , and in particular of @xmath127 , the assumption of strong thermal leptogenesis can be tested quite strongly by future cosmological observations , especially in the no case . if these will be able to place a stringent upper bound on the lightest neutrino mass scale @xmath111 , then they will strongly corner the idea of strong thermal leptogenesis .",
    "this will survive only admitting quite a strong fine tuning in the seesaw formula and/or in the flavoured decay parameters .",
    "the result would be much stronger for the no case than the for the io case .",
    "therefore , it is important that future neutrino oscillation experiments will be able to solve the no - io ambiguity . on the other hand",
    "a positive measurement @xmath181 could be certainly considered as an important experimental information supporting strong thermal leptogenesis .",
    "it is fascinating that , thanks to the forthcoming advance in the determination of neutrino parameters , we will have soon the opportunity to test important theoretical ideas in relation to a fundamental cosmological puzzle such as the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .",
