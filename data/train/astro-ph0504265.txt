    "the thermodynamic properties of the intra  cluster medium ( icm ) reflect the full history of the cosmic evolution of baryons .",
    "this evolution is primarily driven by gravity , which shapes the gas distribution on large scales and determines the hierarchical assembly of cosmic structures , but also by a complex interplay with the hydrodynamic processes of star formation and galaxy evolution ( see rosati et al . 2002 ; voit 2005 for recent reviews , and references therein ) . due to the high density and temperature reached by gas in the environment of galaxy clusters and groups , x ",
    "ray observations provided so far the most powerful diagnostics on its thermal properties .    the simplest model for the evolution of the icm accounts only for the action of gravity ( kaiser 1986 ) . this picture is said to be self ",
    "similar because it predicts that galaxy groups and clusters of different richness are essentially scaled versions of each other .",
    "based on this realization , one can then derive unique scaling relations between x  ray observables .",
    "for instance , the x  ray luminosity , @xmath2 , should scale with the gas temperature @xmath3 as @xmath4 ; the `` entropy '' @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the electron number density ) should scale linearly with temperature owing to the self ",
    "similarity of the gas density profiles .",
    "furthermore , spherical gas accretion in a nfw halo ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) predicts entropy to scale with the cluster ",
    "centric distance as @xmath7 ( tozzi & norman 2001 ) .    while adiabatic hydrodynamical simulation of clusters have validated this simple picture ( e.g. , navarro et al .",
    "1995 ; eke et al . 1998 ; borgani et al . 2001 ) , a number of observations have now established that gravity can not be the only player : the gas density profiles in the central regions of groups and poor clusters are observed to be shallower than in the self - similar model , and the relative entropy level is correspondingly higher than in rich clusters ( e.g. , ponman et al .",

    "these observational facts call for additional physics in the form of non  gravitational processes , capable of breaking the self",

    "a number of authors have proposed the presence of extra heating , possibly occurring before the cluster collapse ( e.g. evrard & henry 1991 ; kaiser 1991 ; bower 1997 ; cavaliere , menci & tozzi 1998 ; balogh et al .",

    "radiative cooling determines the minimum entropy level of the x  ray emitting gas through a selective removal of gas with short cooling time . on the other hand ,",
    "non  gravitational heating affects the amount of gas which can cool down to form stars , thereby preventing a cooling runaway .",
    "independent of the details of the model and the nature of the assumed heating energy , it has been common prejudice that the icm entropy would only be affected in the central regions of clusters , while the self  similarity would be preserved in the halo outskirts , where dynamics is still dominated by gravity .",
    "however , based on a semi  analytic model for gas accretion in clusters , voit et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have recently predicted that a smoothing of the gas density due to preheating in infalling sub  halos would boost the entropy production at the accretion shock of clusters . as a result , an excess of entropy with respect to the prediction of the self  similar model is generated in the cluster outskirts .",
    "this effect due to smooth accretion should be more important for poorer systems , since their accretion is dominated by smaller clumps which are more affected by pre  heating .",
    "therefore , entropy generation is expected to be more efficient in smaller systems , thus boosting their entropy profiles more than those of more massive structures .",
    "observational support for this model has been provided by ponman et al .",

    "the question then arises as to whether the observed entropy structure of groups and clusters can be used to derive information on the nature of the feedback that affects the thermodynamical history of cosmic baryons .",
    "whatever the astrophysical source of this feedback is , it must act in such a way as to regulate star formation and , at the same time , to reproduce the observed entropy profiles .",

    "although the model provides a realistic description of the cosmic star formation history ( springel & hernquist 2003b ) , clusters are found to have approximately self  similar entropy profiles , which is not consistent with observations .",
    "this result demonstrates that generating the required level of entropy amplification at cluster outskirts is a challenging task for hydrodynamical simulations even if they treat star formation and feedback .",
    "a number of simple feedback schemes have been suggested that heat the gas surrounding galaxies in order to better reproduce the observed entropy scaling ( e.g. kay et al .",
    "while such experiments provide very useful guidelines , it is clear that a self  consistent numerical implementation of a physically well motivated feedback model which can successfully satisfy a large body of observational constraints is highly desirable .    in this paper ,",
    "we use hydrodynamical simulations to explore a suite of different heating schemes , both for radiative and non  radiative runs .",
    "we focus on four objects which cover the mass range from poor clusters to poor groups .",
    "the aim of our analysis is to verify whether an appreciable entropy amplification at large radii , as predicted by voit et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , can be obtained with simple preheating schemes and/or with self  consistent models that include feedback from sn  driven galactic winds .",
    "the main questions that we intend to address with our analysis are the following : ( a ) is the entropy amplification by smoothed accretion confirmed by hydrodynamical simulations when a simple scenario for pre - heating with an entropy floor is invoked ?",
    "( b ) does this effect persist when simulations include a realistic treatment for star formation and sn feedback ?",

    "looking at table [ t : simul ] , we note that the heating energy required to create the entropy floors is comparable to those of the winds . however , the way in which these two feedback schemes affect the thermodynamics of the diffuse baryons is intrinsically very different .",
    "the first heating mechanism provides a diffuse energy input that can in principle reach all the gas particles in the simulations , and is provided in an impulsive way ( i.e. all the energy is released at the heating redshift @xmath0 ) . the second mechanism , instead",
    ", releases energy gradually in time , since it follows the pattern of star formation , and it is narrowly concentrated around star  forming regions .",
    "as we will discuss in the following , these differences have an important impact on the smoothing of the accretion pattern and , therefore , on the entropy generation by accretion shocks .",
    "in figure [ fi : gh ] , we compare the effect of imposing the two different entropy floors on the entropy profiles of the cluster simulation and of ` group-3 ' . here and in the following we plot profiles to an innermost radius which contains 100 sph particles .",
    "this radius has been shown to be the smallest one where numerically converged results for the x - ray luminosity can be obtained ( borgani et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "as expected , the effect of pre  heating is that of increasing the level of the icm entropy by a larger amount for the less massive system , an effect that increases in strength for a higher entropy floor .",
    "the runs with gravitational heating display a number of wiggles which mark the positions of merging sub  halos carrying low",
    " entropy gas .",
    "these wiggles are erased once the gas is pre  heated .",

    "heating destroys the gas content of halos whose virial temperature is lower than the specific pre  heating energy . in the cluster run ,",
    "the entropy increase due to pre ",
    "heating is marginal at the virial radius , thus implying that the overall icm thermal energy content within @xmath44 is mainly determined by the action of gravity .    in figure [ fi : srnr ]",
    ", we provide further information about the effect of pre  heating on the entropy structure of the icm . here",
    "we show the entropy ",
    "density phase diagram of gas particles .",
    "the two separate concentrations of points mark the gas particles falling within @xmath53 and those having cluster - centric distances in the range @xmath54 , the former being those having larger densities .",
    "following these two populations of gas particles allows us to understand the different effects that non ",
    "gravitational physics has in the innermost and in the outskirt regions of the icm . in the outer cluster regions in the gh runs ( left panels ) , the change of slope in the @xmath55@xmath56 relation marks the transition from diffuse ( shocked ) accretion to clumpy accretion",
    "( see also sect .",

    "heating with an entropy floor of 100 kev @xmath24 ( s100 runs , right panels ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the effects of pre  heating are : _ ( a ) _ to cancel any signature of clumpy accretion in the outskirts ; _ ( b ) _ to suppress the gas density in the central halo regions , and _",
    "( c ) _ to amplify the entropy of both the diffuse phase in the outer regions and of the gas in the central regions , by an amount that increases for lower  mass systems .    in their semi",

    "( 2003 ) have shown that the post - shock gas entropy is higher than it would be without preheating , at a given density , by an amount between @xmath57 and @xmath55 , where @xmath55 is the added entropy .",
    "therefore , when comparing the profiles of preheated simulations to the corresponding gh profiles where the preheating entropy level is simply added to it , any excess entropy should then be attributed to the amplification effect due to accretion of smoothed gas instead of clumps .",
    "we expect this effect to become more prominent for stronger pre  heating , which makes the accretion more diffuse , and for smaller groups , where the accretion is dominated by comparatively smaller gas clumps . in fig .",
    "[ fi : gh ] , the long  dashed curves show the profiles obtained by adding the floor value , @xmath47 , to the gh profile .",
    "consistent with the expectation from the model by voit et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we find clear evidence for the entropy amplification effect .",
    "it is more apparent for the higher entropy floor and for the smaller halo of the group-3 .",
    "for instance , at @xmath58 , we obtain for the cluster simulations an amplification of 14 per cent and 84 per cent for the s25 and s100 runs , respectively .",
    "these numbers increase to about 230 per cent and 300 per cent , respectively , for the ` group-3 ' runs .",
    "we note that our pre  heating scheme does not increase the entropy of each gas particle by a fixed extra amount .",
    "instead , it creates an entropy floor , so that the extra entropy assigned to each particle can be zero if the particle is already at high entropy , or just the value required to attain the floor value . on the other hand , the model by voit et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is a prediction for the entropy amplification when pre  heating is implemented by adding a constant amount of entropy to all gas particles . in this case , we would have obtained a stronger pre  heating and , therefore , an even stronger amplification effect .",
    "the signature of differential entropy amplification extending out to outer regions of groups and clusters is in line with observational evidences based both on rosat / asca ( e.g. ponman et al .",
    "2003 ) and xmm  newton data ( e.g. pratt & arnaud 2004 ; piffaretti et al .",
    "2005 ) . however , despite the trend of progressively higher relative entropy levels in groups",
    ", the observational data also indicates that the shape of entropy profiles is almost independent of mass , with no evidence for the presence of large isentropic cores .",
    "this is quite different from the behaviour seen in our non  radiative simulations , where an amplification of entropy at the cluster outskirts is obtained at the price of creating much flatter entropy profiles in groups and larger isentropic cores than in clusters ( see fig.[fi : gh ] ) .",
    "the results for the entropy profiles change substantially for the radiative runs . in figure",
    "[ fi : csf ] , we compare the profiles for the simulations including cooling and star formation , obtained by either changing the parameters of the winds ( left panels ) or by adding a pre  heating entropy floor to the feedback of the w1 model . as for the `` cluster '' , increasing the wind speed leaves the entropy profiles completely unaffected in the halo outskirts .",
    "as for the central regions , increasing the wind speed from the w1 to the w2 model slightly decreases the entropy level .",
    "in fact , the stronger feedback creates a population of lower entropy particles which are kept in the hot phase by the larger amount of energy feeback , instead of cooling down . further increasing the wind speed ( w2 and w3 runs ) or changing the parameters defining the wind decoupling do not further change the entropy profile for the cluster .",
    "although the effect of stronger winds is more apparent for the ` group-3 ' run , it is nevertheless still marginal for @xmath59 .",
    "however , increasing the wind speed has a significant effect on the entropy profile in the inner regions of ` group-3 ' : the stronger feedback creates a nearly isentropic regime for @xmath60 , while the profile steepens again in the innermost regions , where cooling starts to dominate .",
    "quite intriguingly , a similar behaviour has been recently found by mahdavi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , based on an analysis of galaxy groups observed with xmm  newton .",
    "they find entropy profiles with a broken power ",
    "law shape @xmath61 , with an inner and outer slope of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , and a transition that takes place at about @xmath64 .",
    "we also note that the presence of a strong wind reduces the resulting fraction of stars from about 20 per cent to about 13 per cent ( see table 2 ) . on one hand",
    "this demonstrates that strong winds do increase entropy and , therefore , the cooling time of the gas surrounding star  forming regions ( e.g. , springel & hernquist 2003b ; borgani et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) . on the other hand , the results shown in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fi : csf ] also indicate that this effect is not causing a transition from clumpy to diffuse accretion , as would be required to generate an entropy amplification effect .    allowing the wind particles to be decoupled until they reach lower densities , and hence allowing them to travel to a larger distance from the star  forming regions before interacting with the diffuse gas ( model w4 ) , only produces a modest change .",
    "since the mechanical wind energy is thermalized at lower gas densities in this model , radiative losses are reduced as a consequence of longer cooling times . however , the resulting additional suppression of star fraction ( see table [ t : simul ] ) and increase of the entropy in the ` group-3 ' simulation are too small to change our conclusions .",
    "these results on the effect of winds are also supported by the phase ",
    "diagrams shown in figure  [ fi : srrad ] , by the relative distribution of low  entropy and high  entropy particles in the halo outskirts , shown in figure  [ fi : parts ] , and by the maps of gas density of the ` cluster ' runs , shown in figure  [ fi : maps ] .",
    "the latter demonstrates that both in the proto ",
    "cluster region at @xmath22 and in the cluster at @xmath19 , the stronger winds wash out only the smallest halos and make the larger ones slightly puffier , while preserving the general structure of the cosmic web surrounding the lagrangian cluster region .    by comparing the results of the w1 and w3 models in figs .",
    "[ fi : srrad ] and [ fi : parts ] ( left and central panels , respectively ) , we see that a higher wind speed has also a negligible effect on the cluster , despite being able to erase accreting clumps in the outskirts and to push the gas in the central regions of the ` group-3 ' simulation to higher entropy . in all cases , we find that the stronger winds of the w3 and w4 models are quite ineffective in increasing the entropy of the diffusely accreting gas .",
    "a larger effect on the icm entropy structure is induced by adding a pre  heating entropy floor to the w1 feedback ( right panels of fig .",
    "[ fi : csf ] ) . in this case , a sizable amplification is obtained for both the ` group-3 ' and the ` cluster ' simulations , at least when the higher entropy floor , @xmath65 kev @xmath24 , is used . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : maps ] , this entropy amplification is associated with a much smoother gas density distribution , both at @xmath22 and at @xmath19 . in this case , the filamentary structure of the gas distribution is completely erased , while only the largest halos are able to retain part of their gas content .",
    "this visually demonstrates that a transition from clumpy to smooth accretion during the process of cluster formation requires a more broadly distributed form of feedback .    the effect on the @xmath55@xmath56 phase diagram",
    "is shown in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fi : srrad ] : adding the entropy floor has a stronger impact in smoothing the pattern of gas accretion than increasing the wind speed . also , fig .",
    "[ fi : parts ] shows that almost no signature of clumpy accretion is left in the ` group-3 ' run . comparing these results to those of the non  radiative runs",
    "shows that radiative cooling significantly reduces the entropy amplification .",
    "the main reason for this is that cooling increases gas density within accreting clumps and filaments , thus partially inhibiting the transition from clumpy to diffuse accretion .",
    "this effect can be appreciated by comparing the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fi : srrad ] with the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fi : srnr ] .",
    "while the presence of cooling does not significantly change the entropy level of the accreting diffuse gas , it nevertheless allows residual low ",
    "entropy clumps in the outskirts to survive the pre  heating , thus lowering the overall amplitude of the entropy profiles .",
    "an interesting characterisation of the effect of either increasing the wind speed or adding an entropy floor is obtained by comparing the star fraction with the corresponding specific extra energy involved by non  gravitational heating ( see table 2 ) . increasing the wind speed in the ` cluster ' runs has only a marginal effect on the entropy profiles , but it is quite effective in regulating cooling : the w3 model produces @xmath66 per cent fewer stars than the w1 model , bringing it into better agreement with observational data ( e.g. , lin , mohr & stanford 2003 ) which generally favour low stellar densities .",
    "quite interestingly , strong winds are at least as efficient as the s100 model in preventing overcooling , while requiring a lower amount of extra energy per gas particle .",
    "this highlights the different ways in which winds and an entropy floor affect the thermodynamics of the diffuse baryons .",
    "the former acts locally to increase the cooling time of the gas surrounding the star forming regions but it is inefficient in smoothing out the gas content of merging sub  halos .",
    "the latter provides a diffuse impulsive heating and provides for a much more efficient transition from smooth to diffuse accretion .",
    "a further question we investigated is whether the different feedback and pre  heating schemes are able to violate the self  similarity of the entropy profiles as strongly as it is observed . for this purpose ,",
    "we plot in figure  [ fi : redentr ] the profiles of reduced entropy , @xmath67 , for the four simulated structures in different radiative runs . since in this analysis",
    "we do not aim for a detailed comparison with observations , we here prefer to normalise the entropy to the mass  weighted temperature , @xmath68 , instead of using the emission  weighted temperature .",
    "the latter has been shown to provide an inaccurate measure for the spectroscopic temperature of the icm that is observationally inferred from x  ray spectra ( e.g. , mathiesen & evrard 2001 ; mazzotta et al .",
    "2004 ; vikhlinin 2005 ) .",
    "although cooling , star formation and sn feedback are likely to introduce characteristic scales in the icm thermodynamics , all the w1 runs have remarkably self  similar entropy profiles , over the whole range of resolved scales . however , for the w4 runs , the self ",
    "similarity is clearly broken in the central regions , while it is largely preserved at @xmath59 . over the range of scales where self  similarity is preserved",
    ", the slope of the entropy profiles is always consistent with the @xmath69 behaviour found by pratt & arnaud ( 2004 ) and piffaretti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) from their analysis of groups and clusters observed with xmm  newton .",
    "as expected , only the s100 entropy floor generates an appreciable breaking of self  similarity in the outer regions of the simulated structures . in the lower right panel of figure  [ fi : redentr ]",
    "we show the entropy profiles rescaled according to @xmath70 , which is consistent with the scaling suggested by observational data .",
    "quite ironically , while this time we are able to reproduce the scaling with temperature of the normalisation of the profiles , we lose the agreement with the radial slope , which is significantly shallower than the observed one .",
    "we note here that an accurate derivation of the icm entropy profiles from observations requires properly resolving both the gas density profiles and the temperature profiles . while different authors generally agree on the radial run of gas density , the temperature profiles are still a matter of vigorous debate .",
    "for instance , both asca ( e.g. , markevitch et al .",
    "1998 ; finoguenov et al .",
    "2001 ) and beppo  sax ( e.g. , de grandi & molendi 2002 ) consistently find decreasing profiles , at least for @xmath71 ( cf . also white 2000 ) .",
    "however , pratt & arnaud ( 2003 , 2004 ) find profiles consistent with being isothermal , at least outside the cooling regions .",
    "more recently , piffaretti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find decreasing outer profiles from xmm  newton and chandra data , respectively .",
    "while we do not intend to enter this debate here , we note that shallower entropy profiles should be obtained from data when the corresponding temperature profiles have a negative outer gradient .",
    "in this paper , we have analysed hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of one galaxy cluster and three galaxy groups , with the main aim of studying the ability of different models of non  gravitational heating to cause an amplification of entropy generation by accretion shocks as a consequence of a transition from clumpy to smooth accretion ( e.g. voit & ponman 2003 ) . for this purpose ,",
    "we have carried out non  radiative simulations as well as simulations with cooling and star formation , and combined those with two different models for non  gravitational heating .",
    "the extra heating has been supplied in two different forms : _ ( a ) _ by imposing an entropy floor at @xmath0 ; _ ( b ) _ by including the effect of galactic winds ( springel & hernquist 2003a ) of different strengths in the runs with star formation .",
    "the main results of our analysis give answers to the three questions posed in the introduction , and can be summarised as follows .",
    "( a ) : :    smoothing the accretion pattern by pre  heating in simulations with    non  radiative physics does indeed amplify the entropy generation out    to the radius where accretion shocks are taking place . as predicted by    semi",
    " analytic models ( voit et al . 2003 ) , this amplification is more    pronounced for lower  mass systems , because they accrete from smaller    sub  halos whose gas content is more easily smoothed by extra heating .",
    "( b ) : :    radiative cooling reduces this amplification effect by a significant    amount .",
    "cooling has the effect of increasing the clumpiness of the    accretion pattern , and thus acts against the smoothing induced by    extra heating .",
    "we find that only our pre  heating model with an entropy    floor @xmath65 kev @xmath24 generates a    sizable entropy amplification out to the external regions ,    @xmath72 ,    of group ",
    "sized halos .",
    "( c ) : :    the heating from galactic winds is efficient in regulating star    formation and in providing an increase of the icm entropy in the    central regions of groups .",
    "the winds have a negligible effect    in smoothing the accretion pattern and thus do not trigger an    appreciable entropy amplification effect .",
    "this result , which holds    also for the strongest winds considered in our analysis , indicates    that the role played by these winds tends to be fairly well localised    around the star forming regions and therefore hardly affects the gas    dynamics over the whole interior of dark matter halos .",
    "our results show that the temperature ",
    "entropy scaling provides powerful constraints on the physical nature of the energy feedback that affects the thermodynamic history of the diffuse baryons .",
    "smoothing the gas accretion pattern within halos of forming galaxy clusters requires a rather non  local feedback , whose action should not only be that of preventing gas overcooling .",
    "the difficulties faced by our model for galactic winds suggest that we may miss a proper description of physics which is able to distribute the sn energy in the diffuse medium more efficiently ( e.g. kay et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 , where cold galactic gas was impulsively heated to high temperature ) . alternatively ,",
    "this may be taken as an indication that other astrophysical sources of energy feedback are required . in this context ,",
    "the most obvious candidate are probably agn , whose effects should be taken into account self  consistently in future cosmological hydrodynamical simulations .    in this paper",
    ", we have not yet performed an in - depth comparison with observational data because we preferred to first provide a general interpretative framework for x  ray observations . however , a detailed comparison with observations in future work is very promising for extracting yet more information from the icm thermodynamics .",
    "particularly the increasing amount of high quality x ",
    "ray observations at the group scale ( e.g. finoguenov et al . 2004 ) together with the ever more sophisticated simulation models give a real hope that the intra  cluster baryons will remain an extremely useful tracer and will eventually allow us to understand the nature of feedback in groups and clusters .",
    "the simulations have been realized with cpu time allocated at the `` centro interuniversitario del nord - est per il calcolo elettronico '' ( cineca , bologna ) , thanks to grants from inaf and from the university of trieste .",
    "this work has been partially supported by the infn grant pd-51 .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with klaus dolag , giuseppe murante and luca tornatore .",
