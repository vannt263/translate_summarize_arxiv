    "in recent cosmological research work , the theoretical models and range of the cosmological parameters are tested continuously by the combination of different observational astrophysical data . before achieving supernova data",
    ", it seems that the universe may be occupied by energy density which is very well distributed over large scales @xcite . in 1992 ,",
    "cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) @xcite data suggested that the spectrum of standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) should be modified and proved the necessity of existence of the cosmological constant .",
    "the existence of non - zero cosmological constant @xmath21 ( which has the equation of state @xmath22 ) was supported in 1996 @xcite .",
    "the different cosmological observation of sneia @xcite , large scale redshift surveys @xcite , the measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and wmap @xcite anticipate that our present universe which is expanding with acceleration , preceded by a period of deceleration .",
    "the mysterious observational facts were not explained by the standard big bang cosmology with perfect fluid .",
    "thus to integrate the recent prediction from observational cosmology , a modification is necessary in the matter sector of the einstein gravity . the unknown candidate which is responsible for this accelerating scenario ,",
    "has the property that the positive energy density and sufficient negative pressure , known as dark energy @xcite .",
    "the scalar field or quintessence @xcite produce sufficient negative pressure to provoke acceleration in which the kinetic term is dominated by the potential . from recent cosmological observations including supernova data @xcite and measurements of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr )",
    "@xcite it is evident that in @xmath21cdm model the universe is made up of about @xmath23 26% matter ( baryonic + dark matter ) and @xmath23 74% of a smooth vacuum energy component . + for @xmath24 , the tonry data set with the 230 data points @xcite together with the 23 points from barris et al @xcite are valid .",
    "another data set named the `` gold '' sample ( see @xcite ) contains 156 points , which includes the latest points observed by hst and this covers the redshift range @xmath25 . recently",
    "the cmbr data ( for recent wmap results , see @xcite ) strongly support @xmath26 for frw universe in einstein gravity .",
    "also in @xmath27 , choudhury et al @xcite showed that the best - fit value of @xmath28 for flat model was @xmath29 .",
    "+ one of the most effective candidate of dark energy having positive energy density and negative pressure is chaplygin gas whose eos is given by @xmath30 @xcite with @xmath31 .",
    "later , it has been generalized to the form @xmath32 @xcite and thereafter modified to the form @xmath33 @xcite , which is known as modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) .",
    "the modified form of chaplygin gas go with the 3 year wmap and the sdss data with the choice of parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite which are improved constraints than the previous ones ( @xmath36 ) @xcite .",
    "+ the drawback of the gravitational force has been successfully explained by proposing the existence of more than three special dimensions @xcite .",
    "today , the existence of extra dimensions @xcite are supported by large number of promising model and theories .",
    "the solutions for mcg in @xmath0-dimensional frw cosmology are given in section ii . here , the table of @xmath37 and @xmath38 is presented for different values of @xmath4 . the @xmath10 minimum test for best fit values of parameters are investigated with stern and stern+bao joint data analysis in section iii .",

    "+ now we consider the universe is filled with modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) whose equation of state ( eos ) is given by @xcite    @xmath49    we also assume that the dark matter and dark energy are separately conserved .",
    "so the energy conservation equations in homogeneous higher dimensional cosmology are    @xmath50    and @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the hubble parameter defined as @xmath53 . from the first conservation equation ( 6 ) we have the solution of @xmath45 as    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the present value of the density of matter and @xmath56 is the cosmological redshift . from the second conservation equation ( 7 )",
    "we have the solution of the energy density @xmath46 as    @xmath57^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+1}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the integration constant which can be interpreted as one of the contribution of dark energy . now the equation ( 9 ) can be written as    @xmath58^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+1}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 is the present value of the dark energy density .",
    "we now investigate the expected bounds of the theoretical parameters by @xmath10 statistical best fit test with the basis of @xmath37-@xmath4 ( stern ) @xcite and stern+bao @xcite joint data analysis .",
