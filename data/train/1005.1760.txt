    "in finance , the style of an option is a general term denoting the class into which the option falls , usually defined by the dates on which the option may be exercised .",
    "an asian option is an option where the payoff is not determined by the underlying price at maturity , contrary to european or american - style options , but by the average underlying price over some pre - set period of time .",
    "such average - value options are commonly traded on some asian ( but also western ) markets being somehow advantageous over european ones since the risk of asset price manipulation near the maturity date is reduced due to their path dependence .    in classical black - scholes settings",
    "@xcite , the underlying asset on which the asian option is based is equal to a stock with price @xmath10 which follows the so - called geometric brownian motion . in other words",
    ", it is defined as the strong solution of the following linear stochastic differential equation : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the volatility of @xmath10 , @xmath13 is a standard one - dimensional brownian motion and @xmath14 is a constant dependent on the nature of the asset : it could be a stock , a currency , a commodity and etc .",
    "for example , if @xmath10 is a stock paying a dividend at the continuous rate @xmath15 , one has @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the risk - free rate of interest .",
    "resorting to it calculus , one solves ( [ bs ] ) to find @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the initial price and @xmath20 is a constant , which may be positive , equal to zero or negative .",
    "further on , for continuous averaging with equal time - independent weights , the random variable of interest - the value of an asian option - is defined as the following functional of a brownian trajectory  @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath0 is the maturity date and @xmath22 is the time moment when one starts to monitor the evolution of @xmath10 . without lack of generality , we set @xmath23 in what follows .    in this paper",
    "we pose the following question which is , we believe , of a considerable conceptual interest : suppose that one has not a single equation ( [ bs ] ) but , say , two such stochastic equations , having the same volatility , the same @xmath14 , the same initial price @xmath24 and random noise terms , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which have identic distributions .",
    "these two equations produce two identical european - style assets , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which , in turn , generate two identical asian - style random variables , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "what can be said about the distribution functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 of random variables : @xmath33 and @xmath34 these random variables describe a realization - dependent relative weight of one asset in the sum of two assets . noticing that @xmath27 ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath30 ) are obviously equal to each other on average , and moreover , that all their higher moments are equal , one might be tempted to say that the distribution functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 should be bell - shaped functions with a maximum at @xmath1",
    ". they may broaden ( initially both are delta - functions ) with growth of the maturity @xmath0 , but still @xmath36 and @xmath37 should remain the most probable values .    curiously , within the realm of the black - scholes model",
    "most often this is not the case .",
    "we set out to show here that the behavior of @xmath31 and @xmath32 is , in general , surprisingly different from these common - sense - based expectations .",
    "note first that @xmath38 ( and hence , @xmath31 ) is independent of @xmath39 , since the factors @xmath40 in the nominator and the denominator cancel each other .     in ( [ assets ] ) for different values of the effective maturity @xmath41 : dotted curve corresponds to @xmath42 , dashed - to @xmath43 , while dot - dashed one - to @xmath44 . ]    for uncorrelated increments @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the distribution function @xmath31 can be calculated exactly ( see appendix [ euro ] ) : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an effective maturity .",
    "this is the so - called logit - normal distribution , i.e. , a probability distribution of a random variable whose logit has a normal distribution @xcite .    despite a relatively simple form",
    ", @xmath31 in ( [ assets ] ) contains a surprise : it shows a markedly different behavior for @xmath41 less or greater than @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath48 the distribution has a maximum at @xmath36 , which means that at early stages both @xmath49 and @xmath50 contribute proportionally ; it is thus most likely that each variable defines just one half of the sum .",
    "however , when @xmath41 exceeds @xmath1 , @xmath31 changes its shape from a unimodal to a bimodal , @xmath51-shaped form with @xmath52 and maximal values progressively closer to @xmath6 and @xmath7 as @xmath53 .",
    "strikingly , @xmath36 is now the _",
    "least _ probable value .",
    "it means that at sufficiently large maturities the symmetry breaks and one of the variables completely dominates the sum , while the second one becomes a complete loser .",
    "certainly , this is not the behavior one may expect on intuitive grounds .",
    "let @xmath54 denote the distribution function of @xmath55 variables in ( [ tauvar ] ) .",
    "then , for two uncorrelated asian - style variables the probability density @xmath32 can be written as ( see appendix [ asian ] ) : @xmath56 clearly , @xmath32 is symmetric around @xmath37 . the question is whether @xmath37 is always the maximum of the distribution ?",
    "the form of the distribution function @xmath54 was discussed in the literature on mathematical finance [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "in addition , such @xmath55 variables appear in different domains of probability theory : they are the continuous counterparts of the so - called kesten variables @xcite that play an important role in multiplicative stochastic processes and in the renewal theory for products of random matrices . in the physical literature ,",
    "variables @xmath55 emerge in different contexts related to transport in disordered media .",
    "in particular , @xmath55 defines a resistance of a finite interval of length @xmath0 offered to a passage @xcite of particles diffusing in presence of a random , time - independent gaussian force with average value @xmath57 and variance @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "consequently , inverse moments of @xmath55 define the moments of stationary currents through the interval boundaries . within this context",
    ", moments of @xmath55 @xcite and the distribution function @xmath54 @xcite were also calculated exactly .    for arbitrary @xmath39 ,",
    "@xmath54 is determined by @xcite : @xmath59 with @xmath60 [ discrete ] and @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 are generalized laguerre polynomials , @xmath65 is the gamma function , and @xmath66 are whittaker functions @xcite . for @xmath67 the distribution function in ( [ general ] )",
    "consists of discrete [ @xmath68 and continuous branches [ @xmath69 , while for @xmath70 the distribution is determined by the continuous branch only .",
    "hence , unlike the distribution of @xmath38 , @xmath32 will depend on the sign ( and value ) of @xmath39 .",
    "consequently , we will consider the cases of positive and negative @xmath39 separately",
    ".      in this marginal case @xmath55 defines an inverse probability current in a finite sinai chain @xcite . occasionally , for this case the distribution @xmath32 has been already calculated in @xcite , which studied the probability that a partially melted heteropolymer at the melting temperature will either denaturate completely or return back to a native helix state .",
    "here @xmath72 defines the so - called splitting probability @xcite - the probability that the boundary between the helix and coil phases ( which performs sinai - type diffusion @xcite ) will first hit one of the extremities of the chain without having ever reached the second extremity .    adapting to our notations the result of @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath73 @xmath74    , ( [ dist3 ] ) , for @xmath75 ( dashed curve ) , @xmath76 ( dotted ) , and @xmath77 ( dash - dotted ) .",

    "[ pe - exact ] we plot @xmath32 for several values of an effective maturity @xmath41 . for sufficiently low values of @xmath41 the distribution is unimodal and centered around @xmath37 .",
    "hence , in this early - time regime both options equally contribute to the total asset .",
    "however , if we allow the options to  mature  longer , we observe the same surprising _ anomaly _ , which we have already encountered in the previous section : when @xmath41 reaches a critical value @xmath78 , the maximum at @xmath37 ceases to exist and the distribution becomes close to uniform for @xmath79 .",
    "thus any value of @xmath72 in this range is nearly equally probable . for @xmath41 exceeding @xmath80 ,",
    "two maxima emerge continuously and the distribution changes its shape becoming @xmath51-shaped bimodal , with most probable values close to @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "although the _ average _ value @xmath72 is still equal to @xmath1 in this regime , the probability density now has a _ minimum _ at @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath71 the path - dependence of the asian - style variables does not suppress the transition to the disproportionate behavior but only shifts it to later times ; @xmath80 is more than three times larger than the corresponding value for the european - style variables .      in this case",
    "the distribution function in ( [ general ] ) converges @xcite , as @xmath53 , to a limiting form defined by the first term of a discrete branch , @xmath81 hence , for @xmath82 the variable @xmath55 has a very broad distribution characterized by a  fat  algebraic tail . for @xmath83",
    "this distribution is normalized but does not have moments .",
    "we do not attempt here to present an exact solution for @xmath32 for arbitrary @xmath67 and arbitrary @xmath41 . instead , our aim will be to get a conceptual understanding whether @xmath32 undergoes , at a certain unknown value of @xmath41 , a transition from a unimodal to a bimodal form .",
    "this question can be immediately answered if we find that the corresponding limiting form of @xmath32 exhibits such a transition .",
    "plugging the limiting form in ( [ discrete_first ] ) into ( [ dist ] ) and performing integrations , we find that in the limit @xmath53 , the probability density @xmath32 converges to a limiting form @xmath84 i.e. , it tends to a beta - distribution .",
    "the distribution on the right - hand - side of ( [ lim ] ) has a different shape ( modality ) for @xmath85 , @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "for @xmath85 the distribution @xmath88 is a @xmath89-shaped bimodal . for @xmath86",
    "it is uniform .",
    "finally , @xmath88 is unimodal , centered at @xmath90 for @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath85 the distribution @xmath32 will change its shape from a unimodal to a bimodal at a certain value @xmath80 . for the marginal @xmath86 case ,",
    "the distribution @xmath32 will tend to a uniform distribution as @xmath53 .",
    "finally , for @xmath87 , the distribution will always remain unimodal and centered around the most probable value @xmath37 .",
    "note that a similar transition was observed for the distribution of the occupation time on the positive axis for sinai model with a drift @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this transition also occurs for @xmath86 .      in this case the distribution @xmath54 is given by the continuous branch in ( [ general ] ) .",
    "note that the expression in ( [ general ] ) can not be used directly , since it does not allow one to perform an integration over @xmath55 in ( [ dist ] ) .",
    "thus , we will first try to obtain a plausible approximation for @xmath54 valid for large @xmath41 , which will allow us to perform the integration over @xmath55 .",
    "then , on base of this result we will see whether the transition to the disproportionate behavior indeed takes place or not .",
    "after some straightforward manipulations ( see appendix [ asian<0 ] ) , we find @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a constant ( see appendix [ asian<0 ] ) and @xmath94 is the confluent hypergeometric function @xcite .",
    "note that for sufficiently large @xmath41 the approximation in ( [ app ] ) works fairly well for any value of @xmath55 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_comparison_psi ] in appendix [ asian<0 ] ) .",
    "moreover , it exhibits exact asymptotic behaviors in the limits @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    equation ( [ app ] ) predicts that @xmath54 has a log - normal tail as @xmath96 .",
    "given such a slow decay , one expects that the integral in ( [ dist ] ) is dominated by large values of @xmath97 .",
    "one finds then that , for sufficiently large @xmath41 , and @xmath72 not too close to @xmath6 or @xmath7 , @xmath98 while for @xmath99 or @xmath7 one finds that @xmath100 obeys ( [ assets ] ) ( with possible logarithmic corrections , see appendix [ asian=0 ] , ( [ as1 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , for @xmath91 the distribution @xmath100 does not reach a limiting form when @xmath53 .",
    "this means , in turn , that _ for all _ @xmath91 , the distribution @xmath101 exhibits a generic transition from a bell - shaped to an @xmath51-shaped form , as @xmath41 passes through some critical value @xmath80 .",
    "in fact , this is a rather counter - intuitive result .",
    "the random variables @xmath102 are integrals of a geometric brownian motion - an exponential of a symmetric brownian motion plus a constant drift term @xmath103 .",
    "one may naturally expect that for sufficiently large @xmath39 a contribution due to symmetric brownian motion will be insignificant .",
    "this is precisely the behavior we observed in the @xmath67 case , for which the transition to the disproportionate behavior takes place only for @xmath104 and is absent for @xmath87 .",
    "surprisingly , this is not the case for @xmath91 and `` disorder '' embodied in brownian terms @xmath13 turns out to be always relevant , despite the fact that the constant drift term clearly provides a dominant contribution ( for sufficiently large @xmath39 ) in the exponential .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of the race between two uncorrelated asian - style random variables [ see ( [ rw ] , [ tau_num ] ) below ] which confirm our conclusions on the transition to a disproportionate behavior for any @xmath91 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_muneg_uncorrel ] we plot @xmath100 for @xmath105 for three different values of the maturity @xmath41 , which clearly shows a transition from a unimodal to an @xmath51-shaped form , as the maturity exceeds a critical value @xmath106 .",
    "guided by the above analytic argument ( [ approx_m ] ) , we have fitted these distributions using the expression for the european - style variable , @xmath31 in ( [ assets ] ) , in which we replaced @xmath41 by some effective maturity @xmath107 used as a fitting parameter .",
    "as one may notice , the quality of the fit in fig .",
    "[ fig_muneg_uncorrel ] is very good .",
    "we also found numerically that @xmath108 is a slowly decreasing function of @xmath39 for @xmath91 , which implies that the larger , ( by absolute value ) @xmath39 is , the earlier the transition takes place .     obtained from numerical simulations ( symbols ) of the race between two uncorrelated asian - style variables for for @xmath105 and for two different maturities @xmath42 ( a bell - shaped curve ) and @xmath109 ( an @xmath51-shaped curve ) .",

    "the dashed lines correspond to a fit according to ( [ assets ] ) with @xmath41 replaced with a fitting parameter @xmath107 .",
    "[ fig_muneg_uncorrel ] ]",
    "so far we have concentrated on the case of independent variables , to which one may object claiming that such a transition is spurious and correlations @xcite between the increments @xmath110 and @xmath111 will `` stabilize '' the behavior of the european- and/or the asian - style variables . in the remainder , we proceed to show that the transition to the bimodal shape is robust and the only effect of correlations is to shift the transition to later times .",
    "we focus on the case of very strongly correlated increments , when the penalty for having different @xmath110 and @xmath111 grows with @xmath112 as @xmath113 . in this case",
    "the distribution function of the increments reads : @xmath114 physically , it corresponds to the situation of two brownian particles coupled by a hookean spring with rigidity @xmath115 .",
    "the parameter @xmath116 sets the scale of correlations .",
    "when @xmath117 ( an infinite rigidity of the spring ) , the function @xmath118 in ( [ gauss ] ) converges to a delta - function which signifies that the increments are forced to be equal to each other , @xmath119 .",
    "conversely , when @xmath116 is large , the function @xmath118 in ( [ gauss ] ) will tolerate large deviations of @xmath111 from @xmath110 .",
    "for @xmath120 we recover the limit of independent variables .    for @xmath118 in ( [ gauss ] ) ,",
    "the distribution function @xmath31 of the random variable @xmath38 can be calculated exactly ( see appendix [ corr ] ) : @xmath121 and appears to have essentially the same form as the result for two _ uncorrelated _ european - style variables , ( [ assets ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that now @xmath41 is renormalized by @xmath116 , so that the transition to the bimodal form occurs at @xmath122 .",
    "hence , in presence of correlations the transition to the bimodal form is postponed for later times .    for correlated asian options , analytic calculations are much more involved and here",
    "we again resort to numerical analysis . to this purpose ,",
    "we first generate two random walks @xmath123 and @xmath124 which evolve according to the following rules ( in discrete time ) : @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 ^ 2\\right ) = { ( 1+\\chi^2)}/{(2+\\chi^2)}$ ] .",

    "one can then compute the distribution @xmath100 . by varying the parameters @xmath116 and @xmath39 we obtain the phase diagram which is depicted in fig . [ phase_diag ] .",
    "this is achieved as follows :    * for @xmath87 , we have shown previously that even in the absence of correlations , ( which corresponds to @xmath143 ) , the distribution @xmath100 is always unimodal so that it will remain unimodal for any finite value of @xmath116 . in this case",
    "we have checked numerically that the distribution @xmath100 converges to a @xmath144-independent , unimodal curve for @xmath144 in ( [ tau_num ] ) sufficiently large . * for @xmath85 and @xmath143 ,",
    "we have shown that the shape of @xmath100 changes from a bell - shaped to a @xmath89-shaped form as @xmath145 passes through a critical value @xmath146 , which we have numerically verified . for finite but sufficiently large @xmath116 , @xmath147",
    "we continue to observe such a transition as @xmath144 crosses a critical value @xmath148 , where @xmath149 increases as @xmath116 is decreased , and eventually @xmath149 diverges when @xmath150 . for @xmath151",

    "we have checked numerically that the `` critical region '' is very narrow , in the sense that @xmath149 grows very rapidly when @xmath153 , which thus allows for a reliable estimate of the critical line depicted as a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] in the @xmath154 plane .",
    "note , however , that a precise estimate of this critical line would certainly require a more careful analysis . * for @xmath91",
    "we observe instead a transition from an @xmath51-shaped to a bell - shaped form of the distribution but the effect of correlations is qualitatively similar to the case @xmath85 .",
    "the critical line is identified as described above for @xmath85 .",
    "this phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] can be summarized as follows . for finite @xmath116 , we find that @xmath100 always undergoes a transition from a unimodal to a bimodal form as the maturity passes through a critical value @xmath80 for all @xmath155 .",
    "as we expected , @xmath156 is a decreasing function of the strength of correlations : this is shown by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] . similarly to the uncorrelated case , one also finds a different behavior for @xmath157 and @xmath91 : in the first case , @xmath100 changes from a bell - shaped to a @xmath89-shaped form , while for @xmath91 it changes from a bell - shaped to an @xmath51-shaped form .",
