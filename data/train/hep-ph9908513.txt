    "the results of solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments have been analyzed by several groups ( see @xcite and references therein ) under the assumption of transitions into active neutrinos ( @xmath7 for solar neutrinos and @xmath8 or @xmath9 for atmospheric neutrinos ) or into sterile neutrinos ( @xmath10 for solar neutrinos and @xmath11 for atmospheric neutrinos ) .",
    "however , in the case of four - neutrino mixing transitions into active and sterile neutrinos can take place simultaneously for both solar and atmospheric neutrinos . in this paper",
    "we present a formalism for the calculation of the transition probabilities into active and sterile neutrinos of solar @xmath3 s and atmospheric @xmath4 s , taking into account the matter effects in the sun and in the earth ( see ) .",
    "the derivation of this formalism follows a method similar to the one used to develop the formalism that describes neutrino oscillations in the framework of three - neutrino mixing .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that there are only two schemes with four - neutrino mixing that can accommodate the results of all neutrino oscillation experiments : @xmath12 these two spectra are characterized by the presence of two pairs of close masses separated by a gap of about 1 ev which provides the mass - squared difference @xmath13 responsible for the oscillations observed in the lsnd experiment . in the scheme",
    "a , we have @xmath14 and @xmath15 , whereas in scheme b , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations in these two schemes is identical .",
    "hence , for simplicity we shall consider in the following only the scheme b , but all the results are also valid in the scheme a and can be obtained by the exchange @xmath18 of the mass eigenstate indices .",
    "the mass spectrum is characterized by the hierarchy @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the upper bound @xmath21 for the effective number of neutrinos in big  bang nucleosynthesis implies that @xmath22 in the scheme b is very small . in this case ,",
    "atmospheric neutrinos oscillate only in the @xmath8 channel and solar neutrino oscillate only in the @xmath10 channel .",
    "however , the value of the upper bound for @xmath23 is rather controversial @xcite and some authors argue that @xmath23 could be larger than four .",
    "moreover , a large value of @xmath22 may be compatible with the upper bound @xmath21 if a large lepton asymmetry is generated by @xmath24 oscillations at times much earlier than the time of big  bang nucleosynthesis @xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not put any constraint on the possible value of @xmath22 .",
    "a global analysis of all neutrino oscillation data with the formalism presented here could lead to the determination of the values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which regulate the neutrino oscillations occurring in the early universe .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ matter effects ] we introduce the general formulas for the description of neutrino oscillations in matter in four - neutrino schemes ; in section [ solar neutrinos ] we derive the survival probability of solar @xmath3 s and the probabilities of @xmath10 and @xmath7 transitions in the sun ; in section [ regeneration ] we discuss the regeneration of solar @xmath3 s in the earth ; in section [ atmospheric neutrinos ] we present the formalism for the description of the oscillations of high - energy atmospheric neutrinos in the earth ; in section [ long - baseline experiments ] we derive the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos in long - baseline experiments ; in section [ conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "in a four - neutrino mixing scheme , the flavor neutrino fields @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) are related to the fields @xmath29 of neutrinos with masses @xmath30 by the relation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a @xmath33 unitary mixing matrix . neglecting possible cp phases ,",

    "we will see that in order to study matter effects in the oscillations of the solar and atmospheric neutrinos , it is convenient to use different parameterizations of the mixing matrix @xmath32 .",
    "the evolution of the amplitudes @xmath37 ( @xmath28 ) of the neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath38 in matter is governed by the msw equation @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( for example , apart from a phase , @xmath41 , etc . ) and @xmath42 is the effective hamiltonian @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the neutrino momentum , @xmath45 is the mass - squared matrix in the flavor basis , @xmath46 with @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the matrix @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( see ) . here",

    "because the solar neutrino oscillations are due to the mass - squared difference @xmath75 , a convenient parameterization of the mixing matrix @xmath32 for studying the matter effects is @xmath76 furthermore , it is convenient to work in the rotated basis @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 here @xmath80 ( @xmath72 ) are the amplitudes of the rotated neutrino states @xmath81 .",

    "indeed , for @xmath98 in the lsnd allowed region , the results of the bugey @xmath95 disappearance experiment @xcite imply that @xmath99 therefore , in the following we neglect the two small angles @xmath96 and @xmath97 whose contribution to the solar neutrino transitions is negligible .",
    "let us , however , emphasize that although @xmath96 and @xmath97 are both small , at least one of the two must be different from zero in order to generate the @xmath100 and @xmath101 oscillations observed in the lsnd experiment , whose amplitude is @xmath102 @xcite .    with the approximation @xmath103 , the mixing matrix reduces to @xmath104 and its explicit form is @xmath105 with @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
