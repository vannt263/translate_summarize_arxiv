    "the ( soft ) breaking of susy , around the @xmath2 scale , brings about two new ingredients compared to the standard electroweak theory ( sm ) : first , there are novel sources of flavor violation coming through the off  diagonal entries of the squark mass matrices .",
    "second , there are novel sources of cp violation coming from the phases of the soft masses . the first effect , which can not be determined theoretically , is strongly constrained by the fcnc data @xcite , and therefore , as a predictive case , it is convenient to restrict all flavor  violating transitions to the charged  current interactions where they proceed via the known ckm angles .",
    "however , this very restriction of the flavor violation to the sm one does not evade new sources of cp violation .",
    "indeed , the model possesses various flavor ",
    "odd phases contained in the complex @xmath3 parameter , @xmath4 parameters , and gauge fermion masses @xmath5 .",

    "therefore , it is of fundamental importance to determine appropriate collider processes where all or some of the susy cp phases can be inferred or measured .",

    "we will discuss the chargino - pair production at lhc energies and ways of isolating the phase of the @xmath3 parameter from the cross section .",
    "due to the large energy and high luminosity of incoming protons , lhc is a very useful machine to detect charginos .",
    "the dominant production mechanism for chargino pairs at a hadron collider is the quark - antiquark annihilation . in this sense ,",
    "the number of chargino pair production events differ from @xmath0 to @xmath6 colliders . in what follows",
    "we will compute the cross section for @xmath7 as a function of @xmath8 $ ] for various values of @xmath9 and the su(2 ) gaugino mass @xmath10 . as the analyses of edms @xcite make it clear the effects of susy cp phases",

    "the more spectacular enhancement implies the lighter chargino mass .",
    "the decrease of the cross section is tied up to the variation of the chargino masses with the phases .",
    "it is clear that as @xmath147 the mass splitting of the charginos decrease .",
    "this is an important effect which implies that the cross section is larger than what one would expect from the cp  conserving theory @xcite .",

    "the dependence of the normal polarization on the value of @xmath158 and @xmath159  is shown in fig .",
    "7 , where the normal polarization has its maximum at @xmath160 as expected from the equation 24 , and at @xmath161 as stated above .",
    "we believe that for clarifying the essence of measuring @xmath162 the first quantity to be tested is the cross section itself .",
    "we have analyzed the production of chargino pairs at lhc energies at the aim of isolating the phase of the @xmath3 parameter .",
    "our results ( figs",
    ". 2 - 3 ) suggest that , there is a strong dependence on the phase of the @xmath3 parameter .",
    "the cross section is minimum for the value of the phase @xmath163 .",
    "this result is understandable since the mass of the lightest ( heaviest ) chargino makes a maximum ( minimum ) at this point .",
    "it is particularly clear that @xmath164 production rate is depleted in this region .",
    "the size and dependence on @xmath165 of the cross section both get enhanced for small enough soft masses , @xmath44 @xmath10=150 gev and @xmath1=150 gev . as an example , this is seen for the value of @xmath163 , @xmath166 when @xmath10=150 gev and @xmath1=150 gev and for the same value of @xmath60 , @xmath167 when @xmath10=150 gev and @xmath1=300 gev .",
    "the physical chargino mass increases as the values of @xmath10 and @xmath1 increase .",
    "the cross section values that we have obtained for @xmath134 process at the lhc can reach a few 10 @xmath168 , whereas for the @xmath169 pair productions , the cross sections are in the range of a few @xmath168 . having an annual luminosity of 100 @xmath170 , one may accumulate @xmath171 and 100 events per year for @xmath172 and @xmath169 pair productions respectively .",
    "this is a hard task to obtain a clean signature , but the measurement of these processes will be an important step for determining the cp violation sources of low  energy supersymmetry .",

    "in fact , it is more likely to see chargino pairs at such @xmath6 colliders than at the lhc .",
    "this follows from the fact that the anti - quarks needed for chargino pair production are always drained from the sea for @xmath0 colliders . in this sense",
    "our analysis puts a lower bound on the likelihood of observing chargino pairs at hadron colliders . in this respect , the proton - antiproton collider tevatron and , to a greater extent ,",
    "the proton - proton collider lhc , are the almost ideal places of probing such a minimal susy scenario of explicit cp violation .    in fig .",

    "in true experimental environment , the cross sections we have studied are for subprocess obtained by integration over appropriate structure functions .",
    "however , given the energy span of lhc that it will be possible to probe sparticles up to @xmath184 , it is clear that the center  of  mass energies we discuss are always within the experimental reach .",
    "if the experiment concludes @xmath185 then , given strong bounds from the absence of permanent edms for electron , neutron , atoms and molecules , one would conclude that the first two generations of sfermions will be hierarchically split from the ones in the third generation . in case",
    "the experiment reports a small @xmath165 then presumably all sfermion generations can lie right at the weak scale in agreement with the edm bounds . in this case , where @xmath165 is a small fraction of @xmath186 , one might expect that the minimal model is uv  completed above the tev scale such that the @xmath1 parameter is promoted to a dynamical sm",
