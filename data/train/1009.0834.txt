    "the enhancement of mixing by stirring in incompressible flows is an important phenomenon in the natural sciences and in engineering applications .",
    "a natural question to pose is , how efficient a mixer can an incompressible flow be ?",
    "this fundamental question , more precisely posed , is the subject of this paper .    in principle , given an appropriate quantitative measure of mixing along with suitable constraints on the accessible class of flow fields , the most efficient mixing strategy may be determined by solving an optimal control problem . in practice",
    "this may be difficult , so it is useful to consider other approaches that might more easily be implemented , at least theoretically or computationally .",
    "moreover , it is always useful to know absolute limits on how fast mixing could ever be achieved subject to the relevant constraints .",
    "such bounds provide a scale upon which particular strategies may be evaluated to gauge their effectiveness . here",
    "we propose and analyze a theoretical scenario with a particular mixing measure subject to particular constraints where these issues can be investigated analytically and via direct numerical simulation .",
    "as will be seen , there is an interesting gap between the best available _ a priori _ analysis and the simulation results .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the basic notions and define the specific problems to be studied .",
    "rigorous bounds on the rate at which mixing measures can decay for constrained stirring flows are derived in section 3 , and an optimal mixing strategy is described in section 4 . in the final section 5",
    "we report computational implementations of the optimal strategy and discuss open challenges suggested by the results .",
    "consider the advection of a passive scalar field @xmath2 by a smooth incompressible flow field @xmath3 described by the partial differential equation _",
    "t+ = 0 [ mastereq ] along with initial condition @xmath4 .",
    "the stirring field @xmath5 and the initial distribution @xmath6 are periodic in the @xmath7-dimensional domain @xmath8^d$ ] so the subsequent solution @xmath9 is as well . without loss of generality",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath9 are spatially mean - zero : ( , t)_[0,l]^d(,t)d=0",
    ". we also restrict attention to spatially mean - zero flows , i.e. , @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "the goal of effective stirring is to redistribute the passive tracer density to achieve a maximal rate of mixing as quantified by the relevant mixing measure . to gauge the effectiveness of the stirring",
    "we adopt as a mixing measure the @xmath0 norm on mean - zero functions where , for any real parameter @xmath12 , the @xmath13 norm is a weighted sum of fourier coefficients of the scalar field : ( , t)_h^-a^2 | |^-a(,t)_l^2 ^ 2 = _ 0k^-2a|_(t)|^2 [ def_h_1 ] where @xmath14 and _ ( t ) = _ [ 0,l]^d e^-i ( , t ) d. the operator @xmath15 generally acts in fourier space as multiplication by @xmath16 although when @xmath12 is an odd integer @xmath17 is naturally defined as multiplication by @xmath18 .",
    "we focus in particular on the @xmath0 norm which is related to the large - scale mixing measure previously studied by a subset of the authors  @xcite .",
    "it measures the variance of a low - pass - filtered image of the concentration field : the smaller the @xmath0 norm is , the more homogeneous the scalar field is on large spatial scales . in many applications molecular diffusion , implemented mathematically by an additional @xmath19 term on the right hand side of the equation ( [ mastereq ] ) , dissipates the variance , i.e. , the @xmath20 norm , of the scalar field .",
    "but even in the absence of molecular diffusion when the @xmath20 norm is conserved , or when the diffusion is ineffective on the length and time scales of interest , the relatively large - scale structures in the scalar field may nevertheless decay when a ` mix norm ' like the @xmath0 norm is employed .",
    "this idea was introduced by @xcite for the @xmath21 norm and is extended to other norms here .",
    "for @xmath22 the norms @xmath13 provide a quantitative measure of mixing in the sense of ergodic theory . to see this consider lagrangian particle trajectories @xmath23 defined by = ( ( t),t ) with random initial condition @xmath24 distributed according to the density @xmath25 . then the tracer particle positions are distributed according to the solution @xmath26 of _ t + = 0 with initial condition @xmath25 .",
    "incompressible advection conserves the variance of @xmath26 : the mean - zero field @xmath27 also satisfies the advection equation , and multiplying ( [ mastereq ] ) by @xmath9 , integrating over the domain , and integrating by parts yields  @xmath28 .",
    "hence the variance of the density does not measure mixing .",
    "rather , the stirring field @xmath3 is called _ mixing _ if for every periodic square - integrable function @xmath29 on @xmath8^d$ ] , _",
    "t  _ [ 0,l]^d g ( ) ( , t)d  =  g .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the utility of the @xmath13 norms ( [ def_h_1 ] ) are indicated by the following theorem , an extension of @xcite .",
    "* theorem : * suppose the spatially mean - zero function @xmath2 is bounded uniformly in @xmath30^d)$ ] for all @xmath31",
    ". then @xmath32^d } g({\\bm{x}})\\ , \\theta({\\bm{x}},t)\\ , d{\\bm{x } } = 0 \\ \\ \\forall",

    "the upshot is that more rapid self - averaging characteristic of the intuitive notion of mixing is indicated by more rapid decay of the @xmath13 norm .",
    "alternative measures have also been used to characterize mixing and the associated control problem .",
    "see , for example ,  @xcite . the @xmath0 norm adopted here",
    ", however , allows for the development of a particularly straightforward and operational stirring strategy .",
    "constraints must be imposed upon on the available flow fields in order to formulate an optimization problem .",
    "we focus on constraints of bounded instantaneous kinetic energy , proportional to the @xmath33 norm of the velocity @xmath34 , or bounded instantaneous power dissipation in the flow , which for newtonian fluids with periodic boundary conditions is proportional to the @xmath35 norm of the velocity @xmath36 .",
    "that is , we consider flow fields @xmath5 satisfying either _ [ 0,l]^d|(,t)|^2  = u^2 l^d [ fixecons ] or _",
    "[ 0,l]^d|(,t)|^2  = _ [ 0,l]^d _ i , j=1^d ( _ i u_j+_j u_i)^2  =   [ fixpcons ] defining , respectively , the root - mean - square velocity @xmath37 or rate of strain @xmath38 of the stirring . given either constraint",
    "two natural questions are :    1 .",
    "what flow _ minimizes _ the mixing measure evaluated at a final time @xmath39 ?",
    "what flow _ maximizes _ the instantaneous decay rate of the mixing measure ?",
    "these questions have different answers implying different ` optimal ' stirring strategies .",
    "@xcite studied problem ( i ) and solved it numerically for a limited set of flow field configurations using the @xmath21 norm as the mixing measure .",
    "they computed the controls in the form of a time varying linear combination of two simple cellular flows .",
    "that approach is global in time since it requires keeping track of the complete evolutionary history of the system within the interval @xmath40 $ ] .    in this paper",
    "we address question ( ii ) and consider flows that produce the steepest descent of the @xmath0 mixing measure at each instant in time .",
    "this local - in - time strategy identifies an optimal mixing flow @xmath3 at time @xmath41 using only a snapshot of the scalar field @xmath2 at that instant .",
    "it should be noted that for the optimization problem ( i ) seeking to minimize the mixing measure at a final time , natural constraints might also be the total action ( the integral of @xmath42 from @xmath43 to @xmath44 ) or the total energy ( proportional to the time integral of @xmath45 from @xmath43 to @xmath44 ) .",
    "as a starting point it is useful to identify absolute limits on the rate at which scalar fields might be mixed by fluids satisfying the instantaneous energy or power constraints . toward this end we note that incompressible advection conserves not only the variance of @xmath9 but also that the ( weak ) maximum principle ensures that the @xmath46 norm ( the supremum of @xmath47 over the spatial domain ) is conserved as well , i.e. , @xmath48 at every time @xmath31 .    first consider the fixed energy constraint ( [ fixecons ] ) . multiplying ( [ mastereq ] ) by @xmath49 , integrating over the spatial domain , and integrating by parts implies ^-1_l^2 ^ 2 = _ h^-1 ^ 2 = -2 ( ^-1 )",

    "u l^d/2 _ 0_l^ _ h^-1 , [ bnd1a ] and dividing both sides by @xmath50 and integrating in time yields @xmath51 this rigorous estimate does not rule out perfect mixing as measured by the @xmath0 norm after a finite time , but it does bound the absolute minimum mixing time from below by t _  =   =  , singling out a length scale l_0 = 2  ( l   characterizing the spatial extent or ` size ' of initial inhomogeneities in the scalar field .",
    "the lower bound in ( [ bnd3 ] ) simply states that under the constant energy constraint , the time it takes to achieve complete mixing is at least as long as the time it takes to transport scalar inhomogeneities across the characteristic distance @xmath52 at the rms speed @xmath53 of the flow . whether or not this limiting mixing rate can actually be achieved , or even approached , by any suitably constrained",
    "stirring flow remains to be seen .",
    "the analysis is rather different for flows subject to the fixed power constraint ( [ fixpcons ] ) . for convenience",

    "the linear dependence of @xmath63 on @xmath64 is not surprising .",
    "this rigorous estimate is , however , more than nave dimensional analysis because the lower bound on the mixing time allows for a nontrivial @xmath65-dependence .",
    "the minimal mixing time estimate in ( [ tmp3 ] ) suggests that the availability of larger _ domain _",

    "in contrast to these potentially finite - time mixing scenarios , if the flow field is constrained to have a _ uniformly _ bounded ( in space and time ) rate of strain then it can decay at most exponentially . in any spatial dimension if @xmath74 then _ h^-1 ^ 2 = 2 ^-1 ( ) ^-1 d  -2 _ h^-1",

    "therefore if there is any real precision regarding the @xmath65-dependence in the estimates ( [ tmp3 ] ) or ( [ tmp2 ] ) then it depends crucially on a fixed - power flow s freedom to locally intensify the strain .",
    "recalling ( [ bnd1 ] ) we write ^-1 ^ 2_2=-2 ( ) = -2 ( ) [ mainfcnal ] where @xmath75 is the projector onto divergence - free fields defined by ( ) = - ^-1 ( ) . then with either the fixed energy ( [ fixecons ] ) or fixed enstrophy ( [ fixpcons ] ) constraints it is easy to see that the optimal mixer maximizing the rate of decay of the mix - norm @xmath0 is _",

    "so long as the relevant optimal stirring exists , the ideal instantaneous stirring strategy is to implement it at each instant of time .",
    "but if either of the norms in the denominators vanishes then @xmath76 throughout the domain and _ no _ incompressible flow can instantaneously decrease the mix - norm @xmath0 .",
    "a sufficient ( but not to our knowledge necessary ) condition for such degeneracies is that the scalar field @xmath9 satisfies = f ( ) , which includes cases where @xmath9 is an eigenfunction of the laplacian .",
    "such situations arise naturally as convenient initial conditions but we suspect that they are non - generic distributions among solutions of the advection equation .",
    "nevertheless when and if this situation develops some other strategy must be adopted to stir the fluid .",
    "the natural thing to do when @xmath76 is find the flow that maximizes the rate of increase of the rate of decrease of the norm .",
    "that is , seek the flow that minimizes ^2_h^-1 = 2 .",
    "the optimal incompressible @xmath5 here solves the eigenvalue problem = ( ( ) + ( ) -2[^-1 ( ) ] ) [ eigfixe ] for fixed energy constraint or = -^-1 ( ( ) + ( ) -2[^-1 ( ) ] ) [ eigfixp ] for fixed power constraint . in either case",
    "we seek the eigenvector ( field ) corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue @xmath77 to use as the stirring field momentarily until @xmath78 .",

    "a robust exponential decay of the @xmath0 norms emerges . in order to compare with the two - component flow optimal control results of @xcite we also computed the @xmath21 norm that they utilized and reported .",
    "not unexpectedly , expanding the set of available flows from two possibilities to everything within the constant power constraint allows for faster mixing .",
    "nevertheless the local - in - time optimization strategy employed here leaves room for further improvement .",
    "the conserved @xmath33 norm was also monitored as a numerical check .    to check for a possible dependence of the mixing rate on @xmath97 we also considered different initial data , and the results",
    "are displayed in figure [ h_1atdiffl0 ] .",
    "as is evident , the mixing scheme generates robust exponential decay of the mix - norm .",
    "exponential decay at a rate independent of the initial data is the sort of dynamics that might be expected for a uniform boundedness constraint on the rate of strain , but not the finite - time mixing that the best available analysis allows for when only the root - mean - square rate of strain is bounded .",
    "it is possible that the rigorous analysis may only be saturated by a global - in - time , i.e. , optimal control , stirring strategy but this discrepancy between rigorous analysis and simulation constitutes a major open question .",
