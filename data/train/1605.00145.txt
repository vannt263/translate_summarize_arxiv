    "supramolecular species in which a guest atom or molecule is inserted in the interior of a host molecule ( usually fullerenes ) , are known as endohedral compounds , and form systems that are bound by the pure confinement rather than by intra - molecular forces .",
    "the first endohedral compounds obtained consisted of trapped metal atoms @xcite followed by endofullerenes with a trapped molecule @xcite .",
    "these systems display a full gamut of quantum effects , because the confinement of the molecule results in the splitting of the translational degrees of freedom of the incarcerated molecule center of mass and their coupling with roto - vibrational ones . a fundamental breakthrough that has allowed",
    "the application of different spectroscopic tools to molecular endofullerenes has been the achievement of high reaction yields in their synthesis using the so called `` molecular surgery '' ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "komatsu and coworkers have presented the synthesis of the endohedral species h@xmath3@c@xmath4 , that is the subject of the present work @xcite .",
    "another impressive step forward in this area has been murata s group achievement , using similar experimental techniques , of the synthesis of a closed water endofullerene @xcite and the recent encapsulation of hydrogen fluoride inside c@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "significant experimental and theoretical research efforts have been devoted to the elucidation of the spectral properties of h@xmath3@c@xmath4 due to the remarkable quantum effects that link roto - vibrational and translational degrees of freedom , coming into play once the diatomic molecule is trapped into the buckyball . in the case of incarcerated h@xmath3 ,",
    "the well known existence of two allotropes of the hydrogen molecule , _ para_-h@xmath3 and _ ortho_-h@xmath3 , make this compound a valuable tool for explorations in spin chemistry @xcite",
    ". these fascinating characteristics of the supramolecular complex h@xmath3@c@xmath4 have stimulated remarkable experimental efforts with different techniques @xcite , mainly nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , infrared ( ir ) @xcite , and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , an ins spectroscopy selection rule of h@xmath3@c@xmath4 has been recently discovered @xcite .",
    "the search for an adequate description of the structure and the peculiar properties of this endohedral species has provoked intense theoretical efforts @xcite .",
    "this system represents an almost ideal testing ground for theories because it couples the simplest diatomic molecule with an almost perfect spherical cage ( the icosahedral symmetry can be neglected for most practical purposes ) .",
    "the neutral molecule retains its bound character but , at the same time , it is affected by the presence of the fullerene : its motion is confined and quantized due to the interaction with the cage , a situation that can be fully explored by powerful and simple symmetry - guided models .",
    "measurements of the ir spectrum of h@xmath3@c@xmath4 from low temperatures up to room temperatures have been performed @xcite . combining ir",
    "spectroscopy data and ins results , the lowest portion of the endohedral compound spectrum has been measured with sufficient detail to allow the experimental underpinning of the differences , shifts and splitting of the levels with respect to the free h@xmath3 counterpart .",
    "the spectrum of the confined h@xmath3 molecule has been interpreted in terms of a very accurate , though computationally involved , five dimensional phenomenological model @xcite . while these five dimensional calculations are accurate and can be used to conveniently describe the observations and to make guesses about still unobserved excited states , it is not completely obvious what is the origin of the perturbations in the potential energy terms .",
    "for example in @xcite the authors use lennard - jones potentials for each h - c pair in the complex , realizing that the use of an angular momentum quantum number associated with a harmonic motion of the molecule inside the cage is indeed appropriate .",
    "this fact supports the convenience of a computationally inexpensive symmetry - based approach like the one we suggest .",
    "we will describe our algebraic approach in sect .",
    "ii , discuss the methodology and the fits to a set of experimental lines in sect .",
    "iii , and draw conclusions in sect .  iv .",
    "stimulated by the success of the existing approach @xcite , with the aim of obtaining a simple model that encompasses the main physical ingredients for such an enticing system , we propose in the present manuscript an algebraic theory for the quantum modes of a diatomic molecule confined in an isotropic three - dimensional cage .",
    "symmetry considerations constitute the guiding principle that inspires the treatment of the energy terms obtained from a hamiltonian operator that includes molecular roto - vibrational and center - of - mass modes , and the coupling of these two subsystems .",
    "the rotations and vibrations of the diatomic molecule are described within the vibron model @xcite , that amounts to a @xmath1 lie algebra arising from the bilinear products of scalar @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and vector @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) boson operators @xcite .",
    "the fullerene cage is modeled as a spherical three dimensional well and can be dealt with a @xmath2 lie algebra , arising from a vector boson operator @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) @xcite . taking this into consideration",
    "we invoke an algebraic model based on the direct sum lie algebra @xmath11 to describe the intrinsic modes of excitations of the supramolecular complex h@xmath3@c@xmath4 , where we use the subindexes @xmath12 and @xmath13 to distinguish the two different sets of degrees of freedom .",
    "our symmetry - inspired scheme should be desirable for at least the following peculiar features : ( i ) it gives a simple framework that singles out what are the linearly independent energy terms and their connection with physical operators ; ( ii ) it gives a natural explanation for the interaction between translational and roto - vibrational degrees of freedom responsible for term energy splittings ; ( iii ) it also gives a natural explanation for the specific radial and angular dependence ( @xmath14 in the notation of refs .",
    "@xcite ) of the terms that have been found to contribute to the expansion of the coupling potential function ; ( iv ) it treats on an equal footing _ para_- and _ ortho_-h@xmath3 states ; ( v ) there is no need to find separate sets of parameters for each vibrational band , a single fit encompasses all vibrational states simultaneously ; and ( vi ) it is computationally inexpensive : the matrix elements of each operator are known in closed form and the diagonalization can be performed exactly and rapidly .",
    "in addition , it yields precise predictions for higher lying modes that , although unseen heretofore , might be investigated in future .",
    "a model that shares a similar algebraic structure , with a dynamical algebra @xmath15 , has been used in the description of hadronic structure in terms of quark building blocks @xcite . in that model",
    "the @xmath16 algebra arises from two jacobi coordinate vectors that describe quarks inside a baryon plus a scalar boson and it is used for the spatial part of the description that must be supplemented by a fermionic part containing the flavor , spin and color degrees of freedom . while the algebraic structure is very similar , clearly the physics behind the model is completely different .",
    "our model provides a complete mathematical characterization of all possible interactions that comply with the underlying symmetries and therefore naturally gives a hint of the various physical mechanisms that might generate them .",
    "we will confine the present discussion to identifying the most important terms and return to the laborious task of a complete classification in a longer paper @xcite .    among the many possible subalgebra chains , we consider the following dynamical symmetry    @xmath17    where we have used the @xmath18 limit of the vibron model @xcite and where the second line gives the quantum numbers associated with the casimir operators of each algebra",
    ". with the _ proviso _ that @xmath19 is related to the vibrational quantum number @xmath20 through @xmath21 , the set @xmath22 corresponds to the quantum numbers used so far in theoretical investigations .",
    "the basis states can therefore be labeled , very similarly to refs.@xcite , as @xmath23 .",
    "the quantum numbers follow the well - known branching rules @xcite @xmath24    the total hamiltonian can be written as @xmath25 where the first term represents the vibron model hamiltonian for rotations and vibrations of a diatomic molecule @xcite , the second is the quantized motion of the molecular center - of - mass inside the three - dimensional spherically - symmetric confining potential , and the last term includes molecule - cage couplings .",
    "the @xmath1 vibron model hamiltonian can be modeled as @xmath26 where the first term contains the two - body casimir operators of the @xmath18 dynamical symmetry and the second includes two higher - order terms in a dunham - like expansion @xcite where the first term represents a centrifugal correction and the second a rotation - vibration coupling .",

    "the guest diatomic molecule and the cage interact through a number of different physical mechanisms that can be traced back to scalar operators built out of the elements of the different algebras .",
    "even at this level , the model is quite rich , therefore one needs to select the most important operators guided by some physical principle and intuition , rather than looking for global fits that would entail too many parameters .",
    "we have found that the relevant terms imply quadrupole - quadrupole couplings .",
    "the algebraic scheme entails two sets of quadrupole operators , namely @xmath44^{(2)}$ ] , the quadrupole operators of @xmath45 , and @xmath46^{(2)}$ ] , the quadrupole operators of @xmath35 .",
    "the former describes the intrinsic ( non - null if @xmath47 ) quadrupole of the h@xmath3 molecule , while the latter can be associated with the quadrupole deformation of the probability amplitude of the whole molecule inside the spherical cage .",
    "a scalar coupling can be built from these two operators as @xmath48^{(0)}$ ] , which is the basis for the coupling term in the hamiltonian .",
    "in addition , following the spirit of a dunham expansion , further terms can be considered that lead us to select the following coupling hamiltonian :    @xmath49^{(0 ) } + \\vartheta_{pqw } \\left[\\hat c_2[so_p(4)][\\hat q_p^{(2)}\\times \\hat q_q^{(2)}]^{(0)}+[\\hat q_p^{(2)}\\times \\hat q_q^{(2)}]^{(0)}\\hat c_2[so_p(4)]\\right]+ v_{pq } \\hat c_1[u_q(3)]\\hat c_2[so_p(4)]~.\\label{hcoup}\\ ] ]    the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 can be used to adjust the interaction strengths .",
    "the most important finding about the @xmath53^{(0)}$ ] quadrupole - quadrupole interaction is that it lifts the degeneracy of @xmath54 multiplets , giving the correct and unusual ordering seen in experiments . for example , the triplet of states with @xmath55 , @xmath56 has the ordering @xmath57 that can not be due to a scalar coupling of the rotational and translational angular momentum .",
    "in fact , once j ( that is the rotational angular momentum ) and l ( the translational angular momentum ) are set , a term of the form @xmath58 always gives a splitting of the levels @xmath59 that strictly follows an increasing or decreasing ordering depending on the sign of the strength constant .",
    "following the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite or ref .",
    "@xcite , the matrix elements of the scalar coupling of the @xmath60 and @xmath61 quadrupole operators are    @xmath62^{(0)}| n_p \\omega ' j';n'_q l ' ;   \\lambda ' \\rangle = ( -1)^{l+\\lambda+j ' } \\sqrt{5 } \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc}j & l & \\lambda\\\\l'&j'&2\\\\ \\end{array}\\right\\}\\langle n_q l ||\\hat q_q||n'_q l'\\rangle\\langle\\omega j ||\\hat q_p||\\omega ' j'\\rangle\\delta_{\\lambda,\\lambda'}~~. \\label{qqelements}\\ ] ]    once we separate the molecular and cage degrees of freedom , the reduced matrix elements of the molecular ( @xmath63 ) and center - of - mass ( @xmath64 ) quadrupole degrees of freedom are @xcite    @xmath65    where we introduce the pochhammer symbol @xmath66 .",
    "the matrix elements for the other two operators in the coupling term , @xmath67[\\hat q_p^{(2)}\\times \\hat q_q^{(2)}]^{(0)}+[\\hat q_p^{(2)}\\times \\hat q_q^{(2)}]^{(0)}\\hat c_2[so_p(4)]\\right]$ ] and @xmath68\\hat c_2[so_p(4)]$ ] are trivially computed using eqs .",
    "( [ pmatel ] ) , ( [ qmatel ] ) , and ( [ qqelements ] ) .",
    "another relevant consideration with regard to the quadrupole - quadrupole coupling is the following : if one defines a total quadrupole operator as the sum of the two effects , @xmath69 and takes the ratio of the expectation values of this in the first two excited states , namely @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the resulting expression , @xmath72 depends only on @xmath73 , the label of the totally symmetric representation of @xmath45 that sets the available hilbert space for the roto - vibrational degrees of freedom , thus giving an alternative to the usual methods of assessing this parameter @xcite .",
    "we have extracted from the literature a total of 71 line positions , compiling a database that includes 55 ir transitions @xcite and 16 ins transitions @xcite . in these references ,",
    "lines have been assigned with initial and final quantum numbers on the basis of experimental evidence and theoretical models .",
    "the first step in the fitting procedure has been the assessment of the parameter @xmath73 .",
    "as experimental data for the endohedrally confined species only involve @xmath74 h@xmath3 vibrational states , there is not enough information to estimate the @xmath73 parameter for the hydrogen molecule .",
    "this parameter is usually fixed considering the ratio between first and second order parameters in the dunham expansion for the molecule under study @xcite .",
    "therefore , we devised an alternative way to assess this parameter , using the roto - vibrational spectroscopy of the free h@xmath3 molecule making use of free h@xmath3 vibrational data and explored the @xmath73 dependence of the fit to the experimental energy terms beneath @xmath75 @xmath76 with a @xmath18 dynamical symmetry hamiltonian @xmath77 + \\gamma\\ , \\hat c_2[so(3)]\\label{hamvibronfreeh2 } \\\\ &",
    "+   \\gamma_2 \\hat c_2[so(3)]^2 + \\kappa\\ , \\hat c_2[so(3)]\\hat c_2[so(4)]~.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the reason for setting an energy threshold is that the inclusion of highly - excited energy levels , close to the molecular dissociation limit , implies the necessity of including continuum effects and resonances that are out of the scope of the vibron model , based on a @xmath1 compact lie algebra @xcite .",
    "the resulting root mean square ( _ rms _ ) deviation for a fit to a total of 31 roto - vibrational experimental term energies from refs .",
    "@xcite is depicted as a function of @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ figura_rms_np ] , where it is clear that the best fit is obtained for @xmath78 and the resulting parameters can be found in tab .",
    "[ freeh2_fit ] .",
    ".parameters of hamiltonian optimized to reproduce experimental term energies of the free h@xmath3 molecule under @xmath79 with @xmath78 and @xmath80 of the fit .",
    "parameters are given in @xmath76 units .",
    "the fit to 31 experimental energy levels has an @xmath81.[freeh2_fit ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the quality and robustness of our calculations allows us to estimate the energies of levels not yet accessed experimentally .",
    "we have included in fig.[figura ] the calculated @xmath82 , and @xmath83 levels , the latter not yet measured .",
    "one can notice that , with growing @xmath20 , the higher the @xmath84 the bigger the negative energy shift of corresponding states .",
    "an extensive table with all calculated levels for @xmath85 vibrational quanta with @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be found in the supplemental material section .",
    "in addition to the term energy , expressed in @xmath76 units , we also indicate in the table the probability of the largest component ( squared coefficient ) of the corresponding eigenstate expressed in basis .",
    "in summary , we have introduced a @xmath0 algebraic scheme that combines the vibron model description of a diatomic molecule roto - vibrational structure with an algebraic description of the motion of the molecule center - of - mass inside an isotropic cage .",
    "this model is mathematically rich and has a large number of possible terms that can be attributed to different physical mechanisms .",
    "we have presented here a discussion of a few selected physical mechanisms that , in spite of the model s simplicity , give insight into the spectroscopic properties of diatomic endohedrally confined molecules .",
    "we have then applied the symmetry - guided scheme to a database of experimental lines , finding a very good overall agreement to the experimental line positions and finding that the fits improve considerably upon reassigning the quantum numbers of a small subset of energy levels .",
    "the next step is the inclusion of transition intensities in the model and the enrichment of the approach , that could take place in one of two possible venues , either by defining an embedding @xmath88 dynamical algebra or by a dynamical algebra @xmath89 with results that will be published soon @xcite .",
    "another venue for future research is the inclusion in the algebraic model of the cage icosahedral symmetry effect on the spectrum , that has recently been investigated @xcite .",
