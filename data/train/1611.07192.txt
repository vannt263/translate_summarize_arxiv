    "the majumdar - papapetrou ( mp ) solution @xcite representing an arbitrary set of stationary , extremally charged black holes in equilibrium is well known .",
    "the spacetime arises as a solution of laplace s equation .",
    "hartle and hawking @xcite assumed a flat spatial infinity and showed that any solution to laplace s equation with non point - like sources must contain a naked singularity .",
    "mp spacetimes with localized sources are unique in the sense that the only @xmath0-regular stationary and axisymmetric solutions of einstein - maxwell equations are the kerr - newman metrics and the mp metrics @xcite and they can be seen as a solution to the cauchy initial value problem @xcite . furthermore , the asymptotically flat subset of the majumdar - papapetrou class and the reissner - nordstrm exterior solution are the only asymptotically flat conformastatic electrovacuum spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the two - hole mp spacetime can also be obtained as the extreme limit of the double rn solution @xcite .",
    "recently , mp spacetimes were used to study the influence of external sources on black holes since one expects that the most powerful effect is to be expected from an additional black hole @xcite .",
    "there are , however , interesting classes of solutions of different asymptotics . in this paper , we assume a line source that extends to infinity along a straight line and we thus do not have a flat spatial infinity .",
    "although it does contain a naked singularity it is of interest in itself and , generally , non - asymptotically flat mp solutions may involve horizons .",
    "the importance of the solution consists in the fact that it has an obvious classical analog we can compare it to .",
    "we investigate the properties of the spacetime and also compare it to the charged black string @xcite , which however requires a non - zero cosmological constant .",
    "we interpret the parameter of the metric using electrogeodesics , integral definitions of mass and charge , and israel formalism for various shell sources replacing the singularities of the solution .",
    "we first derive the physical properties of the non - relativistic counterpart of the solution to be later able to compare it to the full solution . in chapter 3 , we present the studied spacetime and its basic geometrical characteristics . in chapters 4 and 5 ,",
    "we determine the mass and charge of the singular line sources using integral definitions of energy and the israel formalism , respectively .",
    "in chapter 6 , we finally investigate motion of both charged and uncharged massive particles and photons and compare them to the newtonian case .",
    "we review the classical analog of the infinite charged string .",
    "we first write the gravitational and electrostatic potentials , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in the standard cylindrical coordinates @xmath3 as follows @xmath4 with @xmath5 the mass and @xmath6 charge per unit length of the string .",
    "@xmath7 is a normalization constant defining the cylindrical surface of vanishing potential ) . ] .",
    "we now rescale the radial and azimuthal coordinates so that @xmath8 .",
    "the classical lagrangian per unit mass of a massive and charged test particle of specific charge @xmath9 then reads @xmath10 the lagrangian does not depend on @xmath11 and @xmath12 and does not explicitly depend on @xmath13 , so we have the following integrals of motion @xmath14 the only remaining equation of motion is @xmath15      if the test particle is to be in equilibrium at a given point we must have @xmath16 thus , the particle can only remain at rest if it is made of the same material as the source as regards its specific charge and in such a case it can stay still at any point .",
    "in fact , the potential part of the lagrangian then cancels out and we have a particle moving along straight lines at a constant velocity . also , free - particle motion is the only case admitting purely axial motion ( with @xmath17 ) .      for radial motion , with @xmath12 and @xmath11",

    "motion can be expressed explicitly in terms of the error function .      for circular orbits with @xmath23 and @xmath12",
    "constant , we find the following equations @xmath24\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this yields a constant angular velocity @xmath25 circular motion can occur at any radius but only for @xmath26 , which means that gravity is stronger than the electromagnetic force .",
    "the investigated general relativistic solution stems from the same laplace equation as the classical field of chapter 2 . based on this analogy",
    ", we shall refer to it as the extremally charged string or ecs , for short .",
    "however , the gravitational and electromagnetic fields are not independent here and are given by the same function .",
    "one integration constant , @xmath27 , can be scaled away by introducing dimensionless cylindrical coordinates , @xmath28 .",
    "the investigated spacetime is then described by the rescaled metric @xmath29 with @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the other integration constant the meaning of which is one of our goals .",
    "the form of the potential @xmath32 is chosen in such a way that the limit @xmath33 corresponds to the minkowski space as discussed below .",
    "the electromagnetic four - potential is @xmath34 yielding the following maxwell tensor @xmath35 describing a purely radial electric field @xmath36 , which vanishes at radial infinity .",
    "the spacetime is static and cylindrically symmetric , admitting only these three killing vectors .",
    "the kretschmann scalar reads @xmath37}{\\rho",
    "^4 \\left(k \\ln \\rho + 1\\right)^8},\\ ] ] and vanishes far away from the axis , @xmath38 , as do also all tetrad components of the riemann tensor .",
    "the spacetime thus has two singularities : one located at @xmath39 while the outer one has @xmath40 .",
    "the spacetime thus splits in two independent regions separated by the outer singularity .",
    "the spacetime is generally of type i apart from two special cylindrical surfaces where it is type d. additionally , at radial infinity , it approaches type o as all weyl scalars vanish in the limit @xmath38 .",
    "lemos and zanchin @xcite found a spacetime also describing the field of a charged and massive infinite straight string .",
    "their solution , however , requires the presence of a negative cosmological constant balancing the field .",
    "therefore , the asymptotics of the solution far away from the axis approach that of anti - de sitter .",
    "the string itself is singular but it always has a horizon making sure the cosmic censorship conjecture holds .",
    "the mass and charge densities are independent",
    ". these are all points of difference between the two solutions .",
    "if there are any closer similarities they might be revealed due to the fact that our solution can also be generalized to contain a positive cosmological constant , which will change its asymptotics and cancel the static nature of the spacetime . in our future work",
    "we will study the cosmological solution in more detail .",

    "in this section we focus on the total energy enclosed within a static cylinder of constant radius , @xmath23 .",
    "the advantage of ecs is that it is static and expressed in coordinates where the metric is diagonal .",

    "after some algebra , we conclude @xmath71 for @xmath33 , we find @xmath72 for a plot of the resulting function , refer to ( denoted @xmath73 , see below ) : the brown - york mass is positive below the outer singularity and negative above it .",

    ", komar defines the mass enclosed in a three - dimensional spacelike surface @xmath69 @xcite as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the killing vector corresponding to the time symmetry .",
    "now we plug in our choice of integration surface to yield @xmath76 we see that this expression is identical to the brown - york definition ( [ eq : lemosjakokomar ] ) .",
    "we summarize our results for various definitions of mass in . generally , they are consistent with the singularity at @xmath42 having a positive linear mass density equal to @xmath77 at least for small negative values of @xmath31 , while the outer singularity at @xmath67 has a negative linear mass density equal to @xmath77 at least for small positive values of @xmath31 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the minkowski limit can only be applied in these regions and the corresponding signs of @xmath31 , see the last paragraph of chapter 3 .",
    "if we shift the origin of coordinate @xmath23 to @xmath54 and calculate the energy within a cylinder centered at @xmath67 , we find that the total mass switches sign .",
    "we now calculate the charge within a closed area @xmath68 @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the maxwell tensor and @xmath80 denotes the hodge dual . similarly to the previous subsections on energy , if we calculate the charge enclosed by a cylindrical surface around the outer axis , the expression switches its sign .",
    "we thus conclude that the singularity at @xmath42 has a linear charge equal to @xmath77 just like the outer singularity when observed from the outside",
    ". however , when we consider the outer singularity from below , its linear charge density is @xmath81 .",
    "overall , the linear charge and mass densities of the singularities are of the same magnitude as expected .",

    "we replace the singular regions of the spacetime by flat space and study the mass and charge of matter induced on the interface between the newly introduced minkowski sections and the original ecs outside . for the sake of brevity , we just give the results here .",
    "we first replace the singularity at @xmath67 and thus take @xmath82 .",
    "we have a minkowskian cylinder of finite radius restricted by an infinitely thin cylindrical surface of induced matter , beyond which ecs stretches on to radial infinity . for @xmath52 we must have @xmath83 and for the mass and charge induced per unit length of the cylindrical interface",

    "we can not apply the limit @xmath89 here , since we could not keep the cylinder radius constant in the limiting process to stay above the outer singularity .",
    "additionally , there is also induced tension along the @xmath12-direction .",
    "let us look now at the singularity located at @xmath42 . for @xmath52",
    "we need @xmath86 and find @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",

    "the lowest - order expansion yields @xmath85 in the minkowski limit as expected .",
    "the induced cylinder has no pressure or tension in any direction .",

    "we have @xmath94 , with no pressure or tension",
    ". we can not do the minkowski limit here . for @xmath55 and @xmath83",
    "we obtain @xmath95 and @xmath90 , which is negative if we are above @xmath92 .",
    "there is again tension along the @xmath12-direction .",
    "we can not do the minkowski limit since the cylinder radius would fall below @xmath92 and we would end up with two sections of minkowski pasted together inside out with two axes present in the resulting spacetime .",
    "the cases admitting a minkowski limit are consistent with the findings of chapter  4 and @xmath96 . for an overview , see conclusions and summary .",
    "finally , we will study motion of test particles in the spacetime to compare to the results from the previous sections .",

    "the equations of motion are singular if @xmath32 or @xmath106 are singular and they diverge at @xmath39 or @xmath107 .",
    "first we will investigate static solutions .",
    "the equations reduce to @xmath108 the solution only exists between the singularities for @xmath109 and outside for @xmath110 . accepting our previous results on the charge of the singularities , we see that for @xmath52 a test particle located between the singularities with @xmath111 is repelled outward so the linear mass density of the two singularities must be positive at @xmath42 and negative at @xmath67 at least in the weak - field limit",
    ". moreover , their magnitude must be the same as this is the case for the particle .",
    "if we are outside where @xmath112 , the particle is attracted inwards by the charge so it must be repelled by a negative mass density .",
    "following the same line of reasoning for @xmath55 , we find that the signs of mass densities of the singularities are in fact the same as for @xmath52 and their magnitude is again equal to the charge density .",
    "radial cylindrical electrogeodesics are defined as world - lines where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are independent of proper time .",
    "they are governed by the equations @xmath113 where the first equation is the normalization condition and the second one comes from conservation of @xmath114 .",
    "taking @xmath115 , ( [ eq : radial1])([eq : radial2 ] ) become equations of motion for photon .",
    "we proceed by expressing @xmath116 from ( [ eq : radial2 ] ) . from normalization",
    "we then obtain an equation for @xmath23 .",
    "we thus need to solve @xmath117 from ( [ eq : radialphoton ] ) we immediately see that @xmath118 for @xmath116 to be positive . for @xmath119",
    "the photon would be static .",
    "this solution reads @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the initial radius and @xmath122 is the affine parameter .",
    "if the photon starts towards one of the singularities , it will hit it , only photons emitted above outer singularity can avoid both singularities .",
    "the geodesic can not be continued across the singularities and , therefore , we have two regions of spacetime which are causally separated .",
    "the equations for electrogeodesic can be integrated to yield @xmath123 we find two turning points @xmath124 radial acceleration at these radii reads @xmath125 we summarize our results for radial electrogeodesics in .",
    "we investigate circular electrogeodesics with @xmath23 and @xmath12 constant and governed by @xmath126 we can immediately write @xmath127 and insert this into the above equations to give @xmath128      setting @xmath115 in the previous equations , we obtain @xmath129 which yields the radius , @xmath130 , of the photon orbit @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a free parameter .",
    "we now investigate charged massive particles with @xmath105 .",
    "the equations are quadratic , so we expect two different absolute values of @xmath132 at most ( the opposite sign corresponds to the opposite direction ) .",
    "first we express @xmath132 from the normalization condition @xmath133 and substitute back into the second equation . the general solution ( for @xmath134 )",
    "is @xmath135 plots of the angular velocities for a range of specific charges are given in .    to compare these trajectories to the newtonian case",
    ", we calculate a series expansion of the angular velocity for @xmath33 @xmath136 we need to set @xmath137 in ( [ eq : klasstatic ] ) to have an extremally charged source of the field and express the angular velocity , @xmath138 , using the charge - to - mass ratio @xmath139 therefore , @xmath140 approaches the newtonian velocity if we identify the parameter of the field with the unit - length mass and charge as follows @xmath141 the regions where circular motion is possible are summarized in",
    ". there are regions admitting both @xmath142 unlike the newtonian case which only allows a single angular velocity at any given radius .",
    "this is a behavior we have already observed in a previous paper on another mp solution involving two charged black holes @xcite and is a result of the quadratic nature of the algebraic form of the equations of motion .",
    "the value @xmath143 used in the figures is @xmath144     +   +      unlike in the newtonian case , motion parallel to the axis is possible in gr .",
    "it is governed by the following equations @xmath145 null geodesics parallel to the @xmath12-axis are not possible . for charged massive particles",
    "we determine their lorentzian factor , @xmath146 , and their velocity parallel to the axis , @xmath147 .",
    "we again find two distinct solutions @xmath148 the regions admitting solutions are summarized in .",
    "we investigated the physical properties of a cylindrically symmetric majumdar - papapetrou solution of einstein - maxwell equations sourced by a non - compact , extremally charged linear singularity forming the axis of the spacetime .",
    "based on the form of the metric , we discovered that in addition to the axis singularity , the spacetime includes another singularity of different physical properties , which divides the spacetime into two causally separated regions .",
    "inside , the situation is complicated by the presence of two singularities pulling and pushing test particles in opposite directions , while outside there is only one singularity present in the spacetime .",
    "since ecs is a solution of electro - vacuum equations both singularities are the only source of the resulting gravitational and electromagnetic fields .",
    "our goal was to establish their physical parameters ",
    "mass and charge densities per unit length  and geometric characteristics . in this respect",
    ", we found that @xmath96 , see below .",
    "we calculated motion of charged test particles moving in preferred directions and compared it to the solution within the framework of classical mechanics .",
    "based on the behavior of radial electrogeodesics , we found that the singularities are not covered by horizons and are thus naked in accordance with @xcite .",
    "next , we dealt with static trajectories and gained insight into the specific charge of the singularities .",
    "we then determined circular paths and regions where such motion is possible .",
    "one interesting result is a range of circular orbit radii and conditions on the spacetime parameters allowing the existence of two electrogeodesics of the same radius but differing angular velocities in the same direction .",
    "we then determined the classical limit of the circular velocities to again obtain information about the specific charge of the singularities .",
    "when determining the mass of the sources of ecs , we also proceeded from the total energy of a region of spacetime containing the singularity .",
    "however , there is generally no way of determining locally the energy of the gravitational field in gr and we thus used several different definitions and compared them in the weak - field regime where they all agreed .    using israel formalism , we then regularized the spacetime by replacing the regions containing the singularities with flat space and continuing with ecs outside the respective cylindrical hypersurfaces , which then become the source of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields .",
    "we determined their charge and mass and compared them again for various spacetime parameters and also with the classical solution .",
    "we finally conclude that the parameter @xmath31 appearing in the metric determines both mass and charge of the singularities per unit length , @xmath149 and @xmath150 , respectively . for weak fields ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath96 as expected since the mp sources should be extremal .",
    "the inner singularity at @xmath42 has an electric charge per unit length @xmath151 and it always has a positive mass per unit length @xmath152 .",
    "the outer singularity at @xmath153 always has a negative mass per unit length , @xmath154 , as observed from both inside and outside , while its charge per unit length is @xmath155 observed from the inside and @xmath151 observed from the outside .",
    "see for the signs .",
    "it is , however , difficult to give a completely general interpretation of @xmath31 as we need to build our intuition based on comparisons with situations we understand .",
    "that is similar , for instance , to the levi - civita case where the local parameter of the metric  denoted @xmath156 or , sometimes , @xmath157determines mass per unit length of the source only for small values .",
    "using several independent methods , we thus clarified the meaning of the spacetime s structure and parameter and gained intuition about its physical interpretation .",
    "the results will broaden the knowledge of mp spacetimes with non - compact sources , which have not been paid much attention so far .",
