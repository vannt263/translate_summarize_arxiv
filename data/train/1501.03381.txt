    "the available data recoiled at rhic @xcite and lhc @xcite on heavy - ion collisions have already shown several features which indicate the formation of a high - density partonic medium .",
    "in which concerns @xmath2 collisions at lhc energies , the energy densities achieved in the high multiplicity events are similar to the ones reached in cucu central collisions or auau peripheral collisions at @xmath3 gev .",
    "it is then mandatory to look for observables which could reflect the formation of a high density medium , similar to the one already observed in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "0.25 cm one of those signals , already reported by the alice collaboration @xcite , was the rise of @xmath1 production in the highest multiplicity events obtained in @xmath2 collisions at 7 tev , that was successfully reproduced in the source interaction framework @xcite .    here",
    "we address to the production of open charm mesons .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the study of the lightest ones , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and we will comment on the other states .",
    "let us recall the essential ingredients of our model .",
    "our main assumption consists on considering high - energy hadronic collisions as driven by the exchanged of colour sources strings between the projectile and the target .",
    "those sources have finite spatial extension and thus they can interact , reducing their effective number .    0.25 cm note that one can distinguish between soft and hard sources , depending on their transverse mass , i.e. their quark composition and their transverse momentum . note also that their transverse size is determined by this transverse mass , since @xmath7 .",
    "the softness of the source maximizes its possibility of interaction , since its transverse size will be larger .",
    "0.25 cm the main consequence is that the bulk properties as the total multiplicities that are driven by the soft sources are going to be affected by their initial interactions , in particular reducing the total number of produced particles in similar way as shadowing or saturation do . on the other hand ,",
    "the hard events are less affected by source interaction and can be taken as proportional to the number of collisions .",
    "0.25 cm specifically , in our model each parton - parton collision is reflected as the number of initially produced sources @xmath8 .",
    "the hard events in @xmath2 collisions are mainly controlled by this number , i.e. the number of collisions . on the contrary ,",
    "the multiplicity distribution @xmath9 mainly soft is not proportional to the number of collisions , but mostly to the number of participants .",
    "this reduction can be considered as a consequence of shadowing in the case of @xmath10 or @xmath11 collisions @xcite , parton saturation @xcite or , as it is the case here , string interactions @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the charged particle multiplicities can suffer a reduction due to the interaction among the sources and behave roughly as @xmath12 .",
    "the above assumptions are similar to the fact that the shadowing effects decrease with the hardness of the probe . 0.25 cm in particular , in our approach",
    "the multiplicity distribution is given by = f ( ) n_s _ 1 [ eq1 ] where @xmath13 corresponds to the multiplicity of a single source in the rapidity range of interest , @xmath8 is the number of produced sources and @xmath14 corresponds to the damping factor induced by the source interaction , f()= .",
    "[ eq2 ] @xmath15 corresponds to the source density , @xmath16 , being @xmath17 the transverse size of one source and @xmath18 the transverse area of the collision .    0.25 cm in our previous paper @xcite we have assumed the proportionality between the number of produced @xmath1 and the number of collisions , = , [ eq3 ] obtaining the relation between the charged particle multiplicity and the number of produced @xmath1 , = ( ) ^1/2 ^1/2 where < > = < n_s > .",
    "[ eq4 ] the above equation leads to the following behaviour for the @xmath1 production : at low multiplicities , where the number of sources @xmath19 is small , one obtains the linear dependence = , [ eq5 ] while , at high multiplicities , = < > ( ) ^2 , [ eq6 ] where the linear dependence changes to an squared dependence when high multiplicity events are at play .",
    "this can be parametrised by the following expression @xcite : = ( 1- < > ) ( ) + < > ( ) ^2 , [ eq7 ] which agrees extremely well the available experimental data @xcite .",
    "0.25 cm let us now face the problem of open charm production .",
    "we have considered that , in first approximation , @xmath0 production is driven both by light and hard sources , due to their mixed composition .",
    "both contributions are to be taken at @xmath20 . the soft contribution will follow the linear behaviour with the multiplicity , while the hard one will behave as the @xmath1 does , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , = 0.5 ( ) + 0.5 .",
    "[ eq8 ] -0.25 cm    .relative charged - particle pseudorapidity densities , mean source densities , and relative @xmath1 and @xmath0 yields according to eqs .",
    "( 7,8 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.25 cm",
    "in order to compare with the available @xmath2 experimental data , we need to compute the dependence of the source densities with the multiplicities . in table 1",
    ", we show our values for the available experimental beams together with our results for @xmath1 and @xmath0 production according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq7],[eq8 ] ) .",
    "note that the @xmath0 meson results shown in the above table corresponds to the lightest ones , i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and are to be taken as @xmath21 integrated , i.e. @xmath22 gev .",
    "0.25 cm the experimental results on open charm production are presented for different species and different @xmath21 cuts . in order to compare with experimental data @xcite , we have taken the lowest @xmath21 beam , i.e. @xmath23 gev for @xmath4 and @xmath5 production . in fig . 1",
    ", we show our results compared to experimental alice data @xcite for @xmath0 meson production in @xmath2 collisions at 7 tev in the central rapidity range .",
    "0.35 cm        we observe a good agreement between our result and the experimental data for @xmath4 and @xmath5 production .",
    "note that , in which concerns @xmath24 production , its departure from linearity is to be more important , due to its higher mass .",
    "moreover , we can advance that the departure from linearity should also be more important for the high @xmath21 beams when compare to the low @xmath21 beams .    0.25 cm in fig .",
    "2 , our results on @xmath0 and @xmath1 are plotted and compared to experimental data .    0.35 cm        note that the @xmath1 production obeys a quadratic dependence with the multiplicity in the central rapidity region , while it is closer to linear dependence in the forward rapidity one @xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have reproduced here the rise of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production for the highest multiplicity events at central rapidity observed by the alice collaboration in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "this increase may be a consequence of the formation of a high density medium in @xmath2 collisions at lhc energies .    0.25 cm in this case , the linear dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production on the charged particle multiplicity obtained for low multiplicities where the parton densities are smaller , changes to an squared dependence when high multiplicity events are at play .    0.25 cm note that any additional @xmath1 suppression due to the possibility of string or source percolation , which could lead to a corresponding increase of the @xmath0 production , can not be at play at these energies and multiplicities , since the density of strings is well below the threshold for percolation , @xmath25 .",
