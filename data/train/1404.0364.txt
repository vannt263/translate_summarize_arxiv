    "the random environment is modeled by a probability space @xmath7 endowed with an ergodic group of measure preserving transformations @xmath8 .",

    "the main challenge is to analyze the averaged behavior of the @xmath3 s when @xmath13 changes sign . in this case , the hamiltonian corresponding to , given by @xmath14 is neither coercive nor convex and , hence , the stochastic homogenization of can not be handled by the theory developed so far in the stationary ergodic environments .    when @xmath15 is strictly positive and , for all @xmath16 , @xmath17 , the hamiltonian is convex and coercive .",

    "in this case , we consider the connected components @xmath24 of @xmath25 . in each @xmath26 ,",

    "therefore , we study the evolution of the @xmath3 s in each rescaled connected component @xmath27 and obtain , for each @xmath28 , an effective equation @xmath29 with a deterministic effective hamiltonian @xmath30 .",
    "it is , of course , necessary to assume that the sets @xmath26 are themselves stationary ergodic ( definitions are given later ) .",
    "the result is that , as @xmath31 , the @xmath3 s converge locally uniformly in @xmath32 to the solution @xmath33 of and locally in @xmath34-weak @xmath35 to @xmath36 where , for all @xmath28 , @xmath37 $ ] and @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "this result was already established in the periodic setting by cardaliaguet , lions and souganidis @xcite .",
    "we recall that , in the periodic case , each effective hamiltonian @xmath39 is found by solving the associated cell problem in the connected component @xmath40 , that is , for each @xmath41 , there is a unique constant @xmath39 such that there exists a periodic solution @xmath42 , called corrector , of @xmath43    the main difficulty in random environments is the lack of correctors .",
    "when the media is stationary ergodic , one can establish existence of subcorrectors for convex and coercive hamiltonians @xcite , that is , subsolutions of with strictly sublinear decay at infinity . to overcome the lack of correctors",

    "the difficulty is that the @xmath50 s are defined only in @xmath26 and not in @xmath6 .",
    "the lack of coercivity of creates an additional problem . since @xmath52 on each @xmath53 , the @xmath50 s are not lipschitz continuous up to the boundary of @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , as we show , the @xmath50 s blow up on @xmath53 with a logarithmic rate . in general , lipschitz estimates for solutions of hamilton - jacobi equations are given in terms of the geodesic distance within the domain ( see for example lions @xcite ) . here , using the local structure of the equation , we give sharp lipschitz bounds of the @xmath50 s , independent of the geodesic distance . as a consequence",
    ", homogenization holds for a wide class of domains , such as classical percolation structures from probability ( see for example garet and marchand @xcite , antal and pisztora @xcite ) and poisson point environments .    the tool to study the behavior of the solution to the metric problem is the subadditive ergodic theorem , which , however , can not be applied directly to the @xmath50 s , since they are not defined everywhere .",
    "to overcome this drawback , we first extend @xmath50 on each ray starting from the origin , apply the subadditive ergodic theorem to the extension and then relate back the averaged limit to @xmath50 .",
    "this difficulty is amplified by the blow up of the @xmath50 s on @xmath53 . to overcome the latter , we restrict the @xmath50 s to the sets @xmath54 we show that the averaging takes place in @xmath55 and the limit is independent of @xmath56 . moreover , in view of the lipschitz estimates , we obtain an averaging of @xmath50 , in the liminf , up to the boundary .",
    "more precisely , we show that , for each connected component of @xmath57 @xmath58 when we consider connected components corresponding to @xmath59 the liminf becomes limsup .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is then characterized by the @xmath50 s as the smallest ( respectively the largest ) constant for which the metric problem has a subsolution with strictly sublinear decay at infinity .",
    "we provide an inf - sup representation formula for each deterministic effective hamiltonian @xmath39 and establish the homogenization result in each connected component",
    ". the weak convergence then follows .",
    "few results are available for non - coercive hamiltonians and they all rely on some reduction property that compensates for the lack of coercivity ; see , for example , alvarez and bardi @xcite , barles @xcite and imbert and monneau @xcite . a different approach , based on nonresonance conditions ,",
