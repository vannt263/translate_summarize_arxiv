    "high energy ( @xmath1 100 mev ) observations of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have gained renewed interest since the launch of fermi lat @xcite . this instrument has revealed a curious diversity in the high - energy behavior of grbs and consequently represents a new challenge for models ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) . for grb 110726a @xcite , the extremely high @xmath2 peak energy ( peak of the @xmath3 spectrum ) , which was observed right after the onset of the burst , makes its interpretation in the framework of a simple internal shock synchrotron model challenging .",
    "interpreting the peak as a modified black - body from a simple photosphere is also difficult , as it can only account for energies up to few mevs , and even the subsequent time - bins show peak fluxes which , even though lower , are still unusually high .",
    "such black - body photosphere models have been considered by @xcite to explain a @xmath4 correlation found by @xcite , but as shown by @xcite , they must lie below a line in the @xmath5 plane which excludes the observed values for grb 110721a .",
    "here we show that the high peak energy and luminosity of grb110721a can be interpreted in the framework of a different class of photospheres , where dissipation occurs near the photospheric radius , and the spectrum is characterized by a synchrotron peak .",
    "dissipative synchrotron photospheres have been considered for baryonic dominated regimes by , e.g. @xcite and for magnetically dominated regimes by @xcite .",
    "here we consider such photospheres for an arbitrary acceleration law , characteristic of either a baryonic or a magnetic dominated regime . also the observed thermal bump close to @xmath6",
    "is naturally incorporated in this model .",
    "the initial acceleration behavior of the jet material is taken to be given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the saturation radius beyond which the flow reaches its asymptotic coasting value @xmath9 .",
    "based on the analysis of ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for simple conical magnetically dominated models @xmath10 , while in the simple baryonically dominated case @xmath11 .",
    "more general cases involving different magnetic geometries or flows where the opening angle varies with radius will generally lie between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the case of @xmath10 has been further developed by @xcite , including the effects of the shocked electrons at the external deceleration radius ; the generalized magnetic model including an arbitrary acceleration law @xmath14 is considered in more detail in veres et al .",
    "2012 ( in preparation ) .",
    "the models typically invoked to explain the prompt emission spectral peak fall into two broad categories .",
    "the most widely used category involves internal shocks occurring outside the scattering photosphere .",
    "the other category ascribes the peak to effects in or near the scattering photosphere , and within this category the location of the photosphere and the dissipation details depend on whether baryonic or magnetically dominated jet dynamics are assumed .    the standard internal shock picture occurring outside the photosphere @xcite uses an outflow variability timescale @xmath15 usually tenths of seconds and an average lorentz factor @xmath16 , for which the internal shocks occurring at a radius @xmath17 .",
    "with the usual magnetic field prescription one expects an observer frame peak energy of @xmath18 , an upper limit based on a variability @xmath19 s ( the light curve of grb 110721a is rather smooth , fred - like , suggesting a longer variability time ) . a somewhat different calculation including pair formation @xcite indicates an upper limit @xmath20 which is more stringent .",
    "thus , standard internal shocks do not straightforwardly explain this burst .    in the standard photosphere model using the usual @xmath11 baryonic dynamics , as pointed out by @xcite , the photospheres generally arise in the coasting regime at @xmath21 where @xmath22 constant , and in the absence of dissipation the black - body peak energy and flux representing a putative band spectrum peak would fall below a line which excludes the observations of grb 110721a .",
    "recently , more detailed photospheric models have been calculated @xcite ( see also also @xcite ) , which show a peak energy emerging from the opaque parts of jets , through comptonization of a thermal or synchrotron seed component .",
    "the numerical studies yield spectra consistent with the observed band shape . these analyses generally involve dissipation below the photosphere , and some include the effects of neutron and proton collisions as well , assuming baryonic dynamics , with the synchrotron radiation typically playing a sub - dominant or seed role .",
    "@xcite also showed that peak energies as high @xmath23 can be obtained , explaining e.g. the high @xmath24 of grb 110721a in the framework of these models .",
    "other detailed models have argued for magnetically dominated dynamics and magnetic dissipation controlling the photospheric radiation @xcite . along these lines , here we propose a simple model based on magnetically dominated dynamics , where synchrotron radiation can be expected to play a stronger role .",
    "we calculate the relation between the luminosity and the peak energy from synchrotron radiation based on a photospheric dissipation model for values of @xmath25 between the two extremes , in the context of grb 110721a .",
    "_ photospheric radius _ we consider a dissipative photosphere , where a substantial fraction of the magnetic and bulk kinetic energy is converted into random particle energy . an extra spectral component coming from the interaction of the photospheric photons with shock - accelerated electrons at the external deceleration radius is neglected here , as this produces a gev range contribution , whereas 110721a has only a tentative gev component .",
    "the photosphere arises at optical depth @xmath26 , in a jet which initially accelerates as : @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is launching radius at the base of the jet .",
    "the value of the photospheric radius can be expressed in terms of a critical lorentz factor @xcite which , generalized to an arbitrary @xmath25 , is given by @xmath29 for @xmath30 , the photosphere occurs in the accelerating phase , @xmath31 , while for @xmath32 , it is @xmath33 .",
    "the saturation radius is @xmath34 .",
    "the photosphere occurs in the acceleration phase if @xmath30 , which is typical for a magnetically dominated ( @xmath10 ) case , where @xmath35 . on the other hand ,",
    "the photosphere is in the coasting phase for @xmath32 , which is typical for baryonic cases ( @xmath11 ) , where @xmath36 .",
    "the photospheric radius can be increased by a factor of @xmath37 few by the presence of pairs @xcite .",
    "also , some of the mentioned models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) involve a wider dissipation region than the more narrow range around @xmath38 .    _ spectral peak energy _",
    "the fraction of the total luminosity dissipated and converted into radiation close to the photosphere depends on various uncertain model parameters , a rough estimate being @xmath39 ( as for example in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "calculations of the radiation from magnetic dissipation in the photosphere proceed mainly along phenomenological lines , due to the complicated nature of the process and the uncertainties .",
    "however , reconnection is expected to lead to mhd turbulence , and relativistic turbulent bulk random motions rapidly become semi - relativistic @xcite . semi - relativistic shocks with relative lorentz factor @xmath40 can be expected from such turbulent motions . this provides a simple alternative model for the radiation production , based on the fermi acceleration of electrons in these photospheric shocks , here the radiation from magnetic dissipation arises at smaller radii , and the magnetic dissipation efficiency leading to turbulence and radiation is variously estimated to be high by the authors cited above . ] .",
    "the minimum random lorentz factor of the electrons resulting from these photospheric shocks is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 @xmath43 is the fraction of the energy in electrons .",
    "the synchrotron peak energy from the electrons accelerated in such shocks is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "the physical constants have the usual meaning .",
    "@xmath46 is the fraction of the energy in magnetic form , @xmath47 is the comoving baryon density .",
    "this latter quantity scales as @xmath48 up to the saturation radius , and as @xmath49 in the coasting phase .",
    "the lorentz factor of the photosphere is @xmath50 if the photosphere occurs in the acceleration phase , and it is @xmath16 otherwise .",
    "this results in a peak energy which is in the mev range ( see  [ sec : models ] ) , which is the same range as obtained from phenomenological magnetic dissipation heating and cooling estimates by , e.g. @xcite etc .",
    "the dependence on the parameters of this peak energy is @xmath51 we provide exact values for grb 110721a for the representative cases discussed here in  [ sec : models ] .",
    "the spectral indices below and above the peak are affected by various factors .",
    "the low energy slope can be affected by synchrotron self - absorption , which in magnetic photospheres can be in the tens of kev range ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies @xcite also indicate that constraints on synchrotron low energy slopes appear in only 10% of bursts and are less stringent than in previous studies . above the peak",
    ", pairs can have an effect .",
    "pairs created by @xmath52 processes depend significantly on the photon index of the spectrum above the peak energy .",
    "the result of pair formation is a steepening break in the original spectrum .",
    "the photon index in the interval with the extreme peak energy is rather steep ( @xmath53 ) which points to an increase in the photospheric radius due to pair creation , which is not significant , consistent with our estimate of at most few . if a pair component is present , which modifies the photospheric radius by @xmath54 few , the peak energy decreases by @xmath55 which would alter the peak energy , but not in a measure to change our conclusions .",
    "a model closely related to ours ascribes the prompt emission to magnetic turbulence @xcite , which results in a natural cutoff in the spectrum at @xmath56 . in this case",
    "we would expect only minor effects from pair production .",
    "_ thermal peak _ besides the synchrotron component we expect also a ( modified ) thermal component from the photosphere .",
    "this component is observed as a thermal peak and it is advected from the launching radius , and cooled according to the generalized dynamics .",
    "we present concrete values for the temperature in section [ sec : models ] , here we only show the general dependence on the parameters : @xmath57 there were hints of a separate thermal component below the band peak @xcite in previous bursts , and there are reportedly significant thermal components also in grb 110721a @xcite .",
    "here we consider the @xmath58 pairs for different @xmath25 values to show that in the framework of a dissipative photosphere , the high peak energy of grb110721a can be obtained in a straightforward manner .    from equation [ eq : ebreak ] , @xmath30 case ( photosphere in the acceleration phase )",
    ", one sees that higher luminosities , and lower lorentz factors and launching radii , will result in larger peak energies .",
    "increasing @xmath59 and decreasing @xmath28 will increase @xmath60 eventually leading to the @xmath32 case ( photosphere in the coasting phase ) .",
    "this transition is shown by the break in the evolution of @xmath61 with luminosity ( see figures [ fig : corr ] and [ fig : corrb ] and note that in the extreme magnetic case , the peak energy does not depend on the luminosity ) .    figures [ fig : corr ] and [ fig : corrb ] show that the observed highest peak energy- luminosity pair for grb 110721a is in the admissible region of the diagrams , and for other reasonable parameters the peak energy is comfortably within the operating range of these models ( admissible regions are under the modeled broken power laws , represented by dotted , dashed and dash - dotted lines ) .    here",
    "we present cases to illustrate the peak energy dependence of the luminosity , and show that within dissipative synchrotron photospheric models we can reproduce the high peak energy .",
    "we have taken a redshift @xmath62 for this burst . in this case , in order to incorporate the high peak energy we need a slightly higher @xmath63 , which is still not unrealistic . ] @xcite for the calculations presented here .",
    "the luminosity values in the time bins are scattered around @xmath64 erg / s ( see e.g. figure [ fig : corr ] ) thus we take this as a reference value .      in this model ,",
    "the magnetic field is subdominant , the dynamics are governed by the baryons in the outflow .",
    "the critical lorentz factor is @xmath65 , which puts the photosphere in the coasting phase for moderately high @xmath66 values .",
    "the peak energy will become : @xmath67 .",
    "this is the right order of magnitude for not too extreme parameter values .",
    "lending further support for this model ( the baryonic variant ) is the temperature of the thermal component , which also turns out the right order of magnitude , @xmath68 .      in this extreme case",
    "the break energy does not depend on the luminosity , nor the coasting lorentz factor .",
    "still , for reasonable values , we can get ( see equation [ eq : ebreak ] ) a peak value @xmath69 .",
    "the temperature of the blackbody radiation is @xmath70 .",
    "the dependence on the parameters is weak and this model can not account for the observed temperature of the black - body component .      here magnetic fields",
    "are dominant , but the role of baryons is more marked than in the extreme magnetic case .",
    "the peak energy in this intermediate variant of the model is @xmath72 .",
    "again , this model can incorporate the rather large peak energy for not too exceptional parameters .",
    "the temperature of the black - body is lower than in the baryonic photosphere case , @xmath73 , but might still be consistent with the observations .    ,",
    "dotted : extreme magnetic @xmath10 , dot - dashed : moderate magnetic @xmath71 ( this work ) ) .",
    "these lines are an upper limit : values of @xmath61 and @xmath59 below them are allowed .",
    "thus , moderate magnetic and baryonic dissipative photospheres are compatible with the highest peak energy values observed , and even the extreme magnetic case is within a standard deviation .",
    "the parameters used are : for @xmath10 : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , for @xmath71 : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath77 , for @xmath11 : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath77 , and @xmath80 throughout .",
    "the solid gray line is a standard ( non - dissipative ) photosphere curve following @xcite , confirming the conclusion of @xcite that non - dissipative photospheres can not explain the highest peak energies . ]    , except for the coasting lorentz factor , which is @xmath81 here . ]",
    "we have considered the high peak energy values of the prompt spectrum of grb 110721a , which reach as high as @xmath82 mev @xcite .",
    "a consideration of the usual internal shock prompt emission spectrum model shows that such high values are unlikely in this model .",
    "furthermore , we confirm the conclusion of @xcite that a ( non - dissipative ) standard black - body baryonic photosphere model also can not explain such high peak values and fluxes .",
    "however , we show that dissipative photospheric models , with a typical peak energy due to synchrotron radiation , are able to accommodate such high peak energies and flux values , with reasonable parameters , for cases where the dynamics is either baryonically or magnetically dominated .",
    "if the temperature of the putatively observed black - body component can be used as a discriminant , this would seem to favor a more baryon dominated dissipative photosphere model , @xmath25 closer to @xmath13 , although a moderate magnetically dominated photosphere may also be possible .",
