    "since the first detection of an exoplanet orbiting around a pulsar @xcite and around a main sequence star @xcite using radial velocity measurements , several other techniques , such as microlensing , coronagraphy , and polarimetric observations have been developed for the search of other worlds .",
    "transit observations have contributed to a large fraction of the about @xmath14 confirmed planets .",
    "several systematic surveys have been implemented for the detection of exoplanet candidates by transit observations .",
    "important examples of these surveys include space - based missions such as corot @xcite and kepler @xcite satellites .",
    "the high photometric precision of their observations allowed to boost the number of candidates and confirmed extrasolar planets detected in the last five years .",
    "the next generation of space - based missions , such as the orbiting gaia @xcite and the upcoming jwst @xcite , plato @xcite , and tess @xcite are expected to increase the detection rate , and broaden the limits of the currently observed distribution of exoplanetary parameters , despite that some of these missions have not the detection of exoplanets as a main goal .    on the other hand ,",
    "ground - based photometric surveys such as superwasp @xcite and hat @xcite are focused on exoplanets with large radii and orbiting close to their host star , as these objects are particularly suited for these instruments . in order to improve the photometric precision of ground - based follow - up observations of exoplanetary transits ,",
    "a technique consisting in slightly defocusing the image has been introduced and widely used in recent works @xcite .",
    "the achieved results often compete with those of space - based surveys , and increase the opportunity for small telescopes to produce light curves with a remarkable photometric precision .",
    "following the results obtained with the defocused photometry technique , we started an observational campaign of known exoplanetary transits , already detected by the superwasp and hat surveys .",
    "photometric follow - up of these objects in different bandpasses is useful to study a possible dependence of the planetary radius as a function of the wavelength .",

[ w43-radius ] ) , which should be investigated with additional observations . in particular , we find for filter @xmath6 a value higher by @xmath13 with respect to the value reported by @xcite in the same filter .",
    "( @xmath12 against @xmath150 ) .",
    "although , as our two @xmath6 filter curves are not complete and show signatures of red noise , we suggest to carry on more observations to confirm the significancy of this result .",
    "nevertheless , we find a tendency for the @xmath151 similar to that of @xcite in the sense that the planetary radius is significantly higher at the @xmath6 band with respect to the value in other bands .",
    "the semi - major axis is slightly smaller , but comparable to the value obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the ephemerids gives a period consistent with previous results , and we confirm that there is no improvement while using a quadratic model for fitting the ephemerids .",
    "further analysis and observations would be required to ascertain if a constant period variation exists for wasp-43b .",
    "given the proximity of this planet to its host star , this is particularly relevant to explore potential mechanisms that remove orbital energy such as tidal dissipation .",
    "+ the present work is part of an ongoing survey started in 2014 . a total of 23 extrasolar planets were observed mainly with the @xmath4 and the @xmath7 telescopes giving a total of 40 good quality light curves in several filters .",
    "upgrades in the instrumentation , refinement of the observing technique , and the possibility to benefit from dark and photometric nights will increase the quality of the results in the near future , and will complement other telescope data for multi - site studies and analysis of this class of objects .",
    "moreover , three new @xmath152 telescopes will be completed by 2016 at the san pedro mrtir observatory , which are part of the taos ii project @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of this survey @xcite allow to set up specific pipelines for the early detection of new extrasolar planets , for example with a binning of the light curves as already tested for taos data @xcite .",
    "also , a project for the installation of a @xmath153 telescope at the san pedro mrtir observatory has recently reached the phase of preliminary design .",
    "current and _ in fieri _ spm - oan telescopes then represent a unique opportunity for the extrasolar planet community to complement the northern hemisphere observatories involved in this research area .",
    "multi - filter exoplanet transit observations of wasp-39band wasp-43b , carried on for the first time with all three san pedro mrtir telescopes , have shown the capability of these facilities of @xmath4 , @xmath7 and @xmath0 for this kind of investigation .",
    "the fit of the two objects shows a scatter of @xmath8@xmath9 rms in condition of full or nearly - full moon .",
    "this makes these instruments suitable for future ground - based observing campaigns , in particular for the follow - up of alerts triggered by the upcoming projects currently in development .",
    "a tendency of a higher planet radius in the @xmath6 band is obtained , consistent with the tendency reported in recent works .",
    "additional observations of this object are needed to confirm a slight dependence of this parameter on the observing filter .",
