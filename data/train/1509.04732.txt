    "the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , a strongly interacting liquid of quarks and gluons , is produced in high - energy nuclear collisions  @xcite .",
    "hard probes such as jets are frequently used to study the qgp because they are produced by hard scatterings early in the collision and propagate through the medium .",
    "hard partons interact with the medium and lose energy , a process called jet quenching .    the interactions of jets with the medium",
    "are commonly studied using three experimental methods : measurements of single - particle spectra at high @xmath0 ; di - hadron correlations where at least one particle is at high momentum , and fully reconstructed jets .",
    "observations of jet quenching at rhic was one of the key signatures of the formation of the qgp .",
    "the initial observation relied on measurements of the nuclear modification factor @xmath1 , which compares the hadron spectrum in @xmath2+@xmath2to that in @xmath3+@xmath3 . at high momentum where hadron production is expected to be dominated by jets ( @xmath0@xmath4 5 gev/@xmath5at rhic ) ,",
    "the number of hadrons observed in @xmath2+@xmath2collisions is roughly 1/5 that expected from @xmath3+@xmath3collisions  @xcite .",
    "studies of jets in a qgp are complicated by the large background due to soft processes .",
    "not only is there a large background but the strong collective flow observed in bulk particle production leads to correlations between particles in the bulk similar to the correlations due to jet production .",
    "since both jets and collective flow contribute to correlations between particles , collective flow generates a significant background for any study of jets in heavy ion collisions .",
    "collective flow is dominant at low momenta ( @xmath0@xmath6 2 gev/@xmath5 ) , so this background has typically been dealt with by focusing studies of jets on high momentum particles .",
    "however , gluon bremsstrahlung leads to gluons that are softer than the parent parton . as these hadronize , the final - state hadrons are softer on average than the final - state hadrons from the parent parton  @xcite .",
    "this means that many of these modifications are likely to be concentrated at low momentum and at large angles from the parent parton .",
    "therefore , a reliable and precise method for background subtraction is needed in order to quantify jet modification at low and intermediate momenta .",
    "we extract the background using a fit to the reaction plane dependence of background - dominated region on the near - sideof di - hadron correlations and jet - hadron correlations , called the reaction plane fit ( rpf ) method .",
    "we also compare to a fit without the reaction plane fit , the near - side fit ( nsf ) method .",
    "we demonstrate that these methods produce more accurate and reliable results than the zyam method .",
    "these methods both take advantage of differences between the signal and the background in order to determine the background .",
    "the signal on the near - sideis concentrated in a peak near the trigger hadron or jet .",
    "this peak is narrow in both azimuth and pseudorapidity .",
    "in contrast , the background forms a peak in azimuth but not pseudorapidity . for analyses in a narrow pseudorapidity range ,",
    "the background is roughly independent of pseudorapidity .",
    "we combine a background roughly matching that observed in @xmath2+@xmath2collisions with a known signal generated from pythia  @xcite to show that these methods accurately and reliably reconstruct the signal .",
    "all background subtraction methods for di - hadron correlationsand jet - hadron correlationsto date have assumed that the shape of the background is known",
    ". our methods also make this assumption .",
    "previous methods further assume that the magnitude of the coefficients of the fourier decomposition of the background are known from other studies and can be measured independent of the correlation .",
    "our methods do not make this assumption ; effects that could modify these coefficients such as contributions from jets or differences in the hydrodynamical flow in events that contain jets , are taken into account because the fourier coefficients are fit .",
    "moreover , this allows the accurate determination of the background even in cases where the fourier coefficients have not been measured to higher order , such as jet - hadron correlations . like previous methods , our methods are also dependent on the assumption that contributions from other correlations such as hanbury - brown - twiss correlations or decays of resonances that are not part of a jet are negligible .",
    "the zyam method makes the assumption that there is an angle in azimuth for which there are no correlations from jets . at sufficiently low momenta ,",
    "this is certainly not true , since the near - sideand away - sidepeaks overlap in azimuth .",
    "our methods do not assume that the signal is zero at a given angle , however , we assume instead that the signal is negligible on the near - sidewhen the difference between the pseudorapidities of the associated particle and the trigger is large .",
    "we first summarize correlation studies , discussing previous studies , correlations that contribute to the background , the shape of the background , and the shape of the signal .",
    "this is a motivation for our model of the background and the signal , discussed in the following section .",
    "we then show the results of the nsf method .",
    "while the nsf method is more accurate than the zyam method , the results are not stable when the fit range is reduced .",
    "the rpf method is tested for di - hadron correlationsin mid - peripheral collisions with a fit over a wide and a narrow range in azimuth , demonstrating that this method is more robust than the nsf method and produces more precise results than the zyam method .",
    "we then test this method for central collisions .",
    "even though the reaction plane resolution is poor in central collisions , the limited information available constrains the background and produces more precise results than the zyam method .",
    "finally , the method is tested for jet - hadron correlations .",
    "in a typical di - hadron correlationstudy  @xcite , a high-@xmath0trigger particle is identified and used to define the origin in azimuth and pseudorapidity .",
    "typically , it is defined by its high momentum alone , restricted to a range of momenta . here",
    "all trigger particles in a given momentum region are accepted and then the correlation between particles is studied in both azimuth and pseudorapidity . by selecting high-@xmath0particles the fraction of trigger particles coming from the production of jets is enhanced , however , it is not possible to determine conclusively which trigger particles originate from hard processes and which arise from soft processes , particularly for lower - momentum ( @xmath710 gev/@xmath5 ) trigger particles .",
    "associated particles are also usually defined only as particles within a given momentum interval . for each associated particle in the event ,",
    "its position relative to the trigger particle in azimuth ( @xmath8 ) and pseudorapidity ( @xmath9 ) is determined and the conditional yield is calculated . in this paper , the conditional yield is normalized by the number of events . as with the trigger particle ,",
    "it is not possible to determine conclusively which associated particles are from hard processes and which are from soft processes . for jet - hadron correlations , instead of a trigger hadron",
    ", a jet candidate is used to define the origin in azimuth and pseudorapidity  @xcite .",
    "below , `` trigger '' refers to either a trigger particle or a trigger jet .",
    "since both the associated particles and the trigger include particles created from and modified by soft processes such as hydrodynamical flow , the combinatorial background is not azimuthally isotropic in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the way that this combinatorial background is typically treated is to assume that the contribution to both the trigger and associated particles can be factorized into a contribution from hard processes , the signal ( @xmath10 ) , and a contribution from soft processes , the background ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this is referred to as the two - source model  @xcite .",
    "the term `` raw signal '' is used below for what would be measured experimentally after corrections for detector and acceptance effects but before background subtraction .",
    "the raw signal contains signal - signal ( @xmath10-@xmath10 ) correlations , signal - background ( @xmath10-@xmath11 ) correlations , background - signal ( @xmath11-@xmath10 ) correlations , and background - background ( @xmath11-@xmath11 ) correlations .",
    "it is assumed that the processes that produce the signal and the background are completely independent so that the @xmath10-@xmath11 and @xmath11-@xmath10 correlations are also background .",
    "a typical raw signal from di - hadron correlationsfor trigger momenta 8 @xmath12 10  gev/@xmath5 within pseudorapidities  0.5 and associated particles within  0.9 with momenta 1.0 @xmath13 2.0  gev/@xmath5 in @xmath3+@xmath3collisions at @xmath14  = 2.76 tev in pythia  @xcite is shown in  figure  [ fig : signal ] .",
    "the raw rsignal is normalized by the number of equivalent @xmath15collisions because this is used as the known signal later and added to the background in @xmath15collisions . because even pythia has background from an underlying event , this raw signal includes @xmath10-@xmath10 , @xmath10-@xmath11 , @xmath11-@xmath10 , and @xmath11-@xmath11 correlations . because there is no physical correlation between the signal and the background in pythia , the @xmath10-@xmath11 , @xmath11-@xmath10 , and @xmath11-@xmath11 correlations are independent of azimuth and lead to the plateau in  figure  [ fig : signal ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : signal ] shows that there is a peak near 0@xmath16which is narrow in both @xmath8and @xmath9 .",
    "there is also a peak near 180@xmath16 , which is narrow only in @xmath8 , however , this peak is roughly independent of pseudorapidity .",
    "the former is called the near - sideand comes from associated particles from the same parton as the one that generated the trigger particle .",
    "the latter is called the away - sideand comes from associated particles from the parton that scattered off of the parton that generated the trigger particle .",
    "the parton that produces the near - sideis generally thought to be biased towards partons that have not interacted strongly with the medium and it is therefore critical to study the away - sidepeak . even in pythia",
    "the away - sidepeak is roughly independent of pseudorapidity within the typical acceptance used in correlation analyses , as shown in  figure  [ fig : signal ] .",
    "while a hard parton scattering produces two back - to - back partons in the rest frame of the parton , the rest frame of the parton is , in general , not the same as the rest frame of the incoming nuclei .",
    "the difference in azimuth is negligible since most of the momenta of both the parton and the nuclei are in the direction of the beam pipe , however , the difference in pseudorapidity can be quite substantial .",
    "this causes the away - sideto be broad in @xmath9without modified fragmentation or interaction with the medium .",
    "this is evident in  figure  [ fig : signal ] .    in a heavy ion collision",
    ", these peaks may be widened through partonic interactions with the medium  @xcite , for instance if the original partons have emitted bremsstrahlung gluons .",
    "the yield in the peaks may either be higher or lower , depending on how the parton interacted with the medium and on the specific momentum range .",
    "a parton that emitted a bremsstrahlung gluon would have less energy when it fragments , meaning that the peak at high associated particle momentum would be depleted because the odds of producing a high momentum particle through fragmentation would be lower .",
    "however , at lower momentum , the peak would include particles from fragmentation of both the parent parton and the bremsstrahlung gluon , so the peak would be enhanced at low associated momenta .    for studies of the near - side , the raw signal at large",
    "@xmath9can be used to determine the level of the background without extracting the precise @xmath17  @xcite . however ,",
    "this is only useful for studies of the near - sidebecause the signal on the away - sideis also roughly independent of @xmath9and will also be subtracted when this method is applied .",
    "the background due to soft processes can be written in general by a fourier decomposition of the azimuthal anisotropy relative to the reaction plane : @xmath18,\\label{eqtn : flowfourierdecomposition}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the number of particles , @xmath20 is the angle of a particle s momentum in azimuth in detector coordinates and @xmath21is the angle of the reaction plane in detector coordinates . in high energy heavy ion collisions",
    "the fourier coefficients @xmath17arise due to hydrodynamical flow  @xcite .",
    "the initial overlap region is azimuthally anisotropic , leading to anisotropic pressure gradients , which give rise to the @xmath17 .",
    "these initial azimuthal anisotropies are preserved through partonic hydrodynamical flow and lead to azimuthal anisotropies in the final - state hadrons .",
    "the magnitude of the fourier coefficients @xmath17decreases with increasing order .",
    "the sign of the first - order coefficient @xmath22 is dependent on the incoming direction of the nuclei and changes sign when going from positive to negative pseudorapidities .",
    "since correlation analyses typically average over both positive and negative pseudorapidities , the average @xmath23 is zero .",
    "the even @xmath17are generally understood to arise mainly from anisotropies in the average overlap region of the incoming nuclei , considering the nucleons to be smoothly distributed in the nucleus with the density depending only on the radius .",
    "the @xmath17with even @xmath24 are correlated with the reaction plane .",
    "the odd @xmath17are generally understood to arise from the fluctuations in the positions of the nucleons within the nucleus .",
    "high - energy heavy ion collisions happen on a time scale short enough to be sensitive to the position of individual nucleons within the nucleus .",
    "since these fluctuations are not causally related to the reaction plane , the odd @xmath17are assumed to be uncorrelated with the reaction plane .",
    "recent measurements by atlas confirm that the correlation between @xmath24 = 2 and @xmath24 = 3 reaction planes is very weak  @xcite .    for @xmath11-@xmath11 correlations entirely due to hydrodynamical flow",
    "the conditional yield will be given by  @xcite : @xmath25,\\label{eqtn : bbcorrelations}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a constant that depends on the multiplicity of trigger and associated particles in an event and on the normalization convention , @xmath8is the difference in azimuthal angle between the associated particle and the trigger , @xmath26is the @xmath17for the trigger , and @xmath27is the @xmath17for the associated particle .",
    "@xmath11-@xmath11 correlations due to processes other than hydrodynamical flow are generally assumed to be negligible . in a typical analysis ,",
    "the pseudorapidity range for both trigger and associated particles is restricted to a region where the @xmath17do not change dramatically within the acceptance for the analysis and in this case the pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath28  is negligible .",
    "we consider only such analyses here , although analyses over a wide enough range in pseudorapidity for the @xmath17to change significantly are possible  @xcite .",

    "the signal is normalized by the number of @xmath15collisions .",
    "the signal is from figure  [ fig : signal ] and the generation of the background is discussed in the sec .",
    "iii .    in collision systems with no hydrodynamical flow where the background is due to the underlying event or soft processes uncorrelated with the reaction plane , the @xmath10-@xmath11 correlations will be independent of @xmath8and therefore only add an overall constant background .",
    "this assumption has been used for studies of di - hadron correlationsin @xmath3+@xmath3and @xmath30collisions  @xcite where this constant term is assumed to arise from the underlying event .",
    "however , jets are correlated with the reaction plane because jets are quenched more out - of - plane , where the mean path length of medium a parton must traverse is longer , than in - plane  @xcite . therefore , when there is a background due to hydrodynamical flow and a jet signal suppressed by jet quenching , the signal and the background are both correlated with the reaction plane . the @xmath10-@xmath11 and @xmath11-@xmath10 correlations will not be independent of @xmath8 in this case .",
    "since it is always possible to write any function as a fourier decomposition , equation  [ eqtn : bbcorrelations ] also describes @xmath10-@xmath11 and @xmath11-@xmath10 correlations .",
    "this leads to an overall background due to @xmath10-@xmath11 , @xmath11-@xmath10 , and @xmath11-@xmath11 correlations given by @xmath31,\\label{eqtn : jbbbcorrelations}\\ ] ] where @xmath32(@xmath33 ) is the pair weighted average of the @xmath26(@xmath27 ) due to jet quenching and the @xmath26(@xmath27 ) due to hydrodynamical flow .",
    "generally the @xmath17used in background subtraction are measured separately from the correlation measurements . the appropriate method for measuring the @xmath17is not obvious .",
    "different methods for measuring flow produce systematically different results in the same event class . measurements of @xmath17using the event plane lead to systematically higher results than measurements using correlations between multiple particles , such as a four - particle cumulant method  @xcite .",
    "the latter is less sensitive to non - flow , making it less sensitive to contamination from jets . in principle",
    "this would make it a better measurement for the @xmath27 in equation  [ eqtn : bbcorrelations ] and equation  [ eqtn : jbbbcorrelations ] , however , these methods are also less sensitive to event - by - event fluctuations in flow and to local hot or cold spots in the medium . additionally , it is possible that events containing jets could have slightly different average @xmath17due to hydrodynamical flow than measurements of @xmath17 in minimum bias collisions . for these reasons it is desirable to have a method where the @xmath32and @xmath33used for the background",
    "are determined from the same analysis as the measurement of the @xmath10-@xmath10 correlations .",
    "furthermore the determination of the appropriate @xmath11 in equation  [ eqtn : jbbbcorrelations ] is difficult and prone to assumptions about the signal which may not be true .",
    "the most common method used is to assume a zero yield at minimum ( zyam )  @xcite , or some variation of zyam , for instance to assume zero yield at @xmath8= 1 .",
    "this assumes that there is a region in @xmath8where the signal goes to zero .",
    "the problem with this assumption is that there may be no region in azimuth where the j - j correlations go to zero . even in pythia , at low momentum ( @xmath34@xmath7 1 gev/@xmath5 ) there is no flat region in @xmath8 , indicating that there is no reliable @xmath8region where the signal can be assumed to be zero . in heavy ion collisions , where both the near - side  @xcite and the away - side  @xcite peak may be modified by interactions with the medium",
    ", it is even less reliable .",
    "the abs method  @xcite uses mixed events to determine the background level .",
    "this is an improvement on zyam , however , it makes the assumption that the number of @xmath10-@xmath11 and @xmath11-@xmath10 pairs are negligible compared to the number of @xmath11-@xmath11 pairs .",
    "this assumption is valid for central collisions where the multiplicity of background particles is large , but not valid for peripheral collisions or collisions in small systems .    the data at small @xmath8and large @xmath9are observed to be dominated by the background  @xcite , whatever its source , and can be fit to equation  [ eqtn : jbbbcorrelations ] to determine the @xmath35 .",
    "the background determined in this manner still assumes that the form of the background in equation  [ eqtn : jbbbcorrelations ] is correct and it is sensitive to the validity of the assumption that there is no residual signal in the large @xmath9and small @xmath8region used for these fits .",
    "however , it improves on zyam because there is no assumption that the signal goes to zero at one point and improves on both zyam and the abs method because there is no assumption that the @xmath35 in the background in correlation studies are equal to the @xmath36 measured from studies of hydrodynamical flow .",

    "the yield is given by @xmath66 where a = -1.05 and b = 1.05 for the near - sideand a = 2.09 and b = 4.19 for the away - side .",
    "the yields are not comparable between 010% and 3040% central data because of the normalization by the number of events",
    ".      the raw signal in the region 1.0 @xmath64@xmath9@xmath65 1.4 is fit to equation  [ eqtn : jbbbcorrelations ] to order n = 3 from  @xmath63/2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fitalonesignalplusbackground ] shows the true background , the signal plus background , and the background from this fit for di - hadron correlationsin 3040% @xmath15collisions at @xmath29  = 2.76 tev .",
    "figure  [ fig : fitalonesignalplusbackground ] also shows the background extracted in this region using the modified zya1 method .",
    "the signal extracted using the nsf background , the modified zya1 background , and the standard zya1 background are compared in figure  [ fig : fitalonesignalextracted ] to the true signal . only statistical uncertainties on the background are shown .",
    "figure  [ fig : fitalonesignalplusbackground ] and figure  [ fig : fitalonesignalextracted ] show that the nsf , zya1 , and modified zya1 methods describe the background well in this model and that they have comparable uncertainties .",
    "the nominal value of the signal extracted using the fit is not centered on the true value like the nominal values for the zya1 and modified zya1 methods , however , as discussed above , our implementation of these methods may slightly underestimate the true uncertainties on the @xmath17and therefore underestimate the shape distortions from the zya1 method .",
    "additionally , in a heavy ion collision , the away - sidecould be modified significantly and become much broader . in this scenario",
    ", the nsf method would be less sensitive to residual signal in the away - sidethan the zya1 method .",

    "the nsf method describes the background better for 010% central collisions than for 3040% central collisions . in central collisions",
    "the @xmath67are smaller and the background is larger so it is possible to determine the background with higher precision .",
    "the yields are extracted for all these cases using equation  [ eq : yields ] and are summarized in the table  [ tab : yieldsnorxnplane ] .",
    "the nsf method provides a more precise measurement of the yield than zya1 in all cases .",
    "however , we noticed that the fit was sensitive to the fit range .",
    "figure  [ fitalonebackgroundnarrowdphi ] shows the true background , the signal+background , the background using the zya1 method , and the background extracted using the nsf method in the range  1.25 .",
    "this fit clearly fails to describe the @xmath17background , even though the fit converged and the fit quality is comparable to the fit in the range  @xmath63/2 .",
    "this is because the fit needs to be able to distinguish between @xmath39 and @xmath40 . at @xmath8= @xmath63/3 ,",
    "the @xmath40 term starts increasing while the @xmath39 term is still decreasing . either the fit needs to cover enough range in @xmath8to distinguish between these two terms or the data need to have enough statistics that it is possible to discern the relative weights of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 terms from the width of the near - sidepeak .",
    "the fit in figure  [ fitalonebackgroundnarrowdphi ] shows that realistic statistics do not provide data with the precision required for the latter .",
    "if a fit to the near - sideat large @xmath9were used for analyzing data , it could lead to subtracting the wrong background and potentially extracting a signal with a distorted signal on the away - side .",
    "we therefore explore using the reaction plane dependence of the raw signal , which uses more information and therefore is likely to have lower uncertainties and be more stable .      when a trigger hadron or parton is restricted relative to the reaction plane , the level of the background and the effective @xmath26are affected . the derivation of the appropriate reaction plane dependent forms are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . when the trigger is restricted to a range of angles relative to the reconstructed reaction plane , the effective even @xmath26are given by    @xmath68    and the effective background level",

    "the background is then given by :    @xmath72    since the reaction planes for odd @xmath24 are uncorrelated with the n = 2 reaction plane , all odd @xmath24 terms have @xmath73= @xmath67when the n = 2 reaction plane is used for an analysis . here",
    "we consider simultaneous measurements of @xmath74with the trigger restricted to four different regions :    * all ; * in - plane : @xmath70 = 0 , c=@xmath75 ; * mid - plane : @xmath70 = @xmath76 and @xmath70 = @xmath77 , c=@xmath78 ; * out - of - plane : @xmath70 = @xmath79 , c=@xmath75 .    note that the mid - planerange is actually split into four symmetric regions .",
    "these regions are shown schematically in figure  [ fig : rxnplanefig ] .",
    "the information on the reaction plane dependence of the raw correlations can reduce the uncertainty on the background .",
    "this can be understood by considering what additional information the reaction plane dependence provides .",
    "the level of the in - planecorrelation is increased by @xmath80 and the @xmath81 term is increased , as shown in equation  [ eq : vneff ] and equation  [ eq : beff ] .",
    "this allows @xmath80 to be determined with high precision from these correlations .",
    "in contrast , the background level of the mid - planecorrelation is insensitive to @xmath80 and the modulation of the correlation by @xmath81 is approximately equal to @xmath80 . since the in - planeand out - of - planecorrelations",
    "strongly constrain @xmath80 , the mid - planecorrelation can be used to constrain the higher - order @xmath17 .",
    "the normalization of the correlations per event allows the constant @xmath82 to be the same for all reaction plane orientations .",
    "figure  [ fig : piecewisefitbackgroundextractionhhmidperipheral ] shows the signal+background in the region 1.0 @xmath64@xmath9@xmath65 1.4 for di - hadron correlationsin 3040% @xmath15collisions at @xmath29  = 2.76 tev for in - plane , mid - plane , out - of - plane , and all reaction plane angles .",
    "we fit the signal on the near - sideto all reaction plane orientations simultaneously , restricting the fits for each reaction plane orientation to  @xmath63/2 . the @xmath50are fixed at the values in our model . in an experimental analysis , the @xmath50can be measured .",
    "we varied the order of @xmath17used in the fit until we used the fewest parameters necessary to get a reliable fit .",
    "we found that the fit worked best to n = 4 , corresponding to a total of six parameters , @xmath11 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "the extracted parameters were all within error of the parameters used in the simulation .",
    "the rpf method is compared to the modified zya1 method .",
    "note that for the zya1 method a different @xmath67 must be used for each reaction plane orientation .",
    "again we use the nominal values of @xmath17thrown using our model and assume 5% uncertainties on the @xmath26 .",
    "only statistical uncertainties are shown for each background method .",
    "figure  [ fig : piecewisefittruevsrecosignalhhmidperipheral ] compares the signal extracted using the various background methods to the true background .",
    "the yields are given in table  [ tab : yields ] .",
    "the rpf method leads to a much more accurate determination of the signal shape and the yield than the zya1 or modified zya1 methods for correlations with a trigger in - planeand out - of - plane .",
    "this is because even with the optimistic 5% uncertainty on the @xmath17 , the amplification of the @xmath89 for these correlations makes the accurate determination of the background difficult .",
    "one of the benefits of the simultaneous fit of the background to the different reaction plane orientations on the near - sideis that it may allow a fit over a narrower @xmath8range , which would reduce the impact of any signal from the away - sidefrom a modified away - side .",
    "we therefore fit the signal over  1 , which should be less sensitive to residual signal than a fit to  @xmath63/2 .",
    "this is a narrower range than that shown in figure  [ fitalonebackgroundnarrowdphi ] because by varying the fit range we found that the simultaneous fit converged even when a narrower range in @xmath8was used .",
    "the background extracted with this fit is compared in figure  [ fig : piecewisefitbackgroundextractionhhmidperipheralnarrowdphi ] to the true background and the background extracted using the modified zya1 method .",
    "the signal extracted using this fit is shown in figure  [ fig : piecewisefittruevsrecosignalhhmidperipheralnarrowdphi ] and the yields are given in table  [ tab : yields ] . while the signal using the fit over  @xmath63/2 shown in figure  [ fig : piecewisefittruevsrecosignalhhmidperipheral ] has slightly smaller uncertainties , the signal using the fit over  1 shown in figure  [ fig : piecewisefittruevsrecosignalhhmidperipheralnarrowdphi ] is comparable . since the width of the away - sidepeak varies with both @xmath90and @xmath34and even the near - sidewidth is observed to be modified in heavy ion collisions  @xcite , a narrower fit range is better . with a range covering  1 , even an away - sidepeak with a width of @xmath8= 1",
    "would have less than 5% of its amplitude in the fit region .",
    "central collisions are often considered the most interesting because the medium reaches higher energy densities and hottest temperatures .",
    "naively one might assume that this method can not be applied to central collisions because the reaction plane is not known to better than approximately 40@xmath16 and the reaction plane bins described above are 30@xmath16 wide .",
    "equation  [ eq : vneff ] and equation  [ eq : beff ] show that the @xmath91and @xmath73differ less between in - plane , mid - plane , and out - of - planewhen the @xmath50are small than when the @xmath50are large .",
    "this is because a large fraction of the trigger particles reconstructed in - planewill actually come from mid - planeand some will even come from out - of - plane . still , there is a difference between the correlations for trigger particles reconstructed with different reaction plane angles and this provides some information .",
    "the background determined using the zya1 method , modified zya1 method , and rpf method over the range  @xmath63/2 are compared to the signal+background and the true background in our model for di - hadron correlationsin 010% @xmath15collisions at @xmath29  = 2.76 tev for in - plane , mid - plane , out - of - plane , and all reaction plane anglesin figure  [ fig : piecewisefitbackgroundextractionhhcentral ] .",
    "the fit used in the rpf method is to order @xmath24 = 3 because the fit to order @xmath24 = 4 was not stable .",

    "this method would be particularly useful for jet - hadron correlationsbecause only @xmath39 has been measured for jets and therefore background subtraction requires either large estimates of the uncertainty due to the @xmath17  @xcite or limiting the analysis to the near - sidewhere the background can be determines from the @xmath9dependence of the signal  @xcite .",
    "we have presented two methods for determining the combinatorial background in di - hadron correlationsand jet - hadron correlationsby fitting the raw correlation at large @xmath9where the correlation is background - dominated .",
    "we have demonstrated that these methods accurately and reliably subtract the background using a model where the background is entirely due to flow and the signal is generated using pythia .",
    "these methods produces better results than the zya1 method .",

    "the reaction plane fit method makes the same assumptions about the shape of the background made in other methods , namely that it has the functional form given by equation  [ eqtn : jbbbcorrelations ] .",

    "the primary assumptions of this method are that the background has the functional form given by equation  [ eqtn : jbbbcorrelations ] , that the background s @xmath9dependence is negligible , and that the contribution of the signal to the correlation at large @xmath9and small @xmath8is negligible .",
    "this latter assumption is not valid at lower momenta and we were unable to extend the analysis to @xmath34@xmath7 1 gev/@xmath5because in this region the near - sidepeak is too broad even in pythia and distorts the fit .",
