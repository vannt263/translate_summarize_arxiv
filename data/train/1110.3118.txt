    "in other words , the disorder induced nontrivial nature soon hides in the lower kps deeply below the tai region .",
    "we will argue that , those narrow and topologically trivial kps are responsible for nonzero dos in this region , while these nontrivial subgaps are responsible for the tai region observed from transport calculations in ref . @xcite .     and @xmath136 as a function of supercell size @xmath62 .",

    "indeed , the numerical results confirm that ( not shown here ) , compared to the width of tai region , the statistical error of @xmath113 is extremely small .",
    "on the other hand , the origin of tai phase exhibited from transport calculations is more profound .",
    "it is well known that a nontrivial subgap always gives rise to dissipationless edge states .",
    "however , in our case , these disorder induced nontrivial subgaps are densely and randomly distributed on the energy axis . to confirm that they are indeed responsible for tai phase",

    ", we define a function @xmath140for a definite supercell size and a definite disorder configuration .",
    "the average @xmath141 over the disorder ensemble is the probability for the fermi energy @xmath131 to fall into a nontrivial subgap .",
    "if the above physical picture can make sense , @xmath142 must be a value very close to 1 in the tai region , under random averaging and size scaling . in fig .",
    "[ figd ] , we show the numerical results of @xmath141 over averaging and scaling . the conductance curve is also plotted as a comparison .",

    "note this broad peak of @xmath141 calculated with supercell size @xmath143 is sufficient to reproduce tai region identified from conductance plateau for @xmath121 samples .",
    "in the process of scaling ( @xmath144 ) , the numbers of subpairs and subgaps increase , while the widths of individual subpairs and subgaps decrease but with different decreasing rate . as a result , as disclosed in fig .",
    "[ figd ] , for large enough @xmath62 , the total measure of subgaps will dominate over that of flat subpairs , @xmath145 .",
    "[ figd ] is the most important result of this paper .",
    "it reveals that , the tai phase corresponds to a cluster of nontrivial subgaps instead of a single topologically nontrivial gap .",
    "a fermi energy falls into a nontrivial subgap with a probability close to 1 .",
    "the kps , although contributing to nonzero dos in this region , are so narrow that their measures on the energy axis are extremely small , and they are localized therefore do not contribute to the electronic transport . because of the topological origin , it is now clear why the tai is an qshe phase seen from the real space@xcite , and why the dissipationless currents are still carried by edge states@xcite .",
    "in summary , the topological evolution of tai is studied in a supercell regime . starting from a trivial insulator phase with a small gap , weak disorder inevitably lead to gap closing between the valence and conduction bands , which is a second order perturbation effect .",
    "this causes an exchange of topological invariants between them , and results in a transition to a topologically nontrivial phase . in the limit of large supercell",
    ", there will be very large numbers of subbands and subgaps densely distributed on the energy axis .",
    "however , there exists a continuous region where the fermi energy falls into a nontrivial subgap with an extremely high probability , even after a statistical average over the disorder ensemble .",
    "this special region can thus support a stable and observable tai phase .",
