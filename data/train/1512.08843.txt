    "a quantum state of matter , which has a bulk energy band gap separating the valence band maximum ( vbm ) and the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) like an insulator in its interior but behaves like a metal on its boundary , is classified as topological insulator ( ti ) .",
    "the gapless states of a ti on its boundary ( surface ) are protected by time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry .",
    "the surface states of a ti give rise to conducting states , which are predicted to have special properties useful for spintronics and quantum computations .",
    "the topological insulating property of a material is closely associated with integer quantum hall effect ( qhe ) .",
    "qhe arises in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas , in the presence of an external magnetic field , where the energy spectrum of electron splits into landau levels .",
    "haldane , in his novel work , showed that qhe may also arise even in the absence of a net magnetic flux within a unitcell when the tr symmetry is broken in a periodic 2d system@xcite .",
    "it was shown that , the ground state of a periodic 2d electron system having a gap in the single particle density of states at fermi level possesses quantized transverse conductivity ( @xmath4 ) @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is generally rational but can be integer in the absence of electron - electron interactions@xcite .    in haldane s model , the spin degrees of freedom of the electrons was not considered and letter on it was generalized to an electron system having spins . in this model",
    "the electronic states become doubly degenerate when there is no coupling between up - spin and down - spin states .",
    "the electrons in the conducting edge channel are chiral , i.e. , flowing counter clockwise when @xmath7 and clockwise when @xmath8 which is the characteristic of the topology of bulk quantum hall state . kane and mele generalized the haldane model including electron spin degrees of freedom for a graphene lattice@xcite .",
    "they introduced spin - orbit interactions between electron spin and momentum and showed that graphene converts from a 2d semi - metallic state to a quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulator . here , unlike the qhe where the tr symmetry is broken by periodic magnetic filed",
    ", the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) preserves tr symmetry .",
    "the edge states are nonchiral in the case of qsh insulator and the up - spin electrons in the edge channel flow in one direction while the down spin - electrons flow in the opposite direction@xcite . as a result ,",
    "the hall conductivity becomes zero but there is a quantized spin hall conductivity ( @xmath9 ) , defined by @xmath10 with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are up - spin and down - spin currents respectively along @xmath14 direction and @xmath15 is the electric filed along @xmath16 direction . kane and mele also showed that under the tr symmetry the edge states in the qsh insulator is robust against the violation of spin conservation because of their crossing at brillouin zone boundary leads to kramers doublet which remains invariant for any tr symmetric perturbation .",
    "this proves that the qsh insulator is a topological phase of matter .",
    "graphene is made of carbon atoms which is a light element and said to have a weak soc strength . in the search of strong soc strengths made from heavy elements",
    "bernevig @xmath17 @xmath18@xcite proposed a quantum well model of hgte / cdte .",
    "they showed that the transition from a conventional insulating phase to a topological quantum phase occurs for a critical well thickness ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "their proposal leads to the experimental detection of qsh insulator phase .",
    "they considered a quantum well structure where hgte was sandwiched between layers of cdte and with the @xmath20 theory they established that band inversion takes place at the @xmath21 point in the brillouin zone above a particular thickness ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this band inversion leads to a quantum phase transition from a trivial insulator to a qsh insulator . soon after the theoretical prediction of qsh in hgte / cdte quantum well , knig @xmath17 @xmath18@xcite grew thin hgte quantum well sandwiched between ( hg , cd)te barriers using molecular beam epitaxy to observe the phenomena of qsh effect experimentally .",
    "they observed a normal electronic structure having zero conductivity for samples with narrow quantum well whereas an inverted electronic structure with a conductivity close to the conductivity of a qsh insulator was found above a critical well thickness(@xmath19 ) .",
    "we discussed earlier that the topological surface stares are protected by tr symmetry .",
    "the dirac nodes on topological surface states are robust in the presence of non - magnetic disorder because this perturbation can not break the tr symmetry .",
    "but , the tr symmetry can be broken by introducing a magnetic impurity , what is known as quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) effect .",
    "qah effect and the associated disorder , which may lift the degeneracy at the dirac points , opens up a band gap in the surface states .",
    "this effect was theoretically predicted in mn doped hgte quantum well where the quantized hall conductivity was obtained for a range of well thickness and the doping concentration@xcite .",
    "another theoretical work based on first - principle calculations predicted that thin films of tetradymite semiconductors ( e.g. bi@xmath2te@xmath0 , bi@xmath2se@xmath0 , sb@xmath2te@xmath0 ) doped with transition metal elements ( cr or fe ) would be possible candidates to show qah state@xcite .",
    "an experimental observation of qah in magnetic ti was reported by chang @xmath17 @xmath18 in the case of cr doped ( bisb)@xmath2te@xmath0 thin films@xcite . in another observation of qah",
    ", it was shown that fe on the surface of bi@xmath2o@xmath0 opens up a gap at the dirac point , whose value is likely to be set by the interaction of fe ions with the se surface , due to the disorder induced tr symmetry breaking on the surface@xcite .    in the search of ti materials , transition metal oxides ( tmos ) were also predicted to be possible candidates with a non - trivial band topology .",
    "tmos show a variety of interesting properties depending on their electron - electron correlations such as magnetism , ferroelectricity , superconductivity , mott insulators etc . based on first - principle and tight - binding ( tb ) calculations",
    ", it was proposed that bilayers of perovskite tmos grown along [ 111 ] direction are potential candidates for 2d tis@xcite .",
    "the topological band structures and the associated qsh phase of these materials were predicted to be depended on substrates , dopant ions and external gate voltages@xcite .",
    "recent theoretical works suggested that anti - perovskite tmos ( a@xmath0bo ) may also become promising candidates for new tis via their interplay between band topology , crystal symmetry and electron - electron correlations@xcite .",
    "ti phase associated with qah state could also be realized in double - perovskite ( la@xmath2mniro@xmath23 ) monolayers grown along [ 001 ] direction as theoretically suggested by zhang @xmath17 @xmath18 via their first - principle and tb calculations@xcite . in our theoretical work based on first - principle calculations we do a search for ti phase associated with a magnetic ground state among perovskite tmo bilayers [ 111 ] . here ,",
