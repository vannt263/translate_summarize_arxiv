    "collisional cascades play a central role in planet formation . in current theory ,",
    "planets grow from collisions and mergers of km - sized planetesimals in a gaseous disk .",
    "as planets grow , they stir leftover planetesimals along their orbits to high velocities .",
    "eventually , collisions among planetesimals produce smaller fragments instead of larger , merged objects . continued stirring leads to a cascade of destructive collisions which grinds the leftovers to dust .",
    "this process ( i ) explains the masses of terrestrial planets @xcite and kuiper belt objects @xcite and ( ii ) produces debris disks similar to those observed around nearby main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of icy planet formation suggest the cascade limits the masses of growing protoplanets to @xmath1 0.01  .",
    "this mass is much smaller than the core mass , @xmath0 0.11 , required for a protoplanet to accrete gas and become a gas giant planet @xcite . unless icy protoplanets can accrete collision fragments before the fragments are ground to dust",
    ", these protoplanets can not grow into gas giant planet cores .",
    "thus , finding a mechanism to halt the cascade is essential to form gas giant planets .    here , we describe how interactions between the fragments and the gaseous disk can halt the cascade . in our picture , the gas traps small fragments with sizes of 0.1  mm to 1  m and prevents them from colliding at large velocities .",
    "these fragments then settle rapidly to the disk midplane , where protoplanets can accrete them . for a broad range of initial conditions , analytic results and detailed numerical simulations",
    "demonstrate that this process yields 110  cores in 12  myr .",
    "we develop the analytic theory in  2 and derive the conditions needed for protoplanets to accrete collision fragments and grow to masses of @xmath1 1  in 12  myr .",
    "we confirm these estimates in  3 with detailed numerical calculations .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion in  4 .",
    "the crucial element of our model is the interaction of collision fragments with the gaseous disk .",
    "fragments larger than the ` stopping radius ' @xmath2 0.52  m at 510 au @xcite , orbit with the growing protoplanets , independently of the gas .",
    "destructive collisions among these fragments fuel the collisional cascade . however , the gas entrains particles with radii @xmath3 .",
    "these fragments orbit with the gas ; thus , their velocity dispersions are small and independent of massive protoplanets . by trapping small collision fragments , the gas halts the collisional cascade",
    ".    the gas also allows protoplanets to accrete the debris . when the collisional cascade begins , the mass in leftover planetesimals is @xmath1 110  .",
    "the cascade grinds all of this mass into small fragments which are trapped by the gas .",
    "most of the trapped fragments fall through the gas into the midplane of the disk , where growing protoplanets accrete them .",

    "thus , our model yields gas giant cores if ( i ) the collisional cascade produces fragments fast enough , ( ii ) the fragments quickly settle to the midplane , and ( iii ) the largest protoplanets rapidly accrete the fragments .    to examine whether this physical model leads to cores with masses of @xmath1 1 , we consider the growth of planets in a disk of gas and icy objects around a star with mass .",
