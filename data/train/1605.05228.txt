    "mixtures of water and organic solutes are of fundamental importance for understanding biological and chemical processes as well as transport properties of fluids .",
    "even though the simplicity , of these solutions some of them show a complex behavior of their thermodynamic and structural properties  @xcite .",
    "for example , close to the ambient conditions , around @xmath0 , @xmath1 , the excess volume in binary mixtures of water and alcohols  @xcite and of water and alkanolamines  @xcite is negative and it exhibits a minimum as the fraction of the solute is increased . in the case of water - ionic liquids , however , the excess volume depend on the hydrophobicity of the solute .",
    "simulation results suggest that for hydrophilic solutes as the 1,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride the excess volume has a minimum as in the case of the alcohols , whereas for the case of more hydrophobic liquids as the 1,3-dimethylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate the excess volume is positive  @xcite .",
    "the excess enthalpy of the aqueous organic mixtures also show a distinct behavior . while the mixtures of water with small alcohol molecules as methanol  @xcite and ethanol  @xcite exhibit a negative excess enthalpy , the mixtures of water with large alcohol molecules as propanol and butanol isomers show a positive excess enthalpy  @xcite . similarly to the small alcohol - water mixtures the excess enthalpy for the water - alkanolamine solutions also show a minimum  @xcite . in the case of ionic liquids",
    "the excess enthalpy also show two types of behavior . for the less hydrophobic ionic liquids in which the excess volume is negative ,",
    "the excess enthalpy is negative and shows a minimum at the same solute fraction of the minimum of the excess volume . for the hydrophobic ionic liquids the excess enthalpy is positive and shows a maximum for the same fraction of the solute of the maximum of the excess volume  @xcite .",
    "the excess isobaric specific heat for the methanol at ambient conditions increases with the fraction of the solute and exhibits a maximum value around the solute concentration @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the excess free energy presents a harmonic dependence on the methanol fraction  @xcite and the excess entropy of mixing , differently from the ideal mixtures  @xcite , assumes negative values and decrease its value as the increasing methanol concentrations  @xcite . in the case of the ionic liquids",
    "the constant pressure heat capacity also shows an oscillatory behavior but the peak occurs at higher concentrations of the solute @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the description of this complex behavior of the organic solutes in water in can be made , in principle , in the framework of the frank and evans  @xcite iceberg theory .",
    "these authors proposed that water is able to form microscopic icebergs around solute molecules depending on their size and the water - solute interactions .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite using neutron diffraction support frank and evans  @xcite scenario for the methanol .",
    "the diffraction of a concentrated alcohol - water mixture ( @xmath4 ) suggests that at these conditions most of the water molecules ( @xmath5 ) are organized in water clusters bridging methanol hydroxyl groups through hydrogen bonds . in the same direction",
    "an experimental result from x - ray emission spectroscopy for an equimolar mixture of methanol and water carried out by guo _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite suggests that in the mixture the hydrogen bonding network of the pure components would persist to a large extent , with some water molecules acting as bridges between methanol chains .",
    "consistent with these results , recent experimental work for the methanol  @xcite suggests that the negative excess the entropy of mixing arises due to a relatively small degree of the interconnection between the hydrogen bonding networks of the different components rather than from a water restructuring  @xcite .    motivated by these experimental results and by the huge number of applications , water - methanol mixtures have been intensively studied by computer simulations . in these simulations ,",
    "water molecules are represented by one of well known classical models spc@xmath6e  @xcite , st4  @xcite , tip5p  @xcite and methanol molecules are frequently modeled by opls force field  @xcite . using molecular dynamics simulation , bako  _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite found that on increasing the methanol fraction in the mixture , water essentially maintains its tetrahedral structure , whereas the number of hydrogen - bonds is substantially reduced .",
    "allison  _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite showed that not only the number hydrogen - bonds decreases , but the water molecules become eventually distributed in rings and clusters in accordance with the experimental results  @xcite . analyzing the spatial distribution function of the water , laaksonen  _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite observed that the system is highly structured around the hydroxyl groups and that the methanol molecules are solvated by water molecules , in accordance with well known iceberg theory  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the atomistic approaches , water - methanol mixture has been modeled by continuous potentials in which the water is represented by a spherical symmetric two length scale potential while the methanol is represented by a dimer in which the methyl group is characterized by a hard sphere and the hydroxyl is a water - like group  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations for this system displays good qualitative agreement with the response functions for different temperatures  @xcite but fails to produce the heat capacity behavior and does not provide the structural network observed in experiments and predicted by the iceberg theory .    due to the variety and complexity of the ionic liquids , very few theoretical studies have been made for analyzing the ionic liquids aqueous solutions .",
    "for example , there is no clear picture explaining why the excess volume of some ionic liquids is negative while for others is positive .",
    "in addition , it is not clear why for large alcohols the excess enthalpy is positive while for the methanol is negative . the explanation for these different behaviors both in the alcohols and in the ionic liquids might rely in the disruption of the iceberg theory as the solute is large of hydrophobic . in order to test this idea ,",
    "here we explore how the excess properties of the water - solute mixture is affected by the change of the water - solute interaction from attractive to repulsive . in order to allow for the water to form a structure not present in the continuous effective potentials , our model exhibits a tetrahedral structure .    in this work the water and the solute",
    "are modeled following the associating lattice gas model ( alg )  @xcite scheme .",
    "the two molecules are specified by adapting the hydrogen bond and the attractive interactions for each molecule .",
    "the excess volume and enthalpy are computed for various types of water - solute interactions .",
    "the remaining of the paper goes as follows . in the section  [ sec : model ]",
    "the models for water , solute and mixture are outlined and the ground state behavior is presented .",
    "the technical details about the calculations of ground state are presented in the appendix  [ ap : entropy ] . in the section  [ sec : methods ]",
    "the computational methods are described and the technical aspects can be found in appendix  [ sec.isop ] and  [ sec.isopmix ] . in the section  [ sec : results ] results are presented .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] ends the paper with the conclusions .",
    "we consider three systems : pure water , pure solute and water - solute mixture . in the three cases",
    "the system is defined on a body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice .",
    "sites on the lattice can be either empty or occupied by a water or by a solute molecule .",
    "particles representing both water and solute molecules carry four arms that point to four of the nearest neighbor ( nn ) sites on the bcc lattice as illustrated by the figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "the interactions between nn molecules are described in the framework of the lattice patchy models  @xcite .",
    "the particles carry eight patches ( four of them corresponding to the arms in the alg model ) , and each of the patches points to one of the nn sites in the bcc lattice as illustrated in the figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "the water molecules have two patches of the type @xmath7 ( acceptors ) , two patches of the type @xmath8(donors ) and four patches of the type @xmath9 ( which do not participate in bonding interactions ) .",
    "since the patches of the types @xmath7 and @xmath8 participate in the hydrogen bonding , a water molecule can participate in up to four hydrogen bonds .",
    "the structure of the solute is similar to the structure of the water , but it has only one patch of type @xmath7 , the other patch @xmath7 is replaced by a patch of the type @xmath10 that represents the anisotropic group which makes water and the solute different . in the case in which the solute is the methanol @xmath10 is the methyl group while for other alcohols and ionic liquids it does represent larger chains .     and @xmath8 represent the acceptors and donors arms respectively .",
    "the red sphere represent the solute particle and the arms @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the acceptor and donors , and the patch @xmath10 represents the anisotropic group , title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   and @xmath8 represent the acceptors and donors arms respectively .",
    "the red sphere represent the solute particle and the arms @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the acceptor and donors , and the patch @xmath10 represents the anisotropic group , title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]     and @xmath11 represent particle on its respective positions @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "blue sphere represent a water and red , a solute particle . @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the patches b of water and solute respectively .",
    "the patch @xmath9 is not represented here for the clarity of the image.,width=302 ]    the distinction between patches implies @xmath16 possible orientations for the water molecules and @xmath17 possible orientations for the solute molecules .",
    "the potential energy is defined as a sum of interactions between pairs of particles located at sites which are nn on the bcc lattice .",
    "the interaction between particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are nn , only depends on the type of patch of particle @xmath12 that points to particle @xmath13 , and on the type of patch of particle @xmath13 that points to particle @xmath12 .",
    "the values of the interaction as a function of the types of the two interacting patches are summarized in the table  [ tabla1 ] .",
    "the interaction between occupied neighbor sites is repulsive with an increase of energy by @xmath18 with the exception of three cases . for patch - patch interaction of type @xmath19 the energy interaction is taken as : @xmath20 .",
    "if the interaction is of type @xmath21 , with the @xmath8 patch belonging to a solute molecule there is also an attractive interaction @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 , whereas if the patch @xmath8 belongs to a water molecule the interaction energy is given by @xmath24 .",
    "we have considered @xmath25 , and three cases for the @xmath8-@xmath10 water - solute interaction : attraction with @xmath26 , non - interacting with @xmath27 and repulsion with @xmath28 .",
    "the first case represents systems dominated by the water - solute attraction .",
    "this is the case of the methanol in which it is assumed that the methyl group shows a small but attractive interaction with the water .",
    "this also represents the ionic liquids in which the anions groups are hydrophilic and the cationic chains are not too long  @xcite .",
    "the second case represents alcohols with larger non - polar alkyl substituents  @xcite .",
    "the third case represents the ionic liquids in which the combination of the anions and cations lead to an hydrophobic interaction  @xcite . due to the simplicity of our model solute , size and hydrophobicity effects",
    "are not taken into account independently , but both are considered through the @xmath29 parameter .",
    ".interactions between nn particles of the same type ( solute or water ) .",
    "the interaction depends on the patches of both particles involved in the interparticle bond .",
    "the interaction between patches of type c and b depends on the type of molecule : water ( w ) or solute ( s ) that provides the patch b. we consider @xmath30 ; and @xmath31",
    ". patches of types a , b , and c correspond to the four arms of the standard alg model . [",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , @xmath33 the fitting of the simulation results given in table [ table - s0 ] to eq .",
    "( [ eq - s0 m ] ) , with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 being adjustable parameters leads to : @xmath37 where the label @xmath38 refers to water .",
    "considering the quantities @xmath39 $ ] , and fitting the results to @xmath40 we get @xmath41 the values of the exponent @xmath36 agree within statistical uncertainty with the results of berg et al .",
    "@xcite . for the residual entropy of the ordinary ice .",
    "interestingly , our estimate of @xmath42 for our model defined over a system with cubic symmetry and the estimate of for the ordinary ice of berg et al .",
    "@xcite : @xmath43 ; @xmath44 , seem to coincide ( at least within error bars ) in spite of the different structures of the underlying lattices . in principle",
    ", we could apply the same simulation techniques used for the water in the determination of the residual entropy of the lattice gas model of the solute .",
    "however , the value of @xmath32 for methanol can be deduced directly from the water results . given a ground state , the configuration of the water for a system with @xmath45 molecules ( occupied positions ) one can build up @xmath46 directly related ground states for the methanol model , since the two ( undistinguishable ) @xmath7 patches of each particle in the water model correspond to two distinguishable ( @xmath7 and @xmath10 ) patches in the methanol model .",
    "therefore , we get : @xmath47",
    "the excess properties of binary mixtures are usually measured experimentally at fixed conditions of temperature and pressure  @xcite . for lattice gas models",
    "it is neither straightforward not practical the use of simulation in the npt ensemble .",
    "the usual alternative is to carry out simulations in the grand canonical ensemble and compute the pressure by means of thermodynamic integration .",
    "since we are interested in analyzing the excess properties at fixed pressure , we have developed a procedure to build up the lines @xmath48 for pure components , i.e. we fix the pressure and compute the chemical potential as a function of temperature at fixed pressure .",
    "the objective is to apply this to the ordered phases : ldl and hdl .",
    "the pressure at ( very ) low temperature for these phases can be computed from the ground state analysis . in the gce",
    "the change of the pressure for transformations at constant @xmath49 and @xmath50 , is given by @xmath51 .",
    "the density of the condensed phases at very low temperature hardly changes with @xmath52 , therefore , we can integrate the pressure to get .",
    "@xmath53 where the values of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 can be taken as those corresponding to the phase coexistence at low temperature ( eqs .",
    "[ eq.gsw]-[eq.coexm ] ) .",
    "once we now how to compute the chemical potential for a given pressure @xmath57 at a ( low ) temperature @xmath58 , we will develop the integration scheme to move on the @xmath59 plane at the fixed pressure @xmath57 .",
    "imposing @xmath60 in the differential form for the thermodynamic potential of the gce we get : @xmath61 we typically considered systems with @xmath62 .",
    "the excess properties of mixing are usually defined as the differences between the values of the property of the mixture at a given composition , @xmath63 , and the value of the same property for an _ ideal _ mixture of the components at the same conditions of @xmath63 , @xmath49 , and @xmath57 .",
    "it is , therefore , desirable to develop simulation strategies to sample in an efficient way different compositions of a given mixture for fixed conditions of temperature and pressure . in order to achieve this aim for our lattice model",
    "we have borrowed ideas to form the gibbs - duhem integration procedures , as we did for computing isobars of pure components .",
    "the differential form for the grand canonical potential of a binary mixture can be written as : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of molecules of component @xmath12 , and @xmath66 is the chemical potential of component @xmath12 .",
    "if we fix @xmath49 , @xmath57 , and @xmath50 , the chemical potential of the two components can not vary independently when modifying the composition .",
    "it should be fulfilled : @xmath67 using activities @xmath68 $ ] to carry out the integration of eq .",
    "( [ gdi ] ) we get : @xmath69 let us assume that for some values of @xmath49 , and @xmath57 , we know the values of the activities of the pure components @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "we can integrate numerically ( using simulation results ) the differential equation : @xmath72 for instance , using as starting point @xmath73 and considering @xmath74 as the independent variable and integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq.gdi3 ] ) up to @xmath75 , we should reach @xmath76 .",
