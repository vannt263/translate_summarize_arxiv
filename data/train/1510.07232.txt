    "if @xmath2 is a compact complex manifold , the algebraic dimension of @xmath2 , usually denoted by @xmath3 , is defined to be the complex dimension of a projective algebraic variety , the rational function field of which is isomorphic to that of @xmath2 .",

    "not so many compact differential manifolds admit complex structures whose algebraic dimension ranges from zero to half of its real dimension .",

    "only complex tori and k3 surfaces are examples for which all three possible values of the algebraic dimension actually occur . in dimension three , _ twistor spaces _ associated to self - dual metrics on 4-manifolds @xcite are good candidates of such manifolds .    by a result of campana @xcite , if @xmath2 is a moishezon twistor space , then the base 4-manifold is homeomorphic to @xmath0 , the connected sum of @xmath7 copies of complex projective planes ; by convention @xmath8 .",

    "no example seems to be known of a self - dual metric of non - positive scalar curvature on these manifolds . thus if @xmath9 , all known twistor spaces are moishezon .",
    "the situation is very different for @xmath10 .",
    "first , if @xmath11 , for any @xmath12 , there actually exists a twistor space @xmath2 over @xmath13 which satisfies @xmath14 , see @xcite .",
    "also , it is known that @xmath15 as long as the self - dual metric on @xmath13 is of positive scalar curvature @xcite .",
    "moreover , no example seems to be known of a self - dual metric on @xmath13 of non - positive scalar curvature .",
    "thus our understanding of possible values of the algebraic dimension is quite satisfactory in case @xmath11 , too .",
    "the main focus of this article is on the case @xmath1 . for any @xmath1 and @xmath16",
    "it is known that there exists a twistor space @xmath2 on @xmath0 which satisfies @xmath14 , @xcite . moreover , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* main theorem ) , it is stated that there exists a twistor space @xmath2 on @xmath0 with @xmath17 for any @xmath1 .",
    "these spaces satisfy @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the natural square root of the anti - canonical line bundle on @xmath2 , which is available on any twistor space @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the following theorem , which is main result of this article .",
    "[ thm ] if @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a twistor space on @xmath0 such that @xmath20 , then @xmath21 .    at the end of this article",
    "we give a detailed explanation of the contradiction between this result and the result of @xcite .    by a result of @xcite ,",
    "if a twistor space @xmath2 over @xmath0 , @xmath1 , satisfies @xmath22 , then @xmath2 is moishezon .",
    "therefore from theorem [ thm ] , we obtain    if a twistor space @xmath2 over @xmath0 , @xmath1 , satisfies @xmath17 , then the system @xmath23 consists of a single member , or is empty .    to the best of the authors knowledge , existence of this kind of twistor spaces",
    "is not known .",
    "thus the existence of a twistor space on @xmath0 with algebraic dimension two seems to be not known .",
    "here is an outline of our proof of theorem [ thm ] .",
    "assume @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a twistor space over @xmath0 which satisfies @xmath20 and @xmath17 .",
    "it can be seen that the base locus of the pencil @xmath23 is a cycle of smooth rational curves . by blowing up this base curve and then taking a simultaneous small resolution of all ordinary double points that appear by the blow - up",
    ", we get the diagram @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the composition of the blow - up and the small resolution , and @xmath26 is a surjective morphism induced by the pencil @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the exceptional divisor of the birational morphism @xmath25 .",
    "fibres of @xmath26 are naturally identified with members of the pencil @xmath23 .",
    "the exceptional divisor @xmath28 plays a significant role in our proof .",
    "the morphism @xmath26 naturally gives it the structure of a fibre bundle @xmath29 except over a finite number of points .",
    "the typical fibre of is a cycle of rational curves , which is naturally identified with the base curve of the pencil @xmath23 .",
    "fibres over the exceptional points are cycles of rational curves as well , but they have two more irreducible components than the typical fibres , because the exceptional curves of the small resolution are inserted at the ordinary double points of the blow - up .",
    "the presence of these structures follows from the assumption that @xmath30 includes a pencil whose base locus is a cycle of rational curves .",
    "when @xmath17 , any smooth fibre of @xmath26 has to be a rational surface whose anti - kodaira dimension is one . by making use of the zariski decomposition of an anti - canonical curve on the surface ,",
    "we explicitly define a line bundle @xmath31 over @xmath32 which satisfies the following properties :    * an algebraic reduction of @xmath32 is realised by the linear system @xmath33 for @xmath34 , * @xmath31 is trivial along a typical fibre of the fibration .    roughly speaking ,",
    "the line bundle @xmath31 is the ` strict transform ' onto @xmath32 of the line bundle @xmath35 over @xmath2 for some concrete integers @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which are again obtained from the zariski decomposition .",
    "thus the problem of determining @xmath3 is reduced to computing the dimension @xmath38 for arbitrary @xmath39 .",
    "the first observation for this computation is that the line bundle @xmath31 has negative degree along a component of some exceptional fibres of the fibration . from this , together with some properties of the zariski decomposition for the anti - canonical cycle , we can deduce that , for any @xmath40 , the movable part of the linear system @xmath33 is composed with the pencil @xmath41 , and this gives the desired conclusion . in the actual computation ,",
    "we introduce an auxiliary line bundle @xmath42 over @xmath32 for @xmath43 , which coincides with @xmath44 when @xmath45 takes some special value , and show that the system @xmath46 is always composed with the pencil @xmath47 .",
    "finally , a remark about notation . if @xmath48 is a complete linear system on some compact complex manifold and if we write @xmath49 for some effective divisor @xmath50 , then @xmath50 is a fixed component of @xmath48 .",
    "but this does not imply that the system @xmath51 is without fixed component .",
    "we would like to express our sincere gratitude to professor fujiki for his generous and helpful comments about the anti - kodaira dimension of general members of the pencil @xmath23 on the twistor space .",
    "these are reflected not only in the explanation in section 4 but throughout this article .",
    "in this section we fist recall basic properties of the zariski decomposition of a divisor on a projective surface , and then investigate the zariski decomposition of an anti - canonical divisor on a non - singular rational surface of anti - kodaira dimension zero or one .",
    "let @xmath52 be a non - singular projective surface , and @xmath53 an effective divisor on @xmath52 .",
    "then the _ zariski decomposition _ of @xmath53 is the decomposition @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are effective @xmath57-divisors ( i.e.  divisors with positive rational coefficients ) or the zero divisor , which satisfy    1 .",

    "note that if @xmath66 is the zariski decomposition of @xmath53 , then for any integer @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the zariski decomposition of @xmath69 .",
    "one of the most important properties of the zariski decomposition is that it disposes of sub - divisors of @xmath69 which do not contribute to the dimension @xmath70 in the following sense :    [ prop : z1 ] ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.4 ) ) let @xmath71 and @xmath72 be as above , and @xmath67 an integer .",

    "typical examples of rational surfaces with @xmath86 are del pezzo surfaces , while simple examples with @xmath87 are obtained from @xmath88 by blowing up the 9 intersection points of two anti - canonical ( i.e.  cubic ) curves .    the anti - kodaira dimension of rational surfaces was investigated in more detail by f.  sakai @xcite .",
    "his main tool was the zariski decomposition of the anti - canonical divisor .",

    "fujita @xcite has shown that any pseudo effective divisor @xmath53 has a unique zariski decomposition @xmath66 with the same properties as above except that @xmath55 is no longer required to be effective . therefore ,",
