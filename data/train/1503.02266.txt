    "after these two transmissions , all mobile devices have the complete set of packets .",

    "we consider a setup with @xmath13 cooperative mobile devices ( nodes ) , where @xmath14 is the set of devices in our system with @xmath15 .",
    "these devices are within close proximity of each other , so they are in the same transmission range .",

    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "our system model consists of two stages . in the first stage",
    ", all packets are broadcast to all devices via cellular links . during the first stage",
    ", mobile devices may receive partial content due to packet losses over the cellular broadcast link .",
    "thus , after the first stage , the set of packets that mobile device @xmath20 has successfully received is @xmath21 , and is referred to as _ has _ set of device @xmath22 .",
    "the set of packets that are lost in the first stage at mobile device @xmath22 is referred to as _ wants _ set of device @xmath22 and denoted by @xmath23 . in this paper , we assume that all mobile devices are interested in receiving all packets in @xmath17 . thus , the following equality holds ; @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , we define the set @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "note that the packets in @xmath25 are not received by any devices in the local area during the first stage .    in the second stage ,",
    "missing packets are recovered by utilizing both cellular and local area links .",
    "in particular , a mobile device may receive two recovery packets ; one from cellular and another from local area link , simultaneously . exploiting multiple interfaces",
    "has potential of improving throughput . moreover , employing network coding further improves throughput in this setup .",
    "however , it is crucial to determine which network coded packets should be transmitted over cellular and local area links in this stage .",
    "this is an open problem and the focus of this paper . in particular , in this paper , we propose network coding algorithms for multiple interfaces ( ncmi ) to recover missing packets in the second stage .",
    "namely , we propose  for batch - based network coding and  for instantaneously decodable network coding .    the integral part of our work is to analyze the throughput performance of  and .",
    "we consider the packet completion time as a performance metric , which is defined as follows :    [ def : completion ] packet completion time @xmath27 is the number of transmission slots in the second stage that are required for all mobile devices to decode all packets in their _ wants _ sets .",

    "this assumption does not violate generality , because packets that are not wanted by any of the devices could be removed from @xmath17 .",
    "in this section , we develop a lower bound on the packet completion time when any network coding algorithm is employed by cooperative mobile devices with multiple interfaces .    [",
    "th : lowerbound ] the packet completion time when network coding is employed by cooperative mobile devices with multiple interfaces is lower bounded by : @xmath30    _ proof : _ each mobile device @xmath20 should receive at least @xmath31 packets to be able to decode all the packets in its _ wants _ set , @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the minimum number of packet transmissions is greater than or equal to @xmath32 .",
    "since we have two packet transmissions at each transmission slot ; one via cellular links and the other via local area links , the minimum completion time is @xmath33 in the best case scenario . on the other hand , since the packets in @xmath25 can only be sent through the cellular link , the minimum completion time should be larger than @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the completion time is bounded by @xmath35 . furthermore , since the completion time can only have an integer value , the completion time is lower bounded by @xmath36 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "@xmath37    note that the lower bound on @xmath27 in ( [ eq : lower ] ) considers the best case scenario and characterizes the performance of network coding for this scenario .",
    "however , the actual completion time may be larger than the lower bound provided in ( [ eq : lower ] ) , so we develop  and  in the next section , and characterize their upper bounds .",
    "[ [ section ] ]      as we mentioned earlier in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] , our system model consists of two stages . in the first stage , all packets are broadcast to all devices via cellular links without network coding . in the second stage ,",
    "both cellular and local area links are utilized simultaneously and network coding is employed . in particular ,",
    "both the source and a local area node transmit network coded packets simultaneously at every transmission slot until there is no missing packet in the local area .",
    "next , we explain how network coding is performed by the source and in the local area .",
    "the source node ( i ) determines the missing packets in all mobile devices in the local area , ( ii ) transmits linear combinations of these packets ( using random linear network coding over a sufficiently large field ) over cellular links .",
    "these network coded packets are innovative and beneficial for any node @xmath22 for which @xmath38 , because these network coded packets carry information about all missing packets in the local area . after each transmission , if the received packet is innovative for node @xmath22 , it is inserted into @xmath21 set .",
    "the procedure continues until each node @xmath22 receives @xmath31 innovative packets .    on the other hand , in the local area , a mobile device @xmath39 with the largest _",

    "the transmitter linearly combines all packets in its _ has _ set , @xmath41 , and broadcasts the network coded packet to all other mobile devices in the local area .",
    "after each transmission , if the received packet has innovative information for node @xmath22 , the received packet is inserted into the _ has _ set of node @xmath22 .",
    "note that the network coded packets that include packets from @xmath26 can only be transmitted from the source , since these packets do not exist in the local area .",
    "therefore , the local area devices stop transmitting network coded packets if each node @xmath22 receives ( i ) @xmath42 innovative packets from the local area , or ( ii ) @xmath31 innovative packets from both the source and local area devices .",
    "note that in , there might exist more than one device that have the same set of network coded packets in their _ has _ sets . in this case , without loss of generality , we consider these devices as one device to make network coding decisions .",
    "let us consider three mobile devices with the _ wants _ sets ; @xmath43 .",
    "our algorithm combines @xmath44 at the source , and transmits the network coded packet to the local area devices in the first slot .",
    "this transmitted packet is beneficial to all nodes in the local area as it carries information about all missing packets .",
    "meanwhile , in the local area , a device with the largest _ has _ set is selected .",
    "since there is equality in this example ( @xmath45 ) , one device is selected randomly , let us say device @xmath3 .",
    "device @xmath3 transmits linear combinations of @xmath46 .",
    "note that this network coded packet is beneficial to both device @xmath5 and @xmath8 as it carries information about their missing packets .",
    "thus , in the first slot , the source transmits linear combination of @xmath44 and device @xmath3 transmits the linear combination of @xmath46 simultaneously . in the next slot",
    ", the source transmits another linear combination of @xmath44 , while either @xmath5 or @xmath8 transmits a network coded packet as the sizes of their _ has _ sets are @xmath47 ( the sizes of their _ has _ sets are increased by two because of the first transmissions ) and the size of node @xmath3 s _ has _ set is @xmath48 ( the size of its _ has _ set is increased by one , because it was the transmitter in the first transmission . ) .",
    "the same procedure is repeated at every slot until each node receives @xmath49 innovative packets .",
    "next , we characterize how long it takes until all missing packets are recovered ; _ i.e. , _ the completion time ; @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath12      [ th : easy_upper_bound ] packet completion time ; @xmath27 when  is employed by cooperative mobile devices with multiple interfaces is upper bounded by @xmath50    _ proof : _ the proof is provided in appendix a.@xmath37    [ [ section-1 ] ]    in this section , we develop , where packets are network coded in a way that they can be decoded immediately after they are received by their destination mobile devices .",

    "each element of @xmath53 is constructed by network coding all packets in a vector if the vector satisfies the following condition : the vector s @xmath62th element should be null . construct @xmath52 using the remaining vectors .",
    "the packets in @xmath25 can only be transmitted from the base station ( source node ) , because they do not exist in the local area , so packet recovery in the local area is not possible .",
    "thus , the source node transmits packets from @xmath25 without network coding .",
    "the packets in @xmath53 are network coded packets that can be transmitted by a single transmission from both the source or a local area device . note that network coded packets can be transmitted by a single transmission from the cooperating devices by selecting @xmath62 (",
    "the device with the minimum size of _ wants _ set ) as the transmitter .",
    "thus , @xmath53 is constructed by taking into account which instantly decodable network coded packets can be generated from the device with the minimum size of _ wants _ set .",
    "the packets in @xmath52 are the rest of the network coded packets that can be created and decodable by all mobile devices .",
    "we note that it takes one transmission from the base station and maximum of two transmissions from the cooperating devices to send each packet in @xmath52 .",
    "the reason for this is that the base station has all of the packets , so that any packet combination is available and can be broadcast to all devices . on the other hand , in the local area , there is no guarantee that the network coded packet in @xmath52 can be created and transmitted .",
    "thus , if there does not exist a device that can generate the network coded packet , then a part of the network coded packet is created and transmitted . in this case ,",

    "the set @xmath53 is equal to @xmath74 .",
    "the packets in @xmath53 can be sent from either the base station or from device @xmath3 in the local area , and for both cases one transmission is sufficient . @xmath12    after packets are grouped into sets @xmath25 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , each element in @xmath75 becomes a ( network coded ) packet that is instantly decodable for all or a subset of mobile devices . in particular , after packets are grouped ,  transmits two packets simultaneously at each transmission slot ; one from the base station and another from one of the cooperating devices .",
