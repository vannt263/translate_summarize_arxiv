    "several concepts have been proposed for the design of a commercial power plant based on inertial fusion energy production @xcite .",
    "targets are direct or indirect drive targets but must be at cryogenic temperature @xcite .",
    "they must be injected in the vacuum chamber of the reactor at a rate of about 5 hz and a speed depending on the temperature and the residual pressure of the vacuum vessel @xcite .",
    "the targets are then tracked and hit on - the - fly with laser or heavy ion beams @xcite .",
    "the targets are hollow spherical shells made of beryllium or polystyrene .",
    "their diameter ranges from 2 to 5 mm .",
    "their internal wall must be covered with a solid layer of deuterium or a mixture of deuterium and tritium of several hundred microns in thickness .",
    "the thickness of the layer must be uniform within a few percent .",
    "if tritium is present in the mixture , the beta energy produced by tritium naturally drives the solid to a uniform thickness layer covering the internal walls of the shell @xcite .",
    "if tritium is not present in the liquid layer , it stays at the bottom because of gravity . in this paper , we describe how , by using the diamagnetic properties of the hydrogen , we can compensate this gravity effect and obtain a homogenous thickness of liquid layer inside the sphere before freezing it .",
    "in order to obtain the homogeneous thickness of the liquid layer on the inner walls of a hollow spherical shell , one needs to satisfy simultaneously two conditions :    * the shape of the gas bubble inside the liquid should be spherical , * the gas bubble should levitate in the middle of the shell .",
    "we show now how the various forces influence the satisfaction of these conditions .",
    "the force of the surface tension tends to minimize the interface area .",
    "therefore , the surface tension helps to maintain the spherical shape of the gas bubble . obviously , we need to look for the conditions where the value @xmath0 of the surface tension is large . as a matter of fact , @xmath0 is the decreasing function of the temperature @xmath1 and goes to zero at the critical temperature @xmath2 , which is about 33 k for hydrogen",
    ". the working temperature should thus be at least several degrees smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "the contribution of the surface tension ( i.e. the laplace pressure ) is inversely proportional to the radius of curvature of the interface . for the thicker liquid layer",
    "the radius of the gas bubble is smaller and the laplace pressure is thus larger .",
    "therefore , the thickness of the thicker liquid layer is _ a priori _ more homogeneous ( provided that the gas bubble is levitated in the middle of the shell ) than the thickness of the thinner liquid layer . as a consequence ,",
    "we need to analyze the homogeneity only for the thinnest layer under consideration , which is 200  @xmath3 m . if for this case",
    "the homogeneity 1% criterion is satisfied , it will be satisfied for all larger thicknesses .",
    "since the hydrogen completely wets the solid shell ( zero contact angle ) , the van der waals force manifests itself as an attraction between the hydrogen molecules and the solid wall @xcite .",
    "it thus tends to create the layer of the densest ( liquid ) phase at the shell wall , leaving the less dense phase ( gas ) in the middle of the shell .",
    "however , the value of this force is very small in comparison with the surface tension . while the van der waals force influences strongly @xcite the shape of the layers of microscopic ( of the order of 1 @xmath3 m ) thickness",
    ", we do not expect a strong effect for the case of the thick liquid layers ( average thickness larger than 200 @xmath3 m ) , which we analyze in this report .",
    "we carry out all our calculations for the non - retarded van der waals interactions instead of the more suitable ( because of the large layer thickness ) retarded expression .",
    "the reason is that the retarded interactions are weaker @xcite and would result in even smaller contribution .",
    "the gravitational force per unit volume @xmath4 is proportional to the mass density @xmath5 of hydrogen , @xmath6 being the gravitational acceleration . since the liquid mass density @xmath7 is larger than the gas mass density @xmath8 , the resulting archimedes force @xmath9 that acts on the gas bubble tends to increase the thickness of the liquid layer on the bottom of the shell by lifting the bubble upwards .",
    "gravitation thus needs to be compensated .",
    "the gravity compensation by means of the static magnetic field is based on the expression for the magnetic force per unit volume @xmath10 that acts on a body with the magnetic susceptibility @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the magnetic induction that would be created by the same solenoid in the free space and @xmath13 is the magnetic permeability of free space .",

    ".parameters of hydrogen at @xmath15 k @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the following operations are performed in order to condense and levitate the hydrogen in the sphere :    * the vacuum vessel is pumped out to about @xmath16  mb and the capillary is pumped out to about 0.1  mb . *",
    "the solenoid and the vacuum vessel are cooled down to 2.2  k. * the thermal valve is heated ( a power of 300  mw is necessary ) * the sphere is heated to about 20  k. * hydrogen is slowly introduced into the capillary .",
    "* when a sufficient quantity is condensed inside the sphere , the heater of the valve is cut so that an ice plug clogs up the capillary . *",
    "the current in the solenoid is increased to about 60  a to compensate the gravity .",

    "the equilibrium shape of the interface can be found by two different approaches .",
    "one of them consists in direct numerical minimization of the free energy of the system . in this work",
    "we adopt another , variational approach , in which the minimization itself is performed analytically .",
    "it results in a variational equation that should be solved numerically to obtain the interface shape .",
    "the general form of this variational equation is the laplace equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the local curvature of the interface , and @xmath23 is the difference between the forces per unit area that act on the interface from the liquid and gas sides .",
    "there are several contributions to @xmath23 : @xmath24 that correspond to gravitation ( @xmath25 ) , magnetic field ( @xmath26 ) , and the van der waals force ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the constant @xmath28 is a lagrange multiplier that appears as a result of the constrained gas volume @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath28 can be viewed otherwise as an unknown _ a priori _ difference of pressures inside the liquid and gas phases .",
    "the mathematical expression for the curvature @xmath22 depends on the choice of the reference system and the independent variable .",
    "it is convenient to use the cylindrical @xmath30 coordinate system because the solenoid ( @xmath31 ) axis is vertical and @xmath32 is thus cylindrically symmetric . in this reference system ,",
    "the interface is fully defined by its half - contour for which @xmath33 .",
    "none of the variables @xmath34 can be chosen as independent because for the closed interface contour ( at least ) two values of @xmath31 exists for each value of @xmath35 and vise - versa .",
    "we choose as an independent variable the curvilinear coordinate @xmath36 that varies along the interface contour counter - clockwise with @xmath37 at the point on the symmetry axis where @xmath38 . using this parameterization , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "since @xmath36 measures the running length along the interface contour , the following equation is valid @xmath41 where prime means the derivative @xmath42 .",
    "the expression for the local curvature then takes the form @xmath43 by introducing an auxiliary function @xmath44 , one can reduce ( [ laplace ] ) ( with @xmath22 given by ( [ k ] ) ) to the set of the first - order ordinary differential equations : @xmath45 the physical meaning of the variable @xmath46 can be found out by dividing two last equations : @xmath46 is the angle between the @xmath35 axis and the tangent to the interface contour .    the gas bubble volume @xmath29 is fixed .",
    "this condition allows @xmath28 to be determined from the equation @xmath47 where @xmath40 and @xmath48 are the solutions of the set ( [ syst ] ) and @xmath49 is the unknown _ a priori _ half - length of the interface contour .",
    "four boundary conditions for the set ( [ syst ] ) should be specified at the points @xmath37 and @xmath50 .",
    "three of them serve to determine the integration constants in ( [ syst ] ) and the fourth serves to determine @xmath49 .",
    "there are two possible types of the boundary conditions .",
    "the first type corresponds to the case of the continuous liquid layer @xcite and reflects the symmetry of the contour : @xmath51 the boundary conditions of the second type should be specified when the liquid layer is discontinuous when the van der waals forces are neglected in the calculation and the point @xmath50 is the triple ( gas - liquid - wall ) contact point .",
    "since the contact angle is zero , the boundary conditions take the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the internal radius of the shell .",
    "the mathematical problem is now complete .",
    "however , it is difficult to solve because of the moving boundary conditions specified at the unknown upper boundary @xmath49 .",
    "this problem can be reduced to the simpler problem with the fixed boundary conditions by the following mathematical trick .",
    "we introduce new independent variable @xmath54 and two more dependent variables @xmath49 and @xmath28 . the set ( [ syst ] ) then reduces to @xmath55 where @xmath46,@xmath35,@xmath31,@xmath49,@xmath28 are supposed to be the functions of @xmath56 , prime means now the derivatives @xmath57 , and from now on we express @xmath35 , @xmath31 , and @xmath49 in the units of @xmath53 and @xmath58 in the units @xmath59 .",
    "five unknown integration constants for these five equations should be found from the condition @xmath60 and from the four fixed boundary conditions ( specified at @xmath61 ) for the problem of the first type ( continuous liquid layer ) @xmath62 or of the second type ( discontinuous liquid layer , i.e. direct wall - gas contact ) @xmath63    the set of equations ( [ dp],[set],[vol ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ bound1 ] ) or ( [ bound2 ] ) provide two fully defined fixed boundary mathematical problems if the functional forms of @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are known .",

    "[ compens]b . in the case",
    "when the centers of the shell and of the interface coincide ( it is easy to adjust experimentally by moving the shell with respect to the solenoid ) , this diagram gives the angular variation of the liquid layer thickness .",
    "[ compens]b demonstrates that the liquid layer smoothness is at least one order better than 1% required for the icf targets .    because of the very small value of the van der waals contribution ( indeed , @xmath84 ) , our code did not show any effect of the van der waals forces within the numerical accuracy .",
    "the van der waals forces should manifest themselves only when the gas bubble is pressed against the shell .",
    "due to them , a thin wetting layer ( layer of liquid phase that separates the gas phase from the shell ) forms even in this situation because of the complete wetting conditions .",
    "however , as the thickness of this layer is 100 to 1000 times less than the average thickness in our case , the chosen algorithm does not detect it and becomes unstable .",
    "therefore , in the following we neglect the presence of the wetting layer , assuming that its thickness is zero , i.e. the liquid layer is assumed to be discontinuous , the boundary conditions of the second type ( see section [ sec3 ] ) being used for this case .",

    "the boundary conditions of the first type are applied in this case .      in this subsection",
    "we consider the interface change under the influence of the decrease of the surface tension .",

    "[ compens+1]a from the spherical shape versus polar angle in the @xmath83 plane.,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]    comparing these figures with figs .",
    "[ compens ] , two main differences become apparent .",
    "first , the equilibrium position of the bubble is displaced strongly to the bottom of the solenoid , its center corresponding approximately to the point @xmath87 from fig .  [ force ] . in other words ,",
    "the position of the levitation point is very sensitive to the value of the current .",
    "second , the maximum deviation from the average layer thickness is very sensitive to the current .",
    "[ compens+1]b shows that the 1% increase of the current causes the @xmath88% increase in the maximum deviation .",
    "for the current less than @xmath81 , there is no equilibrium levitation position and the bubble is squeezed against the upper part of the shell .      the squeezed bubble shapes calculated for current values smaller than @xmath89  a are presented in figs .  [ squeezed ] .",

    "[ compens].,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]    one can see that the variation of the current does not influence the shape strongly at a large value of the surface tension ( fig .",
    "[ squeezed]a ) .",
    "these data compares well to the experiments .",
    "however , when the surface tension decreases , the inhomogeneity of the magnetic forces deform the bubble ( fig .",
    "[ squeezed]b ) in full analogy to the case of the levitated bubble shown in fig .",
    "[ suspendu_sigma ] .",
    "the experiments of magnetic levitation of hydrogen , near the triple point , in a hollow semi - transparent spherical shell have been performed . due to the fact that the sphere was not completely transparent , a precise characterization of the liquid layer could not be done .",
    "nevertheless , the obtained images did not show deformation of the gas / liquid interface under the influence of the residual magnetic forces .",
    "our numerical modeling of the gas - liquid interface shape shows that the layer of the liquid hydrogen with a very small thickness variation ( less than 0.1% ) can be achieved by means of magnetic levitation in a superconductive solenoid .",
    "the thickness homogeneity is the best when levitating at the minimum value of the current at which the levitation is possible at all .",
    "although the levitation is possible at a higher value of the current , the thickness variation increases rapidly with the increase of the current .",
    "the higher homogeneity can be achieved for the a larger surface tension ( smaller temperature ) and a larger layer thickness provided that the gas bubble is well centered in the shell .",
    "we investigate now the levitation in a coil based on the magnetic multipole concept .",
    "this coil is similar to coils used for the confinement of particles in accelerators .",
    "such multipoles can levitate hydrogen or deuterium targets by tens or even hundreds at the same time .",
    "this could be a solution to the problem of high production rates required for commercial power plants based on the inertial fusion energy .",
