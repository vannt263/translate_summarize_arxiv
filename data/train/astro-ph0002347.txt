    "the detection of radio synchrotron emission from shell  type supernova remnants ( snrs ) is a clear indication that electrons of typically gev energy are being accelerated in such objects .",
    "there is now convincing evidence that synchrotron emission from some remnants extends to x  ray wavelengths ( pohl & esposito 1998 ) : this implies the presence of electrons with energies of order 10@xmath6ev .",
    "the prime example of this is the remnant of sn1006 , recent observations of which using the asca ( koyama et al . 1995 ) and",
    "rosat ( willingale et al . 1996 ) spacecraft show that x  ray emission from the bright rim has a hard , approximately power  law spectrum .",
    "in contrast , emission from the centre is softer , with a strong atomic line component .",
    "the sharp edges and strong limb brightening observed at both x  ray and radio wavelengths indicate that : the acceleration site is the strong outer shock bounding the remnant ; the acceleration is continuous ; and the local diffusion coefficient of electrons near the shock front is substantially reduced relative to that in the general interstellar medium ( achterberg et al .",
    "the possibility that the x  ray emission from sn1006 is thermal bremsstrahlung has been examined by laming ( 1998 ) , and found to be less tenable than the synchrotron interpretation .    there is thus extensive observational evidence that the strong collisionless shocks bounding shell  type snrs accelerate electrons to relativistic energies .",
    "the standard interpretation of extragalactic radio jet observations is also based on the premise that the relativistic electrons responsible for observed synchrotron emission are produced by shocks , although in this case the shock parameters are much less certain .",
    "heliospheric shocks , on the other hand , do not generally appear to be associated with strong electron acceleration , perhaps because the mach numbers of such shocks are much lower than those of snrs and extragalactic radio jets , although anderson et al .",
    "( 1979 ) have published data showing that kev electrons are produced in the vicinity of the perpendicular bow shock of the earth .    while diffusive shock acceleration ( axford et al . 1977 ; krymsky 1977 ; bell 1978 ; blandford & ostriker 1978 ) provides an efficient means of generating highly energetic electrons from an already mildly relativistic threshold , and can operate at oblique shocks as well as parallel ones ( kirk & heavens 1989 ) , the `` injection '' or `` pre  acceleration '' question remains very open : by what mechanisms can electrons be accelerated from background ( sub  relativistic ) energies to mildly relativistic energies ( levinson 1996 ) ? in this paper , we investigate one of the possible answers , which has attractive `` bootstrap '' characteristics .",
    "specifically , we suggest that waves are excited by collective instability of the non  maxwellian population of ions reflected from a perpendicular shock front , and that these waves damp on thermal electrons , thereby accelerating them .",
    "such a process was first proposed as a candidate acceleration mechanism for cosmic ray electrons by galeev ( 1984 ) .",
    "this model was developed further by galeev et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , with the added ingredient of macroscopic electric fields implied by the need to maintain quasi  neutrality in a plasma with an escaping population of electrons .",
    "mcclements et al .",
    "( 1997 ) carried out a primarily analytical study of electron acceleration by ion ",
    "excited waves at quasi  perpendicular shocks , which was necessarily restricted to quantifying linear rgimes of wave excitation and particle acceleration , in relation to inferred shock parameters .    instabilities driven by shock  reflected ions at snr shocks have also been invoked by papadopoulos ( 1988 ) and cargill & papadopoulos ( 1988 ) as mechanisms for electron heating , rather than electron acceleration . on the basis of a simple analytical calculation , papadopoulos predicted that strong electron heating would occur at quasi ",
    "perpendicular shocks with `` superhigh '' mach numbers ( specifically , shocks with fast magnetoacoustic mach numbers @xmath740 ) through the combined effects of buneman ( two  stream ) and ion acoustic instabilities . in this model",
    "the buneman instability , driven by the relative streaming of shock  reflected ions and upstream electrons , heats the electrons to a temperature @xmath8 much greater than the ion temperature @xmath9 : in these circumstances , the ion acoustic instability can be driven unstable if there is a supersonic streaming between the electrons and either reflected or non  reflected ( `` background '' ) ions . using a hybrid code , in",
    "which ions were treated as particles and electrons as a massless fluid , cargill & papadopoulos ( 1988 ) found that the electron heating predicted by papadopoulos ( 1988 ) could occur in a self  consistently computed shock structure . however , as cargill & papadopoulos point out in the last paragraph of their 1988 paper , the use of a fluid model for the electrons means that hybrid codes can not be used to investigate electron acceleration .",
    "recently , bessho & ohsawa ( 1999 ) have used a particle  in  cell ( pic ) code to investigate acceleration of electrons from tens of kev to highly relativistic energies at oblique shocks in which the electron gyrofrequency @xmath10 exceeds the electron plasma frequency @xmath11 .",
    "an improved theoretical understanding of electron acceleration at shocks is desirable not only for intrinsic interest , but also to enable observations of synchrotron and inverse compton emission to be related quantitatively to shock parameters .",
    "however , almost all work on particle acceleration has concentrated on ions .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first , upstream momentum and energy fluxes are dominated by ions , and the shock structure problem therefore reduces essentially to that of isotropizing the ion distribution .",
    "second , much of our understanding is based on the use of hybrid codes , in which electrons are represented as a fluid : such codes can not provide information on electron acceleration .",
    "however , the very fact that electron dynamics does not appear to be important for shock structure allows us to separate the two problems : prescribing the ion parameters using the results of hybrid code simulations , we can examine in detail physical processes occurring on electron timescales .",
    "this is the approach followed in this paper .",
    "we describe the results of a fully nonlinear investigation , carried out by large scale numerical simulation using a pic code and backed up by analytical and numerical studies , of the underlying plasma physics mechanisms .",
    "we consider the case @xmath12 , which is qualitatively distinct from the strongly ",
    "magnetized rgime investigated by bessho & ohsawa ( 1999 ) .",
    "our primary goal is finding a mechanism capable of producing mildly relativistic electrons : once they have attained rigidities comparable to those of shock  heated protons , they can undergo resonant scattering , and subsequent acceleration to relativistic energies can then proceed via the diffusive shock mechanism .",
    "our approach enables us to test earlier predictions of both electron acceleration ( galeev 1984 ; galeev et al .",
    "1995 ; mcclements et al .",
    "1997 ) and electron heating ( papadopoulos 1988 ; papadoulos & cargill 1988 ) at very high mach number astrophysical shocks .",
    "simulation results are presented for a range of reflected ion speeds in sect .",
    "2 ; plasma instabilities occurring in the simulations , and other processes likely to play a role in electron acceleration and heating at snr shocks , are identified in sect . 3 ; and",
    "the results of these investigations are discussed in sect .",
    "to investigate wave excitation and particle acceleration in the vicinity of a perpendicular snr shock we use an electromagnetic relativistic pic code described by devine ( 1995 ) .",
    "the particle  in  cell principle ( denavit & kruer 1980 ) relies on self  consistent evolution of electromagnetic fields and macroparticles in sequential stages .",
    "relativistic electromagnetic pic codes have been used previously to simulate acceleration processes in astrophysical plasmas ( e.g. mcclements et al .",
    "1993 ; bessho & ohsawa 1999 ) .",
    "a distinctive feature of the code used in the present study is the fact that the energy density of electromagnetic or electrostatic fluctuations can be readily determined as a function of frequency @xmath13 , wavevector @xmath14 or time @xmath15 : this greatly facilitates the identification of any wave modes excited in a particular simulation .",
    "the code has one space dimension @xmath16 and three velocity dimensions @xmath17 . to model a plasma containing",
    "shock  reflected proton beams , we construct a simulation box with 350 grid cells in the @xmath18direction and with the local magnetic field * b * oriented in the @xmath19direction .",
    "mcclements et al . (",
    "1997 ) pointed out that , at any given point in the shock foot , there are in fact two proton beams , one propagating away from the shock , the other towards it . for simplicity , we assume in our pic model that the two beams propagate with equal speeds @xmath20 in opposite directions perpendicular to the magnetic field , and that both background ions and electrons have zero net drift : thus , the simulated plasma has zero current . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is unrealistic , since , in self  consistent models of perpendicular shocks , the magnetic field magnitude has a finite gradient along the shock normal direction , and a finite current is then required by ampre s law ( woods 1969 ) .",
    "we will discuss this approximation in sect .",
    "the frame of reference in each simulation is the upstream plasma frame : time evolution in the simulation can thus be interpreted as spatial variation in the shock foot , with @xmath21 in the simulation corresponding to the interface between the undisturbed upstream plasma and the foot .",
    "the size of the foot @xmath22 lies approximately in the range @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the shock speed and @xmath25 is the upstream ion gyrofrequency ( mcclements et al .",
    "thus , if the simulation is to be confined to the foot , the duration of the simulation should be no greater than @xmath26 where @xmath10 is the electron gyrofrequency ( the true proton / electron mass ratio , 1836 , was used in the simulations ) .",
    "the simulations reported here lasted for either 70 or 135 electron cyclotron periods @xmath27 .",
    "the proton beams were assumed to be initially maxwellian with thermal speed @xmath28ms@xmath29 ( @xmath30 being defined such that the equivalent temperature in energy units is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the proton mass ) , and a range of perpendicular drift speeds @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the electron thermal speed , defined in the same way as @xmath30 and initially set equal to @xmath38ms@xmath29 ( this corresponds to an electron temperature @xmath39 ) .",
    "the value chosen for the total beam number density , @xmath40 , is consistent with the highest values of this parameter found in hybrid simulations of quasi  perpendicular shocks with alvnic mach numbers @xmath41 ranging up to about 60 ( quest 1986 ) .",
    "cargill & papadopoulos ( 1988 ) used @xmath42 in their hybrid simulation of an snr shock ( it was computationally difficult to simulate shocks with higher @xmath41 ) .",
    "the density of each beam @xmath43 is , accordingly , one sixth of the electron density @xmath44 , so that the background proton density @xmath45 required by charge balance is @xmath46 ( the background proton thermal speed @xmath47 was set equal to @xmath48ms@xmath29 ) .",
    "the electron plasma frequency @xmath49 and gyrofrequency @xmath50 in our simulations were set equal to @xmath51hz and @xmath52hz , respectively , corresponding to @xmath53m@xmath54 and magnetic field @xmath55 t .",
    "the ratio @xmath56 is typically of order @xmath57 or higher in hii regions of the interstellar medium .",
    "we have chosen a relatively low value of this ratio in order to study and compare the effects of instabilities occurring on both the @xmath58 and @xmath59 timescales .",
    "the electrons , background protons and each proton beam were represented , respectively , by 3200 , 800 and 7200 particles per cell .",
    "the use of a relatively small number of background protons per cell is justified by the fact that instabilities driven by the proton beams have much higher frequencies than noise fluctuations associated with the background protons : large numbers of electrons and beam protons in each cell ensure a level of noise energy well below the wave energy produced by the instabilities . in what follows we measure time in electron cyclotron periods , using the notation @xmath60 .",
    "we also define @xmath61 ( only waves propagating in the @xmath18direction are represented ) , a normalized frequency @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , @xmath64 being electron velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field .    in every simulation",
    ", transfer of energy from beam protons to electrons was observed , but the power flux between the two species increased dramatically when @xmath20 was raised from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "figure 1 is a time evolution plot of perpendicular kinetic energy @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is electron mass and the summation is over all electrons in the simulation box .",
    "since the total electron number is constant , @xmath67 can be regarded as a measure of the effective perpendicular electron temperature ( although it should be stressed at the outset that the electrons do not always have a maxwellian distribution ) .",
    "the energy is normalized to its initial value , which was identical in the four simulations . when @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( upper plot ) the energy increases by approximately an order of magnitude in around 60100 electron cyclotron periods ; when @xmath68 and @xmath36 ( lower plot ) the energy increases by a factor of about 40 within @xmath69 .",
    "the perpendicular energies of the other two particle populations , again normalized to the initial electron energy , are plotted versus time for the case of @xmath70 in fig .",
    "2 . in the case of the beam protons ( upper plot ) , both bulk motion energy and thermal energy are included . during the simulation the beam proton energy drops by less than 1% , while the background proton energy ( lower plot ) rises by no more than about 10% ( in the other simulations the perpendicular energies of the two ion species changed by even smaller amounts ) . in absolute terms",
    "the energy gained by background protons is very small compared to that lost by beam protons , with almost all the energy being transferred to electrons : we will demonstrate that the beam protons excite an instability which couples them efficiently to electrons .    in all the cases studied ,",
    "electrons were energized in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field . the upper plot in fig .",
    "3 shows , in more detail than fig .",
    "1 , the time evolution of @xmath71 ( once again normalized to its initial value ) in the first 25 electron cyclotron periods of the simulation with @xmath72 . the lower plot shows the time evolution of @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the permittivity of free space , @xmath75 is the @xmath18component of the electric field , and the brackets @xmath76 denote a spatial average over the simulation box . in general",
    ", @xmath77 is the dominant field component : since propagation in the @xmath18direction only is represented , it follows that the waves excited are predominately electrostatic .",
    "henceforth , the term `` electric field '' refers to the @xmath18component .",
    "the field has a single value in each simulation box cell : the electrostatic field energy density @xmath73 is calculated by summing @xmath78 over the box and dividing by the number of cells .",
    "the energy density plotted in the lower frame of fig .",
    "3 is normalized to the perpendicular electron energy density at @xmath79 .",
    "the electron energy grows rapidly in two main phases , at @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and then continues to grow at a slower rate .",
    "the field energy is greatly enhanced at times when the particle kinetic energy is growing rapidly : this suggests strongly that the fields are involved in particle acceleration . in the case of the wave energy burst at @xmath80",
    ", the field energy grows to a level comparable to the electron kinetic energy at that time .",
    "the energy of the burst occurring at @xmath81 , on the other hand , is much lower than that of the electrons .",
    "figure 4 shows the time evolution of @xmath71 and field energy in the simulation with @xmath82 .",
    "the upper plot shows @xmath71 growing on a timescale comparable to the transit time of the simulation box through the shock foot .",
    "the lower plot shows that electrostatic field activity is again correlated with electron acceleration .",
    "figure 4 resembles the second of the two periods of wave growth in fig .",
    "3 ( at @xmath81 ) , in that the wave energy is small compared to the electron kinetic energy .",
    "we now consider the distribution of wave amplitudes in wavenumber space .",
    "figure 5 shows the time evolution of this distribution in the simulation with @xmath72 .",
    "the grey scale shows the base 10 logarithm of the wave amplitude obtained by fourier transforming in space the electric field of one of two counter  propagating waves excited by the ion beams .",
    "the start of the burst in wave energy in the lower plot of fig .",
    "3 at @xmath83 can be identified with the burst at @xmath84 in fig .",
    "5 . this reaches an amplitude of 35 vm@xmath29 , generating a harmonic at @xmath85 .",
    "when the peak amplitude is reached there is an increase in wave energy at @xmath86 .",
    "the frequency of this low @xmath87 noise is close to the upper hybrid frequency @xmath88 .",
    "its appearance correlates with the maximum of the first wave burst at @xmath80 in the lower plot of fig . 3 , and with the strong increase of electron kinetic energy in the upper plot , suggesting that it arises from a redistribution of wave energy and changes in the electron distribution .",
    "after @xmath89 , when the initial wave burst has disappeared , a more broadband perturbation is generated at @xmath90 , the mean @xmath87 decreasing with time . at @xmath91 the wave amplitude peaks at about 16@xmath92vm@xmath29 : this is considerably lower than the peak electric field of 35@xmath92vm@xmath29 in the first burst , but nevertheless strong enough to generate two harmonics ( at @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) .    the corresponding plot for the simulation with @xmath95 is shown in fig .",
    "6 . in this case instability occurs at discrete , regularly ",
    "spaced values of @xmath87",
    ". waves with relatively high @xmath87 ( @xmath96 ) are the first to be driven unstable : during the course of the simulation , the instability shifts to lower discrete wavenumbers .",
    "broadband noise develops at @xmath86 , as in fig . 5 , but at a later time in the simulation ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "this appears to be associated with a more gradual evolution of the electron distribution than that which occurs in the simulation with @xmath98 .",
    "the difference in temporal behaviour between figs .",
    "5 and 6 will be discussed later in this paper .",
    "figures 5 and 6 show that in both simulations the plasma eventually stabilizes , on a timescale which depends on the beam velocity .",
    "the dependence of wave amplitude on @xmath87 and @xmath99 when @xmath100 is qualitatively similar to fig .",
    "5 : after an intense burst early in the simulation , a wave with slowly  varying amplitude is observed to cascade down in @xmath87 as time progresses .",
    "the growth rate of the first wave burst is 20% higher in the simulation with @xmath70 than it is in the simulation with @xmath101 . in the former case , as mentioned above , the peak amplitude of the second burst is 16@xmath92vm@xmath29 , at @xmath102 and @xmath103 ; the corresponding figures for the simulation with @xmath101 are 12@xmath92vm@xmath29 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the wave amplitude distribution in the simulation with @xmath106 is similar to fig . 6 : bursts of wave activity occur at discrete @xmath87 , with the high @xmath87 modes being driven unstable first .    in principle , it is also possible to determine the time evolution of wave amplitude as a function of @xmath107 and @xmath87 .",
    "however , in order to obtain good frequency resolution it is necessary to average the amplitude over times longer than the electron acceleration timescale .",
    "electrostatic waves in the electron cyclotron range propagating perpendicular to the magnetic field include , for example , electron bernstein waves , whose dispersion relation depends on the electron distribution . since this is rapidly evolving , it can be difficult to interpret observed distributions of wave amplitude in @xmath107 and @xmath87 . however , we have found that the most strongly  growing waves in the simulations invariably have @xmath108 : one can thus obtain the frequencies of the high intensity modes in figs . 5 and 6 by multiplying @xmath87 by @xmath109 .",
    "by this means , it is straightforward to verify that the modes excited early in both simulations have @xmath110 , and hence @xmath111 .",
    "short  lived bursts of narrowband wave activity , correlated with rapid increases in electron kinetic energy , occur for all four values of @xmath109 considered above .",
    "these bursts appear throughout the simulations with @xmath82 and @xmath112 ; in the case of @xmath101 and @xmath70 , they appear only at early times . in every case ,",
    "the instability cascades to longer wavelengths in the course of the simulation . in order to compare the simulation results with those given by linear instability analysis ( described in the next subsection ) , we determine growth rates for the first wave that interacts significantly with the electrons : in such cases",
    "one may assume that the electrons are still represented by a single maxwellian velocity distribution with thermal speed @xmath37 .",
    "the simulations provide the wavenumber @xmath87 of the unstable wave modes and the electric field amplitude @xmath113 .",
    "the real frequencies @xmath107 of the unstable wave modes are assumed to be equal to @xmath114 .",
    "the normalized growth rate @xmath115 is estimated by fitting an exponential to the plot of wave amplitude versus time during the period of most rapid growth in each simulation .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in table 1 .",
    "the symbol @xmath116 denotes the maximum value of @xmath113 during each simulation . in three of the four simulations",
    "there is a period of wave growth which can be described accurately as exponential . in each case",
    ", the growth rate falls to zero , and the wave decays : an example of this behaviour , for the case of @xmath70 , is shown in fig . 7 , where wave amplitude ( defined as in figs",
    ". 5 and 6 ) at @xmath117 is plotted versus normalized time . a possible reason for wave collapse ( observed in all four simulations )",
    "will be discussed later in this paper . in the case of @xmath33 ,",
    "the mode referred to in table 1 ( @xmath85 ) is the second to be destabilized in that simulation .",
    "it appears to grow linearly rather than exponentially : for this reason , no figure is given for its growth rate .",
    "the first mode to be destabilized in this simulation , with @xmath94 , does not grow to a large amplitude ( compared to the noise level ) , and so it is difficult to determine its growth rate .",
    "later in the paper we will present evidence of wave  wave interaction between the second mode excited ( @xmath85 ) and the third mode excited ( @xmath118 ) , which may help to explain the linear growth of the latter .    0.5 cm * table 1 . *",
    "parameters of highest intensity wave mode in each simulation .",
    "0.2 cm    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.5 cm    comparing tables 1 and 2 , we see that waves are excited with amplitudes exceeding @xmath119 in all four cases . for the simulation with @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "this ratio rises to 1.2 for @xmath122 , 10 for @xmath101 , and 19 for @xmath70 . in the latter two cases , as we have seen ,",
    "waves are excited with @xmath123 , for which island formation occurs regardless of the value of @xmath113 . the fact that @xmath124 at higher values of @xmath20 indicates that the phase space in these simulations is characterized by strong stochasticity .",
    "the waves rapidly collapse , however , soon after the onset of strong electron acceleration . in the other two simulations , the peak amplitudes are only just sufficient for island formation to occur , and it is likely that little stochasticity occurs in the system phase space .",
    "the waves excited in these simulations decay more gradually than those produced at higher @xmath20 .",
    "we now consider possible explanations for two of the results noted above : the sharp rise in wave amplitude when the beam speed is raised from @xmath34 to @xmath35 ; and wave collapse , which occurs in all four simulations but is particularly rapid in the two simulations with higher @xmath20 .",
    "as far as the dependence of wave amplitude on @xmath20 is concerned , the first point to note is that the unstable waves all satisfy @xmath125 . in each simulation",
    "the total number of computational particles is , of course , finite , the maxwellian electron velocity distribution being initialized up to @xmath126 .",
    "thus , the beams with @xmath101 and @xmath36 excite waves with phase velocities exceeding the velocity of any electron in the simulation : this is not so in the simulations with @xmath120 and @xmath34 .",
    "the minimum electron velocity required for wave  particle interactions is the phase velocity of the wave : thus , only the slow beams can excite waves capable of interacting with electrons at the start of the simulations .",
    "particle interaction results in electron acceleration , the energy for this being drawn from the wave .",
    "this energy loss may account for the relatively low peak electric field amplitudes of waves excited by the slow beams .",
    "the waves generated by the fast beams , on the other hand , can not initially interact resonantly with the electron population , and so their amplitudes can grow to levels much higher than @xmath119 .",
    "sufficiently high wave amplitudes can activate a second acceleration mechanism , which arises from particle trapping in the wave electric field ( karney 1978 ) : electrons with an initially monotonic decreasing distribution are re  distributed uniformly within the trap , the result being a net increase in kinetic energy .",
    "the wave can trap electrons with perpendicular velocities differing from the wave s phase velocity by up to @xmath127 , where @xmath128 for @xmath101 , the maximum electric field is 23@xmath92vm@xmath29 and the wavenumber @xmath14 is @xmath129m@xmath29 . in this case @xmath130ms@xmath131 . for @xmath70 ,",
    "the maximum field is 35@xmath92vm@xmath29 and @xmath132m@xmath29 , so that @xmath133ms@xmath134 .",
    "the waves excited in the simulations with higher beam speeds can thus trap electrons deep within the electron thermal population : a large number of electrons can then be pre  accelerated to velocities comparable to the wave s phase velocity , with further acceleration taking place via the stochastic mechanism discussed previously .",
    "a two  stage process of this type was proposed by karney ( 1978 ) .",
    "whereas the first burst of wave activity in fig .",
    "3 contained more energy than the electron population , the energy in the second burst was much lower than the perpendicular electron kinetic energy by that stage of the simulation .",
    "this may have been due to the first burst resulting in trapped electrons populating the region of phase space at @xmath135 , via the trapping mechanism .",
    "the perpendicular electron velocity distribution would then be considerably broader than it was initially , with an effective thermal speed @xmath136 .",
    "the beam distribution , on the other hand , did not change significantly during the simulation ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and so @xmath137 .",
    "the situation would then be similar to that of the simulations with lower beam speeds , in which electrons can immediately absorb energy from waves with @xmath138 , and one would expect any subsequent wave burst to have a peak energy much lower than that of the electron population , as observed .    with regard to the second observation , wave collapse , it is interesting to note that in every case the wave amplitude falls to a level well below @xmath119 : intuitively , one would have expected the waves to cease interacting with electrons , and hence to reach a steady  state level , when their amplitudes had fallen below @xmath119 .",
    "the collapse may be associated with changes in the dispersion characteristics of the wave mode resulting from strong particle acceleration .",
    "karney ( 1978 ) justified his hamiltonian approach by considering only stochastic regions of phase space , at particle speeds ( and hence wave phase speeds ) greatly exceeding @xmath37 .",
    "the stochastic regions thus lie in the high velocity tail of the initial maxwellian electron distribution , and most electrons are not initially affected by the wave ",
    "particle interaction .",
    "however , in the simulations with @xmath139 , @xmath36 the reduction in @xmath140 noted above means that perpendicular electron speeds are no longer small compared to the wave phase speed , and we find that there is a transition from the pure buneman instability shown in fig . 8 to the more complicated instability shown in fig . 9 : the latter , as we have discussed , has a buneman  like envelope , but also has cyclotronic features , and in fact linear stability analysis shows that the variation of @xmath13 with @xmath14 in this case is characteristic of the beam / electron bernstein mode discussed in subsect . 3.1 .",
    "as @xmath140 falls , the maximum growth rate drops considerably , but remains positive if the electrons retain a maxwellian distribution .",
    "however , as we now demonstrate , the electron distributions occurring in the simulations are often far from maxwellian .      from the simulation results we have evaluated the distribution of perpendicular electron speeds @xmath141 , defined such that @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the total number of electrons in the simulation .",
    "with this definition , a maxwellian velocity distribution is of the form @xmath144 , decreasing monotonically for @xmath145 .",
    "one advantage of plotting a distribution in this way is that the thermal speed of a maxwellian can be readily identified graphically , being the speed at which @xmath146 . in fig .",
    "11 @xmath141 is plotted for @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 in the simulations with @xmath33 ( dash  dotted curves ) and @xmath151 ( solid curves ) .",

    "using particle  in  cell ( pic ) simulations and linear stability theory , we have shown that electrostatic waves in the electron plasma range , excited by ions reflected from a high mach number perpendicular shock , can effectively channel the free energy of the shock into electrons .",
    "such shocks are known to be associated with snrs , and the processes investigated in this paper may thus help to account for both x  ray thermal bremsstrahlung and the creation of `` seed '' electron populations for diffusive shock acceleration to mev and gev energies in such objects .",
    "the simulation results provide confirmation of a proposal by papadopoulos ( 1978 ) and cargill & papadopoulos ( 1978 ) that streaming between reflected ions and upstream electrons can give rise to a strong buneman instability . whereas these authors assumed that the sole effect of the buneman instability would be electron heating ,",
    "the pic simulations show acceleration  the development of strongly non ",
    "maxwellian , anisotropic features in electron velocity distributions .",
    "the maximum electron velocities are considerably higher than those expected on the basis of quasi  linear theory",
    ": this implies that nonlinear wave  particle interactions are contributing to the acceleration . when the beam speed is greater than about four times the initial electron thermal speed , thermalization of the electron population is observed after saturation of the buneman instability , the final electron temperature being of the order of 1012@xmath92kev .",
    "it is possible that the acceleration process identified in this paper may be relevant to oblique shocks as well as strictly perpendicular ones .",
    "a necessary requirement is the presence of reflected ion beams , which have been observed ( sckopke et al .",
    "1983 ) upstream of both quasi  parallel and quasi  perpendicular regions of the earth s bow shock ( the term `` quasi  perpendicular '' is conventionally used to describe a shock at which the angle @xmath188 between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field is greater than 45@xmath189 ) .",
    "leroy et al . ( 1982 ) used a hybrid code to simulate ion reflection at shocks with a range of values of @xmath188 , finding very similar results for @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "they inferred from this that hybrid simulations which use strictly perpendicular geometry may be compared with observational data of quasi ",
    "perpendicular shocks .",
    "additional necessary requirements for electron acceleration via the buneman instability are that the projection of the reflected ion beam velocity onto the plane perpendicular to the upstream field exceed the upstream electron thermal speed , and that the plasma be weakly magnetized , in the sense that @xmath12",
    ". when these conditions are satisfied locally , the buneman instability will occur .",
    "whether this instability is sufficient to produce significant electron energization at oblique shocks as well as perpendicular and nearly perpendicular ones remains to be demonstrated , however . in the simulations presented in this paper",
    ", acceleration occurred on timescales shorter than an ion cyclotron period .",
    "it was not necessary to represent the shock foot structure , since this has dimensions of the order of a reflected ion larmor radius , and for this reason @xmath188 is not explicitly a parameter in our model .",
    "leroy et al . (",
    "1982 ) have noted , however , that extrapolations of results obtained for nearly perpendicular shocks ( @xmath192 ) to more oblique shocks should be treated with caution , since the physical processes governing the shock structure can be expected to change as @xmath188 is reduced .",
    "the simulation results and our analysis of them suggest that the damping of waves in the electron plasma range at perpendicular snr shocks could provide a solution to the cosmic ray electron injection problem .",
    "although wave  particle interactions at such shocks have been invoked previously in this context ( galeev 1984 ; papadopoulos 1988 ; cargill & papadopoulos 1988 ; galeev et al .",
    "1995 ; mcclements et al .",
    "1997 ) , the simulation results presented here contain several new features .",
    "these include : the acceleration , rather than heating , of electrons via the buneman instability ; the acceleration of electrons to speeds exceeding those of the shock  reflected ions producing the instability ; and strong acceleration of electrons perpendicular to the magnetic field . the wave  particle mechanisms proposed by galeev ( 1984 ) and mcclements et al .",
    "( 1997 ) gave rise to electron acceleration primarily along the magnetic field .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration , which is probably essential for the production of ultra ",
    "relativistic electrons , can occur when the electrons have magnetic rigidities comparable to those of ions flowing into the shock .",
    "since , however , the diffusive shock mechanism requires electrons to be rapidly scattered , its efficacy does not depend sensitively on the initial pitch angle distribution .",
    "the geometry of the simulations described here ( * b * perpendicular to the one space dimension ) excludes the possibility of acceleration by electrostatic waves along the parallel direction .",
    "the present model is complementary to those of galeev ( 1984 ) , galeev et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and mcclements et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , in that it provides an alternative means of energizing electrons at perpendicular shocks . at a real snr shock , perpendicular acceleration via the buneman instability and parallel acceleration via wave excitation at @xmath193",
    "are both likely to occur .",
    "pic simulations in two space dimensions would make it possible to assess quantitatively the relative contributions of these two types of instability to electron energization under a range of conditions .",
    "we discuss finally our neglect of the finite plasma current present in the foot region of perpendicular shocks .",
    "this approximation does not appear to have introduced unrealistic elements into our simulation results , except insofar as the absence of a finite drift between the electrons and background protons removes a possible source of drive for the ion acoustic instability , invoked as one of the electron heating mechanisms in the model of papadopoulos ( 1988 ) .",
    "however , if the background protons and electrons flowing into the shock foot are approximately isothermal , it seems unlikely that any instability excited by their relative streaming could result in a significant transfer of energy from one species to the other .",
    "another possibility is that ion acoustic instability could result from the streaming of beam protons relative to electrons .",
    "this would require , however , the electron temperature to be extremely large compared to the beam proton temperature ( ion landau damping strongly suppresses the instability when the temperatures are equal ) : even in the simulation which produced an effective electron temperature of 80 times the initial temperature , this condition was not satisfied .",
    "thus , the simulation parameters were such that the ion acoustic instability could not occur .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the curve corresponding to @xmath70 in the lower frame of fig . 1 bears a certain resemblance to a curve in fig .",
