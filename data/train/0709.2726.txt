    "the kinetic and atomistic origin of a material parameter that plays the role of the step stiffness are the subject of this article . for a step edge or an island boundary on an epitaxial crystal surface",
    ", we use the detailed kinetic model formulated by caflisch et al .",
    "@xcite and further developed by balykov and voigt @xcite for the dynamics of the boundary .",
    "the basic ingredients are : ( i ) diffusion equations for adatom and edge - atom densities on terraces and along step edges ; ( ii ) a convection equation for the kink density along step edges ; and ( iii ) constitutive , algebraic laws for adatom fluxes , sources for kinks and the kink velocity by mean - field theory .",

    "on the other hand , the _ kinetics _ in  @xcite are different for edge - atoms and kinks , since edge - atoms can hop at rate @xmath10 , while kinks move through detachment of atoms at rate @xmath36 .",

    "we are aware that the mean - field laws applied here , although plausible and analytically tractable , pose a limitation : actual systems are characterized by atomic correlations , which can cause deviations from this mean - field approximation . in particular , the validity of the mean - field assumption may be limited to orientation angles @xmath0 in some neighborhood of @xmath39 . note also that the most interesting results of this analysis are for @xmath0 near zero .",
    "determination of the range of validity for this model is an important endeavor but beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "an extension of this model , which could improve its range of validity , would be to explicitly track the kinks in a step edge .",
    "this additional discreteness in the model would make the analysis of step stiffness more difficult .",
    "our analysis is a systematic study of predictions from the mean - field approach only , and the conclusions presented here are all derived within the context of this approach . on the other hand ,",
    "our analysis is more detailed than previous treatments of step stiffness , since it is based on kinetics rather than a thermodynamic driving force .",
    "moreover , the model includes atomistic information , through a density of adatoms , edge - atoms and kinks .    for evolution near the kinetic steady state",
    ", we derive for the mass flux , @xmath9 , a term analogous to the gibbs - thomson formula  ( [ eq : gt ] ) , and subsequently find the corresponding angular dependence of the step stiffness , @xmath1 .",
    "our main assumptions are : ( i ) the motion of step edges or island boundaries is slower than the diffusion of adatoms and edge - atoms and the convection of kinks , which amounts to the `` quasi - steady approximation '' ; ( ii ) the mean step edge radius of curvature , @xmath40 , is large compared to other length scales including the step height , @xmath7 ; and ( iii ) the edge pclet number , @xmath2 , given by  ( [ eq : pdef ] ) is sufficiently small , which signifies the usual regime for molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) . to the best of our knowledge , the analysis in this paper offers the first kinetic derivation of a gibbs - thomson type relation and the step stiffness for all admissible values of the step edge orientation angle , @xmath0 .",

    "more generally , our analysis can serve as a guide for kinetic derivations of the gt relation in other material systems .",

    "this asymmetry amounts to an ehrlich - schwoebel ( es ) effect  @xcite , due to geometric effects rather than a difference in energy barriers .",
    "in addition , if the terrace adatom densities are treated as input parameters , the adatom fluxes involve effective _ permeability _ rates , by which a fraction of adatoms directly hop to adjacent terraces ( without attaching to or detaching from step edges )  @xcite .",
