    "rr lyrae stars can be found everywhere in our galaxy .",
    "thousands of them have been discovered in wide - field surveys such as : asas , catalina , macho , nsvs , ogle , ptf , quest , sdss , sekbo , vvv .",
    "rr lyrae stars are divided into fundamental - mode ( type rrab ) , first - overtone ( type rrc ) , and rarely found double - mode ( type rrd ) pulsators .",
    "rrab stars are on average intrinsically brighter and have higher amplitudes than rrc stars .",
    "more importantly , rrab variables with their characteristic saw - shaped light curves , in comparison to nearly - sinusoidal light curves of rrc stars , are hard to overlook making the searches for this type of variables highly complete .",
    "rrab stars have also a very practical photometric property .",

    "since the installation of a 32-chip camera with 1.4  deg@xmath0 field of view in 2010 , the project has been in its fourth phase ( ogle - iv , ) and focuses on large - scale monitoring . currently , ogle monitors about 1.3 billion stars located in dense regions of the sky such as the galactic bulge , galactic disk , and magellanic clouds , by covering a total area of over 3000 deg@xmath0 .",
