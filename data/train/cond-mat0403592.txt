    "the interaction between electromagnetic field and the molecules of condensed matter shifts the frequency of the photon oscillators which changes the free energy of the condensed matter system .",
    "this free energy shift is known as the casimir effect@xcite . from a quantum field",
    "theoretical viewpoint , the casimir free energy is the contribution due to one photon loop feynman diagrams@xcite .",
    "originally , casimir intended to describe either photon oscillator induced forces between a few atoms or between fixed perfect conductors .",
    "presently casimir effects include the dielectric and paramagnetic materials as well as irreversible effects in moving conductors@xcite .",
    "the literature is quite extensive but several excellent reviews are available@xcite .",
    "our purpose is to point out that if the coupling between the photon oscillators and the molecules is sufficiently strong , then the photon oscillators undergo a displacement into a coherent electromagnetic radiation state .",
    "while the single photon loops do not describe the nature of the radiation coherence , the phase boundary between the normal radiation state and the coherent radiation state can be located as a free energy instability . as the thermodynamic equation of state boundary of the normal photon oscillator regime",
    "is approached , one or more of the photon oscillator frequencies tends toward zero .",
    "such zero frequency modes lead to a casimir free energy signature of the forthcoming radiation transition .    in sec.[phase_shift ] , the connection between the change in the photon density of states free energy and the photon scattering phase shift is reviewed .",
    "the casimir free energy then follows by directly superimposing the planck free energies of the shifted oscillators . in sec.[propagator ] , the free energy is expressed directly in terms of the ( gauge invariant ) electric field photon propagator @xmath0 and the dielectric susceptibility @xmath1 .",
    "the casimir instability is explored in sec.[polarization ] ( eventually in terms of the dielectric response function @xmath2 ) .",
    "the phase regime of the casimir photon oscillator stability is shown to be identical to the phase regime of the stable clausius - mossotti theory@xcite .",
    "the general physical principles involved are discussed in the concluding sec.[physics ] .",
    "consider a condensed matter object which can elastically scatter photons .",
    "mathematically the scattering of a photon having frequency @xmath3 would be described by a unitary scattering operator @xmath4 whose eigenvalues determine a set of phase shifts @xmath5 via @xmath6 the wigner time delay@xcite @xmath7 in a photon scattering channel @xmath8 represents the extra amount of time the photon remains in the neighborhood of the target due to the photon - target interaction .",
    "it is well known to obey @xmath9 if one sums the time delays over all the channels , then one may compute the extra number @xmath10 of photon states in a bandwidth @xmath11 due the target - photon interaction @xmath12 the casimir contribution to the condensed matter object free energy may be written in terms of the free energy @xmath13 of a simple harmonic oscillator ; i.e. @xmath14 the casimir free energy is found by simply summing oscillator free energies over all the added photon modes as dictated by eqs.([scatter3 ] ) and ( [ scatter4 ] ) ; it is @xmath15 now consider the analytic continuation from real frequency @xmath3 to the complex frequency @xmath16 in the upper half plane @xmath17 the analytically continued scattering operator obeys the dispersion relation @xmath18 our final expression for the casimir free energy in terms of the analytically continued scattering operator follows from eqs.([scatter5 ] ) and ( [ scatter7 ] ) to be @xmath19 let us now consider the more general case wherein the scattering operator may also describe inelastic processes such as photon absorption by the condensed matter sample . the eigenvalue problem , @xmath20 ,",
    "now yields complex phase shifts with @xmath21 .",
    "however , the casimir free energy eq.([scatter8 ] ) remains in tact .",
    "this is most easily understood in terms of the photon propagator .",
    "starting from maxwell s equations @xmath22 one finds that @xmath23 for any locally conserved charge @xmath24 , there exists a polarization @xmath25 such that @xmath26 if we invoke the retarded tensor propagator @xmath27 then eqs.([propagator3 ] ) and ( [ propagator4 ] ) are formally solved by @xmath28 wherein the incoming photon is described by an electric field obeying the vacuum wave equation @xmath29 and the outgoing photon has been scattered by the polarization @xmath25 .",
    "the use of the formal operator replacement @xmath30 may be illustrated as follows : the polarization response in the condensed matter target may be related to the electric field by employing a retarded non - local response function @xmath31 \\cdot { \\bf e}({\\bf r}^\\prime , t)d^3{\\bf r}^\\prime , \\nonumber \\\\ { \\bf p}({\\bf r},t)&=&\\int { \\bf \\chi } \\left({\\bf r},{\\bf r}^\\prime , \\zeta = i\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial t}\\right ) \\cdot { \\bf e}({\\bf r}^\\prime , t)d^3{\\bf r}^\\prime , \\label{propagator8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the complex frequency dependent susceptibility defined as @xmath32 the scattering equation follows from eqs.([propagator6 ] ) and ( [ propagator8 ] ) to be @xmath33 the fredholm - jost determinant@xcite @xmath34 and its logarithmic determinant @xmath35 for the scattering integral eq.([propagator10 ] ) are defined as @xmath36 eq.([propagator11 ] ) is related to the determinant of the scattering operator according to @xmath37 .",
    "\\label{propagator12}\\ ] ]    from eqs.([scatter8 ] ) , ( [ propagator11 ] ) and ( [ propagator12 ] ) it then follows that @xmath38 eqs.([propagator14 ] ) yield the `` one loop '' contributions to the free energy which constitutes the casimir effect .",
    "the feynman diagrams are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "if one employs the eigenvalue equation for a photon state @xmath39 , @xmath40 then @xmath41 for the casimir free energy @xmath42 in eqs.([propagator14 ] ) and ( [ propagator16 ] ) to be stable , it is necessary for the eigenvalues to obey the condition @xmath43 if any eigenvalue",
    "( say as a function of temperature ) passes through unity , then the casimir free energy will have an imaginary part .",
    "the transition rate per unit time for the system to make a transition into a stable state is given by @xmath44 .",
    "the casimir one photon loop free energy in fig.[fig1 ] is not sufficient for computing the free energy of the stable ordered radiative phase .",
    "nevertheless , by examining the eigenvalue eq.([propagator15 ] ) equation for the mode , i.e. channel @xmath39 , which becomes unstable , one may gain insights into the radiative coherent state which will be stabilized .",
    "the phase diagram for the disordered to ordered radiative state may also be computed .",
    "let us illustrate how this comes about .",
    "from eqs.([propagator6 ] ) , ( [ propagator8 ] ) and ( [ propagator15 ] ) one may examine the electric field of a channel mode @xmath39 according to @xmath45 eq.([polar1 ] ) can be decomposed into two parts : ( i ) the mode @xmath46 produces a polarization @xmath47 .",
    "( ii ) the polarization @xmath47 radiates the electric field @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath48 if the eigenvalue @xmath49 passes through unity , then the field mode can be sustained self consistently indicating a radiative instability .",
    "otherwise , the coupling is two weak to maintain the mode and the casimir free energy contribution is stable .    to see what is involved , let us consider a translational invariant fluid for which the bulk casimir free energy per unit volume @xmath50 is determined by electric susceptibility @xmath51 in detail , eqs.([propagator5]),([propagator14 ] ) , ( [ propagator16 ] ) , ( [ polar2 ] ) , and ( [ polar3 ] ) imply @xmath52 the _ static _ ( @xmath53 ) contribution to the free energy per unit volume in eq.([polar4 ] ) is then determined by @xmath54    let us examine eqs.([propagator5 ] ) and ( [ polar2 ] ) in the limit of zero frequency ; i.e. @xmath55 a static polarization will produce a local dipolar electric field @xmath56 via @xmath57 for a fluid with a volume per molecule of @xmath58 and a nonlocal molecular polarizability @xmath59 , defined by the local field @xmath60 , @xmath61 eqs.([polar7 ] ) and ( [ polar8 ] ) imply the dielectric response function @xmath62    note , in the limit of zero wave vector eq.([polar9 ] ) yields the usual clausius - mossotti formula relating the static dielectric constant to the molecular polarizability @xmath63 the clausius - mossotti stability condition@xcite , @xmath64 has then been shown to follow from the casimir effect stability ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the quantum electrodynamic interaction between molecules and photons gives rise to frequency lamb shifts@xcite which in turn contribute to a shift in the free energy of a condensed matter system .",
    "this casimir contribution to the free energy can become unstable if the interaction coupling is too strong .",
    "the instability is the signature to a phase transition into a state with coherent radiation .",
    "we have exhibited such an instability within the above statistical thermodynamic considerations .",
    "we conclude this work by exhibiting the instability directly in terms of a collective lamb shift .    for zero wave number ( @xmath66 ) but finite frequency ( @xmath67 ) , the dielectric response function of eq.([polar9 ] ) reads @xmath68",
    "if the molecular polarizability @xmath69 can be described by a single excitation frequency @xmath70 via @xmath71 then the dielectric response function @xmath72 gives rise to a shifted frequency @xmath73 the eq.([polar11 ] ) for the stable phase regime requires that the collective lamb shifted frequency @xmath74 be real .",
    "a strong coupling imaginary frequency is a clear indicator of an unstable radiation phase .    while the casimir effect expressions are sufficient to derive the _",
    "stable _ photon oscillator regime in temperature and density , the one photon loop approximation lacks the sensitivity to decide the nature of the radiation ordered state .",
