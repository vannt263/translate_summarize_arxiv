    "one of the key ideas upon which we base our understanding of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is that type 1 and type 2 agn have no intrinsic physical differences , their classification being dominated by the presence / absence of absorbing material in our line  of  sight , which is considered to be orientation ",

    "although this unified model has been extremely successful , additional ingredients are likely needed to account for some observational facts that apparently are in conflict with the expectations . among these",
    ", it is well known that a significant fraction of the brightest seyfert  2 galaxies lack broad optical lines even in polarised light ( e.g. tran 2003 ) . moreover , a ( still relatively small ) sample of seyfert  2 galaxies have been found to be unabsorbed in the x ",
    "rays , thus challenging the unified model ( pappa et al .",
    "2001 ; panessa & bassani 2002 ; brightman & nandra 2008 ; panessa et al . 2009 ; shi et al . 2010",
    "; bianchi et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "various explanations have been proposed to solve the apparent puzzle of unabsorbed seyfert  2 galaxies .",
    "the proposed explanations range from dilution ( the broad , optical lines can be overwhelmed by the host galaxy contribution ) , to large amplitude , long  term variability ( either in luminosity or in absorption properties ) , and signal  to  noise issues .",
    "however , good signal  to  noise optical and quasi  simultaneous x  ray data seem to point towards the real existence of a population of genuine unabsorbed seyfert  2 galaxies ( e.g. panessa et al . 2009 ; bianchi et al . 2012 ) .",
    "at present , some of the best unabsorbed seyfert  2 candidates which have been quasi  simultaneously observed in the optical and x ",
    "rays are ngc  3147 , ngc  3660 and q  2131427 ( bianchi et al .",
    "2012 ) .    from an observational point of view",
    ", unabsorbed seyfert  2 ( and seyfert  2 without hidden blr , hblr ) galaxies are predominantly found at low bolometric luminosity or , correspondingly , low eddington ratio ( bian & gu 2007 ; panessa et al . 2009 ; shi et al . 2010",
    "; wu et al .",
    "2011 ; marinucci et al .",
    "this is generally interpreted via theoretical models in which the broad line region ( blr ) is part of an outflow ( e.g. emmering , blandford & shlosman 1992 ; murray et al .",
    "1995 ; nicastro 2000 ; elitzur & ho 2009 ; trump et al .",
    "for instance , nicastro ( 2000 ) proposes that the blr originates in a disc  wind which is quenched below the critical mass accretion rate at which the accretion disc is gas  pressure  dominated throughout ( @xmath7 in eddington units and for typical radiative efficiency @xmath8 , viscosity parameter @xmath9 , and black hole mass of @xmath10 ) .",
    "although unobscured / non  hblr seyfert  2 are indeed observationally confirmed to have accretion rates lower than the critical one ( trump et al .",
    "2011 ; marinucci et al . 2012",
    "; bianchi et al .",
    "2012 ) , the mere existence of many type 1 seyfert galaxies with clear blr optical lines at much lower accretion rates represents a challenge for such model ( e.g. m  81 , peimbert & torres  peimbert 1981 ; filippenko & sargent 1988 ; ho 2008 ; elitzur & ho 2009 ) . indeed",
    ", the outflow model for the blr / torus formation proposed by elitzur & ho ( 2009 ) on the basis of the original elitzur & shlosman ( 2006 ) description , predicts that the blr should cease to exist only below @xmath11 ( for a @xmath10 black hole ) , more than 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that proposed by nicastro ( 2000 ) .",
    "wang & zhang ( 2007 ) have tested the unified model on a large sample of 243 local seyfert galaxies and have proposed a scenario in which evolution plays an important role by controlling relevant physical parameters such as black hole mass and accretion rate , obscuring torus opening angle , and gas  to  dust ratio of the torus itself .",
    "their evolutionary sequence for seyfert galaxies starts with optically  selected narrow ",
    "seyfert  1 galaxies associated with high eddington ratios and relatively small black hole masses , and ends with unabsorbed seyfert  2 galaxies with no hblr , a stage that is reached when the mass accretion rate is so low that the blr disappears .",
    "on the other hand , wang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) propose a different evolutionary sequence based upon the effects of star formation in agn self  gravitating discs .",
    "these authors propose that warm skins are formed above a star  forming disc due to the diffusion of gas driven by supernova explosions , and show that the system evolution implies the episodic appearance of blr with different properties , according to the specific evolutionary stage .",
    "in particular , wang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) predict the existence of an initial phase ( phase i in their model ) which is characterised by relatively high eddington ratio and no blr , as the line  emitting  region is still forming .",
    "these objects are predicted to be rare ( and , for this reason , they are called _ panda _ agn ) with a @xmath12 per cent probability of occurrence in the overall population .",
    "nevertheless , panda agn can in principle be distinguished from more typical low ",
    "luminosity unabsorbed seyfert  2 galaxies because of their much higher eddington ratio .    here",

    "the temperature derived for gsn  069 is in fact consistent with that expected from thermal accretion disc emission for a relatively small  mass black hole radiating close to its eddington limit , so that the most natural interpretation for the spectral shape is that it represents the high  energy tail of the disc emission .    on the other hand",
    ", other spectral models can equally well describe the data .",
    "in particular , the soft x  ray spectrum of gsn  069 may result from strong comptonization of a seed photons spectrum in a corona with plasma temperature @xmath87 and optical depth @xmath88 .",
    "however , comptonization models suffer from a well known series of parameter degeneracies when applied to limited bandpass data .",

    "we then replace the blackbody with a more physical accretion disc model , namely the model ( done et al .",
    "2012 ; jin et al . 2012 ) and consider simultaneous fits to the x  ray and uv ( m2filter only ) data .",
    "the main model assumptions are the following : the disc emits a colour  corrected blackbody down to a given coronal radius @xmath96 , and the corona is assumed to comprise a two  phase plasma . within the corona",
    ", the available energy is distributed between powering the soft x  ray excess via comptonization in an optically thick plasma , and the standard high  energy power law via comptonization in an optically thin phase .",
    "we first assume a pure thermal accretion disc ( ad ) model , with no additional comptonization component(s ) .",
    "the model depends on black hole mass , eddington ratio , and black hole spin .",
    "we found that statistically equivalent fits could be obtained with non - spinning and maximally spinning black hole models .",

    "if a maximally  rotating kerr black hole is assumed instead , the data are reproduced with the same statistical quality but with larger black hole mass ( @xmath102 ) and lower eddington ratio ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "we conclude that a thermal accretion disc ( ad ) plus x  ray warm absorption model provides a reasonable description of the x  ray and shortest  wavelength uv data of gsn  069 .",
    "next , we consider the possible presence of comptonization in the framework of the model . as no high  energy power law",
    "is seen in the data , we assume that all the energy available to the corona powers only the soft excess emission , which depends on the seed photons temperature ( self  consistently derived from black hole mass and eddington ratio ) and on the coronal parameters ( @xmath87 and @xmath92 ) and size ( @xmath96 ) . however , the uv data from the m  2 filter are not sufficient to remove the degeneracies of the comptonization model , and we can not constrain all the parameters independently .",

    "the super  soft state in xte  j1650500 lasted about one month which , accounting for a linear scaling between timescales and black hole mass , would translate into the possibility that the super  soft state in gsn  069 may last as long as a few thousands of years .",
    "considering that the overall outburst of xte  j1650500 was about 6 months long , the duty cycle for such super  soft state may typically be of the order of 1020 per cent in accreting black holes with eddington ratios above @xmath165 .",
    "a study of the occurrence of these states in the known x ",

    "thick type  2 agn candidates .",
    "both classes of sources are characterised by relatively strong narrow optical lines such as o  iii , the absence of broad optical lines , and the lack of detection in the hard x  rays ( or , in any case , a high @xmath169 ratio ) .",

    "if our interpretation of the soft x  ray emission in terms of ad thermal emission is valid , the detection of any soft x  ray emission in gsn  069 and 2xmm  j123103.2 + 110648 is only possible thanks to their low black hole mass and relatively high accretion rate .",
    "more massive agn with similar or smaller mass accretion rates have ad emission whose high  energy tail does not enter at all the soft x  ray band , so that large black hole mass analogs of gsn  069 will be missed in the x  rays .",
    "in fact , assuming a typical eddington ratio @xmath170 and non  rotating black holes , the ad emission does not reach the soft x ",
    "ray band for @xmath171 at low redshift , so that almost all gsn  069like agn would be mis  classified as compton ",
    "thick candidates in even moderately high  redshift surveys because of their relatively strong o  iii emission and lack of detection at x  ray energies .",
    "hence , there could be an entire population of agn in super ",

    "soft states may be as long as @xmath172 years for typical black hole masses of @xmath5 with a typical duty cycle of 1020 per cent for eddington ratios above @xmath173 , suggesting that the population of super  soft state agn may be non ",
    "if so , gsn  069like objects may contaminate the derived fraction of highly obscured agn in the universe because , as discussed above , they are likely counted as compton  thick agn in current x  ray surveys .",
    "although spectro  polarimetric observations would be needed to conclude that gsn  069 and 2xmm  j123103.2 + 110648 do not have hblr , the lack of broad optical lines and of x  ray cold absorption , together with the observed short timescale x  ray variability in the soft band , suggests that both agn may have intrinsically very weak ( or absent ) blr optical lines .",
    "here we critically consider possible explanations for the lack of blr in these objects in the framework of two popular blr models .      both gsn  069 and 2xmm  j123103.2 + 110648 are outstanding objects not only based on their optical and soft x ",
    "ray properties , but also because they lack hard x  ray emission , which has up to now been considered a hallmark property of accreting supermassive black holes .",
    "the lack of hard x  ray emission may be invoked to account naturally for the lack of broad optical emission lines if the blr clouds need to be confined and in pressure equilibrium with a hot medium . such two  phase blr model was first proposed by mathews ( 1974 ) and then refined by e.g. wolfe ( 1974 ) , mckee & tarter ( 1975 ) and , in much more detail , by krolik , mckee & tarter ( 1981 ) .",
    "in particular , krolik et al .",
    "( 1981 ) show that , depending on the details of the radiation field , cold , dense gas ( i.e. the blr clouds ) can coexist in pressure equilibrium with - and be confined by - hotter , less dense gas ( typically with temperatures of @xmath174  k ) at ionization stages consistent with that of the blr .",
    "the state of the gas is determined by its thermal ( and ionisation ) equilibrium with the irradiating radiation field . at the typical distances of the blr ,",
    "the temperature is roughly governed by the balance between compton heating ( by x  rays ) and inverse  compton cooling ( see however krolik et al .",
    "1981 for a comprehensive study of other possible heating and cooling mechanisms ) . as clear , the predicted temperature sensitively depend on the hard x  ray flux which determines the amount of compton  heating , without affecting so strongly the cooling which depends more on the overall spectrum .",
    "krolik et al .",
    "( 1981 ) show indeed that the extent of the multi  phase region where cold blr clouds are in pressure equilibrium with the hotter inter  cloud medium at the right ionisation state is a monotonic function of the fraction of high energy photons in the radiation field . when hard x ",
    "rays are weak or even absent , the multi",
    " phase character of the equilibrium solutions is lost , and cold , dense clouds can not be confined by the hotter medium ( see also guilbert , mccray & fabian 1983 ) .",
    "the two  phase model for the blr thus predicts the disappearance of the blr emission lines whenever the inter ",
    "cloud medium is not hot enough to support the colder / denser blr clouds .",
    "as the compton temperature tends towards the sed peak in @xmath175 , one can visually estimate that it is roughly @xmath176  k in gsn  069 ( see fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) .",
    "such temperature is nearly two orders of magnitude lower than that required to confine the cold line  emitting clouds in the blr .",
    "it is then quite clear that the lack of hard x  rays in gsn  069 ( and in 2xmm  j123103.2 + 110648 ) corresponds to a case in which the compton temperature is too low to sustain a multi  phase medium , thus preventing thermodynamically the formation of a broad  line emitting region .",
    "more examples of gsn  069like objects with variable levels of hard x  ray emission would be crucial to confirm or discard this idea in the future ( possible examples of hard  x  ray emitters lacking the blr may be mrk  273x and 1es  1927 + 654 , as discussed by bianchi et al .",
    "we will continue to monitor gsn  069 in the x ",
    "rays in the future .",
    "the detection of hard x ",
    "rays sometime in the future will prompt us to perform another optical / uv spectroscopic campaign on this peculiar object , which may be used to confirm / dismiss the above interpretation , and/or to assess the relevant heating / cooling timescales associated with the two  phase blr model observationally .",
    "on the other hand , problems with the two  phase model discussed above have been subsequently recognised ( see e.g. mathews & ferland 1987 ) .",
    "in particular , the compton temperature as derived from current detailed agn sed is typically @xmath177  k , too low from the blr clouds to be stable against drag forces , or for the hot phase to be optically thin to x  ray radiation .",
    "mathews & ferland also point out some problems with the dynamics of the blr clouds in the hot inter  cloud medium and",
    "conclude that the two  phase picture for the blr has to be modified to be consistent with the observed emission line and radiation field properties of agn .",
    "some of the problems of the two  phase model may be solved by considering that blr clouds are part of an outflow ( see e.g. elvis 2000 ) .",
    "an outflowing warm wind ( with typical temperature of @xmath178  k ) with embedded cooler clouds does not suffer from the shear stress problems of fast  moving clouds in a stationary hot atmosphere ( typical of the two  phase model ) , and a geometrically thin wind also largely avoids the compton depth problem pointed out by mathews & ferland ( 1987 ) . the structure of the krolik et al .",
    "( 1981 ) multi  phase medium is then retained rather than abandoned , but many of the problems arising from the presence of an extended , static , hot confining medium are solved quite naturally mostly thanks to the dynamical nature of the outflowing solution . hence , outflow models for the blr have received considerable attention in the last decade .",
    "below , we discuss the implications of our observational results on gsn  069 for outflow  based models of the blr in agn .",
    "the inability of some agn to form the blr is theoretically predicted by several models , mostly based on the idea that the blr is part of an outflow , or disc  wind ( emmerging et al .",
    "1992 , murray et al . 1995",
    "; elvis 2000 ; nicastro 2000 ; elitzur & ho 2009 and references therein ) .",
    "we discuss here the implications of our observational data for models associating the blr with agn outflows . in the discussion",
    "below , we assume the best  fitting parameters of our pure ad model , i.e. m@xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "moreover we assume the standard accretion efficiency @xmath181 for a non  rotating black hole , and a viscosity parameter @xmath182 .    for the above parameters ,",
    "all available models predict that gsn  069 should have developed a disc ",
    "outflow already .",
    "if the blr are associated to disc  winds , broad emission lines should then be present , contrary to our optical spectroscopic observations .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath141 , as inferred from the nlr line luminosity . such lower eddington ratio may be insufficient to give rise to a disc  wind and , moreover , it may be associated with a different accretion flow geometry comprising , for instance , a radiatively inefficient inner part ( hereafter called riaf for simplicity , e.g. begelman et al .",
    "1984 ; narayan et al . 1995 ; yuan 2007 ) , and a standard outer disc .",
    "in fact , most models predict that the transition between a disc  riaf solution and a disc  only one occurs around @xmath183 ( or even above , see e.g. rozanska & czerny 2000 , where the transition to an inner riaf solution is predicted to occur at @xmath184 in agn for @xmath185 ) . if gsn  069 was in the past characterised by a riaf  disc flow , a standard disc ",

    "disc to a radiatively efficient disc  only solution , only the latter being associated with a disc wind .",
    "the state transition from an riaf  disc to a disc  only accretion mode must have occurred some time before 2007 , as the _ galex _ data indicate a high radiative efficiency at that epoch ( see fig .",

    "this would imply that , if the blr forms via a disc wind , its formation timescale is longer than @xmath186  yr , i.e. the time ",
    "span between the _ galex _ observation in 2007 , when gsn  069 already had a high @xmath187 ( see fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) , and the aat optical spectrum in 2010 , where no evidence for a blr is found . is a @xmath186  yr minimum blr formation timescale consistent with a disc wind origin of the blr ?",
    "once the launching / accelerating conditions are met , an outflow should be launched instantly ( light  travel time affects are totally negligible here ) , so the answer appears to be negative .",
    "let us , however , consider a general geometry of radiatively  driven disc ",
    "wind models in some more detail .",
    "the wind is expected to initially rise vertically at @xmath188 with velocity @xmath189 . as shown by risaliti & elvis ( 2010 ) and nomura et al .",
    "( 2013 ) based on non  hydrodynamical models , the wind likely comprises three main zones : an inner failed wind which is too ionized ( or too dense in the nomura et al 2013 study ) to be efficiently radiatively accelerated ; a middle zone ( typically with launching radii of the order of hundreds of @xmath190 ) where ionisation is relatively low so that the gas is efficiently radiatively accelerated up to escape velocity ; an outer zone where the local disc luminosity and the uv irradiation from the innermost regions are weak , so that the wind never reaches escape velocity and fails ( or it is not even launched vertically ) .",
    "according to this simple geometry , the inner zone represents the so  called shielding gas ( e.g. murray et al . 1995 ) which reduces the ionisation of the outer zones ; the middle zone gives rise to the actual disc wind , which is observationally identified with the broad , blueshifted high  ionisation  emission ",
    "lines ( hiel ) such as e.g. c  iv , and with the corresponding absorption ",
    "lines whenever our line  of  sight ( los ) crosses the wind itself as in narrow / broad  absorption  lines agn . on the other hand ,",
    "the outermost failed wind may be responsible for some of the lower  ionisation broad emission lines ( e.g. the blamer lines as well as mg  ii ) which are generally symmetric and centred at rest  frame wavelength . the observational evidence that the low  ionisation  emission ",
    "lines ( liel ) see a continuum that has been filtered through the wind ( e.g. leighly 2004 ; leighly & moore 2004 ) provides further support to this geometry for the blr , which is often referred to as _ the wind  disc geometry of the blr _ , to differentiate the two main blr regions , of which one is dominated by outflows , the other by gravity ( e.g. richards et al . 2011 and references therein ) .    as our aat observation only could target the liel",
    ", we are here concerned with the so  called disc  component of the blr only . in order for the gas to produce the liel , substantial euv and soft x ",
    "rays irradiation is required .",
    "however , all disc wind models ( e.g. risaliti & elvis 2010 , nomura et al . 2013 ) and simulations ( e.g. proga & kallmann 2004 ; see also subsequent work by schurch & done 2009 and by sim et al .",
    "2010 ) demonstrate that soft x - rays and euv irradiation is weak close to the disc plane at relatively large radii because of absorption and compton scattering in the inner wind / shield , and because of the angular dependence of the disc emission itself . in fact , one can qualitatively infer that zones within @xmath191 from the disc plane are unlikely to be efficiently irradiated .",
    "hence , any wind ( either accelerated or failed ) has to initially rise vertically to a height @xmath192 in order to be exposed to sufficient irradiation to produce the liel .",
    "the rising time is obviously @xmath193 , where @xmath189 is the vertical rising velocity .",
    "we can then estimate the minimum launching radius @xmath194 that is consistent with the observationally  derived minimum liel ",
    "blr formation timescale of @xmath186  yr for gsn  069 .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , that @xmath195  km  s@xmath16 at all radii ( risaliti & elvis 2010 ) , @xmath196  @xmath197 .",
    "if the wind is launched from @xmath198 the liel  blr formation timescale is longer than @xmath186  yr and thus consistent with the gsn  069 data .",
    "it is interesting to compare this value with the blr radius , as derived from the blr size  luminosity relation ( e.g. kaspi et al .",
    "2005 ; bentz et al .",
    "2006 ) which suggests @xmath199  cm in gsn  069 .",
    "reassuringly , @xmath200 is significantly larger than @xmath194 .",
    "we point out here that @xmath201 is much larger than the typical radius where disc winds can be launched vertically due to the local radiation pressure ( see e.g. nomura et al .",
    "moreover , any disc wind launched and accelerated within @xmath202 to escape velocity , would reach @xmath200 in less than a year , thus predicting much shorter liel  blr formation timescales than observed ( @xmath203  yr ) .",
    "we can conclude that the liel are not formed directly in the standard disc wind launched at hundreds of @xmath190 from the central black hole .",
    "our results are instead consistent with the idea proposed by czerny & hryniewicz ( 2011 ) in which the liel  blr originate in a dust  driven  outflow launched off the disc between the radius @xmath204 where the local temperature is @xmath205  k ( i.e. dust can survive within the disc ) , and the dust sublimation radius @xmath206 .",
    "czerny & hryniewicz ( 2011 ) show that @xmath207 in objects where @xmath200 has been measured via reverberation  mapping , so that their idea has a sound observational basis .",
    "the presence of dust in this range of radii boosts the effect of radiation pressure with respect to the case of a dust  free gas , and contributes to drive a massive vertical outflow off the disc .",
    "when the gas reaches sufficiently high elevation to be irradiated , it looses any dust content and the outflow fails ( as at these large radii irradiation is not strong enough to drive a radial wind , see e.g. risaliti & elvis 2010 ) .",
    "such dynamics , comprising rising and falling clumps , provides a turbulent medium dominated by keplerian motion , an elegant description of what the liel ",
    "blr may indeed look like .",
    "moreover , the outer parts of the dust  driven ",
    "wind beyond the dust sublimation radius may give rise to the so  called obscuring torus which is likely outflowing due to the radiation pressure on the dust grains , linking the blr and the torus structures via a unique dust  driven  outflow .    within this model , a dust  driven",
    " wind rising vertically from @xmath208 with velocity @xmath209  km  s@xmath16 would be irradiated after @xmath210  yr in gsn  069 , hence the liel will start to form within about 20 years of the re  activation of gsn  069 .",
    "however , for the liel lines to be detected , the irradiated gas needs to reach a substantial filling factor .",
    "assuming that a standard blr comprises the whole region between @xmath204 and @xmath211 , a fully mature liel  blr in gsn  069 may take a few hundreds of years to develop , although weak liel may start to be visible a few tens of years after the re  activation .",
    "as discussed above , the lack of broad liel in gsn  069 is consistent with an outflow origin , provided that the wind is launched further away than @xmath196 , possibly indicating a dust  driven  wind origin for the disc component of the blr , as suggested by czerny & hryniewicz ( 2011 ) .",
    "however , an inner disc ",
    "wind should have been launched in gsn  069 already , giving rise to potentially observable broad and blueshifted hiel such as e.g. c  iv .",
    "future spectroscopic uv observations of gsn  069 may then reveal the presence of such a wind component which , being launched from smaller radii , is already exposed to uv irradiation and should reveal itself as a hiel  emitter .",
    "observations targeting simultaneously both the wind ( c  iv ) and the disc ( mg  ii ) component of the blr may therefore be crucial for our understanding of the overall ( wind and disc ) blr formation mechanisms and timescales . a simple sketch of the envisaged geometry of the system within the disc  wind ( and dust  driven wind ) scenario is presented in fig .  [ blrgeometry ]",
    "gsn  069 can be classified as a seyfert  2 galaxy in the optical . the lack of cold x  ray absorption as well as the soft x ",
    "rays short timescale variability rule out a standard seyfert  2 galaxy interpretation of the x  ray data , suggesting that gsn  069 is a true seyfert  2 galaxy candidate which lacks the blr ( or has very weak lines ) .",
    "the source is undetected above 1  kev , suggesting a particularly weak ( or absent ) optically thin standard x  ray corona resulting in a very large 210  kev bolometric correction @xmath212 .",
    "the x  ray spectrum is affected by warm absorption and it is significantly softer than the typical agn soft excess .",
    "it can be described by pure ad thermal emission suggesting a black hole mass of @xmath115 and eddington ratio @xmath213 ( @xmath214  erg  s@xmath16 ) .",
    "the historical bolometric luminosity , as traced by the nlr emitting gas , is instead @xmath215  erg  s@xmath16 , thus corresponding to a historical eddington ratio of @xmath216 .",
    "although spectro ",
    "polarimetric observations would be needed to exclude the presence of a hblr , gsn  069 appears to be a puzzling true seyfert  2 galaxy candidate with higher  than  critical eddington ratio for the blr disappearance ( i.e. for the disc wind disappearance according to nicastro et al .",
    "2000 ; trump et al .",
    "we propose two possible scenarios that can explain our observations .    in the first scenario ,",
    "the lack of optical broad lines in gsn  069 is directly linked with the lack of hard x  rays .",
    "this is because , if the blr consists of relatively cold clouds in pressure equilibrium with a much hotter inter ",
    "cloud medium , the lack of hard x  ray emission implies a dramatic drop of the compton temperature of the gas , destroying the two  phase stability regime of the cloud / inter  cloud medium , hence , although the euv and soft x ",
    "rays luminosity is high enough to produce the optical emission lines , the extreme hard  x  ray weakness of gsn  069 prevents the blr from reaching the necessary two  phase equilibrium , leading to the suppression of the line  emitting region thermodynamically .",
    "such idea may be tested by following the evolution ( if any ) of the hard x  ray emission in gsn  069 and similar objects ( e.g.2xmm  j123103.2 + 110648 which has similar properties and also lacks hard x  ray emission ) .",
    "the detection of sources with a standard level of hard x  ray emission but with no blr would challenge the idea of a two  phase component for the blr , and would imply that this interpretation is unlikely to be viable in gsn  069 .",
    "bianchi et al . (",
    "2012 ) point out the existence of two such candidates ( mrk  273x and 1es  1927 + 654 ) which are surely worth further study .    in the second scenario ,",
    "gsn  069 has recently experienced a transition from a relatively radiatively inefficient state ( @xmath217 ) to a highly efficient one ( @xmath218 , likely already in place during the 2007 _ galex _ observation ) .",
    "a disc  wind has then formed recently following this re  activation , and its signature may be revealed by looking for broad and blueshifted hiel ( e.g. c  iv ) in future uv spectroscopic observations . as for the liel ,",
    "our data can be used to infer a minimum liel",
    " blr formation timescale of @xmath1  3  yr which is consistent with the idea of a dust  driven  wind launched at @xmath219  cm ( consistent with the estimated @xmath220  cm ) .",
    "the dust  driven outflow is then still in its rising phase , so that no liel are formed yet .",
    "the lines form when the dusty  wind begins to be irradiated ( a few tens of years after it has been launched ) , although it will take about one order of magnitude more time to form a fully mature liel  blr filling the entire blr region out to the dust sublimation radius . on the other hand ,",
    "our results seem to rule out that the liel are part of a standard disc  wind launched at few hundreds of @xmath190 , as the wind",
    "would already have reached the blr typical location producing broad optical lines , in contrast with the minimum @xmath221  yr timescale we derive observationally . within the latter ,",
    "outflow  based scenario , the lack of hard x  ray emission in gsn  069 ( and 2xmm  j123103.2 + 110648 ) could be associated with a very early phase in the transition from a radiatively inefficient to an efficient flow .",
    "it is possible that an inner failed wind is present at this evolutionary stage , quenching the formation of a standard x  ray corona which may settle down into its optically  thin configuration later on ( e.g. proga 2005 ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the model of episodic blr formation proposed by wang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in the context of star  forming , self  gravitating discs in agn predicts the existence of a ( rare ) population of so  called panda agn that should exhibit relatively high eddington ratio with no blr signatures during the early stages of the blr formation . although the lifetime of such a phase may be very short in gsn  069 ( primarily due to the low black hole mass ) , it is interesting to note that gsn  069 may represent one panda agn candidate , to be confirmed with future spectro  polarimetric , as well as uv spectroscopic observations .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that gsn  069 ( and 2xmm  j123103.2 + 110648 ) may represent ( one of ) the long  sought missing links between black hole x  ray binaries and supermassive accreting black holes .",
    "indeed , the properties of gsn  069 suggest that this agn is currently in a super  soft state , similar to that experienced by some black hole x  ray transients during their outburst evolution , when the emission is completely dominated by the ad thermal emission , and the hard x  ray contribution to the bolometric luminosity is negligible .",
    "gsn  069 was here detected and classified properly only thanks to its small black hole mass and high eddington ratio , which shifts the ad thermal emission up to the soft x  rays .",
    "agn powered by larger black holes and/or accreting at lower rates would not have been detected in the soft x ",
    "rays at all .",
    "it is then possible that there is an entire population of agn with more typical ( larger ) black hole mass in super ",
    "soft states that are completely missed in current x  ray surveys .",
    "a gsn  069like object with larger black hole mass would in fact be likely classified as a compton ",
    "thick candidate . assuming typical eddington ratio @xmath170 ( and non  rotating black holes ) , no soft x",
    " rays are expected from the ad thermal emission for @xmath222 at redshift zero , so that almost all gsn  069like agn would be mis  classified as compton  thick type  2 candidates in even moderately high redshift surveys .",
    "if the population of gsn  069like objects with typical @xmath5 black hole mass is not negligible , these sources may then contaminate the fraction of heavily obscured agn in the universe as derived from current x  ray surveys .",
    "moreover , if the analogy with black hole binaries holds , the life ",
    "time of super  soft states in agn could be as long as @xmath223  yr , i.e. orders of magnitude longer than the time x  ray observatories have existed . as such , we can not exclude that the fraction of gsn  069like , super  soft agn is not negligible in the universe .",
    "future studies will be devoted to assess the relevance of gsn  069like objects for the overall agn population .",
