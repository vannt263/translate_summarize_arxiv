    "in the lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath10cdm ) paradigm , small fluctuations in the primordial density field grow through gravitational instability and merge to form more massive structures . in this scenario ,",
    "small haloes in general form first and become the seeds for larger haloes ; galaxies form at the centres of these dark matter haloes , as the baryons collapse , cool and form stars ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "therefore the formation and evolution of galaxies depends critically on the properties of dark matter haloes ( e.g. , eke et al . 2004 ; baugh 2006 ) .",
    "in addition , the spatial distribution of galaxies must be related to that of the underlying dark matter haloes .    in this context",
    ", the measurement of the clustering of galaxies makes it possible to link galaxy properties with halo properties , since the clustering of galaxies is determined by the clustering of their host haloes , with more massive haloes showing higher clustering amplitudes than lower mass haloes ( e.g. , mo & white 1996 ) .",
    "the most popular methods linking them are the two - point correlation function of galaxies ( peebles 1980 ) and the halo model with the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) framework ( jing , mo & boerner 1998 ; benson et al . 2000 ; ma & fry 2000 ; peacock & smith 2000 ; seljak 2000 ; scoccimarro et al . 2001 ; berlind & weinberg 2002 ; for a review see cooray & sheth 2002 ) .",
    "the two - point correlation function describes the excess probability over random of the existence of a galaxy pair at a specific separation .",
    "the hod quantifies the probability that a certain type of galaxy is hosted by a halo of a given mass .",
    "given a cosmology and the hod , the galaxy correlation function can be generated .",
    "recently , wide area surveys have provided an opportunity to measure the clustering of different galaxies accurately . from optical imaging and spectroscopic surveys , the correlation function of low redshift galaxies selected by their",

    "is difficult since the bulk of their stellar emission is redshifted to ir wavelengths .",
    "thus a near - ir dataset is required to select red , passive galaxies at @xmath12 .",
    "there are several colour criteria known to be successful at selecting galaxies at @xmath12 .",
    "firstly , extremely red objects ( eros , elston , rieke & rieke 1988 ) can be selected by their red optical / near - ir colour ( e.g. @xmath13 ) .",
    "this selection is efficient in detecting massive galaxies , @xmath14 , at @xmath12 ( conselice et al .",
    "moreover , it is known that eros are strongly clustered ( daddi et al .",
    "2000 ; roche et al . 2002 , 2003 ; brown et al .",

    "2011a ) and so are expected to reside in massive dark matter haloes ( moustakas & somerville 2002 ; gonzalez - perez et al .",
    "2009 ; palamara et al .",
    "however , eros selected with a simple colour cut are contaminated by dusty , star - forming galaxies ( pozzetti & mannucci 2000 ; smail et al . 2002 ; roche et al . 2002 ; cimatti et al . 2002 , 2003 ; moustakas et al .",
    "2004 ; sawicki et al . 2005 ; simpson et al . 2006 ; conselice et al . 2008 ; kong et al .",
    "alternatively , a red near - ir colour , @xmath15 , is useful to select distant red galaxies ( drgs ) which are predominantly intrinsically red galaxies at @xmath16 ( franx et al .",
    "2003 ) . like eros ,",
    "drgs are also strongly clustered ( grazian et al .",

    "( 2008 ) for drgs and kim et al .",
    "( 2011a ) for eros showed that their angular correlation functions can not be described by a single power - law .",
    "this means that the correlation functions of both populations can be separated into the contributions from the one - halo term ( the clustering of objects in the same halo ) and the two - halo term ( the clustering of galaxies in different haloes ) .",
    "another intermediate redshift selection successfully defined by optical / near - ir colours is the @xmath17 selection ( daddi et al .",
    "this population can be easily split into star - forming ( @xmath18 ) and passive ( @xmath19 ) galaxies at @xmath20 , and are also strongly clustered ( kong et al . 2006 ; hartley et al . 2008 ; mccracken et al .",
    "2010 ; merson et al .",
    "2013 ) .    despite the successful colour criteria for selecting high redshift galaxies , previous measurements of the correlation function have suffered from the small areas surveyed .",
    "in particular , the lack of wide - field near - ir imaging data has prevented the detection of sufficiently large samples of high redshift galaxies . however ,",

    "in addition the virial mass ( @xmath135 ) is defined as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the mean comoving background density . to generate @xmath133 we used the ` camb ' software package ( lewis , challinor & lasenby 2000 ) including the fitting formulae of smith et al .",

    "gonzalez - perez et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) looked at the predictions of a different semi - analytical model , that of font et  al .",
    "the font et  al .",
    "model includes partial stripping of the hot gas halo from satellite galaxies , whereas the default assumption is that all of the hot gas is stripped from a galaxy once it becomes a satellite within a larger halo . in the font",
    "model , depending on the orbit of the satellite and the ram pressure that it experiences , some hot gas may be retained and can cool onto the galaxy even after it has become a satellite .",
    "this change to the model makes satellites bluer , by permitting more star formation to take place .",
    "however , font et  al . also invoked a factor of two increase in the stellar yield without changing the imf , which leads to redder galaxy colours .",
    "gonzalez - perez et  al .",
    "report that the font et al model produces stronger clustering for eros than the model of bower et  al . but also leads to more eros than are observed .    additionally , gonzalez - perez et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) mentioned that the bower et al .",
    "( 2006 ) model quenched the star formation of massive galaxies too efficiently by the agn feedback , based on the predicted redshift distribution of passive galaxies .",
    "zheng et al .",
    "( 2009 ) also pointed out that this model predicts more red galaxies in a few times @xmath152 haloes than observations but less in more massive haloes , comparing the hods of observed and predicted lrgs",
    ". therefore it may be possible that galform predicts more red central galaxies such as eros and lrgs in lower mass haloes .",
    "these comparison illustrate the potential of our new clustering results to constrain the modeling of different elements of the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "recently wide and deep near - ir surveys have made it possible to select @xmath12 galaxies effectively . in this study",
    "we have used a near - ir dataset from the ukidss dxs and optical datasets from pan - starrs ps1 and subaru to investigate the clustering of eros and the halo properties hosting them .",
    "the main results can be summarised as follows ;    1 .",
    "@xmath71 colour cuts were applied to extract eros from the 3.88 deg@xmath0 dxs / subaru and the 5.33 deg@xmath0 dxs / ps1 catalogues , respectively .",
    "we detected 17250 eros from dxs / ps1 and 23916 eros from dxs / subaru .",
    "the number counts of eros agree well with previous studies .",
    "the photometric redshifts of galaxies in dxs / ps1 were measured from @xmath153 and swire irac colours .",
    "these eros were split into subsamples of different photometric redshift and brighter than a fixed absolute magnitude ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "the angular correlation functions of eros were measured with several colour and magnitude thresholds from the dxs / subaru sample .",
    "all these correlation functions showed a clear break at @xmath3 which implies that the angular correlation function of eros can not be described by a single power - law .",
    "furthermore , redder or brighter eros showed higher amplitudes than bluer or fainter ones .",
    "the correlation functions from the dxs / ps1 and the dxs / subaru samples with the same criteria also showed good agreement .",
    "the correlation functions at different redshifts had similar amplitudes on large scales , indicating a higher bias at higher redshift .",
    "a standard halo model was fitted to the observed angular correlation of eros and matches well .",
    "the biases for eros range between 2.7 and 3.5 , and the average dark matter halo mass hosting eros is over @xmath6 .",
    "eros at higher redshifts are more biased and located in slightly less massive dark matter haloes than at lower redshift .",
    "also the ero satellite fraction decreases with increasing redshift .",
    "the different fraction of old , passive eros at different redshifts may affect the properties .",
    "in addition , the overall halo properties for eros are consistent with @xmath9 galaxies .",
    "the predicted angular correlation function of eros from the galform semi - analytic model showed good agreement with the observed correlation function . comparing the halo model for observed eros to the galform predictions",
    ", we found that the eros predicted by galform present too high a fraction of satellite galaxies or too many galaxies in less massive haloes .",
    "finally , we stress that the results from the hod frame work must be interpreted with care due to the effect of agn feedback and that additional refinements are necessary in future semi - analytical models to improve the modelling of the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "our clustering results are derived from the large solid angle survey currently available .",
    "nevertheless , the effects of cosmic variance dominate at large scales , so substantial improvements could be obtained in the measurements from even larger surveys . in the near future , the completed ukidss and vista surveys will be important for making further progress on studying galaxy evolution at @xmath12 .",
    "moreover the combination of near - ir surveys and improved optical surveys such as pan - starrs , hyper suprime camera on subaru and lsst will have a dramatic impact .",

    "<S> this suggests that the treatment of gas cooling may need to be revised in the model . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis illustrates the potential of clustering analyses to provide observational constraints on theoretical models of galaxy formation .    </S>",
