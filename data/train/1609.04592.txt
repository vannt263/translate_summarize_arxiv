    "during the course of its 16-year mission , the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) detected far more photons ( 30 billion in pcu-2 alone ) from accreting black holes than any other x - ray observatory .",
    "the sample of black holes ( bhs ) targeted by _",

    "while the total galactic population of stellar bhs is believed to be many millions , only a tiny subset of approximately 50 are known to us , namely those located in x - ray binaries .",
    "a wondrous property of bhs , their utter simplicity , is the essence of the famous no - hair theorem : each bh in nature is fully described by just its mass and spin .",
    "roughly half of the known stellar bhs have a dynamically - determined mass .",
    "the measured masses range from @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , estimates of spin have been obtained for many of them during the past decade , principally by modeling either the thermal continuum emission of the accretion disk ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , or the relativistically - broadened reflection spectrum ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    ", sweeping changes occur in many properties of the system including the composition of its spectrum , the intensity of fourier flicker noise , and the presence or absence of quasi - periodic oscillations and jets ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",

    "stellar bhs emit a complex multicomponent x - ray spectrum .",
    "thermal _ blackbody - like component is produced in the very inner accretion disk .",
    "the disk is truncated at a radius @xmath2 before reaching the event horizon .",
    "a hard _ power - law _ component results from compton scattering of the thermal disk photons in hot coronal gas that veils the disk .",
    "the third principal component is a _ reflection _ spectrum generated by illumination of the cold disk ( @xmath3kev ) by the power - law component .",
    "the reflection component is a rich mix of radiative recombination continua , absorption edges and fluorescent lines @xcite .",
    "an analysis of these three interacting spectral components provides constraints on the source properties including geometry ( e.g. , on @xmath2 and the scale of the corona ) .",
    "the relationships between these components across the full range of behavior displayed by accreting stellar bhs is the focus of this paper .",
    "our results are based on an analysis for 29 stellar bhs ( 10 dynamically - confirmed bhs and 19 bh candidates ) of all the data collected using _ rxte _ s prime detector unit ( pcu-2 ) , some 15,000 spectra in all , with a total net exposure time of 30ms .",
    "importantly , we recalibrate the data using our tool pcacorr , which greatly reduces the level of systematic error @xcite . given the scope of our study , relativistic reflection models are too complex and computationally slow for our purposes ( e.g. ; reflionx , xillver , relxill ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore employ a simplistic , phenomenological model and estimate the strength of the reflection spectrum by determining the equivalent width with respect to the compton continuum of its most prominent reflection feature , namely the @xmath4  kev fe - k line .",

    "the _ rxte _  archive provides the premier database for the synoptic study of stellar bhs .",
    "we exclusively use the data collected by pcu-2 , one of the five proportional counter detectors that comprise _ rxte _ s principal instrument , the proportional counter array ( pca ) . throughout the mission , pcu-2 was the unit that was most often active , and it had the most reliable and stable calibration @xcite .",
    "its area and energy resolution were 1300@xmath6 and @xmath7% at 6 kev .",
    "table  1 summarizes our data sample . during an outburst ,",
    "a bh was typically observed daily over a period of months as it systematically brightened and subsequently dimmed by orders of magnitude .",
    "we homogenized the data by segmenting it into continuous 3005000s intervals , each of which was used to produce an energy spectrum and a power - density spectrum ( pds ) .",
    "energy spectra were analyzed ignoring the lowest 4 channels , an effective lower bound @xmath8 kev , and an upper bound of 45kev was adopted .",
    "the effects of detector dead time were corrected as described in @xcite .",
    "we obtained an absolute calibration of the flux using the the standard @xcite spectrum of the crab nebula ; our slope and normalization corrections are @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we computed the rms power , a measure of the flicker noise , by integrating the pds over the band 0.110hz . an unprecedented sensitivity to faint spectral features",
    "is achieved by employing the calibration tool pcacorr @xcite , which improves the quality of the pca s spectral calibration by roughly an order of magnitude and results in a data precision of @xmath11 .",
    "we include this small systematic uncertainty as a fractional error on each channel when conducting our analysis using xspec @xcite .",
    "the considerable increase in sensitivity pcacorr delivers is crucial for estimating the strength of line features .",
    "all pcu-2 data for 29 black holes are plotted in a hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) @xcite in the top panel of figure  [ fig : qdiag ] .",
    "the normalized hard color ( or hardness ratio @xmath12 ) is the ratio of count rates in the energy bands indicated in the upper panel , and is described in @xcite . the data are color - coded to show the level of rms flicker noise . as is well - known and is evident here from the vertical striation , rms noise correlates with spectral state ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with hard states showing several - times stronger rms than soft states .",
    "the six small panels are hids for selected sources .",

    "the other selected source showing stunted hid evolution is grs  1915 + 105 , which is an unusual transient system that has been in a protracted state of outburst since 1992 .",
    "we adopt a single simplistic spectral model that is applicable to both soft and hard spectra : phabs*[smedge(simpl@xmath13diskbb)+gauss ] .",
    "the disk and compton components are modeled by diskbb @xcite , and simpl @xcite , respectively .",
    "the reflection component is described by a gaussian line with fixed energy of 6.5kev and an intrinsic width of 50ev .",
    "we note that owing to the broad detector resolution at the fe line @xmath14  kev , the value adopted for the line width in our simplistic model is of minor consequence ( as demonstrated in section  [ section : disc ] ) . despite its coarse resolution , _ rxte _",
    "is very sensitive to the line flux , as measured by the normalization of the gaussian feature .",
    "accordingly , we adopt the line flux as our proxy for the intensity of the reflection component .",
    "we approximate the relativistically - broadened fe - k absorption edge using smedge @xcite ; we fit for the peak depth @xmath15 with the width fixed at 7kev and the shape index set to -2.67 @xcite .",
    "our adopted values of the column density @xmath16 are summarized in table1 .",
    "error bars are shown in the upper - left corner in each panel . ]",
    "we have fitted all @xmath17 spectra with our model . in figure",
    "[ fig : ew ] , results are shown for approximately one - quarter of these spectra , those that meet three criteria : @xmath18 ; fe - line normalization significant at the @xmath19 level ; and power - law normalization @xmath20 significant at the @xmath21 level . plotted in the top panel is gaussian line flux versus the compton power law flux near the fe edge computed by integrating the power - law component from 78kev . since the fluorescent fek line is produced preferentially by photons at energies above and near the fek edge @xcite , i.e. , at energies @xmath22kev @xcite , it is not surprising that the line and continuum fluxes are strongly correlated .",
    "though notably , this strong correlation is a direct validation of the reflection paradigm ( wherein power - law emission fluoresces strong line emission ) .",
    "what is surprising is that the soft states ( red ) appear to be much more efficient at producing reflection than hard states ( blue ) , as evidenced by the vertical offset between the clouds of soft and hard data .",
    "this result runs counter to the conventional view that reflection is weak in soft states ( e.g. , @xcite , but see the correlation between spectral index and reflection strength in @xcite , and related work ) , a view based on the weakness of reflection _ relative to the thermal disk component_. here instead , we appropriately relate the strength of the reflection signal to the power - law component that produces it , as isolated from the evolving thermal disk . in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : ew ] , we plot ( versus the hardness ratio @xmath12 ) our proxy for the strength of reflection : i.e. , we plot the equivalent width ( @xmath23 ) of the line with respect to the coronal flux .",
    "that reflection is more pronounced for soft states is readily apparent . in soft states ,",
    "@xmath23 decreases regularly by an order of magnitude as the spectrum hardens ; then , for intermediate and hard states it plateaus at @xmath24 . given the inhomogeneity of our data sample , which includes both transient and persistent sources , the ordered quality of these data is striking .",

    "j1550 was discovered on 1998 september 6 , and two weeks later it reached a peak intensity of 6.8crab ( 210kev ) .",
    "four additional fainter outbursts were observed during the following decade .",
    "we define @xmath25 as the cut between soft and hard - state data , and we again ( as in figure  [ fig : ew ] ) examine the relationship between our proxy for reflection ( namely the flux in the fe k line ) and the flux in the adjacent compton continuum .",
    "the data are plotted in figure  [ fig : j1550 ] .",
    "we begin with a simplistic assumption that the coronal flux and fe line flux will scale together , i.e. , @xmath26 , and we proceed to fit for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this _ scaling relation _ is termed sr - pl to emphasize that the line flux scales with the power law .",
    "we likewise pursue the sr - pl fit for hard spectra ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) , with the constants of soft and hard data determined independently .",
    "for the soft data , we additionally investigate the possibility that disk self - irradiation may also contribute to the reflection emission .",
    "this is a motivated notion given that bright soft - states can produce appreciable thermal emission even above 5  kev , and further , some fraction of the thermal photons ( the `` returning radiation '' ) is bent back and strikes the disk rather than escaping to infinity .",
    "we consider returning radiation by allowing for an added scaling with the disk s emission in the same 78 kev band proximate to the fe - k edge , i.e. , @xmath30 ( this is the sr - pl&d scaling relation ) , and we likewise fit for its parameters .    in the top panel of figure  [ fig : j1550 ] , we show the compton component s contribution to the fe - line flux for both the sr - pl ( red ) and sr - pl&d ( green ) fits . the contribution to the line flux from returning radiation is vanishingly small , particularly at the highest luminosities . in the same figure ,",
    "for reference we also show the sr - pl fit to the hard data in blue .",

    "having established that the effects of returning radiation are minor , we focus on comparing reflection for soft and hard data using solely the sr - pl curves .",
    "we produce markov - chain monte carlo realizations for both the hard and soft sr - pl correlations ( top panel , figure  [ fig : j1550 ] ) , and we compare their respective fe - line fluxes . the results are shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : j1550 ] . on average ,",

    "our default curve is presented in orange with its associated 95% confidence intervals as a light - shaded region .",
    "results for alternate spectral models with different values of the gaussian line energy and line width , which produce modest systematic differences , are also shown for comparison . ]",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : j1550 ] , our estimate of the ratio of the fe - line flux in soft and hard states is only modestly sensitive to the values we adopted for the line energy ( 6.5kev ) and width ( 50ev ) .",
    "varying these values does not affect our conclusions .",
    "we have also explored other model formulations ( e.g. , including a power - law cutoff and replacing the gaussian by a relativistic line profile ) and have similarly found that our conclusions are unaffected .",
    "varying the line shape systematically rescales the line flux , but it has a minor affect on the ratio of the fluxes in soft and hard states , which is our focus .",
    "consideration of two shortcomings of our simplistic model serve to strengthen our conclusion that soft states are more efficient in producing reflection emission .",
    "first , soft - state disks are hotter and more strongly ionized , and hence they generally produce more reflection continuum emission , which gets lumped together with the compton power law . in the case of our simple model , this effect serves to boost the power - law continuum , thereby reducing @xmath23 for the soft state .",
    "secondly , fe - line absorption features in disk winds are preferentially and often observed in soft states @xcite , and these absorption features act to weaken the emission line .",
    "our finding of enhanced @xmath23 in soft states is thus contrary to these biases .",
    "earlier work by @xcite which examined the effect of comptonizing reflection spectra showed that at a fixed value of @xmath42 , the fitted fe - k equivalent width is very sensitive to the coronal temperature @xmath43 , principally because as @xmath43 decreases , optical depth @xmath44 necessarily increases ( a straightforward consequence of the equations governing thermal comptonization ) .",
    "accordingly , at high optical depth , the line is highly scattered in the corona .",
    "the scattered portion blends with the continuum , which results in a decrease in the gaussian s equivalent width .",
    "we have examined the evolution of equivalent width versus spectral hardness ( changing @xmath42 ) and other spectral parameters .",
    "there is a strong anti - correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath23 in precisely the sense predicted by @xcite , and is the most apparent explanation for the observed trend .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : fsc ] .    alternatively , or in addition to the dilution of the line by compton scattering in the corona",
    ", changes in the disk - coronal geometry can impact the reflection s strength .",
    "in particular , a corona at very small scale - height ( @xmath45 ) coupled with a close - in disk yields a higher reflection fraction than when either ( 1 ) the disk is truncated or ( 2 ) the corona is very large compared to the event horizon @xcite .",
    "gradual evolution of accretion flow with more compact disk - coronal geometry ( i.e. , lower @xmath46 ) in soft states would similarly contribute to the observed correlation .",
    "we caution that the role of ionization is complex and varies nonlinearly as other coronal attributes change , including most notably , @xmath42 .",
    "these differences are principally related to changes in the atmosphere s temperature structure . for",
    "the range of ionization parameters observed around active stellar - mass bhs , i.e. , log  @xmath47 , we simulated pcu-2 data using the xillver  reflection model @xcite , and applied our analysis method .",
    "we found that @xmath23 varies by a factor of @xmath48 over the span of @xmath42 ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 ; this is insufficient to account for the full trend in figure  [ fig : ew ] .",
    "moreover , for log  @xmath51 , higher @xmath42 tends to produce lower @xmath23 whereas at log  @xmath52 , the trend reverses .    as summarized by @xcite , and also @xcite",
    ", there is abundant evidence for a strong positive correlation between spectral index and reflection strength ( the  @xmath53 \" correlation ) .",
    "this has been seen in both bh x - ray binaries and in agn .",
    "however , such work has been largely confined to examination of hard states . to our knowledge",
    ", our work is the first compelling evidence that the correlation between spectral softness ( increasing @xmath42 ) and reflection fraction continues and is strongly amplified in soft , thermal states ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) .",
    "further , from considering the _ rxte _  archive of active bhs , as is readily apparent in figure  [ fig : ew ] , this change is gradual and orderly amongst the full cast of stellar bhs .",
    "we have examined the strength of reflection in a global study of stellar bhs using a simplistic , phenomenological spectral model .",
    "we directly validate the reflection paradigm , wherein power - law flux induces reflection emission . in separating possible contribution from disk self - irradiation ,",
    "we demonstrate that the power law s contribution is dominant .",
    "most importantly , we show that the corona produces reflection features up to an order of magnitude more pronounced in soft rather than hard states .",
    "the data suggest an ordered transition in which the line - to - continuum strength declines gradually with spectral hardness .",
    "this is the first time the `` @xmath53 '' correlation has been shown to extend through ( and increase in ) bh soft states .",
    "one possible explanation is that a more compact disk - coronal geometry in soft states would produce the observed trend .",
    "however , the most natural explanation for this trend is suggested by @xcite , who describe the dilution of line features emitted by the disk due to compton - scattering in the corona . in our case , because hard states have corona with higher optical depth than soft states , their line features are correspondingly weakened resulting in the observed anti - correlation between @xmath12 and reflection strength ."
