    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are spherical stellar systems in which stars are tightly bound by gravity .",
    "they are the oldest and also the most dense stellar systems in the galaxy . on average",
    "the stellar density is @xmath1 0.4 star per cubic parsec , increasing to 100 or 1000 stars per cubic parsec in their cores .",
    "the dynamical interactions with high stellar encounter rate are expected to form low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "the formation rate per unit mass of lmxbs in gcs is known to be greater than in other places of the galaxy @xcite and millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are generally believed to be the descendants of lmxbs @xcite .",
    "it is also widely accepted that msps contribute almost all @xmath0-ray emissions of gcs . before 2008 no gcs had been known as @xmath0-ray emitter .",
    "the situation changed dramatically after the successful launch of _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope @xcite since the _ large area telescope _ ( lat ) onboard the _ fermi _ satellite , a pair - production telescope , can detect @xmath0-rays at energies between @xmath1 20 mev and @xmath2 300 gev with unprecedent sensitivity .",
    "the discovery of @xmath0-ray emission from gcs was made in 47 tucanae ( ngc 104 ; abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) , in which at least 23 msps have been known by radio / x - ray observations . as suggested in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission from gcs is not due to single msp but all the msps as a population .",
    "more than 150 gcs have been identified in optical band @xcite , but most of them are not significant @xmath0-ray emitters . nine 2fgl sources are doubtless associated with gcs , including 47 tuc @xcite , omega cen ( ngc 5139 ) , ngc 6266 , ngc 6388 , terzan 5 , ngc 6440 , ngc 6626 , ngc 6652 @xcite and m 80 ( ngc  6093 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , there are a few candidates such as 2ms - gc01 and ic 1257 @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of significant @xmath0-ray emission from most gcs is likely due to their low luminosities of the gev emission and due to the strong background emission for the global clusters superposed in the galactic disk .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze the latest _ fermi _ lat data aiming to identify more @xmath0-ray emitters of gcs .",
    "this work is structured as the following . in section 2",
    "we present our data analysis .",
    "our results are introduced in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is our summary with some discussion .",
    "we use more than 6 years of _ fermi _ lat data ( pass 7 reprocessed data ; totally covering 2191 days from august 4th 2008 ) with energy ranges from 100 mev to 100 gev .",
    "the fermi science tools v9r33p0 package is used to analyze the data , which is available from the fermi science support center .",
    "the p7rep_source ( evclass=2 ) photons for point source analysis are selected in this work . to reduce the contribution from earth albedo @xmath0-rays , we only use events with zenith angles @xmath3 . the p7rep_source_v15 instrument response functions ( irfs )",
    "is used .",
    "we try an overall search of the gcs listed in the catalogue compiled by harries ( 1996 ) . in the analysis of each gc",
    ", photons from a 20@xmath4 @xmath5 20@xmath4 square region of interest ( roi ) are selected , and binned into spatial pixels of 0.1@xmath4 @xmath5 0.1@xmath4 .",
    "the first step is to apply standard binned maximum likelihood analysis using _",
    "gtlike_. we modelled the events with components of target source ( with coordinates given in the catalogue ) and backgrounds .",
    "the background components in this model are composed of all sources in the second _ fermi _ lat catalogue within the roi and diffuse components , including the galactic diffuse model ( gll_iem_v05_rev1.fit ) and isotropic background ( iso_source_v05_rev1.txt ) . as usual , a single power law ( pl ) is used to model the point source .",
    "we also apply an exponential cutoff power law ( ple ) for the @xmath0-ray gc candidates , in which radio pulsars have been detected . for both models , the prefactor and the spectral index",
    "are set free .",
    "additionally , the cut off energy is set free in ple model .",
    "we then choose the gcs with test statistic ( ts ) values greater than 25 for a further study .",
    "the ts is defined as ts = 2(@xmath60 ) , where @xmath70 is the logarithmic maximum likelihood value for a model without the source ( null hypothesis ) and @xmath71 for a model with additional source at a specified location . for those @xmath0-ray gc candidates with ts @xmath8 25 ,",
    "we created @xmath9 residual ts maps for them using the tool _ gttsmap_. the ts maps aiming to identify weaker sources are created by moving a putative point source through a grid of locations on the sky and maximizing _",
    "-log(likelihood ) _ at each grid point . in taking this step , the target source that corresponds to the gc",
    "is removed from the model .",
    "all point source parameters are fixed while the diffuse components are set free . to reduce the contamination from background emissions due to point spread function ( psf ) at lower energy band , different energy ranges for each gc",
    "are selected in ts map creation .    from the residual ts maps , we find ngc 5904 , ngc 6656 have evidences of @xmath0-ray emission within their tidal radii .",
    "meanwhile , there is a @xmath0-ray emission evidence from fsr 1735 ( see lower panel in fig .",
    "[ 3tsmaps ] ) , the separation between the best - fit position of emission and core of fsr 1735 is @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite reported other 2 associations with 2fgl sources in second catalogue : ic1257 ( 2fgl j1727.1 - 0704 ) and 2ms - gc01 ( 2fgl j1808.6 - 1950c ) .",
    "we also create ts maps for them .",
    "we then use _ gtfindsrc _ to search for the positions of these @xmath0-ray candidates .",
    "the significance from corresponding ts values follows the @xmath11 distribution with 2 degrees of freedom ( pl model ; 3 degrees for ple model ) . to avoid fake signal with a number of search positions , similar estimation of trial factor",
    "is involved @xcite .",
    "totally 35 gcs with ts @xmath2 25 are further analysed in this work , so @xmath12 . the number of bins , @xmath13 , is derived by dividing the averaged tidal radius area of all known gcs into 0.1@xmath4 @xmath5 0.1@xmath4 pixel , where the average tidal radius is @xmath14 .",

    "is also 3.4@xmath21 post - trial , so we consider pl model as the better one .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the _ fermi _ lat data of more than 150 gcs and detect or find some evidence of @xmath0-ray emission from 3 gcs , i.e. fsr 1735 , ngc 5904 and ngc 6656 .",
    "another two ( 2ms - gc01 and ic 1257 ) have been reported as @xmath0-ray emission candidates in @xcite , of which the associations of significant @xmath0-ray emission have been confirmed here . among the three new detected candidates ,",
    "the evidence of @xmath0-ray emission from fsr 1735 is very significant ( the post - trial significance is at a confidence level of @xmath72 ) .",
    "though the tidal radius of such a gc is unknown , the @xmath0-ray source found in our analysis just has an offset @xmath63 from the core of fsr 1735 , which is small enough to allow us to suggest an association with these two sources .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission signals from the other two gcs are weaker ( the confidence level is above @xmath73 but smaller than @xmath74 ) and more data is needed to firmly establish their @xmath0-ray emitter nature .",
    "_ fermi _ satellite continues to collect the @xmath0-ray data and more @xmath0-ray gcs are expected to be identified .",
    "nevertheless for the gcs within the galactic plane the prospect is not very promising due to the strong background that can minimize the @xmath0-ray signal effectively .",
    "more gcs may be detected in the future with a high angular resolution telescope dedicated to the sub - tev ( from @xmath75 mev to @xmath75 gev ) @xmath0-ray photon detection .",
    "for example , the proposed mission ",
    "pair - production gamma - ray unit \" aims to have an angular resolution a factor of @xmath76 better than the currently operating _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope in the sub - gev range ( wu et al .",
    "the high quality @xmath0-ray maps will significantly improve the identification of  point - like \" sources from extended and complicated diffuse @xmath0-ray background , which is thus very suitable to identify more @xmath0-ray gcs .",
    "as already mentioned in section 3 , no pulsars have been reliably identified in these gcs except ngc 5904 and ngc 6656 .",
    "the detection of @xmath0-ray emission in turn provides us the chance to estimate the number of millisecond pulsars that are believed to be the unique stable @xmath0-ray emitters in gcs .",
    "our approach is following abdo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and the number of msps in each gc is estimated using their eq.(1 ) . where @xmath77@xmath78@xmath79 = ( 1.8 @xmath19 0.7)@xmath510@xmath54 erg s@xmath50 is adopted as average spin - down power of pulsar , and the @xmath0-ray luminosity conversion efficiency is set to 0.08 .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ para_spec ] .",
    "for ngc 5904 and ngc 6656 , the estimated numbers of msps are more than that found currently , implying that in the future more powerful radio telescopes ( or arrays ) have very promising detection prospects as long as these msps also radiate non - ignorable amount of energy in radio bands .",
