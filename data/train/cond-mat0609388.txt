    "the study of the gel state of matter in colloidal systems is receiving significant attention in the last years@xcite . at the heart of this interest lies the hope that these studies will help understanding differences and similarities in the processes of formation of arrested states of matter at low packing fraction @xmath0 , and in particular the inter - relations between gels and glasses .",
    "a similarly ambitious additional goal is to provide a new route for understanding the intrinsic properties of the process of formation of physical gels in systems more complicated than colloids , as the case of gels formed by reversible cross - linking of polymeric chains@xcite and gelation in protein solutions@xcite .",
    "the full comprehension of both these aggregation processes are of extreme importance in the food industry , in the protein crystallization process and in the design of novel biomaterials@xcite .",
    "one of the key questions regards the interplay between the process of formation of a long - living network and the process of phase separation in colloid - rich and colloid - poor regions@xcite .",
    "indeed , the increase of the bond interaction strength ( relative to the thermal energy ) controls both the increase of the inter - particle bond lifetime ( and as a consequence the lifetime of the spanning network ) and the increase of the driving force of formation of locally dense packed states , which progressively favor nucleation of the `` liquid '' ( colloid - rich ) phase@xcite . as a result , the establishment of conditions such that a connected percolating structure able to sustain stress survives for times longer than the observation time is often preempted by phase separation . for spherical attractive interaction potentials",
    ", it has been found that phase separation is always dominant at low densities and arrested states at low packing fractions @xmath0 can be reached only in non - homogeneous state , whose morphology is determined by the phase separation process@xcite .    a possible mechanism to generate low packing fraction arrested states in the absence of phase separation has been recently proposed and supported by off - lattice simulations@xcite . it has been shown that the region in the @xmath1 plane in which a two - phase coexistence is thermodynamically preferred as compared to the homogeneous fluid state can be progressively reduced ( both in @xmath2 and @xmath0 ) by decreasing the maximum number of possible pair - wise bonded interactions . in an equivalent language , the reduction  at fixed interaction potential range  of the colloid surface allowing for inter - particle bonding progressively destabilize phase separation@xcite . according to these ideas , colloidal particles with a limited number of attractive spots are the best candidates for gel formation .",
    "interestingly enough , these ideas carry also to the case of protein solutions , where the character of the amino acids on the surface of the protein controls the strength and the directionality of the inter - protein interaction@xcite .    in this article , we present a lattice gas model , which we solve in the bragg - williams mean field approximation and in the bethe - peierls quasi - chemical approximation and which allow us to visualize in a clear way the relation between the limitation of the maximum number of interaction and the amplitude of the phase separated region in the @xmath2-@xmath0 phase diagram .",
    "we complement these calculations with monte carlo simulations of the liquid - gas phase coexistence , to assess the reliability of the mean field solutions .",
    "the reported results confirm that the reduction of the maximum number of interactions is indeed an efficient mechanism for generating thermodynamically stable states at extremely low temperatures .",
    "the system we consider is a nearest neighbor lattice gas , with occupancy variables @xmath3 at each node of a lattice with @xmath4 nearest neighbors .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system is written , in the usual form , as    @xmath5    but with the @xmath6 indicating that the sum is only over such bond configurations that have at each vertex a maximum of @xmath7 bonds .",
    "for the purposes of mean field theory , we can write this as    @xmath8    where the first sum @xmath9 runs over all lattice sites , and the second sum @xmath10 runs over all @xmath4 nearest neighbors of site @xmath9 , and with @xmath11    where @xmath7 denotes the maximum number of interactions , or valency , allowed for a particle at any site . when @xmath12 , one recovers the simple lattice gas . in the following ,",
    "we consider the behavior of the system when the parameter @xmath7 is varied between the limits @xmath13 ( when one has a non - interacting _",
    "paramagnetic _ lattice gas ) and @xmath12 ( when one has the simple nearest neighbor lattice gas ) .",
    "in order to perform the mean field calculation , we approximate the function @xmath14 as    @xmath15    which has the desired linear behavior for small @xmath16 and a constant value of @xmath7 at large @xmath16 .",
    "further , the mean field approximation amounts to writing @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the average occupancy , given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total number of sites . with this approximation , the thermodynamic potential @xmath21 in the grand canonical ensemble may be written as    @xmath22\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the chemical potential , @xmath2 is the temperature , @xmath24 is the boltzmann s constant and @xmath18 is the occupancy , given @xmath23 and @xmath2 , that minimizes @xmath21 . imposing the minimization condition ,    @xmath25    allows one to eliminate @xmath23 and write the thermodynamic potential @xmath21 in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath18 .",
    "further , since @xmath26 , ( where @xmath27 is the pressure , and the system volume for the lattice gas @xmath28 the number of sites ) one obtains in this way the equation of state of the system :    @xmath29    the condition for the critical point is given by    @xmath30    and    @xmath31    from these , one obtains the critical density and the critical temperature , which depend on the parameter @xmath32 and are plotted in fig .",
    "1 . from the figure ,",
    "it is clear that both the critical density and the critical temperature go to zero as the variable @xmath32 goes to zero .    .",
    "calculated for @xmath33 and @xmath34.,width=566 ]    we next calculate the spinodals that demarcate the region of instability in the ( @xmath35 ) and in the ( @xmath36 ) phase diagram which are shown in fig .",

    "as an improvement over the mean field approximation , we next consider the bethe - peierls approximation , which in the case of the simple lattice gas is equivalent to the bethe lattice . as in the standard treatment ( see ,",
    "_ e. g. _ @xcite ) , we consider a `` center '' site , and its surrounding neighbors .",
    "we write the probability that the center site is occupied , with @xmath37 nearest neighbors also being occupied , as    @xmath38    where @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the normalization , and @xmath41 is introduced to account for the influence of the rest of the lattice . the rest of the terms explicitly account for the interactions and the chemical potential corresponding to the number of occupied sites present .",
    "similarly , the probability that the center site is not occupied , with @xmath37 neighbors occupied , is    @xmath42    the normalization factor @xmath40 is given by the condition    @xmath43   = 1\\ ] ]    the average occupancy number @xmath44 for the the center site is the probability that the center is occupied regardless of the occupancy of the surrounding sites , that is :    @xmath45    the average occupancy number @xmath46 for a given neighbor site is given by    @xmath47.\\ ] ]    the unknown parameter @xmath41 is now determined by the condition that these two occupancy number , @xmath44 and @xmath46 are both equal to @xmath18 .",
    "defining a function    @xmath48    the solution is found by the condition @xmath49 .",
    "determining @xmath41 in this way , and using the expression for @xmath44 above , one obtains the probability of occupation as a funciton of @xmath2 and @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , imposing the condition that the first and second derivatives of @xmath50 also vanish yeilds the condition for the critical point , since this vanishing of the first and second derivatives marks the change from the high temperature regime where only one solution exists , to the presence of more than one solution at lower temperatures .",
    "in addition , the condition that the first derivative vanishes is used to locate the spinodal points .",
    "figure 3 shows the dependence of the critical density , temperature , and the chemical potential on the parameter @xmath7 which is varied in integer steps for @xmath33 .",
    "the case of @xmath12 reproduces the standard result for this approximation .",
    "it is seen that the critical temperature decreases very slowly at first as @xmath7 is reduced , but goes to zero for @xmath51 .",
    "interestingly , the case of @xmath52 displays a finite critical temperature , which is somewhat surprising , since in this case the system can form only two bonds at each site , and one expects this to be equivalent to a one dimensional system with a vanishing critical temperature .     for the bethe - peierls approximation.,width=566 ]",
    "we next calculate the spinodals that demarcate the region of instability in the @xmath53 phase diagram for @xmath54 , which is shown in fig .",
    "4 . as in the mean field case the region of instability also shrinks with the reduction in the valency .     and",
    "@xmath54 .,width=566 ]",
    "in order to estimate the accuracy of the approximations above , we evaluate the critical parameters and the co - existence lines for different values of @xmath7 using computer simulations , emplying the histogram reweighting technique @xcite . in this method ,",
    "histograms of sampled energies and number densities from simulations at different external parameters are used to estimate composite probability distributions , which in turn may be used to obtain information on phase equilibrium . to this end , we perform monte carlo simulations in the constant temperature and constant chemical potential ensemble for a lattice of @xmath55 sites arranged in an @xmath56 lattice .",
    "the energy of the system depends not only on which sites are occupied , but also which bonds exist in the system .",
    "therefore , care must be taken that the formation and deletion of bonds obeys detailed balance . in the grand canonical simulations ,",
    "it is sufficient , when a particle is inserted , to pick any of the possible bond configurations at random , with equal probability . at each simulated temperature and chemical potential , runs of length @xmath57 million monte carlo cycles ( mcs ) .",
    "the energies and number of particles every @xmath58 mcs , after an equilibration of @xmath59 million mcs , are used to build histograms @xmath60 ( where @xmath20 is the number of particles and @xmath61 is the energy ) , where @xmath62 indexes the different runs at different @xmath23 and @xmath2 values .",
    "as described in @xcite , the composite probability distribtion @xmath63 is obtained with    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the total number of observations for each run , and the constants @xmath66 are obtained iteratively from the relationship    @xmath67    once the above equations are run to convergence , the probability distribution in particle number can be obtained by summing @xmath68 over the energies .",
    "phase co - existence at any given temperature is obtained by requiring that the distribution with respect to density has two distinct peaks , of equal height .",
    "figure 5 shows the coexistence curves obtained for the cases @xmath69 . studying phase coexistence at lower values of @xmath7",
    "is severely hampered by the extremely slow equilibration in the temperature range of interest and has not been attempted . in each of the cases",
    "studied , evaluating the coexisting phase densities is limited by the ability resolve the coexisting density peaks , which is difficult as the critical point is approached .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear from the data shown that the simulations confirm the trend seen in the calculations above , that the critical tempeature , density and ( minus ) the chemical potential decrease as @xmath7 decreases .",
    "figure 6 shows the critical parameters in comparison with the bethe - peierls calculations .",
    "it is seen that the critical paramters drop more rapidly than suggested by the bethe - peierls calculations . unlike the @xmath70 case , where the coexistence chemical potential and the mean of the coexisting densities are constant below the critical temperature , both these quantities increase as one moves to lower temperatures below the critical temperature .     from simulations , showing that the coexistence region shrinks as @xmath7 decreases.,width=566 ]",
    "we have presented results for lattice gas models with the imposition of a constraint on the maximum number of bonds that particles can participate in .",
    "mean field ( bragg - williams and bethe - peierls ) calculations and computer simulations using the histogram reweighting technique , show that the critical temperature and density decrease as the maximum number of bonds allowed for a given particle is reduced .",
    "also , we find that the density range of the coexistence region , where the liquid and gas phases coexist , shrinks as the maximum valency of the particles is reduced . these results are consistent with the results that have been obtained earlier for similarly defined continuum models @xcite .",
    "it is thus confirmed that valency reduction is effective in opening a large region of densities in which low temperature disordered states can be accessed in equilibrium .",
    "studies of models with controlled valency , both on the lattice and off - lattice , may make it possible to disentangle gelation from phase separation .",
