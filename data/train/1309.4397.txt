    "this compact ` oscilloscope - on - a - chip ' is designed for the recording of radio - frequency ( rf ) transient waveforms with signal bandwidths between 100  mhz and 1.5  ghz .",
    "the detection of discrete photons and high - energy particles is the basis of a wide range of commercial and scientific applications . in many of these applications ,",
    "the relative arrival time of an incident photon or particle is best measured by extracting features from the full waveform at the detector output  @xcite .",
    "additional benefits of front - end waveform sampling include the detection of pile - up events and the ability to filter noise or poorly formed pulses",
    ".    for recording ` snapshots ' of transient waveforms , switched capacitor array ( sca ) analog memories can be used to sample a limited time - window at a relatively high rate , but with a latency - cost of a slower readout speed  @xcite .",
    "these devices are well suited for triggered - event applications , as in many high energy physics experiments , in which some dead - time on each channel is acceptable . with modern cmos integrated circuit design",
    ", these sca sampling chips can be compact , low power , and have a relatively low cost per channel  @xcite .    over the last decade , sampling rates in sca waveform sampling asics have been pushed to several gsa / s with analog bandwidths of several hundred mhz up to @xmath31  ghz  @xcite . as a scalable front - end readout option coupled with the advantages of waveform sampling ,",
    "these asics have been used in a wide range of experiments ; such as high - energy physics colliders  @xcite , gamma - ray astronomy  @xcite , high - energy neutrino detection  @xcite , and rare decay searches  @xcite .      a natural extension to the existing waveform sampling asics is to push design parameters that are inherently fabrication - technology limited .",
    "parameters such as sampling rate and analog bandwidth are of particular interest considering the fast risetimes ( @xmath4@xmath5  @xmath3  60  -  500  ps ) and pulse widths ( fwhm  @xmath3 200  ps  -  1  ns ) of commercially available and novel technologies of micro - channel plate ( mcp ) and silicon photomultipliers  @xcite . these and other fast photo - optical or rf devices require electronics matched to the speed of the signals .",
    "the timing resolution of discrete waveform sampling is intuitively dependent on three primary factors as described by ritt  @xcite : @xmath6 where _ snr _ is the signal - to - noise ratio of the pulse , @xmath4@xmath5 is the 10 - 90% rise - time of the pulse , and _",
    "n@xmath7 _ is the number of independent samples on the rising edge within time @xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "the motivation for oversampling above the nyquist limit is that errors due to uncorrelated noise , caused both by random time jitter and charge fluctuations , are reduced by increasing the rising - edge sample size .",
    "accordingly , in order to preserve the timing properties of analog signals from a fast detector , the waveform recording electronics should 1 ) be low - noise , 2 ) match the signal bandwidth , and 3 ) have a fast sampling rate relative to the signal rise - time .",
    "the well - known advantages of reduced transistor feature size include higher clock speeds , greater circuit density , lower parasitic capacitances , and lower power dissipation per circuit  @xcite .",
    "the sampling rate and analog bandwidth of waveform sampling asics , which depend on clock speeds , parasitic capacitances , and interconnect lengths , are directly enhanced by moving to a smaller cmos technology .",
    "designing in a smaller technology also allows clocking of an on - chip analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) at a faster rate , reducing the chip dead - time .    with the advantages of reduced transistor feature sizes",
    "also comes increasingly challenging analog design issues .",
    "one issue is the increase of leakage current .",
    "leakage is enhanced by decreased source - drain channel lengths , causing subthreshold leakage ( v@xmath8 <  v@xmath9 ) , and decreased gate - oxide thickness , which promotes gate - oxide tunneling  @xcite .",
    "effects of leakage include increased quiescent power dissipation and potential non - linear effects when storing analog voltages .",

    "the available voltage range is given by ( v@xmath10-v@xmath9 ) , where v@xmath10 is the supply voltage and v@xmath9 is the threshold , or ` turn - on ' , voltage for a given transistor .",
    "for technologies above 0.1 @xmath0 m , the ( v@xmath10-v@xmath9 ) range is decreased with downscaled feature sizes to reduce high - field effects in the gate - oxide  @xcite . in the 0.13  @xmath0 m cmos process",
    ", the supply voltage v@xmath10 is 1.2  v and the values of v@xmath9 range from 0.42  v for a minimum - size transistor ( gate length 120 nm ) to roughly 0.2  v for a large transistor ( 5  @xmath0 m )  @xcite .",
    "the potential of waveform sampling design in 0.13  @xmath0 m cmos was shown with two previous asics .",

    "each sample point in the array is made from a switched capacitor sampling cell and an integrated adc circuit as shown in figure  [ psec_cell ] .    to operate the chip , a field - programmable gate array ( fpga ) is used to provide timing control , clock generation , readout addressing , data management , and general configurations to the asic .",
    "several analog voltage controls are also required for operation , and are provided by commercial digital - to - analog converter ( dac ) chips .",

    "the sampling signals are generated with a 256-stage voltage - controlled delay line ( vcdl ) , in which the individual stage time delay is adjustable by two complementary voltage controls .",

    "each stage in the vcdl is an rc delay element made from a cmos current - starved inverter .",
    "the inverse of the time delay between stages sets the sampling rate .",
    "rates of up to 17.5  gsa / s are possible with psec4 as shown in figure  [ fig : samplerate ] .",

    "the stability of the sampling rate is negatively correlated with the slope magnitude as the vcdl becomes increasingly sensitive to noise .",
    "the slowest stable sampling rate is @xmath34  gsa / s .",
    "a ` write strobe ' signal is sent from each stage of the vcdl to the corresponding sampling cell in each channel .",
    "the write strobe passes the vcdl - generated sampling rate to the sample - and - hold switch of the cell as shown in figure  [ psec_cell ] . to allow the sample cell enough time to fully charge or discharge when sampling , the write strobe is extended to a fixed duration of 8@xmath14 the individual vcdl delay stage . in sampling mode ,",
    "a ` sampling block ' made of 8 adjacent sca sampling cells continuously tracks the input signal .    to servo - control",
    "the vcdl at a specified sampling rate and to compensate for temperature effects and power supply variations , the vcdl can be delay - locked on chip .",

    "the psec4 has the capability to output a threshold - level trigger bit on each channel .",
    "the internal trigger is made from a fast comparator , which is referenced to an external threshold level , and digital logic to latch and reset the trigger circuit . to form a psec4 trigger ,",
    "the self - trigger bits are sent to the fpga , which returns a global trigger signal back to the chip . in the internal trigger mode",
    ", the trigger round - trip time is 15 - 20  ns ( depending on fpga algorithm ) , which allows for the recording of a waveform before it is overwritten at 10 gsa / s .",
