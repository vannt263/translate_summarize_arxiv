    "hadronic scattering in the late stages of a heavy - ion collision may modify the chemical composition of the system up to the time of chemical freeze - out , defined as when all non - resonant particle ratios are fixed .",
    "however , resonances may still be produced through inelastic hadronic scatterings , their production rates being dependent on the relatively poorly known hadronic cross - sections ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , etc . ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , rescattering of the daughters of resonances that decay during the lifetime of the colliding system may destroy their correlations .",
    "this prohibits the parent resonance reconstruction , leading to an underestimated primary yield .",
    "the interplay of these two effects continues from the time of chemical freeze - out ( @xmath7 ) to the time of thermal freeze - out ( @xmath8 , currently estimated to be @xmath98 - 10 fm/@xmath10 @xcite ) , the degree to which the primary resonance yields are modified depends on both the length of this time interval ( @xmath11 ) and the relative strengths of the two effects @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the _ in vacuo _ resonance masses and widths might be modified in the presence of the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "the star experiment @xcite has measured several mesonic and baryonic resonance states @xcite .",
    "the variation in the composition and lifetimes of the measured states provides multiple constraints on @xmath4 and the degree of late stage hadronic interactions .",
    "the measurements presented herein add to the emerging picture of how the medium produced in heavy - ion collisions at rhic affects resonance production .",
    "the results presented here come from an analysis of 7.6@xmath12 , 5.4@xmath12 , and 6.8@xmath12 au+au events in the 0 - 12% , 10 - 40% , and 40 - 80% centrality ranges respectively .",
    "the greatest difficulty in performing an analysis of short - lived particles is acquiring an accurate description of the underlying combinatorial background .",
    "for this analysis , we use a narrow rotational method that is implemented as follows .    in each event",
    ", the invariant mass is calculated for each topologically found @xmath13 candidate that passes a set of quality cuts combined with each @xmath14 candidate that has passed a set of particle identification cuts .",
    "these combinations comprise the `` signal '' . a second set of combinations",
    "is then made in which the transverse momentum ( @xmath15 ) vectors of the @xmath13 candidates are rotated in the azimuthal plane by angles from 170@xmath16 to 188@xmath16 and the @xmath14 candidates are rotated from -8@xmath16 to + 8@xmath16 , both in steps of 2@xmath16 . the invariant mass is then calculated for each iteration and each pair .",
    "these combinations comprise the `` background '' .",
    "the process is repeated as a function of @xmath15 and the background is then subtracted from the signal in each bin .",
    "lastly , the yield is determined by summing the bin contents in a narrow region around the canonical mass .",
    "efficiency and acceptance corrections are applied to the results .",
    "lastly , a correction is applied to account for contribution to the overall yield coming from the neutral decay channel , which we do not measure here .",
    "the corrected mid - rapidity spectra for three centralities are show in figure [ spectra ] .",
    "information about medium effects on resonance production is gained by comparing the resonance yield to that of its non - resonant partner . in figure [ ratios ] we show this comparison , plotted as a ratio of the resonance to non - resonance yield , for the relevant species measured by star . the mid - rapidity ( @xmath17 ) @xmath0 @xmath18 yields are compared with ( @xmath19 ) @xmath3 @xmath18 yields from reference @xcite .    these comparisons are usually shown scaled by the @xmath20 value . however , as there is currently no measured @xmath20 ratio for the @xmath0 , the ratios have all been scaled by the most central au+au values .",
    "this alternative scaling results in what is usually seen as a supression in central au+au appearing as an enhancement in peripheral ( and @xmath20 ) collisions and an enhancement in central au+au appearing as a suppression in peripheral ( and @xmath20 ) collisions .",
    "examining the ratios we find the following : the shortest lived resonance measured by star , the k@xmath21 , shows a small suppression in central collisions relative to peripheral @xcite , and the only slightly longer - lived @xmath22 shows no measurable effect @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 ratios show an _ enhancement _ in the most central collisions relative to the peripheral collisions , the opposite of what is seen for the other reasonably long - lived baryonic resonance , the @xmath23 , which shows a strong suppression in central collisions relative to @xmath20 .",
    "the short - lived resonances would be expected to show suppression in more central events due to the rescattering of their decay products .",
    "the fact that they are only weakly suppressed , if at all , suggests there must be significant regeneration contributing to the final state yields .",
    "this conclusion is strengthened when one adds the @xmath0 measurement to the picture .",
    "the @xmath0 should easily outlive the system ( on average ) once it s produced .",
    "this means rescattering does not significantly affect the @xmath0 yield , ( re-)generation plays a stronger role .",
    "the observed @xmath0 enhancement in central collisions seems to indicate that significant interaction , and resonance production , occurs between @xmath3 and @xmath24 particles in the ( late ) hadronic phase .",
    "the @xmath25 meson , like the @xmath0 , will not on average decay before @xmath8 .",
    "however , hadronic phase @xmath25 production may be suppressed by the relatively low probability for k@xmath26+k@xmath27 scattering in the final stages of the collision @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 is also reasonably long - lived . however , alternative explanations have been put forward for the observed @xmath23 suppression that do not involve rescattering and regeneration @xcite .",
    "lastly , in figure [ thermus ] we show the results of a thermal model fit to the published star data from central @xmath28 au+au collisions .",
    "the fit was performed using the thermus interface @xcite .",
    "the resulting fit parameters are t=0.169@xmath290.006 gev , @xmath30=0.04@xmath290.01 gev , @xmath31=0.016@xmath290.009 gev , @xmath32=-0.01@xmath290.01 gev , @xmath33=0.91@xmath290.06 , and radius=7.5@xmath291.0 fm .",
    "all of the resonance to non - resonance ratios are shown to the right of the `` fitted '' line compared to their predicted values from the thermal fit .",
    "the same pattern of suppression and enhancement as was seen in the ratios alone shows - up again .",
    "the thermal model gives predictions for particle ratios only at @xmath7 , and therefore does not account for production that occurs during the hadronic phase , and so the observed @xmath0 enhancement could again be attributed to significant resonance production occurring during the hadronic phase .",
    "this result strengthens the conclusion drawn from the resonance to non - resonance ratios alone .",
