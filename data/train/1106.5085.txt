    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak and strong interactions based on the gauge group @xmath7 has been rigorously tested in many ways@xcite , in different sectors involving gauge bosons , quarks and leptons .",

    "there are no right handed neutrinos , and the left handed neutrinos are massless .",
    "this theory conserves lepton flavor of each family separately , and no flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes are allowed in the leptonic sector .",
    "however , the observation of neutrino oscillations requires both a non - zero neutrino mass and lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) .",
    "the sm has to be extended to give neutrino masses and explain their mixing through a mixing matrix in the charged currents analogous to the ckm matrix in the quark sector , the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) mixing matrix@xcite .",
    "there are many ways to extend the sm to have neutrino masses and mixing , for example , introduction of right - handed neutrinos to have dirac mass , or to invoke seesaw mechanism to have majorana mass , or to have loop induced masses .",
    "the existence of mixing among different lepton generations will induce fcnc interactions with lfv . to further understand the properties of the underlying theory , one should not only study whether a model can produce the correct neutrino masses and their mixing , it is also necessary to study possible implications for other fcnc interaction and confront them with existing and future experimental data .",
