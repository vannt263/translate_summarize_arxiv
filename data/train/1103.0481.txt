    "astronomical observations and measurements indicate that more than 80% of all matter in the universe is dark ( i.e. , interacts at most very weakly with electromagnetic radiation and ordinary matter ) .",
    "the dominant component of this cosmological dark matter must be due to some yet to be discovered , non  baryonic particles . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xmath1 arising in several extensions of the standard model of electroweak interactions are one of the leading candidates for dark matter .",
    "wimps are stable particles with masses roughly between 10 gev and a few tev and interact with ordinary matter only weakly ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "currently , the most promising method to detect different wimp candidates is the direct detection of the recoil energy deposited in a low  background underground detector by elastic scattering of ambient wimps off target nuclei @xcite .",
    "the recoil energy spectrum can be calculated from an integral over the one  dimensional velocity distribution function of halo wimps , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the absolute value of the wimp velocity in the laboratory frame . in our earlier work @xcite",
    ", we presented a way to reconstruct this one  dimensional velocity distribution function and to estimate its moments from the recoil spectrum as well as from measured recoil energies _ directly _ in direct dark matter detection experiments .",
    "_ neither _ the wimp  nucleus scattering cross section _ nor _ the local wimp density is required in this analysis .",
    "however , the mass of halo wimps is needed for the reconstruction of the ( moments of the ) wimp velocity distribution .",
    "therefore , as the next step we developed a model ",
    "independent method based on the reconstruction of the moments of @xmath2 for determining the wimp mass @xmath4 by combining two sets of ( future ) experimental data with different target nuclei directly @xcite . to do so",
    ", one simply requires that the values of a given moment of @xmath2 estimated by both experiments agree .",
    "this leads to a simple expression for determining @xmath4 , which can be solved analytically and each moment can be used .",
    "moreover , by assuming that the ratio of the spin ",
    "independent ( si ) scattering cross sections on protons and on neutrons is known , an additional expression for determining @xmath4 has be derived . by combining the estimators for different moments with each other and with the estimator derived by making the assumption about the ratio of the si cross sections , one can yield the best estimate of the wimp mass @xcite .",
    "here we found again that neither a prior knowledge about the wimp  nucleus cross section nor that about the local wimp density is required .",
    "meanwhile , in the second method for the determination of the wimp mass , the product of the local wimp density times the si wimp  proton cross section , @xmath5 , appearing in the expression for the scattering spectrum cancels out when we use the identity of this product for two different targets . hence , as will be shown in the paper , once the wimp mass can be determined one could then use this information to estimate @xmath6 conversely . remind that , in order to identify new particles produced at e.g. , the large hardon collider ( lhc ) to be indeed wimps detected by direct detection @xcite , estimates of or constraints on their mass and couplings on nucleons from direct detection experiments are essential . however , due to the degeneracy between @xmath7 and @xmath6 , for estimating the si wimp cross section by this method one has to make an assumption for the local wimp density , which can so far be estimated with an uncertainty of a factor of @xmath0 2 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our simulations show that , in spite of the large statistical uncertainty due to very few events , for a wimp mass of @xmath0 100 gev , @xmath6 could be estimated with an uncertainty of 30% by using 2 ( or 3 ) @xmath8 50 events from experiments .",
