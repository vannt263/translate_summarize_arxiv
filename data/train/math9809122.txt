    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote two partitions of length @xmath3 , identified in the usual way with dominant integral weights of the complex lie algebra @xmath4 .",
    "it was shown by lusztig @xcite that the multiplicity @xmath5 of the weight @xmath6 in the finite - dimensional irreducible representation @xmath7 of @xmath4 with highest weight @xmath8 is the value at 1 of a certain kazhdan - lusztig polynomial @xmath9 for the affine symmetric group @xmath10 .",
    "( for the definition of @xmath11 , see below section  [ subsect21 ] ) . moreover , lusztig proved @xcite that the polynomial @xmath12 is equal to the kostka - foulkes polynomial @xmath13 defined as the coefficient of the schur function @xmath14 on the basis of hall - littlewood function @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "a combinatorial expression of @xmath13 had previously been given by lascoux and schtzenberger in terms of semi - standard young tableaux @xcite .",
    "it is well known that @xmath5 is also equal to the multiplicity of @xmath7 as an irreducible component of the tensor product @xmath16 of symmetric powers of the vector representation of @xmath4 .",
    "let now @xmath17 be arbitrary dominant weights and let @xmath18 denote the multiplicity of @xmath7 in @xmath19 a @xmath0-analogue @xmath20 of this multiplicity has been introduced in @xcite by means of certain generalizations of semi - standard young tableaux called ribbon tableaux , and it has been proved that when the partitions @xmath21 have only one part @xmath22 @xmath23 the purpose of this paper is to establish that for all @xmath24 the @xmath20 are kazhdan - lusztig polynomials for the group @xmath10 .",
    "let us outline how this result is obtained . as mentioned by lusztig in @xcite , the expression of the weight multiplicity @xmath5 as a value at 1 of a kazhdan - lusztig polynomial",
    "might be deduced from the conjecture of @xcite for the characters of irreducible representations of @xmath25 over an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath26 together with the steinberg tensor product theorem . in @xcite",
    "a similar conjecture was formulated for the characters of irreducible representations of @xmath27 when @xmath28 is a primitive @xmath29th root of 1 .",
    "a remarkable feature of the quantum conjecture is that the restriction @xmath26 is no longer necessary .",
    "this conjecture is now proved due to work of kazhdan - lusztig and kashiwara - tanisaki . on the other hand lusztig",
    "has derived in @xcite an analogue of the steinberg tensor product theorem for the quantum case . from these two facts , it is easy to deduce that the littlewood - richardson multiplicities are value at 1 of kazhdan - lusztig polynomials ( see below , section  [ sect3 ] )",
    ".    however this would not provide the link with the @xmath0-analogues defined by means of ribbon tableaux .",
    "we shall therefore follow a different approach and rely on the construction given in @xcite of a canonical basis in the level 1 fock space representation of the quantum affine algebra @xmath30 .",
    "this canonical basis satisfies a formal @xmath0-analogue of steinberg s tensor product theorem which may be formulated in terms of the combinatorics of ribbon tableaux . on the other hand , varagnolo and vasserot @xcite",
    "have recently verified a conjecture of @xcite .",
    "they proved that the coefficients of the expansion of this canonical basis on the standard basis of @xmath0-wedge products coincide with the kazhdan - lusztig polynomials occuring in lusztig s conjecture .",
    "using these two results , we are able to express the @xmath20 as kazhdan - lusztig polynomials .    more precisely , they belong to a family of parabolic analogues of kazhdan - lusztig polynomials introduced by deodhar @xcite .",
    "there are two types of such polynomials associated with the hecke algebra modules obtained by inducing respectively the characters @xmath31 and @xmath32 of a parabolic subalgebra .",
    "the @xmath20 turn out to belong to the family denoted by @xmath33 in @xcite and by @xmath34 in @xcite , which is less well understood .",
    "in particular @xmath33 may be 0 even if @xmath35 in the bruhat ordering .",
    "also , since the @xmath33 are equal to alternating sums of ordinary kazhdan - lusztig polynomials , it is not a priori clear whether these polynomials have non - negative coefficients .",
    "however , according to experts , it seems probable that they admit a geometrical interpretation in terms of schubert varieties of finite codimension in an affine flag manifold .",
    "this would settle the positivity conjecture vi.3 of @xcite .",
    "note that in the case of two factors the polynomials @xmath36 are known to have non - negative coefficients because of their combinatorial interpretation in terms of yamanouchi domino tableaux given in @xcite .    that the non - vanishing of the polynomials @xmath33 is",
    "a difficult problem should not be too surprising .",
    "indeed , our result shows that this contains as a special case the non - vanishing of the littlewood - richardson coefficients .",
    "there has been some important recent progress by klyachko on this classical subject @xcite using toric vector bundles on the projective plane ( see the reviews of zelevinsky @xcite and fulton @xcite ) . maybe some new understanding will arise from the connection with affine schubert varieties .",
    "a few comments concerning the growing literature on @xmath0-analogues of littlewood - richardson coefficients are in order . in @xcite shimozono and weyman",
    "have studied the poincar polynomials of isotypic components of some virtual graded @xmath25-modules supported in the closure of a nilpotent conjugacy class .",
    "these are @xmath0-analogues of littlewood - richardson multiplicities @xmath18 satisfying a @xmath0-kostant formula and a morris - like recurrence . in the case where all partitions @xmath21 are rectangular ( the corresponding weights are multiples of a single fundamental weight ) and are arranged in non - increasing order of width ,",
    "these polynomials have non - negative coefficients .",
    "( this is not true in general , but see @xcite , conjecture 4 . ) in this case , a combinatorial interpretation in terms of semi - standard young tableaux was given by shimozono @xcite , which shows that they coincide with the generalized kostka - foulkes polynomials studied by schilling and warnaar @xcite in relation with exactly solvable lattice models and rogers - ramanujan type identities . a different combinatorial interpretation using rigged configurations",
    "has been conjectured by kirillov and shimozono @xcite and recently verified @xcite .",
    "it is believed that for rectangular shapes in non - increasing order these poincar polynomials are equal to the corresponding @xmath20 but the reason for that is still unclear .",
    "let us describe more precisely the contents of this paper .",
    "the results rely mainly on four sources , namely the parabolic analogue of kazhdan - lusztig polynomials developed by deodhar in @xcite , our joint paper with lascoux on ribbon tableaux and generalizations of kostka - foulkes polynomials @xcite , our previous note @xcite , and the paper of varagnolo and vasserot @xcite .",
    "since @xcite contains no proofs , and since only a small part of @xcite and @xcite is needed to obtain our results , we thought it would be appropriate to provide a self - contained exposition of this material .",
    "thus the style of the paper is openly expository and we hope it can be read without a previous knowledge of these four sources .",
    "however for what concerns parabolic kazhdan - lusztig polynomials , we decided to omit the proofs because they can be found in the optimum exposition by soergel of kazhdan - lusztig theory from scratch @xcite .",
    "so in section  [ sect2 ] we explain all the necessary background on ( extended ) affine symmetric groups @xmath10 and their hecke algebras @xmath37 .",
    "in particular we introduce the two presentations ( coxeter - type and bernstein - type ) and give the relations between them .",
    "following @xcite we construct a representation of @xmath37 on the weight lattice @xmath38 of @xmath4 and introduce its two kazhdan - lusztig bases .",
    "the coefficients of these bases on the basis of weights are the parabolic kazhdan - lusztig polynomials ( for various parabolic subgroups ) .    in section  [ sect3 ] , we recall the lusztig conjecture for quantum @xmath4 at an @xmath29th root of 1 , the tensor product theorem , and using a formula of littlewood we deduce from this that the littlewood - richardson coefficients are value at 1 of parabolic kazhdan - lusztig polynomials ( theorem  [ th3 ] ) .",
    "in section  [ sect4 ] we recall following @xcite the definitions of ribbon tableaux and their spin , we introduce the @xmath0-analogues @xmath20 , and we state our main result ( theorem  [ th4 ] ) .    in section  [ sect5 ]",
    "we explain the construction of @xcite and consider a quotient @xmath39 of @xmath38 whose bases are naturally labelled by dominant integral @xmath4-weights .",
    "this space can be identified in a natural way with the ( finitized ) @xmath0-deformed fock space of kashiwara , miwa and stern @xcite considered in @xcite .",
    "projecting on @xmath39 the kazhdan - lusztig involution of @xmath38 one gets the involution defined in @xcite in terms of @xmath0-wedge products .",
    "this implies that the canonical bases of @xcite have coefficients given by some parabolic kazhdan - lusztig polynomials ( theorem  [ thvv ] ) .",
    "in section  [ sect6 ] we study the action of the center @xmath40 of @xmath37 on @xmath39 and show that it can be expressed via the combinatorics of ribbon tableaux .",
    "we then prove that the vectors @xmath41 of the canonical basis indexed by non - restricted weights are obtained from the restricted ones by acting with an element of @xmath40 .",
    "this should be regarded as an analogue in this setting of the steinberg - lusztig tensor product theorem .",
    "then we give the proof of theorem  [ th4 ] .",
    "in section  [ sect7 ] we review the construction of kashiwara , miwa and stern of the fock space @xmath42 obtained by taking the limit @xmath43 in @xmath39 .",
    "it affords a level 1 integrable representation of the quantum affine algebra @xmath30 .",
    "we investigate the behaviour of the canonical bases of @xmath42 with respect to the semi - linear involution induced by the conjugation of partitions , and derive from this a symmetry of the polynomials @xmath20 ( theorem  [ thconj ] ) and an inversion formula for parabolic kazhdan - lusztig polynomials ( corollary  [ corinv ] ) .",
    "this formula , together with a result of du , parshall and scott @xcite , provides an alternative proof of soergel s character formula for tilting modules in type @xmath44 ( remark  [ remtilt ] ) .",
    "finally section  [ sect8 ] provides some numerical tables of @xmath0-littlewood - richardson multiplicities and kazhdan - lusztig polynomials , which may serve as examples of the results discussed in the text .",
