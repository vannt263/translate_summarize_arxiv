    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm consists in postulating a dark matter ( dm ) component with small velocity dispersion in the early universe .",
    "a straightforward consequence is the prediction of an abundance of structures on sub - galactic scales .",
    "the cdm model has been collecting enormous successes in explaining large scale observations , over a wide range of redshifts . on the other hand ,",
    "a number of tensions have emerged in the description of the smallest scales , such as the innermost regions of galactic dm halos and the local group dwarf galaxy satellites .",
    "the cdm controversies include the so - called `` cusp - core '' , `` missing satellites '' , and `` too big to fail '' problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies , and in particular the milky way ( mw ) satellites , are key actors in all of these issues  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the central density profiles of dsphs have been suggested to be much shallower than predicted in the cdm scenario ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . on the other hand , while the cusp - core controversy appears to be evident in low surface brightness spiral galaxies ( where the profile is derived from rotation curves ) , some uncertainties in the description of the gravitational potential from the observed dsph velocity dispersion ( in particular related to the anisotropy of the stellar velocity ) leave the question still open in the case of dsphs .    in cosmological n - body cdm simulations ,",
    "the formation of mw - like halos preserves a large amount of subhalos ( formed in early - time collapses on small scales ) .",
    "this leads to the prediction of thousands of mw satellites which is at odds with the few tens observed .",
    "the disagreement still persists even after the recent discovery of about 15 new ultra - faint dsphs ( uds ) .",
    "however , taking into account the completeness limits of the sdss observations , this issue can be alleviated .",
    "indeed , applying luminosity bias corrections , @xcite found that few hundreds of uds should be present within the mw virial radius .",
    "in the same dissipationless simulations , more than about six massive satellites with maximum circular velocity greater than 30 km / sec are predicted  @xcite , while no similar objects have been observed from the mw or andromeda s satellites .",
    "this is particularly puzzling since such objects are at the high mass end of the dsph mass spectrum and have the gravitational potential largely dominated by dm ( thus simulation results should be robust despite the baryonic contribution is neglected ) .",
    "larger galaxies typically show monotonic relation between luminosity and halo circular velocity ( or halo mass ) , while the presence of such massive dark subhalos would strongly violate this relation  @xcite .",
    "a solution of the aforementioned issues might reside in a departure from the collisionless cdm scheme foreseeing a suppression of small - scale structures either in the primordial power spectrum or due to dm - induced effects during structure formation .",
    "assuming instead the cdm paradigm to be correct , the solution could lie in baryonic physics , and in particular in connection with supernova feedbacks and low star formation ( sf ) efficiency . a variety of studies and simulations have shown that baryonic effects could possibly lead to cores in dm halos and suppress sf in low mass halos ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the mw satellites are crucial laboratories for testing the validity of such solutions .",
    "the inefficiency in sf can be explained by a low gas density content in dsphs , below the density threshold for sf .",
    "different mechanisms have been suggested in order to either prevent gas collection in dsphs ( as , e.g. , heating of intergalactic gas by the ultraviolet photoionizing background  @xcite ) or removing gas out of the shallow gravitational potential of dsphs ( with , e.g. , early feedback effects or tidal streams of gas in the dsph orbit around the mw  @xcite ) .",
    "measurements of the presence of gas in dsphs would thus be crucial to discriminate among some of the proposed solutions .",
    "the injection of energy associated with feedbacks should have left some imprints in the magnetic properties and high - energy cosmic - ray ( cr ) content of the dsphs . indeed the generation of magnetic fields in galaxies is often associated with dynamo processes , which are sustained by the turbulent energy sourced in turn by supernova explosions .",
    "the same mechanisms can accelerate low - energy electrons up to tev - pev energies ( for a recent review of the role of supernovae as cr and magnetic source , see , e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "radio observations can probe the synchrotron radiation associated with high - energy electrons spiraling in an ambient magnetic field .",
    "in this project , we performed deep mosaic radio observations of a sample of six local dsphs with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "we simultaneously collected continuum data ( in the 1.1 - 3.1 ghz band ) and hi spectral line data ( at 1.4 ghz ) .",
    "the latter is associated with the atomic transition of neutral hydrogen and will be analysed to constrain the gas mass in dsphs in a future work . in this paper ( paper ii ) , we discuss the search for a diffuse continuum component .",
    "the level of the achieved rms sensitivity is around 0.05 mjy / beam .",
    "a recent attempt in the same direction but making use of single dish observations was performed by @xcite with the green bank telescope .    due to existing bounds on dsph gas density  @xcite , thermal emissions are likely to be very dim .",
    "our search focuses on the possible presence of a non - thermal synchrotron emission associated with high - energy electrons interacting with the interstellar magnetic field .",
    "the expected emission is weak and on relatively large scale ( over the dsph size , which is typically several arcmin ) .",
    "this requires , on one side , a sensitivity enhancement which is provided by wide - band observations , and , on the other side , a wide - field strategy ( obtained by means of compact configurations of the atca telescope ) to access large scales and also mosaicking to map the predicted full extent of the dsph source .",
    "an intrinsic limitation of interferometric observations is that physical scales much larger than the reciprocal of the shortest baseline in the array are not detectable .",
    "this limitation can be overcome by including data from a large single antenna , to fill in the zero - spacing region of the visibility plane .",
    "accompanying single dish data were not available for these observations , however . on the other hand ,",
    "the scales accessible with the interferometric observations cover the size of the expected emission , as we will discuss .    because of the wide - bandwidth of the atca receivers , the beam size varies considerably over the frequency band .",
    "the changing beam size manifests as a changing gain across the band , for off - axis sources .",
    "this variation with frequency can be interpreted as structure during imaging , and can result in imaging artefacts for off - axis emissions .",
    "they can be mitigated through the use of frequency - dependent imaging techniques , which simultaneously solve for the spatial and spectral variation of the source .",
    "although there are a number of effective methods of wide - band imaging for a single pointing , joint imaging of mosaic pointings is still an unsolved algorithmic problem for the wide - band case .",
    "this is due to the frequency - varying primary beam effect over each mosaic panel , which introduces frequency - dependent gains across the image that will differ from panel to panel in overlapping regions .",
    "a significant part of the project has been thus to investigate how state - of - the - art imaging algorithms can deal with such problematics ( see also paper i  @xcite ) , which will become more and more pressing with the next - generation of radio telescopes , and in particular with the square kilometre array ( ska ) .",
    "we adopted the mfclean algorithm in _ miriad _ which was found to provide satisfactory results , as shown in the following and in paper i. it implements the algorithm of @xcite to model the source brightness distribution with a linear variation in frequency . the data reduction and imaging are summarized in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the observing setup is composed by both a compact array of five antennas and long baselines involving a sixth antenna .",
    "short - spacings are required to detect extended emissions .",
    "for the adopted array , we obtain a synthesized beam of about 1 arcmin and a maximum detectable scale of about 15 arcmin . with such large beam , however , the confusion limit is quickly reached .",
    "long baselines provide , on the other hand , high - resolution mapping of the small - scale background sources .",
    "they are then subtracted from the short - baseline maps to reduce the confusion noise , as explained in section  [ sec : diff ] .",
    "this is done both directly from the data and in the image plane .",
    "we remind that , since we use an interferometric technique , the data are collected in the so - called visibility ( or uv ) plane , which is related to the image plane by means of a fourier transformation . the median radio source angular size of extragalactic background objects with flux",
    "lower than about 100 mjy ( namely , sources present in the dsph fields , see paper i ) is below 10 arcsec , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "clouds within the dsph or in the galaxy might contribute at few tens of arcsec scales , but their presence is likely to be negligible .",
    "therefore , although having a complete coverage of the uv plane would be clearly ideal , an observing setup including long baselines to cover scales up to about 10 arcsec and short spacings to measure few arcmin diffuse emissions ( as the one employed in this work ) can be adequate to infer the presence of a signal .",
    "starting from the sf history of the observed dsphs ( inferred , in particular , through colour - magnitude diagrams ) , we derived estimates for the expected magnetic field strength and cr content .",
    "they are described in section  [ sec : mod ] and table  [ tableb ] .",
    "the possibility of having high - energy electrons and positrons injected through dm annihilations or decays is investigated in paper iii  @xcite .",
    "the cr spatial diffusion and energy losses are modelled with a special care , developing a new numerical solution of the transport equation which is reported in the appendix .    after introducing the statistical technique , in section  [ sec : ana ]",
    "we test the presence of a diffuse component .",
    "we report bounds on a variety of physical quantities associated with the expected synchrotron emission .",
    "they include the total radio flux , the angular shape of the radio emissivity , the equipartition magnetic field , and the injection and equilibrium distributions of cr electrons .",
    "we present a detailed discussion on how the bounds on the cr population depend on the assumption concerning the magnetic properties of the dsphs .",
    "we also investigate the connection to far - infrared ( fir ) and x - ray observations .",
    "conclusions are in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]                  +                 +      we derive the upper limits on the diffuse emission assuming spherical symmetry and taking the diffuse radio emission to be centered at the optical center of the dsph . the uncertainty in the centroid position of the dsphs considered here is typically estimated to be below the arcmin level .",
    "since our sensitivity is rather homogeneous on a much larger scale , we do not expect a significant variation of the bounds due to possible misalignment between the assumed center of the spherical distribution of our models and the real dsph center . for similar reasons",
    ", we also expect only mild modifications of our bounds in case of departure from spherical symmetry ( e.g. ellipticity ) . in case of a positive detection ( which is unfortunately not our case ) both effects should instead be accounted for , in order to have a robust determination of the model parameters .",
    "constraints on the total dsph flux @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stot ] as a function of the size of the emission @xmath1 , while the angular profile is constrained in fig .",
    "[ fig : j0 ] ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : annuli_f15 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : stot ] , we compare the bounds that can be obtained by employing the different subtraction methods described in section  [ sec : diff ] , on the three types of maps ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) introduced in section  [ sec : obs ] . the brightness is modelled with a gaussian : @xmath5 $ ] .    for small source - sizes ,",
    "the @xmath2 map is the most constraining one , while only the tapered images @xmath3 and @xmath4 can probe scales from 1 to 15 arcmin . for illustrative purposes , the reported angular range in fig .",
    "[ fig : stot ] ( as in other figures below ) extends to slightly larger region , although , as described in section  [ sec : maxsize ] a full simulation ( for each model ) would be required to assess the actual sensitivity at scales @xmath6 .",
    "the source subtraction clearly reduces the total flux . on the other hand ,",
    "the trend of this variation among the different cases can significantly vary from dsph to dsph .",
    "indeed , the impact of the source subtraction depends on the quality of the image , on the beam model , and on the number and brightness of sources near the dsph center .",
    "the presence of two different lines with the same colour and style implies an evidence above 2-@xmath7 ( which is the c.l .",
    "chosen for the reported bounds ) . in this case , both an upper and a lower 95% c.l .",
    "limits can be derived . on the contrary",
    ", if only one curve is shown , it refers to the upper limit .",
    "as already mentioned , the source subtraction procedure often leaves some non - negligible level of residuals , which can lead to a spurious detection of a diffuse emission .",
    "therefore in fig .",
    "[ fig : stot ] , some targets show lower bounds not only in the maps including sources ( solid lines ) , but also after source - subtraction in the fourier ( dashed ) or image ( dotted ) planes . when both subtraction procedures are combined ( dash - dotted ) ,",
    "no significant detection is found , as already stated above .    from the most conservative case ( no subtraction ) to the most aggressive one ( subtraction in both uv and image planes ) , the upper bound can significantly vary , up to two or three orders of magnitude .            in fig .",
    "[ fig : j0 ] , we show the bounds on the emissivity of the diffuse signal averaged over the emission region @xmath8 , as a function of the physical size @xmath9 of the emission .",
    "we compare different spatial profiles described in section  [ sec : cr ] .",
    "the impact of the profile on the bounds of the spatially - averaged emissivity is mild , while obviously , the different models can lead to bounds which can be locally quite different .",
    "we highlight the physical sizes corresponding to the half - light radius of the stellar distribution @xmath10 ( see table  [ tableb ] ) and to the dm halo scale @xmath11 ( taken from  @xcite in the case of an nfw profile ) , which can be considered as the expected sizes of a possible extended emission in dsphs .",
    "the constraints are derived focusing on the @xmath3 maps with sources subtracted in the uv - plane ( sv cases ) .",
    "however , for completeness , in the case of a gaussian spatial profile , we report the curves obtained from the @xmath3 maps without subtracting sources ( labelled with ns ) and with the source subtraction performed both in the uv and image planes ( labelled with svi ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : n0vsrs ] , we derive constraints for the spatially averaged equilibrium distribution @xmath12 of cr electrons and positrons in the dsph .",
    "the spectrum is assumed to be a power law . in these plots , as for the following ones , we will consider the @xmath3 maps , with source subtraction performed in the uv - plane only , as our reference ( conservative ) images . as benchmark models for the magnetic field , we assume a strength @xmath13 given by the maximum value among the ones quoted in columns 4 - 6 of table  [ tableb ] and a spatial profile given by @xmath14 .",
    "we show the impact of the spatial profile and spectral index in the case of the carina dsph ( left - hand panel ) . as for fig .",
    "[ fig : j0 ] , the profile has a mild effect on the spatially averaged bounds .",
    "the choice of the spectrum is instead relevant , although the re - scaling of the bounds can be easily computed for the case of a power law .    in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : n0vsrs ] , we compare the bounds on @xmath12 with the estimates from sf reported in column 8 of table  [ tableb ] ( shown with filled circles ) .",
    "they indicate that if the estimates for the cr density associated with late - time sfr , @xmath15 , are correct , we need a few order - of - magnitude improvement in the observational sensitivity ( i.e. , to reach a fraction of @xmath16jy to njy ) , to probe the cds emission , which is thus possibly achievable by the ska .",
    "the emission related to sf in uds would require a very high sensitivity even for the ska .",
    "[ fig : a0vsrs ] is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : n0vsrs ] , but now we compute bounds on the injection distribution of cr electrons and positrons @xmath17 , rather than on the equilibrium distribution .",
    "the limits are derived in the loss at injection - place scenario described in section  [ sec : turb ] and assuming a power - law for the injection spectrum .",
    "note that the bounds in figs .",
    "[ fig : n0vsrs ] and [ fig : a0vsrs ] are somewhat dependent on the chosen extrema for the energy integration of the spectrum , in particular on @xmath18 . however , since the spectrum is a power - law , it is straightforward for the reader to derive the bound with a choice of @xmath18 different from 0.1 gev .",
    "[ fig : a0vsb0 ] shows how different scenarios for the magnetic field strength and turbulence can change the constraints on the cr injection distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : a0vsrs ] .",
    "the impact of the magnetic field strength is discussed in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : a0vsb0 ] .",
    "the scaling of the curves follows from the scaling of the emissivity .",
    "the magnetic field affects both the synchrotron power via eq .",
    "[ eqjsynch ] and the cr energy losses via eq .",
    "[ eq : eloss ] .",
    "when synchrotron losses are subdominant with respect to ic losses , the emissivity scales as @xmath19 , following the scaling of the power . at large @xmath20 ,",
    "the curves flatten because synchrotron radiation becomes the dominant energy - loss mechanism and an increase in @xmath20 shows up in an approximately equal increase in both @xmath21 and @xmath22 , leaving @xmath23 const .",
    "the observational bounds on the strength of @xmath20 under the equipartition assumption ( shown in table  [ tableb ] ) are @xmath24 few @xmath25 , while expectations from theoretical arguments leads to about the @xmath25-scale . taking the latter estimate for the strength , the increase in sensitivity needed to probe a signal with cr density at equipartition with such magnetic field , roughly scales with the fourth power of the ratio between the current equipartition bound and the expected magnetic field strength .",
    "this scenario is thus within the reach of the ska , and , in some cases , also of its precursors askap and meerkat .",
    "note also that the bounds in fig .",
    "[ fig : n0vsrs ] would be significantly stronger under the equipartition assumption ( and close to @xmath26 in the case of the fornax and sculptor dsphs ) , exactly because the magnetic field would be significantly larger .",
    "the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : a0vsb0 ] shows the impact of diffusion effects on the derived bounds .",
    "a diffusion similar to the one observed in the mw ( see discussion in section  [ sec : turb ] ) makes the bound weaker by about one order of magnitude for the largest dsphs ( carina , fornax , sculptor , and hercules ) and by about two orders of magnitude for the smallest systems ( bootesii and segue2 ) with respect to the loss at injection - place case shown in the previous plots .",
    "we assumed a kolmogorov spectrum , with the diffusion coefficient exponentially increasing outside the stellar region : @xmath27 .    in the free - escape scenario ,",
    "the bounds worsen by about four and five orders of magnitude , respectively .",
    "we remind the reader that , as discussed in section  [ sec : turb ] , a free - escape is probably extreme and too pessimistic , and the allowed range can shrink by a factor of few taking into account cr self - confinement .",
    "the uncertainty associated with spatial diffusion is thus very relevant , as expected .",
    "this is indeed due to the smallness and low level of activity ( at present time ) of dsphs .",
    "a tight correlation between global radio and fir flux of normal star - forming galaxies has been observed to exist over many orders of magnitude in luminosities and up to intermediate redshifts  @xcite .",
    "the correlation is probably connected to the fact that both radio and fir emissions are related to the sfr of the object . indeed , the radio emission mainly comes from synchrotron radiation of cr electrons accelerated in sn remnants , and the fir flux is mainly due to dust reprocessing of uv photons from young stars . on the other hand , such a tightness of correlation for very different systems has still to be understood .",
    "empirically , the fir - radio correlation can be written as : q_ir=_10 where @xmath28 has been found , for normal galaxies at @xmath29 m , to be @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the fir - radio correlation in samples of faint star - forming dwarf galaxies , finding good agreement with the @xmath31 value of @xcite .",
    "however , it is not guaranteed that such relation holds also in the case of old dsph galaxies considered here . on the other hand , by assuming it , we can use the bounds we derived for the total radio flux to infer bounds on the infrared emission .",
    "they are reported in table [ table : det ] , where we use a spectral index of @xmath32 to scale results at 2 ghz to 1.4 ghz , which leads to @xmath33 .",
    "the peak of the synchrotron emission at 2 ghz is produced by electrons with energy from few gev to few tens of gev , depending on the magnetic field .",
    "the same population of non - thermal electrons inevitably gives rise to ic radiation via their interaction with the cmb photons .",
    "such emission falls in the x - ray frequency range , namely in the kev - mev energy band .",
    "indeed the peak of this ic emission occurs for a photon energy @xmath34 kev , where @xmath35 is the electron energy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : n0vsrs ] , we compare the bounds that can be obtained on the non - thermal electron density from current x - ray data with the constraints derived in this work . for the former",
    ", we consider the analysis of @xcite , which made use of xmm - newton archival data for the carina and fornax dsph targets ( on top of ursa minor which however is not part of our dsph sample ) .",
    "the derived flux limits in the 0.5 - 8 kev band are , respectively , @xmath36 and @xmath37 photons @xmath38 s@xmath39 for an aperture of 6 radius  @xcite . following this analysis , we can constrain @xmath40 for the models discussed above .",
    "we found that x - ray bounds are few orders of magnitude weaker than the constraints from synchrotron emission derived in this work . in fig .",
    "[ fig : n0vsrs ] , we compare x - ray ( upper curves ) and radio ( lower curves ) bounds in the case of a power - law spectrum with @xmath41 for the equilibrium electron distribution .",
    "the radio data of this project are more constraining than current x - ray data for a magnetic field strength larger than @xmath42 g .",
    "local group dsph galaxies are our closest neighbours .",
    "the knowledge about dsphs is however quite limited , as these objects are small , quiescent and dim .",
    "dsphs have been recognized as important probes for cosmology .",
    "their structure , chemical composition and kinematics pose indeed important challenges to our current understanding of structure formation  @xcite .",
    "in addition , dsphs can also be key probes in the search for a particle dm signature ( see paper iii ) .    at present , no evidence for the presence of a thermal or non - thermal plasma from dsphs has been reported in the literature .",
    "deep observations are thus required in order to possibly probe the non - thermal emission associated with particle dm or to the very - low level of dsph sf .    in this paper , we made use of deep mosaic radio observations of a sample of six local dsphs , three  classical \" ones ( carina , fornax , and sculptor ) , and three  ultra - faint \" dsphs ( bootesii , segue2 , and hercules ) to investigate the presence of diffuse synchrotron emissions in the dsph interstellar medium .",
    "we collected data with the atca telescope in an array configuration specifically designed to seek an extended ( few arcmin - scale ) signal .",
    "the resulting maps have a sensitivity around 0.05 mjy at 2 ghz . on top of the image from the compact array , we simultaneously obtained long - baseline data to map discrete sources ( see paper i for more details ) .",
    "the confusion limit is one of the greatest obstacles to be overcome in the search for a few - arcmin radio diffuse emission . indeed , for arcmin synthesized beams , the nominal confusion level at ghz frequency is around few hundreds of @xmath16jy , so well within current radio - telescope sensitivities .",
    "high - resolution maps and a proper source subtraction are thus required .",
    "we performed an accurate procedure for the subtraction of small - scale sources .",
    "it has been done by subtracting the fourier transform of high - resolution sources from the visibility plane .",
    "this procedure allowed to reduce the confusion noise and to gain a factor of few in sensitivity ( depending on the target and the related quality of data ) .",
    "the sensitivity was brought closer to its nominal rms value , especially in the cases of carina and bootesii .",
    "we also described how to possibly further subtract sources in the image plane by means of the sextractor package  @xcite .    with the study of radio diffuse components in dsphs , we aim at addressing open questions about the dsph environment ( especially for what concerns the magnetic properties ) and its activity and cr acceleration mechanisms .",
    "no significant detection of a diffuse emission has been singled out from the atca data , and this allowed us to constrain a number of dsph properties .",
    "first , we discussed the general bounds that can be obtained from the radial distributions of the observed surface brightness and the noise .",
    "they are approximately at the level of 1 mjy / arcmin@xmath43 and can be straightforwardly exploited to constrain models involving a spherical diffuse emission in the observed dsphs ( including wimp - induced emissions ) .",
    "assuming some general and analytic functional forms , we derived bounds on the dsph total flux and emissivity , presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : stot ] and [ fig : j0 ] .",
    "they are constrained at the level of about 1 mjy and 0.1 mjy / beam , respectively , for a source size of the order of the stellar profile extent ( we remind here that the synthesized beam of the adopted maps is about 1 arcmin@xmath43 ) .",
    "assuming the dominant radio emission in dsphs to be due to synchrotron radiation associated with cr electrons accelerated in processes related to star formation ( the dm interpretation is more extensively discussed in paper iii ) , the sfr of dsphs plays a crucial role in setting the brightness of the emission .",
    "we discussed how to relate both the cr density and the magnetic field strength to the sfr inferred from the observed colour - magnitude diagram in cds ( while for the ultra - faint cases we have to mostly rely on extrapolations ) . although the sensitivity of current observations is above the level of the expected emission , we found that , in the case of cds , the next - generation of radio telescopes could start probing the presence of a sf - induced diffuse synchrotron radiation .",
    "the derived bounds depend on the magnetic field model , see fig .",
    "[ fig : a0vsb0 ] .",
    "it affects both the size of the radiated synchrotron power and the spatial diffusion of cr electrons .",
    "we accurately modelled the cr transport in dsphs by developing a new numerical scheme based on the crank - nicolson algorithm ( described in the appendix ) .",
    "we found that the impact of diffusion on the expected emission from dsphs can be dramatic .",
    "indeed , due to the small size of dsphs and the probable low level of turbulence , cr electrons can in principle escape the dsph before radiating a significant amount of synchrotron power .",
    "future polarization measurements of background sources with the ska will be crucial to understand the magnetic properties of dsphs and to reduce the degree of uncertainty in the expected signal .    for each dsph , we derived limits on the magnetic field strength under the equipartition assumption .",
    "physical arguments suggest a strength of the magnetic field at the level of @xmath16 g ( cds ) or a fraction of @xmath16 g ( uds ) , while the equipartition between cr and magnetic density leads to an upper limit of few @xmath16 g ( see table  [ tableb ] ) .",
    "we also discussed the connection of radio emission to fir and x - ray observations . using the fir - radio correlation observed for star - forming galaxies , we translated the radio upper limits into bounds for the dsph emission at @xmath29 m in table  [ table : det ] .",
    "observations in the x - ray band can probe the ic emission due to scattering with the cmb photons of the same gev - population of electrons possibly producing a synchrotron radiation at ghz - frequency . for a magnetic field strength larger than @xmath42 g , the current radio bounds are however significantly more constraining .",
    "to conclude , we presented the first study dedicated to the systematic search for a diffuse radio emission in dsphs making use of interferometric observations .",
    "in this paper , we have shown this technique to be a relevant strategy to be pursued for addressing the puzzling history of dsphs and the fundamental nature of dm .",

    "[ eq : cntrid ]    this kind of numerical method has been adopted for the solution of the transport equation in the milky way , e.g. , by the publicly available codes galprop  @xcite and dragon  @xcite .",
    "the main differences in our case are that we have a 2d propagation ( in @xmath49 and @xmath45 ) due to the spherical symmetry ( instead of 3d or 4d as for the galaxy ) and we consider a logarithmic scale for the spatial grid . for further details on the stability of the generalization of the above described crank - nicolson scheme to a multidimensional case ,",
    "see , e.g. , the galprop manual .",
    "we apply the so - called adi ( alternating direction implicit ) method , in which the implicit updating scheme is alternately applied to the @xmath49- and @xmath45-operators in turn , keeping the other coordinate fixed .      where we assumed a constant step @xmath51 .",
    "neumann ( dirichlet ) boundary conditions @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) has been set at the center @xmath54 ( farthest boundary @xmath55 ) .",
    "the @xmath50-coefficients at @xmath54 ( i.e. , at @xmath56 very close to the center ) turn out to be @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .      in our runs",
    "we typically start with a large time - step @xmath60 years and perform a number of iterations to obtain a stable solution on this large scale ( more in detail , we stop when the fractional change of @xmath61 in a time @xmath62 is below 0.1% for each point of the grid ) . using such solution as @xmath63 of eq .",
    "[ eq : cntrid ] , we then reduce @xmath62 by a factor of 2 and iterate again .",
    "this is repeated until @xmath64 years is reached ( which is a time - step much smaller than any time - scales of the process , in particular of energy losses ) , where we get our final solution . the convergence is ensured by requiring @xmath61 to become constant in time and the time - scale @xmath65 to be larger than diffusive and energy loss times - scales at each grid - point ( typically @xmath66 years ) .",
    "we also cross - checked our numerical solution against analytic solutions in the cases with only spatial - diffusion terms and with only the energy - loss term , and against the semi - analytic solution which makes use of green s functions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) for the full equation but with spatially constant @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the advantages of the crank - nicolson solution with respect to the latter is given by the much shorter computational time needed and by the possibility of having @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "<S> we observed the dsph fields with both a compact array and long baselines . </S>",
    "<S> short spacings led to a synthesized beam of about 1 arcmin and were used for the extended emission search . </S>",

    "<S> we found no significant detection of a diffuse radio continuum component . </S>",
    "<S> after a detailed discussion on the modelling of the cosmic - ray ( cr ) electron distribution and on the dsph magnetic properties , we present bounds on several physical quantities related to the dsphs , such that the total radio flux , the angular shape of the radio emissivity , the equipartition magnetic field , and the injection and equilibrium distributions of cr electrons . finally , we discuss the connection to far - infrared and x - ray observations .    </S>",
