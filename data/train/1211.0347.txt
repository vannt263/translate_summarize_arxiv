    "the rapid rotation of a pulsar s magnetosphere gives rise to strong electric fields , particle acceleration and pulsed radiation across the whole em spectrum .",
    "pulsar wind and associated radiation can fill a substantial volume in the vicinity of a pulsar and be observable throughout the em spectrum as a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ; for recent reviews of pwne see ) .",
    "the termination shock , where bulk flow kinetic energy is converted into internal energy of the plasma , is resolved for the case of the crab nebula ( and some other pwne ) as the inner edge of the torus seen in x - rays @xcite .",
    "in addition to toroidal structures , many pwne exhibit jets which are believed to be outflows along the pulsar s spin axis @xcite .",
    "the formation , confinement and structure of jets are still poorly understood , particularly for pulsar jets , which are very different from agn , x - ray binary and protostellar jets in some respects ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the proximity of the vela pwn offers a unique opportunity to carry out a detailed , time - resolved study of jet dynamics on timescales of months .",
    "such studies can shed new light on jet physics in general , but they are impossible to perform for agns jets , which are the most commonly discussed examples of magnetized mhd outflows .",
    "the vela pulsar is a young ( pulsation period @xmath0ms and spin - down age @xmath1kyr ) , energetic pulsar located at a distance @xmath2pc .",
    "the pulsar is famous for its @xmath3-ray brightness @xcite and glitching behavior @xcite .",
    "the latter was considered strong evidence of superfluidity in the pulsar core @xcite .",
    "the vela pulsar powers the nearest bright x - ray pwn , with a puzzling double - arc structure @xcite .",
    "previous x - ray observations with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( ) led to the discovery of the pulsar s outer jet ( beyond the arcs , in the direction of the proper motion ) , which is faint compared to the inner nebula , and has a peculiar curved morphology @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the read - out streak , the chip gaps , and the suboptimal cadence hampered modeling of the outflow dynamics . here",
    "we present more recent follow - up observations ( 3 images in 2009 and 8 in 2010 , a total of @xmath4440ks of new data ) , with each image twice as deep as in the previous observations . in this letter",
    "we report the first results of these observations .",
    "we observed the vela nebula with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) aboard _",
    "three observations were performed in july 2009 and eight in june - september 2010 .",
    "each observation had an exposure time of about 40ks , and the intervals between successive observations were about a week .",
    "the faint telemetry mode , with a frame time of 3.24s , was used with the target imaged on the back - illuminated s3 chip . the read - out streak ( caused by the bright pulsar )",
    "did not overlap with the jet .",
    "we applied standard filtering to the recorded events and ignored energies outside the 0.58kev band .",
    "the sequence of the resultant images is shown in figure [ pics]-[pics2 ] .",
    "the jet in the direction of the pulsar proper motion ( northwest ) has two components : the bright _ inner _ jet , which extends for @xmath5 from the pulsar up to the outer arc of the pwn , and the _ outer _ jet , which is much fainter but extends further for another @xmath6 . for brevity , hereafter we will refer to the outer northwest ( nw ) jet as `` the jet '' unless it causes ambiguity . with new deeper images ( compared to those in @xcite ) , the fainter emission filling the jet is clearly seen in addition to the brighter knots ( see figures  [ pics ] and [ pics2 ] ) . despite the changing shape , the jet as a whole remains confined to a fairly well defined region ( jet `` envelope '' ) , which is initially narrow and pointing in the direction of the pulsar s proper motion ( as does the inner jet ) , but then gradually bends towards the southwest ( sw ) at greater distances from the pulsar ( see figures 1 and 2 , blue curves ; also below ) .    the jet shape and dynamics ( see figures 1 and 2 and the corresponding animation ) strikingly resemble that of a rotating helix projected on the sky .",
    "the successive positions of the knots detected within the jet in several images , do not appear to have a large velocity component transverse to the jet but rather move approximately radially away from the pulsar .",
    "the brighter inner jet does not show nearly as much motion as the outer jet .",
    "however , the point at which the outer jet emerges beyond the outer arc ( see @xcite for definitions ) changes position with time , moving back and forth along the outer arc edge .",
    "this remarkable phenomenology prompted us to explore a simple geometrical model where a small perturbation , which initially occurs close to the base of the jet , propagates ballistically and grows with the distance from the pulsar resulting in a three - dimensional helix , which we view projected onto the sky .    in our model",
    "we adopt the geometric orientation suggested by @xcite , which implies that the angle between the axis of the inner jet ( the latter is directed along the pulsar s spin axis and the proper motion direction ) and the line - of - sight ( los , normal to the sky ) is 53 , with the inner jet pointed away from the observer ( i.e. , behind the plane of the sky ) . the ballistic motion of the material in the ( outer ) jet is gradually modified due to the global bending of the jet ( discussed by @xcite ; see also the dashed blue curve in figures  1 and 2 ) .",
    "we require the helix to be confined within a bent envelope ( see blue curves in figures  1 and 2 ) , which we define at the outer boundary of the jet emission on the sky , from the sum of all 11 images .",
    "we define the `` guiding '' line as a curve going through the middle of the envelope .",
    "the helix radius increases with distance from the pulsar ( forming a cone with opening half - angle 5@xmath7 , as measured from the pulsar ) .",
    "the helix and its trace ( projection ) on the sky were constructed in the following way .",
    "the helix was defined parametrically using a rotating vector and a moving circle . at each point along the guiding line ( dashed blue curve in figures 1 and 2 ) we defined a circle in a plane locally orthogonal to the guiding line .",
    "the circle radii are increasing with distance from the pulsar , so that each of the circles meets the jet envelope ( dotted curves in figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "for each circle we drew a vector from the circle s center to a point on the circle .",
    "we then rotated these vectors in their circle planes so that the azimuthal angle ( in the circle plane ) changes linearly with the distance from the pulsar .",
    "the endpoints of these vectors trace a 3-dimensional helix , which we projected onto the sky .",
    "the dynamics was introduced by having the azimuthal angle of the first vector ( near the pulsar ) change linearly with time , completing one turn in time @xmath8 .",
    "thus , by construction , in our model the speed of a helical pattern is constant , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the helix pitch ( the distance between successive turns of the helix ) .    as a next step",
    ", we fitted our dynamical model to the image series by varying @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and the initial azimuthal angle of the vector near the pulsar ( which sets the jet `` launching '' direction at a given time ) .",
    "the model parameters were optimized to maximize the number of photons falling in a 3pix - wide stripe along the trace .",
    "the best match to the data corresponds to the stripe containing @xmath11 extra counts ( @xmath44200 counts total ) compared to the average value for randomly chosen parameters ( @xmath12 counts total ) . to obtain the most conservative estimate of this significance we performed extensive monte - carlo simulations .",
    "in particular we simulated the jet shapes for 50@xmath13200d and 0.1@xmath140.3ly and any initial azimuthal angle , which are also the ranges we used in our best - fit search .",
    "the simulations resulted in 10000 realizations for the jet shape .",
    "we then calculated the ratio of the number of realizations where the jet s trace intercepts @xmath154200 photons to the total number of mc realizations .",
    "this resulted in the chance coincidence probability of 0.4% which corresponds to @xmath16 significance .",
    "a simplistic estimate based on poisson counting statistics leads to larger significance . because the data consist of two series with about a one - year gap in - between , there is strong aliasing in the goodness - of - fit measure as a function of @xmath8 , resulting in several acceptable periods , @xmath17d .",
    "we repeated this analysis including older observations from 2000 - 2002 .",
    "the monte - carlo significance did not improve , but one of the above solutions was preferred above the others : @xmath18ly ( corresponding to a projected angular distance of 40@xmath19 on the sky ) and @xmath20d ( @xmath43cycles / year ) , implying @xmath21yr@xmath22yr = @xmath23 .",
    "this flow speed is in agreement with the earlier estimates of the apparent speed of individual knots in the jet , @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "we have sketched the helical trace corresponding to the best fit on the images in figures [ pics ] and [ pics2 ] ( green curves ) .",
    "the model described in section 3 appears to provide a simple description of the observed jet geometry and dynamics . according to our model ,",
    "the flow of particles is _ ballistic _ : the bulk velocity is predominantly radial ( away from the pulsar ) in the direction defined by its launching angle , and the helix arises only from the steady change of that launching direction ( similar to a rotary garden sprinkler ) . indeed , the individual knots within the jet appear to move away from the pulsar radially , rather than following the helical shape of the jet ( figures 1 and 2 ) . below we discuss the implications of a helical structure produced by a ballistic flow .",
    "helical patterns are often seen in agn jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , protostars ( e.g. , @xcite ) and accreting binary systems ( ss443 ; @xcite ) . among the possible mechanisms leading to a helical structure ,",
    "the most frequently mentioned are the helical instability mode in a magnetized plasma column ( the ` kink ' instability ; @xcite and references therein ) or jet precession @xcite .",
    "perhaps the clearest example of a galactic helical jet is that of the micro - quasar ss 433 , where the shape of the jet has been explained as the motion of a matter stream ejected from a precessing nozzle located in the vicinity of the compact object @xcite .",
    "precession in this latter case is torque - driven through the interaction of the compact object with its binary companion . also in agn jet models involving precession , the precession is torque - driven via interactions between the accretor and the accretion disk .",
    "an alternative magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) instability scenario @xcite does not require any external force : rather , the helical pattern grows from a small perturbation which may be any random fluctuation . for the jet of the vela pulsar ( which lacks any evidence of accretion or a companion ) , we consider two mechanisms which could give rise to helical structure : free precession ( i.e. , without external torque ) , and a kink mhd instability in the jet flow . whilst the first is conceptually simple , requiring only oblateness of the pulsar ,",
    "its existence has not yet been established in any pulsar ( although several claims have been made , see below ) .",
    "the latter option has undergone extensive theoretical and numerical investigations for agn jets , but not pulsar jets , whose properties are different .",
    "moreover , the two mechanisms need not be mutually exclusive because the initial small perturbation in the jet flow can be caused by precession and then be amplified via kink instability .",
    "the mechanism responsible for pulsar jet formation is a matter of debate .",
    "if the jets are formed at a relatively large distances from a pulsar , e.g. , via a magnetically channeled backflow of particles from the equatorial post - shock region , then one might expect the effects of a free precession on a jet be somewhat washed out . on the other hand , it is possible that despite the presence of the backflow at larger distances , the jet is actually formed much closer to the pulsar @xcite and then the impact of precession on the jet s behavior would be more pronounced",
    ".      the vela pulsar spin axis may be freely precessing with the period we measured for the jet from our model , in which case the jet is simply launched ballistically along the spin axis .",
    "previous hints of free precession in pulsars have been reported , based on ( quasi-)periodic changes in pulsar spectra , pulse profiles or timing residuals .",
    "the periodic signature seen in psr b1828@xmath2511 was interpreted as precession @xcite , but after ten years of further observation , this interpretation has not been confirmed .",
    "the varying x - ray flux of the isolated neutron star rx j0720.4@xmath253125 was suggested to be due to precession but , again , further observations have failed to firmly establish this conclusion ; the periodic flux variations could plausibly be caused by effects other than precession @xcite .",
    ", commenting on the putative precession of psr b1828@xmath2511 , argued for a relationship between the precession period @xmath8 and the pulsar spin period @xmath26 as @xmath27 , which would predict @xmath28d for vela .",
    "similarly , @xcite measured the periodic modulations of several pulsars , finding a correlation between the long - term period and the pulse period , which could be ascribed to precession .",
    "periods in the 80200d range are predicted for a pulsar with @xmath26=89ms ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is conceivable that the helical shape of the vela pulsar jet could be due to free precession .",
    "if the vela pulsar is indeed precessing , long - term timing in radio may be able to detect it @xcite , but such detections are complicated by glitching . if precession is confirmed for the vela pulsar , it should be present in other pulsars as well .",
    "interestingly , recent analysis by @xcite shows that the crab pulsar jet also has a corkscrew structure which evolves with time .",
    "the precession of a pulsar has interesting theoretical implications . for our helical model",
    ", we can infer the stellar oblateness parameter @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are principal moments of inertia ) . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "this imposes a limit on how much of the pulsar mass can be in the superfluid interior .",
    "one might expect the superfuidity to damp any precession effects , but the coupling between crust and core is complex , and the core may partially participate in the precession @xcite . indeed",
    ", suggests that glitching ",
    "exchange of angular momentum between the crust and the core ",
    "can actually be the excitation mechanism for precession .",
    "if so , then it is not surprising that vela , which is such a prolific glitcher , should show the clearest signs of precession .",
    "we would also like to point out that the rest of the bright inner pwn also appears to be variable on a similar timescale .",
    "for example , figure [ diffs ] shows the difference image throughout the 2010 data ( last image of the series minus the first image ) , revealing the changes in the inner arc - like structures and the inner south - eastern jet .",
    "changes , labelled in figure [ diffs ] , can be easily seen .",
    "we defer detailed investigation of the geometric and spectral evolution of the inner nebula for a separate paper .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the only mechanism capable of producing a coordinated ( coherent ) change in the arcs ( likely brightened limbs of the equatorial outflow ; @xcite ) and both jets must be acting at the origin of these outflows ( i.e. at the pulsar ) making the precession a natural candidate .",
    "changes in the vela pwn morphology seen in earlier _ cxo _ images were suggested to be caused by precession @xcite , perhaps related to earlier ( quasi-)periodic timing signatures @xcite , suggesting a precession period of 330d .",
    "we note that the vela pwn model of @xcite assumes that the arcs are `` traces of the particle beams from the two magnetic poles at the shock front '' and the jet is a `` manifestation of a physical flow of particles along the magnetic axis of the star , not along the rotation axis . ''",
    "although their assumptions clearly differ from those in our model ( where the jet is along the pulsar s spin axis ) , the observational implications of the free precession scenario could be similar ( regardless of the specific model for the pwn features ) , such as correlated periodic variability in the pwn structure .",
    "another possible scenario for the observed jet shape and dynamics is the kink instability .",
    "although our helical model has strict periodicity built - in , the model may still approximate , to some extent , the behavior expected due to the kink depending on the nature of the initial perturbation ( which can also be the precession ) .",
    "the mhd helical kink instability is often invoked to interpret the agn jet shapes ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the kink instability in the non - linear regime can produce structures resembling a helix , with current driven , velocity shear driven , or jet precession mechanisms being considered as viable options for driving the kink @xcite .",
    "pulsar jets were discovered relatively recently , their physical properties are still poorly known , and their modeling is still in a nascent state compared to the agn jets .",
    "although the basic mhd principles should probably be applicable to pulsar jets , existing agn jet models may not be directly applicable , because the properties of these systems ( e.g. , baryon loading , bulk lorentz factor , magnetic - to - kinetic energy ratio , jet formation mechanism , jet confinement mechanism ) are likely quite different . even in the linear approximation",
    "the analysis for the local instability modes in pulsar jets critically depends on the poorly known magnetization parameter @xcite .",
    "still , some results from the numerical modeling of agn jets might be useful for qualitative understanding of pulsar jets .",
    "for the mhd instability , we can crudely associate the period in our helical model , @xmath8 , with the characteristic timescale of the appearance of successive kinks ( which will not be truly periodic unless triggered by precession ) . according to the recent mhd simulations done for agn jets by @xcite , the instability growth timescale for the global kink development ( i.e. ,",
    "when the jet resembles a spiral with a radius comparable to the jet radius ) can be crudely estimated as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the jet radius and @xmath34 is the alfvn speed . using the measured jet radius @xmath35 and the alfvn speed estimated for equipartition , @xmath36 @xcite",
    ", we find the instability growth timescale to be @xmath37ds . in the images shown in figures 1 and 2",
    "the distinct helical pattern typically emerges by a distance @xmath38 from the pulsar , which implies the flow velocity @xmath39 assuming that the instability starts at much smaller distance from the pulsar than @xmath40 .",
    "although the implied flow speed is somewhat higher than the flow speed inferred above and the apparent speeds of the knots ( pavlov et al .",
    "2003 ) , these are consistent given the uncertainties involved , which support the above - described scenario , if the jet s magnetic field strength is near equipartiton .",
    "we note , however , that the jet retained approximately the same helical morphology between the 2010 and 2011 series which corresponds to over 400d . on this substantially larger timescale",
    ", one could expect to see highly nonlinear instability development , leading to the jet disruption .",
    "however , with the data available we can not tell whether the jet shape remained stable from 2009 to 2010 or if it had disrupted and regrown .",
    "we also note that the extreme bending was observed only once , in the 2000 february image ( see @xcite ) , and it might have been due to a disruptive , highly - developed kink .",
    "the rareness of such events hints at a substantially larger instability timescale than the estimate above . in this case",
    "the origin of the stable helical pattern may be better explained by pure precession . on the other hand",
    ", there may be factors leading to the delay in the nonlinear instability growth , such as the pressure of the ambient medium becoming important far enough from the pulsar . at large distances from the pulsar the jet behavior is also affected by the ram pressure due to the combined action of the pulsar s motion and a strong wind within the snr , possibly caused by the passage of the reverse shock ( pavlov et al .",
    ", 2003 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this ram pressure can explain the clockwise bending of the jet s end and the distortion of the helical structure at large distances from the pulsar .",
    "the vela pulsar system continues to be a fascinating testbed for magnetized outflow models .",
    "it may also become the first ns known to precess freely , if our results are confirmed by further modeling of the inner pwn , by additional x - ray observations , and/or by careful pulsar timing analysis , which we strongly encourage .",
    "if the precession is confirmed , the vela pulsar may become one of the best persistent sources of gravitational waves for the next generation of detectors , given that current detecting technology is most sensitive to signal frequencies @xmath1510hz , and sensitivity is greatly enhanced by searching at a known frequency and position @xcite .",
    "numerical mhd simulations of pulsar jets are also required to make further progress and to reveal the physical conditions in the jet and instability development .    *",
