    "white dwarfs ( wds ) have one of two types of atmospheres : those dominated by hydrogen ( spectral class da ) , and those dominated by helium ( the non - da spectral classes ) .",
    "the ratio of the numbers of da to non - da stars is a function of temperature , culminating in the `` db gap '' , ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "until recently , no he - atmosphere wds were known to exist in this temperature range , though several have now been discovered in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the da to non - da ratio suggests that some he - atmosphere wds must change their atmospheric composition , an effect often ascribed to the diffusion of hydrogen to the surfaces of cooling do stars and the later mixing of this hydrogen veneer into the thicker he - envelope due to the appearance of an atmospheric convection zone @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that even though a few dozen wds are known to exist in open star clusters with turnoff masses greater than 2@xmath5 , no db wds are known in these clusters .",
    "however , this study excludes other wd spectral types with he - dominated atmospheres , such as the dba wd lp  475 - 242 ( wd 0437 + 138 ) , a potential member of the hyades .",
    "@xcite also give only a brief mention of the impact of the db gap without calculating the impact of the changing da to non - da ratio in this temperature range .",
    "subsequent to their publication , analysis of the sdss dr4 wd sample @xcite has found that the da to non - da ratio is larger than the value of 3.5 used in @xcite , warranting a re - analysis of the cluster non - da deficiency .    in this letter , we report the discovery of a hot dq ( he - dominated atmosphere with opacity dominated by atomic carbon ) wd in the field of the young open cluster ( messier 35 ) .",
    "several da wds in this cluster have already been identified and characterized @xcite .",
    "the identification of this he - atmosphere wd provides insight into both the origin of dq wds and the apparent deficiency of he - atmosphere wds in open clusters .",
    "we obtained @xmath6  imaging of the open cluster ngc 2168 on ut 2004 january 27 with the mosaic-1 camera on the kitt peak mayall 4-m telescope .",
    "photometry was derived via point - spread function fitting using the daophot ii program @xcite .",
    "we select objects with blue excess as candidate wds as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram for confirmed cluster wds is shown in figure [ fig.cmd ] .",

    "the open diamond in figure [ fig.cmd ] is ( hereafter lawds 28 ) , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and we assign it the @xcite - style designation wd j0608 + 2420 .",
    "this object has a @xmath12-magnitude of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . as its photometric properties ( open diamond in figure [ fig.cmd ] ) are similar to those of known wds in m35 , we selected this object for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "the spectroscopic data were obtained on ut 2005 november 26 using the blue camera of the low - resolution imaging spectrometry on the keck 1 telescope @xcite .",
    "we placed a 1  slit on the object at the parallactic angle and selected the 400 line mm@xmath16 , 3400  blaze grism to obtain a spectral resolution of @xmath17 .",
    "our total exposure time was 4800s , split into four 1200s exposures .",
    "the images were combined and the spectrum was extracted and calibrated ( wavelength and relative flux ) using standard _ iraf _ routines .",
    "the extracted spectrum is peculiar and markedly different from other spectra obtained in our open cluster wd survey , both for confirmed wds ( da , db and dcs ) and the non - wd sample contaminants ( mostly qsos , hot subdwarfs , and field horizontal branch stars ) .",
    "the spectral features are consistent with spectral features , leading us to conclude that this object is a dq wd .    the spectrum for lawds  28 is shown in figure [ fig.spec ] ( top ) , along with the sdss 2.5-m spectrum for ( bottom ) , the object most similar from the sample of hot dq stars showing , , and/or multiplets in @xcite .",
    "the tick marks label the approximate positions of multiplets of taken from @xcite .",
    "included are the weaker multiplets omitted from the plots in @xcite .",
    "both multiplets with strong and weak laboratory intensities appear in lawds 28 ; the 4267  line , often observed to be strong in hot stars , is present in lawds 28 but is not the only dominant feature .",
    "while a case could be made that the sdss object shows additional features , possibly due to in its spectrum , the cluster wd is matched almost perfectly with transitions alone .",
    "it is possible that the strong multiplet near 464751  may contribute weakly , but no or oxygen lines are matched except where they would blend with the .",
    "hot dq wds are thought to have atmospheres dominated by helium .",
    "@xcite analyze the atmospheric abundances of the hot dq ( wd 0203 + 207 ) and find a carbon abundance @xmath18 and a hydrogen abundance of @xmath19 , implying that @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the hot dq ( wd 1727 + 560 ) also was found to have only trace abundances of carbon and hydrogen @xcite .",
    "therefore it is likely that lawds 28 has a he - dominated atmosphere despite showing no evidence for helium features in the spectrum . the lack of such features in many hot dqs is thought to be due to the masking of helium features by the dominant carbon opacity @xcite .",
    "given the lack of a model fit to the spectrum of lawds 28 , it is difficult to determine many fundamental parameters of this wd with precision .",
    "however , the available observations provide a preponderance of evidence that lawds 28 is a hot , massive cluster - member wd .",
    "we now outline this evidence .",
    "the distance and reddening of ngc 2168 are somewhat uncertain .",
    "@xcite adopt @xmath21 from @xcite to derive @xmath22 from @xmath23 photometry , while @xcite calculate @xmath24 and @xmath25 from @xmath26 photometry .",
    "either case leads to an apparent distance modulus @xmath27 . at this distance ,",
    "the absolute magnitude of lawds 28 is @xmath28 ; assuming the @xcite reddening value , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this absolute magnitude is consistent with evolutionary models of da and db wds with @xmath31 and hotter than @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "however , dq photometric indices are likely to differ from those of das and dbs , and in fact the hot dqs in @xcite are bluer in @xmath33 than pure - he atmosphere models .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig.cmd ] , lawds 28 is also bluer than the given db models .",
    "the effective temperature , @xmath34 , of lawds 28 can not be determined accurately , as no spectral models for these hot dqs exist .",
    "the  color of this wd is bluer than any db model from @xcite , though these models are not calculated for @xmath35 . by matching the observed  color to reddened blackbody models calculated using the _ synphot _ package in stsdas @xcite",
    ", we derive a blackbody temperature of @xmath36 .",
    "for the hot dqs in @xcite , sdss colors were converted to a `` pure helium '' effective temperature , @xmath37 , based on colors for pure helium - atmosphere wds with @xmath38 . for sdss j0106 + 1513 , the comparison star shown in figure [ fig.spec ] , @xmath39 , while the dqs and have @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively @xcite .",
    "both of these stars show in addition to in their spectra ; the lack of in the spectrum of lawds 28 would argue that this dq is hotter than the other two . while the continuum slope of sdss j0106 + 1513 is bluer than that of lawds 28",
    ", this does not necessarily mean that lawds 28 is cooler , as the spectra have not been corrected for extinction . since neither the blackbody temperature nor the pure - helium temperatures take the spectral features of the dqs into account , these are only educated guesses as to @xmath34 .",
    "given the very blue colors and the ion ratios , we surmise that lawds 28 is a hot ( @xmath42 ) wd .",
    "we also note that the coolest da wds in ngc 2168 ( similar in  to lawds 28 ) have @xmath43 .",
    "the discovery of a hot dq white dwarf in this young cluster is consistent with the case reiterated in @xcite that such wds may be massive .",
    "@xcite found a high gravity for the hot dq star from their detailed atmospheric analysis and fit to the spectral lines of carbon , hydrogen and helium .",
    "this has been confirmed by a trigonometric parallax measurement @xcite .",
    "a parallax is also available from the same source for the similar field star , the spectrum of which was analyzed by @xcite , and it also appears to have a mass near 1  @xmath5 .",
    "it is expected from theoretical evolutionary calculations of asymptotic giant branch stars that the helium - shell burning consumes a greater fraction of the helium layer with increasing mass @xcite , with further calculations leading to a similar conclusion in @xcite .",
    "a smaller helium envelope as the star enters the white dwarf cooling phase in turn means that dredge - up of carbon ( and perhaps oxygen ) from the edge of the core into the convective envelope and atmosphere should occur at a higher temperature  in the db temperature range , in which lawds  28 apparently is .",
    "if _ all _ hot dq stars are in fact massive , this may account for the absence of massive db stars in the sample of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) ; this is the only large sample of field db stars for which detailed determinations of the relevant parameters ( @xmath34 , @xmath44 , and therefore mass ) are available .",
    "nearly all of these db stars have masses near the canonical peak of 0.6 @xmath5",
    ".    finally , hot dqs are very rare . in the sdss dr4",
    "wd catalog @xcite , only 0.3% ( 28 out of 9316 white dwarfs ) are hot dqs ; with a surface density of approximately one for every 180 square degrees .",
    "we estimate the number of hot white dwarfs in our 0.5 sq .",
    "degree imaging of ngc 2168 by integrating the wd luminosity function from the palomar - green survey @xcite for @xmath45 to a volume corresponding to limiting apparent magnitude of @xmath46 .",
    "this estimate therefore allows for the possibility that lawds 28 is less massive than 1@xmath5 , and therefore brighter and background to ngc 2168 .",
    "the estimated number of intrinsically bright wds in our imaging area is found to be @xmath47 .",
    "if 0.3% of these are hot dqs , we would expect 0.03 hot dqs in our imaging area .",
    "thus , the likelihood that lawds 28 is an interloping field dq in our 0.5 square degree field of view is extremely low .",
    "however , until a distance modulus or proper motion can be determined for lawds 28 , some uncertainty about its membership will remain .    in summary ,",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic data for lawds 28 are consistent with it being a hot ( @xmath48 ) , massive ( @xmath49 ) wd located at the distance of ngc 2168 . until an accurate model atmosphere can be fit to the data or until proper motion information is available , it is not possible to state _ conclusively _ that lawds 28 is a member of ngc 2168 .      _",
    "lp  475 - 242 .",
    " _ lp 475 - 242 ( wd 0437 + 138 ) is a dba white dwarf about one core radius ( 3 pc ) from the hyades cluster center .",
    "@xcite fits its spectrum to get @xmath50 and @xmath51 , suggesting a modestly above - average mass ( @xmath52 ) for a db white dwarf .",
    "hydrogen lines were included to get a trace hydrogen abundance of @xmath53 , so the atmosphere is clearly he - dominated .",
    "this wd has been used in some cluster data compilations to determine the initial - final mass relation , most recently that of @xcite .",
    "lp 475 - 242 was listed by @xcite as a possible white dwarf member of the hyades on the basis of its proper motion , faint magnitude , and blue color .",
    "@xcite determined a photometric parallax of 0023 , in close agreement with the hyades distance . @xcite and @xcite consider lp 475 - 242 to be an established hyades member .",
    "accurate proper motion measurements ( table [ tab.pm ] ) agree almost exactly , in size and direction , with motion expected for a hyades member .",
    "finally , under the assumption that lp 475 - 242 is at the systemic velocity of the hyades , the resulting gravitational redshift leads to a mass of @xmath54 @xcite , consistent with the spectroscopic mass @xcite and with the masses of das in the hyades @xcite .",
    "it therefore seems highly likely that lp 475 - 242 is a hyades member .",
    "_ lb 3600 . ",
    "_ it is also possible that a third cluster db is already known , in @xcite .",
    "based on their spectral fits , this wd is about one magnitude too bright to be a member of m67 , though their spectrum is very noisy , and db spectra are difficult to fit with precision . as the deficiency of open cluster dbs noted by @xcite was specifically for clusters with main - sequence turnoff masses @xmath55 and the m67 turnoff mass is @xmath56 , we do not consider this object in our analysis below .",
    "@xcite note the lack of db wds in open clusters .",
    "though there are no known `` pure '' db wds in open clusters , this overlooks the physical reality that non - da spectral types in the db temperature range  dbs , dbas , dbzs , and hot dqs  have atmospheres dominated by he . as he has a very low opacity , trace contaminants in the atmosphere",
    "can easily dominate the opacity , masking he features . in order to study whether the ratio of hydrogen - dominated atmosphere wds to helium - dominated atmosphere wds differs from star clusters to the field",
    ", these other spectral types should be included in any analysis . given our discovery of lawds 28 , a likely he - dominated atmosphere wd in an open cluster ,",
    "given the probable hyades dba lp  475 - 242 , and given a new determination of the field da : db ratio from sloan digital sky survey data @xcite , we now revisit the issue of the h- to he - atmosphere ratio in open clusters .    _ a new measurement of the field da : db ratio .",
    " _ the large numbers of field wds discovered during the sloan digital sky survey has permitted a new determination of the da : db ratio ( including dbas ) @xcite . for @xmath57 ,",
    "da : db@xmath58 , while for @xmath59 , da : db@xmath60 . because of the near degeneracy of db spectra over the temperature range of @xmath61 , it is difficult to determine the lower @xmath34  boundary of the deficit , though it is most likely in the @xmath62 range .",
    "thus , the `` db - gap '' is really a deficiency , not a complete lack , of wds in the temperature range @xmath63 , somewhat larger than previous estimates of the db gap range . as this is a large , uniform sample of wds , and as the da : db ratio is provided as a function of temperature , we adopt these ratios for calculating the number of expected he - atmosphere wds in the open cluster sample .    _ expected numbers of he - atmosphere wds in the open cluster sample .",
    " _ for the sample of open cluster wds , we use the sample as presented by @xcite .",
    "this work applies stringent membership criteria , so few non - cluster members should contaminate the sample .",
    "we calculate the number of non - da wds using the @xcite da : db ratio in two temperature bins : @xmath64 ( da : db@xmath65 ; 21 open cluster das ) and @xmath66 ( da : db@xmath67 ; 17 das ) .",
    "we thus expect @xmath68 non - da wds in the current open cluster wd sample .",
    "this number assumes that the @xcite da : db ratio would be unaffected by inclusion of non - db and non - dba he - atmosphere wds in the calculations",
    ".    given two probable he - atmosphere cluster wds ( lawds 28 and lp  475 - 242 ) , we use poisson statistics to calculate the likelihood of finding two or fewer non - da wds to be 0.08 .",
    "if only one of these he - atmosphere wds is a cluster member , this probability drops to 0.02 .",
    "this is akin to @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "thus , while the ratio of da to non - da wds in open clusters is low , it is not greatly inconsistent with the expected number . with coming larger samples of open cluster wds , the question of whether the da to non - da ratio in open clusters is the same as that in the field can be addressed with much more certainty",
