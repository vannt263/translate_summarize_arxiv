    "recently , topological insulators ( tis ) have attracted great attention in the fields of condensed matter physics and materials science .",
    "based on the noninteracting band theory , tis have gapped bulk gap and time - reversal symmetry protected metallic helical surface ( edge ) states where spin and momentum are locked together.@xcite these novel physical properties hold great promise in applications of spintronics and quantum computing@xcite and have stimulated both experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "indeed , the field of tis is expanding so rapidly and there have been several excellent review articles on it.@xcite although many tis including alloy@xcite , binary compounds@xcite , ternary compounds@xcite , and quaternary compounds@xcite have already been theoretically predicted and experimentally realized , real materials that can be used in practical engineering are still needed . therefore searching for new tis with a variety of excellent physical properties",
    "has become a central task in this filed . to achieve this goal",
    ", one has to develop an accurate and effective method to distinguish tis from normal insulators .",
    "there are several general methods to determine the band topology of an insulator :    \\(i ) based on the idea of bulk - edge correspondence of tis,@xcite one can calculate surface ( edge ) states for a given insulator and count the number of gapless modes across the fermi level .",
    "an odd number of gapless modes implies a ti while an even number indicates a normal insulator .",
    "this is a straightforward but not efficient way because the surface state dispersion may depend on every detail of the surface , for example , grown directions , terminated chemical elements and surface reconstructions . in some materials , the topologically nontrivial and trivial surface states can coexist , which further complicates the identification of the bulk topological order . to make sure that the gapless modes are topologically protected ,",
    "one has to vary surface crystal structures and see if gapless modes can survive .",
    "furthermore , a huge amount of computational resources is required in first - principles surface calculations .",
    "\\(ii ) it is possible to use adiabatic continuity and so - called band inversion mechanism to identify tis.@xcite the adiabatic continuity can be realized by artificially changing some external parameter such as the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) strength or lattice constant .",
    "suppose the unknown state is near some known topological trivial or nontrivial states in a parameter space .",
    "if one tunes the parameter and the band gap stays open until it reaches the known state , then by the principle of adiabatic continuity , these two states share the same topological classification .",
    "otherwise , the unknown state and known state may have different topological classifications if the band gap closes .",
    "obviously , many intermediate calculations are required , making it a very tedious work .",
    "band inversion at high - symmetry points within the brillouin zone ( bz ) , as an empirical rule , can also be used to reveal the band topology .",
    "although this empirical rule is adapted in some materials , such as half - heusler@xcite , chalcogenide@xcite , and chalcopyrite@xcite compounds , it is not an universal way for arbitrary systems .",
    "\\(iii ) the most general and direct approach is to calculate @xmath0 topological invariants from the knowledge of bloch band theory.@xcite for materials with both time - reversal and spatial inversion symmetry ( centrosymmetric systems ) , the simple parity criterion developed by fu and kane@xcite have been applied in a number of works.@xcite on the other hand , if the spatial inversion symmetry is absent ( noncentrosymmetric systems ) , one must resort to a more complex method to evaluate @xmath0 invariants.@xcite within a tight - binding framework , fukui and hatsugai@xcite have developed an effective algorithm to compute @xmath0 invariants in terms of the berry gauge potential and the berry curvature@xcite associated with the bloch functions ( bfs ) .",
    "this method has already been implemented in our first - principles codes and successfully predicted three - dimensional ( 3d ) tis in ternary half - heusler@xcite and chalcopyrite@xcite compounds and two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) in silicene.@xcite recently there appears another method which is in the same spirit of ref . but employs the charge center of wannier functions.@xcite    in this work , we illustrate the detailed implementation of first - principles calculations of topological invariants @xmath0 in both centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric systems within the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( fp - lapw ) formalism . although the latter method for noncentrosymmetric systems can be applied to centrosymmetric systems , the parity criterion for centrosymmetric systems is a simpler and quicker way to determine the band topology .",
    "for this reason , we here introduce both of these methods .",
    "it should be emphasized that our methods are standard post - process after ground state wavefunctions are obtained in self - consistent calculation , so the calculation of @xmath0 invariants becomes a routine task just like band structures and density of states .",
    "additionally , we have already paralleled our first - principles codes to speed up the calculation .",
    "our implementation of the calculation of @xmath0 invariants is expected to be an efficient way for searching new tis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the fundamental expression of bfs within fp - lapw formalism and the construction of overlap matrix , and then give the detailed formalism for implementation of parity analysis in centrosymmetric systems and lattice calculation of @xmath0 invariants in noncentrosymmetric systems . in sec .",
    "iii , we take centrosymmetric compounds bi@xmath1se@xmath2 and sb@xmath1se@xmath2 and noncentrosymmetric compounds luptbi , autls@xmath1 and cdsnas@xmath1 to illustrate the efficiency of our methods . finally , we give a brief summary of our work in sec .",

    "a , we provide details on the overlap matrix and its derivatives .",
    "in this section , we start by reviewing the formalism of bfs within fp - lapw formalism and the construction of overlap matrix,@xcite then illustrate the calculation of @xmath0 invariants in both centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric systems .",
    "the key is to calculate the eigenvalues of parity operator according to parity criterion @xcite ( in the former case ) or the overlap matrices related to time - reversal operator @xcite ( in the latter case ) .      in the case of soc , we consider bfs with two components ,    @xmath3,\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 refer to the up and down component of spin .",

    "<S> , one can use the parity analysis of bloch functions at time - reversal invariant momenta to determine the @xmath0 invariants . in systems without spatial inversion symmetry ( noncentrosymmetric ) , however , a more complex and systematic method in terms of the berry gauge potential and the berry curvature is required to identify the band topology . </S>",
