    "apart from predicting a light higgs boson and describing the low energy experimental data very well , the susy models are able to solve various theoretical problems , e.g. , the susy models may provide an elegant way to construct the huge hierarchy between the electroweak symmetry breaking(ewsb ) scale and the grand unification scale . at present the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm)@xcite",

    "the direct evidence for the top - quark was presented in 1995 by the cdf and d0 collaborations of the fermilab tevatron@xcite .",
    "this is considered to be a remarkable success of the sm . from that time on the top physics program has been turned to precise investigation for its properties .",
    "since the top quark is the heaviest particle in the sm detected until now , it plays a special role in the mechanism of the ewsb , and the new physics connected to the ewsb may be found firstly through precise study of top - quark observables .",
    "the high accumulated top - quark events at the cern lhc will open a new , rich field of top - quark phenomenology .",
    "deviations of experimental measurements from the sm predictions , would indicate new non - standard top production or decay mechanisms .",
    "therefore , the precise study of the top properties is one of the urgent priorities of the high energy experimental program .    beside the susy particle direct production , virtual effects of susy particles may induce deviations on observables from the sm predictions .",
    "if susy particles are really detected at the lhc , the comparison of precisely measured top - quark observables with the theoretical predictions including susy loop effects may yield additional information about the underlying model .",
    "therefore , probing precisely the properties of the top - quark is an important goal at the lhc . in order to study precisely the top - quark physics within the sm and beyond at the lhc ,",

    "the @xmath12 production channel has an outstanding advantage over @xmath11 process in measuring @xmath13 coupling at the ilc , due to its relatively larger production rate@xcite .",
    "the nlo susy qcd corrections to the @xmath12 process at linear colliders , and the nlo sm qcd corrections to the @xmath14 production at the lhc are studied in refs.@xcite and @xcite , respectively .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the production of the top - quark pair associated with a @xmath6 boson at the cern lhc in both the leading - order(lo ) and nlo qcd approximations in the framework of the mssm with cp - conservation or cp - violation , and investigate the possible cp - violating effects contributed by the cp - phase in the couplings of gluino - stop - top predicted by the cp - violating mssm .",
