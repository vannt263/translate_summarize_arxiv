    "in the _ traveling salesman problem _ ( tsp ) , the input consists of a set @xmath10 of _ cities _ together with the distances @xmath11 between every pair of distinct cities @xmath12 .",
    "the goal is to find an ordering or _",
    "tour _ of the cities that minimizes ( minimum tsp ) or maximizes ( maximum tsp ) the total tour length . here",
    "the length of a tour @xmath13 is @xmath14    like the minimum tsp , the maximum tsp is np - complete on graphs , even if the triangle inequality holds . after 25 years , the best known performance guarantee for the metric minimum tsp is still christofides s 3/2 approximation algorithm ; the results of arora , lund , motwani , sudan , and szegedy  @xcite show that the problem can not be approximated arbitrarily well , combined with results by papadimitriou and yannakakis  @xcite , it follows that this holds even for the special class of instances where all distances are 1 or 2 .",
    "there has been more development on approximation algorithms for the metric maximum tsp : recently , hassin and rubinstein  @xcite have given a 7/8 approximation algorithm .",
    "of particular interest are _ geometric _ instances of the tsp , in which cities correspond to points in @xmath0 for some @xmath15 , and distances are computed according to some geometric norm .",
    "perhaps the most popular norms are the rectilinear , euclidean , and sup norms .",
    "these are examples of what is known as an `` @xmath16 norm '' for @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . in general",
    ", the distance between two points @xmath20 and @xmath21 under the @xmath16 norm , @xmath22 , is @xmath23 with the natural asymptotic interpretation that distance under the @xmath24 norm is @xmath25 this paper considers a second class of norms which also includes the rectilinear and sup norms , but can only approximate the euclidean and other @xmath16 norms .",
    "this is the class of _ polyhedral norms_. each polyhedral norm is determined by a _ unit ball _ which is a centrally - symmetric polyhedron @xmath26 with the origin at its center . to determine @xmath27 under such a norm ,",
    "first translate the space so that one of the points , say @xmath28 , is at the origin",
    ". then determine the unique factor @xmath29 by which one must rescale @xmath26 ( expanding if @xmath30 , shrinking if @xmath31 ) so that the other point ( @xmath32 ) is on the boundary of the polyhedron .",
    "we then have @xmath33 .    alternatively , and more usefully for our purposes",
    ", we can view a polyhedral norm as follows . if @xmath26 is a polyhedron as described above and has @xmath3 facets , then @xmath3 is divisible by 2 and there is a set @xmath34 of points in @xmath0 such that @xmath26 is the intersection of a collection of half - spaces determined by @xmath35 : @xmath36 then we have @xmath37 note that for the rectilinear norm in the plane we can take @xmath35 = @xmath38 and for the sup norm in the plane we can take @xmath35 = @xmath39 .    for the minimum tsp on geometric instances , two key complexity questions have been answered . as follows from results of itai , papadimitriou , and swarcfiter @xcite , the minimum tsp is np - hard for any fixed dimension @xmath1 and any @xmath16 or polyhedral norm",
    "; see also the earlier results by garey , graham , and johnson  @xcite , and papadimitriou  @xcite . on the other hand , results of arora @xcite and mitchell @xcite",
    "imply that in all these cases a polynomial - time approximation scheme ( ptas ) exists , i.e. , a sequence of polynomial - time algorithms @xmath40 , @xmath41 , where @xmath40 is guaranteed to find a tour whose length is within a ratio of @xmath42 of optimal .",
    "the situation for geometric versions of the maximum tsp has been less clear than for its minimum counterpart .",
    "serdyukov  @xcite , and , independently , barvinok @xcite , have shown that once again polynomial - time approximation schemes exist for all fixed dimensions @xmath1 and all @xmath16 or polyhedral norms ( and in a sense for _ any _ fixed norm ; see @xcite ) .",
    "until now , however , the complexity of the optimization problems themselves when @xmath1 is fixed has remained open : for no fixed dimension @xmath1 and @xmath16 or polyhedral norm was the problem of determining the maximum tour length known either to be np - hard or to be polynomial - time solvable . in this paper , we resolve the question for all polyhedral norms , showing that , in contrast to the case for the minimum tsp , the maximum tsp is solvable in polynomial time for any fixed dimension @xmath1 and any polyhedral norm :    [ th : main ] let dimension @xmath1 be fixed , and let @xmath43 be a fixed polyhedral norm in @xmath0 whose unit ball is a centrally symmetric polyhedron @xmath26 determined by a set of @xmath3 facets .",
    "then for any set of @xmath44 points in @xmath0 , one can construct a traveling salesman tour of maximum length with respect to @xmath43 in time @xmath2 in the real number ram model , where arithmetic operations take unit time and only addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division are allowed .",
    "a similar result also holds for polyhedral _ quasi - norms _ , i.e. , asymmetric distance functions that can be defined in terms of `` unit balls '' that are non - symmetric polyhedra containing the origin .",
    "these can again be characterized by a set of vectors @xmath45 , but now we need a vector for each facet of the polyhedron and @xmath46 .",
    "serdyukov @xcite previously showed that for the case of a quasi - norm in @xmath47 with a triangle as the unit ball , the maximum tsp can be solved in polynomial time . with our techniques",
    "we can show the following analog of theorem [ th : main ] .",
    "[ th : quasi ] let dimension @xmath1 be fixed , and let @xmath43 be a fixed polyhedral quasi - norm in @xmath0 whose unit ball is a polyhedron @xmath26 determined by a set of @xmath3 facets .",
    "then for any set of @xmath44 points in @xmath0 , one can construct a traveling salesman tour of maximum length with respect to @xmath43 in time @xmath5 in the real number ram model .    as an immediate consequence of theorem [ th : main ]",
    ", we get relatively efficient algorithms for the maximum tsp in the plane under rectilinear and sup norms , with a complexity of @xmath4 .",
    "the restriction to the real number ram model in theorem [ th : main ] is made primarily to simplify the statements of the conclusions .",
    "suppose on the other hand that one assumes , as one typically must for complexity theory results , that the components of the vectors in @xmath48 and the coordinates of the cities are all rationals .",
    "let @xmath49 denote the maximum absolute value of any of the corresponding numerators and denominators .",
    "then the conclusions of the theorem hold for the standard logarithmic cost ram model with running times multiplied by @xmath50 .",
    "if the components / coordinates are all integers with maximum absolute value @xmath49 , the running times need only be multiplied by @xmath51 . for simplicity in the remainder of this paper , we shall stick to the model in which numbers can be arbitrary reals and arithmetic operations take unit time .",
    "the reader should have no trouble deriving the above variants .",
    "the above results make use of a polynomial solution method for the following tsp variant , which may be of independent interest : when visiting a given set of @xmath44 cities , all connections have to be made via a set of @xmath52 hubs , where @xmath52 is a constant .",
    "the complexity of @xmath4 for the scenario of planar rectilinear distances can be improved by using special geometric properties of this case .",
    "we can show the following optimal running time :    [ th : linear ] the maximum tsp for points in @xmath47 under the @xmath53 norm can be solved in @xmath7 time .",
    "by appropriate coordinate transformation , this result can be generalized to all planar polyhedral norms with @xmath6 facets , which includes the sup norm .",
    "it holds even in a restricted model of computation , where no indirect addressing may be used , and hence sorting requires @xmath8 time . the main idea behind",
    "the algorithm is to exploit the fact that rectilinear distances in the plane have a high degree of degeneracy . as a consequence",
    ", we can show that the number of optimal tours is very large , @xmath54 , and the set of optimal tours can be described very easily .",
    "this contrasts sharply to the case of euclidean distances , where there may be a single optimal tour .",
    "indeed the complexity of the maximum tsp in @xmath47 under the euclidean metric remains an open question , although we have resolved the question for higher dimensions with the following result .",
    "[ th : nphard ] maximum tsp under euclidean distances in @xmath0 is an np - hard problem if @xmath9 .",
    "one of the consequences is np - hardness of the maximum tsp for polyhedral norms with an unbounded number of facets on the corresponding unit ball .",
    "another consequence concerns the so - called _ maximum scatter tsp _",
    ", where the objective is to find a tour that maximizes the shortest edge .",
    "the maximum scatter tsp was first considered by arkin , chiang , mitchell , skiena , and yang  @xcite , and the complexity for geometric instances was stated as an open problem .",
    "our result implies np - hardness for euclidean instances in 3-dimensional space .",
    "an issue that is still unresolved for the maximum tsp as well as the minimum tsp is the question of whether the tsp under euclidean distances is a member of the class np , allowing polynomial time verification of a good solution .",
    "even if all city coordinates are rationals , we do not know how to compare a tour length to a given rational target in less than exponential time .",
    "such a comparison would appear to require us to evaluate a sum of @xmath44 square roots to some precision , and currently the best upper bound known on the number of bits of precision needed to insure a correct answer remains exponential in @xmath44 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : auxi ] introduces a new special case of the tsp , the _",
    "tunneling tsp_. we show how the maximum tsp under a polyhedral norm can be reduced to the tunneling tsp with the same number of cities and @xmath55 tunnels ( and with @xmath56 tunnels for polyhedral quasi - norms ) .",
    "section  [ subsec : tunnel ] shows how the solutions for the tunneling tsp with a fixed number @xmath57 of tunnels can be characterized , setting up an algorithm with a running time of @xmath58 described in detail in section  [ subsec : speedup ] .",
    "section  [ sec : linear ] describes the linear - time algorithm for rectilinear distances in the plane .",
    "section  [ sec : npc ] gives the np - hardness proof of the maximum traveling salesman problem for euclidean distances in @xmath59 , and a number of higher - dimensional extensions .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] concludes with a brief discussion and open problems .",
    "the _ tunneling tsp _ is a special case of the maximum tsp in which distances are determined by what we shall call a _ tunnel system _ distance function .",
    "in such a distance function we are given a set @xmath60 of @xmath57 auxiliary objects that we shall call _ tunnels_. each tunnel is viewed as a bidirectional passage having a front and a back end .",
    "for each pair @xmath61 of a city and a tunnel we are given real - valued _ access distances _",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 from the city to the front and back ends of the tunnel respectively .",
    "each potential tour edge @xmath64 must pass through some tunnel @xmath65 , either by entering the front end and leaving the back ( for a distance of @xmath66 ) , or by entering the back end and leaving the front ( for a distance of @xmath67 ) .",
    "since we are looking for a tour of maximum length , we can thus define the distance between cities @xmath68 and @xmath69 to be @xmath70 note that this distance function , like our geometric norms , is symmetric .",
    "( as we will see below , we can make adjustments for asymmetric distance functions . )",
    "it is easy to see that maximum tsp remains np - hard when distances are determined by arbitrary tunnel system distance functions .",
    "however , for the case where @xmath71 is fixed and not part of the input , we will show in the next section that maximum tsp can be solved in @xmath58 time .",
    "we are interested in this special case because of the following lemma .",
    "[ le : tunnel ] if @xmath43 is a polyhedral norm determined by a set @xmath48 of @xmath55 vectors in @xmath0 , then for any set @xmath10 of points in @xmath0 one can in time @xmath72 construct a tunnel system distance function with @xmath52 tunnels that yields @xmath73 for all @xmath74 .    *",
    "proof : * the polyhedral distance between two cities @xmath75 is @xmath76 thus we can view the distance function determined by @xmath43 as a tunnel system distance function with set of tunnels @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 for all cities @xmath80 and tunnels @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath82    it is straightforward to extend this characterization to the case of any polyhedral quasi - norm that is characterized by a unit ball with a total of @xmath3 facets .",
    "the only real change is in the complexity of the characterization of the tunnel system in lemma  [ le : tunnel ] .",
    "if we use the definition @xmath83 for possibly asymmetric tunnel distances , then by similar reasoning we get the following :    [ le : quasi.tunnel ] if @xmath43 is a polyhedral quasi - norm determined by a set @xmath48 of @xmath3 vectors in @xmath0 , then for any set @xmath10 of points in @xmath0 one can in time @xmath84 construct a tunnel system distance function with @xmath3 tunnels that yields @xmath85 for all @xmath74 .",
    "in this section we describe an @xmath86 algorithm to solve the tunneling tsp when the number of tunnels is fixed at @xmath52 , assuming the real number ram model . by lemmas [ le : tunnel ] and [",
    "le : quasi.tunnel ] this implies our results for polyhedral norms and quasi - norms ( theorems [ th : main ] and [ th : quasi ] . )",
    "the approach described below also yields a polynomial algorithm for a minimum tsp variant , where a given set of @xmath44 cities has to be traveled , and all connections have to be made via a set of a fixed number @xmath52 of hubs .",
    "we start by characterizing solutions for bounded tunnel systems in section  [ subsec : tunnel ] .",
    "this characterization is the basis for our algorithm , which is described in section  [ subsec : speedup ] . in section  [ subsec : further ] we present an additional idea that may possibly improve the above complexity to @xmath87 .",
    "we start by discussing the solutions for bounded tunnel systems .",
    "suppose we are given an instance of the tunneling tsp with sets @xmath88 and @xmath89 of cities and tunnels , and access distances @xmath62 , @xmath63 for all @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we begin by transforming the problem to one about subset construction .",
    "let @xmath92 be an edge - weighted , bipartite multigraph with four edges between each city @xmath68 and tunnel @xmath65 , denoted by @xmath93 $ ] , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the weights of these edges are @xmath96 ) = f(c , t)$ ] and @xmath97 ) = b(c , t)$ ] , @xmath94 . for notational convenience ,",
    "let us partition the edges in @xmath98 into sets @xmath99",

    "each tour for the tsp instance then corresponds to a subset @xmath101 of @xmath98 that has @xmath102 equal to the tour length and satisfies    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * every city is incident to exactly two edges in @xmath101 . * for each tunnel @xmath91 , @xmath103| = |e ' \\cap e[t , b]|$ ] .",

    "for example , if @xmath104 , and @xmath68 appears immediately before @xmath69 when the tour is traversed starting from @xmath105 , then the edge @xmath106 can be represented by the two edges @xmath107 $ ] and @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "note that there are enough ( city , tunnel ) edges of each type so that all tour edges can be represented , even if a given city uses the same tunnel endpoint for both its tour edges .",
    "also note that if @xmath11 can be realized in more than one way , the multiset @xmath101 will not be unique .",
    "however , any multiset @xmath101 constructed in this fashion will still have @xmath102 equal to the tour length .    on the other hand ,",
    "any set @xmath101 satisfying ( t1 ) ",
    "( t3 ) corresponds to one ( or more ) tours having length at least @xmath102 : let @xmath109 be the set of tunnels @xmath65 with @xmath103| > 0 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath110 is a connected graph all of whose vertex degrees are even by ( t1 )  ( t3 ) . by an easy result from graph theory ,",
    "this means that @xmath111 contains an euler tour that by ( t1 ) passes through each city exactly once , thus inducing a tsp tour for @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , by ( t2 ) one can construct such an euler tour with the additional property that if @xmath112 $ ] and @xmath113 $ ] are consecutive edges in this tour , then @xmath114 , i.e , either @xmath115 or @xmath116 .",
    "thus we will have @xmath117)+w(e_j[c',t , y ] ) \\leq d(c , c')$ ] , and hence the length of the tsp tour will be at least @xmath102 , as claimed .    in summary ,",
    "our problem is reduced to finding a maximum weight set of edges @xmath118 satisfying ( t1 )  ( t3 ) .        from the previous section we know that our problem is reduced to finding a maximum weight set of edges @xmath119 satisfying ( t1 )  ( t3 ) . given that @xmath52 is fixed , we will first show how to decompose the problem into @xmath120 instances , and then demonstrate how to solve each one of them in @xmath121 time .",

    "therefore there is an optimal solution to the linear program for each integer value of @xmath141 in which all variables are integer .",

    "viewing @xmath141 as a ( real ) parameter , we note that @xmath180 , the optimal objective value of the above transportation problem , is a concave function of @xmath141 . to see this , observe that if @xmath181 are legal values for @xmath141 , and @xmath182 and @xmath183 are the optimal solutions for these two values viewed as vectors of variable values , then @xmath184 is a feasible solution for @xmath185 and so @xmath186 .",
    "thus , we can apply a fibonacci search over the integers @xmath187 , or alternatively perform a binary search , at each step checking the values at @xmath188 , @xmath1 , and @xmath189 .",

    ".    therefore , in time @xmath192 we can determine the set of identifiers for the transportation problem that yields the maximum solution value ( including the full degree sequence for the tunnels ) .",
    "this solution value will be the length of the maximum length tour , but because we were solving the dual rather than primal lp s , we wo nt yet have the optimal tour itself .",
    "for this , we need only solve the optimal transportation problem directly in its primal form .",
    "since the number of tunnels is bounded , we can do this in deterministic time @xmath7 using an algorithm described in an unpublished paper by matsui  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to apply complementary slackness properties to the already computed dual solution variables to reduce the problem to a network flow problem for a bounded number of sinks .",
    "this can then be solved in linear time using an algorithm of of gusfield , martel and fernandez - baca  @xcite ( see also ahuja , orlin , stein and tarjan @xcite ) . alternatively , one can use the published algorithm of tokuyama and nakano @xcite that requires time @xmath193 time . in either case , the time to find this one primal solution is dominated by the time already spent to solve all the duals ,",
    "so the overall running time bound is that for the latter : @xmath58 .",
    "one way to improve upon the above bound is to reduce the running time to solve an instance of the parametric transportation problem from @xmath121 to @xmath7 . at this point",
    "we do not know how to achieve the linear bound , but we feel that the following approach might be fruitful .    consider the above parametric transportation problem , and view the parameter @xmath141 as an additional ( real ) variable .",
    "the resulting linear program , which we call the primal , is not a transportation problem .",
    "nevertheless , the algorithms in zemel @xcite and megiddo and tamir @xcite can still solve the dual of this linear program in @xmath7 time .",
    "the missing ingredient at this point is how to use the dual solution to obtain ( in linear time ) , an optimal solution to the primal program .",
    "specifically , we only need to know the optimal ( real ) value of the primal variable @xmath141 , say @xmath194 .",
    "if @xmath194 is known , we can use the concavity property of the function @xmath180 to conclude that the optimal integer value of @xmath141 is attained by rounding @xmath194 up or down .",
    "we can then proceed as above .",
    "in this section , we describe a linear - time algorithm for determining the length of an optimal tour for the maximum tsp under rectilinear distances in the plane .",
    "this amounts to a proof of theorem  [ th : linear ] , structured into a series of lemmas and stretching over subsections  [ sub : stars ] to  [ sub : merge ] . at the end of the section",
    "we sketch how this result can be extended to any 4-facet polyhedral metric . throughout this section",
    "we assume without loss of generality that @xmath195 , as otherwise the problem is trivial .",
