    "the simulation of pbh emission is covered in chapter 7 .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in chapter 8 , and final conclusions are given in chapter 9 .    where convenient , natural units with @xmath3 will be used .",
    "the original analysis of pbh formation and distribution was made by carr and hawking @xcite .",
    "they investigated the formation of pbhs by the gravitational collapse of primordial density perturbations @xcite .",
    "this remains one of the most interesting formation mechanisms , especially since it is closely related to very small scales in the early universe .    however , there are of course also other possibilities for pbh formation , for example phase transitions @xcite , collapse of cosmic strings @xcite and softening of the equation of state @xcite .    in our further discussion ,",
    "we will limit ourselves to pbh formation from the collapse of density perturbations .",
    "let @xmath5 be the density contrast , i.e. the deviation in energy density relative to the background @xmath6 , at @xmath7 , @xmath8 looking at the fourier transform of @xmath5 , denoted @xmath9 , we can write @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the 3d dirac function and @xmath4 the _ power spectrum _ of the density fluctuations .",
    "this expression assumes the phases are uncorrelated , and hence the fourier transforms are uncorrelated .",

    "spectral index_. the case @xmath15 is the scale - invariant so called _ harrison - zeldovich _ spectrum .",
    "inflation @xcite produces a power spectrum that is close to scale - invariant .      hawking and carr imposed limits on @xmath16 for black hole formation to be possible",
    ". they found , using analytical arguments , that a spatial region will form a black hole if the density contrast @xmath16 in the region fulfills @xcite @xmath17 the lower constraint comes from requiring that the size of the region must be greater than the jeans length at the time of collapse , so that gravity can overcome pressure .",
    "the upper bound comes from requiring that the region not form a disconnected topology , i.e. a separate closed universe .",
    "the black holes formed in this picture are assumed to have an initial mass @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the horizon mass when the scale of interest crossed the horizon and @xmath20 determines the equation of state @xmath21 . for radiation domination",
    ", we have @xmath22 .      a recent development with interesting consequences for pbh formation is the realisation that _ near the threshold of black hole formation _ , gravitational collapse behaves as a critical phenomenon .",
    "numerical simulations by choptuik @xcite and evans and coleman @xcite suggest a scaling relation for black hole formation of the form @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is a constant dependent on the shape of the fluctuation , @xmath25 the ( shape - dependent ) critical density , @xmath26 the universal shape - independent scaling exponent and @xmath27 the horizon mass at pbh formation .    a valid question to ask is whether this phenomenon will be relevant for black hole formation .",
    "in general , it will not be relevant for astrophysical black holes , since along with other inhibiting effects it would require significant fine tuning of initial conditions .",
    "however , the effect on pbh formation was further investigated by niemeyer and jedamzik , who found that this scaling should be relevant for pbh formation @xcite .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that for pbh formation , one expects most regions collapsing to black holes to have an over - density close to @xmath25 .",
    "further numerical simulations @xcite showed that the scaling relation holds for pbh formation with nearly - critical initial conditions .",

    "most authors , as will we , today assume an inflationary scenario , since this solves several problems with the standard big bang model @xcite .",
    "hence any pbhs formed before the period of inflation will be diluted away .",
    "we consider therefore pbhs formed after inflation , typically immediately after the reheating epoch .",
    "the time of formation is then related to the reheating temperature @xmath30 as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the degrees of freedom of the constituents in the early universe ( @xmath33 in the standard model and @xmath34 in the mssm ) and @xmath35 the planck mass .",

    "we then recover the hawking spectrum in the case @xmath91 .",
    "these ideas have also recently been used in the context of string gravity to arrive at similar corrections @xcite .      in the model proposed by oliensis and hill @xcite and expanded upon by macgibbon and webber @xcite , all fundamental particles with rest mass less than or equal to the black hole temperature",
    "are emitted ( of course , occasionally heavier particles are emitted , but as seen in hawking s expression they are exponentially damped ) . when the black hole temperature reaches the qcd confinement scale @xmath92 mev , quark and gluon jets are emitted .",
    "these fragment and eventually produce hadrons and other particles .",
    "the authors argue that almost all emitted particles are much smaller than the black hole , since the de broglie wavelength of most emitted particles satisfies @xmath93    furthermore , successive emissions should not interact , since for most particles @xmath94 where @xmath68 is the particle energy and @xmath95 is the time between successive emissions .",
    "oliensis finds numerically that @xmath96 of the emitted particles should satisfy this .",
    "likewise , the previously emitted particles should not affect the emission process itself , since @xmath97    there should also be no strong interactions between successively emitted particles .",
    "lastly , gravitational effects on lifetimes , etc . should not have a significant effect on the final spectrum .    in summary , no short or long range forces should significantly affect the emission process before fragmentation and hadronisation , which means the emission is similar to that of @xmath98-annihilation events .",
    "however , it should be noted that these ideas have been challenged by heckler .",
    "he proposed in 1997 that qed and qcd photospheres ( or perhaps better termed photosphere and chromosphere as for the sun ) may form around the black hole above a certain black hole temperature when bremsstrahlung and pair - production becomes non - negligible @xcite .",

    "this list should also contain the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in the case of a supersymmetric model ( with r - parity conserved ) .",

    "the latter limit is an approximation to deal with the fact that our derivations , particularly hawking s , break down close to the planck scale .",

    "( [ eq : macf ] ) .",
    "this is naturally a slight overestimate of the lifetime , since the increase in degrees of freedom as the temperature rises is neglected .",
    "however , since the black hole spends most of its time near @xmath135 the relative error is small .",
    "this estimate of the pbh lifetime is shown in figure [ figure : lifetime ] , where the effect of the aforementioned error can be seen in that the msugra benchmark b lifetimes start to differ from the standard model only at masses lower than approximately @xmath136 .",
    "these expressions for the mass and lifetime hint at why pbhs are particularly interesting , i.e. why we do not consider emission from black holes formed from the collapse of stars at later epochs .",

    "for all practical purposes , these black holes will thus emit nothing .",
    "hawking emission provides a mechanism for pbhs to affect the early universe .",
    "the emitted particles can interact with radiation and matter in the universe and thus affect many of the early - universe phenomena : the cmbr @xcite , entropy production @xcite , baryogenesis @xcite and nucleosynthesis @xcite to name some .",
    "recently is was also realised that pbhs are potentially a great probe of the early universe with a varying gravitational constant @xcite .",
    "pbhs can be used to probe the primordial mass distribution , hence the spectral index @xmath14 in a power law power spectrum .",
    "page and hawking required that the emitted gamma rays from pbhs should not exceed the observed diffuse gamma - ray background ( dgb ) , and thus found a constraint on the abundance of pbhs @xcite .",

    "another popular approach is to require that some critical energy fraction @xmath141 , typically the total energy in pbhs @xmath142 .",

    "consequently , the pbh constraints provide information that cmbr measurements do not , especially in the case that @xmath147 is not a power law but a spike or step @xcite .",
    "to understand the basic concept behind supersymmetry ( susy ) , let us start from the quantum mechanical hamiltonian for a single particle : @xmath148 we now assume that the potential @xmath149 is unknown , but we know the ground state wave function @xmath150 which we will assign the energy eigenvalue 0 ( no loss of generality ) . inserting the ground state wave function into the schrdinger equation for the above hamiltonian",
    "we find @xmath151 if we now set out to write the hamiltonian @xmath152 in a standard form , i. e. @xmath153 , we can write @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the so called _ superpotential_.",

    "using the schrdinger equation for the two hamiltonians , one finds that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are related as @xmath163 @xmath164 @xmath165 both sets of eigenvalues are positive semi - definite , and the energy levels are degenerate , except for @xmath152 which has an `` extra '' level at zero energy .",
    "we also see that one effect of the operators @xmath166 and @xmath167 is to `` jump between the potentials '' .",

    ", what we have seen is that given a particle ( ground state wave function ) , we may construct another particle such that they are both described by the same superpotential , and bosonic degrees of freedom in one particle correspond to fermionic degrees of freedom in the other . in a sense",
    "they are both `` components '' of a `` superparticle '' .",
    "the ideas laid out in the preceding section form the basis of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",
    "the main motivations for considering supersymmetry are :    * solution of hierarchy and naturalness problems * connection between gravity and other fundamental interactions * can learn about high - energy physics in general * rich experimental consequences    the hierarchy and naturalness problems are intimately related .",
    "suppose we wish to write down a lagrangian which accounts correctly for physics up to some energy scale @xmath175 much larger than the electro - weak scale @xmath176 .",
    "choosing to break electro - weak symmetry by the higgs mechanism , one finds that the masses of scalar excitations of the field will be of order @xmath175 .",
    "this is due to radiative corrections , the mass corrections being @xmath177 .",
    "specifically , the higgs mass would become huge , destroying the hierarchy between the electroweak and @xmath175 scales , giving us the hierarchy problem .",
    "the simplest way to avoid this problem is to fine - tune the coupling constants to an accuracy of @xmath178 ( in the case @xmath179 ) .",
    "this is the naturalness problem .",
    "supersymmetry removes or significantly improves on these problems by introducing new corrections from the new particles , which reduces the fine - tuning requirement to at most @xmath180 and completely removes it in some cases .",
    "since we have not observed supersymmetric particles with the same masses as their standard model partners , supersymmetry can not be an exact symmetry .",
    "we thus need a mechanism for spontaneously breaking supersymmetry .",
    "the symmetry breaking imposes approximate limits on the mass splitting between a particle and its supersymmetric partner : if the higgs boson mass correction @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the boson mass and @xmath183 the fermion mass of a particle - supersymmetric partner pair , is to be of the order of the electroweak gauge - boson masses or less , the mass splittings should not be much greater than the electroweak scale .    on a side note , there are other models for dealing with the naturalness problem , for instance the technicolor approach where fundamental scalars are composites of new fermions .",
    "this approach is however technically difficult .",
    "local supersymmetry , i.e. where transformations are allowed to depend on position and time , and gravity are closely related .",
    "loosely speaking , local supersymmetry gives local poincar symmetry , which is the basis for general relativity .",
    "because of this relation , local supersymmetry is called supergravity ( sugra ) .",
    "initially , it was thought that this supergravity could hold as a successful theory of everything .",
    "however , theoretical considerations have shown that it most likely would only be an effective theory up to some energy scale .",
    "nevertheless , it remains important since it turns out to be the proper framework for spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry ( which is required ) .",
    "there are rich experimental consequences from supersymmetric particle models , so it is possible to test the ideas .",
    "one important prediction is the existence of stable particles , which could explain at least part of the cold dark matter problem in cosmology .",
    "even if supersymmetry in the end turns out not to be a correct description of nature , we can learn a lot about how high - energy physics should behave from studying these theories .",
    "there are also aesthetic and philosophical arguments for considering supersymmetry .",
