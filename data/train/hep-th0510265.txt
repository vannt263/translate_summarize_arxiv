    "all the phases become purely dynamical , i.e. , part of the hamiltonian , and thus the analysis of geometric phases is reduced to a simple diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",

    "one obtains a better view of topological properties , such as the absence of the monopole - like singularity .",
    "differences between the quantum anomaly and the geometric phase become clear in this formulation .",
    "+ from the point of view of particle physicists , the essence of the geometric phase may be summarized as follows : the essence of the geometric phase is to use an _ approximation _ ( adiabatic approximation ) to obtain a clear universal view of what is going on in the general level crossing problem , which is not clearly seen in the exact treatment .",
    "mathematically , a time dependent unitary transformation which is singular at the level crossing point palys a central role .",
    "we start with the generic ( hermitian ) hamiltonian @xmath1 for a single particle theory in a slowly varying background variable + @xmath2 .",

    "both - hand sides of the above equality ( 14 ) are exact , but the difference is that the geometric terms , both of diagonal and off - diagonal , are explicit in the second quantized formulation on the left - hand side .",

    "the path integral formula ( 11 ) is based on the expansion @xmath22 and the starting path integral ( 2 ) depends only on the field variable @xmath23 , not on @xmath24 and @xmath25 separately .",
    "this fact shows that our formulation contains a hidden local gauge symmetry @xmath26 where the gauge parameter @xmath27 is a general function of @xmath28 .",
    "we call this symmetry `` hidden local gauge symmetry '' because it appears due to the separation of the fundamental dynamical variable @xmath23 into two sets @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    ". one can confirm that the action and the path integral measure in ( 11 ) are both invariant under this gauge transformation .",
    "the above hidden local symmetry is exact as long as the basis set is not singular . in the present problem ,",
    "the basis set becomes singular on top of level crossing , and thus the above symmetry is particularly useful in the general adiabatic approximation defined by the condition that the basis set is well - defined .",
    "of course , one may consider a new hidden local gauge symmetry when one defines a new regular coordinate in the neighborhood of the singularity , and the freedom in the phase choice of the new basis set persists .",
    "physically , this hidden gauge symmetry arises from the fact that the choice of the basis set which specifies the coordinates in the functional space is arbitrary in field theory , as long as the coordinates are not singular .    in practical applications for generic eigenvalues @xmath29 ,",
    "the sub - group @xmath30 as in the above ( 20 ) is useful , because it keeps the form of the action invariant and thus becomes a symmetry of quantized theory in the conventional sense .",
    "in particular , it is exactly preserved in the adiabatic approximation in which the mixing of different energy eigenstates is assumed to be negligible and thus the coordinates specified are always well - defined .    for a special case where the first eigenvalue @xmath31 has @xmath32-fold degeneracy",
    ", the second eigenvalue @xmath33 has @xmath34-fold degeneracy , and so on , the sub - group @xmath35 which keeps the form of the action invariant , will be useful .",
    "the above hidden local gauge symmetry is an exact symmetry of quantum theory , and thus physical observables in the adiabatic approximation should respect this symmetry .",
    "also , by using this local gauge freedom , one can choose the phase convention of the basis set @xmath36 such that the analysis of geometric phases becomes most transparent .    under the hidden local symmetry",
    ", the probability amplitude in ( 17 ) transforms @xmath37 _ independently _ of the value of @xmath28 .",
    "thus the product @xmath38 defines a manifestly gauge invariant quantity , namely , it is independent of the choice of the phase convention of the complete basis set @xmath36 .    for the adiabatic formula ( 18 ) , the gauge invariant quantity is given by @xmath39dt\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the combination @xmath40dt\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is invariant under the hidden local gauge symmetry . by choosing the gauge such that @xmath41 the prefacotor @xmath42 becomes real and positive .",

    "note that our gauge transformation , which is defined by an arbitrary function @xmath27 , is more general .",
    "it has been shown that this hidden gauge symmetry replaces the notions of parallel transport and holonomy in the analysis of geometric phases .",
    "we note that the notion such as holonomy is valid only in the limit of the very precise adiabatic approximation  @xcite .",
    "we analyze the crossing of two levels in the above general model . in the sufficiently close to the level crossing point",
    ", we assume that we can truncate the model to a simplified two - level model which contains the two levels at issue .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the lagarangian in ( 6 ) is then reduced to the @xmath47 matrix @xmath48 . if one assumes that the level crossing takes place at the origin of the parameter space @xmath49 , one analyzes the matrix @xmath50 for sufficiently small @xmath51 . after a suitable definition of the parameters @xmath52 by taking linear combinations of @xmath53",
