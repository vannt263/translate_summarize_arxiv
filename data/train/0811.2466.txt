    "2001 ) @xmath0-ray binaries that are spatially coincident with sources above 100 mev listed in the third energetic gamma - ray experiment ( egret ) catalogue ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) . both of these sources show low x - ray emission and variability , and no signs of emission lines or disk accretion ( see the recent works by sidoli et al .",

    "2006 , paredes et al .",
    "2007 ) .    extended , apparently precessing , radio emitting structures at angular extensions of 0.01 - 0.05 arcsec have been reported by massi et al .",

    "al . 2006 , albert et al .",
    "in fact , dhawan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) presented observations from a july 2006 vlbi campaign in which rapid changes are seen in the orientation of what seems to be a cometary tail at periastron .",
    "this tail is consistent with it being the result of a pulsar wind .",
    "no large features or high - velocity flows were noted in any of the observing days , which implies at least its non - permanent nature .",
    "the changes within 3 hours were found to be insignificant , so the velocity can not be much over 0.05@xmath1 .",
    "albert et al . (",
    "2008a ) confirmed these finding observing in a different period about a year later , and showed that the morphology of the radio emission of the system is maintained .",
    "this emphasized the possibility that a pulsar is the compact object companion , since the changing morphology of the radio emission along the orbit would require a highly unstable jet , which details are not expected to be reproduced orbit after orbit .",
    "it is also to be noted that all other be binaries known to date have neutron - star companions ( negueruela 2004 ) .",
    "the reason for this may lie in source evolution if the rotation of be stars is achieved during a period of roche - lobe overflow mass transfer from its initially more massive companion . if the companion loses most of its mass in the process , becoming a he star with mass of only a few m@xmath2 , when exploding as a supernova it can only leave a neutron star behind ( see , e.g. , gies 2000 , tauris & van den heuvel 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "there has been a recent burst of activity trying to understand and model the high energy multi - messenger emission from ls i + 61 303 , and especially , but not only , assuming that it is a pulsar binary ( see , e.g. , the latest works by bosch - ramon et al .",

    "their analysis of the system also finds that the presence of a young pulsar is compatible with all observational constraints .",
    "free - free absorption suppresses most of the radio emission within the orbit , including the pulsed signal of the rotating neutron star . in here",
    ", we do not consider clumpiness of the polar wind but rather the impact ( onto the computation of opacities to high energy processes leading to @xmath0-rays ) of even more basic assumptions , like the uncertainties in the orbital elements of ls i + 61 303  and the main average parameters of the stellar wind of the optical companion . with this study at hand ,",

    "( 2007 ) , the paucity of measurements in the orbital phase range 0.4  0.5 , and the possibility that the balmer lines could be contaminated by the disc of the star , still cast some doubts as to what is the real orbital solution of the system .    in",
    "what follows , we will work with both sets of orbital solutions and show that such differences , and others given in table [ tab : orb - param ] , produce non - negligible changes in the opacities of leptonic processes that lead to high energy emission .",
    "important geometrical magnitudes , such as the angle to the observer as measured from the pulsar site as a function of phase along the orbit are notably affected by the choice of orbital solutions , since they depend directly on the geometry , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_obs ] . in turn , this and other differences unavoidably lead to changes in opacities .",
    "the orbital period of ls i + 61 303  is @xmath13 days ( taylor & gregory , 1982 ) , with the best measurement coming from the radio observations @xmath14 days ( gregory 2002 ) .",
    "the massive star is of b0 ve type ( hutchings & crampton 1981 , paredes et al . 1994 ) .",

    ", we rather assume a radius of @xmath17 ( e.g. harmanec 1988 ) , the effective temperature is @xmath18 k. a different temperature changes the photon field against which we have computed inverse compton processes .",
    "the dimensions of the star have also an impact on the presented results for each orbital configuration yielding to the change of relative separation , what is shown in table [ tab : orb - param ] ; the massive star is not a point - like source , what we have also taken into account .",
    "the estimation of the inclination of the orbital plane is related to the knowledge on the mass of each of the stars . to give an example",
    "; from the mass function , @xmath19 ( casares et al . 2005 ) , and taking the possible inclination as @xmath20 or 60@xmath21 with the mass of the massive companion in the middle of their preferred mass range @xmath22 , one can get the mass of the compact object within @xmath23 ( higher inclination implies a lower mass of the compact object , favouring a pulsar scenario ) .",
    "based on these estimations , we get the semimajor axis of the binary as @xmath24 au ( @xmath25 cm ) .",
