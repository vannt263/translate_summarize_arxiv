    ". moreover the union of these basins covers lebesgue almost all points of @xmath1 and the supports @xmath12 are attractors , i.e. , @xmath13 is a compact @xmath0-invariant transitive set whose basin of attraction is a neighborhood of @xmath13 .",
    "recently bonatti - viana  @xcite together with alves  @xcite prove results analogous to the results of sinai , ruelle and bowen for some maps with nonuniform expansion : there are finitely many srb measures whose basins cover lebesgue almost every point of the ambient manifold .",
    "it is worth noting that the mere _ existence _ of time averages for general systems is still an open problem .    the problem of stability of the measures @xmath14 has been studied for uniformly hyperbolic systems by kifer  @xcite and young  @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that if we fix a @xmath13 and take at each iteration a diffeomorphism @xmath15 close to @xmath0 , @xmath16 , then the time averages ( subject to a given probability distribution for the choices of @xmath15 ) @xmath17 exist for a positive lebesgue measure subset of points @xmath18",

    "we show here ( theorem  [ thma ] ) that a dynamical system given by a diffeomorphism @xmath2 , exhibiting several ( infinitely many ) attractors @xmath23 , @xmath24 , has physical probability measures under random perturbations that are close to invariant probability measures supported on @xmath25 when the perturbed maps are close to @xmath0 if ( i ) _ the union of the basins of attraction @xmath26 covers lebesgue almost all points of @xmath1 _ and ( ii ) _ each attractor @xmath25 is stochastically stable_. condition ( ii ) means that each @xmath25 supports an @xmath0-invariant probability measure @xmath27 such that the time averages of continuous functions @xmath28 , along randomly perturbed orbits _ in a neighborhood _ of the attractor , converge to @xmath29 when the perturbed maps are very close to the unperturbed map @xmath0 .",
    "we do not assume that the attractors support @xmath11 measures .",
    "in particular we obtain ( corollary  [ corollary ] ) for the classical axiom a case a new result , about the convergence of the distribution of the mean sojourn time of randomly perturbed orbits to a specific linear combination of the @xmath11 measures of the hyperbolic attractors , with weights given by the lebesgue measure of the basins of attraction of each hyperbolic attractor , when the perturbations are close to the unperturbed map @xmath0 .    in theorem  [ thmb ]",
    "we suppose that the number @xmath30 of attractors is finite and replace condition ( i ) by a weaker condition on the _ trapping regions _ of @xmath0 . if for all open sets @xmath31 satisfying @xmath32 it holds that @xmath33 then we show that the distribution of the mean sojourn times of randomly perturbed orbits in subsets of @xmath1 tends to a linear convex combination of the probability measures @xmath5 , when the perturbed maps get close to @xmath0 .",
    "these results favor a global notion of stochastic stability , already proposed by e.g. viana  @xcite , as opposed to the usual notion of stochastic stability built on single attractors : stochastically stable systems have time averages given by measures that are close to a linear convex combination of invariant measures for the unperturbed system . moreover",
