    "can be expressed in terms of the generalized parton distributions ( gpd ) @xcite , in the case of real compton scattering ( rcs ) the available theoretical tools are rather undeveloped .    on the one hand , as it has been shown in  @xcite , for large momentum transfer @xmath1 it is possible to factorize the rcs amplitude  @xcite and express it in terms of the distribution amplitudes of the proton . on the other hand ,",

    "dvcs and rcs on a proton have been studied recently within the color dipole approach in  @xcite . here",
    "we extend that study to nuclear targets .",
    "the dvcs process on a nuclear target has been measured at hera by hermes collaboration  @xcite and may be also studied at the future electron ion collider ( eic ) and large hadron electron collider ( lhec )  @xcite . the real compton scattering ( rcs )",
    "may be measured at the lhc , as a subprocess in hadron - hadron collisions in ultraperipheral kinematics . since",
    "both dvcs and rcs are studied in the high - energy kinematics , the nuclear effects reveal themselves as shadowing corrections .",
    "the general framework for evaluation of the shadowing corrections is the gribov - glauber approach  @xcite .",
    "while in the asymptotic high - energy ( `` frozen '' ) regime the shadowing corrections were studied in  @xcite , we use an approach which is also valid for intermediate energies .",
    "also , we take into account the gluon shadowing corrections , which appear for @xmath2 and give a sizeable contribution for @xmath3 .    the paper is organized as follows . in sections  [ sec :",
    "dipolemodel ] we review the general formalism of the color dipole approach . in section  [ sec : frozen ] we discuss the frequently used frozen approximation which is valid for asymptotically large energies . in section  [ sec : sha - coh ] we discuss the method which will be used for calculations of nuclear shadowing effects and demonstrate that for asymptotically large energies it reproduces the results from  section  [ sec : frozen ] . in section  [ sec : gluonshadowing ]",
    "we discuss the gluon shadowing and its effect on the dvcs and rcs observables . in section  [ sec : wffromivm ] the wavefunction of a real photon is evaluated in the instanton vacuum model . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the results of numerical evaluation , and in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we draw conclusions .",
    "the color dipole model is particularly efficient at high energies , where the dominant contribution to the compton amplitude comes from gluonic exchanges .",
    "then the general expression for the compton amplitude on a nucleon has the form ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the photon polarization vector ; @xmath6 are the light - cone fractional momenta of the quark and antiquark , @xmath7 are the transverse distances in the final and initial dipoles respectively ; @xmath8 is the momentum transfer in the compton scattering * * , * * @xmath9 is the scattering amplitude of the dipole on the target ( proton or nucleus ) , and @xmath10 are the wavefunctions of the initial and final photons in the polarization state @xmath11 @xcite .    at high energies in the small angle approximation , @xmath12 , the quark separation and fractional momenta @xmath13",

    "we use a gaussian parameterization  @xcite ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 are the free parameters fixed from the dis and @xmath22 scattering data .",
    "we shall discuss them in more detail in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the parameterization  ( [ eq : gpdparametrization ] ) does not depend on the longitudinal momentum transfer and decreases exponentially as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "since the parameterization  ( [ eq : gpdparametrization ] ) is an effective one and is valid only in the small-@xmath24 region , we do not assume that it satisfies general requirements , such as positivity  @xcite and polynomiality  @xcite constraints .",

    "if the limit @xmath31 exists and is finite , then the real and imaginary parts of the forward amplitude are related as@xmath32\\frac{\\im m\\,{f(\\delta=0)}}{s^{\\alpha}}.\\label{eq : bronzanful}\\ ] ] in the model under consideration the imaginary part of the forward dipole amplitude indeed has a power dependence on energy , @xmath33 , so ( [ eq : bronzanful ] ) simplifies to @xmath34    this fixes the phase of the forward compton amplitude , which we retain for nonzero momentum transfers , assuming similar dependences for the real and imaginary parts",

    "nuclear shadowing signals the closeness of the unitarity limit .",
    "hard reactions possess this feature only if they have a contribution from soft interactions . in dis and",
    "dvcs the soft contribution arises from the so called aligned jet configurations @xcite , corresponding to @xmath37 fluctuations very asymmetric in sharing the photon momentum , @xmath38 .",
    "such virtual photon fluctuations , having large transverse separation , are the source of shadowing @xcite .",
    "calculation of nuclear shadowing simplifies considerably in the case of long coherence length @xcite , i.e. long lifetime of the photon fluctuations , when it considerably exceeds the nuclear size . in this case",
    "lorentz time dilation `` freezes '' the transverse size of the fluctuation during propagation though the nucleus .",

    "we treated the term quadratic in the dipole cross section as a small number and expanded the exponential in curly brackets .",
    "the regime of frozen dipole size discussed in the previous section is valid only at very small @xmath45 in dvcs , or at high energies in rcs .",
    "however , at medium small @xmath45 a dipole can `` breath '' , i.e. vary its size , during propagation through the nucleus , and one should rely on a more sophisticated approach .",
    "in this paper we employ the description of the onset of shadowing developed in  @xcite and based on the light - cone green function technique @xcite .",
    "the propagation of a color dipole in a nuclear medium is described as motion in an absorptive potential , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath46 where the green function @xmath47 describes the probability amplitude for propagation of dipole state with size @xmath48 at the light - cone starting point @xmath49 to the dipole state with size @xmath50 at the light - cone point @xmath51 then the shadowing correction to the amplitude has the form@xmath52 where@xmath53    equation  ( [ eq : w - definition ] ) is quite complicated and in the general case may be solved only numerically @xcite .",
    "however in some cases an analytic solution is possible .",
    "for example , in the limit of long coherence length , @xmath54 , relevant for high - energy accelerators like lhc , one can neglect the `` kinetic '' term  @xmath55 in  ( [ eq : w - definition ] ) , and get the green function in the `` frozen '' approximation @xcite , @xmath56 then the shadowing correction  ( [ eq : dvcs - coh - sha ] ) simplifies to @xmath57 if we neglect the real part of the amplitude and the longitudinal momentum transfer @xmath58 ( which is justified for asymptotically large @xmath59 ) , and average over polarizations , then taking the integral over @xmath60  by parts  in  ( [ eq : dvcs - coh - sha ] ) , we get for the elastic amplitude @xmath61\\psi_{in}\\left(\\alpha , r\\right).\\label{eq : a - frozen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] another case where an analytical solution is possible is when the effective dipole sizes are small and the function @xmath62 may be approximated as @xmath63 this approximation can not be precise even at high virtuality @xmath64 in dvcs , since there are contributions of the aligned jet configurations mentioned above , which permit large dipoles even for large @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , such aligned jet configurations of the dipole provide the main contribution to nuclear shadowing @xcite . nevertheless , for the sake of simplicity we rely on this approximation in order to estimate the magnitude of the shadowing corrections .",

    "therefore the frozen approximation employed in @xcite can not be used for an interpretation of hermes data , instead one should rely on the green function method described above .",
    "in addition to the coherent processes which leave the recoil nucleus intact , a large contribution to photon production comes from incoherent compton scattering , where the target nucleus breaks up .",
    "using the missing mass technique one can select events @xmath67 in which the nucleus breaks up to fragments without production of mesons . in this case",
    "one can employ completeness of the final states , which greatly simplifies the calculations .",
    "the analysis of such processes in electroproduction of vector mesons was done in  @xcite , and its extension to the dvcs and rcs is quite straightforward and yields    @xmath68    at sufficiently high energies one can rely on the frozen approximation introduced in the previous section , and this formula may be simplified @xcite , @xmath69\\sigma_{\\bar{q}q}\\left(r , s\\right)\\psi_{in}\\left(\\alpha , r\\right),\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    correspondingly the cross section ( [ xsection ] ) takes the form , @xmath70 this expression reproduces eq .",

    "it has been known since  @xcite that in addition to the quark shadowing inside nuclei there is also a shadowing of gluons , which leads to attenuation of the gluon parton distributions .",
    "while nuclear shadowing of quarks is directly measured in dis , the shadowing of gluons is poorly known from data  @xcite , mainly due to the relatively large error bars in the nuclear structure functions and their weak dependence on the gluon distributions , which only comes via evolution .",
    "the theoretical predictions for the gluon shadowing strongly depend on the implemented model  while for @xmath77 they all predict that the gluon shadowing is small , for @xmath2 the predictions vary in a wide range ( see the review  @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "in this section we present briefly some details of evaluation of the wavefunction in the instanton vacuum model  ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "such processes called ultra - peripheral collisions ( upc ) can be studied in @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 collisions . in particular , one can access rcs in the reaction @xmath166 the typical virtualities @xmath167 of the intermediate photon @xmath168 are controlled by the formfactors of the colliding particles , and are small : @xmath169 where @xmath72 is the atomic number of the hadron ( @xmath170 for a proton ) interacting electromagnetically , i.e. emitting the photon , while the second hadron interacts strongly .",
    "thus , @xmath167 is of the order of the soft hadronic scale , so the intermediate photon can be treated as a free weizscker - williams one , i.e. the amplitude of the process  ( [ eq : pp2ppgamma ] ) can be described in terms of rcs .    these processes at the lhc will allow to study rcs at very high energies .",
    "the possibility of observation of such processes experimentally has been demonstrated by the star @xcite and phenix  @xcite experiments at rhic .",
    "it is expected that at lhc photon - proton collisions at energies up to @xmath171  gev can be observed  @xcite .",
