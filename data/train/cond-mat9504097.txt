    "it is now rather well established that the quantum energy levels of classically chaotic billiards have wigner  dyson correlations @xcite .",
    "these universal correlations are closely associated with the concept of `` quantum chaos '' and have first been obtained in random matrix theory @xcite ( rmt ) in a different context ( statistical description of the spectral properties of complex nuclei and small metallic particles ) .",
    "futhermore , many works@xcite have considered the case where the system hamiltonian @xmath12 depends on an external parameter @xmath13 . instead of a single matrix ensemble defined by a certain probability density , a continuous family of ensembles , defined by a @xmath13dependent probability density , is considered .",
    "the universality of the level correlations can then be extended to a broader domain , which involves not only ( small ) level separations at a given @xmath13 , but also ( small ) external parameter separation @xmath14 .",
    "this broader universality has been numerically checked in very different physical systems : disordered conductors@xcite , quantum billiards@xcite , the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field@xcite and correlated electron systems@xcite .",

    "the @xmath13-dependence of the level distribution is then determined by a fokker ",

    ", the system is not closed , but open to electron reservoirs , and becomes a @xmath1-channel scatterer with transmission eigenvalues @xmath0 .",
    "many transport properties@xcite ( conductance , quantum shot noise ... ) are linear statistics of the @xmath1 eigenvalues @xmath0 , which are the appropriate levels for a scattering problem .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath2 or transfer matrix @xmath8 , suitably parametrized by the @xmath1 transmission eigenvalues @xmath0 and certain auxiliary unitary matrices , are the relevant matrices for which rmt approaches have been formulated .",
    "for instance , if the unitary @xmath2-matrix is distributed according to one of dyson s classical circular ensembles @xcite , the corresponding transmission eigenvalue distributions have been recently obtained @xcite , exhibiting the same logaritmic pairwise repulsion than for the energy levels , and hence giving essentially the same wigner ",

    "the @xmath2-brownian motion ensemble is simply the original ensemble introduced by dyson@xcite for the scattering matrix @xmath2 @xmath16 the idea is to assume that @xmath2 _ diffuses _ in the @xmath2-matrix space with respect to a fictitious time @xmath13 of the brownian motion , and converges in the limit @xmath17 to a stationary probability distribution given by one of the well known circular ensembles : circular unitary ensemble ( cue , @xmath18 ) when there is no time reversal symmetry ( applied magnetic field ) ; circular orthogonal ensemble ( coe , @xmath19 ) when there are time reversal and spin rotation symmetries ( no spin ",

    "the _ decisive _ difference between our approach and refs .",
    "@xcite is that we do not consider the usual eigenvector ",
    "eigenvalue parametrization of @xmath2 , but the parametrization which explicitly uses the @xmath1 transmission eigenvalues @xmath0 of @xmath23 as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . since there exists neither a simple mathematical method nor an intuitive way to relate the @xmath24 eigenvalues @xmath25 of @xmath2 with the @xmath1 transmission eigenvalues @xmath0 , it is justified to reconsider the brownian motion in terms of the latter .",
    "this parametrization is suitable to determine the `` time '' dependence of the @xmath0 , by a fokker ",
    "planck equation which we map , using a transformation introduced by sutherland , onto a schrdinger equation with imaginary time . in the case of the stationary cue limit ,",
    "one has a problem of @xmath1 non interacting fermions which we solve exactly for arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "one obtains for the corresponding parametric correlations of the transmission eigenvalues the same universal form than for the energy levels , after an appropriate rescaling and _ within certain limits_.    a physical application of such a parametric ensemble can for example be realized by two weakly coupled ballistic ( irregular ) cavities , each of them connected to one electron reservoir ( fig .",
    "the crossover between two cue towards a single cue is performed by changing the strength of the coupling from nearly uncoupled cavities ( two cue ) to idealy coupled cavities ( one cue ) , when a small constant magnetic field is applied .",
    "the transmission eigenvalue parametrization is very well adapted to this case since the initial condition is easily realized by the requirement @xmath26 .",
    "another application of the dyson brownian motion ensemble , concerning the crossover coe @xmath5 cue in terms of the @xmath0 is presented elsewhere @xcite .    outside the problem of two weakly coupled quantum dots ,",
    "we are also motivated by numerical calculations @xcite showing that the scattering matrix of a quasi one - dimensional disordered wire exhibits also some properties of the circular ensembles , in the sense that the correlation of the scattering phase shifts @xmath22 were found to be approximately described by the universal correlations functions of these ensembles . for the disordered wire , a crossover from one circular ensemble towards two independent circular ensembles",
    "was observed as the length of the wire exceeds its localization length .",
    "the appropriate statistical description @xcite of the transmission eigenvalues of disordered wires is given by a different brownian motion ensemble than the original dyson model , and results from the multiplicative combination law of the transfer matrix @xmath8 .",
    "this is what we call the @xmath8-brownian motion ensemble which yields another fokker - planck equation taking into account the quasi one - dimensional structure .",
    "this fokker - planck equation has been solved by beenakker and rejaei@xcite in the unitary case , using the sutherland transformation .",
    "a remarkable result which they found is that the transmission eigenvalue pairwise interaction is universal , in the sense that it does not contain any adjustable parameter .",
    "it coincides with the standard logaritmic rmt repulsion for small eigenvalue separations , and it is halved for larger separations",
    ". the physical interpretation of this halving is unclear , but must be somewhat related to the statistical decoupling of the reflection properties of the two opposite system edges .",
    "if it is right , the dyson brownian motion ensemble must also exhibit in the crossover regime @xmath4cue @xmath27cue a somewhat similar pairwise interaction for weak transmission .",
    "it is therefore an interesting idea to compare those two different brownian motion ensembles for the transmission eigenvalues .",
    "let us mention the obvious difference between them : their initial and stationary limits are inverse of each other .",
    "for the @xmath2matrix model , we start from no transmission towards a good cue transmission . for the @xmath8matrix model on the contrary",

    "we show how to recover for the transmission eigenvalues the same universal parametric correlations than for the energy levels , after rescaling and within certain limits .    in section [ section:2add ] , we treat completely the system of two coupled ballistic cavities by the @xmath2brownian motion ensemble for the unitary case .",

    "we emphasize that the solution of the brownian motion ensemble is now complete , contrary to the sigma model approach where one only knows @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the large @xmath1-limit . in section [ section:3c ] , some further simplifications valid in the localized limit lead to asymptotic expressions for the density and the two point function for the logarithm of the transmission eigenvalues .",
