    "fast magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves can propagate across various magnetic structures , and could therefore be easily trapped in structures with low alfvnspeeds ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , it has also been adopted to infer the effective polytropic index of coronal plasmas @xcite , magnetic topology of sunspots @xcite , and the magnetic structure of large - scale coronal streamers @xcite .    while not a common practice in the literature , modelling the inhomogeneous solar atmosphere as randomly structured plasmas is more appropriate in a number of situations .",
    "for instance , this approach has been adopted to model the plethora of thin fibrils in sunspots @xcite , the filamentary coronal loops @xcite , and the structuring in the solar corona across the solar disk ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter referred to as ) .",
    "@xcite examined the dispersive oscillatory wakes of fast waves in randomly structured plasmas .",
    "@xcite studied the possible deceleration of fast waves due to random structuring . performed a parametric study on the attenuation of fast wave pulses propagating across a randomly structured corona , and proposed the application of the results for seismologically exploiting the frequently observed large - scale extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) waves .",
    "previous investigations of the global euv waves across the solar disk primarily focused on the nature and properties of the leading front ( see the reviews by , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , secondary waves have been observed at strong magnetic waveguides or anti - waveguides , e.g. , active regions @xcite , coronal holes @xcite , prominences @xcite , and coronal loops @xcite .",
    "these studies on secondary waves were primarily intended to provide support for the wave nature of euv waves .",
    "however , given that their spatial distribution and temporal evolution can now be observed in substantial detail , secondary waves may well be suitable for remotely diagnosing the structured solar atmosphere as well ( ) .    in this study",
    ", we present a detailed numerical study on the interaction between fast wave pulses with a randomly structured plasma , paying special attention to secondary waves in the wake of the leading fast wave pulse .",
    "we describe our numerical model in section  [ sec : model ] , and then present a case study on the secondary waves and their quasi - periodicity in section  [ sec : period ] .",
    "then we perform a parametric study on how this quasi - periodicity is affected by plasma structuring ( section  [ sec : para ] ) .",

    "some derivative constants are also relevant , e.g. , the alfvnspeed @xmath18 and the alfvntransit time @xmath19 . in the following text , all symbols represent normalized variables .    the mpi - amrvac code was configured to solve the one - dimensional ( 1d ) version of the ideal mhd equations in cartesian coordinates @xmath20 , meaning that all dependent variables depend only on @xmath21 .",
    "we chose the three - step runge - kutta method for time integration .",

    "@xmath24 is also uniform , corresponding to a plasma beta of @xmath25 everywhere in the computational domain .",
    "random structuring is realized by specifying a proper density profile @xmath26 . a uniform plasma pressure is maintained by adjusting the temperature profile ( @xmath27 ) accordingly .",
    "the density profile is formed by a set of sinusoidal modulations superimposed on a uniform background , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a scaling parameter , and @xmath30 is the size of the numerical domain in the @xmath21-direction .",

    "a correlation length @xmath3 is defined to quantify the average spacing between two fine structures ; and a density contrast @xmath2 is calculated to define the coarseness of density fluctuations ( ) . a density distribution with @xmath37 and @xmath38 is shown in figure  [ fig : yt](a ) for illustration purposes .",
    "fast wave pulses to be launched into the equilibrium are in the form of a gaussian profile centered around @xmath39 with an amplitude of @xmath40 and an initial width of @xmath1 ( ): @xmath41,\\\\ b'_x(t=0 , y)&=a_0\\exp\\left[-4\\ln2\\frac{(y - y_0)^2}{w_0 ^ 2 } \\right ] , \\\\",

    "this form of perturbation simulates a local eigenmode solution and ensures that fast waves are uni - directional .",
    "hereafter , fast wave pulses with @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) will be referred to as small-(large- ) amplitude pulses . as will be shown",
    ", the small - amplitude pulses have negligible nonlinear effects , whereas the large - amplitude ones lead to non - restorable density perturbations .",
    "we start with an examination of what happens when a small - amplitude fast pulse with @xmath47 is launched into a randomly structured plasma as depicted in figure  [ fig : yt](a ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : yt](b ) presents the distribution in the @xmath48 plane of the @xmath21-component of the velocity perturbation ( @xmath49 ) , where the diagonal ridge is the course of the leading fast wave pulse . while propagating , this pulse undergoes a series of interactions with the random plasma , thereby experiencing some attenuation and broadening ( ) . in addition ,",
    "secondary waves with amplitudes at about 10 - 20% of that of the main pulse are clearly seen , forming a ` fabric ' pattern as a result of partial transmissions and reflections .",
    "partial reflection is strong at sharp density changes ( e.g. , at @xmath50 ) , as evidenced by the strong backward propagation of secondary waves .     and a correlation length @xmath38 .",

    "are multiplied by @xmath53 for presentation purposes .",
    "[ fig : yt],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we see that the secondary waves exhibit both spatial and temporal quasi - periodicities .",
    "to better show this , we derive the the fourier spectra for the secondary waves shown in the two curves in figure  [ fig : yt](b ) by excluding the main pulse and the zeros ahead of the pulse . as shown in figure  [ fig : fft](a ) , the velocity variation @xmath54 has prominent oscillations with periods in the range between @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( figure  [ fig : fft](a ) ) .",
    "the average period is found to be @xmath57 ( see appendix [ sec : method ] for how we calculate this @xmath0 ) .",
    "this periodicity is not unique to the temporal profile of @xmath49 at @xmath51 , but is found at all other positions . on the other hand , the spatial period ( figure  [ fig : fft](b ) ) for @xmath58 ranges from @xmath55 to @xmath59 ( or from @xmath60 to @xmath61 ) , with an average value of @xmath62 .",
    "the average spatial period is a few times longer than the correlation length @xmath3 , meaning that secondary waves need to traverse several correlation lengths before settling into a quasi - periodic signal .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite .",
    "in addition , the temporal periodicity is found to be correlated with the spatial one , which is not surprising given that the fast wave pulse and secondary waves have an average speed of propagation of about unity in numerical units .",
    "the randomness in spatial structuring is transformed into the randomness in the temporal domain .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , quasi - periodicity is an intrinsic property of a random time series , and the quasi - periods are usually a few times longer than the timescales of the transients .",

    "in this section , we investigate how the quasi - periodicities depend on various parameters characterizing the equilibrium density profiles and fast pulses . as is evident from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dens ] ) , the equilibrium density profile is characterized primarily by the density contrast @xmath2 and correlation length @xmath3 . on the other hand , in addition to the amplitudes ,",
    "fast pulses are also characterized by their initial widths @xmath1 . to bring out the effects of each individual parameter on the average period @xmath0",
    ", we choose to vary a designated parameter alone by fixing the rest .",
    "in addition , since the periodicities in the temporal and spatial domains are correlated , we will only show the results for the temporal periodicities .",
    "given that the time series at each position should be sufficiently long to allow the computation of a significant fourier spectrum , we choose only the @xmath49 profiles for locations between @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "the values for @xmath0 are then scatter - plotted for each parameter , see figures [ fig : rho ] , [ fig : lc ] , and [ fig : sig ] . a smaller spread of period means that secondary waves are trapped by a randomly structured plasma in a more uniform manner , similar to the thermalization of collisional particles heated impulsively .    the dependence of @xmath0 on the density contrast @xmath2 is shown in figure  [ fig : rho ] , for which the values of the correlation length and initial pulse width are fixed at @xmath38 and @xmath69 , respectively . for small - amplitude pulses , given in figure  [ fig : rho](a ) ,",
    "the mean period does not vary significantly with the density contrast .",
    "however , the spread in @xmath0 is larger for larger values of @xmath2 . in the case of large - amplitude pulses , shown in figure  [ fig : rho](b )",
    ", the spread in @xmath0 tends to be stronger than for small - amplitude pulses .",
    "furthermore , this spread tends to first increase with increasing @xmath2 before decreasing when @xmath70 .",
    "this trend can be understood as follows .",
    "large - amplitude pulses can lead to non - restorable density perturbations ( ) , and therefore will enhance the density contrast if @xmath2 is weak .",
    "however , when @xmath2 is sufficiently strong , the passage of a nonlinear fast wave pulse has a smoothing effect .     for ( a ) small and ( b ) large amplitude pulses .",
    "these computations pertain to a fixed correlation length @xmath3 of @xmath71 , and a fixed initial pulse width @xmath1 of @xmath72 .",
    "[ fig : rho],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    figure  [ fig : lc ] shows the dependence of @xmath0 on the correlation length @xmath3 . in this set of experiments , we fix the density contrast at @xmath37 and vary the correlation length .",
    "furthermore , while both pertain to small - amplitude pulses , two different values for the initial pulse width ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) are examined and the results are shown in figures .",
    "[ fig : lc](a ) and [ fig : lc](b ) , respectively .",
    "it is clear that , regardless of @xmath1 , the mean period @xmath0 tends to depend linearly on @xmath3 . comparing figures .",
    "[ fig : lc](a ) and [ fig : lc](b ) , one sees that a narrow pulse is more sensitive to the variations in the correlation length . the period almost triples as @xmath3 doubles .",
    "in contrast , the increase in @xmath0 with @xmath3 for the broader pulse is not as strong .     and ( b ) @xmath75 .",
    "these computations pertain to a fixed density contrast @xmath2 of @xmath72 .",
    "[ fig : lc],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    how does @xmath0 depend on the initial pulse width @xmath1 ? to address this , we launch a set of pulses with different initial widths and investigate their propagation in two randomly structured plasmas with correlation lengths of @xmath76 and @xmath71 , respectively . the resonant energy loss effect ( ) is not prominent in the periodicity of the secondary waves .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : sig ] shows that broader pulses normally generate secondary waves with longer periods , which is more evident if @xmath3 is smaller .",
    "this is understandable given that when @xmath3 is small , fast pulses will be able to interact with the fine - scale inhomogeneities more frequently .     and ( b )",
    "@xmath77 are examined , even though both pertain to the same density contrast of @xmath78 .",
    "the vertical dashed lines mark where the initial pulse width matches @xmath3 and @xmath79 .",
    "[ fig : sig],scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "this study offered a series of numerical simulations on the propagation of fast mhd wave pulses in randomly structured plasmas mimicking the solar corona . while traversing the plasma inhomogeneities , fast wave pulses experience partial reflections , giving rise to secondary waves propagating in the opposite direction . in turn , these waves generate further waves , once again due to their partial reflection and transmission at plasma inhomogeneities .",
    "the end result is that , the energy contained in the primary fast pulses is spread over the randomly structured plasmas in the form of propagating and standing secondary waves .",
    "these secondary waves exhibit quasi - periodicities in both time and space .",
    "the spatial period at a given instant is related to the period observed at a fixed position via the fast wave speed .",
    "the interaction between fast wave pulses and the plasma inhomogeneities , as quantified by the average temporal period @xmath0 of secondary waves , turns out to depend primarily on the combination of parameters @xmath80 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are the density contrast and correlation length that characterize the equilibrium density profile .",
    "furthermore , @xmath1 is the initial width of the wave pulse . for small - amplitude pulses",
    ", @xmath2 does not have a significant effect on @xmath0 .",
    "rather , it determines the rapidness for @xmath0 to reach a uniform distribution .",
    "large - amplitude pulses , on the other hand , lead to non - restorable density perturbations , thereby enhancing the density contrast when @xmath2 is small but having a smoothing effect when @xmath2 is sufficiently large .",
    "the average period @xmath0 scales linearly with the correlation length , with the scaling factors being larger for narrower pulses .",
    "however , broader pulses can generate secondary waves with longer periods , the effect being stronger in random plasmas with shorter correlation lengths .",
