    "there has been renewed interest in recent years in boundary matter .",
    "general relativity , like newtonian gravitation , indicates that matter is the source for gravity .",
    "khoury and parikh @xcite asked the question whether the acceleration could be attributed to matter : where are energy and stresses localized as we could accelerate even in minkowski space ?",
    "we know that inertial frames exist even in the total absence of matter ( the matter distribution is encoded in the stress tensor ) .",
    "usually the boundary conditions for the metric are in the form of an induced metric and an extrinsic curvature for some hypersurface .",
    "the boundary matter concept appears , for example , in the so - called membrane paradigm for a black - hole s stretched horizon @xcite viewed as an inner boundary .",
    "it is worth noting that the gibbons - hawking term in the einstein - hilbert action is a surface integral over the outer boundary of spacetime .    as khoury and parikh",
    "have conjectured , ",
    "matter refers to both bulk and boundary stress tensors .",
    " they uniquely specify the geometry of spacetime .",
    "this may be recognized from the fact that the bulk stress tensor does not fully determine the riemann tensor which , besides the ricci tensor , contains the weyl tensor ( its free of a trace part ) .",
    "in addition , the weyl tensor is independent of matter .",
    "therefore , the authors of ref . 1 emphasized that , to determine the solutions of einstein s equations , one needs to add boundary conditions .",
    "other contexts where boundary matter arises are the brane - world scenarios , ads - cft correspondence @xcite , and the brown - york construction of a gravitational boundary stress tensor @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to compute the boundary stress tensors for a uniformly accelerating distribution of conformal rindler observers @xcite .",
    "our  boundary sources  are located on any @xmath6 hypersurface , where @xmath1 is the radial coordinate .",
    "as padmanabhan @xcite has observed , one can associate to the area @xmath7 of a spherical surface around a massive body the degrees of freedom corresponding to the entropy @xmath8 because observers at rest on the surface will have an acceleration produced by the body .",
    "in addition , for accelerated observers , one can , in principle , locate holographic screens ( equipotential surfaces ) anywhere in space @xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we introduce the conformally - flat rindler metric and its connection with minkowski s spacetime .",
    "we further depict the penrose diagram of the spacetime and its causal structure .",
    "section iii treats the kinematical parameters associated with a nongeodesic congruence of static observers in the same geometry , paying special attention to the observer s acceleration and its direct relation to the energy density located on a @xmath9 const .",
    "in addition , an unruh temperature is introduced , keeping in mind that a  static ",
    "observer is in fact accelerating .",
    "section iv is the main section of the paper . on the grounds of the parikh and wilczek s @xcite and eling and oz @xcite papers , we compute the energy momentum tensor on a @xmath10 timelike hypersurface and , from there , the surface energy density @xmath11 .",
    "we found that @xmath12 undergoes fluctuations near the planck world , changing even its sign at @xmath13 .",
    "a similar sign change takes place for the energy enclosed by a two surface @xmath14 of constant @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , @xmath14 is endowed with a positive - bulk - viscosity and negative - pressure newtonian fluid .",
    "the new effects found in this paper refer to the behavior of the acceleration @xmath15 of a static observer , the proper temperature associated to it , the surface energy density @xmath12 on a @xmath10 hypersurface and the energy @xmath16 enclosed by the 2 - surface @xmath17 .",
    "all of them vanish at @xmath18 ( the planck length ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath19 and @xmath16 experience a sign change for that value of @xmath1 . throughout the paper",
    "we use the geometrical units @xmath20 .",
    "we introduce in this section the conformal rindler observer in spherical coordinates , emphasizing the special role played by the conformal factor .",
    "as we shall see , far from the planck world ( @xmath21 ) , the geometry is an ordinary rindler space in spherical coordinates .",
    "therefore , it is worth studying the boundary stress tensors in this geometry and seeing what new effects arise due to the presence of the conformal factor .",
    "let us consider the 4 - dimensional subspace of the witten bubble spacetime @xcite @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 being constants and @xmath25 being the metric on the unit 2 - sphere .",
    "the metric in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is the ordinary minkowski space provided @xmath26 , but written in spherical rindler coordinates @xcite .",
    "the spherical distribution of uniformly accelerated observers with the rest - system acceleration @xmath24 uses this type of hyperbolically expanding coordinates .",
    "the singularity at @xmath27 is only a coordinate singularity , as can be seen from the isotropical form of eq .",
    "( 1 ) with the help of a new radial coordinate @xmath1 @xmath28 therefore , the spacetime in eq . ( 1 ) now appears as @xmath29 as cho and pak @xcite have observed , the singularity at @xmath30 is a coordinate singularity because the curvature invariant @xmath31 and the kretschmann scalar @xmath32 are finite there .",
    "therefore , the conformally flat metric in eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be interpreted as an instanton - antiinstanton pair in conformal gravity @xcite .",
    "we note that the coordinate transformation @xmath33 changes the previous metric to @xmath34 which is conformally flat ( @xmath35 and the greek indices run from @xmath36 to @xmath37 ) , and @xmath38 . from now on we take the constant @xmath23 to be of the order of the planck length .",
    "let us observe that the geometry in eq .",
    "( 3 ) becomes flat provided @xmath39 ( the conformal factor tends to unity ) or @xmath40 when the first term in the conformal factor may be neglected .",
    "therefore , eq . ( 3 ) represents the lorentzian version of the euclidean hawking wormhole @xcite @xcite .",
    "figure 1 gives the @xmath10 trajectories for the metric in eq .",
    "( 3 ) without the conformal factor , in minkowski @xmath41 coordinates .",
    "they are the hyperbolae @xmath42 with the null cones @xmath43 as asymptotes and with acceleration @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 const .",
    "curves are straight lines through the origin .",
    "the stretched horizon @xmath46 corresponds to @xmath47 .",
    "it is a timelike surface infinitesimally away from the event horizon @xmath30 . in other words",
    ", any @xmath10 hyperbola becomes a stretched horizon when @xmath48 ( it approaches the event horizon in this case @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to treat the region @xmath49 by means of the transformation @xmath50 inserting eq .",
    "( 6 ) in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we conclude that the metric in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is invariant under the inversion in eq .",
    "therefore , we may say that the @xmath49 region is the image of the @xmath51 region obtained by using the inversion .",
    "this can be seen by constructing the conformal ( penrose ) diagram corresponding to the geometry in eq .",
    "we use the fact that the causal structure of a spacetime is unchanged by conformal compactification @xcite .",
    "let us write the conformal metric in eq .",
    "( 3 ) in the form @xmath52 .",
    "\\label{7}\\ ] ] the function @xmath53 tends to zero when @xmath1 approaches infinity , so all points at infinity in the geometry of eq .",
    "( 7 ) can be brought at a finite distance in the new metric @xmath54 @xcite . discarding the conformal factor @xmath55 , the new",
    "metric becomes @xmath56 where @xmath57 ; that is , @xmath58 , where convenient initial conditions were used ( @xmath59 at @xmath18 ) .",
    "one observes that @xmath60 when @xmath21 and that @xmath61 when @xmath62 .",
    "we also note that the null geodesic @xmath63 @xcite becomes @xmath64 for the time - dependent rindler metric in eq .",
    "we now compactify the spacetime in eq .",
    "( 8) by means of the new variables @xmath65 with finite ranges for the coordinates @xmath66 , namely , @xmath67 .",
    "the metric in eq .",
    "( 8) appears now as @xmath68 the penrose diagram is depicted in fig .",
    "2 ( any point in the diagram is an expanding 2-sphere ) .",
    "the right half corresponds to @xmath69 , and the left half to @xmath70 .",
    "we observe that the diagram has no horizons .",
    "we know that the spacetime in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is not a solution of the vacuum einstein s equations .",
    "therefore , a source was introduced on the right - hand side @xcite in order for eq .",
    "( 3 ) to become an exact solution .",
    "let us consider now ",
    "static  observers in the spacetime of eq .",
    "their 4 - velocity field is given by @xmath71 the scalar expansion @xmath72 associated with @xmath73 appears as @xmath74 it is always finite and varies between @xmath75 and @xmath76 when @xmath77 .",
    "the acceleration vector of the fluid world lines is given by @xmath78 with @xmath79 it is worth noting that @xmath80 , from eq .",
    "( 13 ) , changes its sign at @xmath18 .",
    "this is in accordance with the interpretation of the surface @xmath18 as a domain wall and with the fact that @xmath11 changes sign when the domain wall is crossed .",
    "one can associate to the hyperbolic ( @xmath81 observer in the accelerated system a temperature @xmath82 given by @xmath83 according to unruh s formula . even though the @xmath30 hypersurface is no longer a horizon - compared to the @xmath84 case ( the geometry in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is time dependent and there is no a timelike killing vector ) , we might formally construct a  surface gravity  as @xmath85 let us note that abreu and visser @xcite defined a generalized surface gravity valid not only for a black - hole horizon but also for a sphere of arbitrary radius .",
    "the expression is also compatible with that for a time - dependent , spherically - symmetric situation , as in our case . +",
    "our uniformly accelerating system is not static .",
    "however , for @xmath21 or @xmath62 , the  proper  temperature @xmath86 obeys the tolman relation @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath86 is measured by a local observer .",
    "a temperature gradient is necessary to prevent heat to flow from regions with different gravitational potentials .",
    "we have , indeed , @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is given by eq .",
    "( 13 ) , @xmath90 is the coefficient of thermal conductivity and @xmath91 is the spacelike heat flux .",
    "the shear tensor of the flow , @xmath92 has the nonzero components @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the projection tensor in the direction perpendicular to @xmath73 .",
    "however , the rotation tensor @xmath95 is vanishing .",
    "the time - evolution of the scalar expansion is given by the raychaudhuri equation @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the parameter along the world lines .",
    "the ricci tensor is defined by @xmath98 , and @xmath99 keeping in mind that @xmath100 one obtains for the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( 20 ) , the expression @xmath101 , but @xmath102 for the metric in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is given by @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "using eq . ( 11 ) we find that the raychaudhuri equation is satisfied .",
    "from the surface source term in the gravitational action , we know that the following energy - momentum tensor emerges @xcite @xmath104 where @xmath105 refers to the  surface ,  @xmath106 is the extrinsic curvature tensor corresponding to @xmath107 const .",
    "timelike hypersurface , @xmath108 is its trace and @xmath109 is the induced metric given by @xmath110 the 4 - vector normal to the surface has the components @xmath111 , where @xmath112 . with the help of the well - known expression @xmath113 one obtains @xmath114 and the trace gives us @xmath115 equation ( 23 )",
    "now yields @xmath116 we see that the energy - momentum tensor is proportional to the metric tensor : @xmath117 we have , therefore , @xmath118 where @xmath11 is the surface energy density and @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the pressures ( tensions for @xmath69 ) on the angular directions .",
    "note that , far from the planck world ( @xmath121 . as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath122 vanishes at @xmath30 and @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in cartesian coordinates ,",
    "these correspond to the light cones @xmath123 and the hyperbolic trajectories @xmath124 , respectively .    at @xmath125",
    ", we have @xmath126 and at @xmath127 , one obtains @xmath128 @xmath122 is positive for @xmath51 and negative for @xmath129 .",
    "the region around @xmath18 acts as a domain wall of thickness @xmath130 .",
    "the fluctuations of the surface energy are completely negligible far from planck s world .",
    "let us also observe that @xmath15 from eq .",
    "( 14 ) obeys the relation @xmath131 in accordance with the gauss law .",
    "a similar expression has been obtained in ref .",
    "22 for the rindler horizon in cartesian coordinates .",
    "for example , with @xmath132 , we obtain @xmath133 .",
    "one means our hyperbolic observer , located at @xmath134 from the origin , perceives an enormous surface energy density .",
    "however , we must remember that the acceleration is also very large . on the contrary",
    ", we have @xmath135 for @xmath136   ( with @xmath137 ) .",
    "we find now the energy @xmath16 enclosed by the 2 - surface @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the metric tensor on h is @xmath140 the energy is obtained from @xmath141 with @xmath142 and @xmath11 from eq .",
    "( 30 ) , eq .",
    "( 35 ) yields @xmath143 taken at @xmath10 and @xmath144 .",
    "it is worth noting here that @xmath16 becomes negative for @xmath70 and changes its sign under the inversion in eq .",
    "( 6 ) .    by means of the padmanabhan formula @xmath145 @xcite ,",
    "one obtains for the entropy @xmath0 corresponding to the degrees of freedom on @xmath14 ( or adopting the holographic principle in the space enclosed by h ) @xmath146 hence , @xmath8 , where @xmath7 is the area of @xmath14 .",
    "this expression corresponds exactly to the horizon entropy of a black hole .",
    "that is not surprising since the @xmath147 const .",
    "observer is at rest in the accelerated system , which is equivalent to a gravitational field .",
    "as padmanabhan has noticed , one can construct a local rindler observer who will perceive the timelike @xmath10 surface as a stretched horizon .",
    "the unruh temperature on this surface will be @xmath148 , the constant @xmath24 playing the role of the surface gravity .",
    "in addition , we can check that the expression in eq .",
    "( 36 ) is in accordance with the equipartition law @xcite @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the number of elementary cells of area @xmath151 ( @xmath152 - the planck length ) .",
    "padmanabhan s formula applies here for @xmath69 ; otherwise , @xmath16 acquires a negative value .",
    "the case @xmath70 is not compatible with the statistical interpretation when the minimal area cell is @xmath153 .",
    "the metric tensor @xmath154 of the spacelike 2 - section @xmath14 of the constant @xmath1 hypersurfaces , to which the velocity vector @xmath155 is normal , is given by ( see eq . ( 34 ) ) @xmath156 we may decompose the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath157 of @xmath14 into a traceless part and a trace part @xcite : @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are , respectively , the shear tensor and the expansion of the surface elements .",
    "using the components of the metric given by eq .",
    "( 39 ) , we immediately find that @xmath159 is vanishing and that @xmath160 appears as @xmath161 which is the same as eq .",
    "therefore , the 2-surface stress tensor @xmath162 has two nonzero components : @xmath163    a comparison with a viscous newtonian fluid leads to @xmath164 , where @xmath4 stands for the bulk viscosity coefficient . in other words , on the 2 - surface @xmath14 , the pressure @xmath165 is negative .",
    "therefore , it acts as a surface tension . in spite of the fact that the authors of refs .",
    "1 , 3 , and 23 obtained a negative value for @xmath4 , our result is different because the 2 - surface h is not lightlike .",
    "we consider in this paper a uniformly - accelerated distribution of conformal rindler observers and compute the stress tensors on 3 - and 2 - surfaces viewed as boundaries of spacetime . to any @xmath10 static observer in the accelerated system , we may associate a temperature proportional to its acceleration because a local rindler observer will perceive the timelike surface as a stretched horizon .",
    "we have calculated the energy enclosed by a 2 - surface @xmath14 of constant @xmath1 and @xmath2 and have found that it obeys the equipartition law @xmath166 .",
    "in addition , we have established that the entropy obtained from padmanabhan s formula @xmath167 corresponds to the horizon of a black hole .",
    "that supports our view that @xmath10 observers are equivalent to those located near the black hole s horizon , where the geometry is of a rindler type @xcite .",
    "the stress tensor on @xmath14 corresponds to a newtonian viscous fluid with a bulk viscosity @xmath164 , leading to a negative pressure that acts as a surface tension .",
