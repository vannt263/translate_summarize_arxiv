    "understanding how the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) could have arisen from matter ",
    "antimatter symmetric initial conditions remains a central challenge at the interface between high energy physics and cosmology .",
    "the observed light element abundances , combined with the theory of big bang nucleosynthesis , yield the constraint that the ratio of the cosmological baryon number density to the cosmological entropy density lies in the range @xmath0@xcite . as has been understood since the work of sakharov@xcite , a theory that explains the generation of a net baryon asymmetry must include departures from thermal equilibrium , and must include processes that violate baryon number conservation , charge conjugation symmetry c , and cp symmetry , the product of charge conjugation and parity symmetry p. these conditions can be satisfied by electroweak processes in the early universe , raising the possibility of an electroweak explanation of the bau[3 - 28 ] . in particular , sakharov s requirements are all satisfied during a first order electroweak phase transition[7 - 26 ] . as the universe cools through the transition temperature @xmath1 ,",
    "non - equilibrium conditions exist near the bubble walls that are sweeping through the universe , converting the high temperature `` symmetric '' phase to the low temperature `` broken '' phase .",
    "that is smoothly connected to the equilibrium phase at @xmath2 as the symmetric phase , and the phase at @xmath3 that is smoothly connected to the equilibrium phase at @xmath4 as the broken phase , even though there is in fact no distinction between the symmetry of the two phases . ]",
    "baryon number is violated in the electroweak theory as a consequence of the anomaly@xcite in processes in which the sphaleron barrier is traversed@xcite .",
    "the rate for baryon number violating processes is exponentially small at zero temperature and in the broken phase at the critical temperature @xmath1 , but not in the symmetric phase@xcite .",
    "c is maximally violated in the electroweak theory , and cp violation enters via the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "meeting sakharov s conditions , as the minimal standard model does , is necessary for generating a cosmological baryon asymmetry , but need not be sufficient for generating an asymmetry as large as that observed . indeed , in order to explain the observed bau , it appears that one needs to extend the standard model for at least two reasons .",
    "first , although mechanisms using cp violation from the ckm matrix alone have been constructed , they seem to be unable to generate the observed bau .",
    "hence , cp violation beyond that in the standard model seems to be required .",
    "second , regardless of the mechanism by which baryon number is generated , if it is to survive after the electroweak phase transition , baryon number violating processes must be sufficiently suppressed for @xmath4 .",
    "this imposes a lower bound on the expectation value of the higgs field in the broken phase at @xmath3@xcite which is not satisfied in the standard model with an experimentally allowed higgs mass .",
    "this bound can , however , be satisfied in various extensions of the standard model , including the minimal supersymmetric standard model with one top squark lighter than the top quark@xcite ; throughout this paper , we will assume that the theory is suitably augmented such that the transition is strongly enough first order that the bound is satisfied .",
    "since the energies that are potentially relevant to electroweak baryogenesis will be increasingly explored in the coming decade by present and planned accelerators , it is of great interest to explore new weak - scale physics that can explain the observed bau .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new mechanism for generating the bau at the electroweak phase transition .",
    "our mechanism requires augmenting the standard model by the addition of ( at least ) two baryon number carrying complex scalar fields @xmath5 and @xmath6 with masses of @xmath7 .",
    "the two fields must be coupled by off - diagonal terms in their ( hermitian ) mass - squared matrix @xmath8 which include a cp violating phase . in this way",
    ", we introduce cp violation beyond that in the ckm matrix .",
    "furthermore , we require that @xmath8 depend upon the higgs field expectation values in the theory so that the mass eigenvalues and eigenstates are different in the symmetric and broken phases .",
    "the requirements just sketched can be implemented in a variety of extensions of the standard model .",
    "perhaps the most appealing possibility is that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the @xmath9 singlet and @xmath9 doublet top squarks in a supersymmetric extension of the standard model .",
    "another possibility , of interest in light of the recent hera anomaly@xcite , is that @xmath5 and @xmath6 may be weak - scale leptoquarks whose masses receive contributions from couplings to the higgs field . throughout this paper",
    ", we focus on the baryogenesis mechanism rather than on model building . for definiteness",
    ", however , we present our mechanism and results taking the @xmath10 s to be squarks , and defer discussion of other possibilities to the concluding section .    in a supersymmetric theory , the mass - squared matrix @xmath8 depends upon @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the temperature dependent expectation values of the two higgs doublets @xmath13 and @xmath14 that give mass to the down and up type quarks , respectively .",
    "the off - diagonal terms in @xmath8 are in fact zero in the symmetric phase , where @xmath15 . in the broken phase ,",
    "the off - diagonal terms are complex and therefore cp violating .",
    "more generally , we define @xmath5 and @xmath6 as the eigenvectors of @xmath8 in the symmetric phase , and note that the mass eigenstates in the wall and in the broken phase are linear combinations thereof .    we will be interested in the reflection and transmission probabilities of @xmath10 s incident on the wall from the symmetric phase . because of the cp violating phases in @xmath8 , the probability @xmath16 for an incident @xmath5 to be reflected back into the symmetric phase as a @xmath6 is not the same as @xmath17 , the probability for an incident antiparticle @xmath18 to be reflected as a @xmath19 .",
    "we will show that this reflection asymmetry @xmath20 results in a net flux of baryon number from the bubble wall into the symmetric phase , compensated by a flux of the opposite sign into the broken phase .",
    "note that the measure of cp violation in the model is the spatial variation of the phase of the off - diagonal terms in @xmath8 .",
    "a spatially constant phase can be rotated away by a spacetime - independent unitary transformation on the @xmath21 ; hence the phase must vary spatially if @xmath22 is to be nonzero .",
    "the central observation of this paper is that the reflection asymmetry @xmath22 can be large , approaching 1 , over a broad range of incident energies , if the phase of the off - diagonal term in @xmath8 changes by @xmath23 as the bubble wall is traversed from the symmetric phase into the broken phase . as already noted , because of the dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the eigenvalues of @xmath8 vary within the bubble wall .",
    "we assume that the larger of the two eigenvalues in the broken phase is greater than the larger of the two eigenvalues in the symmetric phase .",
    "this means that there is in general a range of incident energies @xmath26 such that in the symmetric phase , both eigenvalues of @xmath8 are below @xmath27 , while in the broken phase , there is only one eigenvalue below @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , there are two propagating modes with energy @xmath26 in the symmetric phase and only one in the broken phase . consider a @xmath5 incident upon the wall from the symmetric phase with an energy in this range .",
    "as it begins to penetrate the wall , it evolves into a linear combination of the position - dependent eigenstates of the matrix @xmath8 .",
    "since only one mode can propagate in the broken phase , there is a position within the wall at which one mode is totally reflected .",
    "the reflected mode , upon re - emerging into the symmetric phase , is some linear combination of @xmath5 and @xmath6 which includes a significant @xmath6 component if there is significant mixing .",
    "another way of understanding what is special about the range of energy under discussion is that at each energy in this range , there is one linear combination of incident @xmath5 and @xmath6 that is totally reflected . for this reason ,",
    "both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are generically large , and @xmath22 is also large unless the cp violating phase is small",
    ". we will refer to this range of incident energies as the `` enhanced reflection zone . '' by comparison , for incident energies above the enhanced reflection zone , for which there are two propagating modes in both the symmetric and broken phases and throughout the bubble wall , we find that @xmath22 is nonzero but is generically many orders of magnitude smaller than one .",
    "the width in energy of the enhanced reflection zone is comparable to the amount by which the masses change between the two phases ; in the example we present , the width of the enhanced reflection zone is @xmath28 gev . in section",
    "ii , we present the parametrization of @xmath8 appearing in a supersymmetric theory .",
    "we then set up the calculation of @xmath22 , leaving a detailed presentation of the method of calculation to the appendix .",
    "we evaluate @xmath22 and explore its dependence on parameters in @xmath8 .",
    "standard model quarks also have an enhanced reflection zone , as discussed by farrar and shaposhnikov , although its width is only of order the strange quark mass .",
    "the resulting bau is small , essentially because the light quarks have mean free paths much shorter than their compton wavelengths .",
    "we defer to section iv a discussion of the suppression due to the finite mean free path of the heavy scalars we employ in our mechanism ; the suppression is not severe .    in section iii ,",
    "we integrate @xmath22 against the appropriate thermal distributions for incident @xmath5 s and @xmath6 s to obtain the baryon number flux injected into the symmetric phase .",
    "if the wall velocity @xmath29 is zero , or if the masses of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the symmetric phase are equal , we find that the baryon number flux due to incident @xmath5 s is cancelled by that due to incident @xmath6 s .",
    "as long as @xmath30 and the masses in the symmetric phase are not degenerate , we obtain a nonzero baryon number flux .",
    "the larger the fraction of the thermal distributions for incident @xmath10 s lying in the enhanced reflection zone , the larger the baryon number flux will be .",
    "the final element in the mechanism involves electroweak baryon number violating processes .",
    "these drive the baryon number density in the symmetric phase toward zero .",
    "because they do not act in the broken phase , the final result is a net baryon asymmetry of the universe whose magnitude we estimate in section iv .",
    "our mechanism yields a bau consistent with observation if the scalars have nondegenerate masses of order @xmath1 in the symmetric phase and if the bubble walls are sufficiently thin and slow .",
    "we discuss open questions and model implementations in section v , and note there that an enhanced reflection zone can arise in leptoquark models , and thus is not peculiar to supersymmetric theories .    to close this introduction , we contrast our mechanism with the charge transport mechanism , pioneered by cohen , kaplan and nelson@xcite , further developed by many authors , and used to estimate the bau generated during the electroweak phase transition in supersymmetric theories[19,23 - 26 ] .",
    "our mechanism can be seen as a modification of the charge transport mechanism .",
    "we make explicit comparisons with the results of huet and nelson@xcite obtained using the charge transport mechanism and find that our mechanism can yield an @xmath31 consistent with observation for smaller cp violating phases .",
    "the central difference is that in our mechanism , we generate a flux of baryon number into the symmetric phase , whereas in the charge transport mechanism a flux of another quantum number , often left - handed baryon number minus right - handed baryon number , is generated .",
    "this axial baryon number can be washed out by qcd processes before it has time to bias electroweak baryon number violating processes@xcite . because our mechanism generates a baryon number flux , it is immune to qcd interference of this kind .. ] this contrast is particularly germane in light of the recent demonstration that the rates for the relevant qcd processes are significantly larger than previously expected@xcite .",
    "various authors have noted the possibility that a baryon number flux may be generated , but this has always been assumed to be a small effect .",
    "this is in fact true for incident energies such that the number of propagating modes is the same on both sides of the bubble wall . for a generic mass - squared matrix @xmath8 ,",
    "however , there is a broad region of incident energies in which fewer modes propagate in the broken phase .",
    "we observe that this leads to large reflection asymmetries , and consequently to a large baryon number flux into the symmetric phase , yielding an efficient mechanism for generating a bau consistent with cosmological observations during the electroweak phase transition .",
    "we will refer to the electroweak baryogenesis mechanism we propose as the scalar baryon number transport mechanism .",
    "we begin this section by presenting the parametrization of @xmath8 appropriate when @xmath5 and @xmath6 are left- and right - handed top squarks and set the stage for the calculation of @xmath22 .",
    "we then describe the dependence of @xmath22 upon the incident energy and upon parameters in @xmath8 .    as discussed in the introduction , the cp violation that we exploit results from the mixing between two scalars as they traverse the bubble wall separating regions of symmetric and broken phase at @xmath3 . in this background , terms in the potential that couple the baryon number carrying scalars @xmath21 to the higgs fields @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "give the @xmath21 spacetime ",
    "dependent masses and mixings which can be encoded in a @xmath32 hermitian mass matrix . in a supersymmetric theory ,",
    "the scalars @xmath21 are squarks . top squarks ( stops ) are the most promising candidates to play the role we envision for the @xmath21 s because they can be light without violating experimental upper bounds on neutron and electron electric dipole moments ( edms ) .",
    "indeed , cohen , kaplan , and nelson have recently advocated supersymmetric models in which cp violating phases are @xmath23 , but observable edms do not arise because the first and second generation squarks have masses in the tens of tev@xcite .",
    "although it is conceivable that the scalar baryon number transport mechanism could be implemented using first or second generation squarks , it seems likely that stops will yield the largest contribution to the bau .",
    "the stop mass matrix is@xcite @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the top quark mass , @xmath35 is the @xmath36-boson mass squared , @xmath37 is the soft susy - breaking mass for the @xmath9 singlet stop , @xmath38 is the soft susy - breaking mass for the @xmath9 doublet stop , @xmath39 is the ratio of the higgs field expectation values , @xmath40 is the ( complex ) mass in the higgs potential coupling the two higgs fields , and @xmath41 is a complex soft susy - breaking term .",
    "we will see that the scalar baryon number transport mechanism works best if @xmath38 and @xmath37 are both @xmath7 and differ by about 10 - 30% .",
    "mass differences of this order can arise due to renormalization group evolution down from some high energy scale at which @xmath42 . indeed , in the models of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath38 and @xmath37 differ by 20% .    during most of the existence of the expanding bubble ,",
    "its wall can be treated as flat because its radius of curvature is much larger than its thickness , so the mass matrix will depend only upon one spatial direction , which we take to be the @xmath43 direction .",
    "we choose the convention that the region of large negative @xmath43 is the symmetric phase and that of large positive @xmath43 is the broken phase .",
    "both @xmath24 and @xmath25 vary across the bubble wall .",
    "a complete calculation of these profiles is beyond the scope of this paper , although a treatment using the resummed one - loop temperature - dependent effective potential is possible@xcite . as is conventional ,",
    "we make a simple choice in terms of a single width parameter , hoping that this captures the essential physics . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose profiles such that the @xmath44 are @xmath43-independent for @xmath45 and @xmath46 and are sinusoids for @xmath47 .",
    "that is , we define the profile function @xmath48 and then for @xmath24 , we take @xmath49 which varies smoothly from zero in the symmetric phase at @xmath50 to @xmath51 in the broken phase at @xmath52 .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 characterizes the width of the wall separating the two phases .",
    "although in reality the profiles behave exponentially for @xmath54 , most of the interesting physics happens where @xmath43 is varying most rapidly and @xmath55 is as good a parametrization as any .",
    "the choice ( [ profile ] ) is convenient numerically , as it allows us to impose boundary conditions at @xmath56 rather than at larger @xmath57 .",
    "it is crucial to our mechanism that @xmath58 vary across the bubble wall so that the overall phase of the off - diagonal term in @xmath8 is not constant .",
    "we take @xmath59 \\label{betaprofile}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that @xmath60 varies from @xmath61 in the symmetric phase to @xmath62 in the broken phase .",
    "we will take @xmath63 in our estimates .",
    "our results do not depend sensitively on this choice .",
    "the appropriate choice for @xmath51 in ( [ v1profile ] ) is _ not _",
    "@xmath64 , the value it takes at @xmath65 , but rather the value it takes in the broken phase at @xmath3 . this can be calculated as a function of parameters in specific models , but we will simply use the reasonable estimate @xmath66 .",
    "( our results do not depend sensitively on the choice of prefactor . ) in order for the baryon asymmetry generated ( by any mechanism ) during the electroweak phase transition not to be wiped out , @xmath67 must be larger than @xmath68 .",
    "estimates for @xmath69 exist in specific models and range from @xmath70@xcite to @xmath71@xcite , but there are certainly no experimental constraints on this parameter . in order for the overall phase of the off - diagonal terms in @xmath8 to vary with @xmath43 , that is , in order for @xmath8 to introduce cp violating effects , we must have @xmath72 edm experiments may constrain @xmath73 in some models@xcite , but it has recently been noted@xcite that in other models @xmath74 is constrained to be small while @xmath75 is essentially unconstrained . any constraints on the cp violating phases are weakened if the first and second generation squarks are heavy . finally , note that @xmath75 can be generation - dependent . hence",
    ", there is no model - independent constraint on @xmath73 for third generation squarks .",
    "= 3.5 in    as a concrete example which will serve as a visual aid for much of our subsequent discussion , in figure 1 , we plot the eigenvalues of @xmath8 as a function of @xmath43 for the parameter set @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , that is @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . with these parameters , the zero temperature masses of the two top squarks are @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in our example , we take the wall width to be @xmath88 . although the critical temperature @xmath1 and the wall velocity @xmath29 play no role in the calculation of @xmath22 , we mention for completeness that when they enter in the next section , we will use @xmath89 and @xmath90 as representative values .",
    "it is conventional to write the wall width in terms of the temperature , that is , @xmath91 in our example .",
    "henceforth , we write @xmath1 as @xmath92 when it causes no ambiguity .",
    "the final relevant parameter is the @xmath10 mean free path @xmath93 , which will appear in section iv where we estimate @xmath94 .",
    "this completes the enumeration of the parameters specifying the `` canonical '' example for which we will quote results in the following .",
    "we will , of course , describe the effects of varying each of these parameters at appropriate points in the discussion .",
    "we wish to follow a @xmath10 particle from the thermal ensemble in the symmetric phase that last scattered somewhere away from the wall and is now incident upon the wall .",
    "implicit in this scenario is the assumption that the mean free path of the scalars in the plasma is long compared to the wall width @xmath53 .",
    "this assumption is likely false , but we nevertheless use it in this section and the next , deferring our treatment of the suppression due to finite mean free paths for the @xmath10 particles to section iv .",
    "the particle impinges upon the wall and is reflected or transmitted , and then resumes its thermal motion in the plasma on one side of the wall or the other . during the time between the last scattering before reflection or transmission and the first after , the particle propagates freely , feeling only the changing expectation values of the higgs fields which are encoded in the mass matrix .",
    "we calculate the reflection coefficients and their asymmetry in the rest frame of the wall ; we will boost the resulting baryon number flux to the plasma frame when we calculate it in section iii . in the wall frame ,",
    "energy is conserved upon traversing the wall since the mass matrix is time - independent .",
    "the reflection coefficients can be calculated by solving the time independent klein - gordon equations @xmath95",
    "\\phi_j({\\bf x } ) = 0   \\label{kg}\\ ] ] because the time dependence of solutions is simply an overall @xmath96 . in general",
    ", we will take a basis in @xmath5 and @xmath6 such that far from the wall in the symmetric phase , @xmath8 is diagonal .",
    "this has already been accomplished , since @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the only terms in ( [ squarkmass ] ) which are nonzero in the symmetric phase .",
    "when calculating the baryon number flux in section iii , we will consider particles incident upon the wall with momenta that are not perpendicular to the wall .",
    "however , their reflection coefficients will depend only upon the component of their momentum that is perpendicular to the wall ; hence , it suffices to compute reflection coefficients for normal incidence .",
    "therefore , the problem of finding reflection coefficients is effectively a one - dimensional scattering problem , and equations ( [ kg ] ) become ordinary differential equations for @xmath99 .",
    "consider the mass matrix whose eigenvalues are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the behavior of the reflection coefficients is qualitatively different for particles incident from the symmetric phase with energies @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 . for @xmath100 , there is only one propagating mode in both the symmetric and the broken phases . in general , we denote the reflection coefficient for a @xmath21 from the symmetric phase reflected back into the symmetric phase as a @xmath103 by @xmath104 for particles , and denote the corresponding quantity for antiparticles by @xmath105 .",
    "for @xmath100 , however , the only reflection coefficients are @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "since the cpt conjugate of the reflection of @xmath5 to @xmath5 is the reflection of @xmath108 to @xmath108 , we see that @xmath109 , and there is no reflection asymmetry . before proceeding to higher energies , note that for a different mass matrix it may be the case that @xmath110 . in this case , for @xmath111 there are two propagating modes in the symmetric phase and none in the broken phase , so both @xmath5 and @xmath6 must be totally reflected .",
    "we now argue that in this circumstance , the reflection coefficients again can not be cp violating .",
    "unitarity implies that for total reflection , @xmath112 we see that unitarity , together with @xmath109 , implies that @xmath113 and hence there is no reflection asymmetry . for the rest of this paper , it is implicit that references to @xmath114 should be replaced by references to @xmath115 if the mass matrix is such that @xmath110 .",
    "we have shown that particles incident from the symmetric phase with energy @xmath100 yield no reflection asymmetry .",
    "now consider incident energies @xmath101 , for which there are two propagating modes in the symmetric phase and only one in the broken phase .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , for any energy in this shaded range there is a point @xmath116 at which the larger eigenvalue of @xmath8 equals @xmath27 .",
    "this means that there is a particular linear combination of incident @xmath5 and @xmath6 that evolves by mixing as it propagates through the wall in just such a way that upon arrival at @xmath116 it is purely in the mass eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath27 , and is therefore totally reflected .",
    "since one linear combination of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is totally reflected by the wall , both @xmath16 and @xmath117 are large in this energy range , given sufficient mixing . in order to obtain large asymmetries between the reflection coefficients for particles and for antiparticles ,",
    "the individual reflection coefficients must of course be large , making this zone of enhanced reflection a promising place to look for large @xmath22 . without cp violation , the same linear combination of incident @xmath18 and incident @xmath19 mixes to become the mode with eigenvalue @xmath27 at @xmath116 , and",
    "is totally reflected .",
    "this implies that @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "however , if the off - diagonal term in @xmath8 has a spatially varying phase , then the linear combination of @xmath120 s that is totally reflected is different from that for the @xmath10 s , and we expect @xmath121 , as we confirm explicitly below .    before proceeding , note that @xmath122 by cpt and therefore @xmath123 this simplifies calculations by giving the reflection asymmetry in terms of reflection coefficients for particles only .",
    "another simplification is that in the enhanced reflection zone , @xmath22 is the only possible asymmetry because there is no asymmetry due to particles incident from the broken phase .",
    "denoting the single propagating mode in the broken phase by @xmath124 , since @xmath125 by cpt , unitarity requires that incident @xmath124 s can not yield baryon number asymmetric transmission into the symmetric phase .",
    "we give a careful explanation of the calculation of @xmath22 in the appendix ; henceforth in this section , we focus solely on the results .",
    "= 3.5 in    in figure 2 , we plot @xmath22 vs. incident energy @xmath26 for two values of the wall width , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , with all other parameters as in our canonical example .",
    "the enhanced reflection zone is apparent , with @xmath128 for @xmath126 .",
    "even greater values of @xmath22 are obtained for @xmath69 and @xmath73 that are larger than our canonical values .",
    "( for example , for @xmath129 and @xmath130 , we find @xmath131 . )",
    "we have therefore confirmed that in the enhanced reflection zone , large reflection coefficients yield large reflection asymmetries in the presence of @xmath23 cp violating phases . for incident energies below the enhanced reflection zone , @xmath132 . at higher energies , that is for @xmath102 , there are two propagating modes in both the symmetric and the broken phases and throughout the wall . in this regime ,",
    "@xmath121 , but it is extremely small . for @xmath126 , @xmath133 at @xmath134 ; @xmath135 at @xmath136 ; and @xmath137 at @xmath138 . for these energies ,",
    "transmission coefficients are very close to @xmath139 and reflection coefficients ( and therefore @xmath22 ) are very small .    for energies above @xmath140 ,",
    "unlike for those in the enhanced reflection zone , there is the possibility of a nonzero asymmetry arising from particles and antiparticles incident from the broken phase and transmitted through the wall into the symmetric phase .",
    "this asymmetry is very small , as we now argue .",
    "just as the @xmath104 are very small in this energy range , the reflection coefficients for reflection of particles incident from the broken phase back into the broken phase are very small also .",
    "since any asymmetry associated with transmission into the symmetric phase must be balanced by an asymmetry in reflection , we conclude that even though the transmission coefficients are @xmath141 , their asymmetry is very small .",
    "= 3.5 in",
    "we now discuss the dependence of @xmath22 on the parameters in the problem , beginning with the wall width @xmath53 . note that in order to obtain a nonzero @xmath22 , there must be some region in @xmath43 in which modes incident from the symmetric phase can mix , and hence feel the effects of the cp violating terms , before arriving at @xmath116 where one mode is totally reflected .",

    "this in turn leads to a quark baryon number density which biases the electroweak sphaleron processes acting in the symmetric phase , resulting in a net baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "before the wall arrives , the @xmath10 s in the symmetric phase are diffusing about with a mean free path in the @xmath43 direction which we call @xmath93 and a mean velocity in the @xmath43 direction between scatterings which we call @xmath235 . the one - dimensional diffusion constant",

    "joyce , prokopec , and turok@xcite have estimated that in the symmetric phase , the diffusion constant for relativistic strongly interacting particles is @xmath239 .",
    "most of the scatterings contributing to @xmath240 are interactions with gluons in the plasma , and @xmath240 is inversely proportional to the relevant interaction cross - section which decreases with increasing @xmath148 .",

    "we see that for @xmath245 , the flux @xmath178 is suppressed by about a factor of @xmath246 relative to that for infinite @xmath93 .",
    "we have also verified that the reflection asymmetries at a given energy are largely insensitive to the form of the potential beyond the corresponding @xmath116 .",
    "although our method of including the effects of a finite mean free path is certainly not the final word , it should give a reasonable estimate of the magnitude of the suppression .",

    "this may be justifiable for @xmath317 , and we therefore compare our results with those they obtain using this parameter set . for their other set of parameters , which has @xmath318 , @xmath319 , their @xmath8 has one negative eigenvalue in the broken phase , rendering comparison to results they obtain with these parameters difficult . ] namely @xmath317 , @xmath319 and @xmath320 they find a contribution to the bau due to stops using the charge transport mechanism given by @xmath321 . just as @xmath290 parametrizes the rate for electroweak baryon number violating processes , @xmath322 parametrizes the rate for strong axial baryon number violating processes .",
    "the factor @xmath323 is conventionally taken to be @xmath141 , but the work of moore@xcite suggests that it is in fact smaller . for @xmath270 , the bau ( [ finalresult ] ) generated by the scalar baryon number transport mechanism is a factor of @xmath324 larger than that generated by charge transport involving stops .",
    "although the mass matrix used in ref .",
    "@xcite is not given by ( [ squarkmass ] ) , it seems plausible that when the scalar baryon number transport mechanism is efficient , namely for @xmath231 , @xmath307 , it yields the dominant stop contribution to the bau .",
    "huet and nelson also consider the contribution to the bau due to charge transport involving particles other than stops and find @xmath325 .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than ( [ finalresult ] ) , but only by a factor of @xmath326 if @xmath327 .",
    "note , however , that in some models@xcite @xmath74 is suppressed while @xmath73 is not . nevertheless ,",
    "a complete treatment of the bau should include the contribution due to charge transport involving particles other than stops .",
    "although perhaps not the whole story , scalar baryon number transport yields the dominant contribution to the bau due to stops , and can explain the cosmologically observed value .",
    "we have given our quantitative conclusions in the final four paragraphs of the previous section ; the present section is devoted to unresolved questions and to a discussion of possible implementations of the scalar baryon number transport mechanism .",
    "we have organized our presentation of the scalar baryon number transport mechanism in such a way that all the parts of the treatment requiring technical improvement were deferred to section iv , in which we restricted ourselves to making estimates .",
    "for example , further work is certainly called for in the calculation of the diffusion constant @xmath240 for semi - relativistic strongly interacting particles . in addition , our treatment of the suppression due to finite mean free paths can be improved .",
    "the reader can surely find other ways to improve the arguments of section iv . moving beyond the technical , we noted at the end of section iv that a more complete treatment should include the transport of charges other than baryon number carried by the scalars of interest .",
    "also , we have neglected thermal contributions to particle masses . since they are of order couplings times @xmath1 , and since the scalars we discuss have masses of order @xmath1 in the symmetric phase and somewhat higher in the broken phase , neglecting thermal masses seems reasonable in this exploratory treatment of the scalar baryon number transport mechanism , and we have left their inclusion to future work .    the crucial observation that makes the scalar baryon number transport mechanism possible is the existence of a broad enhanced reflection zone , a range of incident energies in which reflection coefficients and their cp violating asymmetries are large .",
    "this arises when there are a different number of propagating modes at a given energy on the two sides of the wall .",
    "a broad enhanced reflection zone may arise in contexts other than that which we have considered , for example with scalars that do not carry baryon number .",
    "this suggests that insights gained from this work may have wider application .",
    "as noted in the introduction , our main goal in this paper has been to present the scalar baryon number transport mechanism , not to address model building issues .",
    "we have chosen to work within a supersymmetric scenario . within this context",
    ", we now discuss some lessons for future model building efforts .",
    "it has already been realized@xcite that it is desirable for one stop to have a zero temperature mass less than the top mass , because this assists in making the electroweak phase transition more strongly first order .",
    "we now see that it is also advantageous to have symmetric phase masses that are of order @xmath328 , and that differ by 10 - 30%",
    ". it will be interesting to look for supersymmetric models satisfying this criterion . as noted in section",
    "ii , non - degeneracy of the appropriate magnitude arises in some models@xcite due to renormalization group running down from a high energy scale at which the stops are degenerate .",
    "we have called our mechanism scalar baryon number transport rather than stop baryon number transport deliberately",
    ". the essential features of our mechanism can be implemented in other extensions of the standard model involving baryon number carrying scalars , although such extensions are perhaps not as well motivated as the supersymmetric scenario .",
    "the recent hera anomaly@xcite may hint at the existence of first generation scalar leptoquarks of zero temperature mass @xmath329 .",
    "( see , for example , the treatment of babu",
    "_ et al._@xcite . )",
    "a scalar leptoquark is a particle with a yukawa coupling to a quark and a lepton , which therefore carries both lepton and baryon number .",
    "suppose that there are 3 generations of leptoquarks diagonally coupled to the 3 generations of quarks and leptons by their yukawa couplings . in a model with two higgs",
    "doublets @xmath13 and @xmath14 , couplings of the form @xmath330 , where @xmath331 and @xmath332 , can contribute to the masses of the leptoquarks in the broken phase and provide cp violating mixing .",
    "if the leptoquark masses receive other contributions that are nonzero in the symmetric phase , then a mass matrix of the required form can arise .",
    "( in fact , if contributions beyond tree - level are included , cp violating mixing terms can arise even in a theory with a single higgs field . )",
    "the simplest possibility , namely mixing between first and second generation leptoquarks , is tightly constrained by bounds arising from the non - observation of flavor changing neutral currents@xcite , and probably can not yield large enough off - diagonal terms in the mass matrix to be of interest . however",
    ", such bounds are absent or much weaker for @xmath333 or @xmath334 mixing .",
    "implementing the scalar baryon number transport mechanism using leptoquarks is therefore possible .",
    "it requires symmetric phase masses of @xmath7 , but since the zero temperature masses receive additional contributions proportional to the higgs vacuum expectation values , these can still be @xmath329 or higher .",
    "it is possible to construct leptoquark theories that are consistent with experiment in which the scalar baryon number transport mechanism generates a bau consistent with observation .",
    "we postpone further investigation , in particular attempts at using the bau to constrain parameters of such theories , until such a time as the experimental evidence becomes more compelling .",
    "let us hope nature is such that the stop ( or leptoquark ) spectrum is soon within reach of experiment , enabling us to discover whether the mass matrix is such that the observed cosmological baryon asymmetry can be due to scalar baryon number transport .",
    "the mechanism is efficient if there are two scalars with symmetric phase masses of order @xmath1 that differ by 10 - 30% , and if the bubble walls during the electroweak phase transition are sufficiently slow and sufficiently thin , as we have discussed in our conclusions presented in the previous section . under such circumstances , the baryon number flux produced by reflection of scalars with incident energies in the enhanced reflection zone",
    "can easily lead to a baryon asymmetry of the universe consistent with cosmological observation .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank john preskill and mark wise for many helpful suggestions .",
    "we thank martin gremm for his careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "we have had useful discussions with greg anderson , sergey cherkis , edward farhi , patrick huet , anton kapustin , zoltan ligeti , arthur lue , lisa randall , dam son , iain stewart and mark trodden .",

    "in this appendix , we describe a method for numerically evaluating the reflection coefficients used in section ii .",
    "we want to find solutions to the time - independent two field klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) .",
    "solutions to these second order linear ordinary differential equations are uniquely determined by specifying four boundary conditions on the fields and/or their first derivatives . along with the linearity of the differential equations",
    ", this implies that the solutions form a linear vector space of complex dimension four .    as discussed in section ii , because particles incident from the broken phase do not yield significant asymmetries , we need only consider the problem of calculating the reflection coefficients for @xmath10 s incident from the symmetric phase . in order to calculate @xmath16 , for instance",
    ", we must find a solution that satisfies the following conditions : at large negative @xmath43 in the symmetric phase , @xmath5 has a right - moving ( _ i.e. _ incident ) component with unit amplitude and @xmath6 has no right - moving component .",
    "there is no restriction on the left - moving plane waves in the symmetric phase  their amplitudes determine the reflection coefficients . in the enhanced reflection zone ,",
    "the solutions in the broken phase have one propagating mode , which must be purely right - moving , and one non - propagating mode , which must decay ( rather than grow ) exponentially for @xmath335 .    in the relevant solutions , the propagating modes in the broken phase must be purely right - moving ( _ i.e. _ outgoing ) , and the non - propagating modes must be exponentially decaying .",
    "these two broken phase boundary conditions , one for each mode , restrict the space of relevant solutions to a two - dimensional subspace of the complete four - dimensional solution space . in the basis of interest to us , the two solutions spanning this subspace correspond to an incident symmetric phase @xmath5 with no incident @xmath6 and to an incident symmetric phase @xmath6 with no incident @xmath5 . to find these basis solutions",
    "directly requires imposing boundary conditions in the symmetric phase . imposing two boundary conditions at large positive @xmath43 and two at large",
    "negative @xmath43 yields a more time consuming numerical task than imposing four boundary conditions at one point .",
    "instead , we proceed as follows .",
    "we first find two linearly independent solutions satisfying the broken phase boundary conditions , but not the symmetric phase boundary conditions .",
    "we find each solution by imposing four boundary conditions at one point in the broken phase and using the runge - kutta algorithm built into _",
    "these two solutions form a basis for the subspace of solutions satisfying the broken phase boundary conditions , and we find the basis of interest , namely the solutions satisfying the symmetric phase boundary conditions , by taking linear combinations .",
    "the boundary conditions described above should in general be imposed at spatial infinity .",
    "we find solutions satisfying boundary conditions at finite @xmath336 in the broken phase and at finite @xmath337 in the symmetric phase . because we have chosen our our profile function @xmath55 of ( [ profile ] ) such that the mass matrix does not vary for @xmath45 and for @xmath338 , we can set @xmath339 and @xmath340 without loss of accuracy . for a different profile function ,",
    "for instance one with exponential tails , one would have to choose @xmath337 and @xmath336 far enough out on the tails to achieve the desired accuracy .    in section iv",
    ", we discuss a method for obtaining a crude estimate of the effects of a finite mean free path . instead of imposing boundary conditions at @xmath341 ( equivalently for our profile function , @xmath340 )",
    ", we impose them at @xmath342 . here , @xmath116 is the point where one mode is totally reflected and is found by setting one of the eigenvalues of the mass - squared matrix equal to @xmath27 and @xmath93 is the mean free path . in order to implement this calculation , in the formalism",
    "we present below we keep @xmath337 a free parameter .",
    "we begin by finding two solutions , @xmath343 and @xmath344 , by matching at @xmath336 to the following right - moving solutions : @xmath345 where @xmath346 and @xmath347 are the momenta of the normal modes in the broken phase at @xmath348 ; @xmath115 and @xmath140 are the masses of these normal modes , defined as the square roots of the eigenvalues of the mass - squared matrix in the broken phase ; and @xmath349 and @xmath350 , the eigenvectors of the broken phase mass - squared matrix , define the broken phase normal modes in the symmetric phase @xmath351 basis .",
    "if a mode has real momentum , ( [ asymptoticsol ] ) ensures that it is right moving , since the time dependence of all modes is @xmath96 .",
    "if a mode is non - propagating , as one mode is in the enhanced reflection zone , its momentum should be taken to be negative imaginary to give a decaying exponential and not a growing one .",
    "matching to the asymptotic solutions ( [ asymptoticsol ] ) is equivalent to imposing the boundary conditions @xmath352 at @xmath348 .",
    "solutions to the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) with these complete one - point boundary conditions are easily found .",
    "the solutions that satisfy the symmetric phase boundary conditions are linear combinations of solution@xmath353 and solution@xmath354 .",
    "note that if @xmath53 is too large , we will run into difficulty in the enhanced reflection zone .",
    "we impose boundary conditions at @xmath336 , and find solution@xmath353 and solution@xmath354 by evolving toward smaller @xmath43 .",
    "these solutions include one mode that grows exponentially as @xmath43 is reduced , until @xmath43 reaches @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath355 is too large , the task of finding the solutions that satisfy the symmetric phase boundary conditions involves small differences between exponentially large quantities .",
    "we have found that going beyond @xmath356 requires about 30-digit working precision , and is therefore prohibitive .    in order to obtain the desired linear combinations of solution@xmath357 and solution@xmath354 ,",
    "it is necessary to know the amplitudes of the incident and reflected components of both @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the symmetric phase for both solution@xmath353 and solution@xmath354 . at the point @xmath337 in the symmetric phase ,",
    "we denote the eigenvectors of the mass - squared matrix defining the modes @xmath5 and @xmath6 by @xmath358 and @xmath359 ( orthogonal because @xmath8 is hermitian ) , the masses ( square roots of the corresponding eigenvalues ) by @xmath360 and @xmath114 , and the corresponding momenta by @xmath361 and @xmath362 .",
    "then the solutions at @xmath337 will be of the form @xmath363 where the @xmath155 s and @xmath364 s vary only slowly with @xmath43 near @xmath337 provided the mass matrix does not change much on length scales comparable to the wavelengths of the modes there .",
    "this condition is identically satisfied for @xmath365 , and is very well satisfied at larger values of @xmath337 for a wall width @xmath147 .",
    "we now write the amplitudes in ( [ a1a2b1b2 ] ) in terms of @xmath366 and its first derivative at @xmath367 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath368 of the incident component of mode @xmath369 in solution@xmath353 is given by @xmath370 the amplitude @xmath371 of the reflected component of mode @xmath369 in solution@xmath353 is given by @xmath372 the expressions for solution@xmath354 are analogous .    the solutions that have incident modes in the symmetric phase that are either purely @xmath5 or purely @xmath6 can now be constructed from the amplitudes @xmath368 , @xmath373 , @xmath371 and @xmath374 . the solution with incident @xmath5 and no incident @xmath6 is the linear combination of solution@xmath353 and solution@xmath354 for which the @xmath375 terms cancel , namely @xmath376 solution@xmath377 can be written in the form ( [ a1a2b1b2 ] ) , with coefficients @xmath378 these coefficients are the amplitudes of the incident and reflected modes in solution@xmath377 .",
    "similarly , the solution with incident @xmath6 and no incident @xmath5 is @xmath379 with amplitudes @xmath380 we now have all the ingredients necessary to construct the reflection coefficients @xmath104 .",
