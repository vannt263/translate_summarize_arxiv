    "n}.    i would like to describe the center of a clifford graph algebra .",
    "often , understanding the center of a ring is a first step towards understanding its structure and the structre of its representations . in case of clifford graph algebras the dimension of the center uniquely determines the structure of the given clifford algebra as proven in theorem [ ccca ] .",
    "i will denote the center of algebra @xmath0 by @xmath39 .",
    "suppose an element @xmath40 is in the center , where @xmath38 are monomials . as each monomial either commutes or anticommutes with the basis elements @xmath23 , every monomial @xmath38 lies in the center .",
    "hence , to analyze the center it is enough to analyze central monomials .",
    "a monomial @xmath38 is central iff for each vertex @xmath5 , the number of edges connecting it to the set of vertices @xmath12 is even .",
    "let me describe monomials in the center in terms of the adjacency matrix .",
    "let me remind you that the adjacency matrix of a graph @xmath29 is the matrix @xmath41 such that @xmath42 if the vertices @xmath5 and @xmath43 are connected and @xmath44 if they are not connected .",
    "a central monomial @xmath38 corresponds to a subset of vertices @xmath12 .",
    "if we add up rows of the adjacency matrix corresponding to this subset , the resulting row vector will have only even entries .",
    "that is , this vector is the zero vector modulo 2 .    the elements of the center form a subalgebra , and the dimension of the center is always a power of 2 .",
    "let us consider path graphs and star graphs as examples .",
    "not only providing examples can help my readers to understand my construction , but i also have other reasons for providing these particular examples , which i will reveal at the end of this section .",
    "let us start with a path graph @xmath45 on @xmath2 vertices .",
    "vertices @xmath5 and @xmath43 are connected by an edge iff @xmath46 ( see figure [ path6 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath2 is even , the center of the corresponding clifford graph algebra @xmath47 is one - dimensional : @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath2 is odd , then the center also contains the monomial @xmath49  the product of odd - numbered generators . in figure [ path7 ]",
    "you can see a path graph with 7 vertices .",
    "the monomial @xmath50 is in the center of this clifford graph algebra .",
    "let us compare the clifford algebras of the complete graph and the path graph with @xmath2 vertices .",
    "if we denote the generators of the clifford algebra of the complete graph as @xmath23 and the generators of the clifford algebra of the path graph as @xmath51 , we can show that the clifford algebras of these two graphs are isomorphic by presenting an isomorphism : @xmath52 and the other way : @xmath53    let us consider the star graph on @xmath2 vertices ( see figure [ star8 ] ) .        in this case",
    ", the vertex number 1 connects to every other vertex , and there are no other edges .",
    "the center is a linear combination of monomials of even length such that they do not contain @xmath31 .",
    "the dimension of the center is @xmath54 .",
    "let us show that the clifford algebra of the star graph is isomorphic to the clifford algebra of a graph with @xmath2 vertices and one edge .",
    "we denote the generators of the clifford algebra of the star graph as @xmath23 and the generators of the clifford algebra of the graph with @xmath2 vertices and one edge as @xmath51 , where we number the vertices adjacent to the edge as 1 and 2 , so that @xmath55 , and all other pairs of generators commute .",
    "we can show that the clifford algebras of these two graphs are isomorphic by presenting an isomorphism : @xmath56 and the other way : @xmath57    now it is time to explain why i particularly like these two examples .",
    "the path graph and the star graph with @xmath2 vertices are quite similar : they have the same number of edges  @xmath58 , not to mention that for @xmath2 equal 2 or 3 the path and the star graphs are isomorphic .",
    "on the other hand , the clifford algebra of a path graph has the smallest possible center ( we will see the proof later ) and the clifford algebra of a star graph has largest center for a non - commutative clifford graph algebra of this size .",
    "every central monomial in a clifford graph algebra corresponds to a central idempotent .",
    "suppose @xmath38 is a central monomial .",
    "then , @xmath59 . let us denote by @xmath60 a multiple of @xmath38 such that @xmath61 . if @xmath62 , then @xmath63 and if @xmath64 then @xmath65 . the element @xmath66 is a central idempotent .",
    "being a central idempotent means that @xmath24 is in the center and @xmath67 , which is easy to check .",
    "central idempotent @xmath24 gives rise to a decomposition of our clifford graph algebra @xmath0 as a direct sum of @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( see idempotence article at wiki @xcite ) .",
    "let us take an index @xmath43 that belongs to the set @xmath12 , that is , @xmath70 is one of the generators that the monomial @xmath38 contains .",
    "denote the graph @xmath29 with the vertex corresponding to @xmath43 removed by @xmath71 .",
    "the algebra @xmath72 is naturally embedded into @xmath30 .",
    "the map @xmath73 is an isomorphism between this embedding of @xmath72 and @xmath68 .",

    "we can continue the decomposition until we get a graph such that its clifford algebra has a one - dimensional center .",
    "if the dimension of the center of @xmath30 is @xmath75 , then @xmath30 is a direct sum of @xmath75 copies of the clifford graph algebra of a subgraph @xmath76 of @xmath29 , such that @xmath77 has a one - dimensional center .    by the artin - wedderburn theorem",
    "@xcite we can show that a clifford graph algebra is isomorphic to a direct sum of matrix algebras .",
    "therefore , any clifford graph algebra is a direct sum of @xmath75 copies of an @xmath78 matrix algebra , for some @xmath79 .",
    "we can deduce from here that @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , we see that for graphs with odd number of vertices , the corresponding clifford graph algebra has to have a center of dimension more than 1 .    in our examples",
    ", we saw that the clifford graph algebra of a complete graph is isomorphic to a clifford algebra of a path graph . for @xmath2 even , both of these algebras are isomorphic to a matrix algebra over the @xmath81-dimensional space . for odd @xmath2 ,",
    "the clifford algebra of the complete graph is a direct sum of two clifford graph algebras of the complete graph for @xmath58 .",
    "the same goes for the path graph .",
    "the clifford algebra corresponding to a star graph is the direct sum of @xmath54 copies of a @xmath82 matrix algebra .",
    "previously we covered complete graphs , path graphs and star graphs in our examples .",
    "now i would like to cover all graphs with small number of vertices and see how their clifford graph algebras are different from each other .",

    "@xmath86 .    for @xmath87",
    ", there are two graphs  a complete graph whose clifford algebra is a @xmath82 matrix algebra @xmath88 and the dual graph without edges whose clifford algebra is @xmath89 .",
    "thus , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    for @xmath92 , there are four graphs .",
    "the clifford algebra of a graph with no edges is commutative , thus it has an 8-dimensional center and is equal to the direct sum of 8 copies of @xmath1 .",
    "all other graphs ( see figure [ threegraphs ] ) have a two - dimensional center , hence they are isomorphic to @xmath93 .",
    "thus , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "for @xmath96 , there are 11 graphs .",
    "below i describe all the graphs with 4 vertices and present the dimension of the center of the corresponding clifford algebra .    1 .",
    "there is one graph without edges  the dimension is 16",
    "there is one graph with one edge  the dimension is 4 . 3 .",
    "there are two graphs with two edges : the graph with two adjacent edges  the dimension is 4 ; the graph with 2 non - adjacent edges  the dimension is 1 .",
    "there are 3 graphs with 3 edges : the complete graph with 3 vertices plus 1 isolated vertex  the dimension is 4 ; the path graph  the dimension is 1 ; the star graph  the dimension is 4 . 5 .",

    "[ ccca ] if two graphs are in the same clifford class then their clifford algebras are isomorphic .",

    "the generators @xmath51 commute with both @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath110 .",
    "this means that vertices numbered 1 and 2 in the graph @xmath76 are isolated from the rest of the graph @xmath76 . from here",

    "we already proved this fact in section [ cgas ] using the artin - wedderburn theorem . here",
    "we prove it again without using this theorem . from theorem [ clcl ] ,",
    "all clifford algebras with one - dimensional center and the same number of vertices are isomorphic to each other .",
    "that means that the clifford algebra of the graph @xmath122 , sometimes called the ladder rung graph , is isomorphic to the clifford graph algebra of the complete graph @xmath123 , which is the matrix algebra @xmath124 .",
    "hence the clifford algebra of @xmath102 , as well as all other algebras of the same class , is isomorphic to a direct sum of @xmath106 copies of @xmath124 .",
    "the adjacency matrix of a graph @xmath29 is a matrix @xmath41 such that @xmath42 if the vertices @xmath5 and @xmath43 are connected and @xmath44 if they are not connected . by definition ,",
    "the adjacency matrix is symmetric : @xmath125 ; and by requiring our graphs not to have loops we restrict the diagonal to have only zeroes : @xmath126 .    in the proof of lemma [ constr ] we used a construction where we express old generators through new generators .",
    "we can express our replacement through a sequence of basic replacements .",
    "the basic replacement is the following .",
    "the new generators are @xmath111 for @xmath127 and @xmath128 . the coefficient @xmath129 is needed to adjust the square of @xmath118 to be equal to @xmath130 . the new adjacency matrix @xmath131 can be calculated from the old adjacency matrix by the following operation : replace the second row in the adjacency matrix by the sum of the first row and the second row modulo 2 , then do the same operation on the columns .",
    "in particular , we see that the basic operation does nt change the rank or the determinant of the adjacency matrix if we consider this matrix to be a matrix over field @xmath132 .",
    "in particular , the basic operation does nt change the parity of the determinant .",
    "two graphs belong to the same clifford class iff their adjacency matrices considered as matrices over @xmath132 have the same rank .",
    "i previously produced a construction that changes a graph but does nt change its clifford class .",
    "i just showed that this construction does nt change the rank of the adjacency matrix over @xmath132 .",

    "the adjacency matrix of a clifford algebra of the graph @xmath102 has rank @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the rank separates the classes .",

    "let us call a graph an odd - determinant graph if its clifford graph algebra has a one - dimensional center .",
    "the odd - determinant graphs are the graphs whose adjacency matrix has an odd determinant .    by the discussion above , the parity of the determinant of the adjacency matrix is invariant under basic construction , and by using the basic construction we can replace a given graph @xmath29 with a canonical graph @xmath134 such that their clifford algebras are isomorphic .",
    "obviously , an odd - determinant graph does nt have isolated vertices .",
    "also , all odd - determinant graphs are in the same clifford class .",
    "no graphs in the clifford class of an odd - determinant graph have isolated vertices . and vice versa , if no graphs in the clifford class of a graph have isolated vertices then all the graphs in this class are odd - determinant graphs .    from the classification theorem it follows that an odd - determinant graph has a complete graph on even number of vertices in its class .",
    "in the next two sections i discuss other sets of graphs that are related to odd - determinant graphs .",
    "by definition , a mating graph , sometimes called a point - determining graph ( see @xcite ) , is a graph such that no two vertices have identical sets of neighbors .",

    "the converse of the lemma is not true .",

    ". graphs with an odd number of vertices ca nt be odd - determinant . at the same time",
    "there are 2 mating graphs with 3 vertices : @xmath136 , and the union of @xmath103 and an isolated point ( see figure [ matinggraphs3 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that complete graphs are always mating graphs .",
    "the set of neighbors of each vertex is uniquely determined by the vertex itself : the neighbors of the vertex are the set of all the other vertices .",
    "that means the complete graphs with an odd number of vertices give an infinite set of examples of mating and not odd - determinant graphs .",
    "similarly , the union of a complete graph with an isolated point is a mating graph .",
    "below i present all mating graphs with 4 vertices .",
    "only one of them is not an odd - determinant graph  the union of the complete graph @xmath136 and an isolated vertex .",
    "we see that if we want to estimate the number of odd - determinant graphs we have a natural bound : the number of such graphs is not more than the number of mating graphs .",
    "there is a natural set of graphs that is somewhat in between odd - determinant graphs and mating graphs .",
    "this is the set of graphs with invertible adjacency matrices .",

    "odd - determinant graphs are a subset of them . on the other hand",
    "a non - mating graph has two equal rows in its adjacency matrix , thus the determinant of its adjacency matrix is zero .",
    "thus , graphs with an invertible adjacency matrix give us a better bound on the number of odd - determinant graphs than mating graphs .    the smallest graph with an invertible adjacency matrix that has an even determinant is @xmath136 .",

    "let us find an example of a graph with an even number of vertices and an invertible adjacency matrix which is not an odd - determinant graph .",
    "we can see that there are no such graphs with 2 or 4 vertices .",
    "hence , we should try six vertices .",
    "there are 10 such graphs with 6 vertices and you can see them in figure [ invertibleeven6 ] . not surprisingly , the union of two copies of @xmath136 is in this set .        to complete our discussion",
    "i would like to show mating graphs with a degenerate adjacency matrix .",
    "the smallest such graph has one vertex .",
    "the smallest nontrivial case is a graph with 3 vertices and it is the union of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "i already mentioned the unions of graphs , but this whole section is dedicated to the unions of graphs , so i would like to remind you of the formal definition .",

    "let us see how mating graphs behave with respect to unions .",

    "unions of complete graphs as long as they do not contain more than one isolated vertex are mating graphs .",
    "the determinants of adjacency matrices behave nicely with respect to unions . if graph @xmath29 is the union of @xmath137 and @xmath138 , then the determinant of the adjacency matrix of @xmath29 is the product of the corresponding determinants for @xmath137 and @xmath138 . from here",
    "the next lemma follows :    if @xmath137 and @xmath138 are two graphs with invertible adjacency matrices , then their union @xmath29 has an invertible adjacency matrix .",
    "if the union @xmath29 of two graph @xmath137 and @xmath138 has an invertible adjacency matrix , then the graphs @xmath137 and @xmath138 themselves have invertible adjacency matrices .",

    "suppose a monomial @xmath25 is in the center of the clifford algebra @xmath30 .",
    "then we can express it as a product of two monomials @xmath145 and @xmath146 , where @xmath147 contains only the generators corresponding to the first ( or second ) graph .",
    "it is easy to see that monomials @xmath148 must belong to the center of the clifford graph algebra @xmath149 .",
    "the converse is also true :    if @xmath29 is an odd - determinant graph and is the union of several connected components , then each component is an odd - determinant graph too .",
    "if a clifford algebra corresponding to a connected component has a center , then the corresponding monomial is in the center of the clifford algebra of the whole graph .",
    "the previous lemmas allow us to build many mating graphs that are not odd - determinant graphs .",
