    "using conventional theory the natural lineshapes predicted with the minimal coupling and multipolar hamiltonians are different .",
    "this problem was investigated in detail by power and zienau , who found that the predictions of the multipolar hamiltonian were in better agreement with the experiment of lamb @xcite .",
    "it is now well understood that these formally different hamiltonians correspond to different choices of gauge @xcite .",
    "one must conclude that the dependence of the lineshape on the form of the hamiltonian is a type of gauge dependence .",
    "it has been shown that both the minimal coupling and multipolar formulations are particular instances of a more general framework in which the gauge freedom is carried by the arbitrary transverse component of the the green s function satisfying @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "ubiquitously in practical calculations throughout qed one starts by partitioning an atom - field hamiltonian into free and interacting parts based on its superficial appearance as a function of the canonical operators .",
    "the gauge dependence of the canonical momenta gives rise to a concurrent gauge dependence of the atom , field and interaction components of the hamiltonian , as well as the bare atom - photon states and ultimately the lineshape prediction @xcite .",
    "this notwithstanding , if one _ defines _ the lineshape observable in terms of the bare states and canonical momenta of a specific gauge @xmath1 , the same result can be found in a gauge @xmath6 by identifying the same physical observables and states as were used in @xmath1 .",
    "for example , if in the coulomb gauge we had a state @xmath7 and an observable represented by @xmath8 , the same physical state and observable in the gauge-@xmath1 , are represented by @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively . with this understood , one can see that a definition of the lineshape in terms of some set of _ physical _ observables and states is an implicitly _ gauge invariant _ definition .",
    "the task at hand is that of determining the representation in which the canonical operators and bare states happen to represent the physical observables and states that give rise to the correct definition .",
    "such a determination may be possible by comparison of the theoretical predictions with experiment .",
    "this in turn would allow one to determine when starting with a canonical partitioning of the hamiltonian , which representation gives the best description of atom - radiation interactions .",
