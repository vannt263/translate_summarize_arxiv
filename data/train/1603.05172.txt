    "large flakes of mose@xmath0 mono- and multi - layers have been produced by mechanical exfoliation of bulk mose@xmath0 .",
    "flakes were then deposited on a si / sio@xmath0 substrate with @xmath24  nm of sio@xmath0 .",
    "the substrate had been patterned with circular holes of @xmath45  @xmath86 diameter , but all the results presented in the main text have been obtained on supported regions . the following photograph in fig .  [ samples ] present the different specimens that were used for the reported measurements .        as stated in the main text , mose@xmath0",
    "mono - layers can be identified by ( i ) a single component a@xmath10 feature at @xmath87  @xmath8 while this feature is observed at @xmath88  @xmath8 for 2l and is a multi - component feature for @xmath61 , ( ii ) the non - observation of the two e/e@xmath60 and a@xmath4/a@xmath60 modes at @xmath57 and @xmath58  @xmath8 , respectively , and ( iii ) by the observation of an energy separation bigger than @xmath89  @xmath8 between the a@xmath10 and the feature close to @xmath46  @xmath8 ( see fig .  [ dif ] .",
    "these ar the three raman scattering signatures of 1l - mose@xmath0 that emerge from this study .     upper panel : raman scattering spectra for 1l to 8l - mose@xmath0 samples .",
    "lower panel : energy difference between the @xmath46  @xmath8 feature and the a@xmath10/a@xmath60 feature .",
    "the energy separation between these modes is maximum in the case of the monolayer and then decreases for thicker samples .",

    "the normalization of raman scattering intensities is crucial for the study of resonance effects .",
    "all intensities presented in the main text are normalized according to the following procedure : we first make a background correction .",
    "this background is most of the case flat but , when the excitation wavelength is set close to the low energy excitons of mono or few layer mose@xmath0 , luminescence signals affect the spectra and are removed but using standard computer tools .",
    "spectra are then normalized by the integrated silicon signal at @xmath91  @xmath8 .",
    "the silicon first order raman scattering peak shows a resonance when using high excitation energies .",
    "this effect was studied in detail in ref .  [ ] and has to be taken into account by normalizing the measured signal by the resonance curve of silicon ( which also includes the wavelength dependance of the raman scattering process ) . finally , the flake is on top of a sio@xmath0/si structure which produces optical interferences which have a strong impact on the measured raman intensities . as it is shown in the literature  @xcite , the raman intensities of the si and the mose@xmath0 layers are proportional to an _ enhancement factor _ due to the optical interference existent in a multi - layered structure given by : @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the electrical field s amplitude of the total incident and scattered light respectively , and @xmath95 is the thickness of the mose@xmath0 .",
    "the enhancement factor for the si substrate is  @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the electrical field amplitude of the total incident and scattered light respectively .",
    "it is important to take into account the wavelength dependence of the complex refractive index of each materials to describe the propagation of the incident and of the scattered light . in the experiment ,",
    "the incident wavelength is given by the exciting laser and the raman process defines the scattered wavelength . to correct the data , we multiply the experimental spectra by the ratio @xmath99  @xcite after performing the silicon signal normalization described above .    ) as a function of wavelength for a semi - infinite integration and the @xmath100 correction . when the penetration depth is smaller than @xmath100 , ( 400 - 550 nm ) the @xmath101 factor is approximately the same for both calculations .",
    "b ) ratio @xmath99 for 1l - mose@xmath0 and for bulk mose@xmath0.[pedro ] ]    expression is calculated considering an `` unidimensional '' problem , where the si substrate is treated as a half - infinite media . in the ir region , where the si absorption is small , when using a microscope objective with a large numerical aperture , we should take the divergence effect of the focused gaussian beam into account and calculate the integral in a probed volume defined by the depth of focus .",
    "the depth of focus @xmath102 is defined as the distance between the points at each side of the beam - waist where the irradiance of the beam falls to one - half of its value  @xcite . according to ref .",
    "[ ] it is given by      where @xmath104 is the beam radius at the waist ( spot size in the focus ) and @xmath105 is the wavelength within the material . taking that into account , the upper integral limit(@xmath106 )",
    "must be modified to @xmath107 .    for 1l - mose@xmath0 sample ,",
    "[ pedro]a shows the comparison between the semi - infinite integration and the @xmath100 correction for the si raman intensity both as a function of wavelength .",
    "here we assumed a raman shift of 520@xmath8 .",
    "the complex refractive index for si and sio@xmath0 as a function of the wavelength were taken from ref .",
    "[ ] and ref .",
    "[ ] respectively and the refractive index of 1l - mose@xmath0 was taken from ref .",
    "[ pedro]b shows the ratio of the si and the mose@xmath0 enhancement factor as a function of the wavelength for a 1l - mose@xmath0 and bulk mose@xmath0 assuming a raman shift of 290@xmath8 . the bulk mose@xmath0 refractive index was taken from ref .",
    "[ ] . as can be seen , the enhancement factor for 1l - mose@xmath0 and bulk mose@xmath0 are similar so that we used the refractive index of the 1l - mose@xmath0 for the calculations in the multi - layer samples .",

    "<S> using resonant raman scattering spectroscopy with 25 different laser lines , we describe the raman scattering spectra of mono- and multi - layers 2h - molybdenum diselenide ( mose@xmath0 ) as well as the different resonances affecting the most pronounced features . for high - energy phonons , both a- and e- symmetry type phonons present resonances with a and b excitons of mose@xmath0 together with a marked increase of intensity when exciting at higher energy , close to the c exciton energy . </S>",
    "<S> we observe symmetry dependent exciton - phonon coupling affecting mainly the low - energy rigid layer phonon modes . </S>",
    "<S> the shear mode for multilayer displays a pronounced resonance with the c exciton while the breathing mode has an intensity that grows with the excitation laser energy , indicating a resonance with electronic excitations at energies higher than that of the c exciton .    </S>",

    "<S> this family of materials includes semiconducting compounds ( mx@xmath0 with m = mo or w and x= s , se , or te ) . </S>",
    "<S> they offer an interesting platform to explore purely two - dimensional excitons , phonons , and to study the interplay between the spin and valley physics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> monolayers of these materials can be transferred on adapted substrates for optical or transport investigations . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to gapless graphene , their band gap of @xmath1  ev allows for the construction of transistors  @xcite and of photodetectors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even though the room temperature electronic mobilities they exhibit reach only the level of few hundreds @xmath2 , orders of magnitude below what is achieved in conventional iii - v or ii - vi semiconductors quantum wells , their flexibility and transparency are extremely appealing for future electronic and optoelectronic applications . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , they are used as building blocks of van der waals heterostructures  @xcite , which can not be controlled without a deep knowledge of the phonon modes and of the electron - phonon interaction in the individual layers . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth to point out that the photoluminescence ( pl ) of mx@xmath0 monolayers arises from tightly bound excitons  @xcite , with binding energies close to @xmath3  mev , and hence comparable to those usually observed in molecules or in carbon nanotubes  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> raman scattering plays an important role in the rapid development of the field of research of 2d crystals as it provides , for most layered materials , a fast and non - invasive tool to determine the number of layers of a given specimen  @xcite : when the thickness of a mx@xmath0 flake is reduced , the energy of some optical phonons changes in a way that can be traced using standard techniques . </S>",
    "<S> resonant raman scattering is powerful technique to explore electronic properties of materials . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant enhancement of raman scattering signals when the laser energy is tuned to particular values corresponding to electronic excitations of the investigated system , is a well established tool to perform , for instance , the spectroscopy of weakly radiative excitations . </S>",

    "<S> the phonon mode of e symmetry around @xmath7  @xmath8 , measured at @xmath9  nm , has a much weaker intensity than the a@xmath10 mode  @xcite close to @xmath11  @xmath8 . the e mode is split over the whole phonon brillouin zone , with a splitting of @xmath12  @xmath8 at the @xmath6 point . </S>",
    "<S> these two e phonons are of longitudinal ( lo ) and of transverse character ( to ) , and their splitting comes from the polar character of mose@xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> resonant studies with a large number of laser lines spanning from the near infrared to the ultraviolet are seldom done , and this is particularly difficult and absent in the literature when low energy excitations are involved . </S>",
    "<S> it is such a systematic and comprehensive study that is being reported here , for a model mx@xmath0 material ( mose@xmath0 ) from monolayer to multi - layer structures . </S>",
    "<S> we present a resonant raman scattering investigation of mono- and multilayer 2h - mose@xmath0 using @xmath13 different laser excitation lines from @xmath14  nm ( @xmath15  ev ) to @xmath16  nm ( @xmath17  ev ) , which span the energies of the three different excitons a , b and c , located close to @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20  ev , respectively  @xcite , and including both high and low energy vibrations . in the first part , we focus on monolayer mose@xmath4 ( 1l - mose@xmath0 ) , discussing in particular the identification of the main raman scattering features and their excitation profiles . </S>",
