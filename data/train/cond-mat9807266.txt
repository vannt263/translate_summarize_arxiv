    "the magnetization process ( @xmath0 curve , @xmath22 : magnetization , @xmath1 : magnetic field ) of one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum spin system has recently drawn much attention , due to the remarkable progress in material synthesis techniques and high - field experiments .",
    "@xcite spin chains with various @xmath11 ( spin magnitude ) and/or with non - trivial special structures , etc , exhibit various interesting magnetic behaviors ( e.g. , field - induced phase transitions , like plateau in the @xmath0 curve  @xcite ) , many of which still await theoretical analyses .    as for the @xmath0 curve of the gapful @xmath23 antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg chain ,",
    "it has been known that , on raising the magnetic field from zero , there is a critical field @xmath9 above which the system becomes magnetized .",
    "this critical field relates to the excitation gap ( haldane gap ) @xmath24 as @xmath25 ( , @xmath26 : @xmath26-factor , @xmath27 : bohr magneton ) .",
    "we call @xmath9 _ lower critical field _ because there also exists _ upper critical field",
    "_ @xmath8 ( saturation field ) above which the magnetization saturates to @xmath28 . near @xmath8",
    ", it is well established that the @xmath0 curve behaves as @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite near @xmath9 ,",
    "similar behavior @xmath30 with @xmath31 has also been known,@xcite but numerically , whether the exponent @xmath32 is _ exactly _ 1/2 or not , has remained to be less conclusive as compared with the behavior near @xmath8 .    the expected square - root behavior @xmath33 has been explained via approximate mapping to the @xmath7-function bose gas  @xcite or to the fermion gas .",
    "there is numerical evidence for such mappings ,  @xcite but , the square - root behavior of the _ bulk magnetization _ itself has not been fully verified yet . in the finite-@xmath34 ( @xmath34 : system size ) diagonalization study , @xcite the smallness of @xmath34 disables us to make quantitative discussion of the bulk magnetization near @xmath9 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a large - size system is treated by the density - matrix renormalization group@xcite ( dmrg , for short ) to study the low - lying excitations having small @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "it was shown there that the low - lying excitations admit fermionic interpretation , just as in the case of the bethe - ansatz solution of the @xmath7-function bose gas at low particle density .",
    "this result is indeed a strong support for the bose - gas picture , but the smallness of @xmath35 implies that , in a strict sense , the result applies only to the system in the vanishing magnetization density @xmath37 .",
    "further , there is a quantity which is undoubtedly important for the bose - gas picture , but has not been considered seriously so far : the effective bose - gas coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "let us consider a 1d ( effective ) @xmath7-function bose gas with the hamiltonian @xmath38 , \\label{tag-1}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 and @xmath40 being the bose operators . by solving the bethe ansatz integral equation",
    "we obtain the ground - state energy density @xmath41 as@xcite @xmath42 in terms of the particle density @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 with @xmath45 in the bose - gas picture , the @xmath0 curve of the spin chain near the critical field corresponds to the @xmath46 curve of the bose gas , where @xmath47 is the chemical potential .",
    "as far as the critical behavior is concerned , only the @xmath48-term is relevant , which determines both the critical exponent ( @xmath49 ) and the critical amplitude . since the coefficient @xmath50 does not depend on @xmath10 ,",
    "the critical behavior must be @xmath10-independent and `` universal '' . however , actual @xmath46 curve heavily dependents on the value of @xmath10 which comes from @xmath51 and/or higher - order terms .",
    "in fact , the coefficient @xmath52 of @xmath53-term ( @xmath54 ) is proportional to @xmath55 , which becomes dominant for small @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly , the critical region of the square - root behavior will become rather narrow for small @xmath10 .",
    "hence , knowledge of the actual value of the effective coupling constant @xmath10 is indispensable , in order to make a fully quantitative test of the bose - gas picture .",
    "the aim of the present article is to give a quantitative test for the bose - gas picture of the bilinear - biquadratic af chain in a field . for this purpose",
    ", we employ the quantum version  @xcite of the product - wavefunction renormalization group method@xcite ( pwfrg method , for short ) .",
    "the pwfrg is a variant of the s.r .",
    "white s dmrg ,  @xcite which is specially designed to obtain the `` fixed point '' ( = thermodynamic limit of the system  @xcite ) of the dmrg iterations efficiently . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the pwfrg which was originally implemented for 2d classical systems , can also be applied to 1d quantum systems by replacing the transfer - matrix multiplication with the modified lanczos operation .",
    "even with relatively small number of retained bases , which is conventionally denoted as `` @xmath56 '' , pwfrg calculations accurately reproduce exact @xmath0 curves for integrable models,@xcite which demonstrates both the efficiency and the reliability of the method .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model we consider is @xmath57   , \\quad { \\cal h}_{\\rm zeeman } = h\\sum_{i}s_{i}^{z } ,   \\label{tag-5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the @xmath23 spin operator at the site @xmath4 . for notational simplicity",
    ", we have took the units where @xmath59 , or , these factors are absorbed into the field @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we consider the case @xmath60 .",
    "we concentrate on the behavior of the @xmath0 curve near the two critical fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "let us consider first the system near the upper critical field ( saturation field ) @xmath61 , where the @xmath0 curve shows the square - root behavior : @xmath62 . as compared with the one near @xmath9 , this behavior itself is well - established ( by exact diagonalization  @xcite and bethe ansatz@xcite ) .",
    "our concern is how well the @xmath7-function bose gas can describe the @xmath0 curve _ away from _ the saturation field . for this purpose",
    ", we should derive the _",
    "correct _ effective bose gas hamiltonian , which we shall make by employing the low - energy effective @xmath11-matrix approach .    above the saturation field @xmath8 , the system is ferromagnetically ordered ( `` all - up '' state ) .",
    "low - energy excitations slightly below @xmath8 are well described in terms of `` down spins '' in the sea of up ( `` @xmath63 '' ) spins .",
    "regarding a down spin as a particle , we consider two - body scattering problem to obtain the exact two - body @xmath11-matrix .",
    "@xcite the point is that in the _ low - energy limit _",
    "the @xmath11-matrix reduces , in most cases , to that of the @xmath7-function bose gas with an effective coupling constant . with this",
    "_ correct _ coupling constant , the bose gas will give a quantitative description of the system near @xmath8 .",
    "by @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , we denote the @xmath66-diagonal bases of the spin chain . to solve the two - down - spin problem we express the eigenvector @xmath67 in terms of the wavefunctions @xmath68 and @xmath69 as @xmath70 the two - body @xmath11-matrix @xmath71 is introduced through the asymptotic ( @xmath72 ) behavior of the wavefunction : @xmath73 the eigenvalue problem @xmath74 is solved to give @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the one - particle ( one - down - spin ) energy . since the one - particle energy @xmath77 takes its minimum at @xmath78 , we put @xmath79 and consider the `` low energy limit '' @xmath80 . in this limit , the @xmath11-matrix",
    "whose explicit expression has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite , becomes @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the @xmath11-matrix of the @xmath7-function bose gas with hamiltonian @xmath83 in ( [ tag-1 ] ) .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath84 therefore , in discussing the low - energy properties near the saturation field , the bilinear - biquadratic chain ( [ tag-5 ] ) is equivalent to the bose - gas with the effective coupling constant @xmath85 a remark is in order . for @xmath86 or @xmath87 the coupling constant ( [ tag-13 ] ) takes negative value .",
    "it has been known that the @xmath7-function bose gas with negative coupling constant is unphysical , because the system is unstable against formation of multiparticle bound states . in the present case of finite-@xmath11 spin chain , however , @xmath34-particle bound state with large @xmath34 are kinematically forbidden because more than @xmath88 `` particles '' can not exist at a single site .",
    "further , in the @xmath89 case , the bound state actually exists ,  @xcite but , for @xmath90 it is a high - energy mode which can also be neglected , near the saturation field at least .",
    "hence , the effective bose gas with negative coupling constant , does have a meaning in the present case .    from the bose - gas energy density @xmath91 in ( [ tag-2 ] ) and ( [ tag-3 ] ) with @xmath92 and @xmath93",
    ", we obtain the @xmath0 curve through @xmath94 at arbitrary @xmath43 , we can numerically solve the bethe - ansatz integral equation  @xcite by converting it to a matrix equation , to obtain @xmath95 within any required precision . to check the validity of the bose - gas description of the @xmath0 curve , we performed the numerical - renormalization - group calculations .",
    "the method we employed is the quantum version  @xcite of the pwfrg ,  @xcite which allows us to make fixed-@xmath1 calculations sweeping the value of @xmath1 giving the @xmath0 curve @xmath96 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "fig.1 shows comparison between the bose - gas results and the pwfrg calculations , where we see excellent agreements for unexpectedly wide range of the field @xmath1 .",
    "the validity of the bose - gas picture in the quantitative description of the @xmath0 curve , is thus verified .",
    "our two - down - spin @xmath11-matrix approach is easily extended to general-@xmath11 bilinear - biquadratic chain with the hamiltonian @xmath97 . \\label{generals}\\ ] ] after a straightforward calculation very similar to the ones in refs.@xcite , we obtain the effective bose - gas coupling as @xmath98 for the pure bilinear case ( @xmath99 ) , we have @xmath100 in fig.2 we compare the pwfrg - calculated curves for @xmath101 to bose - gas curves with corresponding values of @xmath10 given by ( [ tag-15 ] ) .",
    "we again see satisfactory agreements .",
    "let us give a comment on previous studies related to the present one .",
    "for the spin-@xmath11 `` pure '' heisenberg af ( @xmath102 in ( [ generals ] ) ) , the bose - gas description near @xmath8 has already been made within the conventional spin - wave - theoretical approach.@xcite this approach gives the value of the bose - gas coupling constant to be @xmath103 which is different from ( [ tag-15 ] ) .",
    "the spin - wave value ( [ tag-15 - 0 ] ) deviates from ( [ tag-15 ] ) very much at small @xmath11 ( even the _ sign _ disagrees at @xmath104 ) , although both are the same in the large-@xmath11 limit . having seen that the bose - gas with ( [ tag-15 ] ) gives the correct @xmath0 curve , we must say that , at small @xmath11 , the spin - wave approach is not reliable enough for quantitative studies of the af chains , even in the neighborhood of the saturation field .",
    "note that , using the the dyson - maleev transformation and taking the continuum limit , we can formally rewrite@xcite the spin - chain hamiltonian ( [ generals ] ) with @xmath102 into the @xmath7-function bose - gas hamiltonian with ( [ tag-15 - 0 ] ) . although this transformation seems to be exact in the operator level , there is a constraint on the state space : the boson number can not exceed @xmath88 at each site",
    ". this constraint amounts to `` kinematical interaction '' between the spin waves , which may be the source of the disagreement between ( [ tag-15 ] ) and ( [ tag-15 - 0 ] ) .",
    "at @xmath105 the ground state is singlet and non - magnetic . on raising @xmath1 ,",
    "system still remains to be singlet upto a critical field @xmath9 above which the ground - state become magnetized .",
    "the field - induced phase transition at @xmath9 is a level - crossing transition between the singlet state and the lowest - energy triplet state ( both at @xmath105 ) , hence the critical field @xmath9 is , in our unit , just the excitation gap ( `` haldane gap '' ) @xmath24 .",
    "then , in the bose - gas description near @xmath9 , the singlet ground state should be interpreted as the `` vacuum '' , and the triplet state with @xmath106 the `` one - particle state '' .    for @xmath107 ,",
    "the `` one - particle '' energy dispersion @xmath108 takes its minimum at @xmath78 . the dispersion curve around this minimum",
    "is often assumed to be relativistic one,@xcite @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 is called spin - wave velocity . in the low - energy ( @xmath112 ) limit , ( [ tag-16 ] ) becomes @xmath113 unlike the case of @xmath114 , this `` one - particle state '' can not be treated exactly , because the `` vacuum '' itself is not known exactly due to the non - integrablity of the system ( except for some special values of @xmath12 ( @xmath115 ) ) .",
    "accordingly , for general @xmath116 , it is impossible to calculate the exact two - body @xmath11-matrix @xmath71 which is utilized in the previous section to determine the effective coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless , if we assume the bose - gas picture to be held , we can `` indirectly '' determine the value of @xmath10 from the @xmath0 curve obtained by the pwfrg . to see whether the obtained value of @xmath10 lies in a reasonable range or not , serves as a partial check of the validity of the bose - gas picture .",
    "near @xmath117 , we should relate the @xmath0 curve to the bose - gas energy density @xmath91 as @xmath118 then , for the square - root behavior @xmath119 we should expect the expansion of the form , @xmath120 where we have used ( [ tag-3 ] ) . since the expression ( [ tag-17 ] ) of the one - particle energy implies @xmath121 in ( [ tag-1 ] ) and ( [ tag-4 ] ) , we have @xmath122 from ( [ tag-2])-([tag-4 ] ) , it is clear that the width of critical region essentially depends on the reduced coupling constant @xmath123 defined by ( see ( [ tag-4 ] ) ) @xmath124 if we rewrite ( [ tag-20 ] ) as @xmath125 a condition for the square - root criticality is @xmath126 ( and also @xmath127 ) . by @xmath128 ,",
    "we denote width of the critical region in @xmath22 , which we conveniently define as @xmath129 then @xmath130 implies @xmath131 which may be regarded as a necessary condition for the criticality .",
    "correspondingly , we can introduce @xmath132 defined by @xmath133 which represents the width of the critical region in @xmath134 .",
    "let us now check the bose - gas prediction of the @xmath0 curve by comparing it with the pwfrg calculations . from the @xmath135 curve , we determine @xmath24 ( = @xmath9 ) , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath7 in ( [ tag-23 ] ) by the least - square fitting . in fig.3",
    "we show the pwfrg results of the @xmath135 curves near @xmath9 for @xmath138 .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath24 are @xmath139 ( for @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( for @xmath142 ) , both of which are in good agreement with the known values @xmath143 ( for the former  @xcite ) and @xmath141 ( for the latter  @xcite ) .    to verify the relation @xmath144 we need values of @xmath111 . for @xmath99 using the known value  @xcite @xmath145 we have @xmath146 which should be compared with @xmath147 obtained from the @xmath135 curve ;",
    "the obtained value of @xmath136 is in reasonable agreement with @xmath148 .",
    "for @xmath142 there seems to be no serious numerical evaluation of @xmath111 .",
    "we therefore consult ref.@xcite where a variational calculation of @xmath108 beyond the single - mode approximation  @xcite ( which gives @xmath149 ) is made ; we have @xmath150 this value is also in reasonable agreement with @xmath151 obtained from the @xmath135 curve .",
    "hence , the @xmath135 curves reproduce the `` one - particle quantities '' in the bose - gas picture . further , the coefficients @xmath137 and @xmath7 are estimated to be @xmath152 since the negative values of @xmath137 implies the positive effective bose - coupling constant , our pwfrg calculation supports the validity of the bose - gas picture for @xmath153 .",
    "we should point out that , although the bose - gas prediction for the square - root behavior seems to be valid , the `` critical region '' of the square - root behavior in the @xmath0 curve is rather narrow , since the obtained values of @xmath137 and @xmath7 are non - negligibly large .",
    "in fact , the quantity @xmath128 defined by ( [ tag-24 ] ) characterizing the width of the critical region , is very small : 0.012 ( for @xmath99 ) and 0.028 ( for @xmath142 ) .",
    "corresponding values of @xmath132 defined by ( [ tag-25 ] ) are even smaller : @xmath154 ( @xmath99 ) and @xmath155 ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "one notable behavior which we found in the pwfrg calculation is that , on raising @xmath12 from 0 , the @xmath135 curve becomes flatter and flatter , or equivalently , the value of @xmath136 in ( [ tag-23 ] ) becomes smaller and smaller ; there seems to be a critical value @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) at which @xmath136 vanishes .",
    "accordingly , the critical behavior of the @xmath0 curve at @xmath9 changes from square - root type to another one @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) ( fig.4 ) . in the bose - gas picture",
    ", this change of the @xmath0 curve may be understood as the vanishing of the @xmath158-term in the expansion of the one - particle excitation energy @xmath108 .",
    "interestingly , a qualitative change of the static structure factor @xmath159 has been found  @xcite very near @xmath13 .",
    "since both of these changes reflect changes in the ground state and the low - energy excitation mode of the system , it is likely that they have a common origin .    above @xmath13 ,",
    "the square - root behavior reappears .",
    "however , the coefficient @xmath137 becomes positive ( although small ) , implying _ negative _ effective coupling constant ( fig.5 ) .",
    "the square - root behavior itself becomes manifest due to small @xmath160 , but the negative coupling disables us to take the naive bose - gas picture in this region of @xmath12 ; for justification of the picture , we should inspect the `` bound states '' , just as we did in discussing the @xmath0 curve near the upper critical field @xmath8 .",
    "note that for systems in the haldane phase where the orientational order ( characterized by the string order parameter  @xcite ) exists , the  particle \" is a moving domain wall separating two regions each of which has complete orientational order.@xcite in this view , total @xmath66 carried by a low - lying excitation mode is the `` height '' of the wall .",
    "then , if the wall width is narrow ( @xmath161 one lattice spacing ) , we can adopt a similar reasoning as in the previous section justifying the negative coupling bose - gas picture : formation of stable bound states will be forbidden due to the kinematical constraint that the local wall height ( @xmath161 total @xmath66 , for thin wall ) can not exceed @xmath11 .",
    "the actual situation is , however , subtle because the domain - wall is somewhat fuzzy ( due to the zero - spin defects  @xcite ) and its width may not be narrow .",
    "@xcite in this view , we should say that full justification of the bose - gas picture for @xmath162 seems to require further study .",
    "nevertheless , the square - root behavior @xmath16 itself is confirmed by our pwfrg calculation .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the zero - temperature magnetization process ( @xmath0 curve ) of the @xmath23 isotropic antiferromagnetic spin chain with both the bilinear and biquadratic forms of interactions in the range @xmath6 where @xmath12 is the coefficient ratio between the biquadratic term and the bilinear term . quantitative test for the bose - gas picture near the critical fields @xmath8 ( saturation field ) and @xmath9 ( lower critical field ) has been made with the help of the product - wavefunction renormalization - group ( pwfrg ) method which is a variant of s.r .",
    "white s density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) .",
    "near @xmath8 we have derived the correct effective bose - gas coupling constant from the two - down - spin scattering matrix in its low - energy limit .",
    "the resulting delta - function bose gas yields @xmath0 curves which are in good agreement with the pwfrg calculations .",
    "near @xmath9 , the square - root behavior @xmath16 has been confirmed by our pwfrg calculation throughout the range of @xmath12 studied . here",
    "it should be noted a recent finite size scaling calculation by sakai and takahashi gave a consistent result for the @xmath102 case.@xcite we have , however , found two distinct regions of @xmath12 separated by a critical value @xmath163 . in the small @xmath12 region , @xmath15 ,",
    "the effective bose - gas coupling @xmath10 extracted from the pwfrg - calculated @xmath0 curve is positive but small , making the critical region of the square - root behavior rather narrow ; it becomes narrower and narrower on approaching @xmath13 . at @xmath13",
    ", the @xmath0 curve seems to exhibit a different critical behavior @xmath164 with @xmath157 . in the large @xmath12 region , although the square - root behavior is more pronounced due to large value of @xmath165 , the sign of @xmath10 becomes negative , which sharply contrasts to the small-@xmath12 region .    as regards the @xmath0 curve of the bilinear - biquadratic heisenberg chain , cusp - like singularities in the `` middle - field '' region",
    "have been known for integrable @xmath166 chains.@xcite whether a similar behavior can also be found for general , non - integrable cases is an interesting problem .",
    "although we have concentrated on the behavior near the critical fields in the present paper , we have obtained a full @xmath0 curve from @xmath105 to @xmath167 . in the large @xmath12 region , we have actually found a clear cusp - like singularity very similar to the one in the @xmath168 ( lai - sutherland ) model,@xcite whose detailed account will be given in a separate paper .",
    "finally we would like to remark that the bose - gas description which we investigated in the present paper may not be the only one for `` quantitative '' description of the @xmath0 curve of the af spin chain .",
    "for example , in a recent paper , yamamoto@xcite gave a different picture for the ground - state properties of the bilinear - biquadratic chain .",
    "such an analysis may be helpful for clarifying nature of the system in the region @xmath162 .",
    "also , `` quantifying '' other low - energy effective theories is an interesting and important problem . for this purpose , the approach we have taken in section iii where microscopic quantities of the effective theory are extracted from bulk quantities calculated by a reliable method , like the dmrg .",

    "<S> we study the zero - temperature magnetization curve ( @xmath0 curve ) of the one - dimensional quantum antiferromagnet of spin one . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian @xmath1 we consider is of the bilinear - biquadratic form : @xmath2 ( + zeeman term ) where @xmath3 is the spin operator at site @xmath4 and @xmath5 with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on validity of the @xmath7-function bose - gas picture near the two critical fields : upper critical field @xmath8 above which the magnetization saturates and the lower critical field @xmath9 associated with the haldane gap .    as for the behavior near @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> , we take `` low - energy effective s - matrix '' approach where _ correct _ effective bose - gas coupling constant @xmath10 is extracted from the two - down - spin @xmath11-matrix in its low - energy limit . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the resulting value of @xmath10 differs from the spin - wave value . </S>",
    "<S> we draw the @xmath0 curve by using the resultant bose gas , and compare it with numerical calculation where the product - wavefunction renormalization group ( pwfrg ) method , a variant of the s. r. white s density - matrix renormalization group method , is employed . </S>",
    "<S> excellent agreement is seen between the pwfrg calculation and the correctly - mapped bose gas calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> we also test the validity of the bose - gas picture near the lower critical field @xmath9 . comparing the pwfrg - calculated @xmath0 curves with the bose - gas prediction </S>",
    "<S> , we find that there are two distinct regions , i and ii , of @xmath12 separated by a critical value @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) . in the region </S>",
    "<S> i , @xmath15 , the effective bose coupling @xmath10 is positive but rather small . </S>",
    "<S> the small value of @xmath10 makes the `` critical region '' of the square - root behavior @xmath16 very narrow . </S>",
    "<S> further , we find that in the @xmath17 , the square - root behavior transmutes to a different one , @xmath18 with @xmath19 . in the region </S>",
