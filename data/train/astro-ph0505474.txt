    "discovery of grb afterglows has become almost commonplace . however , we are still in a regime where nearly every well - sampled afterglow contributes to our understanding of the phenomenon in new and meaningful ways .",
    "observationally , grb 021211 distinguishes itself in two ways : ( 1 ) it is the second grb for which an optical afterglow was observed within minutes of the burst , thanks to rapid responses by the hete-2 satellite ( crew et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) and three robotic telescopes  raptor ( wozniak et al . 2002 ) ; kait ( li et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) ; and super - lotis ( park , williams & barthelmy 2002 ; this paper ) ; and ( 2 ) it is the first grb for which filtered detections ( beginning 143 seconds after the burst ) and color information ( beginning 38 minutes after the burst ) were obtained at early times .",
    "in addition to observations presented in grb coordinates network ( gcn ) circulars , many groups have presented their observations in peer - reviewed journals : li et al .",
    "( 2003 ) present an unfiltered light curve beginning 105 seconds after the burst ; fox et al .",
    "( 2003 ) present an unfiltered light curve beginning 21 minutes after the burst and filtered optical , nir , and radio observations beginning 2.0 hours after the burst ; pandey et al .",
    "( 2003 ) present filtered optical observations beginning 6.8 hours after the burst ; holland et al .",
    "( 2004 ) present filtered optical and nir observations of both the afterglow and host galaxy beginning 17 hours after the burst and measure the spectral flux distribution of the afterglow around 21 hours after the burst ; and smith et al .",
    "( 2005 ) present submillimeter observations around 25 hours and 10 days after the burst .",
    "finally , della valle et al .",
    "( 2003 ) present photometric and spectral evidence for an associated supernova at late times .    as in the case of grb 990123 ( akerlof et al .",
    "1999 ) , the optical afterglow faded more rapidly at first , presumably due to a reverse shock ( wei 2003 ; fox et al . 2003 ; li et al . 2003 ; holland et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , these afterglows differ in that grb 021211 was @xmath03  4 mag fainter , despite a lower redshift [ @xmath1 for grb 021211 ( vreeswijk et al . 2002 ; della valle et al . 2002 ) vs. @xmath2 for grb 990123 ( hjorth et al . 1999 ) ] ( fox et al . 2003 ; li et al . 2003 ; pandey et al .",
    "2003 ; crew et al .",
    "if it were not for the rapid response of the grb community , grb 021211 might have been called a `` dark burst '' : it faded from r @xmath0 14 mag at @xmath090 sec after the burst ( wozniak et al .",
    "2002 ) to r @xmath3 21 mag about three hours later .",
    "many bursts that would have been called `` dark '' in the bepposax era are being and will be called `` dim '' in the hete-2 , integral , and swift era due to faster responses .",
    "some authors have modeled grb 021211 with an emphasis on its environment .",
    "kumar & panaitescu ( 2003 ) argue that the grb and afterglow were produced by the same shock and within this framework constrain physical parameters for both constant - density and wind - swept media .",
    "panaitescu & kumar ( 2004 ) consider the early - time afterglows of both grb 021211 and grb 990123 in the context of reverse - forward shock ( for both constant - density and wind - swept media ) and wind - bubble scenarios and find that the reverse - forward shock scenario is preferred .",
    "chevalier , li & fransson ( 2004 ) argue for a wind - swept medium with the cooling break redward of the r band and within this framework find wind densities that are low compared to galactic wolf - rayet stars ( see also panaitescu & kumar 2004 ) .",
    "finally , dado , dar & de rujula ( 2003 ) model grb 021211 within the framework of their cannonball model .    in  2",
    ", we present fun grb collaboration observations of grb 021211 , which include the earliest filtered detections and color information for an afterglow in the pre - swift era . in  3 , we fit standard afterglow and extinction curve models to these and other groups data and show that within the first few hours after the burst one and possibly two significant chromatic variations are superimposed on this `` standard model '' behavior . in  4 , we compare our results to previous modeling results and discuss possible reasons for these chromatic variations , including the possibility that they are due to a dust echo .",
    "we also constrain physical parameters that describe the afterglow and surrounding medium for a variety of scenarios and discuss why grb 021211 s afterglow is so faint .",
    "we draw conclusions in  5 .",
    "long - duration , x - ray rich grb 021211 was detected by hete-2 s fregate , wxm , and sxc instruments on december 11 , 2002 at 11:18:34 utc ( crew et al .",
    "the initial spacecraft localization was 14@xmath4 in radius and reported in near - real time , only 22 seconds after the burst .",
    "ground analysis of the wxm and sxc data , reported 131 minutes after the burst , improved the localization to 2@xmath4 in radius and was consistent with the initial localization .",
    "fox & price ( 2002 ) announced the discovery of an r @xmath5 18 mag and fading , stationary point source in the error circle 53 minutes after the burst .",
    "while the pair labored , the robotic telescopes of three groups had already responded to the alert . for only the second time in the afterglow era ,",

    "2003 ) : w. li ( private communication ) and p. price ( private communication ) kindly provided us with their calibration stars . using the bvr@xmath11i@xmath11 magnitudes of these stars from henden ( 2002 ) , we fitted extinguished blackbody functions to each of these stars and then integrated these fitted functions against the appropriate spectral response curve .",
    "this resulted in small , 0.05 and 0.03 magnitude offsets in the calibration of the kait and neat measurements , respectively .",
    "we now fit standard afterglow and extinction curve models to these and other groups data and show that within the first few hours after the burst one and possibly two significant chromatic variations are superimposed on this `` standard model '' behavior .",

    "we model the afterglow with two components , corresponding to reverse and forward shocks .",

    "we fit this model to the data using bayesian inference ( e.g. , reichart 2001a ; lee et al .",
    "2001 ; galama et al .",
    "2003 ) : the posterior probability distribution is equal to the product of the prior probability distribution and the likelihood function .",

    "many of the parameters of the source - frame extinction curve model and all of the parameters of the ly@xmath14 forest absorption and galactic extinction curve models can be constrained a priori .",
    "the source - frame extinction curve model of reichart ( 2001a ) is a function of eight parameters : the source - frame v - band extinction magnitude @xmath33 , @xmath34 , the intercept @xmath35 and slope @xmath36 of the linear component of the source - frame uv extinction curve , the strength @xmath37 , width @xmath38 and center @xmath39 of the uv bump component of the extinction curve , and the strength @xmath40 of the fuv excess component of the extinction curve .",

    "reichart ( 2001a ) determines prior probability distributions for @xmath42 , @xmath35 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath41 , which means that the values of these parameters can be weighted by fairly narrow distributions , the description of which sometimes depends on other parameters ( @xmath36 and @xmath43 ) , a priori .",
    "we adopt these priors here , which can be thought of as increasing the degrees of freedom by five . also , the galactic extinction curve model of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) is a function of @xmath44b@xmath45v@xmath46 mag for this line of sight ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) and a single parameter , @xmath47 .",
    "we adopt a prior for this parameter that is log normally distributed with mean @xmath48 and width 0.1 , which closely approximates the distribution of values of this parameter along random lines of sight through the galaxy ( e.g. , reichart 2001a ; lee et al .",
    "2002 ; galama et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we fit our model to the data for each of the four standard cases of sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 ) and chevalier & li ( 2000 ) , which relate @xmath20 to @xmath22 assuming ( 1 ) propagation through either a constant - density ( ism ) or wind - swept ( wind ) medium , and ( 2 ) a cooling break that is either redward ( red ) or blueward ( blue ) of the observed optical and nir frequencies : for the ism - red and wind - red cases , @xmath49 ; for the ism - blue case , @xmath50 ; and for the wind - blue case , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the power - law index of the electron - energy distribution .",
    "since the temporal index is well constrained by the data , these additional constraints can be powerful tools for separating the intrinsic spectrum from extinction effects ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "for purposes of comparison , we also fit our model to the data free of constraints on @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "best fits are found by maximizing the posterior .",

    "furthermore , the wind - blue fit is consistent with the constraint - free fit , differing from it at only the 0.6@xmath32 credible level .",
    "the primary difference between these cases is that the wind - blue case requests a shallow intrinsic spectrum , @xmath53 , and a small amount of extinction , @xmath54 mag , where the other cases request steeper intrinsic spectra and would fit better if @xmath55 mag were possible ( see  4 ) .",
    "for the wind - blue case , we find that @xmath56 @xmath57jy , @xmath58 day , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 mag , @xmath64 ( 1@xmath32 ) , and @xmath65 mag",

    "grbs 021004 and 030329 are extreme examples  but further modeling of such variations is beyond the scope of this paper , and frankly beyond the quality of this data set .",
    "however , this does lend some credibility to the possibility that the second variation is temporal instead of chromatic .",
    "a final possibility is that the r point at the end of the third time slice is a statistical variation : given 80 points , the probability of encountering a 4.8@xmath32 variation is 1 in 7900 ( ruled out at the 3.8@xmath32 confidence level ) .",
    "finally , we refit the four standard cases to the data , but this time we accommodate the first , chromatic variation with the above simple model and eliminate the second variation , whether chromatic or temporal , by not fitting to the two points of the third time slice . compared to the wind - blue case , we now rule out the ism - red and wind - red cases at the 6.3@xmath32 credible level and the ism - blue case at the 3.2@xmath32 credible level .",

    "however , in  4.2 we point out that emission from the reverse shock is not necessarily expected to fade quickly in a wind - swept medium if @xmath92 and other physical parameters are lower than expected , which appears to be the case for this grb .",
    "holland et al . (",
    "2004 ) also adopt the ism - blue case . the primary difference between their fit and ours",
    "is that we permit source - frame extinction .",
    "when we fit the ism - blue case , we find that @xmath93 ( variations untreated ) or @xmath94 ( variations treated ) with @xmath95 mag , which is very similar to their fit in a time slice around 0.88 days after the burst : @xmath96 with @xmath33 assumed to be zero . however , if source - frame extinction is permitted and one fits to all of the data , we find that the wind - blue case with a small to moderate amount of source - frame extinction , @xmath63 mag ( variations untreated ) or @xmath97 mag ( variations treated ) , is preferred at the 3.1@xmath32 ( variations untreated ) or 3.2@xmath32 ( variations treated ) credible level . figures 4e and 5e can be directly compared to figure 3 of holland et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "finally , chevalier , li & fransson ( 2004 ) adopt the wind - red case , guided by sparse color information that was available at the time , including the two points of figure 4c , which we have already identified as discrepant , possibly due to excess red light at this time (  3.2 ) .",
    "permitting source - frame extinction and fitting to all of the data , we rule this case out at the 7.3@xmath32 ( variations untreated ) or 6.3@xmath32 ( variations treated ) credible level .",
    "the wind - blue case , however , requires a relatively hard electron energy distribution ",
    "so a break at higher energies is required .",
    "bhattacharya ( 2001 ) determines the effect of @xmath99 on the standard equations : by introducing a cut - off frequency @xmath100 such that @xmath101 and assuming that @xmath100 evolves directly with the bulk lorentz factor of the shock , they find results similar to the standard prescriptions .",
    "galama et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found a similar hard electron energy index for grb 010222 , though other ideas , such as a continuous injection of energy ( bjornsson et al .",

    "but for the wind - blue case , and using the analytic expressions of granot & sari ( 2002 ) , we now constrain physical parameters that describe the afterglow and surrounding medium for a variety of scenarios .",
    "the first constraint comes from the expression of granot & sari ( 2002 ) for the brightness of the afterglow in the frequency range of our observations , which for the wind - blue case is max\\{@xmath102,@xmath103 } @xmath104 , where @xmath102 is the self - absorption frequency , @xmath103 is the typical synchrotron frequency , and @xmath105 is the electron cooling frequency .",
    "this corresponds to segment g in their figure 1 .",
    "for @xmath106 , a luminosity distance of @xmath107 cm ( assuming that @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 km s@xmath111 mpc@xmath111 ) , and an extinction - corrected @xmath112 = 19 @xmath57jy at 0.1 days after the burst , we find : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the electron energy fraction when @xmath99 , @xmath115 is the magnetic field energy fraction , @xmath92 measures the density of the wind - swept medium , and @xmath116 erg is the total energy of the shock , if spherical .",
    "the second constraint comes from the expression of granot & sari ( 2002 ) for @xmath117 and the fact that the data are well described by the wind - blue case even at early times ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "taking @xmath118 prior to 3.9 minutes after the burst  the time when the forward shock first outshines the reverse shock in the r band  yields : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the time that @xmath105 passes above the r band .",
    "the third constraint is similar to the second in that we take @xmath121 prior to 3.9 minutes after the burst , else the light curve would have faded much more slowly at this time , as @xmath122 ( chevalier & li 2000 ; chevalier , li & fransson 2004 ) : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the time that @xmath103 passes below the r band .",

    "consequently , @xmath115 is likely considerably more than 0.04 , in which case @xmath165 can be no more than a factor of three greater and is likely less and @xmath92 can only be less .    finally , for scenario d , using the expression of granot & sari ( 2002 ) that corresponds to their segment a",

    "@xmath114 and @xmath92 are considerably lower than canonical values .",
    "since @xmath174 ( equation 3 ) , both of these contribute to the faintness of the afterglow (  1 ) .",
    "if we allow ourselves to be guided by the standard - energy result ( frail et al . 2001 ; bloom , frail & kulkarni 2003 ) , @xmath150 is also lower than what one might expect : for wind - swept media , the total energy released in gamma rays is typically measured to be many @xmath9 10@xmath175 erg ( bloom , frail & kulkarni 2003 ) .",
    "given that the isotropic - equivalent energy in gamma rays for grb 021211 was @xmath176 erg ( holland et al .",
    "2004 ) or @xmath152 erg ( lamb et al .",
    "2004 ) , this implies a jet opening / viewing angle of @xmath520@xmath177 , which is about three times the canonical value .",
    "hence , @xmath150 is probably about an order of magnitude less than what one might have expected .",
    "consequently , we find that grb 021211 s afterglow is faint for a combination of 3  4 reasons : ( 1 ) a low fraction of energy in relativistic electrons , ( 2 ) a low density for the wind - swept medium , implying either a low mass - loss rate and/or a high wind velocity for the progenitor , ( 3 ) a wide opening / viewing angle for the jet , and possibly ( 4 ) moderate source - frame extinction (  3.2 ) .",
    "furthermore , with @xmath178 and @xmath115 likely much greater than 0.04 the jet appears to be significantly far from equipartition and magnetically dominated .",
    "this is similar to sn 1993j , for which the magnetic field energy density is @xmath510@xmath179 times the relativistic particle energy density ( chandra et al .",
    "2004 ) , but dissimilar to sn 1998bw ( kulkarni et al . 1998 ) and sn 2002ap ( bjornsson & fransson 2004 ) , which appear to be near equipartition .",
    "these findings are supported by the existence of the bright reverse shock : fox et al .",
    "( 2003 ) dismiss the possibility of a wind - swept medium because for canonical values of @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath92 , and @xmath150 , @xmath182 is expected to be significantly less than @xmath183 , in which case the reverse shock is expected to fade away quickly and not be bright ( chevalier & li 2000 ) . however , this is not the case when @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and/or @xmath92 are sufficiently low .",
    "taking @xmath184 and @xmath185 and substituting equations 17 , 18 , and 19 into equations 45 and 47 of chevalier & li ( 2000 ) , we find : @xmath186 for @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 .",
    "for @xmath190 minute after the burst , corresponding to the beginning of the first detection of the reverse shock ( wozniak et al .",
    "2002 ) , @xmath150 need only be greater than @xmath50.03 for @xmath191 .",
    "globally , the data are well described by the model of  3.1 , but superimposed on this global behavior are small , but significant variations from @xmath040 minutes after the burst until possibly @xmath06.0 hours after the burst (  3.2 ) .",
    "this model does not explain these variations .",
    "it merely attemps to accommodate them with a higher value of the slop parameter : @xmath192 mag .",
    "the slop parameter is a global measure of the scatter of the data around the model , beyond what can be accounted for by the data s error bars (  3.1 ) .",
    "furthermore , at least the first of these variations appears to be chromatic , with a relative increase of blue light with respect to red light around two hours after the burst , and possibly , but less certainly , a reversal of this two hours later (  3.2 ) .",
    "when we modify the model and fit to better treat these variations , @xmath32 decreases to @xmath193 mag (  3.2 ) .",
    "one potential explanation for these variations is that we have undersampled a light curve that is varying in time in such a way as to mimic a chromatic effect .",
    "indeed , the high signal - to - noise light curves of grbs 021004 and 030329 revealed temporal variations and a variety of explanations have been proposed , including variations in the density of the external medium ( e.g. , lazzati et al .",
    "2002 ) , refreshed shocks ( e.g. , granot , nakar & piran 2003 ) , and patchy shells ( e.g. , kumar & piran 2000 ) . however , none of these occur on a sufficiently short timescale to explain the variation around two hours after the burst ( figure 3 ) .",
    "however , a temporal variation can not be ruled out for the possible reversal of this effect two hours later (  3.2 ) .",
    "another potential explanation is that a spectral break , presumably the cooling break , is passing through our data around 2  4 hours after the burst .",
    "although this is difficult to reconcile with the blue excess of figure 4b , since the spectrum is supposed to be half of a spectral index steeper blueward of the cooling break , it is not necessarily inconsistent with the possible red excess of figure 4c .",
    "however , the spectra in figures 4a and 4e would then differ by half of a spectral index , which would be noticeable .",
    "another potential explanation is that we observed a dust echo  light scattered by dust into the line of sight and received with a time delay due to the greater path length .",
    "waxman & draine ( 2000 ) and esin & blandford ( 2000 ) originally proposed dust echoes as an alternative explanation for the supernova - like components to the afterglows of grb 980326 ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 ) and grb 970228 ( reichart 1999 ; galama et al",
    "reichart ( 2001b ) modeled and computed dust echo light curves and spectral flux distributions and found that while dust echoes can mimic supernova light curves they can not mimic supernova spectral flux distributions , at least not near the spectral peak .",
    "moran & reichart ( 2004 ) take the model of reichart ( 2001b ) and instead of applying it to dust shells of inner radius @xmath510@xmath194 cm , which is what is required to mimic supernova light curves , they apply it to dust shells of inner radius @xmath510@xmath195 cm , which is typical of late - type wc wolf - rayet stars , the likely progenitors of grbs .",
    "moran & reichart ( 2004 ) find that for ( 1 ) wind - swept media , ( 2 ) bright optical flashes  reverse shocks that outshine the forward shock at early times  and ( 3 ) wide jet opening angles , dust echoes may be observable on a timescale of minutes to hours after the burst .",
    "furthermore , the characteristic signature will be an excess of blue light ( since blue light scatters preferentially ) that quickly transitions to an excess of red light ( due to increasing path lengths through dust with increasing time delay ) . since all of these conditions appear to be met for grb 021211 (  3.1 , ",
    "4.1 ,  4.2 ) , and excess blue light is observed on this timescale , as well as a possible transition to excess red light hours later , we now test this hypothesis in two ways :    \\1 .",
    "equation 6 of moran & reichart ( 2004 ) gives the turn - on time of an idealized , on - axis dust echo as a function of the inner radius @xmath196 of the circum - progenitor dust shell and the initial opening angle @xmath197 of the jet .",
    "dust echoes should not be visible at very early times because x rays from the burst and uv light from the optical flash should sublimate the dust within @xmath197 of the jet axis this close to the burst ( e.g. , waxman & draine 2000 ; fruchter , krolik & rhoads 2001 ; reichart 2001c ) .",
    "taking the turn - on time to be @xmath50.4 of the peak time ( reichart 2001b ; moran & reichart 2004 ) and taking the peak time for grb 021211 to be @xmath52.2 hours , we solve for @xmath196 : @xmath198 for a wide jet opening angle , this yields @xmath199 cm , which is the expectation if late - type wc stars are indeed the progenitors of grbs .",
    "however , given that the isotropic - equivalent energy in gamma rays alone was @xmath151 erg ( holland et al .",
    "2004 ) or @xmath152 erg ( lamb et al . 2004 ) and that @xmath200 (  4.2 ) , the deceleration radius @xmath201 was likely greater than @xmath202 cm ( e.g. , equation 7 of moran & reichart 2005 ) and consequently a value for @xmath196 likely can not be deduced .",
    "equation 5 of moran & reichart ( 2004 ) , but with @xmath201 substitued for @xmath196 , gives the peak brightness of the optical flash off of the jet axis , at angles around @xmath197 , as a function of the peak brightness of the dust echo , the deceleration radius , the optical depth @xmath203 through the rest of the dust shell at frequency @xmath204 , also at angles around @xmath197 , and the duration of the optical flash . taking the peak brightness of the dust echo to be @xmath519 mag and the duration of the optical flash to be @xmath530 seconds ( e.g. , sari & piran 1999 ) , we find : @xmath205 using our best fit (  3.1 ) , extrapolation of the reverse shock light curve back to @xmath030 seconds after the onset of the burst yields r @xmath206 mag .",
    "however , given the known distance to grb 021211 @xmath207 would have to be significantly fainter lest the dust be sublimated in these directions as well , this close to the burst .",
    "for longer optical flash durations , @xmath208 , and/or a greater forward scattering probability than what esin & blandford ( 2000 ) , reichart ( 2001b ) , and moran & reichart ( 2004 ) assume , @xmath207 would be fainter , but not sufficiently .",
    "alternatively , prior fragmentation of the dust to pah levels by gamma rays from the burst might harden it against sublimation , since atomic bonds would then be more difficult to break",
    ".    finally , we point out that neither of these estimates hold in the case of a jet with a narrow opening angle but a large viewing angle .",
    "grb 021211 is one of only a handful of grbs for which processes other than the forward shock have been identified at optical wavelengths , which has made it one of the most studied grbs . in this paper",
    ", we present additional , multi - band observations of this event , ranging from minutes to months after the burst , which in combination with all previously published observations have allowed us to deeply probe the physics of this grb and properties of its circum - progenitor environment .",
    "coupling the standard afterglow model with a general - purpose extinction curve model , we find that the afterglow is best described by propagation through a wind - swept medium , which implies a massive - star progenitor ( e.g. , price et al .",
    "the jet itself appears to be significantly far from equipartition and magnetically dominated .",
    "indeed , the low fraction of energy in relativistic electrons appears to be the primary reason that this afterglow is so faint .",
    "this , combined with a low - density medium , a wide jet opening / viewing angle , and possibly moderate extinction might be important clues as to why many afterglows are dark / dim in the swift era , even at early times after the burst .",
    "these findings are supported by the existence of the bright reverse shock  in a wind - swept medium this should only be possible if @xmath92 is low and/or the jet is significantly far from equipartition , meaning that either @xmath180 or @xmath181 is low as well .    finally , we observed one and possibly two significant chromatic variations hours after the burst .",
    "we discuss possible reasons for these variations , including the possibility that they are due to a dust echo : the three primary requirements for an observable dust echo are a wind - swept medium , a bright optical flash , and a wide jet opening angle , and the characteristic signature should be an excess of blue light that quickly reddens , all of which appear to be satisfied for grb 021211 . however ,",
    "in the case of grb 021211 this would imply an off - axis brightness and hence luminosity for the optical flash that would probably sublimate too much dust in these directions .",
    "rapid , multi - band , and preferably simultaneous multi - band observations of future grbs might shed more light on this interesting possibility .",
