    "zero energy states are well known for the one - dimensional eigenvalue - problem for the dirac particle with a spatially dependent mass .",
    "such a problem naturally arises in various contexts , both in condensed matter and in high - energy physics @xcite .",
    "these are super - symmetric quantum mechanics @xcite , fractional charge @xcite and solitons in polyacetylene @xcite . for the monotonous mass distribution the wavefunction corresponding to the zero energy state is localized in the vicinity of the point were the mass vanishes .",
    "let us consider the two - dimensional case .",
    "assuming that the mass depends on a single variable only , say @xmath0 , we come back to the one - dimensional problem .",
    "however , in two dimensions the motion is allowed not only along the @xmath0-axis , but also along the perpendicular to it @xmath1-axis .",
    "if the mass vanishes at the point @xmath2 , the line @xmath3 is the zero - mass line ( zml ) .",
    "our two - dimensional problem reduces to the one - dimensional problem completely if we assume that the particle does not move along zml . for non - zero values of the momentum @xmath4 along zml",
    "the energy of the particle is given by the linear relation , @xmath5 , i.e. the one - dimensional zero - energy state becomes a linear dispersion mode ( ldm ) in two dimensions .",
    "ldms naturally appear as edge states for inverted band semiconductors @xcite as well as for a certain model of the quantum hall effect@xcite .",
    "though single - particle ldms in quantum hall regime might not be a sufficient description for conventional two - dimensional electron gas@xcite , this description seems to be adequate for the case of narrow graphene ribbons @xcite .",
    "another recent examples where zml are essentially involved are given by topologically protected edge states in cdte / hgte / cdte topological insulators @xcite , graphene on boron nitride @xcite , and chemically functionalized graphene @xcite where for an inhomogeneous functionalization the mass term can in general change its sign .",
    "ldms arise in gapped bilayer graphene @xcite and chiral p - wave superconductors @xcite . changing a width of cdte / hgte / cdte quantum well or applying a gate voltage one",
    "can also create zml in bulk . though our consideration will be formally applicable in all these cases , for the sake of definiteness we assume in this paper that ldms relate to edge states in two - dimensional topological insulators .",
    "an effective dynamics of charge carriers in topological insulators @xcite is governed by the dirac hamiltonian with a spatially dependent mass term .",
    "this term vanishes along zml giving rise to ldm .",
    "this mode lies in a gap for bulk states .",
    "along a single straight zml the linear dispersion mode propagates only in one direction .",
    "this unidirectional edge mode is very similar to unidirectional edge states in conventional semiconductors placed in the high magnetic field .",
    "it is well known , that these states support the quantum hall current @xcite . the existence of unidirectional channels in topological insulators in zero magnetic field is referred to , by analogy with the quantum hall effect , as quantum spin hall effect @xcite .    from the physical point of view a mass square landscape in a topological insulator forms a waveguide around zml ( see fig .",
    "[ fig::topo ] ) .",
    "ldm in such a waveguide corresponds to zero transversal momentum , i.e. to the rest in the direction transversal to zml .",
    "this stands in stark contrast to the conventional schrdinger particle in a soft - walls waveguide , where the lowest transversal energy is positive .",
    "ldms in topological insulators are known to be topologically protected against scattering by non - magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "topological protection results from the spatial separation of states traveling in different directions , thus the backscattering should be attenuated by the probability to tunnel through the bulk of a sample .",
    "this peculiarity is very similar to the behavior of conducting states in quantum hall effect . in ideal system at zero temperature",
    "it is the tunneling between edge states which determines an accuracy of quantum hall plateaus .",
    "the assumption about the spatial separation of states traveling in different directions does not take into account peculiarities of quantum tunneling .",
    "indeed , let us consider a ribbon with two parallel zml at its opposite edges and assume that mass does not depend on the variable along the line .",
    "one can expect that the crossing of straight lines corresponding to a linear dispersion turns into the avoided crossing .",
    "obviously , this effect does not depend on the symmetry :",
    "a transition from a crossing to an avoided crossing caused by tunneling is generic .    due to the gap opening the ldm cone turns into two branches , almost linear at large momenta .",
    "let us consider an upper branch . for large negative momenta",
    "the wavefunction is localized at one edge of the sample and for large positive momenta it is localized at the other edge . since the wavefunction smoothly depends on the longitudinal momentum , we should conclude that at a certain longitudinal momentum amplitudes of the wavefunction are comparable at both zmls .",
    "at this point states traveling in different directions are not spatially separated and the topological protection may break ( see fig .  [ fig::topo ] ) . in section [ zz ]",
    "we illustrate this effect by an example of a symmetric mass distribution .",
    "particles corresponding ldm on the mass square surface .",
    "red and green spheres illustrate edge states with large longitudinal momenta .",
    "they are localized at a single zero - mass line .",
    "blue spheres illustrate states with small longitudinal momenta .",
    "such states are localized at both zmls simultaneously.,width=264 ]    the tunneling between zmls has been studied experimentally @xcite . in this work the differential conductance measurements in the integer quantum hall regime between two parallel edge channels were reported .",
    "theoretically@xcite one considered the tunneling between quantum hall edge states via the landau - zener - like mechanism : it was assumed that the main contribution comes from the vicinity of a point were edge channels are the most close to each other .",
    "topological protection of a single zml should lead to a substantial change of dynamical properties of ldm .",
    "indeed , let us consider an adiabatically bent zml .",
    "for a conventional schrdinger particle the bending implies a geometric potential , proportional to the square of the curvature at every point @xcite .",
    "this barrier results in the appearance of a trapped mode and backscattering .",
    "both effects are forbidden for ldm due to the topological protection . in the section [ bent ]",
    "we show that the bending of zml , indeed , tends only to the emergence of geometric phases .",
    "we assume that the dynamics of charge carriers is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath6 where the mass @xmath7 vanishes along the line @xmath8 . here",
    "we put @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the fermi velocity . for a given energy @xmath11",

    "we put @xmath48 and take the branch corresponding to @xmath49 .",
    "equations ( [ cf ] ) give @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 correspond to @xmath48 . if @xmath51 , @xmath52 are known then the functions @xmath53 , @xmath54 for @xmath55 can be reconstructed as @xmath56 let us multiply the first equation in ( [ t1t2 ] ) by @xmath51 , the second one by @xmath52 and subtract the second result from the first one .",

    "in contrast to the double well problem ( see @xcite , p.  183 ) this effect is not a consequence of a spatial symmetry .",
    "the delocalization at zero longitudinal momentum may destroy the topological protection against disorder .",
    "let us now look how the localization appears at non - zero longitudinal momenta . for @xmath60",
    "we find @xmath61 if @xmath62 and @xmath63 if @xmath64 .",
    "thus for large positive longitudinal momenta @xmath65 are localized at one zml and for large negative longitudinal momenta these functions are localized at another zml .    the schematic view of the dispersion relation and the corresponding wavefunction reconstruction ( insets ) .",
    "one sees that at zero longitudinal momenta the wavefunction is not localized at a single zml.,width=264 ]    for symmetric mass distribution ( [ m2 ] ) we can obtain an analytic estimation for the spitting .",
    "let us change @xmath0 to @xmath66 in ( [ t1t2 ] ) .",
    "taking into account that @xmath7 is an even function we find @xmath67 thus we conclude @xmath68 .",
    "let us multiply the first equation in ( [ t1t2 ] ) by @xmath51 and integrate over @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain @xmath69 since the function @xmath70 obeys the schrdinger equation ( [ a1 ] ) with potential ( [ v1 ] ) for small @xmath71 it remains exponentially small for any @xmath72 except the vicinity of the point @xmath73 . in",
    "this vicinity @xmath70 grows due to the focusing in a shadow region ( an effect similar to the arago spot , fig.[fig::tilted ] ) , but nevertheless remains small .",
    "therefore we can neglect an integral in the last equality in ( [ doublewell ] ) and write @xmath74 where ( [ eta2exact ] ) was used to approximate @xmath75 in the region @xmath72 . using ( [ eta2exact ] )",
    "again we find @xmath76 the integral in ( [ py ] ) can be computed using the laplace method .",
    "it gives @xmath77 whence @xmath78 thus for the splitting we obtain @xmath79    though the explicit estimation ( [ splitsym ] ) of the splitting holds only for the specific symmetric mass distribution ( [ m2 ] ) , one can expect that for a generic case the splitting in ldm for a system with two zmls is proportional to @xmath80 where @xmath81 are positions of zmls .",
    "in contrast to the famous double - well problem , the ground state @xmath82 of ( [ a1 ] ) , ( [ a2 ] ) is still determined by the tunneling , since for any @xmath7 , every well treated apart generates a zero eigenenergy . for the double",

    "this energy gain is the consequence of the centrifugal force .",
