    "a model serves as a mathematical abstraction of the physical system , providing a framework for system analysis and controller synthesis .",
    "since such mathematical representations are based on assumptions specific to the process being modeled , it s important to quantify the reliability to which the model is consistent with the physical observations .",
    "model quality assessment is imperative for applications where the model needs to be used for prediction ( e.g. weather forecasting , stock market ) or safety - critical control design ( e.g. aerospace , nuclear , systems biology ) purposes .",
    "here it is important to realize that a model can only be validated against experimental observations , not against another model .",
    "thus a _ model validation problem _ can be stated as : _ given a candidate model and experimentally observed measurements of the physical system , how well does the model replicate the experimental measurements ? _ it has been argued in the literature @xcite that the term ` model validation ' is a misnomer since it would take infinite number of experimental observations to do so .",
    "hence the term ` model invalidation ' or ` falsification ' @xcite is preferred . in this paper , instead of hard invalidation , we will consider the validation / invalidation problem in a probabilistically relaxed sense",
    ".      broadly speaking , there have been three distinct frameworks in which the model validation problem has been attempted till now .",
    "* one * is a discrete formulation in _ temporal logic framework _",
    "@xcite which has been extended to account probabilistic models @xcite . *",
    "second * is the @xmath0 _ control framework _ where time - domain @xcite , frequency domain @xcite and mixed domain @xcite model validation methods have been studied assuming structured norm - bounded uncertainty in linear dynamics setting .",
    "the * third * framework involves deductive inference based on barrier certificates @xcite which was shown to encompass a large class of nonlinear models including differential - algebraic equations @xcite , dynamic uncertainties described by integral quadratic constraints @xcite , stochastic @xcite and hybrid dynamics @xcite .    in statistical setting",
    ", model validation has been addressed from system identification perspective @xcite where the main theme is to validate an identified nominal model through correlation analysis of the residuals .",
    "a polynomial chaos framework has also been proposed @xcite for model validation .",
    "gevers _ et .",
    "@xcite have connected the robust control framework with prediction error based identification for frequency - domain validation of linear systems . in another vein , using bayesian conditioning , lee and poolla @xcite showed that for _ parametric _ uncertainty models , the statistical validation problem may be reduced to the computation of relative weighted volumes of convex sets .",
    "however , for _ nonparametric _ models :  the situation is significantly more complicated \" @xcite and to the best of our knowledge , has not been addressed in the literature .",
    "recently , in the spirit of weak stochastic realization problem @xcite , ugrinovskii @xcite investigated the conditions for which the output of a stochastic nonlinear system can be realized through perturbation of a nominal stochastic _ linear _ system .    in practice",
    ", one often encounters the situation where a model is either proposed from physics - based reasoning or a reduced order model is derived for computational convenience . in either case , the model can be linear or nonlinear , continuous or discrete - time , and in general , it s not possible to make any a - priori assumption about the noise .",
    "given the experimental data and such a candidate model for the physical process , our task is to answer :  to what extent , the proposed model is valid ? \" in addition to quantify such degree of validation , one must also be able to demonstrate that the answer is _ provably correct _ in the face of uncertainty .",
    "this brings forth the notion of _ probabilistically robust model validation_. in this paper , we will show how to construct such a _ robust validation certificate _",
    ", guaranteeing the performance of probabilistic model validation algorithm .      with respect to the literature ,",
    "the contributions of this paper are as follows",
    ".    1 .   instead of interval - valued structured uncertainty ( as in @xmath0 control framework ) or moment based uncertainty ( as in parametric statistics framework )",
    ", this paper deals with model validation in the sense of nonparametric statistics .",
    "uncertainties in the model are quantified in terms of the probability density functions ( pdfs ) of the associated random variables .",
    "we argue that such a formulation offers several advantages . _",
    "firstly _ , we show that model uncertainties in the parameters , initial states and input disturbance , can be propagated accurately by spatio - temporally evolving the joint state and output pdfs .",
    "since experimental data usually come in the form of histograms , it s a more natural quantification of uncertainty than specifying sets @xcite to which the trajectories are contained at each instant of time . however , if needed , such sets can be recovered from the supports of the instantaneous pdfs . _",
    "secondly _ , as we ll see in section 5 , instead of simply invalidating a model , our methodology allows to estimate the probability that a proposed model is valid or invalid .",
    "this can help to decide which specific aspects of the model need further refinement .",
    "hard invalidation methods do nt cater such constructive information .",
    "_ thirdly _ , the framework can handle both discrete - time and continuous - time nonlinear models which need not be polynomial .",
    "previous work like @xcite dealt with semialgebraic nonlinearities and relied on sum of squares ( sos ) decomposition @xcite for computational tractability . from an implementation point of view , the approach presented in this paper does nt suffer from such conservatism .",
    "2 .   due to the uncertainties in initial conditions , parameters , and process noise",
    ", one needs to compare output ensembles instead of comparing individual output realizations .",
    "this requires a metric to quantify closeness between the experimental data and the model in the sense of distribution .",
    "we propose _ wasserstein distance _ to compare the output pdfs and argue why commonly used information - theoretic notions like _ kullback - leibler divergence _ may not be appropriate for this purpose .",
    "we show that the uncertainty propagation through continuous or discrete - time dynamics can be done via numerically efficient meshless algorithms , even when the model is high - dimensional and strongly nonlinear .",
    "moreover , we outline how to compute the wasserstein distance in such settings .",
    "further , bringing together ideas from analysis of randomized algorithms , we give sample - complexity bounds for robust validation inference .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the problem setup .",
    "then we expound on the three steps of our validation framework , viz .",
    "uncertainty propagation , distributional comparison and construction of validation certificates in section 3 , 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "we provide numerical examples in section 6 , to illustrate the ideas presented in this paper .",
    "the concept of worst - case initial uncertainty related to model discrimination , is addressed in section 7 .",
    "section 8 presents some results for discrete - time linear gaussian systems , followed by conclusions in section 9 .",
    "we use the superscript @xmath1 to denote matrix transpose , @xmath2 to denote kronecker product , and the symbol @xmath3 to denote minimum of two real numbers .",
    "the notation @xmath4 stands for generalized hypergeometric function .",
    "the symbols @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are used for normal , uniform and arcsine distributions , respectively .",

    "@xmath10 denote joint pdfs over instantaneous states and parameters , for the true and model dynamics , respectively .",
    "similarly , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively denote joint pdfs over output spaces @xmath13 and @xmath14 at time @xmath15 , for the true and model dynamics . the symbol @xmath16 is used to denote the extended state vector obtained by augmenting the state ( @xmath17 ) and parameter ( @xmath18 ) vectors .",
    "we use @xmath19 to denote indicator function and # to denote cardinality . unless stated otherwise , @xmath20 stands for dirac delta .",
    "the symbol @xmath21 denotes the @xmath22-by-@xmath22 identity matrix , @xmath23 denotes gradient operator with respect to vector @xmath17 , @xmath24 stands for the vectorization operator , and @xmath25 denotes the frobenius norm . @xmath26 and @xmath27 stand for trace and determinant of a matrix .",
    "_ and _ i.p .",
    "_ refer to convergence in _ almost sure _ and _ in probability _ sense .",
    "the shorthand @xmath28 means partial derivative with respect to variable @xmath29 , @xmath30 denotes support of a function , and @xmath31 stands for error function .",
    "the proposed framework is based on the evolution of densities in output space , instead of evolution of individual trajectories , as in the lyapunov framework .",
    "intuitively , characteristics of the input to output mapping is revealed by the growth or depletion of trajectory concentrations in the output - space .",
    "growth in concentration , or increased density , defines regions in where the trajectories accumulate .",
    "this corresponds to regions with slow time scale dynamics or time invariance .",
    "similarly , depletion of concentration in a set implies fast - scale dynamics or unstable manifold .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite for an introduction to analysis of dynamical systems using trajectory densities .",
    "this idea of comparing dynamical systems based on density functions , have been presented before by sun and mehta @xcite in the context of filtering , and by georgiou @xcite in the context of matching power spectral densities .      given the experimental measurements of the physical system in the form of a time - varying distribution ( such as histograms ) , we propose to compare the _ shape _ or _ concentration profile _ of this measured output density , with that predicted by the model . at every instant of time ,",
    "if the model - predicted density matches with the experimental one  _ reasonably well _ \" ( to be made precise later in the paper ) , we conclude that the model is validated with high _ confidence _ ( to be computed for guaranteeing quality of inference ) .      the rationale behind comparing the distributional shapes for model validation comes from the fact that the presence of uncertainties mask the difference between individual output realizations .",
    "uncertainties in initial conditions , parameters and noise result different realizations of the trajectory or integral curve of the dynamical system .",
    "regions of high ( low ) concentration of trajectories correspond to regions of high ( low ) probability .",
    "thus a model validation procedure should naturally aim to compare concentrations of the trajectories between the measurements and model - predictions , instead of comparing individual realizations of them , which would be meaningful only in the absence of uncertainties .",
    "we would like to point out that in some applications , the measurement naturally arises in the form of a distribution .",
    "this includes ( i ) * process industry applications * like measurement made at the wet end of papermaking machines @xcite that involves the fibre length and filler size distribution sensed via vision sensors , ( ii ) * nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy and imaging ( mri ) applications * where the measurement variable is magnetization distribution @xcite , ( iii ) * neuroscience applications * where the measurement variable is the distribution of frequency across a collection of neurons @xcite , and ( iv ) * social systems * where the measurement variable could be an ensemble of crowd @xcite sensed via cameras or motion detectors .",
    "notice that for ( i ) and ( iii ) , distributional measurement is a design choice ; for ( ii ) it is motivated by technological limitations of sensing individual magnetization states where the number of states are of the order of avogadro number @xmath32 ; and for ( iv ) individual measurement may raise privacy concerns .      density based model validation provides natural advantages over moment based or set containment methods for the following reasons .",
    "moment based methods can be erroneous for nonlinear non - gaussian systems , as two different trajectory densities may provide the same correlation information .",
    "this can be circumvented by including higher order moments , but it is not computationally tractable for high dimensional systems .",
    "set containment arguments can also be erroneous as it is possible that at a given time , two systems have trajectory densities with identical supports but different concentrations ( fig .",
    "[ intuition1 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "a proposed model is validated , if the  distance \" between its predicted density and the measured density , remains below a user - specified tolerance level , which need not be fixed over time .",
    "for example , take - off and landing are critical operational segments during the flight of a commercial aircraft , and it s unacceptable to have a controller that does not guarantee the robust performance for these critical time - segments with very high probability .",
    "this motivates the computation of probability of validation as part of the model validation oracle .          in this section ,",
    "we formalize the ideas presented above .",
    "[ intuition1 ] and [ blockdiagram ] show the outline of the model validation framework proposed here . in this formulation ,",
    "the systems under comparison are excited with a _ known _ input signal @xmath33 , and an initial pdf @xmath34 , supported over the extended state space @xmath35 , where the states @xmath36 , and the parameters @xmath37 .",
    "given the pdf @xmath38 supported over the true output space @xmath39 , and a candidate model , we compute and then compare the model predicted output pdf @xmath40 , with @xmath38 at each instances of measurement availability @xmath41 .",
    "thus , one can think of three distinct steps of such a model validation framework .",
    "these are :    1 .   evolving @xmath34 using the proposed model , to compute @xmath40 , 2 .   measuring an appropriate notion of distance , denoted as @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ blockdiagram ] , between @xmath38 and @xmath40 at @xmath41 , 3 .",
    "probabilistic quantification of provably correct inference in this framework and providing sample complexity bounds for the same .",
    "now we will elicit each of these steps .",
    "consider the continuous - time nonlinear model with state dynamics given by the ode @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the state vector , @xmath45 is the parameter vector , the dynamics @xmath46 @xmath47 , and is at least locally lipschitz .",
    "it can be put in an extended state space form @xmath48 the output equation can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the output vector . if uncertainties in the initial conditions @xmath51 and parameters @xmath52 are specified by the initial joint pdf @xmath53 , then the evolution of uncertainties subject to the dynamics ( [ extendedstatespace ] ) , can be described by evolving the joint pdf @xmath54 over the extended state space .",
    "such spatio - temporal evolution of @xmath54 is governed by the _ stochastic liouville equation _ ( sle ) given by ( section 7.6 in @xcite ) @xmath55 which is a quasi - linear partial differential equation ( pde ) , first order in both space and time .",
    "notice that , the spatial operator @xmath56 is a drift operator @xmath57 that describes the _ advection _ of the pdf in extended state space .",
    "the output pdf @xmath58 can be computed from the state pdf as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the @xmath61^th^ root of the inverse transformation of ( [ outputdynamics ] ) with @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the jacobian of this inverse transformation .",

    "thus @xmath73 with @xmath74 , being the noise strength .",
    "the output map is still assumed to be given by ( [ outputdynamics ] ) .",
    "in such a setting , the evolution of the state pdf @xmath54 subject to ( [ itosde ] ) , is governed by the _ fokker - planck equation _ ( fpe ) , also known as _",

    "@xmath75 which is a homogeneous parabolic pde , second order in space and first order in time . in this case",
    ", the spatial operator @xmath76 can be written as a sum of a _ drift operator _ @xmath77 and a _ diffusion operator _ @xmath78 .",
    "the diffusion term accounts for the smearing of the pdf due to process noise .",
    "once the state pdf is computed through ( [ fokkerplanck ] ) , the output pdf can again be obtained from ( [ outputpdf ] ) .",

    "an extension of the moc approach has been proposed @xcite . for stochastic maps , discretizations for stochastic kernels ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) , can be done through cell - to - cell mapping @xcite resulting a random transition probability matrix @xcite .",
    "once the observed and model - predicted output pdfs @xmath101 and @xmath100 , are obtained , we need a metric to compare the _ shapes _ of these two pdfs at times @xmath41 , when the measurement pdf @xmath102 is available .",
    "we argue that the suitable metric for this purpose is _",
    "wasserstein distance_.      distances on the space of probability distributions @xcite , can be broadly categorized into two classes , viz .",

    "the choice of a suitable metric depends on application .",
    "following the intuitions of section 2.1 , we list the _ axiomatic requirements _ , that a model validation metric must satisfy :    1 .",
    "the notion of  distance \" must measure the _ shape difference _ between two instantaneous output pdfs .",
    "this is because a good model must emulate similar concentration of trajectories as observed in the measurement space , i.e. the respective joint pdfs @xmath101 and @xmath100 , over the time - varying output supports , must match at times whenever measurements are available",
    ". in particular , the distance must be function of _ shape difference but not of shape _",
    ", i.e. same amount of shape difference must return same magnitude of distance , irrespective of the individual shapes being compared .",
    "+ 2 .   for meaningful validation inference",
    ", the choice of distance must be a metric .",
    "+ 3 .   for a given model - data pair ,",
    "the supports of @xmath101 and @xmath100 may not match at @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "the distance must be well defined and computable under such circumstances .",
    "the computation of the distance need not require @xmath101 and @xmath100 to be represented by the same number of samples . for the purpose of model validation ,",
    "this offers practical advantages since experimental data are often expensive to gather",
    ". however , model based simulation can harness the computational resources and hence , simulation sample size is often larger than that of experimental data .",
    "the distance must be asymptotically consistent with respect to finite sample representations of the pdfs under comparison .",
    "namely , in the infinite sample limit , the empirical estimate of the distance must converge to the actual instantaneous value of the distance . for practical computation , this",
    "rate - of - convergence is required to be fast with respect to the number of samples .",
    "next , we introduce the wasserstein distance on the manifold of pdfs , which will be shown to fulfil the axiomatic requirements listed above .",

    "thus , wasserstein distance meets * r.1 * and * r.2*. also , * r.3 * and * r.4 * are satisfied since definition [ wassdefn ] does not require the supports or cardinality of the sample representations of the pdfs to be the same .",
    "this will be illustrated further in section 4.2 , when we describe the computation of @xmath126 between two scattered point clouds with probability weights . for * r.5 * , convergence of sample wasserstein estimate to its true deterministic value , will be discussed in section 4.3.1 ( theorem [ wassestimateupperbound ] ) .      commonly used information - theoretic distances like kullback - leibler divergence @xmath128 $ ] , its symmetrized version @xmath129 , are not metrics .",

    "besides these computational problems , we emphasize here that the information theoretic distances may not discriminate shapes in a geometric sense , as desired in * r.1*. we provide two counterexamples below to illustrate this point .",
