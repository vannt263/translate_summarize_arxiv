    "following the successful development of a differential calculus on certain fractals ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , it would seem natural to try to develop an analogue of the hodge - derham calculus of k - forms .",
    "in recent years there have been several approaches to this problem ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , concentrating mainly on the case @xmath3 . here",
    "we present yet another approach .",
    "the fractals we deal with may be regarded as limits of a sequence of graphs , and the calculus of functions as developed by kigami involves defining the fractal laplacian as a limit of graph laplacians , suitably renormalized .",
    "our idea is to regard k - forms on the fractal as limits of k - forms on graphs , and to define the derivative @xmath1 and @xmath2 as suitably renormalized limits of the corresponding operators on the graphs . in particular",
    ", this means understanding the relationships among these objects as we pass from one graph to the next . on the level of the fractal , we will be guided by the intuition that a k - form is an object that can be integrated over k - dimensional subjects , and the operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be defined only for k - forms that are sufficiently smooth .",
    "it is by no means obvious how to realize these intuitions in a precise theory , and there are perhaps more than one way to do this .",
    "we will concentrate on one specific fractal , the sierpinski gasket ( sg ) , which has become the ` poster child ' for kigami s class of postcritically finite ( pcf ) self - similar fractals .",
    "sg is the limit of graphs @xmath4 , shown in figure ( 1.1 ) .    from the topological point of view",
    ", sg has 1-dimensional homology generated by infinitely many independent cycles that are visible as ` upside - down ' triangles in the graphs @xmath5 .",
    "it also contains infinitely many straight line segments that are also visible as edges in the graphs .",
    "we will therefor define 0-forms on sg as functions , 1-forms as measures on the line segments , and 2-forms as measures on sg .",
    "the ` obvious ' definition of @xmath6 from 0-forms to 1-forms is @xmath7 if @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the endpoints of l. we will define the dual operator @xmath10 from 1-forms to 0-forms , which leads to a laplacian @xmath11 on 0-forms .",
    "we will show that this laplacian exactly coincides with kigami s laplacian on functions .",
    "note that ( 1.1 ) requires @xmath12 to be continuous , but also the restriction of @xmath12 to any line segment must be of bounded variation so that the restriction of @xmath13 to the line segment is in fact a measure .",
    "( finite additivity is obvious from ( 1.1 ) , but countable additivity is the issue . )",
    "we will show that the class of functions in the domain of laplacian satisfy this condition . however , it turns out that the measures @xmath13 for this class of functions are singular with respect to lebesgue measure on the line segments .",
    "there is also an ` obvious ' definition of @xmath14 from 1-forms to 2-forms , namely , @xmath15 where c denotes any cell ( the interior of a small triangle in one of the @xmath5 graphs ) . here",
    "@xmath16 consists of the oriented boundary line segment of the triangle ,",
    "so the right side of ( 1.2 ) is just the sum of @xmath17 on three edges .",
    "( to specify a measure it suffices to give its values on cells of all levels . )",
    "it is clear from ( 1.1 ) that @xmath18 .",
    "we define harmonic 1-forms as solutions to the two equations @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we may then consider the cohomology/ homology pairing @xmath21 between harmonic 1-forms @xmath22 , and homology cycles @xmath23 .",
    "we will explicitly construct a basis of harmonic 1-forms that give zero in ( 1.3 ) for all but a single homology generator @xmath23 . since this is an infinite basis",
    ", there is an issue in how to deal with the closure of the span .",
    "we are unable to give a completely satisfactory resolution of the problem .",
    "the harmonic 1-forms gives one of the three pieces of an expected hodge decomposition of 1-forms .",
    "another piece is the image under @xmath6 of the 0-forms . in this piece",
    "the laplacian is given by @xmath24 , since @xmath14 annihilates this piece of 1-forms .",
    "it is straightforward to observe that the spectrum of this portion of @xmath25 coincides with the spectrum of @xmath26 , except for the zero eigenvalue which corresponds to the constant eigenfunction that is annihilated by @xmath6 . in other words , if @xmath12 is an eigenfunction of @xmath26 , so @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , then @xmath13 is an eigenfunction of @xmath25 , so @xmath29 . for the third piece of the hodge decomposition we need to define @xmath30 as the dual of @xmath14 .",
    "this is a somewhat ambiguous problem , as it depends on what class of 2-forms ( measures ) we would like to be able to apply @xmath30 to , and what class of 1-forms we would like to get as the image . roughly speaking , @xmath31 on an edge should be some sort of a ` trace ' of the measure @xmath32 on the edge , i.e. , some renormalized limit of the measure of an @xmath33-neighborhood of the edge .",
    "we give two distinct realizations of this intuition , using different renormalizations .",
    "one allows 2-forms @xmath32 that are absolutely continuous with respect to the standard self - similar measure on sg , with continuous radon - nikodym derivative .",
    "the other allows 2-forms @xmath32 that are absolutely continuous with respect to the kusuoka measure .",
    "( these measures are mutually singular , as first shown by kusuoka . ) in both cases the laplacian @xmath34 on 2-forms and @xmath35 on the @xmath30 portion of 1-forms are just multiples of the identity .",
    "this triviality is already seen on the graph level , and can be explained by the observation that cells only intersect at vertices , not edges .",
    "every edge belongs to a unique cell , and boundaries of different cells are disjoint .",
    "this observation is valid on all pcf fractals .",
    "in other words , to get a nontrivial calculus of k - forms for @xmath36 will require going outside the realm of pcf fractals .",
    "this perhaps explains why previous works have concentrated on the @xmath3 case .",
    "we believe that our method can be implemented for fractals such as the sierpinski carpet ( sc ) , but this remains to be seen .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the theory of k - forms on graphs .",
    "this material is mainly well - known , but we give the details for the convenience of the reader , and to set the notation for the remainder of the paper . in section 3",
    "we outline the steps involved in passing from one approximating graph to the next , on the route from fractal graphs to fractals .",
    "the actual passage to the limit would seem to require a careful analysis for each example .",
    "in section 4 we study the example sg .",
    "we present all the results described above , except for the proof of the singularity of the measure @xmath13 on the line segments , which is presented in section 5 .",
    "this result is likely to be of independent interest .",
    "in section 6 we examine briefly another example , the 3-dimensional analog of the sierpinski gasket ( sg@xmath0 ) .",
    "we concentrated on what we believe to be the most interesting result , namely the explicit computation of harmonic 1-forms .",
    "we believe that similar results should be valid for many other pcf fractals .",
    "let @xmath37 be a finite connected graph with @xmath38 and @xmath39 the collections of its vertices and edges , respectively .",
    "for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 means @xmath43 is one of the vertices of @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , if we take @xmath46 to be the collection of complete @xmath47 subgraphs of @xmath37 , then we obtain a hierarchy @xmath48 of subgraphs . for @xmath49 and @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath51 means the vertices of @xmath52 are all vertices of @xmath53 .",
    "more generally , we may choose a set of model connected graphs @xmath54 with @xmath55 being a single vertex and @xmath56 being two vertices connected by an edge , and define @xmath46 to be a collection of subgraphs of @xmath37 isomorphic to @xmath57 ( but not necessarily all of them ) .",
    "recall that a subgraph consists of a certain subset of the vertices with all the edges in @xmath37 connecting them , that is , we are not allowed to throw away edges to obtain an isomorphism . to have a nontrivial theory we require that @xmath57 is isomorphic to a subgraph of @xmath58 , and that each vertex in @xmath37 lies in some @xmath59 for every @xmath60 .",
    "we will also assume that for every @xmath49 there exist @xmath61 ( unless @xmath62 ) and @xmath50 ( unless @xmath63 ) such that @xmath64 .",
    "for example , if @xmath37 is an approximate sierpinski gasket graph , @xmath65 is the complete 3-graph .",
    "if @xmath37 is an approximate graph to the n - dimensional sierpinski gasket , @xmath66 is the complete ( k+1)-graph for all @xmath67 . for a different type of example ,",
    "let @xmath37 be a subgraph of the square lattice and take @xmath65 to be the 4-loop .",
    "a parity function @xmath68 is a function , defined for all @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xmath69 , taking values in @xmath70 and satisfying : @xmath71and @xmath72 for all @xmath73 .",
    "for example , assign orientations to all subgraphs in all @xmath46 s and define @xmath74 if the orientations of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are consistent , and @xmath75 if their orientations are inconsistent .",
    "then the sum in ( 2.2 ) contains exactly 2 nonzero terms with values @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",

    "then ( 2.21 ) says @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are endpoints of the path , which gives us a form of the fundamental theorem of calculus . similarly ( 2.22 ) says @xmath163if @xmath23 is a closed path .",

    "we discuss some general strategy for this before we work on specific examples in later sections .",
    "kigami @xcite has introduced a family of fractals , post - critically finite ( pcf ) self - similar fractals , that can be realized as attractors of some iterated function systems ( ifs ) , say , @xmath185 on euclidean spaces ( the ambient space plays no role in the theory and is introduced to simplify the discussion ) .",

    "now for such a pcf fractal we have a natural sequence of graph approximations .",

    "let @xmath201 , the images of the boundary points under the mappings in the ifs .",

    "iterating this procedure we obtain a sequence of graphs @xmath206 with sets of vertices @xmath207 then the subgraphs @xmath208 of @xmath209 @xmath210 are cells of level m. note that vertices in @xmath211 are all points in the actual fractal and @xmath212 is dense in @xmath183 in the natural topology .",
    "now we choose model graphs @xmath213 and define @xmath214 to be a collection of subgraphs of @xmath200 isomorphic to @xmath57 . for each @xmath196 , let @xmath215 be the union of images of @xmath216 for @xmath193 .",
    "each graph in @xmath215 then belongs to a single m - cell in @xmath5 for @xmath88 but vertices in @xmath217 might belong to several cells due to identification .",
    "once a function @xmath218 is defined on @xmath200 satisfying ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) , it can be transported to @xmath5 s in a natural way , and ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) still hold .",
    "similarly given a set of weights @xmath219 on @xmath214 and a collection of positive numbers @xmath220 , we can define a set of weights on @xmath215 via : @xmath221 if @xmath222 with @xmath193 and @xmath88 , and @xmath223 if @xmath62 , where @xmath224 .    in this way a sequence of laplacians and derham complexes can be defined as in section 1 .",
    "the problem is to relate the structures when @xmath196 varies and to pass to a limit when @xmath225 .",
    "we deal with this on a case - by - case basis .",
    "kigami @xcite defined a notion of regular harmonic structure on pcf fractals , which is closely related to our setup and especially to the weights @xmath123 . recall that energy on @xmath200 is given by @xmath226where @xmath227 $ ] , for pairs of functions @xmath228 on @xmath229 . with ( 3.3 )",
    "this extends to energies @xmath230 on @xmath5 via @xmath231    note that a function @xmath232 on @xmath233 can be extended to @xmath234 on @xmath235 in many ways .",
    "the extension @xmath236 that minimizes @xmath237 is called the harmonic extension of @xmath232 . to have a harmonic structure we require @xmath238 and",
    "the structure is regular if @xmath239 for all @xmath240 .",
    "there is a rather large literature on harmonic structures ( see for example [ sa ] , [ cs ] , [ p ] ) .",
    "fix a regular harmonic structure .",
    "we obtain the energy @xmath241 on @xmath183 by @xmath242 the limit always exists because @xmath243 is an increasing sequence .",
    "define @xmath244 to be the collection of functions such that @xmath245 .",
    "such functions are always continuous and hence the restriction to the dense set @xmath246 determines the function .",
    "define the quadratic form on @xmath244 by @xmath247only constant functions have zero energy and the space @xmath244 modulo constants is a hilbert space with the energy inner product .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "we may also use the weights @xmath122 to define a measure on @xmath183 as the weak limit of @xmath248to obtain a probability measure we need @xmath249and @xmath250 we denote this measure also by @xmath122 and note that @xmath251 so the measure does not depend on the initial distribution of weights on @xmath187 .",
    "now since the discrete laplacians @xmath252 on @xmath5 is given by ( see ( 2.16 ) ) @xmath253\\in e_1^m}\\frac{\\mu_1^m([x , y])}{\\mu_0^m(x)}(f_0^m(x)-f_0^m(y))\\ ] ] we might define a laplacian @xmath26 on @xmath183 by @xmath254and define @xmath255 to be the space of functions such that the above limit exists uniformly for all points in @xmath256 .    or",
    "equivalently , we can define @xmath26 by the weak formulation @xmath257 for all @xmath258 with @xmath259 .",
    "thus we see that the laplacians defined by kigami is equivalent to the derham laplacian on 0-forms .",
    "in particular the harmonic 0-forms are constants .",
    "higher order forms will be discussed in later sections . however , the fact that @xmath260 for @xmath88 lies in a single m - cell implies that @xmath261 is a multiple of the identity , and so any limit , @xmath106 , we might obtain is again a multiple of the identity .",
    "thus in pcf cases , only the theory of 0-forms and 1-forms is nontrivial .",
    "the sierpinski gasket can be realized in the plane as the attractor of the ifs @xmath262 where @xmath263 are vertices of a regular triangle .",

    "such renormalization for @xmath122 and @xmath275 makes them measures on @xmath217 and m - cells , respectively .",
    "they both converge to the standard probability measure on the sierpinski gasket .",
    "@xmath123 is renormalized to give the energy on the gasket .",
    "now suppose @xmath12 is a continuous function ( a 0-form ) on sg ; restriction of @xmath12 to @xmath217 gives a 0-form on @xmath5 .",
    "the inner product@xmath276is the same as the limit of inner product on graphs",
    ".    next we define 1-forms on sg in such a way that the restriction to @xmath277 gives a 1-form on @xmath5 ( note that edges in @xmath277 are oriented curves in sg ) . to do this , consider the vector space of @xmath278 , where @xmath279 and @xmath280 .",
    "we define 1-forms to be elements in the dual space subject to the consistency condition : @xmath281 for all @xmath282 .",

    "being continuous means the measure is continuous when restricted to each edge .",
    "this is too large a class of functions to yield an interesting theory .",
    "recall that in section 3 we defined a space @xmath244 to be the collection of functions such that @xmath245 , where @xmath241 is defined ( see ( 3.7 ) ) , with our choice of weights , by @xmath285 or , equivalently , in terms of the inner product for 1-foms , @xmath286we can define @xmath287 note that the right - hand side of ( 4.5 ) is always nondecreasing thus we might replace @xmath288 with @xmath289 . however , this is not true for general 1-forms .",
    "also , technical problems concerning convergence arise if we would like to interpret ( 4.6 ) as a quadratic form associated with an inner product @xmath290 .",
    "but @xmath291 is associated with the quadratic form @xmath292 since @xmath293 satisfies the following estimate of h@xmath294lder type : @xmath295 later we show @xmath296 implies that the restriction of @xmath12 to edges is of bounded variation and hence @xmath13 gives a finite measure .",

    "for any nonboundary point in the dense set @xmath302 , the expression ( 4.9 ) makes sense for @xmath196 sufficiently large , so @xmath303 may be defined as the limit of ( 4.9 ) as @xmath225 .",
    "we would like , for a certain class of 1-forms , to have this limit exists uniformly and the limit to be continuous so as to be extended to a continuous function on sg . for 1-forms of the form @xmath13 where @xmath293 , in particular , we have @xmath304\\in e_1^m}(f_0(x)-f_0(y))=-\\delta_0^m f^m_0(x)\\]]here @xmath305 is both the graph laplacian on @xmath5 and the m - level approximation for the kigami laplacian on sg .",
    "thus @xmath306 if and only if ( 4.10 ) converges uniformly to a continuous function on sg .",
    "so @xmath307 is a space on which @xmath10 is well - defined and @xmath308 .",
    "since the laplacian for 0-forms in @xmath309 agrees with the kigami laplacian , they have the same eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . moreover , if @xmath310 for some @xmath28 , then @xmath311 implies that @xmath13 is an eigenvector of @xmath25 with eigenvalue @xmath175 .",
    "that is , the entire spectrum of @xmath26 is replicated on the level of 1-form , with the exception of the zero eigenvalue .",
    "next we give a description of harmonic 1-forms @xmath312 on graphs @xmath5 .",
    "in particular we want to see how @xmath312 changes when @xmath196 varies and as @xmath225 .",
    "first note that there is no nontrivial harmonic 1-form on @xmath200 , since the condition @xmath313 says the sum of @xmath314 over the three edges is 0 , and @xmath315 says @xmath314 takes the same value on each edge .",
    "on @xmath202 , we have nine equations , three of the form @xmath316 and six of the form @xmath317 but there is redundancy since @xmath318thus we have a 1-dimensional @xmath319",

    "direct computation verifies that @xmath320 is harmonic .",
    "we can also understand this 1-form as locally @xmath321 where @xmath322 is a harmonic 0-form as in figure ( 4.2 ) :    note that @xmath322 is not a well - defined function since it has ambiguous values at the bottom middle vertex .",
    "but one can consider @xmath322 as a harmonic mapping from @xmath202 to @xmath323 @xcite .",
    "locally @xmath324 gives @xmath325and@xmath326    we can also use the local equality to define an extension to @xmath327 , satisfying the extension property @xmath328 we first extend harmonically @xmath322 to @xmath329 ( figure ( 4.3 ) ) and compute @xmath330 ( figure ( 4.4 ) ) .",
    "more generally , we can define a local harmonic extension algorithm on any level and any cell .",
    "suppose @xmath297 has values @xmath331 and @xmath332 on the three edges of an m - cell .",

    "we can now explicitly describe a basis for @xmath312",
    ". there will be one basic element associated to each k - cell in @xmath5 for each @xmath345 .",
    "we take the original harmonic 1-form @xmath22 and miniaturize to the cell and then extend harmonically .",
    "if the cell is @xmath346 ( @xmath347 ) , then @xmath348 is a harmonic 1-form on @xmath349 .",
    "the only nontrivial property to check is @xmath350 on @xmath351 but there @xmath352 .",
    "we then extend by the harmonic extension algorithm to a harmonic 1-form on @xmath5 . in this way we obtain",
    "@xmath353 harmonic 1-forms .",
    "this equals the dimension of @xmath312 since @xmath354 is the dimension of @xmath355 , and there are @xmath356 equations for @xmath333 , @xmath357 equations for @xmath358 with one redundancy .",
    "therefore it suffices to check the linear independence for the harmonic 1-forms .",
    "actually we will show that they are orthogonal with respect to the inner product @xmath359 .",
    "@xmath360 if @xmath361 .",
    "if the cells associated with @xmath362 and @xmath363 are disjoint then the two 1-forms are trivially orthogonal since they have disjoint support .",
    "thus we might as well assume the @xmath362 cell is contained in the @xmath363 cell with @xmath347 .",
    "first we claim @xmath364 . in this case",
    "there are only nine edges in @xmath365 on which @xmath366 is nonzero , the three inner edges , where @xmath367 and the six outer edges where @xmath368 .",
    "then it suffices to show that the contributions to the inner product from each of these two types of edges is separately 0 . for this",
    "it suffices to show that the sum of @xmath369 over each type of edges vanishes .",
    "the sum over the six outer edges is exactly @xmath370 , which vanishes .",
    "but the sum over the three inner edges is the difference between the sum of @xmath371 on each of the three ( k+1)-cells that comprise the k - cell , and @xmath370 on the k - cell , yielding @xmath372 .    to complete the proof it suffices to show that orthogonality is inherited by harmonic extensions .",
    "in fact we will show @xmath373 for any harmonic 1-forms @xmath374 and their harmonic extensions @xmath375 .",
    "we compute the contribution to the inner product from each k - cell , which is @xmath376    it is perhaps more natural to describe a basis of harmonic 1-forms in terms of integrals over 1-cycles that give a basis for homology up to a level @xmath196 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath23 the central nontrivial cycle in @xmath56 ( the upside - down triangle ) , then the homology basis consists of 1-cycles @xmath377 for @xmath378 .    for any @xmath362 and @xmath363 , @xmath379    for fixed @xmath363 the condition @xmath380 occurs exactly when @xmath381 for @xmath382 , and @xmath383 for @xmath384 .",
    "in particular for fixed @xmath362 , the integral is zero for all @xmath363 such that @xmath385 and the integral is nonzero for at most 4 choices of @xmath363 .    from the harmonic extension algorithm it is clear that for any harmonic 1-form @xmath386 ( the minus sign comes from reversed orientation ) .    for the original harmonic 1-form we have @xmath387 for any nonempty word @xmath363 , which is exactly the condition @xmath388 , while @xmath389 by inspection .",
    "this verifies ( 4.16 ) for @xmath390.more generally , we can localize this argument to obtain the first and third line of ( 4.16 ) for any @xmath362 .",
    "if @xmath391 the we can only get a nonzero integral if @xmath380 , in which case the edge of @xmath392 that meets @xmath393 contributes @xmath394 to the integral over @xmath393 , and elsewhere on @xmath393 , @xmath366 is zero . since , for fixed @xmath362",
    ", @xmath392 has only three edges , there are at most three choices of @xmath363 where we get integral @xmath394 ( we have fewer choices if some of the edges of @xmath392 lie on @xmath395 ) . on the other hand , if we fix @xmath363 , then @xmath396 can intersect @xmath393 only if @xmath397 , so we must have @xmath398 for @xmath399 .",
    "we can then allow any choice of @xmath400 , after which we can never choose that symbol again .    using ( 4.16 )",
    "it is easy to set up an inductive procedure to produce a new basis @xmath401 of harmonic 1-forms that satisfies @xmath402 then@xmath403 produces a harmonic 1-form with @xmath404 for any values @xmath405 , only finite of which are nonzero .",
    "this implements the homology/ cohomology duality between harmonic 1-forms and 1-chains at finite levels .",
    "next we consider passing to the limit to obtain 1-forms on sg .",
    "it is clear that the harmonic extension algorithm may be used infinitely often to obtain the values on all edges in @xmath406 for 1-forms .",
    "we claim then on each edge we have a finite measure .",
    "since each of the harmonic 1-forms is locally @xmath13 for some harmonic function @xmath12 , this is equivalent to the statement that the restriction of a harmonic function to an edge is of bounded variation .",
    "but in @xcite it is shown that the restriction of a harmonic function to an edge is either monotonic , or has a single maximum or minimum , and monotonic functions are of bounded variation .",
    "we also observed that @xmath407 is finite .",
    "however , if we only assume @xmath12 has finite energy then we can not conclude @xmath13 restricted to an edge is a measure .",
    "in other words , the restriction of @xmath12 to an edge may not be of bounded variation .",
    "for example , consider @xmath234 that vanishes everywhere except on a boundary edge , where it oscillates between @xmath408 .",
    "then @xmath409 and harmonic extension of @xmath12 will have energy no larger than 4 .",
    "but the variation of @xmath234 along the boundary edge is at least @xmath410 .",
    "so there is no estimate of total variation in terms of energy .",
    "it is then a routine matter to produce a counterexample by taking an appropriate infinite series of localization of these functions .",
    "assume @xmath296 , then the restriction of @xmath12 to any edge is of bounded variation , thus @xmath13 is a 1-form ( its restriction to every edge is a measure ) .",
    "we have already observed that the statement is true of harmonic functions . by localization it suffices to prove this for one of the boundary edges in @xmath266 . by subtracting a harmonic function",
    "we may reduce this to the case where @xmath12 vanishes at the boundary vertices .",
    "then we may write @xmath411 where @xmath37 is the green s function .",
    "thus it suffices to show the restriction of @xmath412 to the boundary edges for each @xmath413 is of bounded variation with total variation bounded by a constant independent of @xmath413 .",
    "this follows from kigami s formula : @xmath414 where @xmath415 is an explicit function that is piecewise harmonic at level 1 .",
    "the key observation is that for each fixed @xmath413 there is at most one @xmath362 with @xmath193 for which @xmath416 is not identically zero for all @xmath417 along a fixed boundary edge . since @xmath415 is piecewise harmonic , its restrictions are of bounded variation and the variation does not change when we localize .",
    "thus we get an estimate of @xmath418 for the variation of the restrictions , which is independent of @xmath413 .",
    "in fact the argument works if we only assume @xmath419 exists in @xmath420 or @xmath421 .",
    "a more challenging problem is to find the largest space between @xmath422 and @xmath309 that yields the same conclusion .    in section 5",
    "we will show that the restrictions of nonconstant harmonic functions are not absolutely continuous , thus the measures @xmath13 on edges are singular with respect to the arc length measure .",
    "another important question is under what conditions we can allow an infinite series in ( 4.18 ) .",
    "it is simpler to consider the series @xmath423 since the condition @xmath424 is natural if we want @xmath425 but again we an show that ( 4.23 ) is not sufficient to make ( 4.22 ) converge on edges . to see this ,",
    "consider a finite sum with @xmath426 for @xmath193 with all @xmath427 or @xmath428 and @xmath429 otherwise .",
    "since there are @xmath430 nonzero values we see ( 4.23 ) is @xmath431 .",
    "however , if we choose @xmath44 to be the bottom boundary edge then @xmath432 .",
    "next we discuss a theory of 2-forms on sg and the mappings @xmath14 from 1-forms to 2-forms and @xmath30 from 2-forms to 1-forms .",
    "the space of 2-forms will just be the space of finite signed measures on sg , but of course this is too large a space , and we want to identify a space of ` smooth ' measures for which @xmath30 may be defined as a ` trace on line segments ' .",
    "let @xmath433 denote the standard balanced measure on sg , so @xmath433 assigns @xmath434 to each m - cell .",
    "if @xmath435 is a continuous function on sg then @xmath436 is a measure absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath433 with continuous radon - nykodim derivative .",
    "we could allow a somewhat larger class of radon - nykodim derivatives , but for now this will suffice .",
    "if @xmath437 is any edge of level m , then @xmath438 is well - defined , and in fact@xmath439 which is a renormalized limit of the measure of a ` thickening ' @xmath440 of @xmath437 .",
    "note that with this definition there are no nonzero harmonic 2-forms .",
    "the corresponding definition for @xmath14 is @xmath441 but the issue is what the space of 1-forms should be admissible in this definition .",
    "note that if @xmath442 then the sums on the right - hand side of ( 4.26 ) are always zero , so the limit exists ( regardless of the renormalizing factor ) , and we have @xmath443 and @xmath444 for harmonic 1-forms . on the other hand , if we assume that @xmath445 for some continuous function @xmath435 , then @xmath446 exists and @xmath447 the factor 3 arises because each cell @xmath448 has 3 edges @xmath437 contained in it .",
    "so this yields the relatively trivial result that @xmath449 , and @xmath450 restricted to this class of 1-forms is also @xmath451 .",
    "we conclude this section by introducing an alternative approach .",
    "choose a finite measure @xmath452 on sg .",
    "in place of the inner product ( 4.2 ) on 0-forms we consider @xmath453 this does not change the definition of @xmath6 , but it will change the definition of @xmath10 . in place of the weight @xmath454 defined in ( 4.1 )",
    "we use @xmath455 where @xmath456 denotes the piecewise harmonic spline on level m that assumes the value 1 at @xmath457 and the value 0 at all other @xmath217 vertices",
    ". then in place of ( 4.9 ) we have @xmath458 thus @xmath459 when the limit exists , and @xmath460 .",
    "the point is that we can identify @xmath461 with kigami s definition ( @xcite,@xcite ) of @xmath462 , namely , @xmath463 this does not change the definition of harmonic 1-forms , as they will also have @xmath464 for large enough m.    we would next want to consider the subspace of 2-forms of the form @xmath465 for continuous functions @xmath435 .",
    "we would then need to replace the renormalization coefficients in ( 4.25 ) and ( 4.26 ) to yield the appropriate notion of ` trace on the line segments ' for the measures @xmath465 .",
    "this of course depends on the measure @xmath452 , and we do not know how to deal with the general case .",
    "what we can do is to describe the case of the kusuoka measure . for any harmonic function @xmath22 ,",
    "define the energy measure @xmath466 by @xmath467 the energy of @xmath22 restricted to @xmath152 ( it is obvious how to do the restriction when @xmath152 is a union of cells and this suffices for the definition of the measure ) .",
    "the kusuoka measure @xmath468 , where @xmath22 and @xmath469 is an orthonormal basis of harmonic functions modulo constants in the energy inner product ( it is easy to see that the result is independent of the choice of orthonormal basis ) .    for simplicity",
    "we look at the case where the 2-form is @xmath466 for some harmonic function @xmath22 , and @xmath470 is the line segment joining @xmath471 and @xmath472 .",
    "then we need the growth rate of @xmath473 , where @xmath474 , the union is over all words @xmath362 of length @xmath475 with @xmath427 or @xmath428 , and the sum is over all @xmath476 .",
    "now it happens that the value of @xmath477 was computed exactly in [ os ] ( based on results in [ ahs ] ) to be of the form @xmath478 where the constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 are explicitly determined by the values of @xmath22 on @xmath479.this means we want to define @xmath480 it is easy to localize the above argument to show that the limit exists if @xmath435 is continuous .",
    "what is not clear is how to characterize the space of 1-forms that we obtain , and how to define @xmath481 on this space of 1-forms .",
    "in this section we examine more closely the nature of the measures on the line segments given by 1-forms of the type studied in section 4 . the main result is that @xmath13 on a line segment for @xmath12 a nonconstant harmonic function is not absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "the same result follows immediately for harmonic 1-forms , since they are locally equal to @xmath13",
    ". it should be straightforward to extend the result to @xmath13 for @xmath306 since such functions may be well approximated by harmonic functions @xcite . a more difficult question we can not answer is whether or not the measure is completely singular with respect to lebesgue measure ( has zero absolute continuous part ) .",
    "let @xmath12 be a nonconstant harmonic function , and @xmath482 any line segment .",

    "<S> our approach is to construct k - forms and derham differential operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 for a sequence of graphs approximating the fractal , and then pass to the limit with suitable renormalization , in imitation of kigami s approach on constructing laplacians on functions . </S>",
    "<S> one of our results is that our laplacian on 0-forms is equal to kigami s laplacian on functions . </S>",
    "<S> we give explicit construction of harmonic 1-forms for our examples . </S>",
