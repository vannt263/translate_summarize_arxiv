    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons are produced in abundance in high energy hadron collisions .",
    "their large mass scale and well known fermion couplings make their production cross sections accurately calculable in perturbative qcd , and their leptonic decay modes provide distinctive experimental signatures that are relatively easy to identify , trigger on and separate from large backgrounds . in many respects",
    "vector boson production has become one of the most important `` standard candles '' in experimental hadron collider physics . at the tevatron ,",
    "measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 inclusive cross sections are routinely used to validate detector and trigger performance and stability .",
    "@xmath2 events in particular , due to their negligible backgrounds and trigger redundancy as well as precisely known mass , are the most important samples for the experimental determination of energy and momentum scales and lepton identification efficiencies .",
    "inclusive vector boson cross section measurements are necessary starting points for more detailed measurements , for example differential cross section measurements , exclusive measurements ( e.g. @xmath3 ) , measurements of rare processes ( e.g. diboson production ) and precision measurements of vector boson properties . at the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "the use of massive vector bosons as standard candles may be taken one step further with their yields being used to either compute , or provide an alternative definition of , collider integrated luminosities .    in the following sections the basic physics of vector boson production at hadron colliders",
    "is reviewed , and the relevant parameters of the cdf and d  detectors are stated .",
    "measurements of inclusive and differential production cross sections are discussed in section  [ sec : xs ] , as well as some of the particle properties that can be extracted from these measurements .",
    "asymmetry measurements in @xmath1 and @xmath0 production are presented in section  [ sec : asym ] .",
    "finally , the status of precision direct measurements of the @xmath0 boson mass and width at the tevatron is given in section  [ sec : precision ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : w_z_production_schematic ] indicates the phenomenological ingredients required for a complete description of vector boson production in hadron collisions . at leading order , a quark - antiquark pair annihilate to produce a @xmath0 or @xmath1 boson , which subsequently decays to a fermion - antifermion pair .",
    "cross sections are computed as a convolution of partial cross sections ( @xmath4 ) over parton distribution functions ( pdf s ; @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the fraction of the proton s momentum carried by quark flavor  @xmath7 ) : @xmath8    \\times   { \\rm d}\\sigma_{q\\bar{q}\\to w / z\\to l\\bar{l } } \\;\\;\\ ; { \\rm d}x_{p}\\ ; { \\rm d}x_{\\bar{p}}}\\;\\ ; .\\ ] ] the longitudinal momentum ( or rapidity ) distribution of the produced vector bosons depends directly on the pdf s . the rate and kinematic distributions of the decay fermions additionally depend on the couplings and branching ratios , as well as the mass ( @xmath9 ) and width ( @xmath10 ) , of the produced vector boson : @xmath11 \\;\\ ; , \\ ] ] where the parton - parton center of mass energy @xmath12 .",
    "qcd corrections to this process can be divided into perturbative and non - perturbative parts .",
    "perturbative corrections , either in the form of fixed higher order matrix elements or parton showers , modify the vector boson production kinematics - most notably the vector boson transverse momentum ( @xmath13 ) distributions - and give rise to final states with multiple , sometimes high-@xmath13 partons .",
    "non - perturbative effects , sometimes understood as intrinsic-@xmath14 distributions for the colliding partons , are especially important for obtaining a complete description of the low end of the vector boson @xmath13 spectra .",
    "finally , qcd corrections modify the helicity and therefore decay angular distributions of the vector bosons , a small but measurable effect that is important to take into account for precision measurements . by far the most important electroweak corrections to vector boson production and decay are those due to final state photon radiation from charged leptons , where the effect on lepton kinematics and identification is appreciable .",
    "initial state radiation from the colliding quarks and , in the case of @xmath0 production , radiation from the @xmath0 itself , are important to consider in analyses of high-@xmath13 photons produced in association with a vector boson , but have a negligible impact on more inclusive @xmath0 and @xmath1 measurements .     or @xmath1 boson , which subsequently decays , in this case to a lepton - antilepton pair .",
    "qcd effects need to be taken into account to give a full description of vector boson production kinematics , as described in the text . ]",
    "cdf and d  are general purpose @xmath15 detectors , efficiently triggering on and identifying leptonic decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons over significant regions of phase space  @xcite .",
    "a particular strength of the cdf detector is the excellent central tracking resolution @xmath16 [ @xmath17 , beam constrained ] .",
    "the central electromagnetic calorimeter has an energy resolution @xmath18 .",
    "muon chambers cover the pseudorapidity region @xmath17 and forward calorimeters cover the region out to @xmath19 , important for the accurate reconstruction of missing-@xmath20 .",
    "d  has significantly larger muon acceptance with chamber coverage and accurate momentum determination out to @xmath21 , and excellent hermeticity with calorimeter coverage out to @xmath22 .",
    "the performance of the tevatron collider continues to increase , such that at the time of this meeting is has delivered almost @xmath23  @xmath24 to each experiment .",
    "the measurements presented here are based on the first @xmath25  @xmath26 of run  ii data .",
    "the measurements of inclusive @xmath0 and @xmath1 production cross - sections in leptonic decay modes provide a benchmark for all analyses of events containing high @xmath13 leptons at the tevatron .",

    "the largest contributions to the non - luminosity systematic derive from pdf uncertainties , and residual experimental uncertainties on lepton identification efficiencies and backgrounds .",
    "interestingly , with non - luminosity systematic uncertainties of @xmath32 , and given the uncertainty on the theoretical cross section predictions of approximately @xmath33 , the cdf measurements are already providing a cross check of the integrated luminosity measured for that experiment  .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath1 leptonic cross sections can be written as : @xmath34 with the ratio of inclusive production cross sections taken from a nnlo calculation , the measurement of the @xmath1 leptonic branching ratio from lep and a standard model calculation of the @xmath0 leptonic decay partial width , a measurement of @xmath35 can therefore be interpreted as an indirect determination of the full @xmath0 decay width . the cdf @xmath27  @xmath26 analysis results in a measurement @xmath36  @xmath37 that is already comparable in precision with the world average result .",
    "analyses are currently being developed with the goal of minimizing the systematic uncertainty on the cross section ratio rather than the individual @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections , in order to further improve the indirect @xmath0 width determination .",
    "tau decay modes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons are experimentally much more challenging in many respects , including triggering , identification and separation from backgrounds .",
    "however the physics reward is significant , allowing tests of @xmath38 generation lepton universality and establishing a benchmark for many searches , most notably the search for the mssm higgs bosons .",
    "both cdf and d  have recently performed cross section measurements for @xmath39 production , where one @xmath40 decays leptonically and the other hadronically  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of the hadronic tau decay modes involves combining information from both the tracking and calorimetry , with constraints from the tau mass and decay topologies .",
    "figure  [ fig : z_tt ] shows the mass distributions from the two analyses , showing good agreement with monte carlo after applying background corrections .",
    "the corresponding cross sections :    @xmath41 [ d ; @xmath42  @xmath26 ] @xmath44 [ cdf ; @xmath28  @xmath26 ]    agree very well with measurements in the electron and muon channels . in addition",
    "cdf have a measurement of the @xmath0 production cross section in the hadronic tau decay channel using @xmath27  @xmath26 , and a corresponding determination of the ratio @xmath45 .",
    "an improved measurement of this ratio with much higher integrated luminosity will be particularly interesting to compare to measurements from lep  ii .",

    "a mass range as possible controls an important background to searches for new physics in dilepton channels .",
    "both the mass and the rapidity   is a function of energy and longitudinal momentum :   @xmath47 differential cross section @xmath48 can , with sufficient integrated luminosity , be used to constrain pdf s and test higher - order qcd .",
    "figure  [ fig : xsec_diff ] shows measured drell - yan mass ( @xmath1 boson rapidity ) differential cross sections in muon ( electron ) channels from cdf ( d ) , both with @xmath49  @xmath26 of data .",
    "the agreement with theoretical predictions , after careful unfolding of the data for smearing effects , is very good .",
    "differential cross section measurements for @xmath0 s are harder than for @xmath1 bosons , due to the incomplete kinematic reconstruction of events with neutrinos in the final state . as a first attempt",
    ", the cdf experiment has measured the cross section for @xmath0 production with forward electrons ( @xmath50 ) in @xmath51  @xmath26 of data , using silicon - only small angle tracking and with a different triggering strategy to central leptons .",
    "the ratio of central to forward @xmath0 cross sections is particularly interesting : @xmath52 the prediction for this ratio depends on the choice of pdf set : @xmath53 although not yet significant , there is clearly hope that with more data , this and other differential cross section measurements at the tevatron can yield useful inputs to global pdf fits .",
    "@xmath54    \\includegraphics[height=.32\\textwidth]{cdf_dsdm_plot_dt_znorm.png }   &    \\includegraphics[height=.32\\textwidth]{d0_dsdy_dsdy_e12f05.jpg }   \\\\ % \\mbox{\\bf ( a ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( b ) } \\end{array}$ ]",
    "in addition to cross sections , measured asymmetries are particularly useful for the extraction of underlying physics parameters such as electroweak couplings and pdf s .",
    "many systematics cancel in the measurement of asymmetries as opposed to absolute cross sections , and in certain cases ( most notably the search for @xmath55 bosons ) , hints of new or unexpected physics may first turn up as asymmetry rather than rate anomalies .",
    "the drell - yan forward - backward asymmetry compares the fractions of events for which the negatively charged lepton is produced in the forward and backward hemispheres , defined in the parton - parton center of mass system : @xmath56 the result of a recent cdf update to their published @xmath57 analysis  @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : asym ] .",
    "the structure around the @xmath1 pole , as well as the measured asymmetry at high mass where indications of new physics may first be expected to be observed , agree well with theoretical predictions . the previous analysis has also used the measured asymmetry to place constrains on the neutral current light quark couplings .",
    "although less precise , the tevatron @xmath57 data , along with data from the analysis of deep inelastic scattering at hera , do break a degeneracy in the determination of light quark couplings at lep , providing an important confirmation of the standard model .",
    "the observed @xmath0 charge asymmetry , defined with respect to the decay lepton direction , is a combined effect of both the underlying @xmath0 production asymmetry and @xmath58 decay asymmetry : @xmath59 the expected @xmath0 charge asymmetry is sensitive to the assumed pdf , in particular the @xmath60 ratio at high-@xmath6 , and benefits from increased statistics with respect to the @xmath1 rapidity measurement .",
    "important experimental issues are forward lepton identification and , crucially , well controlled charge mis - identification rates in order to correct the observed asymmetry for any dilution due to lepton charge mis - assignment .",
    "figure  [ fig : asym ] shows a recent @xmath0 charge asymmetry measurement by d  in the muon channel , where charge mis - identification rates were kept at the @xmath61 level out to muon pseudorapidities of 2 .",
    "interestingly , the measurement uncertainties are now appreciably smaller than the variation in theoretical predictions that can be generated by varying the input pdf set .",
    "this indicates that this data would already contribute additional constraining power to future global pdf fits .",
    "cdf have measured the asymmetry using electrons in a smaller dataset  @xcite .",
    "they have additionally shown that certain lepton kinematic regions are more sensitive to pdf variations than others .",
    "analyses are currently underway to fully exploit all the kinematic information available in @xmath0 events with the goal of unfolding directly back to the underlying @xmath0 production asymmetry .",

    "the precision determination of the @xmath0 mass is one of the most important measurements to be performed at the tevatron .",
    "@xmath63 is a critical input to standard model fits which can constrain the mass of the unobserved higgs boson or , subsequent to a discovery of a higgs boson , may give indications as to what lies beyond the standard model .",
    "the width of the @xmath0 is a less sensitive observable in global electroweak fits , but the direct measurement of the @xmath0 width nevertheless confirms a basic prediction of the standard model and provides a useful cross check of indirect measurements .",
    "the most precise top mass measurements at the tevatron are at the level of @xmath64 .",
    "by contrast the goal for the @xmath63 is a measurement substantially better than @xmath65 .",
    "this highlights the extremely difficult nature of this measurement , requiring exquisite understanding of @xmath0 production and decay , detector response and the effect of backgrounds .",
    "cdf have estimated that in the first @xmath66  @xmath26 of run  ii data , they will measure the @xmath0 mass with a precision of at least @xmath67  @xmath68 , better than the combined tevatron run  i uncertainty .",
    "d  have started with a direct measurement of the @xmath0 width in @xmath69  @xmath26 of run  ii data : @xmath70  @xmath37 .",
    "both experiments are finalizing new measurements of the @xmath0 mass , with an ultimate goal for run  ii of @xmath71  @xmath68 per experiment .",
    "the cdf and d  experiments have completed benchmark measurements of inclusive @xmath0 and @xmath1 production , as well as differential cross section and asymmetry measurements .",
    "these measurements are providing important information on fundamental @xmath0 and @xmath1 properties , as well as parton distribution functions and other aspects of vector boson production physics . with the basic signatures and experimental techniques involved in the measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production well understood ,",
    "attention is now focused on optimizing analyses for sensitivity to pdf s and other physics parameters of interest .",
    "all of this information is being brought to bear in the precision measurement of the @xmath0 mass in run  ii , the first results on which are expected soon .",
    "ultimately , measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production at the tevatron will be used as inputs to the accurate modeling of vector boson production at the lhc , crucial for using these processes to help commission and calibrate lhc detectors . in general , vector boson production promises to continue to be one of the most useful standard candles of hadron collider physics .",
