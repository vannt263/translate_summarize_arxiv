    "<S> hard diffractive processes , such as the diffractive production of dijets , allow the study of the interplay of small- and large - distance dynamics within qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a hard scale provides the normalization of the born term diagram , which is shown for single - diffractive dissociation in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) and for the double - diffractive process in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> these processes are respectively characterized by the existence of one and two large rapidity gaps , each of which is represented by pomeron exchange . at high energies , </S>",
    "<S> there are important contributions from unitarization effects . in the @xmath5 channel reggeon framework , these effects are described by multi - pomeron exchange diagrams , figs  1(c),(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> such diagrams lead to a strong violation of both regge and hard factorization , which were valid for the born diagrams of figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a),(b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> as has been known for a long time ( see , for example , @xcite ) , factorization does not necessarily hold for diffractive production processes ; for recent studies see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein . the suppression of the single - pomeron born cross section due to the multi - pomeron contributions depends , in general , on the particular hard process . at the tevatron energy , @xmath6  tev , the suppression is in the range 0.050.2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a computation of this effect was found to give a quantitative understanding  @xcite of the experimentally - observed suppression of the single diffractive dijet cross sections at the tevatron  @xcite as compared to the predictions based on hera results  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison relies on the partonic distributions in the pomeron determined from hera data . </S>",
    "<S> these parton densities have some uncertainty ( especially for the gluonic content of the pomeron ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , when the new fit to the h1 diffractive data  @xcite is used in the approach of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , even better agreement with the cdf tevatron data  @xcite is achieved  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> nowadays diffractive processes are attracting more attention as a way of extending the physics programme at proton colliders , including novel ways of searching for new physics ; see , for example , @xcite . clearly , the correct treatment of the screening effects is crucial for the reliability of the theoretical predictions of the cross sections for these diffractive processes . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , some tests of the mechanism of diffractive dijet production have been made @xcite , but further , model - independent , checks are highly desirable .    double - diffractive dijet production provides the attractive possibility to test factorization , in a parameter - free way , using only data from hadronic collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this allows an important consistency test of the whole approach . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a test of factorization has been performed recently by the cdf collaboration at @xmath6  tev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the data of interest are dijet production in single - diffractive dissociation ( sd ) , figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a),(c ) , and in the double - pomeron - exchange ( dp ) process , figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b),(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of the partons which collide in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a),(c ) to produce the dijet system may be taken as the effective densities f_a(x )  g_a(x ) + q_a(x ) , [ eq : effectivedensities ] since the hard subprocess is dominated by gluon @xmath5 channel exchange . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the gluon and the sum of quark , antiquark densities , and 4/9 is the appropriate colour factor . the subscript @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) or @xmath11 indicates whether the ` gluon ' belongs to the proton ( antiproton ) or the pomeron , as seen , for example , in the upper and lower parts of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) respectively .    following @xcite , we consider first the ratio of sd dijet production to non - diffractive ( nd ) dijet production . </S>",
    "<S> then , in the ratio of the cross sections ( for the same kinematical characteristics of jets , @xmath12 ) , the quantity @xmath13 cancels out , where @xmath14 is the partonic cross section to produce dijets with pseudorapidities @xmath15 , @xmath16 and transverse energies @xmath17 , @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> . moreover the two processes are measured by the same detector so , in the ratio , experimental uncertainties are reduced . allowing for the above cancellation </S>",
    "<S> , the ratio can be written in the form r_nd^sd  =  s_1 , [ eq : sigmasratio_ston ] where @xmath19 is the pomeron ` flux factor ' , @xmath20 is the fraction of the initial momentum carried by the pomeron ( experimentally @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 is the effective distribution of partons in the pomeron and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression factor @xmath24 , which , following bjorken  @xcite , is often called the survival probability , accounts for the screening effects caused by diagrams of the type shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is normalized so that @xmath25 for the born diagram of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to provide a quantitative check of the ` factorization - violating ' suppression factors , it is possible to remove , to a large extent , the uncertainties associated with the pomeron flux factor and the parton distributions and detector effects , by studying a second ratio of measured cross sections . considering the ratio of cross sections for dijet production by the double - pomeron - exchange ( dp ) and the single diffractive ( sd ) processes , we have r_sd^dp  = , [ eq : sigmasratio_dtos ] where @xmath26 is the suppression factor for the dp process ( in general @xmath27 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then the ratio of the two ratios , ( [ eq : sigmasratio_ston ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmasratio_dtos ] ) , becomes d  =  = . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : d_ratioofratios ] in the case when @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , the double ratio becomes d  =  . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : d_specialcaseratio ] if there were no multi - pomeron effects ( @xmath31 ) then @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> thus a deviation of @xmath33 from unity would signal a failure of factorization . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that , although we use regge factorization ( with the cross sections written as products of flux factors and the corresponding partonic distributions ) , the result is practically insensitive to this assumption . </S>",
    "<S> the breakdown of factorization for hard diffractive processes is naturally expected in qcd ; see , for example , @xcite .    to make a quantitative evaluation of the ratio @xmath33 we use the model predictions of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the multi - pomeron screening effects , where the suppression factors @xmath34 were calculated for a range of hard diffractive processes at the various @xmath35 ( and @xmath36 ) collider energies . for our processes at @xmath6  tev they were found to be s_1 = 0.10,s_2 = 0.05 . [ eq : suppressionfactorsat1.8 ] the difference between @xmath24 and @xmath26 is due to the difference in the impact parameter profiles for the processes of diagrams 1(a ) and 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the prediction of the model is @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> it was emphasized in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the suppression factor dependence of the suppression factor arising from qcd radiative effects ; see , for example , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the relevant cdf kinematics with @xmath38 not close to 1 , this dependence is not significant and , moreover , is essentially cancelled out in the ratio ( [ eq : d_ratioofratios ] ) . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 can depend also on @xmath39 and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> when more precise data become available , these dependences can be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the kinematical range of the cdf measurement  @xcite , the average value of @xmath24 turns out to be very close to 0.10 .    the experimental value for the double ratio obtained by the cdf collaboration  @xcite is @xmath40 , in good agreement with the theoretical prediction . </S>",
    "<S> it clearly demonstrates the presence of factorization breaking and the importance of unitarization effects due to multi - pomeron exchanges .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth commenting briefly on one aspect of the experimental determination of the ratio @xmath33  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the range of @xmath41 covered in the cdf measurements was @xmath42 , while @xmath43 was in the interval @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> it was therefore necessary to extrapolate the second ratio @xmath45 in @xmath41 to the value @xmath46 in order to have the same values of @xmath47 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d_ratioofratios ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this was done on the assumption that this ratio is independent of @xmath41 ( for a given @xmath39 ) , as was in fact seen in the data in the observed range of @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is confirmed by the model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where a detailed description of the cdf data on sd dijet production was performed . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the @xmath41-dependence , arising from the pomeron and secondary exchange contributions in the region @xmath48 , can be approximated by @xmath49 with @xmath50 . moreover , the @xmath38-dependence in the region @xmath51 is also close to @xmath52 with @xmath53 ; a behaviour which well summarizes several contributing @xmath38 behaviours  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the total dependence on @xmath38 and @xmath41 is @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for fixed @xmath39 there is no dependence on @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the approximate equality of the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 may not hold at very small @xmath41 or at much higher energies  @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that a theoretical framework , which takes into account unitarization effects due to multi - pomeron exchanges , predicts a substantial breakdown of factorization in hard diffractive processes . </S>",
    "<S> the multi - pomeron effects suppress the born cross section by _ </S>",
    "<S> different _ factors for _ different _ diffractive processes , due to the _ different _ impact parameter profiles of the various cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed a check of the factorization - violating suppression factors which depends only on _ measured _ cross sections at the tevatron , namely the cross sections for dijet production in single diffractive and double - pomeron - exchange processes . </S>",
    "<S> the prediction and the data are in good agreement </S>",
    "<S> . a detailed comparison , along the lines proposed , of forthcoming precision dijet data from the tevatron or lhc will be very informative . </S>"
