    "interferometer gravitational wave detectors have been operated around the world to open a new window for astronomy@xcite . though gravitational waves have still not been detected , upper limits for the wave signals such that from binary coalescence@xcite and from stellar core collapse@xcite have been obtained by the operations .    to search for the signals , matched filtering , which is a method with predicted waveforms ,",
    "is commonly used .",
    "for example , exponential gaussian correlator@xcite uses gaussian envelope , @xmath0-pipeline@xcite uses bi - square envelope , and coherent waveburst@xcite uses mayer wavelets .",
    "some of them are used with a variation of linear predictive coding@xcite , which was originally developed for speech recognition .",
    "matched filtering is successfully used to analyze not only the chirp signals by binary coalescence but also the burst signals by core collapse@xcite , where the waveforms caused by in - spiral binary stars are well anticipated by post - newtonian calculations , and where there are various waveforms caused by stellar core collapse@xcite depending on the models of gravitational wave emission process .    in near future , the signals will be found by the matched filtering approach .",
    "once the signals are obtained with certain signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , a method for detailed analysis of the signals is required .",
    "obtaining the characteristics of the observed waves by the detailed analysis , more efficient signal detection comes to possible .",
    "therefore , we introduce our method of signal analysis for the detailed analysis .    our method is a kind of mode analysis , in which we fit a given time series with a linear combination of nonlinear oscillators .",
    "our method with certain limitations is equivalent to fourier analysis , and without the limitations , the frequency precision and the time resolution of the frequencies are beyond those of fourier analysis .",
    "for example , we can obtain the frequency information even from a fraction of cycle data , and we can obtain the characteristics of the data without oscillation , as we show in the following sections . as our method does not require specific assumptions such like predicted waveforms , it is applicable to the general field of signal analysis .    through the analysis , we show that the waveforms of pre - bounce gravitational wave signals are characterized and categorized by an index @xmath1 , which we name `` bounce hardness '' .",
    "the index corresponds to the growth rate of the signals .    to begin with ,",
    "we introduce our method of analysis and its simple implementation .",
    "then , we apply the method to the analysis of in - spiral and burst signals without background noise , and we show that the signals are characterized by an index of bounce hardness .",
    "finally , we summarize the paper .",
    "the method we introduce here is a kind of mode analysis .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is the output of a dynamical system which we want to analyze , and suppose that we can obtain @xmath2 only as a numerical time series data .",
    "then , we fit the time series @xmath2 with a linear combination of oscillators with nonlinear oscillation .",
    "the fitting function @xmath3 is written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of oscillators and @xmath6 is the complex function of the nonlinear oscillation which is continuous and differentiable .    for a short enough time scale , the fitting function @xmath3 is approximated by a linear function",

    "@xmath11 correspond to the power / phase and the mode of the oscillation , respectively .",
    "as the approximated function @xmath12 is a linear function , we can easily fit the given time series @xmath2 with the function for @xmath9 .",
    "we show an example of the fitting : in general , the time series @xmath2 is given as a discrete time series @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the index of the time series and @xmath15 is the time interval of the sampling ; we fit the discrete time series with a linear difference equation @xmath16 d \\right\\ } g(t_0 ) = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the time shift operator such that @xmath18 and the mode of the oscillation @xmath19 is obtained by solving the linear difference equation .",
    "we introduce the following functions @xmath20 to give physical meaning that the power / phase @xmath21 , the frequency @xmath22 , and the decay / growth rate @xmath23 at time @xmath24 .    by use of the functions , the fitted function @xmath3 for @xmath9",
    "is written as @xmath25 \\left ( t - t_0 \\right ) \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the time series of the oscillating mode is written as @xmath26    we note here the relation with discrete fourier transform ( dft ) .",
    "the following settings @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of samples for the analysis , gives dft @xmath29\\ ] ] itself .",
    "therefore , it is found that our method of analysis includes traditional fourier analysis .",
    "the major characteristic of our method of analysis is that we can obtain the time series of the oscillating modes of given time series with high time resolution .",
    "each mode contains the information about frequency and decay / growth rate .",
    "in contrast , fourier analysis is a method which has fixed modes and fitting parameter @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , time / frequency resolution is limited by the number of samples for analysis , and decay / growth rates are not obtained directly .",
    "in this section , we introduce a simple implementation of our method of analysis to apply the method to the analysis of gravitational wave signals .",
    "the precision and time resolution of our method of analysis are shown through the application .",
    "we employ least - mean - square ( lms ) fitting for the analysis in this paper .",

    "we obtain @xmath33 by solving the simultaneous equations .",
    "then , the oscillating mode @xmath11 is obtained by the factorization @xmath34 d \\right\\ } .\\ ] ] we solve the simultaneous equations for @xmath35 and we obtain the time series of the oscillating mode @xmath36 .",
    "we note here that this implementation corresponds to the traditional maximum entropy method ( mem ) when @xmath5 and @xmath28 are large enough .",
    "therefore , background random noise , whose time series can not be written by a linear equation , is weeded out as the residual of the lms fitting .",
    "in addition , we notice here that we should solve exactly .",
    "it is for the reason that the traditional method of the lms fitting contains implicit periodic boundary condition to reduce computational complexity , and it gives wrong solution .",
    "in the following , we apply the above implementation to the analysis of chirp signal .",
    "we employ the chirp signal of in - spiral binary stars with mass @xmath37 and the distance 10 kpc for the analysis @xcite .",

    "we show the time series in .        as the chirp signal @xmath39 contains a single function for frequency ,",
    "we choose 2 as the number of nonlinear oscillators @xmath5 .",

    "we choose 8 as the number for the lms fitting @xmath28 , and we plot the results of the analysis in ( chirp frequency @xmath48 ) and in ( growth rate @xmath50 ) . as we employed the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    ", the number of samples for calculating @xmath48 and @xmath50 becomes 10 ( @xmath54 ) .",

    "circles are plotted every 12 ms to maintain readability .",
    "the calculated time series of frequency agrees strongly with the theoretical one .",
    "the difference between them is less than @xmath55 for @xmath56 , and is less than @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "as we assume a linear equation for a duration of 0.5 ms , the difference becomes larger approaching to the bounce .",

    "the solid line shows the theoretical time series of growth rate , and the plots by plus signs show the calculated one from time series . the trend and the values of the calculated time series of the growth rate",
    "agree fairly well with the theoretical one .",
    "the oscillations observed in the time series of calculated values come from the lms fitting . as our time width of analysis ( 0.5 ms ) is much shorter than the cycle of oscillation of the chirp signal ( @xmath595 ms ) in , the fitted value is affected by the status of the curvature of the chirp signal .",
    "we can attenuate the amplitude of the oscillations by employing large enough @xmath28 compare to the period of the oscillations of the time series .",
    "however , as we assume a linear equation for a duration of @xmath60 , it results low time resolution for tracing non - linearity .    as shown above",
    ", our method of analysis gives information about frequency and growth rate with high precision and with high time resolution .",
