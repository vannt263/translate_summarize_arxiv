    "a key element in any implementation of quantum computing @xcite is the ability to perform single qubit gates .",
    "clearly these require the ability to rotate one qubit ( spin ) while leaving the rest of the system unaffected . in many proposed implementations",
    "this is achieved using the fact that qubits are spatially localised , but in liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) systems @xcite this is not possible , and it is instead necessary to distinguish the qubits by their different resonance frequencies .",
    "thus frequency selective excitation plays a key role in nmr quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the simplest form of excitation in an nmr experiment is a short high power burst of radiofrequency radiation , known as a `` hard '' rf pulse .",
    "such a pulse will excite spins over a considerable range of frequencies : a simple ( if not entirely correct ) argument @xcite is that the frequency domain excitation profile is the fourier transform of the time domain pulse shape .",
    "frequency selective excitation could in principle be achieved by using a long low power pulse ( a `` soft '' pulse ) , but the selectivity is poor as the fourier transform of a rectangular pulse is a sinc function , which has considerable power in the wings .",
    "a better method is to use shaped pulses , instead of constant power rectangular pulses , thus producing a more desirable profile in the frequency domain @xcite .",
    "this approach has been extensively developed , both for conventional nmr experiments @xcite and for nmr quantum information processing @xcite ( note that the properties of many modern shaped pulses can not be rationalized using fourier arguments and it is frequently necessary to use numerical methods to calculate them ) . in some experiments , however , it is overcomplex . consider the case where a hard excitation pulse will only affect two qubits , for example in an nmr system which only has two spins of a particular nuclear species . in this case a much simpler scheme based on hard pulses and delays can be applied @xcite .",
    "schemes for frequency selective rotation using hard pulses are ultimately based on the `` jump and return '' solvent suppression pulse sequence @xcite , which is designed to avoid exciting signals directly resonant with the applied radiation while ( at least partially ) exciting all other spins . to see how the jump and return sequence can be modified for selective rotation , it is helpful to show how this sequence works for solvent suppression , which is effectively selective non - rotation .",
    "the jump and return sequence comprises a period of free precession sandwiched by two @xmath1 hard pulses on resonance with the solvent frequency , @xmath2 this and subsequent pulse sequences are written in nmr shorthand notation , where @xmath3 is the nutation angle in degrees and subscripts indicate the nutation axis , which for ideal pulses lies in the @xmath4-plane ; note that time runs from left to right , so that the @xmath5 pulse is applied first .",
    "we assume that the system begins in its thermal equilibrium state , with all the spins along the @xmath6-axis of the bloch sphere @xcite .",
    "the first hard pulse excites all the spins , and during the period of free precession any spins away from the solvent frequency will precess . the solvent spins",
    "do not precess in the rotating frame @xcite , and are returned to the initial state by the second pulse , but non - solvent spins that have strayed during the period of free precession are not fully returned , and hence result in some excitation ( see figure [ solventsuppression ] ) .",
    "it is easily shown that the sequence in eq .",
    "[ taujr ] is equivalent to a @xmath7 hard pulse , where @xmath8 is the precession angle during the period @xmath9 .",
    "the amount of excitation that a spin receives thus depends on the offset of the spin frequency from the pulse frequency , as for a given duration between pulses , the extent of the offset corresponds to an angle of rotation in the @xmath4-plane .",
    "a spin will be maximally excited if it has precessed @xmath1 from its initial position in the @xmath4-plane ( and therefore is completely unaffected by the second pulse ) , as shown in figure [ solventsuppression ] .",
    "there are two offsets where spins will precess @xmath1 in the @xmath4-plane ( _ i.e. _ , be maximally excited ) and these are equally distant above and below the pulse frequency .",
    "spins at these positive and negative offsets will end up along the same axis in the @xmath4-plane but pointing in opposite directions , corresponding to overall positive and negative rotations respectively .",
    "now we can return to our original situation with only two spins and consider how the jump and return sequence can be useful for selective rotation .",
    "the reference frequency is set halfway between the resonance frequencies of the two spins , so that in the rotating frame the spins will precess at equal but opposite rates , @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be written using product operator notation @xcite as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spin ",
    "spin coupling and we have assumed a weakly coupled system , where @xmath13 . the effect of weak coupling is to replace each transition frequency by a cluster of transitions , known as a multiplet , but if the width of the multiplet is narrow compared with the separation between multiplets ( which will be true for weak coupling ) then the effects of spin  spin coupling can be neglected .",
    "we also assume for the moment that the hard pulses are instantaneous , so that there is no precession during a pulse ( we will return to this assumption later ) .",
    "if we set the delay period between the pulses to @xmath14 the two spins will rotate by @xmath15 during the precession period , corresponding to the offset resulting in maximum excitation in the solvent suppression case .",
    "so far we have largely considered excitation sequences , that is sequences designed to take a spin from the @xmath6-axis into the @xmath4-plane , but these sequences can be used to perform the general rotations required for quantum computing , as the jump and return sequence can be viewed as a simple rearrangement of the composite @xmath6-pulses ( sequences designed to perform @xmath6-rotations using only @xmath4-rotations ) devised by freeman _ et al_. @xcite . in general , one can perform any rotation around the bloch sphere using rotations that are orthogonal to the desired rotation .",
    "in particular @xmath16 } \\ ; 90_{y } \\ ; \\equiv \\ ; [ \\theta_{x}\\ , , \\ , -\\theta_{x}]\\ ] ] where we use non - selective @xmath17-rotations ( hard pulses ) , to convert a contra - axial @xmath6-rotation ( an appropriate period of free precession ) into a contra - axial @xmath18-rotation .",
    "rotations with other phase angles can , of course , be achieved by changing the phases of the two outer pulses . for a selective , rather than contra - axial , @xmath4-rotation we can apply another non - selective @xmath4-rotation along the same axis as the contra - axial @xmath4-rotation @xcite , so that @xmath19 } \\ ; 90_{y } \\ ; \\frac{\\theta}{2}_{x } \\ ; \\equiv \\ ; [ \\theta_{x}\\ , , \\ , \\openone]\\ ] ] where @xmath20 indicates the identity ( do - nothing ) operation .",
    "the extra non - selective rotation will return the spin we do not wish to rotate to its initial position , and further rotate the spin we want to select . note that we halve the initial contra - axial rotation angle to compensate for the extra rotation on the selected spin .",
    "there is a small but useful improvement to the previous sequence : instead of adding a _ non - selective _ hard pulse to convert the contra - axial @xmath4-rotation into a selective @xmath4-rotation , we can apply a _ non - selective _",
    "@xmath6-rotation , that acts equally on both spins , to reset one spin , @xmath21 } \\ ; \\frac{\\theta}{2}_{+z } \\ ; 90_{y } \\ ; \\equiv \\ ; [ \\theta_x\\ , , \\ , \\openone]\\ ] ] for the spin that we wish to return to its original state , the non - selective @xmath6-rotation cancels the @xmath6-rotation due to precession .",
    "thus this spin does not , in effect , precess between hard pulses and so is returned by the second hard pulse .",
    "note that it is not actually necessary to perform the non - selective @xmath6-rotation ; instead we can simply move into a new reference frame , effectively rotating the frame rather than the spins @xcite , thus saving one pulse .",
    "equivalently , we can pass the @xmath6 rotation through the pulse sequence , so that the selective jump and return sequence ( equation [ oppandnonselzrot ] ) becomes @xmath22 } \\ ; 90_{\\phi+90-\\frac{\\theta}{2 } } \\ ; \\frac{\\theta}{2}_{+z } \\ ; \\equiv \\ ; [ \\theta_{\\phi}\\ , , \\ , \\openone]\\ ] ] where subscripts on pulses now indicate phase angles in the @xmath4-plane .",
    "each @xmath6 rotation can be passed through successive pulses until it reaches the very end of the sequence , at which point the final rotation can either be implemented using a composite @xmath6-pulse @xcite or , if the calculation ends with qubits in an eigenstate , simply be dropped . in some cases it is preferable to develop the pulse sequence as a series of independent modules , and in this case @xmath6 rotations",
    "should be moved to the end of each module and then corrected using composite pulses .",
    "these techniques can be extended to provide a wide repertoire of single qubit gates . by the combination of contra - axial @xmath6-rotations ( free precession ) and non - selective @xmath6-rotations ( frame rotations ) we can perform selective @xmath6-rotations on either spin . in this way we can selectively rotate one spin about the @xmath6-axis to perform equally long @xmath4-rotations on both spins , but around different @xmath4 axes for each spin , @xmath23 }   \\theta_{\\phi } \\left(2\\pi-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)_{-z } \\left(2\\pi-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)_{[+z ,- z ] } \\\\ \\equiv [ \\theta_\\phi   , \\theta_{\\phi + \\alpha}].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] using methods of this kind any desired combination of rotation and phase angles can be implemented .",
    "alternatively , such combinations can be constructed by using two selective pulses in succession .",
    "the jump and return sequence is the simplest member of a large family of solvent suppression sequences @xcite developed for use in conventional nmr .",
    "although jump and return does not excite signals exactly on resonance , this selectivity is not very robust , and signals only a small distance from resonance _ are _ significantly excited .",
    "a family of sequences , known as binomial solvent suppression sequences @xcite , have been developed which have much broader nulls in their excitation profiles .",
    "the best know of these sequence is usually called @xmath24 and for a @xmath25 rotation has the form @xmath26 where the pulse lengths are chosen such that @xmath27 , and @xmath14 as before ; the bars over pulse lengths in the name correspond to the changes in the pulse phases .",
    "although this sequence is in some ways related to jump and return its basic operation differs in an important way : in jump and return sequences the target spin is fully excited by the first @xmath1 pulse , while in binomial sequences the excitation builds up steadily throughout the pulse sequence .",
    "this leads to the use of a precession time @xmath28 , compared with @xmath9 in jump and return .",
    "as binomial sequences give more robust solvent suppression than jump and return , it might seem that they would also give more robust selective pulses , showing less dependence on small deviations from ideality in their implementation .",
    "there are , however , three reasons to doubt this surmise .",
    "firstly , the binomial family is designed to give robust non - excitation of the solvent signal , not robust excitation of the target spin .",
    "secondly , the binomial family is designed solely for the purpose of excitation , and it is not clear how well it will behave as a general rotor @xcite . finally the much longer evolution periods involved ( @xmath29 for @xmath24 , compared with @xmath9 for a simple jump and return sequence ) , mean that these sequences are likely to be vulnerable to errors in the value of @xmath30 , such as those arising from multiplet structure .",
    "we have investigated this question by modifying a range of binomial solvent suppression sequences to give selective excitation sequences , and then calculating propagator fidelities @xcite as a function of small errors in @xmath30 .",
    "although the detailed results are quite complex @xcite , the overall result is simple : selective excitations based on jump and return sequences are far more robust than those based on more sophisticated solvent suppression sequences . for this reason we will only consider jump and return sequences for the remainder of this paper . a fidelity plot for one particular jump and return sequence is shown in fig .  [ fidelity ] .",
    "pulse implemented using the jump and return approach of eq .",
    "[ seljrextrapulse ] as a function of the ratio @xmath31 between the actual offset frequency and its nominal value .",
    "the solid line shows the fidelity with respect to a @xmath1 pulse , while the dashed line shows the fidelity against an identity operation .",
    "these curves are given by @xmath32 $ ] respectively . ]",
    "although jump and return based sequences are generally quite successful when implementing single qubit gates , there is a fundamental problem in their design .",
    "since we use the difference in resonance frequencies to generate contra - axial rotations , it is obviously impossible for our hard pulses to be perfectly on - resonance with both transitions .",
    "in general we can parameterise off - resonance effects by the off - resonance fraction @xcite , @xmath33 , where @xmath30 is the off - resonance frequency , and @xmath34 is the nutation rate induced by the rf pulse . the corresponding propagator for an @xmath18 rotation is @xmath35\\\\   & = \\begin{bmatrix }   \\cos(\\zeta)-if\\sin(\\zeta)/\\gamma&-i\\sin(\\zeta)/\\gamma\\\\ -i\\sin(\\zeta)/\\gamma&\\cos(\\zeta)+if\\sin(\\zeta)/\\gamma   \\end{bmatrix } \\end{split}\\label{offresprop}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath38 this reduces to the simple form @xmath39 as expected . when @xmath40 a pulse will induce a rotation around an axis tilted away from the @xmath4-plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ offres90 ] . however , the undesired effect of rotating around this tilted axis is a systematic error and can be compensated for by various means , including composite pulses .",
    "excitation pulse for off - resonance fractions @xmath41 in the range 0 to 1 in steps of @xmath42 . ]",
    "the use of composite pulses to correct for off - resonance errors has been widely studied in conventional nmr @xcite .",
    "more recently , corrective composite pulses that act as general rotors , known as class - a composite pulses @xcite , have been developed for conventional nmr experiments @xcite and for nmr quantum computing @xcite . for a system with just two spins , with",
    "equal and opposite known resonance offsets , there is an analytical solution for a composite pulse that perfectly corrects the off - resonance error .",
    "this rotten ( resonance offset tailoring to enhance nutations ) composite pulse @xcite consists of a time symmetric sequence of three hard pulses , that carries out the desired @xmath4-rotation on both spins .",
    "the fidelity of the desired rotation at the actual resonance offset of both spins is unity , since the rotten composite pulse sequence is tailored to perform perfectly for this resonance offset .",
    "although it is possible to combine the three period rotten sequence with the jump and return approach , a simpler sequence results if two of the rf pulses are converted to @xmath6-rotations . a helpful insight into how this new sequence works is provided by an existing result from conventional nmr .",
    "it is well known that a @xmath1 pulse with a small off - resonance fraction @xmath41 applied to an initial @xmath6-state ( usually called an excitation pulse ) is , to a good approximation , equivalent to an ideal @xmath1 hard pulse followed by a period of free precession for a time equal to @xmath43 of the pulse length @xcite .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ offres90 ] , where the lines corresponding to small values of @xmath41 all terminate near the @xmath4-plane , and are offset from the @xmath17 axis by angles that are roughly proportional to the off - resonance fraction .",
    "the same conclusion can be reached by expanding eq .",
    "[ offresprop ] to first order in @xmath41 .",
    "this approach is not confined to excitation but can be generalized : a @xmath1 pulse can be approximated as an ideal pulse surrounded by free precession periods of length equal to @xmath44 times the pulse length .",
    "( the case of an excitation pulse , described above , is special : the initial precession period can be dropped as @xmath6-states are invariant under free precession , allowing a simpler approximation to be used . ) reversing this , it is clear that a @xmath1 pulse applied to a spin with a small off - resonance fraction @xmath41 would behave almost like an ideal pulse if it were preceded and followed by periods of length equal to @xmath45 times the pulse length ; methods for implementing _ negative _ time periods are considered below .    for larger values of @xmath41",
    "this approximation begins to break down in two ways .",
    "firstly the phase angle is no longer linear in the offset frequency , and so it is not possible to correct this using a fixed evolution time , and secondly the final state can lie some distance from the @xmath4-plane .",
    "it is , however , possible to achieve an ideal rotation for any particular off - resonance fraction in the range @xmath46 by placing negative @xmath6-rotations before and after a pulse with a nominal nutation angle greater than @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath6-rotation sandwich @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 is the nutation angle of the central pulse in the _ absence _ of off - resonance effects ) can be shown to perform an ideal @xmath49 rotation as long as the angles are chosen as @xmath50 pulses with other phase angles can , of course , be achieved by changing the phase of the central pulse . for small off - resonance fractions eq .",
    "[ z90z ] can be expanded to first order in @xmath41 , giving @xmath51 and @xmath52 . outside the range @xmath46 the angles @xmath48 and @xmath53 become imaginary , and this approach is no longer possible .",
    "this approach can also be used for two spins with equal and opposite resonance offsets ; the nutation angle @xmath48 will be the same for both spins , while the @xmath6-rotation angle @xmath53 will take equal and opposite values for the two spins ; the two spins need a period of free precession given by @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the length of the @xmath1 pulse ) to rotate in opposite directions . for small values of @xmath41 , @xmath56 as expected .",
    "the spin precession time is negative , but we can achieve this by subtracting the desired negative precession time from any neighbouring positive precession period .",
    "if no such period exists then one can be created : the two spins will precess through angles of @xmath57 during a time @xmath58 , and such time periods can be inserted with impunity . in effect",
    "this allows the spin to achieve a negative precession angle by going the long way around the bloch sphere .",
    "in fact it is not necessary to go all the way round , as a similar effect can be achieved by combining a precession period of length @xmath28 , which gives rotations of @xmath59 , with a simultaneous @xmath60 rotation , so that one spin is left alone while the other rotates through @xmath61 .",
    "the strategy of a @xmath6-rotation sandwich also works for a pulse with an arbitrary nutation angle , @xmath62 .",
    "the required rotations are now given by @xmath63)\\ ] ] and @xmath64\\cos\\theta)}{\\sqrt{1+f^2}}\\ ] ] with first order approximations @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "solutions exist for off - resonance fractions in the range @xmath67 ; note that as @xmath8 increases , the range of off - resonance frequencies which can be tolerated decreases .",
    "this is particularly obvious for a @xmath0 rotation ( a not gate ) , which can only be formed when @xmath38 , as any tilt in the rotation axis will make it impossible to rotate a state from the north pole of the bloch sphere to the south pole . at the other extreme it is possible to use @xmath6-rotation sandwiches to perform accurate @xmath68 rotations , even with off - resonance fractions greater than 20 !",
    "a solution to this problem is to implement pulses with large rotation angles as two or more pulses with smaller rotation angles .",
    "for example it is possible to implement a @xmath0 pulse by combining two @xmath1 pulses , which are themselves implemented using @xmath6-rotation sandwiches .",
    "thus @xmath69 where @xmath70 will implement a @xmath71 pulse for two spins with equal and opposite off - resonance fractions .",
    "the relationship of @xmath72 to @xmath73 and @xmath74 is analogous to that between @xmath75 , @xmath48 and @xmath53    the @xmath6-rotations at either end of the sequence are backward precession times , but it may be possible to combine these with surrounding precession periods",
    ". the range of @xmath41 values which can be tolerated will be at least doubled by this process , and for large angles the improvement will be much greater .",
    "the process can , of course , be extended indefinitely , dividing a pulse up into a very large number of smaller pulses ; the final result is similar to a dante pulse @xcite , but for such large off - resonance frequencies it is probably more sensible to use conventional shaped pulses .    for the special case of a @xmath0 pulse ( simultaneous not gates on both spins ) , the outer @xmath6-rotations can simply be dropped . in general a @xmath0 rotation refocuses equal periods of precession on either side of the pulse , so we can add periods of precession to either side and it remains a @xmath0 rotation .",
    "thus we can `` add '' periods of the right length to exactly cancel the backward @xmath6-precession periods , and the sequence @xmath76 will implement a @xmath77 pulse for two spins , and is valid for the range @xmath46 .    this sequence can be shortened by replacing the central @xmath57 evolution by a @xmath59 evolution and a @xmath0 frame rotation , to give the sequence @xmath78 where the @xmath0 frame rotation has been split into two . for the permitted range of off - resonance frequencies ( @xmath46 )",
    "the evolution period will always be greater than or equal to zero .",
    "the frame rotations can be passed through the pulses to the beginning and end of the sequence , and can then be dropped .",
    "thus the sequence @xmath79 will also implement a @xmath77 inversion pulse for two spins with @xmath46 .",
    "this approach can also be combined with conventional jump and return sequences , to perform more accurate selective or contra - axial rotations , by simply replacing each @xmath1 pulse in a sequence with a @xmath6-rotation sandwich .",
    "as usual it is possible to combine the different periods of precession to give a simpler sequence . thus using equation  [ oppandnonselzrot ] and choosing @xmath80 gives @xmath81\\ ] ] where the central evolution periods have been combined , and the @xmath82 rotation can be implemented using frame rotations .",
    "the precession times at either end of the sequence are negative times , but as before it will be possible to combine these with surrounding precession periods or , failing this , to introduce additional precession periods of @xmath58 with which they can be combined .",
    "once again it is instructive to consider the special case of a @xmath0 contra - axial rotation , when the outer @xmath6-rotations can simply be dropped as before to get @xmath83 a sequence identical to that derived previously , equation  [ eq : hard180 ] .",
    "this makes sense : a @xmath0 contra - axial rotation is indistinguishable from a @xmath0 hard rotation , as when going half way round the bloch sphere it does not matter which direction is taken .",
    "jump and return sequences provide a simple but effective way of implementing frequency selective pulses in two spin systems .",
    "they have already proved useful in nmr quantum computation , and could also be applied in related systems where implementing conventional shaped pulses is impractical .",
    "the simplest approach is only suitable when the difference in resonance frequencies is small compared with the nutation rate of the external field , but more complex approaches can be used to implement both selective and non - selective pulses in spin systems with larger off - resonance fractions .    given the power of existing shaped pulse approaches it is important to consider what advantages are offered by jump and return sequences , which can be summarized as simplicity and time - efficiency .",
    "although modern nmr spectrometers are usually capable of implementing complex shaped pulses , older equipment has much more limited capabilities , and jump and return pulses have been used to implement nmr quantum computing on such devices @xcite . more importantly electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectrometers are not yet capable of implementing complex shaped pulses , and so simpler approaches will be needed if current quantum computing experiments based on esr @xcite and electron - nuclear double resonance ( endor ) @xcite are to be extended .",
    "jump and return sequences based on equation  [ seljrextrapulse ] are particularly simple , requiring only pulses with simple phase angles and delays . finally , jump and return sequences are also time - optimal in that they are the shortest possible sequences capable of achieving selective excitation , thus minimising decoherence effects during pulses .",
