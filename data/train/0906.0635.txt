    "during the past decade , fractional calculus has attracted considerable attention from physicists and engineers .",
    "this is particularly true for researchers working in the fields of condensed matter physics , where fractional differential equations have been used to model various anomalous transport phenomena @xcite .",
    "thus one expects fractional calculus , in particular fractional differential equations , to play an important role in quantum theories of mesoscopic systems and soft condensed matter which exhibit fractal character .",
    "fractional dynamics provides a natural framework for describing the evolution of physical systems in fractal and multifractal media . by extending the above argument to quantum theories in fractal space - time",
    ", one may then have to deal with quantum mechanics and quantum field theory which satisfy fractional generalizations of schrdinger , klein - gordon and dirac equations .",
    "however , applications of fractional calculus to quantum theory are still relatively new . in quantum mechanics , fractional schrdinger equation in its various forms has been studied recently @xcite .",
    "fractional supersymmetric quantum mechanics has also been considered @xcite .",
    "fractional klein - gordon equation @xcite and fractional dirac equation @xcite have been considered more than a decade ago for various reasons . for examples ,",
    "field theory with lagrangian containing nonlocal kinetic terms involving fractional power of dalembertian operator arises in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional bosonization @xcite and also in effective field theory with some degrees of freedom integrated out in the underlying local theory @xcite .",
    "some studies have indicated that the qed radiative correction leads to a modification of the propagator of a charged dirac particle which acquires a fractional exponent connected with the fine structure constant that is a fractal propagator @xcite . in quantum field theory of gravity with asymptotic safety @xcite , spacetime geometry can not be understood in terms of a single metric .",
    "there is a need to introduce a different effective metric at each momentum scale .",
    "in addition , spacetime structure in asymptotically safe quantum einstein gravity at sub - planckian distances has been shown to be fractal @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have studied the propagation of a scalar particle in a dynamically triangulated spacetime , with a discretized version of the einstein dynamics , and found that the spectral dimension of the microscopic spacetime is two and it tends to four for long time scales @xcite .",
    "the use of differential and integral operators of fractional constant and variable orders may seem appropriate and natural for such quantum field theories in fractal and multifractal spacetime .",
    "recently , work on casimir energy associated with fractional klein - gordon field has been carried out , in particular the casimir effect associated with fractional massive and massless fields has been studied @xcite .",
    "self - interacting scalar massive and massless fractional klein - gordon fields have been considered in the context of topological symmetry breaking on toroidal spacetime @xcite . in this paper , we want to study casimir effect corresponding to fractional klein - gordon massless scalar field in the piston setting .",
    "casimir effect associated with piston geometry has attracted considerable attention since it was first introduced by cavalcanti @xcite .",
    "the geometric setup of casimir piston can be used to avoid divergence problems that usually plague the calculations of casimir effect . by taking suitable limits ,",
    "the piston approach can be used to derive the casimir force acting on two parallel plates embedded orthogonally inside an infinitely long chamber @xcite , and the casimir force acting on two infinite parallel plates @xcite .",
    "therefore it would be interesting to study the behavior of the casimir force acting on a @xmath0-dimensional rectangular piston due to fractional klein - gordon massless field . in line with our consideration with the fractional field",
    ", we also impose on the piston fractional neumann boundary condition which allows the interpolation between the ordinary neumann boundary condition and the dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "let @xmath1 , @xmath2 be a massless fractional klein - gordon field with lagrangian @xmath3where @xmath4 for the interpretation of the fractional operator @xmath5 , we refer to our previous work @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the finite temperature casimir force acting on a piston moving freely inside a rectangular cavity @xmath6\\times\\ldots\\times[0 , l_d]$ ] ( see figure [ f1 ] ) due to the fractional field @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the piston has negligible thickness and is orthogonal to the @xmath7 direction , with position given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 . on the walls of the rectangular cavity , the field @xmath1",
    "is assumed to satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath10 . on the piston , the field @xmath11 is assumed to satisfy the fractional neumann condition @xmath12the cases where @xmath13 ( dirichlet boundary condition ) and @xmath14 ( neumann boundary condition ) have been discussed in our previous work @xcite . therefore in this paper , we only consider the case where @xmath15 .",

    "the casimir free energy of the system is the sum of the casimir free energy @xmath17 inside region i @xmath18\\times[0 , l_2]\\times\\ldots\\times[0 , l_d]$ ] , the casimir free energy @xmath19 inside region ii @xmath20\\times[0,l_2]\\times\\ldots\\times[0,l_d]$ ] , and the casimir free energy @xmath21 outside the cavity @xmath22\\times\\ldots\\times[0 , l_d]$ ] , i.e. , @xmath23the casimir free energy of the exterior region @xmath21 does not give rise to casimir force on the piston . using matsubara formalism ,",

    "the casimir energy @xmath43 is then given by @xmath44we regularize this sum by exponentially cut - off method , i.e. , @xmath45where @xmath46 is a cut - off parameter with the dimension of length .",
    "for the casimir energy in region ii , one can show that it can be obtained from the casimir energy in region i by replacing @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",

    "we notice that these divergent terms are independent of the position of the piston @xmath47 and the fractional parameter @xmath54 .",
    "the last term in is what one would obtain for the casimir energy if one uses the zeta regularization method to compute the casimir energy .    upon differentiating with respect to @xmath47",
    ", we find that all the terms that diverge when @xmath53 do not contribute to the casimir force acting on the piston , since these terms are independent of @xmath47 . by taking the limit @xmath53",
    ", we find that the casimir force acting on the piston is @xmath55using the result in the appendix , we find that the casimir force can be written as the difference @xmath56where @xmath57 is the casimir force acting on the piston when the right end of the cavity is infinite distance away , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "it can also be interpreted as the casimir force acting between two parallel plates embedded inside an infinitely long rectangular cylinder , where dirichlet boundary condition is imposed on one of the plates , and fractional neumann boundary condition is imposed on the other .",
    "it should be remarked that by putting @xmath13 and @xmath14 in , we obtain respectively twice the casimir force when dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are imposed on the piston .",
    "the factor of two arises since for dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions , the @xmath59 and @xmath60 modes are dependent , but for general fractional neumann conditions with @xmath61 , the @xmath59 and @xmath60 modes are independent .    since @xmath62we can conclude from that the casimir force is always repulsive when @xmath63 . for @xmath64 , the casimir force can be attractive or repulsive depending on the values of @xmath65 and @xmath16 . however , when @xmath47 is large enough , or more precisely , when @xmath66the casimir force is always attractive .",
