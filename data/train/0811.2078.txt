    "the first investigation of the mesoscopic fermion heat capacity belongs apparently to frlich , ref .",
    "@xcite of @xmath19 , who considered a system with a single electron spectrum similar to the spherical oscillator , i.e. with equal level spacing @xmath2 and high level degenerations that was regarded as an approximation to the spectrum of a cubic rectangular potential .",
    "this model allowed frlich to establish such distinctive feature of the low temperature heat capacity ( @xmath20 ) as exponential growth with increasing temperature .",
    "he also found that at subsequent heating up to @xmath21 the specific heat gains the bulk value .",
    "the most important objection against frlich s approach was given by kubo ( summary of the investigations of kubo and his collaborators is given in refs  @xcite ) who emphasized the irregularities of level spacings in mesoscopic systems which , as it seemed untill the eighties of the past century , could not have a defined and fixed shape and size .",
    "therefore for describing an ensemble of such objects kubo introduced into consideration the probability distribution for the spacings between adjacent levels . in this case",
    "the thermodynamic quantities had to be calculated not with the spectrum of an individual system but with interlevel spacings which possess some probability of their appearance .",
    "as kubo supposed the poisson distribution in which very small spacings are most probable this immediately results in practical disappearance of the exponential part of the heat capacity and even at @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the averaged level spacing ) @xmath20 becomes linear in temperature .",
    "application of other types of the level statistics remains rapid growth of @xmath20 v.s .",
    "@xmath5 though now it is not exponential increasing but proportional to either @xmath24 or @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "however the interest in such description of mesoscopic systems has partly diminished after the discovery of the shell structure in metal clusters  @xcite and appearance of the possibility to fabricate mesoscopic systems such as artificial atoms or quantum dots with given geometry and controlled particle numbers  @xcite .",
    "electron - shell effects were also identified in experiments on diverse metal nanowires  @xcite .",
    "one more stimulus for the consideration of individual fermion systems came from experiments on trapped gases of fermions  @xcite .    therefore on this new stage in development of mesoscopic physics when variety of phenomena could be explained only if the level structure was explicitly taken into account the main interest has been concentrated on investigations of individual systems with a fixed particle number and geometry .    as any of such systems can exchange energy with surroundings",
    "it has to be treated as a canonical ensemble .",
    "for the first time an analytical formalism ( approximate in general but exact for very large particle number ) was worked out by denton , mhlschlegel and scalpino  @xcite for @xmath26-oscillator .",
    "brack et al  @xcite applied the canonical formalism ( though not in its simplest version ) to calculations of the electron heat capacity of alkali clusters with realistic single electron spectrum created by the temperature self - consistent potential .",
    "parallel with exact canonical calculations approximate methods have been developed : partial projection , refs .",
    "@xcite , saddle - point approximation , ref .",
    "@xcite , integral - transformation method , ref .  @xcite . in this chapter",
    "we apply our canonical polynomial formalism , ref .",
    "@xcite , the general idea of which is similar to that of denton et al however our method is applied to any energy level distribution and arbitrary particle numbers .",
    "though among many experiments performed on mesoscopic systems to the present time there are only several investigations of the thermal behavior and in particular the heat capacity of normal and superconducting mesoscopic systems ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) we believe that such experiments will gain greater development owing to their practical applications .",
    "therefore preliminary theoretical estimations of @xmath20 for individual systems in simplified models that we give in this chapter can be a basis for arrangements of future experiments and further theoretical improvement .",
    "our calculations of the fermion heat capacity are carried out in the independent particle model that can be directly applied only to trapped ultra - cold fermi - gases . in the majority of the electron systems the strong interaction of each electron with ion surroundings and other electrons forms fermion quasiparticles with an effective mass different from the free electron mass and an energy spectrum similar to that for free electrons in a confinement potential .",
    "as shown in the fermi liquid theory  @xcite the quasiparticle potential ( the existence of which is directly established by experiments on the observation of the shell structure ) can depend on the excitation energy and temperature that does not explicitly taken into account in our calculations - this is our first simplification .",
    "the second simplification consists in neglecting the quasiparticle damping i.e. levels are considered to be perfectly sharp .",
    "however both these simplification can affect only high temperature values of @xmath20 .",
    "besides , we do not allow for the residual electron - phonon interaction i.e. such its part which in an averaged form does not enter into the electron mean field . as known  @xcite this interaction gives rise to renormalization of sommerfeld s constant @xmath13 for bulk metals at those temperatures that lead to the linear variation of @xmath20 v.s .",
    "@xmath5 ( @xmath14 ) therefore our estimations of @xmath20 can be essentially corrected by taking into account the electron - phonon interaction in this temperature region .",
    "however as shown below at these temperatures ( when @xmath20 is proportional @xmath5 ) the heat capacity practically does not bear information concerning the level structure near the fermi energy and so we hope that the electron - phonon interaction being allowed for does not change drastically our conclusions .",
    "two types of confinement are employed in our calculations . as a hard confinement",
    "we make use of the @xmath9 and @xmath7 rectangular potentials while the harmonic oscillator potentials are regarded as a soft confinement .",
    "the realistic case is something intermediate between these potentials .",
    "this can reveal itself again in the temperature region that provides the linear variation of @xmath20 with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the finite depth of the potential can affect the high temperature variations of @xmath20 which is certainly only of academic interest in the majority of cases .",
    "the content of this chapter includes @xmath27 sections . in sec.2",
    "the basic formulae for the calculation of @xmath20 and interpretation of numerical results are given , here also the stages of the temperature evolution of @xmath20 are outlined in consecutive order .",
    "then in sec.3 - 6 we give the results corresponding to each stage .",
    "in sec.7 we present conclusions .",
    "thermodynamic properties of fermion isolated mesoscopic systems that can be described by the independent or free particle model are determined by their single - particle energy spectra depending on the type of the fermion confinement and the size of the system . for such systems",

    "however this approximation gives wrong results at @xmath46 for systems with degenerated but partially filled ( at @xmath47 ) levels and at @xmath48 for all systems .",

    "@xcite ) calculations of @xmath20 with @xmath28 and @xmath37 at low temperatures lead to different but like results . as a rule @xmath42 calculations overestimate values of @xmath20 at low @xmath5 though with increasing @xmath5 this difference disappears .",
    "however the simplicity of the basic relationship for @xmath20 in the @xmath42 method gives the unconditional advantage to the @xmath42 method over the canonical one , eqs .",
    "( [ cegce ] ) ,  ( [ phi ] ) , in interpretation of results .",

    "therefore our data are appropriate for any fermion system with the same @xmath6 , shape , temperature and the type of confinement , however representation of these data on the absolute temperature scale requires the knowledge of the absolute values of @xmath1 for each @xmath6 .",
