    "neutron diffraction on eu materials is inherently difficult because of the very strong absorption cross section of natural europium .",
    "nevertheless , magnetic structure determinations were carried out a few decades ago in single crystalline euas@xmath0 @xcite and in euco@xmath2p@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , antiferromagnetic euas@xmath0 presents a feature which was to be found in many eu intermetallics studied later : a first transition to an incommensurate phase , extending only over a few k , followed by a transition to an equal moment phase @xcite .",
    "but most of the information about the magnetic structure of eu compounds has been quite often inferred only through single crystal magnetization measurements or mssbauer spectroscopy on the isotope @xmath3eu , like in eupdsb @xcite . in the last few years , however , neutron diffraction with thermal neutrons was successfully employed to unravel the magnetic structure of some intermetallic divalent eu materials @xcite .",
    "of the two valences eu@xmath4 and eu@xmath5 , only the divalent , with a half - filled @xmath6 shell with l=0 and s=7/2 , has an intrinsic magnetic moment of 7@xmath7 .",
    "despite the quite weak anisotropy of the eu@xmath5 ion due to its vanishing orbital moment , a variety of structures was found , ranging from ferromagnetic in eufe@xmath2p@xmath2 @xcite and eu@xmath8pdmg @xcite , collinear antiferromagnetic ( af ) in eucu@xmath2sb@xmath2 @xcite to incommensurate spiral in euco@xmath2p@xmath2 @xcite and eucu@xmath2ge@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the interionic interactions are quite complex in eu intermetallics , most probably due to the oscillating character of the rkky exchange and also to the relative importance of the dipole - dipole interactions between rather large eu@xmath5 moments of 7@xmath7 . as a result",
    ", the deduction of their magnetic structure from solely macroscopic measurements is often impossible .",
    "+ in this work , we present a neutron diffraction study of single crystalline eunige@xmath0 .",
    "eunige@xmath0  was the subject of two previous studies , on a polycrystalline sample @xcite and on a single crystal @xcite .",
    "it crystallizes in a body - centered tetragonal structure ( space group @xmath9 ) and presents two magnetic transitions , at @xmath10=13.2k from the paramagnetic phase to an incommensurate moment modulated phase , then at @xmath11=10.5k to an equal moment antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase .",
    "the single crystal magnetization curve with field applied along the tetragonal * c * axis shows a particularly complex behavior at 1.8k @xcite , with two spin - flop like magnetization jumps at 2 and 3 t followed by a saturation in the field induced ferromagnetic phase at 4 t ( see fig.[squid ] ) . when the field is applied along the",
    "* a * ( * b * ) axis , the magnetization curve shows no such anomaly and reaches saturation at 6 t .",

    "magnetization curves at 1.8k in eunige@xmath0  with the field along * b * and * c * taken from ref .. the insert shows the low field part of the curve for * h * // * b * , where a dip is clearly seen.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    assuming simple af structures with propagation vectors * k * = ( 001 ) or ( @xmath12 , it was not possible to reproduce the magnetization curve along * c * using a molecular field model involving two nearest neighbor exchange constants ( along * a * and along * c * ) , the dipolar field and a weak crystal field interaction @xcite . clearly , an experimental determination of the zero field magnetic structure is needed in order to go further in the understanding of eunige@xmath0 .",
    "this was the original aim of the present work , but while exploring the in - field metamagnetic behavior of eunige@xmath0 , we have found a number of magnetic phase transitions which were not detected by macroscopic measurements . here",
    "we give the detailed description of these transitions with the field oriented along the * b * ( * a * ) and * c * directions and present a molecular field model with 4 exchange integrals which partially succeeds in reproducing both the zero field structure and the magnetization curves .",
    "details of the preparation method of the eunige@xmath0  single crystals , grown with in flux , can be found in ref .. for the neutron diffraction study , a 3x3.7x1mm@xmath13 single crystal was mounted with the * c * axis or the * b * axis vertical in the variable temperature insert of a 7.5 t split - coil cryomagnet .",
    "experiments were performed on the neutron diffractometer super-6t2 ( orphe - llb ) @xcite .",
    "scattering intensity maps were measured at @xmath14 = 0.902  ( cu monochromator and er filter ) by rotating the sample around the vertical axis with 0.1@xmath15 steps and recording the diffraction patterns with a position - sensitive detector ( psd ) .",
    "this allowed to detect all transformations of the magnetic structure under magnetic field by direct inspection of the 3d crystal reciprocal space obtained by transformation of the measured sets of psd images . for quantitative refinements and studies of the magnetic field dependence ,",
    "single ( lifting ) counter mode was used .",
    "the results were analyzed using the cambridge crystallography subroutine library(ccsl ) @xcite .",
    "+ prior to magnetic structure studies , the nuclear structure was verified in zero field at 15k .",
    "a total of 213 reflections were measured and 94 unique ones ( 74 @xmath16 3@xmath17 ) were obtained by merging equivalents , using space group @xmath9 . since eu is a strongly absorbing neutron material , the absorption corrections are of major importance in the merging procedure.they were made using the absmsf program of the ccsl which properly accounts for the crystal shape .",
    "the absorption correction was found very important , yielding an absorption coefficient @xmath18=1.05mm@xmath19 , which resulted in up to 80% reduction in the intensity of some measured reflections .",
    "absorption correction yielded an improvement of the internal factors of nuclear reflections from @xmath20 ( without corrections ) to @xmath21 and it was applied to all measured magnetic data sets .",
    "the nuclear structure parameters obtained in the refinement were found in agreement with those published earlier @xcite , with lattice parameters @xmath22  and @xmath23 .",
    "extinction corrections were applied using the extcal program of the ccsl , which takes into account the crystal shape .",
    "the extinction parameters and the scale factor obtained in the refinement of the nuclear structure were used as input in further magnetic structure refinements .",
    "the zero field magnetic structure of eunige@xmath0  was first studied using a psd .",
    "figure [ tdep_slice ] shows a bidimensional ( h k 0 ) intensity cut in the reciprocal space at 1.6k .",
    "apart from the nuclear reflections being located at integer positions , there are additional satellites which can be assigned to an antiferromagnetic contribution .",
    "eight magnetic satellites can be distinguished around ( 1  1  0 ) and indexed using a * k*=(@xmath24 @xmath25 0 ) propagation vector , with @xmath26=0.05 , and its tetragonal permutations . in the following , the four possible * k * domains are labelled * k*@xmath27=@xmath24 ( @xmath26 0 ) , * k*@xmath2=@xmath24 ( -@xmath26 0 ) , * k*@xmath0=@xmath24(@xmath26 0 ) and * k*@xmath8=@xmath24(-@xmath26 0 ) .",
    "these satellites form a star of the @xmath9 space group and correspond to a rather complex antiferromagnetic structure with a very large unit cell , whose details are discussed below .",

    "the value @xmath290.05 remains unchanged up to about 11k , and undergoes a small shift to 0.066 at 12k , as clearly seen on fig.[t_inc ] .",
    "figure [ slice_delta ] top shows that , up to 12k , the thermal variation of the scattering intensity can be well fitted to the s=7/2 mean field function adequate for eu@xmath5 ions , with a molecular field constant @xmath305.95t/@xmath7 .",
    "such a fit gives an excellent agreement between calculated and experimental data , with a transition temperature t@xmath3112.0k .",
    "above 11k , the ( 1+@xmath26  @xmath28  1 ) satellite intensity deviates from the mean field function , and vanishes above 13.5k .",
    "in this temperature range , the observed small shift of the @xmath26 value corresponds to the intermediate phase reported in the mssbauer investigation @xcite , which shows an incommensurate modulation of eu moments .",

    "we monitored the scattering intensity of the ( 1  0  1 ) reflection for * h * // * c * as a function of field .",
    "this reflection contains both nuclear and magnetic contributions , the magnetic one being proportional to the square of the induced magnetization .",

    "is observed , with two well defined jumps at respectively 2 and 3 t , followed by the spin - flip transition at h@xmath33 4 t with the fully saturated eu@xmath5 moment of 7@xmath7 .",
    "the top panel of figure [ sweep ] shows the scattering intensity along the (  @xmath26  0 ) direction at 1.6k for h=0 , 2 and 2.5 t . in zero field ,",

    "the new satellites correspond to a smaller magnetic unit cell in the * b*@xmath34 direction . at 2.5 t , the zero field",
    "@xmath26=0.05 satellites completely vanish . in turn , the @xmath35=0.072 satellites disappear at h=3 t , corresponding to the field of the second magnetization jump .",
    "this evolution with the field is best evidenced by plotting the intensity of the two magnetic reflections corresponding to the propagation vector (  @xmath26  0 ) , with @xmath26=0.05 and @xmath35=0.072 ( fig.[sweep ] bottom ) .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath26=0.05 reflection disappears above 2 t , while that with @xmath35=0.072 shows up .",
    "this one in turn vanishes at the second critical field of 3 t , above which only ferromagnetic ( fm ) contributions remain .",
    "finally , the intensity of ( fm ) reflections reach saturation at 4 t corresponding to the spin - flip field .    with the magnetic field applied along * b * , we monitored the scattering intensities corresponding to the * k@xmath27*=(@xmath28  @xmath26  0 ) and * k@xmath0 * = ( @xmath26  @xmath28  0 ) domains between 2 and 14k in fields up to 6 t .",

    "both reflections are observed with similar intensities as expected from the tetragonal space group . above 0.4 t ,",
    "the intensity of * k@xmath27 * vanishes at the benefit of * k@xmath0*. this first transition corresponds to a spin - flop transition selecting the ( a , c ) magnetic domains in which moments are orthogonal to the applied magnetic field . above 2.5 t",
    "the reverse process occurs with the sudden extinction of the * k@xmath0 * signal at the benefit of * k@xmath27*. finally , no antiferromagnetic contribution is observed above 4.3 t , the sample being fully polarized .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram extracted from neutron diffraction data is presented in fig.[sat_b010 ] bottom . comparing with the phase diagram for * h * // [ 100 ] in ref .",
    ", extracted from macroscopic measurements , one sees that the latter could not catch the first transition at low field . besides this",
    ", the overall agreement is good , except for the behaviour near the transition at @xmath37k which is shifted by about 0.5k in the neutron data .",
    "for the zero field and in - field magnetic structure determination , integrated intensity measurements were performed using a single counter .    in zero field , and for each * k * domain , 46 satellites were collected at 1.6k , of which about 25 ( 0 t ) were statistically relevant ( @xmath38 ) and used in the refinement .",
    "the magnetic structure was analyzed by using the propagation vector formalism .",
    "tetragonal symmetry and the highly symmetrical ( 0  0  z ) wykoff position occupied by the eu@xmath5 ion limits possible magnetic structures to amplitude modulated and helicoidal ones . first , models of a circular helix with moments constrained in the planes perpendicular to the highest symmetry axes ( * a*,*b*,*c * ) were tested .",
    "for all four propagation vectors the best fit was obtained for the helix envelope with the major axes of 7.6(3)@xmath39 lying in the plane perpendicular to the largest component of the propagation vector , namely the ( b , c ) plane for * k*@xmath27 and * k*@xmath2 , and the ( a , c ) plane for * k*@xmath0 and * k*@xmath8 . in this case",
    ", the moment rotates by @xmath40=90@xmath41 along the main component of the propagation vector .",
    "the corresponding magnetic structure is presented in figure [ structa ] left .",
    "the refinement yielded the following populations of domains in zero field : * k*@xmath27=35(5)% , * k*@xmath2=30(1)% , * k*@xmath0 = 15(2)% , and * k*@xmath8 = 20(5)% with 5.7%@xmath4218.9% .",
    "this is close to the expected random value of 25% for all domains .",
    "adding `` ellipticity '' to the helix ( while maintaining a common modulus for the moment ) yields a similar agreement factor . in this case , the angular increment along * k * is alternatively @xmath40 and @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the incremental angle @xmath40 can not be determined from the neutron data and both the circular and elliptic solutions are valid candidates .    with a field of 2.5 t along the * c*-axis ( i.e. between the two metamagnetic transitions ) , for",
    "each * k * vector , 46 satellites were collected at 1.6k , of which about twelve were statistically relevant and used in the refinement . in this case",
    "the antiferromagnetic contribution is well described by a similar circular structure with reduced ordered magnetic moment of @xmath44@xmath7 .",
    "we note that the associated error bars are bigger , with @xmath45 .",
    "this is due to a strong decrease of the antiferromagnetic signal after the first metamagnetic transition which resulted in the limited number of observed reflections . finally , above 3 t",
    ", a simple ferromagnetic contribution is observed reaching saturation at 4 t .    with the field along * b * , integrated intensities of * k@xmath27 * related reflections",
    "were collected at 5k and 4.5 t .",
    "a total of 111 reflections were collected , of which 12 were statistically relevant ( @xmath38 ) and used in the refinement .",
    "the antiferromagnetic contribution could not be refined with such a small set of reflections .",
    "however , neutrons are only sensitive to magnetic contributions orthogonal to the probed q - vector . in our dataset , the ( @xmath28 @xmath26 l ) reflections are not observed indicating the lack of an ordered magnetic moment in the orthogonal ( a , b ) plane .",
    "therefore , one can describe the ordered moments as being antiferromagnetically coupled and collinear along the * c*-axis .",
    "we have searched for a set of exchange integrals that would reproduce the zero field magnetic structure and the behavior of the magnetization , using a self - consistent calculation of the moment arrangement in the presence of exchange and dipole - dipole interactions among eu@xmath5 ions .",
    "since this calculation can not involve a large number of magnetic sites , it can not integrate the @xmath26 components of the propagation vector evidenced by neutron diffraction in both zero - field and in - field structures .",
    "based on the neutron diffraction results , we chose a propagation vector * k * = ( @xmath28  0  0 ) and hence a magnetic lattice cell with dimensions ( 4a , a , c ) containing 4 ions with @xmath46=0 and 4 ions with @xmath47 , i.e. 8 ions .",
    "the calculated structure consists of ferromagnetic ( b , c ) planes .",
    "the calculation does not either consider the twinning when computing the magnetization .",
    "consequently , it can not be expected to reproduce all of the experimental features and must be considered as approximate .",
    "we consider 4 isotropic exchange integrals , 3 of them intra - sublattice and one inter - sublattice , the sublattices in question being the simple tetragonal lattice and that obtained by the body centering translation with vector (  ) ( see fig.[ech ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the problem contains an exchange part ( a negative integral means an antiferromagnetic coupling ) , a dipolar interaction part and also an anisotropy , or crystal field , part .",
    "the two latter terms are needed for a realistic description of the system since they are of the same order of magnitude and their balance determines the direction of the moments .",
    "each ion is linked by exchange to its neighbors according to the paths described in fig.[ech ] , and a molecular field is calculated for each of the 8 ions in the cell .",
    "the infinite range dipolar field acting on each ion is calculated using an ewald type summation method @xcite .",
    "the dipolar field has no free parameter , it depends only on the way the magnetic cell is chosen .",
    "an axial anisotropy ( crystal field ) term is added with the form : @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a coefficient with magnitude a few 0.1k and @xmath50 is the component along * c * of the eu@xmath5 spin . for @xmath51 ,",
    "this term favors a moment alignment along * c * and for @xmath52 a moment arrangement in the ( a , b ) plane .",
    "the calculation is intended to reproduce not only the magnetic structure and the magnetization curves , with the correct spin - flip fields , but also the value of the nel temperature @xmath5313k and of the paramagnetic curie temperature @xmath544k @xcite .    we have tried to obtain a zero - field structure like that shown in fig.[structa ] a , which is the closest to the actual structure , neglecting the small @xmath26 component of the propagation vector .",
    "first , one finds that the @xmath49 coefficient must be taken negative , otherwise the moments have a strong affinity to lie in the ( a , b ) plane .",
    "then , one must take @xmath550 and @xmath560 to obtain ferromagnetic ( b , c ) planes and alternating moment directions along * a*. the other integrals @xmath57 and @xmath58 have no obviously required sign . exploring the \\{@xmath59 } space of exchange integrals with reasonable values , we found that the magnetization jumps at 2 and 3 t for * h * // * c * can not be reproduced together .",
    "the parameter set we propose reproduces the spin - flop at an intermediate value 2.5 t and the spin - flip at 4 t for * h * // * c * , the spin - flip at 6 t for * h * // * a * or * b * , and the correct @xmath60 and @xmath61 values .",
    "it yields a zero - field structure of `` elliptic '' type , i.e. the moments lie in the ( b , c ) plane with an incremental angle @xmath40=65@xmath41 both for the ions with @xmath46=0 and @xmath62 ) ( see fig.[structa ] b ) .",
    "[ ht ]    neither the phase shift between the two spirals nor their absolute position can be ascertained in the calculation .",
    "the parameter set reads : @xmath57 = 0.1k , @xmath58 = 0.1,k , @xmath63 = 0.7k , @xmath640.6k and @xmath650.25k .",
    "the calculated magnetization curves are represented in fig.[mh3dir ] ; they are to be compared with the experimental data in fig.[squid ] . for * h * // * a * ( orange curve ) , the magnetization is linear with the field , which is to be expected since * h * is perpendicular to the ( b , c ) plane of the spiral , inducing a conical moment arrangement . for * h * // * b * ( magenta curve ) , a dip is observed , which is due to the fact that the conical structure is not realized , when the field lies in the plane of the spiral , until a threshold spin - flop field is reached , here 1.3 t . in the insert of fig.[mh3dir ] , the red curve is an average of the magnetizations along * a * and",
    "* b * , simulating the presence of domains .",
    "it is readily comparable with the data shown in the insert of fig.[squid ] , and the calculated spin - flop field of 1.3 t is in very good agreement with the measured value .      in the above parameter",
    "set , the absolute value of @xmath66 , 0.6k , is six times larger than that of @xmath57 , 0.1k .",
    "this may seem puzzling , since the next nearest neighbour distance along * a * is twice the nearest neighbour distance .",
    "the dominant exchange in eunige@xmath0  is probably the rkky interaction , which varies with distance as @xmath67 , but which is an oscillating function of @xmath68 .",
    "then , one may speculate that a large @xmath69 ratio can happen if rkky exchange is close to a node for @xmath70 and is maximum for @xmath71 .",
    "the dzyaloshinski - moriya ( dm ) exchange @xcite was not included in the calculation , although the nearest neighbour ion pairs allow for a non - zero dm vector , their midpoint not being an inversion center .",
    "introduction of dm exchange could induce the observed incommensurability , but it is likely that it can not account for another puzzling feature of the magnetic structure of eunige@xmath0 : the symmetry breaking between the * a * and * b * axes .",
    "indeed , the zero - field propagation vector , for instance * k*@xmath27 = ( @xmath26 0 ) , is asymmetric with respect to * a * and * b*. at present , we have no explanation as to the source of this asymmetry in a tetragonal compound .    among eu intermetallics of the type eumx@xmath0 , where m is a @xmath72 metal and x ge or si",

    "it is of interest to gather the information about the number of magnetic transitions and the magnetic structure of the low temperature phase in the eumx@xmath0 intermetallics ( putative , except for eunige@xmath0 ) , as shown in table [ mt ] .",

    "there seems to be a correlation between the number of transitions and the plane of the spiral structure : one observes one transition if the spiral lies in the ( a , b ) plane , and two transitions if the spiral lies in the ( b , c ) or ( a , c ) plane , or if there is no spiral . in all the compounds ,",
    "the intermediate phase between the two transitions is an incommensurate modulated phase , probably collinear , as determined by mssbauer spectroscopy .",
    "one can conjecture that a spiral lying in the ( a , b ) plane is more stable than a spiral in the ( b , c ) or ( a , c ) planes , which breaks the tetragonal symmetry , as mentioned above . in the latter case , the transition from paramagnetism would therefore occur first towards the intermediate phase , then to the spiral phase .",
