    "muti - dimensional datasets are now prevalent across the sciences , and their importance will only continue to grow  @xcite .",
    "this affluence of data demands new methods that respect multi - dimensional structures and exploit them .",
    "we introduce a versatile new data clustering framework based on tensors ( high dimensional arrays ) and algebra to analyze multi - dimensional datasets . one key feature of this method is that , given application specific constraints on the composition of a cluster , it is guaranteed to find the optimal partition .",
    "the flexibility of the method allows it to be used directly on a dataset ( i.e. , as a standalone clustering tool ) , or in combination with other clustering methods .",
    "we showcase our method on a set of time - course measurements of the activation levels of the mapk and pi3k pathways , by analyzing the phosphorylation of erk and akt respectively , in 36 breast cancer cell lines after exposure to 14 ligands ( growth factors )  @xcite . because the dataset is _ complete _ ( i.e. , there is a measurement for every combination of times , proteins , cell lines , ligands , and doses ) we can represent it as a tensor in five dimensions ( fig .",
    "we exploit this tensorial representation to explore the crosstalk between signaling pathways that are known to dysfunction in cancer following their exposure to specific growth factors  @xcite . although the key signaling proteins and subtype responses in breast cancer cells are known , the dynamics and mechanisms of signal transduction networks across genetically diverse cell lines are not well understood  @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms are important to understand because they have been shown to be related to cellular decisions and fates  @xcite .",
    "we then perform a systematic and exhaustive search of mathematical models for each cluster from a large pool of candidates .",
    "our analysis consists of two main steps .",
    "first , we use tensors and algebra to find clusters of experiments subject to _ structural or interpretability constraints _ ( fig .",
    "second , we perform a systematic search for nonlinear ordinary differential equation ( ode ) models that reproduce the key dynamical features of the time series in each cluster ( fig .  1d ) .",
    "we find clusters of experiments with similar response to the stimuli using a novel notion of tensor similarity .",
    "we then use integer programming to find clusters that are globally optimal .",
    "these partitions can be visualized by color - coding the entries of the tensor according to their cluster assignment .",
    "we impose the structural constraint that each cluster be rectangle - shaped on the tensor ( although possibly disconnected ) .",
    "this constraint ensures that that clusters match a subset of the cell lines ( which have various mutations ) with the subset of growth factors whose effect on the signaling pathway is altered by the mutation .",
    "if two experiments , belong to the same cluster , then the diagonally opposite entries in the tensor must also belong to the same cluster ( see fig .",
    "the constraints allow us to demand , for example , that measurements inside a cluster are consistent with the same biological mechanism .",
    "one of the strengths of our approach , is that it can work with pre - existing non - rectangular partitions of the data obtained from established methods ( e.g. , @xmath0-means , spectral methods , community detection on graphs ) .",
    "starting from an initial partition is computationally advantageous and our method is able to find the nearest optimal rectangular clustering .",
    "once an optimal partition of the data into clusters is obtained , we look for mechanisms that can explain the behavior observed in each cluster .",
    "we explore differences between clusters to understand the variation of the signaling mechanisms across cancer cell lines . to this end",
    ", we construct , parametrize , and rank models for each cluster from a pool of 729 candidate models that best describe the data .",

    "the groups we find respect the broad division of the cell lines seen in fig .",
    "2a , b , which is a sign of the consistency between the two implementations of our method .",
    "we obtained our initial clustering by first constructing a graph of experiments using the relaxed minimum spanning tree algorithm  @xcite .",
    "then we used the markov stability community detection method  @xcite to obtain the clusters .",
    "markov stability identifies robust partitions of the experiments into three , five and seven groups ( see si appendix ) .",
    "from the initial partition into three clusters , we obtain three rectangular clusters ( fig .",
    "of these , we find that two groups of ligands correspond to previously reported high active expression profiles ( yellow and green ) and one to muted profiles ( blue ) , respectively  @xcite . within the more highly active group , the hr@xmath108 cell lines are predominantly in the yellow cluster , while the her2@xmath107 cells are in the green cluster .",
    "this separation of the hr@xmath108 and her2@xmath107 clinical subtypes is entirely data driven and supports the notion that our method is indeed able to find interpretable groups .",

    "the tnbc cell lines are divided between the yellow and green clusters , providing further evidence of the heterogeneity in tnbc cell lines  @xcite .",
    "when we use initial clustering into five groups , the rectangular clusters split the ligands into a low response group ( blues ) and high response ( green , yellow , brown ) .",
    "this split is nearly the same as we obtained before ( fig .",
    "note that the difference in the ligand hgf may be due to the fact that it is not part of the erbb nor the fgf families of ligands .",

    "while none of them have the same cell classification or genetic mutation , all cell lines in the brown cluster show high susceptibility to gefitinib  @xcite .",
    "note that mda - mb-175-vii is the only hr@xmath110 cell line that is not assigned to the yellow group in either three or five clusters ; this might be due to the fact that this cell line carries a unique chromosomal translocation .",
    "the translocation leads to the fusion and amplification of neuregulin-1 which signals through erbb2/erbb3 heterodimers  @xcite , and could be the underlying cause of the cell line s unique sensitivity to erbb - targeting drugs like lapatinib or afatinib  @xcite .",
    "finally , the clustering that begins with an initial partition into seven groups shows high consistency with the five cluster case ( see si appendix ) .",
    "we therefore continue our analysis on the five clusters .",
    "we now analyze the response of the five structured groups found in the previous section ( fig .",
    "2d ) to obtain a mechanistic insight about how the cell line / ligand combinations in them respond to the stimuli .",
    "we perform systematic model analysis of 729 possible network models , and find that with our data 44 are structurally identifiable , a prerequisite for performing parameter estimation and model selection .",
    "then , we parametrize , rank and choose the models that best represent each cluster s response . as a result , we have a list of candidate signaling mechanisms for each cluster which provides more information than the statistical predictions of the sensitivity of map kinase drug targets ( e.g. , erbb drug class )  @xcite .",
    "models of the mapk and akt pathways have been studied under a variety of biological and modeling assumptions  @xcite , including pathway crosstalk  @xcite .",
    "here we consider simple models to ensure the parameters are at least locally identifiable so there are a finite number of parameter values to fit the data .",
    "see the si appendix for a brief synopsis of mapk models .",
    "we construct nonlinear ordinary differential equation models to describe the dynamics of the akt and erk signaling pathways .",
    "these models include three molecular species : receptor ( r ) , perk ( e ) and pakt ( a ) .",
    "since the data contains the response of perk and pakt , we assume that the receptor must phosphorylate erk and/or akt .",
    "we consider positive , negative , or no interaction between perk and pakt under different types of kinetic regimes ( mass - action or michaelis - menten ) and different types of inhibition ( blocking / sequestration or removal / degradation ) .",
    "the combination of these features result in the 44 structurally identifiable models that we study in further detail .",
    "each model corresponds to a different mechanistic hypothesis of the dynamics in the pathways ( see si appendix ) . to find the models",
    "that best describe the response of each of the five clusters , we estimate parameters using the squeeze - and - breathe algorithm  @xcite , and rank them using the akaike information criterion score ( aicc ) ( see si appendix ) .",
    "the best models for each cluster are shown in fig .",
    "the aicc penalizes more complex models ; therefore it is not surprising that the top models are the simplest ones .",
    "the best models for each cluster have different feedback strengths ( parameter values ) and network topologies ( see fig .",
    "3 ) ; this supports the hypothesis that mutations may play a role in the dynamics .",
    "although the values of the parameters vary , the model with arrows from the receptor to pakt and perk appears in all clusters , which is in line with how cells are understood to operate .",
    "we remark that cluster 4 , which corresponds to hr@xmath110 cells ( yellow in fig .",
    "2d ) , includes inhibition crosstalk as the second best model , whereas in all other clusters this mechanism appears in fourth place .",
    "these results support the notion that clusters may have different parameter values / network structure and that our approach is viable . as more comprehensive datasets become available , for example including the receptor dynamics , and more molecular species , we will be able to incorporate more complex models to our approach .",
    "we presented a framework for analyzing multi - indexed data that allows structural constraints to be incorporated .",
    "this structural imposition also relates to machine learning techniques in the sense that it is an unsupervised , data - driven clustering method , since the groups into which the data is divided are not labeled at the start .",
    "however , the method allows the user to exercise more control than in many unsupervised methods due to the pre - defined constraints on what the final clusters can look like .",
    "we tested this method on an extensive dataset charting the response of genetically diverse breast cancer cell lines to ligands .",
    "we identified both similarities an heterogeneities within clinical subtypes .",
    "the heterogeneity seems to be related to both the mutational status of the cells as well as their response to inhibitors .",
    "this means that similar analyses in patient tissues might identify patients that respond differently to therapeutics commonly used within a clinical subtype . by analyzing clusters from all subtypes",
    ", we also showed that we can not explain the dynamics of each data cluster with only one mathematical model .",
    "our methodology is general and can be adapted to a variety of structural restrictions .",
    "for example , when there are size restrictions on the clusters , or to impose / prohibit particular combinations of data .",
    "subject to such constraints , the method finds an optimal clustering via a metric of the user s choosing .",
