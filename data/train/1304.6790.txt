    "the paper is devoted to mathematical theory of brownian ( molecular ) motors .",
    "the concept of a brownian motor has fundamental applications in the study of transport processes in living cells and ( in a slightly different form ) in the porous media theory .",
    "there are thousands of publications in the area of brownian motors in the applied literature .",
    "for example , the review by p. riemann @xcite contains 729 references .",
    "most of these publications are in physics or biology journals and are not mathematically rigorous .",
    "some of them are based on numerical computations .",
    "consider a set of particles with an electrical charge performing brownian motion in a tube @xmath0 with periodic ( or stationary random ) cross section ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .     with  fingers \" . one can expect that @xmath1 . ]",
    "we will assume that the axis of @xmath0 is directed along the @xmath2-axis .",
    "let s apply a constant external electric field @xmath3 along the axis of @xmath0 .",
    "then the motion of the particles consists of the diffusion and the stocks drift , and the corresponding generator has the form @xmath4 complemented by the neumann boundary condition on @xmath5 ( we assume the normal reflection at the boundary ) .    one can expect that the displacement of the particles on the large time scale may be approximated ( due to homogenization ) by a one - dimensional diffusion process @xmath6 along the @xmath2-axis with an effective drift @xmath7 and an effective diffusivity @xmath8 , which depend on @xmath9 and the geometry of the tube @xmath0 . if we reverse the direction of the external field from @xmath3 to @xmath10 , then the corresponding effective drift @xmath11 and the corresponding effective diffusivity @xmath12 will be , generally , different from @xmath7 and @xmath8 when @xmath0 is not symmetric with respect to the reflection @xmath13 .",
    "for example , one can expect that @xmath14 for @xmath0 shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the difference between the effective parameters can be significant . then by changing the direction of the exterior electric field @xmath3 periodically in time",
    ", one could construct a constant drift in , say , the negative direction of @xmath2 and create a device ( motor ) producing energy from brownian motion .",
    "the idea of molecular motors goes back to m. smoluchowski , r. feynman , l. brillouin .",
    "starting from the 1990-s , it became a hot topic in chemical physics , molecular biology , and thermodynamics .",
    "the following natural problem must be solved by mathematicians :    \\1 . the homogenization procedure ( reduction to a one - dimensional problem ) must be justified .",
    "expressions for effective parameters @xmath15 in terms of an appropriate pde or a spectral problem on the period of @xmath0 ( in the case of periodic tubes ) must be found .",
    "for some natural geometries of @xmath0 that include a small parameter , asymptotic expressions for effective parameters need to be obtained .",
    "we solve the first two problems here using an analytic approach that justifies the homogenization procedure and allows us to express the effective parameters in terms of the principal eigenvalue of a spectral problem on one period of @xmath0 .",
    "we will also provide a couple of simple consequences of the obtained formulas .",
    "we show that @xmath16 when @xmath17 .",
    "thus , since @xmath7 is analytic in @xmath9 , it is a strictly monotone function of @xmath9 when @xmath18 is small enough .",
    "simple asymptotic formulas for the effective parameters will be justified for periodic tubes with nearly separated dead zones .",
    "note that the first two problems listed above also can be solved with probabilistic techniques similar to those used for homogenization of periodic operators in @xmath19 , as we ll discuss in a forthcoming paper .",
    "our approach is based on the bloch decomposition .",
    "recently several papers appeared ( see @xcite and references there ) , where the bloch decomposition was used to study homogenization problems in periodic media .",
    "it was shown that this approach has many advantages ( when it is applicable ) .",
    "so far , this approach was applied to self - adjoint elliptic equations in the whole space or in a domain with a finite boundary .",
    "the symmetry and the existence of a bounded inverse operator were essential there .",
    "we consider a parabolic problem .",
    "it is non - self - adjoint due to the drift , which can not be neglected since it is essential for applications . besides",
    ", the homogenization is applied only with respect to one variable .",
    "all these features ( the non - symmetry is the main difficulty ) make the problem under consideration essentially different from the applications of the bloch decomposition in the homogenization mentioned above .",
    "we also would like to note the presence of the boundary integral term in the formula for the effective drift ( see theorem [ gt ] ) . in probabilistic terms , it arises from the re - normalized time spent by the brownian motion with the drift on the boundary ( local time ) .",
    "our next paper based on a probabilistic approach to the problem will contain the detailed analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the effective parameters with respect to the parameters describing the geometry of the domain .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "lemma [ ml ] describes the properties of the principal eigenvalue @xmath20 of the bloch spectral problem on the cell of periodicity of @xmath0 .",
    "the main results on homogenization are obtained in theorems [ t1 ] and [ t2 ] . in particular , it is shown there that the effective drift @xmath21 and the effective diffusivity @xmath8 are given by the coefficients of the taylor expansion of the eigenvalue @xmath22 . to be more exact , @xmath23 expressions for the effective parameters through the harmonic coordinate and the invariant measure",
    "are given in theorem [ gt ] .",
    "the latter formulas are applied to a particular class of domains in the last section .",
    "periodic tubes with nearly separated dead zones are considered there .",
    "we rigorously justified the asymptotic formula for the effective diffusivity , which was found earlier for domains with somewhat simpler geometry in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "consider a tube @xmath24 , @xmath25 periodic in @xmath2 with period 1 , with a smooth boundary @xmath26 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . denote by @xmath27 the cross - section of @xmath0 by the plane @xmath28 orthogonal to the @xmath2-axis at the point @xmath29 we assume that @xmath27 is bounded ( and periodic with respect to  @xmath29 ) .    in the simplest case ,",
    "the boundary of the cross - section is a function of the angular variables .",
    "for instance , @xmath27 is the ball of the radius @xmath30 if @xmath31 is the surface of revolution .",
    "however , in general it may have a very complicated form .",
    "for example , @xmath0 in fig.1 contains  fingers \" (  dead ends \" in the terminology of [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] ) , and @xmath32 is not connected when @xmath33 .",

    "one also can define a connected cell of periodicity @xmath35 in fig.1 using planes @xmath28 through @xmath40 and @xmath41 by cutting only the central narrow part of @xmath0 , but not cutting the fingers . in the latter case",
