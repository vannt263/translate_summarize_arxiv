    "while it has now been established for more than 5 years that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are caused by some of the most energetic explosions in the universe ( van paradijs , kouveliotou , & wijers 2000 ) , no promising channel for their progenitors has been identified , a situation very much resembling that of the progenitors of type ia supernovae some 20 years ago .",
    "the firm and , unlike the previous case , unambiguous association of a grb ( grb030329 ) with a hypernova , sn  2003dh ( hjorth et al .  2003a ; stanek et al .",
    "2003 ) , a highly energetic type ic supernova ( mazzali et al .  2003)ergs",
    "( nomoto et al .",
    "] , has confirmed that at least some long - duration grbs are _ observationally _ connected with the explosion of massive stars .",
    "all hypernovae known to date belong to the class of type ic supernovae ( sne  ic ) , of which they form a subset .",
    "these are sne that show neither hydrogen nor significant amounts of helium in their spectra .",
    "their progenitors are believed to be either very massive single stars that lost their hydrogen and helium envelopes in a stellar wind or massive stars that lost their envelopes through the interaction with a companion ( wheeler & levreault 1985 ; uomoto 1986 ; podsiadlowski , joss , & hsu 1992 ; nomoto et al .",
    "two out of the three nearby grbs known to date are associated with hypernovae ( grb980425/sn  1998bw at @xmath3 and grb030329/sn  2003dh at @xmath4 ) .",
    "the third case , grb031203 , is heavily extinguished by dust , so a sn association can not be firmly ruled out ( hjorth et al .",
    "this interesting coincidence raises the important question of the general connection between hypernovae and long - duration grbs , and whether most , or perhaps even all grbs are associated with / caused by hypernovae .",
    "this paper addresses this question by providing a critical comparison of the rates of grbs and hypernovae . as is shown in",
    "  2 , the rates of grbs and hypernovae are comparable within the uncertainties , and appear to be a small fraction of the global sn rate .",
    "this has important implications for the nature of their progenitors , which is discussed in detail in   3 and   4 .",
    "the rate of _ observed _ grbs in a galaxy like our own is quite well established from the batse monitoring as @xmath5yr@xmath2 ( e.g. zhang & meszaros 2003 ) .",
    "however , since grb fireballs are highly beamed , both geometrically and relativistically ( with lorentz factors @xmath6 ) , the true intrinsic rate must be substantially higher .",
    "it may be written as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the solid angle within which an observer can detect the grb .",
    "this factor depends on the jet opening angle , and is typically estimated as @xmath9500 ( frail et al . 2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "the rate is however uncertain , as @xmath10 and @xmath8 are estimated from two different samples , @xmath10 from the batse sample , and @xmath8 from the sample of grbs with afterglow observations , and there is no robust evidence that the selection effects are the same in the two sets .",
    "additionally , the solid angle correction is based on the so - called uniform jet model , in which the opening angle is an intrinsic property of the jet .",
    "an alternative explanation of the observations calls for a structured jet , with a brighter core and dimmer wings . in this case",
    "the rate of grbs would be smaller by a factor 310 ( rossi , lazzati , & rees 2002 ) .",
    "thus the range of plausible values for the grb rate is @xmath0 to @xmath1yr@xmath2 , of which about @xmath11 are long - duration grbs .      to date",
    ", five sne ic have been classified as hypernovae .",
    "they form quite a diverse group of objects , ranging from the very bright and energetic sne 1998bw ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) and 2003dh ( mazzali et al .   2003 ) , the moderately bright but very energetic sne 1997ef ( mazzali et al .",
    "2000 ) and 1997dq ( mazzali et al . , in preparation ) , and the normally bright but over - energetic sn  2002ap ( mazzali et al .  2002 ) . based on spherically symmetric explosion models ,",
    "their explosion energies have been estimated to range between 4 and 50foe , and the progenitor masses from a lower limit of 2025  to 40  and above .",
    "this covers the entire mass range of single stars that are believed to become black holes ( e.g. maeder 1992 ; fryer & kalogera 2001 ) .    interestingly , no hypernova is known to have the characteristics of a sn  ii , although such objects might in principle occur in the lower mass range ( depending somewhat on the minimum initial mass for which a _ single _ star becomes a wolf - rayet star ) .",
    "this may provide an important clue , linking the physical cause of the hypernova mechanism to the process causing the loss of the hydrogen and helium envelope . in this context",
    ", we note as a caveat that the inferred initial masses of hypernovae are based on the final core structure expected from single - star evolution .",
    "if , the pre - hypernova evolution was affected by binary evolution , as seems possible or even likely ( see   3 ) , this mapping must be modified .    as the lowest initial mass that is able to produce a hypernova appears to be @xmath12",
    ", this implies that not all sne ic are hypernovae .",
    "for example , nomoto et al .",
    "( 1994 ) estimate that the progenitor of the normal sn ic 1994i was 15  ( again assuming a single - star mapping of the initial to the final mass ) .",
    "sne ic may come from progenitors as low in mass as @xmath13 if they are in a binary ( podsiadlowski et al .  1992 ; nomoto et al .  1994 ) .",
    "the estimated rate of all core - collapse supernovae is @xmath14yr@xmath2 for an average galaxy and @xmath15yr@xmath2 in our galaxy ( cappellaro et al .",
    "the latter estimate is somewhat lower than recent estimates for the galactic pulsar birth rate of @xmath16yr@xmath2 based on the parkes multi - beam survey ( vranesevic et al .",
    "in contrast , the observed rate of type ib and ic supernovae in an average galaxy in the local universe is only @xmath17yr@xmath2 .",
    "most ib / c supernovae actually appear to belong to the ic sub - type and only a fraction of about 5% of _ observed _ sne ic are hypernovae .",
    "the brightness of hypernovae is highly diverse , ranging from normal to about 10 times normal .",
    "however , the average of the known cases is a factor of @xmath185 brighter than a typical sn  ic .",
    "therefore , we expect that hypernovae are easier to detect and hence intrinsically less common relative to normal sne ic than the direct observational estimate .",
    "being on average a factor 4 brighter implies that in a magnitude - limited search they would be detectable in a volume larger by a factor of @xmath19 .",
    "however , because many of the current sn searches only target selected galaxies , they are also volume limited .",
    "thus , in a typical sn search the expected number of sne grows more or less linearly with sn magnitude ( cappellaro et al .",
    "reducing the observed rate by the proper factor gives us an estimate of the true hypernova rate of @xmath20yr@xmath2 .",
    "the estimates of the rates of grbs and hypernovae in the previous section are the same to within the uncertainties ( see table  1 ) , although the hypernova rate may be slightly higher .",
    "this suggests that most hypernovae also appear as grbs at least from some viewing angle .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that hypernovae are associated with at least two out of three nearby grbs , one of which was typical while the other was weak .",
    "it is also consistent with the fact that only the most powerful hypernovae are seen in association with grbs .",
    "events that appear less powerful may simply be viewed off - axis , leading to an underestimation of the kinetic energy and to the non - detection of the grb .",
    "sn  2002ap could be such a case , since there is ample evidence that the explosion was aspherical , like sn  1998bw ( mazzali et al .",
    "2002 , maeda et al .   2003 ) .",
    "this may also imply that the beaming correction can not be too large .",
    "the estimates allow for the possibility that some hypernovae do not produce grbs , as in some popular models ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) the relativistic jet may not always break through the envelope of the progenitor star .",
    "this may give rise to a ` failed grb ' with an orphan afterglow , as has been suggested for sn  2002ap ( totani 2003 ) , or to short - duration x - ray flashes ( xrfs ; heise et al .",
    "possible evidence for this comes from the reported detection of a sn - like `` bump '' in the light curve of an x - ray flash ( xrf030723 , fynbo et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "sn - like bumps have been detected in the light curves of grb optical afterglows , but only for one such case ( grb021211/sn2002lt , @xmath21 ) is a spectrum available : della valle et al .",
    "( 2003 ) argue that it is similar to that of the standard sn  ic 1994i .",
    "however , the extracted sn u - band light curve ( other bands not being available ) appears significantly brighter than the u - band light curve of sn  1994i , so a hypernova solution for sn  2002lt can not be firmly ruled out .",
    "if a clear case of association of a normal sn  ic and a grb should be revealed , we may have to lower the mass limit of stellar collapses that trigger a grb .",
    "these estimates are also in broad agreement with those of berger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and soderberg , frail , & wieringa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . based on a comparison of the radio emission from hypernovae and",
    "sne ib / c , these studies conclude that @xmath22% and @xmath23 , respectively , of sne ib / c can be associated with grbs .",
    "in contrast , lamb et al.(2003 ) recently argued that , based on a universal jet model for xrfs and grbs , the jet opening angle is as small as 0.5@xmath24 .",
    "this would imply an xrf / grb rate comparable to the sn ib / c rate .",
    "our rate estimates suggest that grbs and hypernovae constitute a small subset of core - collapse supernovae ( also see , paczyski 2001 ) .",
    "does this imply that only very massive stars become hne / grbs ? in table  1 we list the estimated rates for stars above various different masses , using a simple salpeter - like mass function ( @xmath25 ) and assuming for simplicity that all stars above 8  produce a core - collapse supernova .",
    "clearly , even if the minimum initial mass for a hn / grb was larger than 80 , they would be significantly overproduced .",
    "on the other hand , the initial progenitor mass in some hypernovae appears to be as low as 20(mazzali et al .",
    "2002 ; but see footnote 9 ) .",
    "lc core - collapse supernovae & @xmath26 + radio pulsars ( galactic ) & @xmath16 + sne ib / c & @xmath27 + hypernovae & @xmath28 +   + @xmath29&@xmath30 + @xmath31&@xmath32 + @xmath33&@xmath34 + massive stars + @xmath35&@xmath36 + @xmath37&@xmath30 + @xmath38&@xmath39 +    in conclusion , it is extremely unlikely that the progenitors of hypernovae and grbs are just very massive stars .",
    "special circumstances are almost certainly needed .",
    "the most promising of these is rotation : a rapidly rotating core is the essential ingredient in the ` collapsar ' model for grbs ( woosley 1993 ; paczyski 1998 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "the prototype hypernova , sn 1998bw , shows clear evidence from the line profiles that the explosion was highly asymmetric ( maeda et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "_ the role of rotation _    massive stars are generally rapid rotators on the main sequence . however , there are many well - established mechanisms by which they can lose their angular momentum during their evolution by both hydrodynamical ( e.g.  winds ) and magnetohydrodynamical processes ( spruit & phinney 1998 ; spruit 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , it is not at all clear whether the cores of massive single stars will ever be rotating rapidly at the time of explosion . in this context",
    ", rapid rotation means sufficiently rapid that the core can not collapse directly to form a neutron star / black hole and conserve angular momentum .",
    "a simple criterion is that the specific angular momentum , @xmath40 , near the edge of the iron core ( enclosing a mass @xmath41 ) is larger than the value at the last stable orbit around a black hole of that mass , i.e.   @xmath42 .",
    "recent calculations taking into account magnetic torques ( heger et al .",
    "2003 ) suggest that single massive stars fall short of this requirement by about one order of magnitude",
    ".    to have a sufficiently rapidly rotating core at the time of explosion may require interactions with a binary companion that can spin up the progenitor or prevent its spin - down .",
    "_ the role of binarity _    binary interactions can spin up a star by a variety of processes .",
    "tidal interactions can cause either component of a binary to rotate with the same frequency as the binary , spinning it up or down depending on the relative frequencies . for a star spinning",
    "synchronously with the binary orbit and filling a fraction @xmath43 of its roche lobe , the ratio of its rotation frequency , @xmath44 , to its ( keplerian ) breakup frequency , @xmath45 , just depends on the mass ratio according to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mass ratio ( @xmath48 is the roche - lobe filling object and @xmath49 the accreting star ) and @xmath50 is the ratio of the roche - lobe radius to the orbital separation ( as , e.g. , given by eggleton 1983 ) .",
    "if we require that in a collapsar model only the inner - most core of @xmath51 can collapse directly while the rest forms a disk , we can obtain a rough estimate for the maximum orbital period where tidal spin - up can provide enough angular momentum to the core by assuming that the whole star remains in solid body rotation until the end of helium burning . at this stage the core is likely to decouple and will probably retain most of its angular momentum in the final rapid evolutionary phases .",
    "taking the radius of the 2  core as @xmath52 cm ( typical for the core of a 30  star at the end of helium burning ) , one then immediately obtains a critical orbital period @xmath53 .",
    "izzard et al.(2003 ) , using detailed binary population calculations , concluded that there are enough binaries where tidal locking could account for the observed rates .",
    "the black - hole binary nova sco may provide indirect observational support for this channel .",
    "the companion in nova sco is polluted with heavy elements from the sn that formed the black hole ( israelian et al .",
    "podsiadlowski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) concluded that the observed abundances are more consistent with a hypernova than with a normal sn .",
    "the birthrate of such black - hole binaries is comparable to the hn / grb rate ( see , e.g. , lee , brown , & wijers 2002 ; podsiadlowski , rappaport , & han 2003 ) .    tidal locking is also likely to have spun up the wr companion ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "1992 ) in the close x - ray binary cyg x-3 , which has an orbital period of 4.8hr .",
    "thus cyg x-3 is a potential hn / grb progenitor , although the mass of the wr may be too small to lead to the formation of a black hole .",
    "nevertheless , the birthrate of systems like cyg x-3 , one of the main channels to produce double - neutron - star binaries , is comparable to our estimate of the hn / grb rate ( dewi & pols 2003 ; ivanova et al .",
    "2003 ; kalogera et al .",
    "2003 )    the most dramatic type of binary interaction involves the complete merging of two stars or at least of their cores ( fryer & woosley 1998 ; zhang & fryer 1999 ; ivanova & podsiadlowski 2003 ; joss & becker 2003 ; nomoto et al .",
    "for example , ivanova & podsiadlowski ( 2003 ) found that the core of the progenitor of sn  1987a was spun up dramatically in the merger , implying a rapidly rotating core at the time of the explosion .",
    "sn  1987a was not a hypernova , but there is some evidence that the explosion was jet - like ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2002 ; also see joss & becker 2003 ) .",
    "fryer & woosley ( 1998 ) suggested that the merger rate of black holes and helium cores inside a common envelope is compatible with the grb rate .",
    "none of these merger suggestions for hne / grbs have yet been worked out in detail .",
    "if the merger is caused by the spiral - in inside a hydrogen - rich common envelope , one has to understand how the merger can proceed and still lead to the ejection of the envelope ( which is required to provide the friction for the spiral in ) .",
    "moreover , all hypernovae are sne  ic , and thus the progenitors must have lost both their hydrogen and helium envelopes .",
    "the rates of hypernovae and grb are quite comparable , suggesting that a large fraction ( most ? ) of hypernovae also produce grbs , at least in some direction . moreover , the rates are significantly smaller than the rates of core - collapse sne ( or even the fraction of sne that produce black holes ) .",
    "furthermore , at least at the present cosmological epoch , special circumstances are required to produce hne / grbs . however , numerous fundamental questions remain unanswered , and no fully self - consistent evolutionary model for the progenitors exists at this time . as long as this is the case , it is not even clear whether or not the hypernova and the grb occur concurrently .",
    "does the hypernova occur first and trigger the grb through the fallback of hypernova ejecta , as may be required in some models ( vietri & stella 1998 ; podsiadlowski et al .",
    "2002 ) , or does the grb occur and then trigger a sn - like event through the interaction of the relativistic jet with the envelope as in the collapsar model ( khokhlov et al .  1999 ;",
    "macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; jason , woosley , & hoffman 2003 ) ?",
    "although hne / grbs appear to be relatively rare events at the present epoch , this need not be the case for the first generation of stars .",
    "lower metallicity may lead to lower angular - momentum loss from massive stars , and the star - formation environment may be very different .",
    "it is even conceivable that , at an early epoch of galaxy formation , hypernovae could provide the missing energy to eject half the baryons from galaxies ( silk 2003 ) .",
    "finally , another important question concerns the relationship between hypernovae and the class of sne ib / c , of which they are a subgroup .",
    "presumably , many normal sne ib / c are caused by the collapse of the core of a massive star that lost its h - rich envelope through binary interaction ( wheeler & levreault 1985 ; podsiadlowski et al .",
    "1992 ; nomoto et al .",
    "1994 ) forming a neutron star .",
    "so perhaps one important distinction between a hypernova and an ordinary supernova is whether a black hole or a neutron star is formed in the aftermath .",
    "however , not all black hole formation events can lead to a hypernova : if the minimum mass of a single star that leads to the formation of a black hole is as low as 2025  ( maeder 1992 ; fryer & kalogera 2001 ) , this would overproduce hypernovae by a large factor ( see table 1 ) .    a natural explanation for this dichotomy may lie in the fact that black holes can either form promptly on a dynamical timescale or on a much longer timescale by continued accretion through a disk phase or fallback . in particular",
    ", the disk accretion phase , which is the essential ingredient in collapsar models , requires a rapidly rotating core . in the case of prompt collapse",
    ", one would not necessarily expect a bright sn .",
    "this would imply the existence of a class of ( very ? ) dim sne ib / c for which there is , however , no observational evidence at present .    this work was in part supported by a european research & training network ( hprn - ct-20002 - 00303 ) and",

    "<S> these rates are several orders of magnitude lower than the rate of core - collapse supernovae , suggesting that the evolution leading to a hn / grb requires special circumstances , very likely due to binary interactions . </S>",
