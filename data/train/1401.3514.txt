    "the progress in the experimental activity in atomic physics , quantum optics and nanoscience has provided a great opportunity to investigate the nature of the quantum dynamics , and the interplay between quantum and statistical behaviors in particle systems . in particular , experiments with cold atoms realize systems which are accurately described by microscopic theoretical models such as dilute atomic fermi and bose gases , or hubbard and bose - hubbard models in optical lattices .",
    "see e.g. refs .",
    "a peculiar feature of these experiments is the confinement of the atoms , i.e. the presence of a inhomogeneous space - dependent ( usually harmonic ) trapping potential .",
    "the tunability of the confining potential allows the realization of quasi - two and quasi - one dimensional systems , by tightly confining the particles along one or two transverse dimensions .",
    "the inhomogeneity induced by the trapping potential gives rise to peculiar effects , such as the possibility of simultaneously observing different phases , in particular mott incompressible ( insulator ) and superfluid ( metallic ) phases , depending on the distance from the center of the trap .",
    "@xcite this is essentially due to the fact that the effective local chemical potential decreases with increasing the distance from the center of the trap center . at continuous quantum transitions",
    "the presence of the trap does not allow the development of critical modes with diverging length scales .",
    "however , in the limit of large trap size @xmath0 the system develops peculiar critical modes , which give rise to a universal trap - size scaling ( tss ) , controlled by the universality class of the transition of the homogeneous system  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in experiments of trapped particle systems , a thorough understanding of the quantum many - body dynamics calls for a quantitative analysis of the trap effects .",
    "this issue has been much discussed by theoretical and experimental investigations , see e.g. refs .  .",
    "in this paper we consider spin-1/2 fermion systems described by the lattice hubbard model , at zero temperature , therefore in their ground state .",
    "we investigate the scaling behavior of unpolarized systems , i.e. with equal number of spin - down and spin - up particles , when varying the size of the trap confining the particles .",
    "we mostly consider one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems with both attractive and repulsive interactions , in the dilute regime when the trap size @xmath0 increases keeping the particle number @xmath1 fixed , and in the _ trap thermodynamic _ limit defined as the large-@xmath1 limit keeping the ratio @xmath2 fixed .",
    "note that 1d fermion systems are also experimentally interesting , indeed their realizations , and evidences of pairing , have been recently reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the asymptotic trap - size dependence in the dilute regime for a system of @xmath1 particles can be described in the framework of the tss theory , whose scaling behavior is controlled by the dilute fixed point associated with the metal - to - vacuum quantum transition .",
    "this is controlled by the trap exponent @xmath5 related to the renormalization - group ( rg ) perturbation arising from the trapping potential , and requires a nontrivial rescaling of the on - site interaction in 1d systems .",
    "the tss predictions are compared with numerical results based on dmrg simulations .",
    "in particular , we address issues related to the expected crossover from strongly repulsive interactions , where the system assumes the properties of a free spinless fermi gas , to strongly attractive interactions , where the system is expected to be effectively constituted by hard - core bosonic ( spin zero ) molecules of two fermions , passing through a free fermi gas in the absence of interactions .    we also investigate the trap thermodynamic limit of the hubbard model , i.e. the large-@xmath0 and large-@xmath1 limit keeping the ratio @xmath6 fixed .",
    "in particular , we address issues related to the accuracy of the local - density approximation ( lda ) , which approximates the space - dependent particle density of a inhomogeneous trap by the particle density of the homogenous system at the corresponding value of the effective chemical potential .",
    "lda is usually used to determine the particle density in inhomogeneous systems , providing an accurate approximation when the inhomogeneity is sufficiently smooth .",
    "of course , lda is not exact , in particular at finite trap sizes .",
    "therefore , an analysis of the deviations from lda , and therefore of its accuracy , is required to get a robust confidence of its results .",
    "lda has been largely employed in studies of inhomogeneous interacting fermion systems , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein , an in particular of 1d systems  .",
    "the comparison with numerical results for the particle density shows that it provides a good approximation in many cases .",
    "a more quantitative analysis of the deviations from lda may be achieved by establishing whether lda becomes exact in the large trap - size limit , and how deviations get suppressed at large , but finite , @xmath0 .",
    "we investigate this issue in the trapped 1d hubbard model , where lda of the particle density can be exactly computed by bethe - ansatz methods  @xcite , allowing us to perform an accurate study of the deviations from lda .",
    "we show that lda of the particle density tends to become exact in the large trap - size limit , with power - law suppressed corrections .",
    "in particular , the corrections appear significantly larger at the boundary of the fermion cloud , decreasing as @xmath4 , due to the critical modes arising from the metal - to - vacuum transition at the edges of the trap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we present the hubbard model in the presence of an external potential coupled to the particle density ; we provide the definitions of the observables and correlations which are considered in the paper . in sec .",

    "[ conclusions ] we summarize our main results and draw our conclusions .",

    "we finally mention that the 1d hubbard model , even in the presence of an external confining potential , can be exactly mapped into a model of two interacting species ( flavors ) of hard - core bosons described by a bose - hubbard model , whose hamiltonian is formally analogous to that of the hubbard model with the fermionic operators @xmath39 replaced by hard - core bosonic operators @xmath40 .",

    "the above scaling behaviors are nicely confirmed by the dmrg data , see e.g. figs .",
    "[ rhobou ] , where we show results for the particle density keeping @xmath316 and @xmath317 fixed .",

    "the formation of a gas of molecules of pair fermions presents some analogies to the formation of a 3d molecule bec and the bcs - bec crossover for 3d fermi systems , which has been recently observed in experiments with ultracold fermi gases , see e.g. refs .  .",

    "indeed , while the large-@xmath1 scaling behavior of the particle density is realized keeping @xmath206 fixed , the large-@xmath1 behavior of the tss functions of the correlations is obtained keeping @xmath239 fixed , thus remaining significant only at short distance .",
    "the 1d hubbard model in the trap thermodynamic limit is asymptotically equivalent to introducing a chemical - potential term , as in eq .",
    "( [ chempot ] ) .",
    "we address the issue of the accuracy of the lda , which approximates the space - dependent particle density in a trap by the particle density of the homogenous system at the corresponding value of the effective chemical potential .",
    "lda is routinely used in the analyses of the numerical and experimental data of inhomogeneous particle systems .",
    "however , a quantitative analysis of the deviations from lda , and therefore of its accuracy , is required to get a robust confidence of its results , especially when the actual trap size is not very large and/or the system is close to criticality .    in the 1d hubbard model",
    "the validity of lda can be accurately checked because the particle density of homogenous systems can be exactly computed by bethe - ansatz methods .",
    "we show that lda becomes exact in the large trap - size limit keeping @xmath271 fixed , with power - law suppressed corrections .",
    "when the trapped system is in the metallic phase , the corrections to lda turn out to be @xmath3 and oscillating around the center of the trap .",
    "actually they may be further suppressed by appropriate averages around the center of the trap , likely to @xmath294 .",
    "however , they become much larger at the boundary of the fermion cloud , where they get suppressed as @xmath4 only . such an anomalous behavior at the boundary of the trapped fermion cloud is explained , and described , by a quantum critical behavior at the metal - to - vacuum transition occurring at the boundaries of the trap .    in our study we consider in particular the observables related to the particle density , double occupancy , and their correlations , determining the scaling behaviors of their space dependence along the trap .",
    "these features can be experimentally investigated by in situ imaging techniques for atomic quantum gases ,  @xcite which allow to probe the spatial dependence of the particle density , and also density fluctuations and density - density correlations , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the study of the scaling behavior of trapped interacting fermi systems may be extended considering also unbalanced systems . in this case",
    "attractive interactions give rise to new states such as the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state  @xcite , in which an unbalance in the populations with different spin leads to the formation of cooper pairs with nonzero momentum .",
    "experimental evidence of such states has been recently reported , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we expect that hubbard models describing trapped imbalanced fermi gases present a nontrivial scaling behavior as well , sharing most features with the balanced case .",
    "in particular , the extension of our analysis to imbalanced fermions in the dilute regime should be straightforward , a universal tss should be observed , analogously to that found in the balanced case , but with tss functions also depending on the total spin .",
    "in our paper we mostly focus on 1d systems , but the general features should also apply to higher - dimensional systems , in particular those related to the universal tss in the dilute regime , the accuracy of the lda , and the scaling behavior at the boundaries of the trap .",
    "we discuss the exact mapping between the 1d hubbard model and the bose - hubbard model with two bosonic fields .",
    "we consider the two - flavor bose - hubbard open chain of length @xmath70 with hamiltonian @xmath334 where @xmath335 is a bosonic creation operator and @xmath336 and @xmath337 is the particle density .",
    "we are interested in the hard - core limit @xmath338 , where @xmath339 is limited to the values 0 and 1 .    following ref .  , we first map the bose - hubbard model into a spin-1/2 system through the holstein - primakoff transformation @xmath340 then the spin-1/2 system can be mapped into a hubbard model through the jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite @xmath341 where @xmath342 the resulting hamiltonian is exactly the hubbard model hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",
    "the above mapping also applies if additional interactions only involving @xmath339 are present , e.g. , a trapping potential as in eq .",
    "( 4 ) or a nearest - neighbor @xmath343 coupling ( extended hubbard model ) .    concerning the boundary conditions ,",
    "while the case of obc is quite trivial , we note that periodic boundary conditions in @xmath344 are not equivalent to periodic boundary conditions in @xmath345 .",
    "the bethe - ansatz method allows us to solve exactly several 1d models , like the hubbard model , the xxz model , the gaudin  yang model , etc .",
    "this method reduces the complex many - particle scattering process between fermions to the composition of many two - particle processes , where particle momenta are not changed , but merely reassigned to different particles .",
    "this physical picture allows us to introduce a wavefunction ansatz where the role of momenta permutations is explicit : the ansatz keeps in account all possible outcoming scattering states , weighted with appropriate amplitudes .",

    "while these equations are in general difficult to solve , in the thermodynamic limit their solutions are approximated by particular solution patterns in the complex plane : assuming that all solutions can be approximated by these patterns allows us to rewrite the lieb - wu equations as integral equations which allow us to compute the thermodynamic quantities of the model . in the absence of external magnetic fields and at @xmath346 , the particle density @xmath347 for @xmath303 can be determined solving the integral - equation system @xmath348 where @xmath349 , @xmath350 is the dressed energy of the relevant elementary excitations of the model over the ground state and @xmath351 is the density of particles in the momentum space .",
