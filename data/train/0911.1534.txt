    "since the suggestion of @xmath0 suppression as a signal of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation by matsui and satz @xcite in 1986 the problem of quarkonium dissociation in hot and dense strongly interacting matter has played a key role for qgp diagnostics in relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "the original idea was that in a qgp the string tension of the confining potential vanishes and the residual one - gluon exchange interaction undergoes a debye screening by the color charges of the plasma .",
    "when the temperature dependent debye radius @xmath1 ( the inverse of the debye mass @xmath2 ) becomes shorter than the bohr radius of the charmonium ground state ( @xmath0 ) then the mott effect @xcite ( bound state dissociation ) occurs and the corresponding temperature is @xmath3 .",
    "this simple idea grew up to a multifacetted research direction when not only in the first light ion - nucleus collisions at the cern na38 experiment , but also in proton - nucleus collisions at fermilab @xmath0 suppression has been found so that there is not only a qgp but also a cold nuclear matter effect on charmonium production , see @xcite for a recent review .    if one wants to explore the question of screening in a plasma more in detail then a variety of approaches is available in the literature , from the original debye - hckel approach @xcite applicable to any vacuum potential ( for example the cornell potential ) , over the thermodynamic green functions approach to the ab - initio studies of heavy - quark potentials in lattice qcd . with",
    "the obtained medium - dependent potentials one can then study the bound state problem by solving the thermodynamic @xmath4 - matrix for quarkonia @xcite , or the equivalent schrdinger - type wave equation where medium effects are absorbed in a plasma hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "on the other hand one may calculate proper correlators directly from lattice qcd and extract from them spectral functions @xcite .",
    "there is an intriguing disagreement between the mott temperatures deduced from these spectral functions and those of the potential models : from the lattice data for quarkonium correlators one has extracted @xmath5 while in potential model calculations @xmath6 .",
    "this problem has lead to the discussion of the proper thermodynamical function to be used as a potential in the schrdinger equation , see @xcite and references therein .    in this contribution",
    "we follow the recently suggested @xcite modification of the standard one - loop calculation of the debye mass in thermal quantum field theory @xcite in the framework of the poyakov - nambu - jona - lasinio model , now widely used for a microscopic qcd - motivated description of mesons in quark matter @xcite .",
    "we then solve the schrdinger equation for charmonium and bottomonium states with the plasma hamiltonian @xcite corresponding to the screened cornell potential @xcite and obtain the mott dissociation temperatures of these states .",

    "the coupling to the polyakov loop potential leads to a suppression of the quark - antiquark excitations responsible for the screening of the heavy - quark potential in the present model .",

    "we have solved numerically the schrdinger equation to derive the mott criterion for bound states of the statically screened cornell potential and obtained mott temperatures in good agreement with previous results from nonrelativistic potential models exploiting lattice qcd singlet free energies as potentials in the schrdinger equation for heavy quarkonia .",
    "this agreement with previous results ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) includes also higher quarkonia resonances . for these states",
    "the stabilization effect is most pronounced since their mott temperatures lie in the region of temperatures where the suppression of quark - antiquark excitations due to the polyakov - loop potential is the largest .",
    "due to the lowering of the dissociation energies for heavy quarkonia states , their dissociation become possible by thermal activation already well before the mott temperatures are reached . according to the present work , even the tightly bound bottomonium ground state @xmath47",
    "may get `` boiled away '' at temperatures @xmath48 mev , well accessible already at rhic .",
