    "actually , a whole branch of experimental physics exists , known as quantum tomography , which purpose is reconstructing the wigner function from measurements@xcite . the most appealing feature of the wigner equation is that , distinct from the schrdinger wavefunction approach , it shares many analogies to the classical mechanism and simply reduces to the classical counterpart when the reduced planck constant vanishes@xcite . besides",
    ", the intriguing mathematical structure of the wigner equation has also been employed in some advanced topics , such as the deformation quantization@xcite .    despite its great advantages , solving the wigner equation",
    "has presented one of the most mathematical challenging problems , since the partial integro - differential equation is defined over @xmath2-dimensional phase space , where @xmath3 is the dimension of space and @xmath4 is the number of involved particles , making it even more complicated than the many - body schrdinger equation .",
    "for the one - dimensional one - body situation , the first try conducted by frensely in simulating the resonant tunneling diode uses the first - order upwind finite difference method ( fdm ) @xcite and after that several second - order fdms were introduced @xcite .",
    "later , a plane wave approximation of the wigner function@xcite and an operator splitting scheme@xcite were proposed .",
    "recently , several high - order methods have been well designed to capture accurately strong quantum effects , such as a cell average spectral element method ( sem)@xcite , moment methods@xcite , a weno - solver@xcite , etc .",
    "among all those solvers , the cell average sem has proven to be very reliable as it presents a simple but natural ( precise ) way to discretize the pseudo - differential term and avoids tremendously the artificial dissipation for the advection process@xcite .",
    "it has to be noted that , to our knowledge , all aforementioned deterministic methods have not yet been extended to many - body wigner simulations@xcite , even for the one - dimensional two - body case .",
    "very recently , a monte carlo method ( mcm ) based on signed particles for many - body winger simulations has attracted a lot of attention due to its simplicity as well as the satisfactory scaling on parallel machines@xcite .",
    "it has enabled a direct simulation of many - body wigner problems , such as the strongly correlated indistinguishable fermions@xcite , and its accuracy for the one - dimensional one - body problem has been validated by comparing with the cell average sem@xcite . despite the promising progress",
    ", it has also been mentioned that particle - based stochastic methods might not be very suitable for the problems where phase space quantities vary over several orders of magnitude@xcite . moreover , the highly oscillating structure of the wigner function due to the spatial coherence@xcite makes it a challenging task for both deterministic and stochastic methods to capture precisely the quantum interference and correlation . to give a better description of the quantum phenomena in a wider dynamic range and , at least , to provide a reliable reference solution for stochastic methods ,",

    ", we adopt the chebyshev spectral element method@xcite in @xmath5-space for it accurately resolves the oscillations of the wigner function , and avoids the artificial periodization at the same time .",
    "another major obstacle lies in the discretization of the advection term , because time steps employed by explicit runge - kutta integrators are strictly limited by the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) condition , thereby hampering the efficiency .",
    "the first - order upwind fdm , although alleviating this restriction , fails to provide satisfactory results due to the numerical dissipation@xcite . in order to overcome this obstacle , a semi - lagrangian - type characteristic method , which tracks the exact lagrangian advection on the spatial space grid in @xmath6-space ,",
    "will be introduced in this work .",
    "the resulting advective - spectral - mixed method relaxes the cfl restriction on the time step and ameliorates the numerical dissipation significantly .",
    "moreover , it maintains the mass conservation and shows the third - order accuracy against both grid spacing and time stepping when an explicit adams three - step method@xcite coupled with the piecewise cubic spline interpolation@xcite is implemented .",
    "the proposed advective - spectral - mixed method allows us to study the quantum dynamics of two identical particles in phase space .",
    "we will illustrate how the physical symmetry relation is naturally embedded in the wigner equation and preserved by the advective - spectral - mixed method .",
    "in fact , the effect of the pauli exclusion principle and the uncertainty principle can be shown directly in phase space by simulating the electron - electron scattering and a helium - like system .",

    "for example , at the initial stage , the missing two points needed in the three - step method can be obtained using both euler and midpoint methods with a relatively smaller time step in a prediction - correction manner .",

    "the time step is not restricted by the usual cfl condition , and thus large time steps are allowed .",
    "this may be the most notable feature of the method .",
