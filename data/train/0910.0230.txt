    "in the mssm , the higgs potential conserves charge & parity ( cp ) at tree level @xcite . beyond the latter",
    ", cp violation can manifest itself through complex yukawa couplings of the higgs bosons to ( s)fermions .",
    "there are several new parameters in the susy theory that are absent in the sm , which could well be complex and thus possess cp - violating phases .",
    "however , the cp - violating phases associated with the sfermions of the first and , to a lesser extent , second generations are severely constrained by bounds on the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the electron , neutron and muon @xcite@xcite .    by building on the results of refs .",
    "@xcite ( for the production ) and @xcite@xcite ( for the decay ) , we recently examined the lhc phenomenology of the @xmath4 process ( where @xmath3 labels the lightest neutral higgs state of the cp - violating mssm ) , which involves the ( leading ) direct effects of cp violation through couplings of the @xmath3 to sparticles in the loops as well as the ( subleading ) indirect effects through scalar - pseudoscalar mixing yielding the cp - mixed state @xmath3 . here",
    "we summarize the results of @xcite focussing especially on the effects of a light stop in the production of a cp - mixed @xmath3 by gluon fusion and its decay into two photons .",
    "explicit cp violation arises in the higgs sector of the mssm when various related couplings become complex . as a result , the physical higgs bosons are no more cp eigenstates , but a mixture of them .",
    "cp - violating effects in the combined production and decay process enter through :    1 .",
    "complex @xmath3-@xmath5-@xmath6 couplings at production level .",
    "2 .   complex @xmath3-@xmath5-@xmath6 couplings at decay level .",
    "3 .   mixing in the propagator .    the leading contribution to higgs production in gluon fusion",
    "is at the one loop level .",
    "similarly the leading contribution to di - photon decay channel is also at one loop level , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] .",
    "the propagator is considered in the following way .",
    "a cp - mixed higgs particle , @xmath7 , produced through gluon fusion , can be converted into another mass eigenstate , @xmath8 , through loops of fermion or gauge boson ( see fig . [",
    "fig : feyn ] ) .",
    "the lightest of the three @xmath8 states is taken to be @xmath3 here .",
    "this @xmath3 decays then through the di - photon channel .",
    "the propagator matrix is obtained from the self - energy of the higgs particles computed at one - loop level , where we used the expressions provided by @xcite which include off - diagonal absorptive parts .",
    "the matrix inversion required is done numerically using the lapack @xcite package .",
    "all the relevant couplings and masses are obtained from cpsuperh vesrsion 2 @xcite .",
    "cross section amplitude of the full process shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] , and the parton level cross section itself are then computed numerically .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that the only significant contribution to the cross section is made by the phase of a light stop in the decay loops .",
    "therefore , assuming a similar trend for the production mode also , we have considered a few sample parameter space points and studied the effect of cp violation , in particular the significance of a light stop in the loops , ignoring the effects of other sfermions , in order to illustrate the typical effects of cp - violation in the mssm .",
    "we fix the following mssm parameters which do not play a role in cp violation studies : + @xmath9 + we consider the case of all the third generation tri - fermion couplings being unified into one single quantity , @xmath10 .",
    "all the soft masses are taken to be at some unification scale , whose representative value adopted here is 1 tev .",
    "when considering the light stop case we take a comparatively light value for @xmath11 gev , which corresponds to a stop mass of around 200 gev , otherwise @xmath12 is set to 1 tev . in the higgs scalar - pseudoscalar coupling the product of @xmath13 and the sum of their phases is relevant rather than @xmath14 or @xmath10 separately .",
    "hence , we have kept @xmath15 and studied the effect of cp violation by varying @xmath1 alone . in our numerical analysis",
    "we have varied these parameters between 1 tev and 2 tev .",
    "@xmath16 is varied between 100 and 300 gev .",
    "the mass of the lightest higgs particle is then in the range of 100130 gev .",
    "it was noticed that only large @xmath17 case produce significant differences , so we take a representative value of @xmath18 to see the effect of the other parameters .",
    "in order to show the dependence on phase , we plotted a quantity @xmath19 , with @xmath20 being the difference in the magnitude of cross section for @xmath1 set to a given value and @xmath21 , and @xmath22 being the cross section for @xmath21 , in fig .  [ fig : tb20a1mu1phimu ] , against @xmath16 .",
    "we have considered @xmath23  tev and @xmath24  tev . clearly , there is appreciable variation of the cross section with @xmath1 . comparing the two cases of light and heavy stops ,",
    "it is clear that the higgs - stop - stop coupling is significant , with the difference in cross sections being noticably large with a light stop .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure [ fig : tb20a1mu1phimu3 ] illustrates similar studies with @xmath25 , @xmath23 @xmath26 ( left ) and @xmath24 tev , @xmath27 tev ( right ) , in particular showing how significantly the result depends on @xmath10 and @xmath14 . in general",
    ", we may expect the difference between the cp - conserving and cp - violating cases to depend quite sensitively on @xmath10 and @xmath14 , more so in the presence of a light stop .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the discovery of a light mssm higgs boson ( with mass below 130 gev or so ) at the lhc may eventually enable one to disentangle the cp - violating case from the cp - conserving one , so long that the relevant susy parameters entering @xmath28 are measured elsewhere , in particular @xmath29 .",
    "this is not phenomenologically unconceivable , as this higgs detection mode requires a very high luminosity , unlike the discovery of those sparticles ( and the measurement of their masses and couplings ) that enter the loops .",
