    "there are no constraints on the states , measurements , or the hilbert space .",
    "moreover , there is even no requirement that the system behaves identically and independently for each trial .",
    "in particular , the system could have an internal memory ( classical or quantum ) so that the results of the @xmath173th trial depend on the previous @xmath175 trials .",
    "we also note that there is a significant difference between the two - qubit scenario in ref . @xcite and our three - qubit scenario here . in the two - qubit case",

    "<S> here we assume an observed mabk violation lies within the interval @xmath46 with probability @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters are chosen as @xmath48 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the bound @xmath50 depends on the input probability distribution @xmath18 through the parameter @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the blue - square line represents the bound under a uniform distribution ( @xmath52 for all @xmath53 ) , while the red - dotted line shows the bound under a biased probability distribution with @xmath54 and @xmath55 with @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> it consumes less randomness to generate a biased distribution for the input bits , so the net amount of randomness , defined as the number of output random bits minus that of the input , becomes positive when @xmath17 is large ( typically @xmath17 needs to be of the order @xmath57 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inset ( b ) plots the net amount of randomness generated after @xmath17 trails under a biased distribution of the inputs . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters are the same as those in the inset ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> , width=332 ]    we now show how to generate and certify random numbers using majorana fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the key step is to generate a three - qubit entangled state and find suitable measurements that lead to violation of the mabk inequality . </S>",
    "<S> majorana fermions are non - abelian anyons , and their braiding gives nontrivial quantum operations . however , </S>",
    "<S> this set of operations are very restricted . </S>",
    "<S> first , all the gates generated by topological manipulation of majorana fermions belong to the clifford group , and it is impossible to use such operations alone to violate the chsh inequality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have to consider instead the multi - qubit mabk inequality . </S>",
    "<S> second , it is not obvious that one can violate the mabk inequality as well using only topological operations . </S>",
    "<S> there are two ways to encode a qubit using majorana fermions , using either two quasiparticles ( majorana fermions ) or four quasiparticles ( see the details in the supplement ) . in the two - quasiparticle encoding scheme , although the braiding gates exhaust the entire two - qubit clifford group , they can not span the whole clifford group for more than two qubits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , braiding majorana fermions within each qubit can not change the topological charge of this qubit which fixes the measurement basis . thus </S>",
    "<S> , no violation of the mabk inequality can be achieved using the topological operations alone in the two - quasiparticle encoding scheme . in the four - qusiparticle encoding scheme , it is not straightforward either as braidings in this scheme only allows certain single - qubit rotations and no entanglement can be obtained due to the no - entanglement rule proved already for this encoding scheme  2006bravyi .    </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , we can overcome this difficulty by taking advantage of the non - destructive measurement of the anyon fusion , which can induce qubit entanglement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in a real physical device , the anyon fusion can be read out non - destructively through the anyon interferometry 2010hassler . in the four - qusiparticle encoding scheme : each qubit is encoded by four majorana fermions , with the total topological charge @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit basis - states are represented by @xmath59 and @xmath60 . here </S>",
    "<S> , each @xmath61 represents a majorana fermion ; @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent the two possible fusion channels of a pair of majorana fermions , with @xmath62 standing for the vacuum state and @xmath63 denoting a normal fermion . as explained in the supplemental material , a topologically protected two - qubit cnot gate can be implemented using braidings together with non - destructive measurements of the anyon fusion  @xcite . to certify randomness through the mabk  inequality , we need to prepare a three - qubit entangled state . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we need in total fourteen majorana fermions , where twelve of them are used to encode three qubits and another ancillary pair is required for implementation of the effective cnot gates through measurement of the anyon fusion . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the logical state is @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> we apply first a hadamard gate on the qubit @xmath65 , which can be implemented through a series of anyon braiding as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> braidingsb , and then two effective cnot gates on the logical qubits @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the final state is the standard three - qubit maximally entangled state @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> after @xmath70 is generated , the three qubits can be separated and we need only local braiding and fusion of anyons within each qubit to perform the measurements in the appropriate bases to generate random numbers and certify them through test of the mabk  inequality .    to perform the measurements , we read out each qubit according to the input string @xmath71 through nondestructive detection of the anyon fusion . if the input is @xmath58 , we first braid the majorana fermions to implement a hadamard gate @xmath72 on this qubit ( as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ braidings]b ) , and then measure the fusion of the first two majorana fermions within each qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement outcome is @xmath58 ( @xmath65 ) if the fusion result is @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) . if the input is @xmath65 , we first braid the majorana fermions to implement a @xmath73 gate ( see fig .  [ braidings]a ) on this qubit before the same readout measurement . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , with the the input @xmath74 , we apply a hadamard gate to the first qubit and @xmath73 gates to the second and the third qubits , followed by the nondestructive measurement of fusion of the first two majorana fermions in each qubit . under the state @xmath70 , the conditional probability of the measurement outcomes @xmath75 under the measurement setting @xmath16 for these three qubits is give by @xmath76where @xmath77 and @xmath78 . with this conditional probability , we find the expected value of @xmath29 defined in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1,2 ) is @xmath79 , achieving the maximum quantum violation of the mabkinequality . </S>",
    "<S> all the steps for measurements and state preparation are based on the topologically protected operations such as anyon braiding or nondestructive detection of the anyon fusion , so the scheme here is intrinsically fault - tolerant and we should get the ideal value of @xmath79 if the majorana fermions can be manipulated at will in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> such a large violation perfectly certifies genuine randomness of the measurement outcomes .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 implements a unitary gate @xmath80 on the corresponding qubit . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) implementation of the hadamard gate through composition of anyon braiding . in both ( a ) and ( b ) , time flows from left to right and @xmath81 means equal up to an irrelevant overall phase . </S>",
    "<S> , width=321 ]    in summary , we have shown that genuine number numbers can be generated and certified through topologically manipulation of majorana fermions , a kind of anyonic excitations in engineered materials . </S>",
    "<S> such a protocol is intrinsically fault - tolerant . given the rapid experimental progress on realization of majorana fermions in real materials @xcite , this protocol offers a promising prospective for application of these topological particles in an important direction of cryptography with broad implications in science and engineering .    </S>",
