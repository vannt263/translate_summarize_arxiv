    "as discussed in recent papers  @xcite , the time - averaged expectation values of any observable are governed by the time - averaged density - matrix @xmath0 , which is diagonal in the final hamiltonian eigenstate basis , provided the spectrum is non - degenerate . from now on ,",
    "we only consider finite size systems that have a discrete spectrum .",
    "this leads to the so - called `` diagonal ensemble '' that has weights fully determined by the overlaps between the initial state @xmath8 and eigenstates @xmath9 of the final hamiltonian @xmath10 .",
    "usually , @xmath8 is the ground - state of the initial hamiltonian @xmath11 and we assume in the following that we start from this zero - temperature pure state .",
    "we also consider that the final hamiltonian takes the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( that has the dimension of an energy ) is called the quench amplitude , and @xmath14 is the dimensionless perturbing operator . working on a",
    "_ global _ quantum quench means that @xmath14 is assumed to be an extensive operator that scales with the number of particles @xmath15 .",
    "the time - averaged density - matrix is defined by @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "it is important to realize that the infinite time limit is taken before the thermodynamical limit .",
    "if the spectrum has exact degeneracies , the time - averaged density - matrix reads : @xmath18 where @xmath19 labels non - degenerate eigenstates of @xmath10 and @xmath20 are the diagonal weights .",
    "@xmath21 labels the basis of the degenerate subspaces , and the vectors @xmath22 keep a memory of the initial phases of @xmath8 with respect to the @xmath23 . in the situation where @xmath0 is block - diagonal , in order to get time - averaged results for an observable @xmath24 which has off - diagonal matrix elements in the @xmath10 eigenstate basis , one would have to compute all the overlaps @xmath25 and @xmath26 and sum up the contributions of all a degenerate subspace . in the following",
    ", this would be the case only for the free boson model and we will actually only use observables that are diagonal because the dimensions of the degenerate sectors grows ( roughly ) exponentially with the number of bosons @xmath15 . for the bose - hubbard model , one can check that the spectra are non - degenerate in each symmetry sector .    for a generic non - integrable model ,",
    "the `` eigenstate thermalization hypothesis '' ( eth ) has been surmised  @xcite , suggesting an explanation for thermalization in an isolated quantum system and a justification for the use of the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the eth is supported by semi - classical and random - matrix theory arguments  @xcite , and was checked numerically on particular models  @xcite .",
    "the eth boils down to the fact that , in a given small window of energy , the diagonal observables @xmath27 that contribute to the time - averaged expectation value @xmath28 = \\sum_{n } p_n \\mathcal{o}_n$ ] hardly depend on the eigenstate @xmath19 ( in short , @xmath29 in a small energy window ) .",
    "consequently , any distribution peaked around the mean energy , and one can show on general grounds that the relative width of the distribution scales to zero as @xmath30  @xcite ( although some slower scalings could occur  @xcite ) , will give the same observables as the microcanonical ensemble , therefore accounting for thermalization .",
    "for integrable models  @xcite , non - thermalization is explained from the fact that observables fluctuate a lot within a given energy window , which may be associated with the extensive number of conserved quantities that exist in these models .",
    "a more subtle scenario for the breakdown of the eth was recently proposed  @xcite , in which some `` rare '' states have a significant contribution to the averaged observables .",
    "we now describe how to get the diagonal weights for two particular models .",
    "firstly , we consider a model of @xmath15 non - interacting bosons initially confined in an harmonic trap of frequency @xmath31 and lying in the zero - temperature ground - state . the frequency is changed to @xmath32 at time @xmath33 . for this model ,",
    "the quench amplitude is defined as @xmath34 ( taking @xmath31 as the unit of energy ) , according to the expression of the quench parameter in terms of the harmonic oscillator ladder operators .",
    "we start with the computation of the single - particle wave - function overlaps @xmath35 since the results for the many - body wave - function will be expressed as a function of them .",
    "the single - particle spectrum is non - degenerate and the single - particle eigenfunctions are : @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 the hermite polynomials .",
    "the single - particle excitation spectrum is split into the odd and even parity sectors and the overlaps are non - zero for even - parity wave - functions only .",
    "they read : @xmath39 for integer @xmath19 .",
    "the many - body wave - function of an @xmath15-bosons excited configuration @xmath40 of the final hamiltonian @xmath10 ( with highest occupied level @xmath41 ) is : @xmath42 with @xmath43 the set of all permutations and @xmath44 the occupation of the single - particle orbital @xmath45 .",
    "overlapping this state with the @xmath15-bosons initial ground - state @xmath46 gives the many - body weights @xmath47 in this equation , all @xmath41 s are even integers .",
    "the total energy of this excitation is @xmath48 with the constraint @xmath49 .",
    "( [ eq : many - particle - weights ] ) is nothing but the multinomial distribution associated with the elementary probabilities @xmath50 and it is thus clear that it is normalized .",
    "we also see that formula  ( [ eq : many - particle - weights ] ) is in general valid for a free boson model , starting from the condensed ground - state ( and specifying the @xmath50 ) .",
    "if one takes the single - particle boltzmann factor for the @xmath50 , one recovers the many - body boltzmann factor for the configuration .",
    "contrary to statistical ensemble distributions , the weights do not show a simple dependence of the configuration energy .",
    "this quench is qualitatively similar to a joule compression / expansion as the 1d effective density @xmath51 suddenly changes .",
    "in fact , @xmath52 is related the ratio of the effective densities",
    ". other examples of quantum mechanical treatments of the joule expansion can be found in the literature  @xcite .    in order to get the distribution of the weights versus energy , we resort to numerics : using a fixed number of low - lying _ even parity _ levels @xmath53 , we scan all possible configurations of @xmath15 bosons in these @xmath53 levels iteratively up to roughly @xmath54 configurations ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) . the truncation error associated with a finite @xmath53",
    "is checked by summing up the weights .",
    "the bose - hubbard model in a one - dimensional lattice , known to be non - integrable for @xmath57 , is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath58           + \\frac{u}{2 } \\sum_j n_j(n_j-1)\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath59 the operator creating a boson at site @xmath60 and @xmath61 the local density .",

    "the critical point has been located at @xmath65 using numerics  @xcite .",
    "the quenches are performed by changing the interaction parameter @xmath66 ( we set @xmath67 as the unit of energy in the following ) , so we have @xmath68 , and the perturbing operator @xmath69 is diagonal .",
    "numerically , one must fix a maximum onsite occupancy @xmath2 and we take @xmath70 unless stated otherwise .",
    "exact diagonalization calculations are carried out using periodic boundary conditions and translational invariance .",
    "we denote by @xmath71 the total momentum symmetry sectors .",
    "the algorithm to get the ground - state and eigenstates of the hamiltonian is a full diagonalization scheme for sizes up to @xmath72 at unitary filling .",
    "for some of the quantities , we use the lanczos algorithm up to @xmath73 . in ref .",
    ", the lanczos algorithm has been proposed to compute the low - energy weights of the distribution .",
    "this worked relatively well for the 1d bhm , and in particular for the spectrum - integrated quantities but it may not be suited for all possible kind of quenches .",
    "we notice that in the case of quenches with a mean energy deep in the bulk of the spectrum , a generalization of the lanczos algorithm  @xcite that works in the bulk of a spectrum could be used to get the main weights . for what we call",
    "small quenches in the following , the larger weights are in the low - energy region so lanczos can generically give good results in such situations .",
    "the goal of this part is to quantify the distance of the quench distribution @xmath1 from the many - body ground - state and the low - energy region of the spectrum .",
    "a first distance is defined from an energetic argument and a second one from the overlap with the ground - state of @xmath10 .",
    "both criteria leads to a crossover number of bosons @xmath74 that can be computed numerically and that diverge with small @xmath13 as a power - law . when @xmath75 , the quench probes the low - energy part of the spectrum while when @xmath76 , high - energy physics govern the time - evolution .",
    "both definitions do not depend on the integrability of the model but we may argue that for non - integrable models , there is a strong qualitative difference between the low - energy part of the spectrum and the bulk of the spectrum .",
    "these finite - size effects are rather generic while other kind of finite - size effects can emerge for a given model : this will be for instance the case for the bhm at large @xmath4 .       and @xmath77 .",
    "energies are given as a function of the total momentum @xmath78 .",
    "the width of the spectrum is typically proportional to @xmath15 or @xmath79 depending on the statistics .",
    "zooms in the low - energy region and in the bulk of the spectrum ( grey region ) are given .",
    "the low - energy region features elementary excitations up to a typical energy scale @xmath80 which is assumed to be microscopic , i.e. non - extensive . here",
    ", we take @xmath81 and the relation dispersion of the excitation branch is sketch ( the line is a guide to the eyes ) . ]",
    "_ the low - energy part of the spectrum _  we first have to specify what we mean by the low - energy region of the spectrum : it corresponds to the typical energies of a few elementary excitations above the ground - state .",
    "these elementary excitations are quasi - particles , collectives modes , particle - hole excitations  single or few excitations give a structure ( dispersion relations , continuum of low - lying excitations ) to the low - energy part of the many - body spectrum ( see an example in fig .",
    "[ fig : generic_spectrum ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath80 the typical energy scale of a single excitation , it is a _ microscopic _ energy scale . in bethe - ansatz",
    "solvable or free systems , a high energy excitation can be understood as a superposition of single - particle excitations while this is no longer true for non - integrable systems  @xcite .",
    "if the number of elementary excitations remains small enough , they may hardly interact and have integrable - like features in the low - energy part of the spectrum .",
    "we thus expect a smooth crossover between integrable - like and non - integrable like behaviors with increasing the energy above the ground - state , but the typical energy of this crossover is hard to evaluate , except that it must be above @xmath82 .",

    "the criteria we choose to distinguish between low - energy ( or small ) quenches and high - energy ( or large ) quenches is @xmath93 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch ] ) where @xmath85 is such that @xmath94 with the ground - state energy @xmath84 .",
    "it corresponds to the situation where the mean - energy put into the system excites roughly only one elementary excitation and is thus a finite - size effect .",
    "another way to introduce the same criteria is the following : @xmath95 is the energy difference between the initial state and the final ground - state in units of the typical elementary excitation energy @xmath80 , the criteria corresponding to a distance of one @xmath80   is different from the finite size gap to the first excitation ( there can be a huge number of states between @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) . ] .",
    "the criteria thus amounts to a lower bond of the energies at which one enters in the bulk of the spectrum .",
    "the order of magnitude of @xmath80 is set by the microscopic units of energy of the model .",
    "for instance , we ll take @xmath96 in the bhm as it controls the sound velocity in the superfluid region and the mott gap in the mott phase .",
    "this criteria gives a relation between the crossover number of particles @xmath88 ( on a lattice we work at finite density so it also corresponds to a crossover length @xmath97 ) and the quench amplitude @xmath13 is such that , if @xmath98 , the energy is mostly distributed among the low - energy excitations while if @xmath99 , most of the weights are on high - energy excitations .",
    "we can rewrite the criteria in a more tractable way : using the notation @xmath100 for the energy per particle , and the label @xmath101 for ground - state energies , it reads @xmath102 interestingly , we expect @xmath74 to generically diverge as @xmath103 in the limit of small @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath104 with @xmath105 , the expansion @xmath106 , and @xmath107 after feynman - hellman theorem . with eq .",
    "( [ eq : general_ham ] ) , one finally gets @xmath108 at @xmath109 .    a few comments can be made on the criteria :    * when comparing quenches from the same initial state but with different @xmath10 , @xmath13 controls the mean energy per particle put into the system .",
    "thus , @xmath13 is a meaningful parameter even in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "* this definition looks qualitative due to the rather arbitrary choice of @xmath80 and to the fact that , on finite systems , the energy distribution can have a rather large width associated with energy fluctuations @xmath110 .",
    "we point out that @xmath88 is a crossover number so that @xmath111 has no particular meaning .",
    "furthermore , from the divergence at small @xmath13 , one can have @xmath112 , i.e. a situation where energy fluctuations vanish . * when @xmath13 is scanned from @xmath101 to a finite value ,",
    "both the mean energy and the region of the spectrum that plays a role in the time - evolution ( around @xmath113 ) are continuously changed .",
    "one can also notice that a quench that starts from a ground - state does not necessarily allow to access any energy of the @xmath10 spectrum , contrary to the situation where one prepares the initial state at will .",
    "* the regimes @xmath76 and @xmath75 are expected to be physically different for generic ( non - integrable ) systems .",
    "below @xmath80 , the density of states is usually much smaller than in the bulk of the spectrum : level spacings are of order of @xmath114 and observables can strongly fluctuate with the eigenstate number as it can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : observables_g1 ] and [ fig : observables_nk0 ] ( similar observations can be made in the figures of refs .  ) . in this low - energy region",
    ", rmt arguments are not expected to work  @xcite and the eigenstates may not be `` typical '' so we expect the eth to fail .",
    "these qualitative observations support the difference between the low - energy region and the high - energy region of the spectrum made at the beginning of this section . +",
    "as the full spectrum width grows as @xmath15 or @xmath79 ( depending on the statistics of the particles ) while the number of eigenstates grows exponentially with @xmath15 , the density of states in the bulk of the spectrum is exponentially large . in this `` high - energy '' regime ( with respect to elementary excitations ) , semi - classical and rmt arguments are believed to work reasonably well for _ non - integrable _ models  @xcite , which was checked on some strongly correlated systems  @xcite . as observed numerically on several examples  @xcite , simple observables hardly depend on the eigenstate number in this regime , supporting the eth . * in the thermodynamical limit , we always have @xmath76 and the small quench regime is thus expected to vanish . if one wants to check the eth on a finite size systems , one needs sufficiently large @xmath13 in order to try to reach the bulk of the spectrum",
    ". however , we will see in this paper a counter - example ( the bhm ) where eth fails at large @xmath13 ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "even though it looks difficult to use quenches to probe very low - energy excitations in a very large system , on a finite system , one could tune the mean energy from the low to high energy part of the spectrum using @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , this small quench regime is certainly of interest for numerical simulations , and also for experiments using a relatively small number of atoms ( few hundreds or thousands ) . *",
    "lastly , it could be interesting to compare this criteria with the domain of validity of bosonization  @xcite and conformal field theory  @xcite but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we note that conformal field theory can describe accurately quenches in certain integrable models in the thermodynamical limit and for arbitrary quench amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "non - integrable models low - energy features that are described in terms of a free particles ( integrable ) theory , as bosonization , should display non - thermalized features as for integrable models . in this respect , ref .",
    "gives interesting examples on the applicability of these methods to the quench situation .",
    "we now give examples of @xmath74 for the two models under study . in the free boson model , the mean",
    "energy after the quench can be computed analytically : @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
    "the energy fluctuations are given by @xmath117 , showing that the distribution gets peaked in the thermodynamical limit with the usual scaling .",
    "a natural choice for @xmath80 is @xmath118 ( the only microscopic energy scale ) and the crossover number of bosons can be expressed as a function of the quench amplitude : @xmath119 this expression diverges as @xmath120 in the small quench regime and vanishes as @xmath121 in the large quench regime .     obtained from the energetic argument in the 1d bhm at filling @xmath64 and starting from @xmath122 .",

    "it displays the expected @xmath103 divergence at small quenches .",
    "we notice that the finite size effects on this energy - based criteria are pretty small .",
    "this can be put on general grounds for 1d systems : for critical systems the finite - size effects on the ground - state energy per particles have a universal correction  @xcite : @xmath125 with @xmath126 the sound velocity and @xmath127 the central charge .",
    "if the system is gapped , the corrections are even smaller as they are exponentially suppressed , by a factor @xmath128 with @xmath129 the correlation length enters in the formula . in the large quench limit of the bhm",
    ", one can argue that @xmath88 saturates to a finite value .",
    "indeed , in the limit of large @xmath13 , one finds that @xmath130 , as the density fluctuations @xmath131 are suppressed in the mott phase .",
    "notice that the energy fluctuations , that scale as @xmath30 in the 1d bhm , have been computed numerically in ref .  .",

    "this surprising behavior ( diverging with the number of bosons ) actually agrees with the exact scaling of the single - particle ground - state occupation number which can be computed for the quench since we have seen that the distribution is the multinomial one : we have @xmath166 at large @xmath13 .",

    "the physical origin of the fact that the quench process makes it difficult to reach the critical temperature is that the many - body ground - state has vanishing overlaps with the excited states above @xmath156 because they have negligible contributions from the single - particle ground - state . starting from a finite temperature state ,",

    "dmrg calculations  @xcite gave evidence that a non - thermal correlations @xmath216 survive for system sizes of order 100 .",
    "we now elucidate the origin of the observed non - thermalized regime , first by looking at the effect of the commensurability of the density in order to determine whether the presence of an equilibrium critical point plays a role for large quenches . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : incommensurate ] and [ fig : incommensurate_corr ] , the phenomenology is very similar to the commensurate case with a non - thermalized regime at large quenches , except that there is no gap above the ground - state .",
    "quenches that remain in the superfluid region ( data not shown ) also have the same behavior as for the commensurate case .",
    "these results suggest that the reason for non - thermalization is not related to the features of the low - energy spectrum , i.e. to the presence of a gap above the ground - state , but is related to the proximity of the @xmath229 limit of the model .",
    "however , in the small quench regime where the low - energy part of the spectrum governs the out - of - equilibrium physics , the opening of a gap can certainly play a role . unfortunately ,",
    "due to the finite size effects discussed in this paper , this interesting question can not be addressed with reliability .",
    "for instance , it has been shown recently  @xcite that a quench in the quantum ising model , which is integrable , is sensitive to the presence of the critical point .",
    "we note that the lobes could be qualitatively interpreted as stemming from a 1d gapped single - particle dispersion relation both in the commensurate and incommensurate regimes .",

    "one can actually argue that the large-@xmath4 structure of the distribution is reminiscent of the atomic limit @xmath229 in which we show that both the weights and the observables fluctuate and are correlated so that eth is violated in this limit .",
    "what one can show is that the weights of a quench from @xmath231 to @xmath232 depend on the configuration in each of the degenerated mott peaks of the @xmath232 limit .",
    "this argument does not rely on the @xmath64 commensurability condition .",
    "indeed , the eigenstates of the final hamiltonian are simply the set of configurations @xmath233 with @xmath44 the onsite occupations .",
    "the energy per particle of the configuration is @xmath234 the initial ground - state is the superfluid state that has equal single - particle probabilities @xmath235 on each site . using formula  ( [ eq : many - particle - weights ] ) , we get for the diagonal weights : @xmath236 this makes a connection to the free boson model that we also study , having the @xmath96 energy spacing between the degenerate levels instead of @xmath118 and a different energy - configuration relation .",
    "the formula is valid for bare configurations , i.e. when they are not symmetrized . using symmetries , formula  ( [ eq : many - particle - weights - largeu ] ) picks up an additional factor depending on the degeneracy of the generalized bloch state .",
    "one can see by taking an example of two configurations with the same energy , or check numerically , that the weights can be different for configurations with the same energy , in the same way as for the free boson model .",
    "consequently , in a strongly degenerate mott peak , the diagonal weights are not equal and fluctuate .",
    "as soon as a non - integrable perturbation ( here the hopping @xmath62 ) is turned on and lifts the degeneracy , the distribution of the weights will still strongly fluctuate within the mott lobe .",
    "this explains the findings of refs .   and of fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_ensembles ] .",
    "another simple observation in this limit is that two degenerate configurations can have different expectation values for the observables .",
    "an obvious one is the onsite particle distribution that counts empty , single , double occupations and so on .",
    "the off - diagonal correlation @xmath216 can be non - zero if the configurations are symmetrized and one can check numerically that they actually strongly differ for degenerate states .",
    "notice that , in principle , one has to take into account the off - diagonal part of the time - averaged density - matrix that is non - zero in this highly degenerate limit .",
    "when one turns on @xmath62 , this off - diagonal part vanishes and the @xmath216 still fluctuate strongly for eigenstates close in energy .",

    "the fate of this explanation in the thermodynamical limit is yet an open question .",
    "a scenario could be that this mechanism works above a certain critical quench amplitude @xmath242 but how this critical value behaves as @xmath160 remains a difficult question .",

    "[ fig : observables_g1 ] and  [ fig : observables_nk0 ] that eth could work since the observables behave smoothly with @xmath185 in the final hamiltonian .",

    "we now briefly discuss the evolution of the distribution for the free boson model for a fixed number of bosons and increasing @xmath13 .",
    "very surprisingly , the distribution of the single - particle weights versus single - particle energies @xmath244 has some remarkable features ( we recall that only the even levels can be occupied from symmetry reasons ) . in the limit of large energy @xmath245",

    "this distribution finally develops a high - energy tail for large @xmath13 .",
    "one can compute analytically the third moment @xmath249 which is non - zero and scales as @xmath15 showing that the distribution remains anisotropic and that the anisotropy @xmath250 decreases as @xmath251 . in order to compare the distributions from different ensembles",
    ", we use the von - neumann entropy of a density - matrix @xmath252 which is defined as @xmath253 $ ] .",
    "contrary to observables , this quantity is more sensitive to the tail of the distribution .",
    "@xmath254 for the boltzmann and diagonal ensembles are shown in fig .",

    "the density - matrix @xmath255 is a boltzmann distribution but restricted to the even parity levels only .",
    "we see that for small quenches , @xmath256 and @xmath257 are very close .",
    "the larger entropy for @xmath258 is simply due to the fact that half of the hilbert space is not accessible to @xmath0 for symmetry reasons : @xmath256 and @xmath258 are actually the same up to a factor 2 in the energy . comparing the data to the microcanonical entropy is not relevant here because of finite size effects ( energy discretization and small degeneracy of the first levels ) for the values of the mean energy accessible here .    , full lines for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) . ]",
    "the first conclusion we would like to highlight is that , when carrying out numerical simulations on a finite system , one has to care both about the quench amplitude and the size of the system to see in which region of the spectrum are the main weights of the diagonal ensemble distribution .",
    "it has been shown that , although the low - energy part of the spectrum is the place where the most interesting physics is expected , one experiences large finite size effects when exploring it .",
    "a crossover number of particles , distinguishing between the small quench regime and the large quench regime , can be tentatively defined from energetic considerations or from the static fidelity between the ground - states of the initial and final hamiltonians .",
    "one advantage is that they can be computed numerically with few finite size effects ( for the energy based criteria ) or with ground - state techniques that work on larger systems ( for both criteria ) .",
    "the numbers have been computed for the two models under study . as the system follows a finite size crossover between the two regimes",
    ", it can actually happen to be difficult for nowadays numerics to be close enough to the thermodynamical limit , where eth is expected to work generically , even though some examples can be found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "this actually is what happens for the one - dimensional bose - hubbard model as we have seen .",
    "hence , the thermalization - like regime in the small quench limit deduced from observables comparison and the qualitative boltzmann - like structure of the distribution can not be considered as truly thermalized because of dominant finite size effects .",
    "furthermore , sizes accessible with full diagonalization can not reach the bulk of the energy spectrum before the structure of the spectrum resembles the infinite-@xmath4 atomic limit .",
    "the free boson model nicely illustrates the crossover from a boltzmann - like distribution , up to phase space constraints , at small quench to a different distribution .",
    "we note that due to the large density of states and to negligible energy fluctations , we may expect the quench , canonical and microcanonical distributions to eventually be equivalent in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "however , we have discussed the fact that the smaller the mean - energy ( or equivalently the temperature ) , the larger are finite - size effects .",
    "we do not believe that the observed finite - size and canonical - like distributions at small quenches are generic ( notice that no claim in that direction was made in ref .  ) and they may better be simply understood as ( counter-)examples .",
    "the second important conclusion is that we have shown that the non - thermalized regime observed _ on finite systems _ for large quenches in the 1d bose - hubbard model is actually related to the proximity of the @xmath229 atomic limit , something that may qualitatively be equivalent to the proximity of an integrable point .",
    "indeed , this regime does not depend on the low - energy features at a commensurate density , i.e. to the presence of the superfluid - mott transition , and besides , the structure of the diagonal ensemble stems from the @xmath259 quench limit of the bose - hubbard model . in non - integrable models ,",
    "the challenging issues on what are the features of the small quench regime for very large sizes and how the non - thermalized regime neighboring an integrable point survive in the thermodynamical regime seem to be hardly accessible to current numerical algorithms .",

    "<S> other methods have been used to tackle the physics of quenches . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , `` ab - initio '' numerics have been used on both integrable and non - integrable models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> numerical methods like time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group ( tdmrg )  @xcite can be used to compute the time - evolution of the wave - function but the interpretation is restricted to observables and to a finite window of time , and can not give access the these weights . </S>",
    "<S> exact results on integrable models  @xcite have the advantage to treat in a non - perturbative way large systems , but on the other hand , it is not surprising that they do not always thermalize due to the extensive number of conserved quantities . </S>",
    "<S> luttinger liquid theory , which describes the low - energy physics of one - dimensional models in terms of free bosonic fields ( thus an integrable theory ) , has been used to compute the time - evolution of the observables  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantum chaos methods have also helped studying the time - evolution of the bose - hubbard model  @xcite . some studies focused on the relation between fidelity and on the energy distribution  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these methods suffer from approximations and/or finite size effects and it is sometimes hard to determine what is an artifact or not .    </S>",
    "<S> some of the results from numerical simulations seems to be contradictory  @xcite but were carried out on different models with different range of parameters , and not necessarily starting from the ground - state  @xcite of a simply related hamiltonian . performing a quantum quench amounts </S>",
    "<S> to projecting an initial state onto the energy spectrum of the final hamiltonian , corresponding to a certain distribution of energy @xmath1 . in the thermodynamical limit , a global quench </S>",
    "<S> is expected to drive the mean energy to the bulk of the energy spectrum since the perturbing operator is extensive . in this high energy domain </S>",
    "<S> , semi - classical physics and random - matrix theory arguments are expected to work and make expectation values hardly depend on the energy ( within a window given by the energy fluctuations )  @xcite : thermalization can occur in the sense that the energy distribution obtained from the quench gives the same averages for the observables as the microcanonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> this so - called `` eigenstates thermalization hypothesis '' ( eth ) has been tested numerically  @xcite for given models ( typically fermionic and hard - core bosonic models ) and some given set of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> no memory of the initial state ( for a given mean energy ) is thus found on simple observables . </S>",
    "<S> these results agree well with the previous findings of ref .   on a similar model . </S>",
    "<S> having in mind this qualitative argument , the results of ref .   on the non - integrable one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) </S>",
    "<S> look rather counter - intuitive : for small quenches , a thermalized regime was found in the sense that two independent observables computed within a ( grand)-canonical ensemble ( and not microcanonical ) and from time - evolution gave the same results . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , a mean - field treatment of the 1d bhm interpreted in the framework of chaos theory  @xcite supports non - thermalization below an interaction threshold and thermalization above ( mean - field theory is however known to fail for this strongly - correlated model so the results are not under control ) . </S>",
    "<S> the findings of ref .   </S>",
    "<S> were later supported by the calculation of the diagonal ensemble distributions which looked like an _ approximate _ boltzmann law  @xcite in the small quench regime . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , for large quenches , a non - thermalized regime was found in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> in which the correlations bear a strong memory of the initial state ( in the sense that they are closer to the ones in the initial state than to the thermalized ones ) . </S>",
    "<S> this non - equilibrium behavior was attributed to the very peculiar shape of the diagonal ensemble in this regime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important step towards the understanding of the non - thermalized regime on finite size systems was made very recently  @xcite by giving numerical evidences on the 1d bhm that eth does not apply for large quenches in finite systems and suggesting a general framework in terms of rare events contributing to the distribution , providing a refined version of the eth .    </S>",
    "<S> as integrability is often one of the ingredients that play a role in the physics of quenches , we briefly recall that , for 1d quantum many - body models , integrability can be well defined for a class of models which have the property of scattering without diffraction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has two consequences that are in relation with the question of thermalization : the momenta of the particles do not redistribute  @xcite ( a process which is believed to be essential to get the thermalized momentum distribution ) , and there is an extensive number of conserved quantities that separate the eigenstates in many sectors , constraining the time evolution . in the context of nuclear physics </S>",
    "<S> , random - matrix theory has been proposed to describe the statistical features of the bulk of the spectrum and it is commonly conjectured that non - integrable quantum many - body or classically chaotic models display universal level statistics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> level statistics have been computed in a few many - body models  @xcite , supporting the conjecture , but these results are restricted to a few models and it can not be excluded that diffractive models could display non - universal level statistics . the bose - hubbard model is a bit peculiar in this sense : if one denotes by @xmath2 the maximum number of bosons onsite , the model is non - diffractive only for @xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , if @xmath4 is the interaction strength , @xmath5 is an integrable point ( the atomic limit @xmath6 is as well exactly solvable ) . </S>",
    "<S> level statistics and delocalization properties of the eigenstates have shown  @xcite that the bhm display features of quantum chaotic systems for non - zero @xmath4 ( and larger @xmath2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the first goal of this paper is to discuss the crossover from small to large quench amplitude regimes on the basis of energetic and static fidelity arguments , and to evaluate the finite size effects that are associated to this crossover . </S>",
    "<S> we then turn to a detailed discussion of the diagonal ensemble and the verification of the eth in the bhm , complementary to what has been done in refs .   and . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the observed boltzmann - like regime is spoiled by strong finite size effects that prevent both an accurate definition of an effective temperature and the comparison with the microcanonical ensemble . in the large quench limit </S>",
    "<S> , we explain in details that the breakdown of the eth is actually related to the `` integrable '' quench limit @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , non - thermalization in the 1d bhm is , on finite systems , reminiscent of the atomic limit . </S>",
    "<S> while the @xmath5 limit of the bose - hubbard model is trivially integrable as a free boson model , the infinite @xmath4 ( or atomic ) limit is a bit particular : for very large @xmath4 _ and _ focusing on the _ low - energy _ part of the spectrum , the model is effectively identical to an integrable 1d hard - core bosons model ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we will see that , to understand the large-@xmath4 limit of the quench , we will have to consider the whole excitation spectrum and not only the low - energy part . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be qualitatively and partially connected to the effect of the proximity to integrable points in quantum quenches , studied very recently in fermionic and hard - core bosonic models  @xcite , in the sense that the observed non - thermalized regime _ on finite systems _ is connected to a particular limit in which the model has high degeneracies . throughout the paper </S>",
    "<S> , we also give a simple but interesting example of a quench in a toy model consisting of free bosons confined in an harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation for it is that it surprisingly shares some qualitative features with the 1d bhm and that it allows for analytical calculations on some properties of the diagonal ensemble distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this model also corresponds to a standard experimental setup ( so for the bhm ) although interactions would have to be taken into account for a realistic comparison .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows : we first review in sec .  [ sec : model ] the definitions of the time - averaged density - matrix , the eth and the computation of the diagonal weights for the two models under study . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : finitesize ] , we suggest two kinds of crossover number of particles to distinguish the small and large quench regimes . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we discuss in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : thermalization ] the fate of the eth in the 1d bhm and on small finite size systems . </S>"
