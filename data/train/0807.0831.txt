    "it is known that two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , in general , and minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , in particular , predict the existence of a charged scalar particle as well as two neutral scalar particles in addition to the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson [ 1 ] .",
    "experimental observations of these particles could be indirect indication of susy .",

    "the tevatron cdf excludes masses of a charged higgs boson below @xmath9 and @xmath10 gev for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , by searching @xmath13 decays [ 3 ] .",
    "obviously , higher energy reach of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will give opportunity to search charged higgs boson in wider mass region .",
    "the production of the charged higgs boson at the lhc for three sm generation case is considered in a number of papers [ 4 - 9 ] .",
    "on the other hand , flavor democracy , which is quite natural in the sm framework , predicts the existence of the fourth generation ( see review [ 10 ] and references therein ) .",
    "the masses of the fourth generation quarks and charged leptons are expected to be almost degenerate with preferable range of @xmath14 gev .",
    "obviously , the fourth generation quarks in this mass region will be observed at the first few years of the lhc data taking [ 11 - 14 ] .",
    "naturally , as the tevatron searches @xmath15 in @xmath16-quark decays , the lhc may do the same in @xmath17-quark decays .    in this paper",

    "the production of the charged higgs boson at the lhc via gluon - gluon fusion process @xmath1 , followed by @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays with subsequent @xmath4 , as well as the sm background is studied in section iii .",
    "the statistical significance of the charged higgs boson signal at the lhc is estimated assuming three @xmath0-quark jets to be tagged . finally , concluding remarks are made in section iv .",
    "interactions involved charged higgs boson can be described as below [ 6 ] : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the generation index and @xmath20 is defined as ratio of the two higgs doublets vacuum expectation values . applying the flavor democracy to three generation mssm result in @xmath21 [ 10 ] , whereas @xmath22 is preferable in four generation case .",

    "this background is potentially much larger than the signal .",
    "however , in order to extract the charged higgs boson signal and to suppress the sm background , we impose some kinematic cuts . in addition , we assume that three @xmath0-quark jets are tagged .",
    "we choose the following set of selection cuts : @xmath35 gev for all the jets and the lepton , excluding @xmath36 gev cut for at least one of @xmath0-jets ; @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes pseudorapidity ; a minimum separation of @xmath39^{1/2}\\:>\\:0.4 $ ] ( @xmath40 is the azimuthal angle ) between the lepton and the jets as well as each pair of jets .",
