    "therefore , there exists a map @xmath230 which keeps track of @xmath215-tuples of points in @xmath179 on which the polynomials @xmath190 vanish .",
    "it was mentioned before that the condition for a polynomial to vanish at a given point , determines an affine hyperplane in @xmath170 . by the remark to lemma  [ vdm ] , any set of @xmath215 points in @xmath179 with @xmath229 ,",
    "determines a set of hyperplanes in general position , hence their intersection has complex codimension @xmath215 in @xmath170 .",

    "it is also obvious that the maps @xmath253 and @xmath254 in ( [ eq3 ] ) induce the identity map in this strip .",
    "the fact that for @xmath220 $ ] the homomorphism of the @xmath258-terms induced by @xmath255 is identity as well , follows from the explicit description of the filtration on @xmath250 obtained above ; essentially this is just the thom isomorphism .    due to the action of the differentials which connect the stable and the unstable parts of the spectral sequence , the stable region for the terms",
    "@xmath259 is smaller than that for the term @xmath258 .",

    "hence , we obtain    the map @xmath265 induced by the stabilization map is an isomorphism for all @xmath266 + 1\\right).\\ ] ]    together with proposition  [ th : real ] this implies theorem  [ the ] .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ free ] consists in applying theorem  [ the ] fibrewise to the map @xmath267 induced by restriction to a hyperplane . in what follows",
    "we denote by @xmath268 the stabilization dimension @xmath269 + 1\\right)$ ] .",

    "a comparison of the spectral sequences for both fibrations shows that the inclusion @xmath273 induces isomorphisms in homology in dimensions smaller than @xmath268 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to prove that the inclusion @xmath274 is an isomorphism on homology in these dimensions .",
    "according to theorem  [ the ] , the fibres of the map @xmath275 have the same homology as @xmath21 in dimensions smaller than @xmath268",

    "the space @xmath28 is a complement to a discriminant in a complex projective space ; the homogeneous coordinates in this projective space are the coefficients of the polynomials representing a point in @xmath28 . from this point of view , the map @xmath275 is just a linear projection . blowing up the indeterminacy locus of this projection one gets the variety @xmath56 ; the variety @xmath127 is just a complex projective space .",
    "there exist stratifications on @xmath56 and @xmath127 , with @xmath28 being the maximal stratum of @xmath56 , which turn @xmath282 into a stratified map , see section  i.1.7 of @xcite .",
    "take @xmath278 to be the filtration on @xmath272 produced by intersecting @xmath272 with the above stratification of @xmath127 .",
    "it follows from thom s first isotopy lemma ( see i.1.5 of @xcite ) that @xmath275 is a fibration over each component of @xmath277 .",
    "the second part of the lemma follows from the fact that every stratified set has a triangulation compatible with the stratification .",
    "the inclusion @xmath284 is a morphism of fibrations over the same base .",
    "hence , by theorem  [ the ] , it induces isomorphisms of homology groups in dimensions less than @xmath268 .",

    "( notice that @xmath287 is contractible and that @xmath290 is a fibration . ) comparing it to the analogous mayer - vietoris sequence with @xmath275 replaced by @xmath107 , one verifies that the homomorphisms @xmath291 are isomorphisms for @xmath292 .",
    "now , to finish the proof of theorem  [ free ] , compare the spectral sequences associated to the filtrations @xmath293 on @xmath294 , and @xmath279 on @xmath28 .",
    "the estimate for the stabilization dimension in theorem  [ the ] in the case @xmath226 is weaker than the estimate given by segal s theorem . it is probable that lemma  [ vdm ] on which our estimate is based , can be replaced by a stronger statement .",
    "however , the methods of the present paper are sufficient to recover segal s theorem , at least for @xmath295 . in the case",
    "@xmath226 , @xmath227 the simplicial resolution @xmath296 is , in fact , non - degenerate , as a polynomial of degree @xmath30 in one variable can have at most @xmath30 roots .",
    "thus the explicit description of @xmath234 as a thom space of a bundle over a configuration space is valid not only for @xmath220 $ ] , but for all @xmath229 .",
    "this leads to a better estimate for the stabilization dimension .",
    "there is no doubt that theorem  [ the ] can be also strengthened by replacing `` homology '' with `` homotopy '' in the case @xmath297 .",

    "such an argument , however , is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
