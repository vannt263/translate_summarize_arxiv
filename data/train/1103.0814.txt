    "a realistic model of the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) is needed for various applications , such as direct dark matter searches , studies of cosmic rays , and others .",
    "in particular , the gmf plays a crucial role in the propagation of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs)those with energies in excess of @xmath1  ev . their deflections ( assuming these are charged particles ) in the gmf are large enough to prevent the identification of some , perhaps most sources directly from the uhecr data .",
    "however , in the case of protons these deflections are sufficiently small to be corrected for , provided the gmf is known with enough accuracy .",
    "thus , the possibility of astronomy with charged particles at ultra - high energies may depend crucially on our knowledge of the gmf .    the magnetic field ( mf ) of our galaxy",
    "is thought to contain both regular and turbulent components ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . while the regular component is subdominant in strength by a factor of a few , it is expected to give a dominant contribution in integral quantities such as total deflections of ultra - high energy particles . unlike the turbulent component",
    ", the regular component adds up coherently and comes to dominate @xcite when integrated over many coherence lengths . estimating the strength and global structure of the regular mf of our galaxy is the main purpose of this paper .",
    "our primary interest is on mf outside the thin galactic disk , since that is the field that determines the deflections for most arrival directions of uhecrs .",
    "the regular component of the gmf has been studied previously e.g. @xcite , and in particular in the context of uhecr propagation @xcite .",
    "the advance of this paper is that it is based on improved data on rotation measures ( rms ) and the ionized gas distribution .",
    "we also develop improved numerical model commensurate with this improved data .",
    "observations of other spiral galaxies reveal mfs of a few @xmath2 g strength , coherent over distances of several kiloparsecs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations from the face - on and edge - on perspectives indicate that these fields consist of at least two components : the disk one which is concentrated towards the galactic plane and has largely a spiral pattern , and the halo one that resides at some distance from the disk plane and has radial size comparable with the size of the galaxy . as the milky way seems to be a typical member of the entire class of spiral galaxies , mfs of similar strength and configuration",
    "should be expected in our galaxy .",
    "there are several methods to estimate the mf in the galaxy , such as zeeman splitting measurements @xcite , infrared polarization studies @xcite , synchrotron polarization and intensity surveys @xcite , starlight polarization studies @xcite and , finally , observation of the faraday rms of different galactic ( pulsars ) and extragalactic radio sources ( e.g.r.s . )",
    "except for the zeeman measurements all these methods are somewhat indirect as they involve additional assumptions such as density of warm ionized medium or concentrations of cosmic ray electrons . in this paper",
    "we use recent data on the faraday rms .",
    "when propagating through a magnetized plasma , the polarization plane of a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave of wavelength @xmath3 rotates by the angle @xmath4 proportional to the square of the wavelength , @xmath5 multi - frequency observations thus allow one to measure the value of rm .",
    "the rm can be expressed in terms of the properties of the intergalactic / interstellar medium ( igm / ism ) and permeating mfs : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the density of free electrons measured in @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the component of the mf parallel to the line of sight measured in @xmath2 g ( positive when directed towards the observer ) , and @xmath10 is the distance from the observer to the source in pc . combined with data on the galactic free electron distribution , equations  ( [ rm1 ] ) and ( [ rm2 ] ) can be used to estimate the gmf from the faraday rms of a large number of sources .",
    "two types of sources are normally used to measure galactic faraday rotation : galactic pulsars and extragalactic radio sources .",
    "pulsars have an advantage that their _ intrinsic _ rm values are negligibly small .",
    "however , the use of pulsars requires the knowledge of their distances ( usually inferred from their dispersion measures dm ) , which introduces additional assumptions about the ism density distribution . in addition , pulsars are concentrated around the galactic plane , and their total number ( @xmath11 ) is currently much smaller than the number of extragalactic radio sources with measured rms . for these reasons in this paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the rms of the extragalactic radio sources .",
    "our general strategy is the following .",
    "we consider several types of analytical gmf models , each containing a finite number of parameters . for each model",
    "we calculate the expected rms , and fit them to the observations by the binned @xmath12 method .",
    "the quality of the fit is then used to determine the best values of the gmf parameters and their allowed ranges .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : data ] describes the data .",
    "sections [ sec : models ] and [ sec : method ] describe the implemented models and our method .",
    "the results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains the results and conclusions .",
    "in the present work we use two sets of the rm data . the first one is the compilation of rms recently obtained by @xcite who reanalyzed nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) data .",
    "nvss is the largest by number survey of polarized radio sources at declinations @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it was made in two nearby bands , 1364.9 and 1435.1 mhz ; each having a width of 42 mhz .",
    "simultaneous observations in these two different bands give estimates of the rms of the sources .",
    "the total number of the observed sources was 37,543 with the mean error , estimated by the authors , of @xmath14 .",
    "the sky map of the nvss set is shown in figure  [ figure_nvss ] , which displays the location and rm sign of each source . the data have a large blind spot corresponding to declinations below @xmath15 .",
    "( adopted from @xcite).,width=80 ]     ( adopted from @xcite).,width=80 ]    an advantage of the nvss rm catalog is the large number of sources .",
    "however , observations being made in two close bands lead to relatively large individual rm errors .",
    "also because in general rm is not always constant in @xmath16 , it can have modest variations over a wider range of @xmath3 .",
    "thus an nvss rm , measured in just one small wavelength range at 21 cm ( @xmath17 20.9 - 22.0 cm ) , can differ from an rm measured over a wider wavelength range which tends to average out fluctuations in rm(@xmath16 ) .",
    "such systematic differences will add to the mean error of @xmath18 quoted above by up to @xmath19 rad  m@xmath20 , and will contribute to the widths of the rm comparison plots with the results from the @xcite compilation ( knm11 ) shown in figure  [ figure_nvss - vs - kr ] below . on the other hand , because @xmath21 is small , ambiguities of @xmath22 in the nvss rm s are unlikely to occur , especially at @xmath23 .",
    "it can be easily seen that the nvss data set should be treated with care when considering the sources with large observed rms , which mainly reside near the galactic plane and in the region of inner galaxy . in order to avoid this problem",
    ", we use the nvss data only at galactic latitudes @xmath24 .",
    "the second all - sky data set we used is the compilation by @xcite ( 2257 sources ) .",
    "it consists of @xmath25 revised and statistically more accurate extragalactic radio source rms of p.",
    "p. kronberg et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "these are derived from polarization measurements made over a large `` baseline''of @xmath16 .",
    "the remaining rm s are taken from the canadian galactic plane survey @xcite , the southern galactic plane survey @xcite , and two smaller published lists from @xcite ( 108 rms ) and @xcite ( 68 rms ) .",
    "the extragalactic radio sources in the knm11 set were carefully observed at multiple frequencies and give rms largely free from ambiguities .",
    "errors of the rm measurements in the knm11 set are typically of order @xmath26 .",
    "we use this set for control .",
    "the sky map of the knm11 rms is shown in figure  [ figure_kronberg ] , upper panel .",
    "the lower panel shows the same data smoothed over the circle of @xmath27 centered at the location of each source as described by @xcite .",
    "one may observe a generally good agreement in the rm sky distributions of the nvss and knm11 .",
    "this is particularly visible when comparing figure  [ figure_nvss ] with the lower panel of figure  [ figure_kronberg ] .",
    "the rm sky structure is rather peculiar .",
    "the regions of positive and negative rms are roughly symmetric with respect to the galactic plane in the outer galaxy @xmath28 and anti - symmetric in the inner galaxy . note , however , that the boundary between positive and negative rms in the inner galaxy is displaced away from the galactic plane ( toward negative @xmath29 for @xmath30),that is , rms do not change sign across the galactic plane itself . this fact was observed , e.g. , in @xcite . this overall structure of rms suggests , qualitatively , a galactic field structure that consists of two components , with the disk field being symmetric in @xmath29 with respect to the galactic plane and the halo field anti - symmetric .",
    "although the second data set is significantly smaller , it has much smaller individual rm errors and can be used in two ways .",
    "first , it allows for an independent evaluation of the quality of the nvss data . in order to assess the accuracy of the nvss rms we identified , by positional cross - correlation , the sources that are common to both catalogs .",
    "we did it separately for the two regions @xmath24 and @xmath31 .",
    "we found 1338 pairs and 306 pairs of sources , respectively , separated by less than @xmath32 .",
    "for these sources , we built distributions of differences between rms given in the nvss catalog and in the set by knm11 .",
    "the difference distributions are shown in figure  [ figure_nvss - vs - kr ] .",
    ", shows a gaussian fit for the range ( 200 , 200 ) rad m@xmath20 .",

    "@xmath24 the tails contain @xmath37% of points and are confined within @xmath38 .",
    "the effective error introduced by these tails is of the order of the gaussian part .",
    "thus , in this region the nvss data can be used for our purposes .    on the contrary , in the region",
    "@xmath31 the tails ( containing similar fraction of points ) are spread over a very wide range @xmath39 .",
    "such tails would introduce errors in the low-@xmath29 bins which are too large to constrain the fit .",
    "for this reason we exclude the bins with @xmath31 from the nvss fit , as will be described in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "the knm11 rm set provides statistically more accurate rms in the galactic plane , including areas where the nvss data do not give sky coverage .",
    "this allows us to check whether the models which fit the nvss data also fit the rm data in the galactic plane .",
    "we adopt a general model of the gmf consisting of two different components : a disk field and a halo field @xcite .",
    "each of these two components is parameterized independently . according to the qualitative features of the rm distribution discussed above , for the most part of this work we take the disk field to be symmetric with respect to the galactic plane and the halo field anti - symmetric",
    "( other possibilities will be discussed in section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the general layout of the model is shown in figure  [ sketch_model ] .",
    ".,width=302 ]    [ sketch_model ]     +   +      we consider several disk gmf models .",
    "the first one is the widely used logarithmic spiral model , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "there are two versions of this model depending on whether the direction of the field in two different arms is the same ( axisymmetric , or ass model ) or opposite ( bisymmetric , or bss model ) .",
    "they are defined as follows : @xmath40 @xmath41 or @xmath42    for ass and bss models , respectively . here",
    "@xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the pitch angle and @xmath46 is the distance to the first field reversal .",
    "negative @xmath46 means that the nearest reversal occurs in the direction to the galactic center , positive corresponds to the opposite direction .",
    "@xmath47 is the distance to the galactic center ( we adopt @xmath48  kpc in this paper ) .",
    "the amplitude of the gmf is a function of the radial coordinate @xmath49 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the radius of the central region where the disk field is assumed to have constant magnitude . in the course of the simulations",
    ", the parameters were varied within the following ranges :    l|l|l parameter & min & max + @xmath51 & @xmath52  kpc & @xmath53  kpc + @xmath54 & @xmath55  kpc & @xmath56  kpc + @xmath46 & @xmath57  kpc & @xmath58  kpc + @xmath45 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 +    the second model of the disk field was the axisymmetric field with reversals in concentric rings .",
    "it was taken from @xcite : @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 is radial scale of the mf .",

    "the magnitude of the disk mf at the vicinity of the solar system @xmath72 was taken to be @xmath73 g .",
    "note that , in the total gmf , the disk and halo components will be combined with arbitrary coefficients ( to be determined by fitting ) , so the choice @xmath74 g at this point is merely a matter of definition .",
    "the basic halo model was taken from @xcite : @xmath75 @xmath76^{-1}\\frac{r}{r_0^h } \\exp{\\left ( 1-   { r\\over r_0^h } \\right ) } , \\label{halo1}\\ ] ] where the direction of the field is reversed in the southern hemisphere @xcite .",

    "calculation of the rms , equation  ( [ rm2 ] ) , requires a knowledge of the galactic electron density @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we adopted the ne2001 model developed by @xcite .",
    "however , there is mounting evidence that the original vertical scale of this model is insufficient and pulsar observations are better described by the electron density with larger vertical scale @xcite .",
    "we tried both the original ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 at @xmath109 ) and modified versions ( @xmath110 , @xmath111 at @xmath109 ) of ne2001 .",
    "the preliminary simulations with both versions of ne2001 were made with a coarse grid of gmf parameters .",
    "the original model performed systematically worse than the modified one , so we proceeded to the full simulation with the modified version of ne2001 .",
    "the results presented below were obtained with this modified version .",
    "apart from the test of two vertical scales as described in section  [ sec : results ] , we did not vary any other parameters of ne2001 during the fits .",
    "rms of individual sources are affected by uncertainties due to the intrinsic source contributions to the rm and by small - scale fluctuations of the gmf .",
    "the effect of the coherent component of the gmf can be revealed by averaging over a large number of nearby sources .",
    "the angular bin size should be small enough so that variations of the coherent component of gmf within the bin can be neglected , and it should include a sufficient number of sources to suppress source - to - source fluctuations . applying these requirements , we chose the following binning : the celestial sphere is divided into 18 bands of 10@xmath112 width , from 90@xmath112 to + 90@xmath112 in galactic latitude @xmath29 .",
    "each band is further divided into bins so that individual bins would have roughly equal area , about 100 deg@xmath113 , as shown in figure  [ figure_bin ] .     for details ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    so , there are 36 bins in the 9th band ( @xmath114 ) , but only four in the first one ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "the total number of bins is equal to 422 . after averaging ,",
    "all the nvss data are reduced to 422 values of average rm in each bin .",
    "no outliers were removed at this stage .",
    "figures  [ figure_bands_north ] , and [ figure_bands_south ] shows the averaged rms in the eight bands with @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "the coherent structure is clearly visible .    .",
    "the error bars show the errors used in the fit .",
    ", width=283 ]    .",
    "the error bars show the errors used in the fit.,width=283 ]    the gmf models were treated in a similar way . for each model we simulated 20,000 values of rms at randomly chosen locations and then applied the same binning and averaging procedure to these sets .",
    "the resulting averaged rms were compared to observations .",
    "a somewhat different procedure was used for the set of sources from knm11 . to check the disk field",
    ", we used the sources residing within @xmath118 from the galactic plane .",
    "as their number is more limited ( about 240 ) and they are located irregularly within their respective bins ( 10 deg@xmath113 in this case ) , we simulated model rm values in their exact locations to avoid an additional error that would be produced by different distributions of simulated and real sources within the bin .",
    "important for this analysis is the weighting of different bins or , equivalently , the bin - by - bin estimation of errors .",
    "there are several sources of scatter of individual rms within the bin : internal rm of the source , an anomalous extragalactic rm component , random component of the galactic field , variation of the regular gmf over the bin , fluctuations of the galactic electron density @xmath7 , and the measurement error .",
    "all these factors contribute to deviations of the observed average value of rm from that predicted by the gmf model , and determine the error that has to be assigned to the bin .    if all the above factors were random , it would be possible to estimate the error by statistical means .",
    "note , however , that some of these factors ( e.g. , random component of gmf with coherence length comparable to the bin size , fluctuations of @xmath7 ) may act coherently over the bin .",
    "these factors are much more difficult to treat rigorously .",
    "we therefore take a phenomenological approach and assume that these factors produce an error in the bin that is some fraction of the root mean square ( rms ) of the rms in that bin . in appendix  [ excludedbins ]",
    "we develop a toy model where such proportionality takes place .",
    "taking account of this complication , we have estimated the errors of rms in the individual bins as follows . by considering the sources in the directions of north and south galactic poles where the effect of the regular mf is expected to be suppressed ,",
    "the dispersion in the observed rms of quasars is estimated as @xmath119  rad@xmath120m@xmath20 ( see appendix  [ excludedbins ] ) .",
    "if the rms @xmath121 of rms in the @xmath122th bin did not exceed this value , we set the error of average rms to @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the number of sources in the bin .",
    "the reason is that in this case there is no indication of coherence effects , so one may assume that the error is due to stochastic factors such as the internal scatter , measurement error , and short - scale random mfs .    in the opposite case",
    "we assume that the variance in the observed rms is ( partly ) due to the presence of some unknown features that could act coherently over the bin , but can not be accurately modeled .",
    "we assigned the error of @xmath125 to these bins , where the factor @xmath126 is taken from the toy model of appendix  [ excludedbins ] .",
    "we have checked that the best - fit parameters do not change significantly when this factor is varied in the range @xmath127 .",
    "this uncertainty in the absolute normalization of errors we can not reduce further .",
    "after a bin - by - bin examination , we have increased the errors in bins where there are clearly visible anomalies in the observed data ( see the list of these bins below in the appendix [ excludedbins ] ) .",
    "these problems are : ( 1 ) existence of small cluster of sources with rms sharply different from the surrounding values ( 2 ) a strongly irregular distribution of the observed sources across the bin ( due to , e.g. , deep surveys within small regions ) that could bias the average compared to the case of a random distribution of the simulated sources , and ( 3 ) the presence of sources with absolute values of rms larger than 300 rad m@xmath20 which should be treated with suspicion due to the @xmath128 ambiguity in the definition of polarization angle .",
    "the total number of bins with errors increased by hand is about 10% .",
    "the algorithm is described in appendix [ excludedbins ] .",
    "some bins were completely removed from the analysis .",
    "first , these are the bins in polar regions with @xmath129 ( 50 bins ) and @xmath130 ( 77 bins ) . in these regions",
    "the model values of rm are small because the projection of the mf onto the line of sight is suppressed ( recall that in our model both disk and halo fields are parallel to the galactic plane regardless of the parameters ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there is strong evidence that some sort of screen is present in the direction of high latitudes @xcite which may provide a dominant contribution in these regions .",
    "the averaged rms in polar regions , together with the assigned errors , are shown in figures  [ northern_cap ] , and [ southern_cap ] where some bias toward positive values of rms can indeed be seen .",
    "second , all bins with @xmath131 were excluded because we could not trust the accuracy of the nvss values in this region as explained in section  [ sec : data ] . finally , we excluded all bins where the number of observed sources was smaller than 30 ( this primarily concerns bins overlapping with the blind spot ) .",
    "figure  [ figure_bin ] shows the excluded bins in gray .",
    "a similar prescription was adopted for the analysis of the 1@xmath112 strip along the galactic plane using the rm set by knm11 , with the following changes .",
    "as the area in this case is 10 times smaller ( @xmath132  deg@xmath113 instead of @xmath133  deg@xmath113 ) we set our lower limit to three sources in the bin . also , we increased the assigned error value to @xmath134 instead of @xmath125 , thus attempting to reproduce the enhanced uncertainty in the disk due to the presence of a large number of local structures and very long propagation path length inside the disk ( of order of tens of kpc ) . in the 1@xmath112 strip ,",
    "after visual examination , we removed 20 sources out of total number of 259 .",
    "rm values of the removed sources clearly demonstrate large differences with rms of neighboring sources .",
    "the best values of the gmf parameters were identified by the maximum likelihood method .",
    "this amounts to minimizing the value of the @xmath12 defined as follows , @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the total number of bins that we have included in the fit , @xmath137 is the difference between the observed and simulated average rm values for the @xmath138th bin and @xmath139 is the adopted error of the observed average .",
    "since the rms ( equation  ( [ rm2 ] ) ) are linear in the mf , the total rm of a given source is a simple sum of the disk and halo contributions . making use of this property",
    ", we separately simulated more than 30,000 halo rm maps and 10,000 disk rm maps , corresponding to different parameters varied within the ranges described in section  [ sec : models ] . at this stage the strengths of the disk and halo components were held fixed and set to values given in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "then each disk configuration was combined with each halo configuration with two arbitrary coefficients @xmath140 and @xmath141 . for a global gmf model thus obtained , the value of @xmath12 in equation  ( [ chi2 ] ) is a quadratic polynomial in @xmath140 and @xmath141 , whose minimum with respect to @xmath140 and @xmath141 we found analytically .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath140 and @xmath141 determined the strength of the disk and halo fields .",
    "the parameters of the gmf field were varied , within the ranges given in section  [ sec : models ] , by two different methods : by uniformly covering a given parameter range with a regular grid ( grid - type simulation ) and by randomly picking parameter values from a uniform distribution over the desired range ( monte carlo type simulations ) .",
    "the disk field was simulated using the grid method , whereas for the halo we used both methods in roughly equal proportion .",
    "because of the uncertainty in the absolute normalization of @xmath12 resulting from uncertainties in the error estimation ( see section  [ sec : errors ] ) , we did not combine the northern and southern galactic hemispheres in a single fit .",
    "the two hemispheres do not come on equal footing because of the blind spot in the southern sky . instead",
    ", our general fitting strategy was as follows .",
    "first we performed the fit using the nvss data for the northern hemisphere only , thus obtaining the preliminary set of models .",
    "next , we fitted the nvss data in the southern hemisphere .",
    "we chose only the models that performed well in both tests and had the same value of the disk field .",
    "note that this allowed for different halo fields in the northern and southern hemispheres . in these tests",
    "we imposed the additional constraint that @xmath142 be greater than 1.8 @xmath2 g in both hemispheres , to conform with the results of other observations .",
    "models were selected as acceptable if they satisfied the following requirement , @xmath143 where @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) is a minimal value of @xmath12 ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "these are the models having parameters within @xmath147 from the best - fit ones .",
    "note that the criterion ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) is insensitive to the absolute normalization of the errors .",
    "we choose such a criterion to reduce the effect of the ambiguities in the error estimation discussed in section  [ sec : errors ] .",
    "independently , we fitted the sources from the compilation by knm11 in the narrow strip of the galactic plane @xmath148 .",
    "this imposed additional constraints on the structure of the field in the thin disk to which our fit of nvss data is insensitive . requiring that fits to both the nvss and knm11 data",
    "be good , we performed the final selection of the models .",
    "overall , we required that a successful model passes three separate fits : to the nvss data in the northern and southern hemispheres , and to the knm11 data in the disk .",

    "the fit was most sensitive to the pitch angle @xmath45 .",
    "the vertical scale of the disk mf @xmath54 and the distance to the nearest reversal @xmath46 affect the fit less .",
    "there was no significant influence of the @xmath51 parameter , so we excluded it from further studies fixing its value at @xmath150kpc .",
    "the same concerns the parameters @xmath101 and @xmath104 which were fixed at @xmath151  kpc and @xmath152  kpc .",
    "we could not make a successful fit using the disk component only .",
    "the addition of the halo component decreases @xmath144 by a factor of 1.5 . due to a weaker effect of the halo mf ,",
    "its parameters are estimated with larger uncertainties than the disk ones .",
    "in addition , there is a degeneracy between the height of the halo @xmath99 , the amplitude of the halo field and , to some extent , the radial size @xmath94 .",
    "even unrealistically large values of the halo field of order tens of @xmath2 g could give an acceptable fit if the halo is placed at a large distance from the galactic plane where the concentration of the electrons greatly decreases ( cf .",
    "figure [ degeneracy ] ) .",
    "there is also a degeneracy between the vertical scales of the gmf model ( both halo and disk ) and the vertical scale of the electron density ( recall that the latter was held fixed during the fits ) .",
    "the strength of the disk field corresponding to the allowed set of models resides in the @xmath153 g range , largely concentrating around @xmath154 g .",
    "the amplitude of the allowed halo field is in the range @xmath155 g .",
    "note that the halo field strength is constrained by the synchrotron radio - emission from the population of galactic relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "these constraints favor halo fields with the magnitude in the range @xmath156 g .",
    "ring models of the disk field performed rather poorly in the northern hemisphere no matter what was the halo field , giving the best value of @xmath157 for 101 dof , which corresponds to @xmath158 as compared to @xmath159 for the best - fit model with the spiral disk .",
    "thus , these models are disfavored by the nvss data , confirming the earlier finding of simard - normandin & kronberg(1980 ) .",
    "finally , our attempts to improve the quality of the fit by introducing a non - zero halo pitch angle were unsuccessful : there was no significant change of @xmath12 when non - zero pitch angle of the halo field was varied within the range @xmath160 $ ] .",
    "we also could not improve the fit by choosing the alternative model of the halo described by equations  ( [ halo2 ] ) and ( [ halo3 ] ) .    _ south_. the data from the southern hemisphere are more sparse because of the blind spot , and show more scatter , so the fits are generally worse .",
    "the best - fit ass - type model gives @xmath161 for @xmath162 dof , which corresponds to @xmath163 .",

    "the best - fit ass - type model gives @xmath167 for @xmath168 dof ( @xmath169 ) , while the best - fit bss model gives @xmath170 for @xmath168 dof ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "the comparison between these data and the best - fit model is shown in figure  [ plane_fit ] .    .",
    "areas not included into the fit are shaded with light - blue.,width=302 ]    the results are fully compatible with the other fits .",
    "they also agree with the results of @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is not enough information about the region around the direction to the galactic center where the discrepancy between predictions of different models is the largest .",
    "this reduces the discriminative power of the fit .",
    "nevertheless , the fit was very sensitive to the field strength in the disk , so its results impose most stringent constraints on this parameter .",
    "also , it was shown by @xcite that the knm11 data favor the pitch angle near the disk of @xmath172 .",
    "taking this constraint into account allows us to exclude positive pitch angles , which is not possible from the fits to the nvss data alone .    in both north and south",
    "fits of the nvss data , the reduced @xmath12 values significantly exceed unity ( especially in the southern hemisphere ) .",
    "this could result either from our underestimation of errors , or from features in the data that can not be accounted for by our models .",
    "visual examination of the fits ( figures  [ north_fit ] and [ south_fit ] ) shows that there exists a systematic discrepancy between the data and the best - fit models in the region @xmath173 which corresponds to directions away from the galactic center .",
    "the discrepancy is present in both northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "in fact , the observed variation of rm in the outer galaxy is too strong to be accounted for in _ any _ model that has a thick disk , or halo with a nearly tangential field in the outer galaxy ( i.e. , small pitch angle ) if the field magnitude decays away from the galactic center .",
    "so , either these models are completely wrong in this region , or the large rms are caused by some nearby anomaly in the mf or the electron density , which is sufficiently close to subtend a large angle of about @xmath174 .",
    "the latter option is supported by the fact that the variation of rm which is responsible for this feature does not visibly decrease away from the galactic plane , as it would if it were due to an additional galactic arm or another global ( and more distant ) feature .",
    "interestingly , the anomaly in the nearby region ( the so - called region a ) was pointed out previously @xcite .    for an additional check of this assumption we made a separate fit of rms of the sources located in the direction of the inner galaxy ,",
    "i.e. , at @xmath175 . excluding this apparent anomaly should improve the fit and show the extent to which the best - fit parameters were affected by its presence .",
    "the results of this additional test are as follows .",
    "_ north - inner_. the best fit gives @xmath176 for 46 dof , considerably better than for the full sky .",
    "the allowed values of parameters obtained from the restricted fit largely coincide with those obtained from the full fit .",
    "this indicates that the full fit is not dominated by the anomalous region .    _ south - inner_. @xmath177 for 22 dof .",
    "the quality of the fit has considerably increased as compared to the fit in the full range of longitudes , but is still worse than in the northern hemisphere .",
    "all our attempts to fit the outer galaxy separately ( @xmath178 ) , even those including an extra disk component , were unsuccessful in the sense that we could not get @xmath146 smaller than five .",
    "this confirms our conclusion that it is not possible to fit the anomalous region with the gmf models of the type considered here .",
    "the results of individual fits are presented in table  [ param_ranges ] in the form of acceptable ranges of model parameters .",
    "it should be stressed that there are dependencies and degeneracies among them ; table  [ param_ranges ] only shows the maximum variation of each parameter within the whole acceptable set of models . in other words ,",
    "not every combination of the acceptable parameters gives an acceptable model .",
    "parameters of the models which fit the data best and are in agreement with all fits are summarized in tables [ disktable ] , and [ halotable ] .",

    "first , as has been already mentioned in section  [ sec : electron - density ] , we have run preliminary simulations with the original , lower vertical scale of electron density . for the realistic strength of the disk field @xmath187 and the original electron density , we found only @xmath12 values larger than @xmath188 as compared to @xmath189 for the best - fit case .",
    "if we vary the magnitude of the disk field , the value of @xmath12 becomes close to the best - fit value for field strengths @xmath190 , which is clearly unacceptable . in conclusion ,",
    "our simulations disfavor the original vertical scale of the electron density .",
    "second , we have tested different combinations of symmetries ( with respect to the galactic plane ) of the halo and disk fields in order to check whether the nvss data alone favor the symmetric disk and antisymmetric halo as we have chosen in our model . with our fitting procedure which treats the northern and southern hemispheres independently ,",
    "no additional simulations are required for this test .",
    "for instance , for an anti - symmetric disk field we simply have to require that the coefficients with which the disk contribution enters the northern and southern hemispheres are opposite in sign .",
    "we could not find a satisfactory fit neither with ass nor with bss anti - symmetric disk field , obtaining the values of @xmath12 more than four times larger than the best - fit value . in the case of the symmetric disk and symmetric halo",
    ", the best fit gives @xmath12 2.5 times larger than the best - fit model .",
    "thus , the combination of the symmetric ( with respect to @xmath29 ) disk and antisymmetric ( with respect to @xmath29 ) halo is favored by the nvss data .",
    "the latest faraday rotation data show an unmistakable coherent component of the rms over the sky .",
    "the rms are correlated in sign and value over the largest angular scales . moreover ,",
    "the distribution of rms is correlated with the galactic plane and the direction to the galactic center .",
    "this strongly indicates the galactic origin of this coherence and provides firm evidence for the existence of a regular gmf .",
    "apart from the galactic plane region @xmath191 , the global pattern of the rms has different symmetry with respect to the galactic plane in the inner and outer galaxy : symmetric outside and anti - symmetric inside ( see figure   [ fig : bin_nvss ] ) .",
    "this change of the symmetry can not be achieved with a single ( symmetric or antisymmetric ) component of the gmf .",
    "at least two components  disk and halo  are required ( figure  [ sketch_model ] ) .",
    "since the study of the mf in the disk shows that it does not change sign across the galactic plane itself , the combination of the symmetric disk field and the anti - symmetric halo field is favored .",
    "we have demonstrated that such a combination , with properly chosen amplitudes of components , reproduces the observed pattern of rms very well .",
    "several further conclusions can be made .    *",
    "the cross check between the nvss and the smaller knm11 set shows that the quality of the nvss is sufficient for our purposes all over the sky except , in the @xmath192 band around the galactic plane .",
    "* there is a feature in the observed rms near the direction to the galactic anti - center that can not be accounted for by models of the type considered in this paper ( nearly tangential field decaying away from the galactic center ) .",
    "this feature may be due to some unspecified local structure . *",
    "a ring model of the gmf is disfavored as compared to the model with logarithmic spiral arms . in the former case",
    "the best value of @xmath146 is a factor of @xmath193 larger than in the latter .",
    "* our fits favor the increased vertical scale of the electron density distribution as proposed by @xcite .",
    "we were unable to find any fit with the original vertical scale of ne2001 model and strong disk field .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "* our fits favor somewhat smaller values of the pitch angle @xmath45 than have been discussed in the literature previously .",
    "these smaller values agree with the recent results of @xcite where the reference value of @xmath194 was obtained by a totally different method .",
    "our fitting procedure could not discriminate between the ass and bss models because a major contribution to the extragalactic source rms ( especially at @xmath195 ) comes from the near vicinity of the solar system ; in this region both models behave quite similarly .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the galactic plane region may be more sensitive to the differences between the ass and bss models .",
    "two `` benchmark '' models ( one with the ass and one with the bss disk field ) are presented in table  [ tab : benchmark ] .",
    "these models fit the rm data well and have values of parameters favored by other studies ( not too small pitch angle @xmath45 , not too strong halo field and the magnitude in the vicinity of the earth close to @xmath73 g ) .",
    "they can be used , e.g. , for propagation of cosmic rays through the galaxy . at ultra - high energies ,",

    "more precise understanding of the gmf can be achieved by taking into account of other data , also sensitive to the mf , such as rms of pulsars , measurements of the galactic synchrotron radiation , etc .",

    "in our fitting procedure , each bin included in the analysis was characterized by an average rm and its error @xmath207 .",
    "here we describe the algorithm by which these errors were assigned on a bin - by - bin basis .",
    "first , we estimated the intrinsic dispersion of rms of extragalactic sources . to this end",
    "we investigated the regions on the sky where the influence of the gmf is expected to be suppressed .",
    "since rms are proportional to the mf component that is parallel to the line of sight , these are the regions around the galactic poles . considering the sources with @xmath208 we found that the dispersion of rms of individual sources in these regions was about @xmath209 . comparing to figure  [ figure_nvss - vs - kr ]",
    "we see that the dominant contribution to this number comes from the measurement errors . in the error assignment algorithm",
    ", we adopted the value of @xmath210 as an indicator of whether a given bin is perturbed by effects other than the random scatter of sources .    if a bin showed the dispersion of rms @xmath121 smaller than @xmath210 we considered it unperturbed and assigned its error on a statistical basis .",
    "since the average of a sample of @xmath211 elements varies around the true average with the width @xmath212 , where @xmath213 is the variance of the distribution , we assigned to such bins an error of @xmath214 , @xmath124 being the number of sources in the bin . in practice",
    ", this situation occurs only for high - latitude bins .    in the opposite case , i.e. , when the dispersion @xmath121 was larger than @xmath210 , we considered the bin as perturbed by coherence effects .",
    "these may be due to , e.g. , random mf with the coherence length comparable to the bin size , fluctuations of electron density , strong variation of the regular component across the bin , etc . in this case",
    "the statistical approach is not correct , and a precise determination of the error is difficult .",
    "we have assumed that the error in such bins is some fraction of the bin variance @xmath121 , which we have adopted to be @xmath126 , so that the error in perturbed bins was taken @xmath215 .",
    "we can not rigorously derive this coefficient ( although it can be motivated by a toy model presented below ) .",
    "since this uncertainty propagates directly into the value of @xmath12 , it results in some uncertainty of the absolute normalization of the latter . note , however , that the ratios of @xmath12 are less affected by this uncertainty .",
    "the following toy model shows how the proportionality between the error and the dispersion in the bin may come about .",
    "let the random part of the mf consist of cells of a typical size @xmath216  pc , such that their contributions to rm have zero mean and the dispersion @xmath217 .",
    "if the cells were statistically independent , individual sources would have an rm dispersion given by @xmath218 , where @xmath136 is the total number of cells along the line of sight ( we have neglected the internal scatter ) .",
    "however , for sources in one bin a number @xmath219 of nearby cells contributes _",
    "coherently_. if @xmath220 this will not change the dispersion @xmath221 over the bin .",
    "the error , on the contrary , will be dominated by the coherent contribution , @xmath222 .",
    "thus , the error and the dispersion are proportional to one another with the coefficient @xmath223 .",
    "the latter coefficient is purely geometrical . taking @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is the bin size , and @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is the length of the trajectory inside gmf , we find @xmath228 .",
    "interestingly , similar conclusions ( proportionality and a similar coefficient ) are obtained by considering a perturbation caused by a close group of a few sources having similar rms substantially different from the rest of the sources in the bin .    as a last step ,",
    "all bins were subject to visual scrutiny , with the result that some of the bins were completely removed from the analysis .",
    "these are the bins showing obvious pathologies like small number of sources or non - uniform distribution across the bin ( e.g. , some bins at the boundary of the nvss blind spot ) , compact aggregates of sources with rms drastically different from the surrounding value , etc .",
    "finally , some bins with such pathologies were assigned large errors ( 23 times larger than prescribed by the above algorithm ) by hand .",
    "this was done in cases where the corresponding bin might serve as a good discriminator between models , even with a large error .",
    "a constant error of @xmath229 was used in this case .",
    "this value was chosen in such a way that these bins do not contribute significantly into the value of @xmath12 , at least near the best - fit point .",
    "we have checked that the results of the fits do not depend on the precise choice of these errors .",
