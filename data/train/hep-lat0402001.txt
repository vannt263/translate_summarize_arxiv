    "lscher proposed the multiboson algorithm@xcite in which a polynomial approximation to the inverse of the fermion matrix is used .",
    "this algorithm is considered to be an alternative one to simulate dynamical qcd .",
    "borii and de forcrand@xcite noticed that the polynomial approximation can be used to simulate odd flavour qcd .",
    "then the multiboson algorithm is used to study the deconfinement transition in one flavour qcd@xcite .",
    "the original hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm@xcite is limited for even flavour case . however the polynomial approximation can be also applied for the hmc@xcite , which means that one can also simulate odd flavour qcd by the hmc@xcite .",
    "we investigate the phase structure of one flavour qcd by the hmc and check whether different algorithms give the same results .",
    "we calculate polyakov loop , its susceptibility and binder cumulant and use the @xmath1 method@xcite to locate the precise position of the phase transition .",
    "mainly we present results from the wilson gauge action , and also give preliminary results from the dbw2 gauge action@xcite .",
    "the partition function of @xmath0 qcd is given by @xmath2 \\det d \\exp(-s_{g}[u ] ) .",
    "$ ] one can approximate the inverse of @xmath3 by a polynomial@xcite as @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the roots of the polynomial @xmath6 . for the even degree @xmath7 , det@xmath3 can be rewritten as d= c_n ( t^_n(d)t_n(d))^-1 , where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a correction factor to the polynomial approximation .",
    "det@xmath10 can be expressed as , & & ( t_n^(d)t_n(d))^-1 + & & ( -^t_n^(d)t_n(d ) )",
    ". then one can define @xmath0 hamiltonian for hmc algorithm as , h^n_f=1=_ip_i^2+s_g[u]+^t_n^(d)t_n(d ) . where @xmath11 are momenta which are conjugate to link variables .",
    "@xmath12 is manifestly positive , which is essential to the implementation of the hmc .",
    "the correction factor @xmath13 is used to make the algorithm exact@xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we estimated the critical @xmath14 using the @xmath1-method .",
    "the data were fitted to eq.([eqn : lfit]) eq.([eqn : grfit ] ) . for eq.([eqn : grfit ] ) @xmath15 was fixed to @xmath16 in accordance with @xcite . as an example in fig.[chi2 ] @xmath17 curve at @xmath18 is shown . here",

    "we determine @xmath20 at the minimum point of the @xmath17 curve .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 should coincide with each other .",
    "however we observed that at @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath23 is slightly different from others .",
    "this might be due to less statistics . to determine @xmath20 precisely more statistics is needed .",
