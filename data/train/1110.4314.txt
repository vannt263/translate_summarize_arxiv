    "another possible culprit might be the chromospheric activity , since this phenomenon causes an emission in the core of the @xmath10 @xmath12 line ( @xcite ) .",

    "they might be either field bulge stars or objects affected by differential reddening .",
    "@xcite found a double peaked distribution when applying their @xmath101 metallicity relation to stars in ngc  1851 .",
    "this is a peculiar ggc , with a split along the sub - giant and the rg branches , that might be due to the presence of two stellar populations with different @xmath22 abundance ( ca07 ; @xcite ) .",

    "the above results indicate that possible differences in cluster rg colors including the @xmath6-band should be cautiously treated , since they might be caused either by changes in @xmath6 and/or by other heavy elements or by molecular bands .",
    "we show that the @xmath0 index is a good diagnostic to estimate the global metal abundance of field and cluster rgs , and it can be also adopted to detect stars affected by @xmath6 enhancement . moreover , the @xmath0 index is more sensitive than the @xmath21 index in the metal - poor regime , and is less affected by @xmath118 peculiarities .",
    "the current mic relations have been validated by adopting rgs in ngc  6522 and field rgs with known spectroscopic abundances , and provide metallicities with an accuracy better than 0.2 dex .",
