    "urban traffic congestion is a major problem facing the modern world , causing losses of billions of hours every year , with a negative impact on productivity and consequently on the world s economy @xcite . according to the urban mobility report @xcite , in 2011 the cost of traffic congestion ( in terms of wasted time and fuel ) was @xmath0 billion dollars , considering @xmath1 urban areas of the united states .",
    "besides , traffic congestion contributes to the climate change .",
    "the us department of transportation reported that the transportation sector accounted for about @xmath2% of total us greenhouse gas ( ghg ) emissions , in @xmath3 , making it the second largest source of ghg emissions . in @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath5 billion pounds of additional carbon dioxide ( co@xmath6 ) gas were released into the atmosphere because of traffic congestion , according to report @xcite .",
    "vehicles traveling at @xmath7 km / h emit @xmath8% less carbon emissions than vehicles traveling at @xmath9 km / h @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "both academic researchers and industry leaders agree on the importance of its ( intelligent transportation systems ) to reduce traffic congestion , with the long - term goal of mitigating environmental changes .",
    "its covers several mobility aspects , including urban traffic management ( utm ) , safe driving , and easy parking , with particular attention to greening challenges .",
    "its merges and benefits from several scientific and technical fields , such as traffic theory , image processing , sensing and communication systems design .",
    "utm , in particular , is no more uniquely a civil engineering problem , because of the progress in communication technologies such as cellular , satellite positioning , vehicle - to - infrastructure ( v2i ) and vehicle - to - vehicle ( v2v ) systems .",
    "utm is usually achieved by means of a two - step process .",
    "firstly , road traffic information is collected / estimated .",
    "traditionally , such a collection of information is performed by means of sensors and cameras , installed along the roads .",
    "secondly , collected information is processed ( _ e.g. _ , to obtain a view on the traffic volume , as well as routing advices , and then broadcasted by means of radio stations , electronic road panels , or public transportation web sites .",
    "the dissemination of traffic information to the drivers is expected to reduce the congestion in urban networks .",
    "thus , utm activities fall into two main categories : _ urban traffic estimation ( ute ) _ and _ urban traffic optimization ( uto ) _ , which have different technical approaches , represented in the bottom layer of the diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : taxo2 ] .",
    "traffic estimation is mainly based on the following methodologies :    1 .",
    "analytical modeling , with queueing theory @xcite and other techniques ; 2 .   monitoring with fixed sensors , installed under or along the roads , such as loop detectors , infrared sensors , radars or surveillance cameras , also known as closed - caption television ( cctv ) @xcite ; 3 .   monitoring with mobile phones , _",
    "i.e. _ , based on anonymous analysis of signaling messages and on localization of events that occur into the cellular network , such as call in progress , sms sending , or handover @xcite ; 4 .",
    "monitoring with mobile devices combined with gps receivers , either embedded into vehicles or into the mobile devices themselves ( _ e.g. _ , smartphones )  a technique referred to as fcd ( floating car data ) @xcite .",
    "different approaches can be merged , in order to enhance the estimation of road traffic and to increase the accuracy of information retrieval  we refer to these approaches as `` hybrid '' methods .    in recent years , traffic optimization has been addressed according to two main directions :    1 .",
    "traffic signal control , based on different techniques , _",
    "e.g. _ , markov modeling @xcite and game theory @xcite ; 2 .   vehicle routing control , based on graph theory @xcite @xcite , or assignment and insertion algorithms @xcite .    in this article",
    "we review utm techniques , with particular focus on the period @xmath10 .",
    "other survey papers appeared in the recent years , tackling similar topics .",
    "for example , valerio _ et al . _",
    "@xcite addressed the usage of cellular networks in urban traffic estimation , while kastrinaki _",
    "@xcite focused on the usage of video processing method .",
    "the novelty of our survey is the linking of vehicular ad - hoc networks ( vanets ) with utm ( in particular , uto ) , compared and contrasted with `` traditional '' techniques .",
    "vanets have gained the interest of both industrial and academic researchers during the last decade .",
    "for example , a recent book by hartenstein _",
    "_ provides an overview of the applications and technical aspects of vanets @xcite .",
    "our survey is a complementary work to such a book , with a particular focus on utm techniques .    on the other hand ,",
    "considering the recent opportunities provided by the use of the next generation of cellular access technologies in the vehicular context @xcite , our survey provides an updated view on the challenging approaches based on mobile phones , distributed and peer - to - peer overlays , vanets and hybrid methodologies .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our purpose is not to demonstrate that vanet - based approaches are better than traditional ones .",
    "vanets are far from being ready for large - scale deployment .",
    "however , they are certainly interesting , as they are not only able to collect urban traffic information , but also to deal with data filtering and dissemination @xcite .",
    "for example , v2v and v2i communications have been proposed to obtain real - time ute information @xcite . moreover , uto methods can be integrated with the vanet framework , to achieve global convergence more quickly , in a distributed manner .",
    "these approaches are discussed within a specific section of this survey .",
    "it is worth mentioning that _ vehicle routing control _ is completely different from _ routing in vehicular networks_. the former deals with routing of vehicles , while the second deals with data routing protocols in vanets .",
    "our survey does not address routing in vehicular networks .",
    "other survey papers can be consulted by the reader for more details about routing protocols in vanets @xcite @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the survey is organized as follows . in sections  [ ute ] and  [ uto ]",
    ", we tackle the works dealt with urban traffic estimation and optimization , respectively . in section  [ vanet ] ,",
    "we illustrate how vanet technologies have been proposed as means for the improvement of utm . in section  [ model ]",
    ", we discuss future research directions and challenges related to ute and uto .",
    "one of the aims of traffic models is to estimate flows",
    ". these can be link flows , origin - destination flows , path flows , node flows , flows passing through a subset of nodes or links , and other .",
    "in addition , traffic models attempt to analyze how flows change with time and traffic intensity .",
    "traffic flow information , estimated or collected , is used in various its - related applications .",
    "this information can be integrated with traffic congestion warning systems , such as updated arrival timings of public transport , providing real - time information to the public .",
    "we categorize hereafter the different methods existing in the literature for urban traffic collection and/or estimation .",
    "three main variables are used to model traffic streams : speed , defined as the distance covered per unit time ; density , defined as the number of vehicles per unit area of the roadway ; and flow , which is the number of vehicles passing a reference point per unit of time .",
    "such variables are usually represented as a function of time , but probably the most known graph is the one which shows flow as a function of density  which is frequently used to illustrate congestion shockwaves .",
    "one of the advantages of using analytical methods is the possibility to test different scenarios  _ what - if _ situations  without the need of installing devices ( sensors , transceivers , etc . ) in the environment .",
    "however , analytical modeling methods are often difficult to generalize to model large urban networks .",
    "[ fig.analytic ] shows the different analytical modeling methods we consider in this section .",
    "state - of - art traffic models can be classified into three groups , characterized by different granularity : 1 ) _ microscopic _ , 2 ) _ macroscopic _ , or 3 ) _",
    "mesoscopic_. microscopic models consider single cars as entities , which move over lanes , which are parts of roads , which form a network .",
    "car dynamics are analytically modeled , by taking into account also the effect of car density on their acceleration and speed , and the characteristics of the road .",
    "conversely , macroscopic modeling considers traffic as a fluid , characterized in terms of density , flow , mean speed of a traffic stream , and other .",
    "macroscopic models may integrate microscopic traffic flow models , converting the single - entity level characteristics to comparable system level characteristics .",
    "macroscopic models require less computation than microscopic models , and are particularly suitable for real - time applications , such as online traffic state estimation and control .",
    "finally , mesoscopic models fill the gap between the aggregation - based approach of macroscopic models and the individual interactions of the microscopic ones .",
    "mesoscopic models normally describe traffic entities at a high level of detail ( _ e.g. _ , groups of cars ) , but their behavior and interactions are described at a lower level of detail .",
    "for example , vehicles may be grouped into packets , acting as single entities whose speed on each road ( link ) is derived from a speed - density function defined for that link . in another mesoscopic approach , the road is modeled as a queueing part and a running part : the vehicles traverse the running part of the road , and their speed is determined by means of a macroscopic speed - density function . at the downstream end ,",
    "a queue - server is transferring the vehicles to connecting roads .    for microscopic models , several algorithms based on _ graph theory _ have been proposed .",
    "for example , castillo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite illustrated two approaches  algebraic and topological , respectively  to determine which subset of flows can be calculated when another subset of flows has been observed , independently of route choice probabilities .    with respect to mesoscopic models ,",
    "_ queueing theory _ has been frequently used . in such models ,",
    "the basic idea is that the road segment offers a service to the vehicles , in a fifo mode .",
    "the buffer size of the queue equals to the maximum number of vehicles the lane can handle .",
    "the total time spent by a vehicle in the road segment is the sum of the service time and the waiting time .",
    "fig  [ fig : queue ] illustrates the concept , for a signalized road segment .",
    "woensel and vandaele showed that , in most cases , highway traffic flows during non - congested hours are best described using a m / g/1 queueing model @xcite . during congested hours , instead , the state dependent queueing gi / g / m models are more realistic .",
    "the analysis was conducted by means of a dataset collected by the ministry of transportation of the flemish government ( belgium ) . to evaluate the difference between the speeds obtained from the queueing models and",
    "the ones empirically observed , the authors adopted the theil inequality coefficient @xmath11 , instead of the root mean square error , because the former statistical tool does not over - emphasizes large errors .",
    "the m / g/1 queueing model gave @xmath12 , regarding non - congested hours .",
    "the gi / g/3 model gave @xmath13 for morning congestion , and @xmath14 for evening congestion .",
    "all other models gave higher @xmath11 values .",
    "more recently , osorio and bierlaire proposed an approximate queueing network model that resorts to finite capacity queueing theory to account for congested conditions in urban traffic @xcite .",
    "the proposed model considers a set of intersections and analytically captures the interactions between queues .",
    "also _ petri nets _ are widely used to model concurrent vehicle behaviors in urban traffic models . in a recent work @xcite , lopez - neri _ et al .",
    "_ used the multi - level petri net based formalism named @xmath15-lns @xcite , to describe the structure of urban traffic systems and their components behaviors .",
    "the proposed hierarchical modeling framework allows to study the interaction of one road user with other users , static components and traffic information signals , leading to more complex emergent behaviors ( such as queues , traffic jams , gridlock , green waves ) .",
    "the knowledge produced by the @xmath15-lns model can be used to feed micro - simulators .",
    "the authors used an agent - based simulator and studied a network structure consisting of @xmath16 one - lane and one - way segments and @xmath7 traffic lights ; each intersection had @xmath17 traffic lights . during the simulation , @xmath18 vehicles",
    "were generated , and the flow - density relations were analyzed on the different segments .",
    "four strategies for traffic light timings were compared .",
    "unfortunately , simulation results were not validated by means of empirical data comparisons .",
    "tonguz _ et al .",
    "_ introduced a novel _ cellular automata ( ca ) _ approach to construct urban traffic mobility models @xcite .",
    "the authors implemented a model of road intersection with traffic signal coordination , providing rules for realistic motion of turning vehicles .",
    "due to its discrete nature , the ca model allows very fast implementation and can microscopically simulate huge networks in real - time .",
    "the authors used the new york city traffic pattern as input , and presented simulation results for : the average flow rate at an intersection , the average number of congested intersections , and the traffic density .",
    "a bayesian network ( bn ) is a directed acyclic graph in which variables are represented by nodes and arcs between nodes represent conditional dependencies between the variables .",
    "most bn models used in stochastic dynamic models are based on gaussian or mixtures of gaussian distributions . to provide a more realistic and a positive range for the variables , castillo _ et al .",
    "_ have recently proposed a generalized beta - gaussian bayesian network ( gbgn ) @xcite .",
    "the proposed model is applicable to very large networks , and was tested using three networks of increasing complexity , namely the nguyen - dupuis network @xcite , the ciudad real network with @xmath19 links and @xmath20 paths and the vermont state network ( monitored by @xmath21 stations ) .",
    "the gbgn provides very reasonable predictions , and shows a good behavior with respect to missing data , as long as the number of affected links is small .",
    "for example , regarding the flow , the mean root square error between simulated data and real data is below @xmath22 .",
    "proposed a data aggregation approach for traffic flow prediction @xcite .",
    "the source time series is the traffic flow volume that is collected @xmath23 h / day over several years . a weekly similarity time series , a daily similarity time series , and an hourly time series are generated from the source time series , using a moving average ( ma ) model , an exponential smoothing ( exp ) model and an autoregressive ma ( arima ) model , respectively .",
    "the proposed data aggregation strategy uses a _ neural network _ , which allows to obtain a more accurate forecast than any individual model alone .",
    "predicted flow results are compared with real data , showing a mean absolute percentage error ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , for increasing values of the forecast horizon ( from 1 to 3 hours ) .",
    "neural networks have been used , more recently , also by chan _",
    "_ for short - term traffic flow forecasting @xcite .",
    "the proposed approach ( called exp - lm ) uses exponential smoothing to preprocess traffic flow data by removing the lumpiness , before employing a variant of the levenberg - marquardt ( lm ) algorithm to train the weights of a neural network .",
    "results indicate that , in general , test errors obtained by exp - lm to forecast flow are smaller than those obtained by the other tested algorithms . in general , the test error of the exp - lm approach is always below @xmath26 .    _ fuzzy logic _ is also widely used to support the modeling and prediction of urban traffic flow .",
    "for example , dimitriou _ et al .",
    "_ presented an adaptive hybrid fuzzy rule - based system ( frbs ) approach for the modeling and short - term forecasting of traffic flow in urban arterial networks @xcite .",
    "the approach has the advantage of suitably addressing data imprecision and uncertainty .",
    "indeed , the mean squared relative error for the traffic flow modeling was @xmath27 , the best one among those of the approaches considered in this survey .",
    "it also enables the incorporation of experts knowledge on local traffic conditions within the model structure .",
    "_ used a fuzzy input fuzzy output filter ( fifo - filter ) for grouping traffic patterns with similar characteristics .",
    "in addition , the authors used a multi - layer feed - forward neural network ( mlfn ) , optimized by means of evolutionary strategies ( es ) , to predict the traffic in the next time step based only on the present traffic input @xcite .",
    "the mlfn - es model gave the following values of mean absolute percentage error , for the traffic flow :",
    "@xmath28 on saturdays , @xmath29 on sundays , and an average of @xmath30 for the entire test set , including week day and weekend data",
    ".      advanced traffic information systems ( tis ) , but also urban traffic optimization ( uto ) systems ( see section [ uto ] ) , require real - time estimate of the current traffic state as an input .",
    "single - loop detectors are the most common vehicle detector .",
    "many new , out - of - pavement , detectors seek to replace loop detectors by emulating the operation of single - loop detectors .",
    "coifman and kim @xcite proposed a framework based on non - conventional techniques for estimating speed at single - loop detectors , yielding estimates that approach the accuracy of a dual - loop detector s measurements . from these speed estimates ,",
    "the authors obtained a length - based vehicle classification , which they evaluated against concurrent measurements from video and dual - loop detectors .",
    "the traffic state can not be directly measured everywhere , but needs to be interpolated from incomplete , noisy and local traffic data .",
    "commonly , volumes ( flows ) or average vehicle speeds are measured at certain locations in the traffic network , _",
    "e.g. _ , by double induction loop detectors . to estimate the total traffic state from these point measurements , interpolation between the sensors",
    "is necessary .",
    "one of the most widely applied estimation methods is the lighthill - whitham and richards ( lwr ) model @xcite @xcite with an extended kalman filter ( ekf ) .",
    "a large disadvantage of the ekf is that it is too slow to perform in real - time on large networks . to overcome this problem , van hinsbergen _",
    "proposed the localized ekf ( l - ekf ) @xcite . in the l - ekf ,",
    "several local ekfs are sequentially applied , for each cell that contains measurements , instead of using an unique ekf for the entire network .",
    "another interesting approach for traffic state estimation , based on cumulative road acoustics , was proposed by tyagi et al .",
    "the cumulative acoustic signal , acquired from a roadside - installed single microphone , comprises several noise signals  such as tire noise and engine noise . depending on the scenario , noise signals have spectral content that are very different from each other .",
    "hence , they can be used to distinguish between the different traffic density states that lead to them .",
    "the authors extracted the short - term spectral envelope features of the cumulative acoustic signals and modeled their class - conditional probability distributions .",
    "three broad traffic - density states were considered : jammed ( 010 km / h ) , medium - flow ( 1040 km / h ) and free - flow ( 40 km / h and above ) traffic .    to address the problem of sensor spacing optimization , with the objective of minimizing sensor and congestion costs , leow _ et al . _",
    "proposed a novel sampling theorem approach @xcite .",
    "traffic information , such as flow , speed , and density , were obtained from detailed vehicle trajectories , collected by cambridge systematics by means of the next generation simulation ( ngsim ) program .",
    "central to the proposed approach is the shannon sampling theorem @xcite .    in the context of the 2d traffic information signal",
    ", sampling is carried out in both time and space domains . from the power spectral density ( psd ) of traffic information , it is possible to derive the normalized mean - square error ( nmse ) associated with a particular sampling rate . by converting the sampling rate into sensor spacing ,",
    "it is possible to relate the nmse to sensor spacing .",
    "the adoption of vision - based sensing to compute the speeds and length - based classifications of tracked vehicles is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to traditional sensors for collecting traffic data .",
    "this is mainly due to the continuously decreasing cost of cameras and processors .",
    "kanhere and birchfield proposed a taxonomy of the different calibration methods @xcite , dividing them into two categories , depending on whether only a single vanishing point ( v ) or two vanishing points ( vv ) are available . in the presented taxonomy",
    ", the authors introduced several new methods ( vvh , vvl , vlh , vvd , vwd , and vhd ) , in addition to the three already existing methods ( vvw , vwh , and vwl ) . here",
    "w means `` known width '' ( of a lane , or of a vehicle ) , h means `` known height '' ( of the camera ) , l means `` known length '' ( either the distance between pavement markings or the length of a vehicle ) , and d means `` known distance '' ( from the camera to the edge of the road ) .",
    "results show that the methods using a known length outperform the other methods ( including the vvw method ) .",
    "all methods have a better performance when the camera is tilted at least by a moderate amount .      using mobile phones to obtain urban traffic information is motivated by their widespread diffusion , and by the fact that they avoid the installation and maintenance of fixed sensors",
    ". mobile phones continuously send measurement reports to the core of the cellular network .",
    "such measurement reports are related to the radio channel , to help the network in handling resource management tasks , _",
    "e.g. _ , handover decisions . for gsm ,",
    "the output of the radio measurements , associated with each `` connected '' mobile phone , travels on the a - bis interface every @xmath31 ms .",
    "the a - bis interface is linking the bts ( base station ) to the bsc ( base station controller ) .",
    "calabrese _ et al .",
    "_ presented a software platform which enables real - time urban monitoring through the localization of events generated by mobile phones , _",
    "i.e. _ , sms , active call , handover or local area update @xcite .",
    "such a software platform provides four main functional modules :    * _ localization engine _ , estimating the position of each active mobile phone , by extracting the signaling messages from the a - bis interface ; * _ tracking filter _ , estimating the trajectory and the speed of the mobile phones ; * _ mobility state estimator _ , separating the moving phones from the static phones ; * _ traffic map calculator _ , giving the traffic map of the monitored area in a raster map .",
    "valerio _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proved experimentally that real - time road conditions map to signaling patterns in @xmath32 g cellular network , in normal situations and in cases of car accident . the signaling messages are collected from gb and iucs interfaces , with focus on the highway scenario .",
    "traces from the iub interfaces are neglected , as high processing complexity is expected to increase in case of adding iub traces to the traffic estimation process .",
    "the monitoring infrastructure used to collect the traces is composed by tracing unit ( tu ) and processing unit ( pu ) .",
    "network events are collected according to the 3gpp mm ( mobility management ) protocol with the use of three metrics : location area ( la ) for terminals with circuit switching ( cs ) sessions , routing area ( ra ) for terminals with packet switching ( ps ) sessions and cell i d .",
    "two types of events are monitored and then transmitted to the pu : mobility - related events , such as la update and ra update , and activity - related events , such as call setup .",
    "fig  [ fig.probedata2 ] shows a simple architecture of the cellular system with the monitoring framework as implemented by the authors .",
    "the news - feed of the road operator called asfinag , in vienna , has been monitored for potential road anomalies . on february @xmath33th @xmath34 ,",
    "an accident slowed down the traffic . on the same lane of the accident , after few kilometers , there is a border between two different las .",
    "the analysis of the signaling traces depicts the number of users moving from the la where the accident occurred to the following la .",
    "the number of mobile users updating their location decreased suddenly , because they were blocked or slowed down by the accident . when the road traffic was restored , a large number of users changed la in the same time interval counter ( tic ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that using the accumulated la signal technique for accident monitoring in real - time has a critical time response issue . in other words ,",
    "the time needed by the cellular operator to detect the accident after it has already occurred is a critical metric .",
    "it is also to be noted that the estimation of automobile traffic using mobile phones requires a filtering process to distinguish between mobile terminals inside moving vehicles , and terminals carried by pedestrian .",
    "the filtering process is usually based on the calculated speed of connected users .",
    "this process might add complexity and overhead to the traffic estimation .",
    "the expression _ floating car data _ refers to the data being `` continuously '' collected by a fleet of vehicles , called _ probes _",
    "@xcite , which are equipped with gps receivers and gsm / gprs transmitters to collect and send tt data to a dedicated server , in a traffic management center .",
    "two types of floating - data systems are used : 1 ) taxi / bus fcd , where a gps chip transmits it position via a cellular connection to the data - center , and 2 ) mobile - phones fcd , where private mobile phones equipped with gps ( located inside the moving vehicles ) participate into providing floating - data @xcite .",
    "the first type faces the limitation of `` quasi - fixed '' moving patterns of taxis and buses .",
    "the second type needs to deal with particularities regarding privacy issues . unlike the approach based on mobile phones , fcd ( or probe data ) gives few though precise information samples about tt in specific road segments .",
    "the samples collected from probe cars are then used to obtain a global vision of the traffic in the network with the help of analytical methods .",
    "li _ et al .",
    "_ used historical probe car data to discover congestion points @xcite .",
    "the congestion level is evaluated based on real maximum tt between links .",
    "data were collected in beijing by @xmath35 taxis , over 57 days .",
    "the study followed four steps :    1 .",
    "_ building _ a database of real travel speed of links : using @xmath35 taxis , equipped with gps receivers ; 2 .   _ classifying _ the data according to working days and week - end , working - hours and non - working hours ; 3 .   _ identifying _ congestion levels with respect to the previous day and time classifications ( congestion levels are : smooth , light congested and congested )",
    "identifying _ congestion links with an evaluation model which compares the average speed of a link with the average speed of nearby links .",
    "more recently kong _ et al . _ proposed and compared two methods for urban traffic estimation based on probe vehicles : 1 ) a curve - fitting - based method and 2 ) a vehicle - tracking - based method @xcite .",
    "the average speed of the vehicles  which run on a specific road section during a period of time  is used as a metric to represent the traffic state .",
    "the authors compare the two methods regarding the estimation accuracy and the operation speed .",
    "results show that the tracking - based method achieves higher estimation accuracy , but slower operation speed compared with the curve - fitting technique . using the tracking - based method , more than @xmath36% accuracy",
    "can be achieved , whereas the accuracy of the curve - fitting method is always between @xmath37% and @xmath36% . for both methods ,",
    "the accuracy is higher during off - peak hours than during peak hours .",
    "as the distribution of probe vehicles is uneven over space and time , this causes the gathered data to be `` incomplete '' . to solve the issue of missing data from probe vehicles , zhu _",
    "proposed a compressive sensing based algorithm @xcite , which achieves a minimum - error estimation of the traffic condition matrix ( whose rows represent time slots and columns represent road segments ) .",
    "the considered metrics is the average speed of traffic flow on a given link at a certain time slot .",
    "the compressive sensing theory exploits the hidden structures , based on the fact that real world data often contain redundancy .",
    "a measurement matrix , extracted from the measurements performed by the probe vehicles , is used as an input to the algorithms . presented results",
    "show that the estimate error is as low as @xmath9% even for a missing probe data of @xmath36% .    during the last decade ,",
    "several ict researchers designed and analyzed peer - to - peer ( p2p ) @xcite algorithms and overlays for different purposes , such as file sharing , social application , live and on demand streaming and decentralized geolocation services .",
    "distributed localization is a clear example of geocollaboration service , where active users can efficiently discover and disseminate information about existing services ( such as a video stream from a webcam , storage volunteers , and other ) , geo - referenced objects and information ( _ e.g. _ , gasoline station , accident , bad surface conditions , traffic jams ) .",
    "these approaches , combined with mobile phones , allow to build distributed applications to efficiently harvest measuring reports , traffic information and tt in the regions of interest .",
    "they are usually implemented by recursively dividing the 2d space into smaller areas in order to assign responsibilities for region of space to peers .",
    "instead of employing a number of centralized servers ( either dedicated or selected among participating nodes ) to carry the load for the entire network , every node shares the load of indexing and searching data that refers to its area .",
    "geop2p is an architecture that performs a hierarchical partitioning of the 2d geographic space , adopts a fully decentralized peer - to - peer overlay scheme , with overlay maintenance and query routing @xcite .",
    "the system consists of large number of peers , distributed across a 2-dimensional space with rectangular boundary .",
    "each peer is responsible for providing information which is relevant to its location .",
    "a peer can be associated to a single sensor , such as a surveillance camera , or to a database which contains information about the local environment , such are a hotel , or a gas station .",
    "any peer can be interested in any region in the space and send a query .",
    "the purpose of the overlay network is to route queries to relevant peers .",
    "rybicki _ et al .",
    "_ , with peers on wheels @xcite , and more recently with peertis @xcite , proposed p2p architectures where participating cars are peers organized in a distributed hash table ( dht ) , to receive and distribute useful information to improve the vehicle tt using dynamic route guidance . in peertis , roads are divided into segments , each with a unique i d that is used as key in the dht .",
    "the main idea is that each node is responsible for a certain part of the i d space and , consequently , for a certain number of road segments . up to now ,",
    "one of the troubling issues is the fact that obtaining full information about planned and alternative routes is expensive in terms of bandwidth consumption . in peertis",
    "this issue is addressed by means of a modified dht .    a different p2p approach",
    "called distributed geographic table ( dgt ) was proposed by picone _",
    "the dgt is a structured overlay scheme where each participant can efficiently retrieve node or resource information ( data or services ) located near any chosen geographic position . in this approach",
    ", the responsibility for maintaining information about the position of active peers is distributed among nodes .",
    "consequently , a change in the set of participants causes a minimal amount of disruption . a very important aspect of this approach  and , generally , of real - time localization systems  concerns security and privacy . in the dgt ,",

    "other methods based on heuristics , such as tabu search or cellular automata , are more efficient in terms of execution time , at the cost of reduced accuracy and output optimality .    concerning the privacy issue , distributed solutions such as pure vanet approaches and p2p",
    "internet - based overlays ( _ e.g. _ distributed geographic table @xcite ) have the native advantage of evenly distributing the load of the anonymously collected information and the responsibility to maintain it . hence avoiding the risk to centralize all the harvested data in one single knowledge repository .    with the progress in communication technologies , cellular systems , satellite communications and in particular vanets , data collection and dissemination is becoming more comfortable .",
    "vanet functionalities , _",
    "e.g. _ , clustering and data routing , have been remarkably addressed by researchers . nevertheless , effective ( and widely deployed ) utm applications based on vehicular networks still have to come .",
    "it is also to be noted that most of the few works tackling vanet - based utm @xcite @xcite @xcite used of heuristic approaches .",
    "based on the previous inputs , synthesized below :    * the complexity of solving analytical models for large networks , * privacy - related issues , concerning anonymous data collection and storage in a single knowledge repository , * the fast evolution of inter - vehicle communications , hence the potential of using vanet architectures with highly distributed algorithms ,    there is a need , and potential , to further investigate the exploitation of the vanet framework , in order to propose distributed algorithms for the time - consuming models ( either markovian or bayesian ) .",
    "such distributed techniques are expected to provide near - optimal global solutions . to this purpose",
    ", the following steps may be included :    1 .",
    "developing a `` simple '' markovian model , for one intersection , _",
    "e.g. _ the approach proposed by osorio _",
    "@xcite , 2 .",
    "generalizing the model to be able to deal with a large network , while identifying the most time - consuming calculation tasks , 3 .   making use of the vanet architecture , as well as",
    "distributed techniques ( _ e.g. _ distributed machine learning or game theory ) to overcome the time consuming calculations  for example , by placing time consuming tasks at the rsu .    as examples of novel utm applications",
    ", we foresee the usage of vanets to solve the best - route problem for drivers , whether for fleet management services or for individual drivers .",
    "best - route algorithms can also be adapted to solve crisis / evacuation situations .",
    "on the other hand , hybrid vehicular networks is quite a recent topic .",
    "few works exist and there is still some way to go in this area . in the context of hybrid",
    "vehicular  sensor networks , an open research direction is the development of distributed methods for data aggregation / dissemination , while :    * considering two types of data transmissions : data transmission from a static sensor node to a mobile vehicle node and vice versa ; * assuming the vehicles have full knowledge about all locations of static sensor nodes ( e.g. , in a region ) , based on the fact that obus have the storage capability ; * placing the tasks demanding higher processing power at the vehicle nodes .    concerning hybrid vehicular - cellular networks ,",
    "the main motivation behind the idea of integrating vanets and cellular networks is to provide backhaul coverage , hence overcoming the low vehicle density problem .",
    "nevertheless , the high cost of data transmission over the cellular network is still an open issue .",
    "new models are needed to incentivize the cellular operators for the integration of vanets with their networks . in this direction ,",
    "the following research points are still open :    * new business models that consider the pricing plans of cellular users , with the target of incentivizing the cellular operators to participate in its applications ; * inter - rat ( radio access technology ) selection algorithms for the transmitting obus , to allow for a proper choice of their most suitable receiving network , whether the vanet ( _ i.e. _ another obu or rsu ) or the cellular network .    it is worth mentioning that the inter - rat selection algorithms should consider ; the cost of data transmission , the probability of delivering packets to the destination and the end - to - end delay .",
    "in this survey , we reviewed and classified recent research works on the topic of urban traffic management .",
    "estimation / collection of urban traffic information is performed by means of five approaches : analytical methods , fixed sensors , mobile phones , mobile phones combined with gps receivers , and hybrid methods .",
    "we described such approaches and provided examples from the literature for each of them , highlighting their advantages and disadvantages .",
    "as for the urban traffic optimization techniques , we grouped them into two major categories : traffic signal control and vehicle routing control , which we illustrated referring to the literature .",
    "afterwards , we emphasized the role of communication technologies , in particular those enabling vehicular networks , which have been used by the research community to propose highly decentralized intelligent transportation systems .",
    "after a brief introduction to vanets , we divided the architectures serving decentralized its applications into three groups : pure - vanets , hybrid vehicular - sensor networks and hybrid vehicular - cellular networks .",
    "we clarified the motivation of the hybrid architectures , and we discussed their pros and cons .",
    "finally , we concluded our survey by illustrating the main research challenges of the reviewed methods , also providing future research directions .",
