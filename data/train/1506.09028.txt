    "markus bttiker was a person who pioneered the branch of physics presently known as mesoscopics .",
    "many of his predictions were successfully confirmed experimentally and gave birth to new exciting directions in mesoscopics .",
    "one of such predictions directly relates to the topic of the present work .    in 1993",
    "markus bttiker , harry thomas , and anna prtre predicted that the low - frequency dissipative response of a single - channel mesoscopic capacitor is governed by the universal quantity , @xmath0 , the charge relaxation resistance @xcite .",
    "this value is for a single spin channel corresponding to half the value of the von klitzing resistance quantum , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the charge relaxation resistance was suggested to be renamed _ the bttiker resistance _ @xcite , see also the comment in the work by p. p.",
    "hofer , d. dasenbrook , and c. flindt in this special issue .    besides being robust against interactions ,",
    "see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite , one of the key characteristic of this charge relaxation resistance is that it shows up if and only if the electrons conserve their quantum phase coherence while propagating through the sample @xcite . when the bttiker resistance was confirmed experimentally in 2006 using a single - channel mesoscopic capacitor @xcite , it then became clear that this setup could also serve as a coherent source of electrons .",
    "the year after , experimentalists made use of the relatively large energy level spacing in the capacitor to address a single quantum level .",
    "this ability allowed them to operate the mesoscopic capacitor as a single - electron source , _ i.e. _ a source which emits one particle at a time . with this experiment realized in 2007 , ref .",
    "@xcite , experimentalists achieved the emission of a periodic stream of alternating single electrons and single holes .",
    "+ this experiment has then triggered a prolific both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite activity , which constitutes now a fascinating and fast developing sub - field of mesoscopics , which can be called _ quantum coherent electronics_. here quantum refers to the granular nature of charge and emphasizes the fact that the current through the conductor is generated by a flux of well separated wave - packets .",
    "another step was then made theoretically by characterizing the coherence properties of the emitted electrons with the help of the first- and second order correlation functions @xcite , first introduced by glauber in quantum optics .",
    "these works put forward the similar role played by the single - electron source in electronics compared to the already existing single - photon sources in quantum optics .",
    "this analogy also gave rise to an alternative denomination for this sub - field of mesoscopics , electron quantum optics .",
    "the past years have seen the realization of emblematic quantum optic experiments with single - electron sources .",
    "analogs of the hanbury  brown and twiss ( hbt ) experiment @xcite and of the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) experiment @xcite with single electrons were respectively reported in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "another important issue concerning the characterization of these single - electron sources concerns the nature of the quantum state which is emitted .",
    "this step was tackled in an ingenious experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the wave function of a single electron emitted at low temperatures was measured .",
    "this result agrees well with the theoretical expectations from refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the problem we address in the present work is the effect of a finite temperature onto the state emitted by a single - electron source .",
    "this problem is important at least for two reasons .",
    "first , experimentally , the electronic temperature is finite and without a clear understanding of the temperature effect , it is difficult to judge whether a given temperature can be considered as low or high .",
    "second , the experiment from ref .",
    "@xcite and the theory works @xcite show that the shot noise caused by the scattering of single electrons at a quantum point contact gets suppressed with increasing electron temperature .",
    "this effect was explained as a result of antibunching of injected electrons with thermal excitations of the fermi sea @xcite .",
    "as we put forward in this work , there is an alternative interpretation of the shot noise reduction with a temperature increase .",
    "our interpretation exploits the fact that the type of emitted quantum state ( pure or mixed ) is essential for characterizing the suppression or not of the shot noise .",
    "our reasoning is based on the following arguments : on one side , it is known that energy relaxation processes suppress shot noise @xcite . on the other side",
    ", it is also known that when a pure state enters a region where it is subject to relaxation , then it becomes a mixed state .",
    "therefore , a mixed state is expected to produce less shot noise compared to what is produced by a pure state .",
    "previous works have demonstrated that , in general , a pure state at zero temperature becomes mixed at finite temperatures , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we show that this statement is also valid for a quantum state emitted by single - electron sources .",
    "we also demonstrate that temperature - induced mixedness is not equivalent to pure - dephasing induced mixedness with respect to the coherence properties of the emitted quantum state . to this end , we compare an emitted quantum state in presence of finite - temperature and in presence of pure dephasing and emphasize striking differences in the shot noise suppression in an hbt and hom experiments .",
    "indeed , in the latter experiment , the shot noise relies on the phase coherence property between two incident single electrons emitted by different sources when they antibunch .",
    "as soon as these quantum states lose their phase coherence , in presence of pure dephasing , we observe a suppression of the antibunching .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the perfect antibunching at finite - temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase coherence is irrelevant for the shot noise in hbt experiment .",
    "this is why the pure dephasing does not affect it .",
    "in contrast , the energy averaging required at finite temperatures suppresses the shot noise .",
    "we formulate all our results in terms of the first - order correlation function of the emitted single electrons , which allows us to differentiate the effects caused by the suppression of phase coherence and averaging over energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce the excess first - order correlation function @xmath2 , the basic quantity we use to characterize the state emitted by a single - electron source into an electronic waveguide . in the subsequent sec .",

    "the system we have in mind is a single - channel chiral waveguide of non - interacting and spinless electrons originating from a metallic contact .",
    "an electron system of a metallic contact is in equilibrium and is characterized by its fermi distribution function @xmath4 with temperature @xmath5 and chemical potential @xmath6 . as electronic waveguides",

    "<S> we analyze a coherent injection of single electrons on top of the fermi sea in two situations , at finite - temperature and in presence of pure dephasing . both finite - temperature and pure dephasing change the property of the injected quantum states from pure to mixed </S>",
    "<S> . however , we show that the temperature - induced mixedness does not alter the coherence properties of these single - electronic states . in particular two such mixed states exhibit perfect antibunching while colliding at an electronic wave splitter . </S>",
    "<S> this is in striking difference with the dephasing - induced mixedness which suppresses antibunching . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , a single - particle shot noise is suppressed at finite temperatures but is not affected by pure dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> this work therefore extends the investigation of the coherence properties of single - electronic states to the case of mixed states and clarifies the difference between different types of mixedness .    </S>",
