    "the pervasive and serious nature of cracks in materials and structures means that the computational modelling of crack propagation continues to be a critical area of research , and a major challenge .",
    "this paper presents a finite element based computational framework for modelling brittle crack propagation in elastic three - dimensional solids , based on the concept of configurational mechanics .",
    "the focus of this paper is on both the mathematical formulation and the computational framework to model and continuously resolve propagating cracks in a robust and computationally tractable manner .",
    "this paper is concerned with quasi - static problems where the influence of inertia is ignored . a sequel to this paper",
    "will demonstrate the extension of this work to dynamic fracture .",
    "the concept of configurational mechanics dates back to the original work of eshelby and his study of forces acting on continuum defects  @xcite .",

    "a configurational change is exhibited as an advancing crack front . to formulate the crack propagation problem ,",
    "two related kinematic descriptions are defined in the spatial and material settings . in the former ,",
    "the classical conservation law of linear momentum balance is described , where newtonian forces are work conjugate to changes in the spatial position , at fixed material position ( i.e. no crack propagation ) . in the material setting , which represents a dual to the spatial setting , an equivalent conservation law is described , where configurational forces are conjugate to changes in material position but with no spatial motion .",
    "this decomposition of the behaviour is proven to be a simple but powerful methodology for describing crack propagation .",
    "the spatial and material displacements fields are both discretised using the same finite element mesh , although we adopt different levels of approximation for the two fields .",
    "the resulting discretised weak form of the two conservation equations represent a set of coupled , nonlinear , algebraic equations that are solved in a monolithic manner using a newton - raphson scheme .",
    "in addition , an arc - length method , using crack area rather than displacements as a constraint , is adopted to trace the dissipative load path .",
    "the resulting stress - free crack is represented as a displacement discontinuity , requiring the finite element mesh to resolve the crack and to be continuously adapted as the crack front advances .",
    "in contrast to other approaches , where the mesh is modified in order to resolve the incremental crack front advancement  @xcite , in this paper we establish an equilibrium condition for the nodal configurational forces acting on the crack front that enables the crack front to advance in a continuous manner . in order to maintain mesh quality , smoothing of the mesh",
    "is undertaken as a continuous process , together with face flipping , node merging and edge splitting where necessary . with this methodology , it is important to note that there is no need to post - process stresses to determine if the crack should propagate and the crack front shape is calculated based purely on the physical equations .",
    "three numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the ability of the formulation to accurately predict crack paths without bias from the original mesh .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows an elastic body with an initial crack in the reference material domain . as a result of loading , the crack extends and the body deforms elastically .",
    "it is convenient to decompose this behaviour into a purely configurational change , i.e. crack extension , which is described by the mapping from the reference material domain to the current material domain ( @xmath0 ) , followed by elastic deformation only , described by the mapping from the current material to spatial domain ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "the piola - kirchhoff stress is the familiar driving force for elastic deformation in the spatial domain , whereas the eshelby stress is its material counterpart and the driving force for local configurational changes .",

    "it should be noted that for a continuous elastic body comprising an homogeneous material , the configurational forces @xmath68 within the volume , away from the crack front , should be zero .",
    "since all energy dissipation is restricted to creation of new crack surfaces , it follows that the local form of the second law is given as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the dissipation of energy per unit length of the crack front .",
    "this inequality restricts evolution of the crack to positive crack area growth at each point of the crack front .",
    "although the first law defines if the crack front is in equilibrium and the second law places restrictions on the direction of crack evolution , it does not determine how @xmath42 or @xmath41 evolves . in the next section we supplement the second law with a crack growth criterion .",
    "a straightforward criterion for crack growth , in the spirit of griffith , is proposed : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a material parameter specifying the critical threshold of energy release per unit area of the crack surface @xmath19 . for a point on the crack front to be in equilibrium",

    "it is enforced if , for a given node , there exists an adjacent edge with a length less than @xmath113 of the length of the longest edge adjacent to the node .",
    "face flipping is applied to elements in the vicinity of the crack front to ensure that a 3d delaunay triangulation exists , with optimal internal angles .",
    "this is described in more detail in section  [ face_flip ] below .",
    "these procedures are utilised , if necessary , at the beginning of each load step , before the newton - raphson iterations begin , when the solution is already out of equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , in the case when new nodes are added , variables are transferred to the new mesh based upon approximation of the variables using the old mesh .",

    "although this measure does not directly determine dihedral angles , it has been shown to be very effective at eliminating poor angles , thus improving stiffness matrix conditioning and reducing interpolation errors @xcite .",
    "as the volume - length measure is a smooth function of node positions , and its gradient is straightforward and computationally inexpensive to calculate , it is ideal for the problem at hand .",
    "the volume - length quality measure is defined as @xmath118 where @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the element quality , element volume and root mean square of the element s edge lengths respectively , in the reference configuration .",
