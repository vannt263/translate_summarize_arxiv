    "the nature of the odderon  an asymptotic odd-@xmath5 regge pole exchange , counterpart of the pomeron  for a long time remains a subject of debate .",
    "although there is little doubt about its existence , we still lack direct evidence of the odderon .",
    "various reactions supposedly dominated by odderon exchanges , called  odderon filters \" @xcite , may offer only indirect evidence either because of low statistics or contamination by competing exchanges .    in quantum chromodynamics",
    "the odderon corresponds to the exchange of an odd number of gluons .",
    "relevant calculations were done in a number of papers ; see @xcite and earlier references therein .    the only direct way to see the odderon is by comparing particle and antiparticle scattering at high enough energies .",
    "the high - energy proton - proton and proton - antiproton elastic scattering amplitude is a difference or sum of even and odd @xmath5-parity contributions , @xmath6 where , essentially , the even part consists of the pomeron and @xmath7 reggeon , while the odd part contains the odderon and the @xmath8 reggeon .",
    "it is clear from the above formula that the odd component of the amplitude can be extracted from the difference of the proton - antiproton and proton - proton scattering amplitudes , and , since at high enough energies the contributions from secondary regge trajectories die out , this difference offers a direct way of extracting the odderon contribution .",
    "unfortunatelly , @xmath0 and @xmath9 elasctic scatterings were typically measured at different @xmath10 , with the exception of the isr energies of 31 , 53 , 62 gev ( see fig . [",
    "fig : accelarators ] ) .",
    "[ 1]s accelerator , the @xmath0 and the @xmath11 elastic scattering data were measured at the same @xmath12 31 , 53 and 62 gev .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=377 ]    at present , the only way to extract the odderon from the difference of the @xmath3 and @xmath0 scattering amplitudes is by means of a reliable interpolation of both amplitudes ( or cross sections ) over the missing energy regions . while the energy dependence of the forward amplitude ( or total cross sections ) is controlled by the regge pole theory , its @xmath1 dependence , especially in the dip - bump region , to a large extent is model dependent and unpredictable .",
    "a simple , general , and reliable parametrization of the complicated diffraction structure at high energies at any fixed energy is a sum of two exponentials in @xmath1 related by a complex phase @xmath13 using this generic expression , phillips and barger ( pb )  @xcite ( for brevity we shall refer to it as the pb ansatz ) obtained good fits to the proton - proton differential cross sections , including the dip - bump region at several cern isr fixed energies . in refs .",
    "@xcite the model was extended and improved , in particular , by accounting for the nonexponential behavior in the low @xmath14 region . in ref .",
    "@xcite the parametrization was shown to be applicable to proton - antiproton scattering as well .",
    "its connection with inelastic reactions is discussed on p. 185 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the pb ansatz reads @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath1 are the standard mandelstam variables ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 were fitted to each energy independently ; i.e. , energy dependence in the pb ansatz enters parametrically .",
    "the success of the simple pb parametrization motivates its further improvement , extension , and utilization . in papers @xcite the low-@xmath14 behavior of the pb ansatz was improved by modifying its simple exponential behavior by ( a ) inclusion of a two - pion threshold required by analyticity and ( b ) by means of a multiplicative factor reflecting the proton form factor . achieving good fits to the totem data @xcite , at the lhc energies of @xmath18 tev",
    ", the modified ansatz was used to predict the behavior of the observables at future energies as well as the expected asymptotic behavior of the cross sections .",
    "the model was also tested in @xcite against the totem data @xcite , and , contrary to many alternative models , it works reasonably well . in ref .",
    "@xcite the pb ansatz eq .",
    "( [ barger ] ) was improved ; in particular , its small-@xmath1 behavior was modified .",
    "the fitted parameters are collected in table ii of that paper . for example , the authors of @xcite quote the following values for these parameters for @xmath0 scattering at @xmath19 gev : @xmath20 in @xmath21 and @xmath22 in gev@xmath23 .",
    "as already mentioned , in addition to elastic @xmath0 scattering , the pb ansatz also describes @xmath11 data , with a different set of the parameters ( see below ) , thus opening the way to be used as a tool in extracting the odderon from the difference of the two .",
    "however , in its original form , the pb ansatz does not describe the @xmath4 dependence of the model parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we try to remedy this limitation by combining the appealingly simple and efficient form of its @xmath1 dependence with energy dependence inspired by the regge pole model .",
    "work in this direction was started in papers @xcite .",
    "we address the following issues : ( 1 ) we smoothly interpolate between the values of the parameters fitted at fixed energy values , ( 2 ) extract the odderon contribution from the difference of the @xmath9 and @xmath0 cross sections , and ( 3 ) compare the energy dependence of this difference with the prediction @xcite based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics , by which the intercept of the odderon trajectory equal to one .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in the next section , we introduce the @xmath4 dependence of the parameters of the pb model , which in the next section are determined from the fits to data .",
    "then we discuss the results , in particular the @xmath4 dependence of the results , including , for example , the odderon contribution and the odderon / pomeron ratio .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude .",
    "we use the norm where @xmath24\\ ] ] and @xmath25.\\ ] ]    following the regge pole theory , we make the following assignment , @xmath26 inspired by the donnachie and landshoff model @xcite of cross sections [ see eq .",
    "( [ norm1 ] ) ] with effective falling ( subleading reggeons ) and rising ( pomeron ) components .",
    "it follows from our fits that the falling ( subleading reggeon ) components in @xmath27 are small ; hence , they are neglected .",
    "the slopes @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the regge pole theory are unambiguously logarithmic in @xmath2 , providing shrinkage of the cone : @xmath30 in the above formulae a normalization factor @xmath31 gev@xmath32 is implied .    the phase @xmath17 is the weakest point of this  toy \" model or generalized pb model . in regge theory , it should depend on @xmath1 rather than on @xmath2 .",
    "fortunately , at high @xmath10 the dependence of @xmath17 on energy is weak ( see the fits below ) .",
    "however , this is not the case as the energy decreases . the best we can do is to fit the data with @xmath33 the  low \"- energy behavior is a weak point in any case .",
    "apart from the varying phase , we must account in some way for the subleading ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) reggeon contributions .",
    "this is done partly by the inclusion in @xmath34 of a decreasing term ( absent in @xmath27 ) .",
    "a complete treatment of these terms with proper @xmath1-dependent signatures will require a radical revision of the model , and we hope to come back to this issue in the future .",
    "now we proceed with this simple approach that has a chance to be viable at high energies , where the pomeron and odderon dominate @xcite and the above complications may be insignificant .    to understand better the existence of any connection between the ansatz ( [ barger ] ) and the regge pole model , we plot the values of the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 against @xmath2 and fit their  experimental \" values to regge - like formulas .",
    "this can be done in two complementary ways : a successive  two - step \" fit .",
    "first , we acquire the values of the parameters @xmath35 from the fits to the @xmath0 and @xmath9 data , then we fit their regge forms ( see below ) to the obtained  experimental \" values of @xmath35 .",
    "alternatively , one may determine the parameters of eqs .",
    "( [ ac ] ) and ( [ bd ] ) from a single simultaneous fit to all available data .",
    "we chose the first option ( 5 parameters ) since otherwise there were too many ( at least 12 ) free parameters .",
    "thus , we proceed with a two - step fit , by which the final values are determined from a fit to the  experimental \" values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we fitted separately @xmath0 and @xmath36 in two variables , @xmath2 and @xmath37 by using @xmath0 and @xmath36 data on total and differential cross sections ranging from the isr to the lhc for @xmath0 and from s@xmath38s to the tevatron for @xmath9 .    here",
    "the following remarks are in order :    \\(1 ) it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ ac ] ) and ( [ bd ] ) that , while the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath5 are particularly sensitive to the data on total cross sections , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are correlated mainly with the differential cross sections ( the slopes ) .",
    "\\(2 ) although we are interested mainly in the high - energy behavior ( the odderon ) , low - energy effects can not be fully neglected .",
    "they are taken into account approximately by including in @xmath39 and @xmath5 subleading terms of the type @xmath40 .",
    "\\(3 ) having fitted @xmath16 and @xmath41 we perform a cross - check by calculating the resulting total cross sections .",
    "\\(4 ) at high energies , the proton - proton and antiproton - proton total cross sections are supposed to converge .",
    "( we consider only this simple option , although we are aware of alternatives . ) since the existing data are not yet in this asymptotic domain , we introduce an extra constraint .",
    "\\(5 ) the most delicate issue is the phase , which in regge phenomenology is expected to be @xmath1 , rather than @xmath2 , dependent .",
    "our fits ( and those of @xcite ) show considerable energy dependence of the phase at low energies but weak dependence at high energies , where we are particularly interested in looking for the odderon signal . postponing the introduction of a true regge - pole - motivated , @xmath1-dependent phase to a further study , here we assume a simple parametrization @xmath42 .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath2 dependence of the parameters using a fitting strategy consisting of three consecutive steps described in detail below . in doing so , the following criteria were applied :    * best @xmath43 for each fit ; * the @xmath44 range was set within @xmath45-@xmath46 gev@xmath32 ; * for each fixed energy , the model was fitted simultaneously to @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( focusing on the dip region ) ; * from the resulting fits , @xmath48 was reconstructed in the whole available energy range .",
    "the values of the fitted parameters , in general , are consistent , within about 30% , with those obtained in refs .",
