    "proposals to measure tau neutrino fluxes , e.g. , @xmath0 followed by @xmath1 decay ( via the double bang signal [ 1 ] or either the tau production or decay vertex ) are possible in the 1 - 10 pev neutrino energy range [ 2 ] . for higher energies , above about 20 pev",
    ", taus may be considered quasi - stable particles , in that their decay lengths are larger than the size of the detector .",
    "muons are quasi - stable particles on the scale of 1 km even for energies in the gev range .    recently , supersymmetry models with weak scale supersymmetry breaking [ 3 ] have led to studies of quasi - stable stau ( @xmath2 ) signals in neutrino telescopes [ 4 - 7 ] . in these studies ,",
    "pairs of staus come from the decays of supersymmetric particles produced by neutrinos interacting in the earth .",
    "the signature would be a pair of tracks from charged particles , the staus , passing through the detector .",
    "neutrino production of supersymmetric particles is suppressed , but the signal can be enhanced by the large effective volume of the detector , characterised by the cross sectional area of the detector multiplied by the range of the staus .",
    "electromagnetic energy loss is a key feature of charged particle ranges for muons , high energy taus and high energy staus . on average , the energy loss per unit distance is @xmath3 where @xmath4 gev @xmath5/g is due to ionization energy loss , while @xmath6 depends on the mass of the traveling particle with contributions from bremsstrahlung , @xmath7 pair production and photonuclear interactions . for muons , @xmath8 @xmath5/g , while for taus , @xmath9 @xmath5/g .",
    "schematically , for staus , @xmath10 we have evaluated the energy loss parameter @xmath6 for staus more quantitatively in ref .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 can be converted to a distance scale by multiplying by a density . for the figures below , the density @xmath11 g/@xmath12 is for standard rock .",
    "there is a weak energy dependence for the @xmath6 parameters for each of the particles . for taus , @xmath13 km at a pev and decreases with energy .",
    "muons have a characteristic distance of @xmath14 km .",
    "staus , on the other hand , have @xmath15 km for @xmath16 pev .",
    "another characteristic distance relevant to muon , tau and stau propagation through ice , water or rock is the weak interaction length . for @xmath17 gev ,",
    "the tau charged - current interaction length is of order @xmath18 km .",
    "the muon and stau interaction lengths are of the same order of magnitude . by comparing to @xmath19 , we see that weak interactions are potentially important for staus , but not for taus . for muons ,",
    "the distance scales are even further separated , so we confine our discussion to taus and staus .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the weak interaction contributions to stau energy loss in the earth .",
    "we have evaluated the range of taus and staus , for specific susy model parameter choices , using a monte carlo simulation including stochastic energy loss . in the last section ,",
    "we compare the stau ranges with and without including weak interactions based on the monte carlo simulation results .",

    "the charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) interactions of taus are related to neutrino interactions , with the appropriate substitution of couplings and the tau spin average .",
    "stau weak interaction cross sections depend on the stau mass , the relation between the stau mass eigenstates and the partners of the left - handed and right - handed taus and the scalar couplings with the @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in these models , the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle is the stau with @xmath23 we take @xmath24 to be a free parameter . for both nc and cc stau interactions ,",
    "the couplings depend on @xmath24 .    in fig . 1",
    ", we show the nc cross section for neutrinos , taus , muons and staus ( @xmath25 gev ) picking @xmath26 .",
    "we show this range of masses to give an indication of the dependence on the stau mass .",
    "lep experiments constrain the stau mass to be larger than @xmath27 gev [ 8 ] .",
    "2 shows the cc cross section for the same incident particles , this time for staus with @xmath20 , the maximal value . if @xmath28 , the cc cross section for staus vanishes .",
    "electromagnetic and nc interactions act the same way , in that they reduce the initial energy of the incident particle to a lower energy . for taus , and even for staus , the nc energy loss is small compared to the electromagnetic energy loss .",
    "in what follows we neglect the nc interactions .",
    "the cc interaction , however , is important for staus if @xmath20 .",
    "the cc interaction removes staus from the incident flux .",
    "for taus , the cc interaction is not important compared to the electromagnetic energy loss , as we show in the next section .",
    "in this section , we show results for the range for taus and staus and the effect of cc interactions [ 9 ] . for taus , one approach has been to look at the different scales : the decay length , @xmath29 and the charged current interaction length @xmath30 [ 10 ] . here ,",
    "instead , we show the results for a full stochastic treatment of tau energy loss including weak interactions [ 11,12 ] .",
    "the range for taus in rock is shown with the solid lines in fig .",
    "3 . the dashed lines show the characteristic scales . with the exception of the decay length for low energies",
    ", none of the characteristic scales aligns with the range . for electromagnetic energy loss ,",
    "this is not surprising since @xmath29 is not a solution to eq .",
    "the cc interaction length is long compared to the tau range determined from electromagnetic interactions alone , so its effect is not visible on the scale of this figure .",
    "4 shows the characteristic scales ( dashed lines ) for a stau traveling through rock .",
    "the stau mass is 150 gev and the decay parameter is @xmath31 gev for this figure , where @xmath32 for this choice of @xmath33 , ionization energy loss characterized by the distance scale @xmath34 is relevant while @xmath35 is not .",
    "the minimum energy of the stau for evaluating the range is @xmath36 gev in fig .",
    "the upper solid line shows the range when @xmath37 , namely , no cc interactions affect the range .",
    "the lower solid line shows the effect of including maximal cc interactions .",

    "we have shown here that the characteristic scales do not give an accurate picture of the range of staus or taus .",
    "for taus , the characteristic scale of the cc interaction length does show that the tau range is mainly unaffected by cc interactions , even at @xmath38 gev , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . the stochastic treatment of the staus is essential , however , for a determination of the stau range . because of electromagnetic energy loss , the stau range is not equal to the cc interaction length .",
    "even when @xmath20 , the range is larger than @xmath39 at high energies because electromagnetic interactions degrade the stau energy , and @xmath39 increases with decreasing energy .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "4 show that generically for neutrino telescopes sensitive to fluxes below @xmath40 gev , maximal weak interactions of the staus will have a small numerical impact on the event rate . on the other hand",
