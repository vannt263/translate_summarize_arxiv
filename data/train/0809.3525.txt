    "switching between the states require large fluctuations that would allow the system to overcome the activation barrier .",
    "such large fluctuations are rare .",
    "however , they lead to large changes in the system behavior .",
    "fluctuational switching between coexisting states plays a crucial role in a variety of systems and phenomena including nanomagnets @xcite , josephson junctions @xcite , protein folding @xcite , and chemical reactions .    a detailed theory of switching rates was first developed by kramers @xcite .",
    "the analysis referred to systems close to thermal equilibrium , where the switching rate is determined by the free energy barrier between the states .",
    "the concept of this barrier is well understood and the barrier height has been found for many models .",
    "however , in recent years much attention has been given to switching in systems far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "examples include electrons @xcite and atoms @xcite in modulated traps , rf - driven josephson junctions @xcite and nano- and micromechanical resonators @xcite .",
    "apart from fundamental interest , switching in modulated systems is important for many applications , quantum measurements being an example @xcite .",
    "nonequilibrium systems generally lack detailed balance , and the switching rates may not be found by a simple extension of the kramers approach .    a basic ,",
    "although somewhat counterintuitive , physical feature of large infrequent fluctuations leading to switching is that , in such fluctuations , the system is most likely to move along a certain path in its phase space .",
    "this path is known as the most probable switching path ( mpsp ) . for low fluctuation intensity",
    ", the mpsp is obtained by the solution of a variational problem .",
    "this problems also determines the switching activation barrier @xcite . despite its central role for the understanding of fluctuation - induced switching and switching rates ,",
    "the idea of the mpsp has not been tested experimentally in multivariable systems .",
    "the question of how the paths followed in switching are distributed in phase space has not been asked either .",
    "perhaps closest to addressing the above issues was the experiment on dropout events in a semiconductor laser with optical feedback @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the switching path distribution in space and time was measured and calculated .",
    "however , the system was characterized by only one dynamic variable , and thus all paths lie on one line in phase space . in another effort , electronic circuit simulations",

    "the methods @xcite do not apply to the switching path distribution in multivariable systems , as explained below .    in the present paper",
    "we introduce the concept of switching path distribution in phase space and the quantity that describes this distribution , calculate this quantity , and report the direct observation of the tube of switching paths .",

    "the physical picture of switching is as follows .",

    "including those leading to switching between the states .",
    "the switching rate @xmath9 from state @xmath1 to @xmath2 is much less than the reciprocal relaxation time @xmath10 , that is , the system fluctuates about @xmath1 for a long time , on the scale of @xmath5 , before a transition to @xmath2 occurs . in the transition",

    "this factor arises because of the motion slowing down near the saddle point .",
    "the time @xmath25 is much smaller than the reciprocal switching rates , and the smaller the fluctuation intensity the stronger the difference , because the dependence of @xmath27 on the fluctuation intensity is of the activation type .",
