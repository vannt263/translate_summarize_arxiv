    "it has recently been shown @xcite that the classical dynamics of the spatial scale factors ( and of the dilatons if any ) of @xmath1-dimensional gravity coupled to @xmath2-forms can be described , in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity , as a billiard motion , i.e. as the relativistic motion of a ball inside a region of hyperbolic space bounded by hyperplanes on which it undergoes elastic bounces .",
    "these results generalize the work by belinskii , khalatnikov and lifshitz ( bkl ) @xcite that discovered the chaotic behaviour of the generic solution of the vacuum einstein equation , in four dimensional spacetime , near such a singularity .",
    "these authors showed that , near a spacelike singularity , a decoupling of the spatial points occurs which hugely simplifies the dynamical equations of the spatial metric , in the sense that , asymptotically , they cease to be partial differential equations to simply become , at each spatial point , a set of second - order non linear ordinary differential equations with respect to time .",
    "these equations coincide with the dynamical equations of some spatially homogeneous cosmological models which possess some of the qualitative properties of more generic solutions . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the spatially homogeneous vacuum models that share the chaotic behaviour of the more general inhomogeneous solutions are labelled as bianchi type ix and viii ; their homogeneity groups are respectively @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in higher spacetime dimensions ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath6 , one also knows chaotic spatially homogeneous cosmological models but none of them is diagonal @xcite .",
    "in fact , diagonal models are too restrictive to be able to reproduce the general oscillatory behaviour but , as shown e.g. in @xcite , chaos is restored when non - diagonal metric elements are taken into account .    a systematic way to study the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of einstein s equations in the neighborhood of a spacelike singularity and in any spacetime dimension",
    "is provided by the hamiltonian approach developed in @xcite in which gravity is coupled to a collection of @xmath2-forms . in this framework ,",
    "a billiard description of the asymptotic evolution of the scale factors is naturally set up and chaos follows from the fact that the billiard s volume is finite . in many interesting examples , some of them related to supergravity models @xcite , the billiard can be identified with the fundamental weyl chamber of a kac - moody algebra and the reflections against the billiard walls with the fundamental weyl reflections which generate the weyl group ( or coxeter group ) : accordingly , the finiteness of the volume , hence also chaos , rely upon the hyperbolic character of the underlying kac - moody algebra ; this last property is established through its cartan matrix or equivalently in its dynkin diagram .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyse the billiard evolution of spatially homogeneous non - diagonal cosmological models in @xmath3 or @xmath7 spacetime dimensions , in the hamiltonian formalism mentionned hereabove . since one knows that the full field content of the theory is important in the characterization of the billiard , we compare the pure einstein gravity construction to that of the coupled einstein - maxwell system .",
    "the gravitational models we are interested in are in a one - to - one correspondence with the real lie algebras - a complete classification based on their structure constants exists for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10@xcite - and we restrict our analysis to the unimodular ones , because only for such models can the symmetries of the metric be prescribed at the level of the action .",
    "we proceed along the lines defined in @xcite but with a special concern about the rle played by the constraints . indeed , while in the general inhomogeneous case , the constraints essentially assign limitations on the spatial gradients of the fields without having an influence on the generic form of the bkl hamiltonian , in the present situation , they precisely relate the coefficients that control the walls in the potential .",
    "consequently , the question arises whether they can enforce the disappearing of some ( symmetry or electric or magnetic ) walls as already do the vanishing structure constants with gravitational walls .",
    "they could prevent the generic oscillatory behaviour of the scale factors .",
    "the answer evidently depends on the lie algebra considered and on its dimension : for example , while going from the bianchi ix model in @xmath8 to the corresponding @xmath11 model in @xmath9 , the structure constants remain the same but the momentum constraints get less restrictive .",
    "hence generic behaviour is easier to reach when more variables enter the relations .",
    "we find that , except for the bianchi ix and viii cases in @xmath3 , symmetry walls ( hence off - diagonal elements ) are needed to close the billiard table : thereby confirming , in the billiard picture , previous results about chaos restoration .",
    "moreover , we find that when the billiard has a finite volume in hyperbolic space , it can again be identified with the fundamental weyl chamber of one of the hyperbolic kac - moody algebras . in the most generic situation , these algebras coincide with those already relevant in the general inhomogeneous case .",
    "however , in special cases , new rank 3 or 4 simply laced algebras are exhibited .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first adapt to the spatially homogeneous case that part of the general hamiltonian formalism set up in @xcite necessary to understand how , at the bkl limit , the billiard walls arise in the potential .",
    "we explicitly write down the form of the momentum constraints in the generalized iwasawa variables and analyse their meaning for each of the 3 and 4 real unimodular lie algebras as well as their impact on the billiard s shape . for the finite volume billiards ,",
    "we compute the scalar products of the gradients of the dominant walls using the metric defined by the kinetic energy and show that the matrix a_ab = 2 ( w_aw_b ) = g^abw_aa w_bb is the generalized cartan matrix of an hyperbolic kac - moody algebra .",
    "in this paper , we are specially interested in @xmath8 and @xmath9 dimensional spatially homogeneous models equipped with a homogeneity group simply transitively acting ; these models are known to be in a one - to - one correspondence with the @xmath12 and @xmath13 dimensional real lie algebras and have been completely classified@xcite . we restrict our analysis to the unimodular algebras , i.e. those whose adjoint representation is traceless , that is @xmath14 , since only for these homogeneous models do the equations of motion follow from a reduced hamiltonian action in which the symmetry of the metric is enforced before taking variationnal derivatives .",
    "we work in a pseudo - gaussian gauge defined by vanishing shift @xmath15 and assume the @xmath16 dimensional spacetime metric of the form ds^2 = - ( n dx^0)^2 + g_ij(x^0 ) ^i^jwhere @xmath17 is the time coordinate , @xmath18 is the proper time , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the lapse . for definiteness and in agreement with the choice made in @xcite , we will assume that the spatial singularity occurs in the past , for @xmath21 .",
    "the gravitational dynamical variables @xmath22 are the components of the @xmath23 dimensional spatial metric in the time - independent co - frame @xmath24 invariant under the group transformations d^i = -c^i_jk^j^k;the @xmath25 s are the group structure constants .",
    "the metric @xmath26 depends only on time and may contain off - diagonal elements . with use of @xmath27 ,",
    "one defines the rescaled lapse as @xmath28 .    in the spatially homogeneous einstein - maxwell system",
    ", there is besides the metric , an electromagnetic @xmath29-form potential @xmath30 and its @xmath31-form field strength @xmath32 . in the temporal gauge @xmath33",
    ", the potential reduces to a = a_j^j.in the hamiltonian framework , we assume the potential itself to be spatially homogeneous so that its space components in the @xmath34 frame are functions of @xmath17 only : @xmath35 . accordingly",
    ", its field strength takes the special form f= da = _ 0 a_jdx^0^j - a_ic^i_jk^j^kwhich shows the links between the components of the magnetic field and the structure constants .",
    "hence , from the jacobi identity , one infers that f_i[jc^i_k ] = 0.[cmag ]    the first order action for the homogeneous einstein - maxwell system can be obtained from the @xmath1 dimensional hilbert - einstein action in adm form after space integration has been carried out ; this operation brings in a constant space volume factor that will be ignored hereafter .",
    "the action is given by s[g_ij,^ij , a_j,^j ] = dx^0 ( ^ijg_ij + ^ja_j - n h ) .[action]the",
    "hamiltonian @xmath36 reads as & = & k + m + k & = & ^ij_ij-^i_i^j_j+^j _ j +   m & = & -gr + f_ijf^ijwhere @xmath37 is the spatial curvature scalar defined , in the unimodular cases , by the following combination of structure constants and metric coefficients r = - ( c^ijkc_jik + c^ijkc_ijk ) , where c_ijk = g_ic^_jkc^ijk = g^jg^kmc^i_m.[struc2 ]    the equations of motion are obtained by varying the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the spatial metric components @xmath22 , the spatial @xmath29-form components @xmath38 and their respective conjugate momenta @xmath39 and @xmath40 . the dynamical variables still obey the following constraints : & & 0 + h_i&= & - c^j_ik^k_j+ ^j f_ij0;[momentum ] notice that the gauss law for the electric field is identically satisfied on account of the unimodularity condition .",
    "in order to develop the billiard analysis , it is necessary to change the variables , i.e. to replace the metric components @xmath22 by the new variables @xmath41 and @xmath42 , defined through the iwasawa matrix decomposition @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an upper triangular matrix with @xmath29 s on the diagonal and @xmath45 is a diagonal matrix with positive entries parametrized as @xmath46 the explicit form of ( [ iwas ] ) reads g_ij = _",

    "thus h = h_0 + vand h_0 = g^ab_a_b.the total",

    "@xmath66 vanishes in the case of pure diagonal @xmath22 .",
    "next comes the gravitational or curvature potential v_g = - gr = e^-2_d ^d_a , b , c ( e^2^cc^a_bcc^b_ac + e^-2^a + 2^b + 2^c(c^a_bc)^2 ) involving the structure constants in the iwasawa basis defined by ( [ struc ] ) .",

    "as explained in @xcite , with the following gauge choice , @xmath70 , and in the bkl limit corresponding to @xmath71 , the exponentials terms in the potential @xmath72 become sharp walls and may be replaced by _ [ c_a^2e^-2 w_a ( ) ] = _",

    "accordingly , in this limit , the positive @xmath68 s can be absorbed by the @xmath73 and the null ones can simply be dropped out ; once this has been done , the hamiltonian no longer depends on the variables @xmath74 \\{n , p , e , f}that enter these coefficients .",
    "this also means that the bkl hamiltonian only contains the scale factors @xmath41 and their conjugate momenta @xmath75 hence , as can be immediately infered from their equations of motion , all the @xmath74 s must asymptotically tend to constants .",
    "these constants are arbitrary untill and unless the constraints enter the play .",
    "another way to see that , before the constraints are taken into account , the asymptotic values of the @xmath74 s are arbitrary constants is to consider the map : _ 0^=",
    "( _ 0)which sends the initial values @xmath76 on their asymptotic bkl values , for a given set of initial data @xmath77 , and to use the fact that , at least locally , this map must be invertible .",
    "this statement is clearly true for an hamiltonian which does not at all depend on the @xmath74 s .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this property remains valid in the more difficult situation that we face here , where the @xmath74 s only asymptotically get out of the hamiltonian .    in the general inhomogeneous case , the constraints are essentially conditions on the space gradients of the dynamical variables and , as such",
    ", they introduce no limitation on the generic bkl hamiltonian : that s why generically the hamiltonian contains all the walls .",
    "the same happens of course when the constraints are absent . in the spatial homogeneity context",
    ", however , they have to be taken into account since they can influence the billiard s shape . of course",
    ", the prefactors controling the presence of the curvature walls crucially depend on the homogeneity group under consideration : the more the group `` looks '' abelian , the less curvature walls are present . the momentum constraints further establish linear relations between the other wall coefficients @xmath68 s in which all together the structure constants , the @xmath74 s and even the variables @xmath78 are mixed up ; so the question arises whether , asymptotically , they are equivalent to the condition that some of the @xmath68 s vanish forcing the corresponding walls to disappear .",
