    "classical cepheids are among the most important variable stars . as primary distance indicators ,",
    "they are of key importance for stellar astrophysics , galactic astrophysics and cosmology . because of the very characteristic light curve shape , large amplitude variation and high intrinsic brightness , long - period fundamental mode pulsators are the most useful standard candles .",
    "they are also believed to be very regular pulsators , without any large - amplitude modulation of pulsation or additional non - radial modes excited .    to the contrary ,",
    "first overtone cepheids are less stable .",
    "irregular and often fast changes of pulsation period are more common among first overtone than among fundamental mode stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and , according to model proposed by @xcite , are interpreted as due to non - radial modes of moderate degrees .",
    "@xcite reported modulation in several double - overtone cepheids ( simultaneously pulsating in the first and second radial overtones ) of the magellanic clouds .",
    "recently , @xcite also reported modulation of pulsation in a few classical cepheids in the magellanic clouds .",
    "these are either double - overtone pulsators or single - periodic , first overtone pulsators .",
    "in addition , v473  lyr is a very peculiar variable , identified as a second overtone classical cepheid with modulation ( for the recent analysis see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "precise space photometry indicates , that tiny cycle - to - cycle irregularities might occur in classical cepheids of both modes .",
    "@xcite detected cycle - to - cycle fluctuations in the pulsation period ( of up to @xmath12d ) in v1154  cyg  the only genuine cepheid in the original _ kepler _ field @xcite .",
    "light curve stability was studied in two classical cepheids observed with _",
    "cycle - to - cycle light curve variation , more pronounced for first overtone pulsator was detected .",
    "v1154  cyg was revisited by @xcite and @xcite who reported the periodic ( @xmath13d ) modulation of the light curve shape .",
    "the effect is tiny  amplitude of the highest modulation peak in the frequency spectrum reported by @xcite is @xmath14mmag .",
    "long - period modulation is also suspected in fundamental mode cepheid t  vul , which was observed with _",
    "constellation @xcite .",
    "radial velocity measurements also suggest possible modulation in the pulsation of classical cepheids .",
    "@xcite studied the radial velocities for two first overtone cepheids and detected smooth variation of the amplitude and shape of the radial velocity curves on a time scale of years .",
    "data were not sufficient to conclude whether the modulation is periodic . to the contrary ,",
    "two fundamental mode cepheids studied by @xcite show cycle - to - cycle variations in their radial velocity curves and variation of spectral line features @xcite .",
    "we note that modulation is common in other group of classical pulsators  in rr  lyrae stars , in which it is known as the blazhko effect .",
    "space photometry and top - quality ground - based data indicate that the incidence rate of the blazhko effect in fundamental mode rr  lyr stars ( rrab stars ) is as high as @xmath15per cent ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we report the discovery of periodic modulation in more than 50 fundamental mode classical cepheids observed by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the effect is much more pronounced than any other instability reported in the light curves of fundamental mode cepheids so far .",
    "the resulting changes in the mean brightness may be as large as @xmath9mag in the extreme cases .",
    "we analyse the publicly available data for the fundamental mode classical cepheids of the ogle magellanic cloud collection @xcite .",
    "the collection counts 2739 cepheids in the smc and 2429 cepheids in the lmc .",
    "we analyse the @xmath16-band data only which are much more numerous than the @xmath17-band data .",
    "the ogle - iii and ogle - iv data are provided in the separate files and we analyse them separately .",
    "we note that the ogle - iii data file also contains the data from the second phase of the ogle .",
    "data analysis proceeds in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "we select the stars in which modulation is suspected using the semi - automatic analysis . for each star",
    ", 14th order fourier series is fitted to the data .",
    "severe outliers ( @xmath18 ) are removed .",
    "second order polynomial is fitted to the residual data and subtracted from the original data .",
    "this way , we remove or reduce the possible slow trends from the data .",
    "fourier series is fitted to the detrended and cleaned data again and fourier transform of the residuals is stored in the graphical form for inspection .",
    "featureless spectra , i.e. those in which the @xmath19 for the highest detected peak , are marked as uninteresting and not inspected .",
    "in addition , the data are phased and light curve with fourier fit is stored in the graphical form .    the number of cepheids in which @xmath20 for the highest peak in the residual spectrum is still rather high .",
    "such peaks still may happen by chance , at random locations in the spectrum . in the long - baseline ogle data we consider here , trends are also quite common , and",
    "sometimes the second - order polynomial is insufficient to remove them .",
    "peaks at close - to - integer frequencies are also common artefact of the ground - based data .",
    "these give rise to power excesses , or clumps of peaks , present in the very low frequency range and at close - to - integer frequencies  all mutual daily aliases .",
    "the majority of these cases are easy to identify by inspection of the stored frequency spectrum plots .    among the remaining cases , those illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : fspsmc ] and [ fig : fsplmc ] are the most interesting . in the frequency spectrum",
    "we detect a few significant peaks , frequencies of which are not independent : in the low frequency range , symmetrically placed around fundamental mode frequency , @xmath21 , around @xmath22 and possibly around higher order harmonics",
    ". such peaks may result either because of genuine modulation of pulsation or because of excitation of non - radial modes .",
    "the observed effect is the same  light curve is periodically modulated . later on ( sect .",
    "[ ssect : modulatedqm ] ) , we argue that genuine modulation is the most plausible explanation .",
    "hence , the detected phenomenon is called modulation in the following . in this case ,",
    "frequencies of the detected peaks are denoted as : @xmath23 , for the peak at the low frequency range , @xmath24 , for the peaks at the fundamental mode frequency , @xmath25 , for the peaks at the harmonic , etc .",
    "modulation period is @xmath26 .        , but for three modulated stars from the lmc . ]",
    "all suspected cases are carefully analysed on a case - by - case basis , following a standard consecutive prewhitening technique .",
    "details may be found in our previous publications e.g. in @xcite . for a reference ,",
    "the data are fitted with the sine series of the following form : @xmath27 using non - linear least - square procedure . in the above series",
    ", we include all frequencies identified with the help of fourier transform in the consecutive prewhitening steps : fundamental mode and its harmonics , @xmath28 , modulation side peaks as given above , i.e. @xmath23 , @xmath29 and possibly higher order components of the multiplets .",
    "frequencies , amplitudes and phases are all adjusted .",
    "we stress that our approach is conservative .",
    "we consider the star as modulated only if at least two peaks that can be associated with modulation of the same period are detected in the spectrum with @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , in each case we transform the magnitude data to fluxes to check whether these peaks are intrinsic to the star and are not due to contamination . in case additional signal",
    "is due to contamination , the peaks at linear combination frequencies ( e.g. at @xmath29 ) are not present in the flux data .    in the majority of cases , the modulation is weak and the additional signals are in the mmag range . only in a few cases the signature of modulation is directly visible in the light curve .",
    "the strongest cases from the smc and lmc are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : lcsmc ] and [ fig : lclmc ] , respectively .",

    "before we discuss the results , we first estimate the detection limit in the ogle data in a way similar to our previous work for the first overtone cepheids in the smc @xcite .",
    "estimates are done independently for the lmc and smc and for the ogle - iii and ogle - iv data .",
    "for all fundamental mode cepheids in a given sample , the photometric data are prewhitened with a 14th order fourier series .",
    "fourier transform of the residuals is computed and average signal in the @xmath32 range  the noise , @xmath33 , is computed .",
    "data on spectra in which no strong signal remains ( @xmath34 ) are used to construct the four - times - noise ( the detection limit ) versus the mean @xmath16-band brightness plots .",
    "the resulting smoothed running averages are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise ] for the four samples .",
    "as expected , the noise increases as mean brightness ( and pulsation period ; @xmath35 relation ) decreases .",
    "differences between the four considered data samples result from different observing strategy ( different data sampling ) for the smc and for the lmc during the two phases of the ogle project . for the lmc ,",
    "the noise level is lower in the ogle - iv data and consequently , this data set allows us to detect weaker signals . at the luminosity range covered by the lmc cepheids ,",
    "the typical detection limit is @xmath36mmag . in the case of the smc ,",
    "the difference between the ogle - iii and ogle - iv data is not as pronounced and is in the opposite direction ",
    "the noise level is typically lower in the ogle - iii data .",
    "the smc cepheids are fainter ; the detection limit vary from @xmath37 to @xmath4mmag . in practice , for all interesting stars , the ogle - iii and ogle - iv data were analysed independently .",
    "comparison of the results , yields information on the stability of the detected phenomena . occasionally ,",
    "when long - period modulation was suspected , the ogle - iii and ogle - iv data were merged .",

    "[ tab : smc ] and [ tab : lmc ] , respectively .",

    "asterisk indicates that the associated variability is non - coherent  significant and unresolved power remains after the prewhitening .",

    "our primary choice is ogle - iv , as these data , on average , assure a lower noise level .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , for the smc , the ogle - iii and ogle - iv data are of comparable quality , ogle - iii data being slightly better . for the smc ,",
    "ogle - iii data are used for stars with longer modulation periods . also , if the number of detected modulation peaks is different in the two data sets , we list the results for the data in which more side peaks were detected .",

    "[ tab : smc ] and [ tab : lmc ] indicate , that modulation ( with the same period ) was confirmed also in the other data set , although sometimes the detection was weak ( e.g. only one side peak that could be associated with the modulation was detected ) .",

    "a comparison of the results for the two data sets indicates , that modulation is a stable phenomenon ; in the majority of cases , modulation period and amplitudes of the side peaks agree within formal errors . `",

    "this is marked with ` fx ' or ` sm ' in the remarks column . in the latter case ,",
    "the additional power was detected close to the radial mode frequency , indicating a possible secondary modulation . in no case",
    "however , we detect additional peaks that would correspond to linear frequency combination with the previously detected peaks , in particular with the radial mode frequency . in the majority of cases , these detections are also weak , with @xmath42 .",

    "still we decided to leave the form of tab .",

    "[ tab : smc ] with two modulation periods .",
    "if the highest side peak at radial mode frequency ( at @xmath39 ) , associated with the primary modulation , is interpreted as due to additional mode , then , the corresponding point in the petersen diagram is located at the long - period extension of the f+1o double - mode cepheid sequence ( it is marked with arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : pet ] ) .",
    "although its fundamental mode period is long ( @xmath43d ) and the period ratio , @xmath44 , is a bit too high to match the extension of the f+1o double - mode smc sequence exactly , the scenario in which the peak now associated with modulation is in fact radial first overtone can not be rejected .",
    "we note that @xcite discovered two double - periodic , long - period cepheids in m31 and interpreted them as double - mode f+1o cepheids .",
    "these stars are marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : pet ] with small triangles .",
    "in fact , long - period double - mode pulsation caused by the 2:1 resonance between the fundamental mode and the second overtone , that we have just discussed , was predicted by @xcite , based on analysis of the amplitude equations .",
    "such double - mode pulsation is expected close to the resonance centre , at fundamental mode periods not far from @xmath45d .",
    "resonant double - mode pulsation was reproduced in non - linear pulsation models , very close to the resonance centre ",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "whether such form of pulsation can extend to periods as high as @xmath46d needs to be verified with non - linear calculations .",
    "the possibility is appealing , but the genuine modulation is likely as well .",
    "strong peak at @xmath23 indicates , that mean brightness of the cepheid is modulated .",
    "consequently , the apparent brightness changes over time and so is the distance modulus calculated as the difference between the measured , apparent brightness and absolute brightness computed through the @xmath35 relation . for studies using large sample of cepheids with numerous observations gathered over years , e.g. studies of the structure of the magellanic clouds using the data gathered by photometric sky surveys , like ogle , the effect can be safely ignored .",
    "reasons are the following : ( i ) amplitude of the mean brightness modulation is small , typically well below @xmath9mag ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histo_amps ] , top panel ; we stress however , that through this paper we use fourier amplitudes , so the peak - to - peak variation is roughly two times larger ) ; ( ii ) the effect averages out if the light curve was gathered over longer time base ; ( iii ) except for specific fundamental mode period ranges , the effect is very rare ( fig .  [",
    "fig : histo_ic ] ) .",
    "for the same reasons , the modulation has negligible effect on the use of cepheids in constructing the cosmological distance ladder .",
    "we note that modulation might be weaker in more metal rich systems , as comparison of the lmc and smc suggests ( sect .",
    "[ ssect : witd ] ) .",
    "most of the galaxies used in the calibration of cepheid distance scale are young , metal rich spirals ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "direct detection of modulation in typical observations of cepheids in distant galaxies is unlikely , as the number of gathered epochs is usually small and the photometric accuracy is low .",
    "modulation , if indeed present in the cepheid , will contribute to the minor increase of the light curve scatter .",
    "if only a single pulsation cycle is covered , the mean apparent brightness might be shifted , but by no more than a few mmag . the common approach used in calibration of any standard candles , i.e. observation of sufficiently abundant sample in order to reduce the associated statistical uncertainties , should mitigate the effect of possible modulation in cepheids , which , in any case , is very small .",
    "we have discovered low amplitude , periodic modulation of pulsation in 29 fundamental mode cepheids in the smc and in 22 fundamental mode cepheids in the lmc .",
    "the relative modulation amplitude is low . in all but one case",
    ", it is below @xmath10per cent . in nearly all stars ,",
    "modulation of the mean brightness is detected , which manifests through the presence of prominent peak at the modulation frequency in the frequency spectra of the stars .",
    "amplitude of this modulation is also low . in all but one star , it is below @xmath9mag . in the record holder , ogle - lmc - cep-1647 , amplitude of this peak",
    "is @xmath47mag .",
    "the effect is systematically weaker in the lmc , pointing that it may be metallicity dependent .",
    "modulation periods vary from 30 to more than 1000 d , but in the majority of cases the typical modulation timescale is ten times longer than the pulsation period ( between @xmath48 and @xmath49d ) .    the effect of modulation on the distance determination , using the cepheids period - luminosity relation may be safely ignored .",
    "modulation is rare , of low amplitude and averages out in typical observations gathered over long time base .",
    "although the overall incidence rate is very low , of order of @xmath0per cent in both magellanic clouds , the effect may be more common in specific ranges of the pulsation period .",
    "in particular , in the smc , the incidence rate is @xmath50per cent for cepheids with pulsation periods between @xmath1 and @xmath2d . for the lmc ,",
    "the largest incidence rate is of order of @xmath4per cent for fundamental mode periods between @xmath5 and @xmath6d .",
    "modulation was not detected in any star with pulsation period below @xmath51d .",
    "although in the lmc such short period fundamental mode cepheids are rather rare ( @xmath52per cent of the ogle sample ) , in the smc they constitute the majority of the ogle sample ( @xmath53per cent ) .",
    "modulation in fundamental mode cepheids may be a more common phenomenon , but because of its low amplitude , its detection in the ground - based photometry is challenging .",
    "in several stars we have detected a single peak close to the radial mode frequency or at the low frequency range .",
    "such single periodicity may be due to contamination , but may also indicate a possible modulation .",
    "we note that periodic modulation was detected in v1154  cyg , fundamental mode cepheid ( @xmath54d ) observed with _",
    "modulation period is @xmath55d , but amplitudes of the modulation side peaks are nearly an order of magnitude lower than reported here ; the highest side peak , at @xmath38 , has an amplitude of @xmath56mmag .",
    "just as for the cepheids in the magellanic clouds , the peak at modulation frequency is relatively high , @xmath57mmag .    observations with the photometric space telescopes will be crucial to establish the incidence rate of the light curve modulation in classical cepheids .",
    "the brightest cepheids in the sky will be observed with _ tess _ [ @xcite ; for prospects of cepheid",
    "s observations see @xcite ] , but for the majority of them , observations will be limited to short , 27d - long observing runs  too short to resolve the modulation .",
    "situation will be much better for stars located within and close to the continuous viewing zone , so also for the lmc cepheids .",
    "these are however faint and typically located in the crowded fields  only for the brightest cepheids we can expect photometry allowing to detect the mmag signals .",
    "the origin of modulation remains unknown , however , we speculate that it may be a resonant effect , caused by the 2:1 resonance between the fundamental mode and the second overtone .",
    "this resonance shapes the cepheid bump progression .",
    "in fact , majority of the modulated stars are bump cepheids , with prominent bump feature in their light curves . in the smc ,",
    "the effect is frequent close to the resonance centre .",
    "properties of the modulation vary as pulsation period increases , just as light curve shape evolves due to the resonance .",
    "a thorough study of the relevant amplitude equations and of non - linear pulsation models is planned to verify the resonance hypothesis .",
    "quasi - periodic modulation of pulsation is common in rr  lyr stars , in which it is known as the blazhko effect . in classical cepheids , the modulation was also reported , but so far in a rather specific double - overtone stars , in a few first overtone pulsators and in the oddball , second overtone star , v473  lyr ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) . here",
    ", we have reported the discovery of periodic modulation in the sizeable sample of long - period fundamental mode stars , commonly used as distance indicators .",
    "although the modulation has no practical effect on the use of cepheids as standard candles , it demonstrates that our understanding of these important classical variables is far from being complete .",
